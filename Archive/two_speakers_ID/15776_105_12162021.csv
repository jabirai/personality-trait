15776.0,Patient,I haven't taken in two days.
105.0,Provider,"Oh, my gosh. Okay, so but but Look how you labeled it right. Like my medication, right now, you, you did. you're saying part of the mania is I get forgetful or maybe maybe it's is it impulsive like you keep popping from the next thing, and you don't remember the routine."
15776.0,Patient,"i'm a lot of it is like I did last week, like I said I haven't been really getting much sleep. So when I do fall asleep like it's in the early hours of the morning and I have to go to work like three hours later, so I wake up and i'm still tired, so I got to get up brush my teeth take a shower and then get out the door because i'm going to be late. So I just forget about it and I don't care you on me and then by the time I get home i'm already tired and."
105.0,Provider,"Do you work the exact same schedule each day. Does the schedule, whatever it is, is it static, is it the same. Whatever the. For your for your this this life that you have that's inconvenient."
15776.0,Patient,"yeah it's just. My general manager, we have a lot of inconsistency with people at work where they don't show up they call in they're sick. You just jumbled around my schedule to fit me where she needs me because I told her, I was like why I don't do anything outside of work, I don't have a life i'd like so I can work whenever you need me to."
105.0,Provider,"Is it possible that that might have been true but, as you move forward that might not be true you actually have a life."
15776.0,Patient,I just mean like it's about you know.
105.0,Provider,"I know what you mean. But sometimes if we if we say things. Enough you start to believe them. Like i'm crazy and I don't have a life. like that. because she do, and you do matter."
15776.0,Patient,"i'm just saying, like a personal life like. You know I mean I really don't go out I don't think I don't do that."
105.0,Provider,"And I don't know I don't know that, because you have a girlfriend so i'm learning. What do you do to invest in the relationship with your girlfriend."
15776.0,Patient,"Oh well, we just went Christmas shopping okay."
105.0,Provider,So do shopping. How did that go.
15776.0,Patient,It was okay. I mean I don't like being out and about so it's a lot easier online. Like I don't like the groups of people at the stores people. handle rudeness very well. Like I start being rude right that yeah.
105.0,Provider,You ever find you see a facial expression in your girlfriend That surprises you like oh looks. Like okay so i'm.
15776.0,Patient,Very outspoken.
105.0,Provider,she's outspoken.
15776.0,Patient,"I don't I don't have to wonder about it, I know about it."
105.0,Provider,Do you ever get irritated frustrated. With her something she said and outspoken way.
15776.0,Patient,"From I try not to because for like she's pregnant so her her hormones are really, really all over the place, so like if we're arguing or anything I don't really ever take anything that she says to me too harshly, because I know but she's just all over the place."
105.0,Provider,"has she ever said anything I understand that what you do is you remember a skill, which is i'm not going to take this personally, this is probably about her hormones that's a skill, you have, and you bring to that relationship. But if it wasn't there. because she won't be pregnant forever. Right, so what might be something that you might have perceived as rude possibly or you got offended that's typically we recognize in ourselves oh i'm offended or anything just to move a little bit into some content for a moment."
15776.0,Patient,I mean one time she compared me to her ex boyfriend and I don't like that.
105.0,Provider,Tell me more.
15776.0,Patient,"She just said, I was acting like an ass she said, I was acting like Alex and I was like don't say that."
105.0,Provider,"Okay, what is it that you didn't like about being compared to the asshole."
15776.0,Patient,Though because I was I didn't feel like I was being rude.
105.0,Provider,"So she named called in a sense, instead of addressing the specific behavior. Did you eventually sometimes we start off with that kind of way of communicating and then after time it gets cleared up what was the behavior that she clumped, together with the ass Hillary."
15776.0,Patient,"um I was drinking so. Like, I would like me drinking I guess she said that when I drink I get I mean. And it's not so much that I mean it's just I don't I take even less bullshit that I do now whenever i'm drinking so it's like i'm just like now that bullshit."
105.0,Provider,"Oh. So it's can we capture maybe that's bullshit could we say, maybe that it's not asshole it's, is it possible, it could be said to be dismissive. Would you say that might be what happens to."
15776.0,Patient,yeah.
105.0,Provider,"Like If so, let me just interpret bullshit like I always think of bullshit as equal sign that's not true. Like when I say that's some bullshit. yeah what I made it that's not true. whoa yeah YouTube. Well okay. Is it making you laugh that I talk like that."
15776.0,Patient,"Yes, it did I saw you you actually cracked a smile you did."
105.0,Provider,Okay that's not true. So. skylar for you what's the emotional experience when someone projects. across a boundary and tells you what is true for you. how's it feel when someone says this is how you feel this is the truth.
15776.0,Patient,i'd be bad because people don't know what I feel like you don't know what i'm thinking you don't know how I feel. yeah i'd be upset.
105.0,Provider,"That word that I used pretty useful in therapy, the word boundary. mm hmm and the word projection are those two terms that you kind of know about. Yes, okay that's convenient what is, you can even make up a name I am I gonna do anything with it, except stop calling her girlfriend. that's her first name. lori lori right i'll probably have to ask again because everybody's got one and I always forget what they are so does lori know what the word boundary is. she's had some psychotherapy along."
15776.0,Patient,"In her development oh I don't know. So much that like I was saying yeah I feel like she knows what they are, because she respects my boundaries. So I don't I wasn't saying like I don't know if she knows about the psychotherapy part of it, or just the relationship aspect of having boundaries."
105.0,Provider,"Okay. Do you remember what it was that you may not remember the content, but if you do it'd be kind of interesting for me Do you remember what it was she said. When you had a that's bullshit response Do you remember what."
15776.0,Patient,She was saying that i've been.
105.0,Provider,yeah so it's gone.
15776.0,Patient,yeah.
105.0,Provider,"But you're not sure if. She knows the term what's your definition of it, what if you had to say all right, you know this is how I think of what a boundary is and we're not talking about a literal sense of boundary in a property is different than sort of our internal one What would it."
15776.0,Patient,be in. Being respectful of other people's decisions and feeling. Okay i'm. not trying to force information out of them like if they need to tell me something they'll tell me in their time.
105.0,Provider,ya.
15776.0,Patient,"know the point of view, respect respectful of other people's feelings."
105.0,Provider,"in general. it's a it's a bit of it's exactly what you said that's the doing of it. And it might be that one knows where they end. Right, this is my thought my want my emotion. And where this other person begins so boundary I know where I end, and you begin. you're going to run into people that don't know that."
15776.0,Patient,Right.
105.0,Provider,they're going to look at your face and they're going to go you're you're you're mad at me. And you're going to be inside your own body go and a new. Does that ever happen.
15776.0,Patient,yeah but you know. I don't think it's like they. I just kind of probably looked rude.
105.0,Provider,"rude does I don't know what the hell, that is, but if you look rude it serves a purpose. Right, do you know how how it helps you."
15776.0,Patient,Know you're upset but.
105.0,Provider,"Well, but you weren't upset. But, in general, if you go around let's say, nine out of 10 times, having a rude face let's say how does it help you."
15776.0,Patient,People leave me alone.
105.0,Provider,"that's right and that's what you want, right now, isn't it. Right, it says back to F off. Stay back. And right now that's kind of what you are into like just. And it serves i've worked. Many years with people that have had. Long histories of being incarcerated and that thing you have that stay back. has kept them alive."
15776.0,Patient,"yeah. I mean all of all, I think, like with without my time in juvie just my time that i've done in as an adult it's been about seven years because i've done about three in the county and then or three or four in the county and then three in prison and then juvenile was like 18 months."
105.0,Provider,Does that seem like a lot to you.
15776.0,Patient,"i'm about seven years, seven years, I mean. Almost a third of my life."
105.0,Provider,"So when we talk about. If I call this aspect, what happens in the face. That says stay back. Can I take this emergency call I promise I won't be more than 20 seconds if it's not. Actively emergency. Okay, I do apologize for that what people consider emergency what they don't. So. You know. Is trust, an issue for you do, you find like most people are kind of aren't worth your time getting to know and."
15776.0,Patient,yeah.

Her nose was beating a little bit and the back of her neck right here was all wet and she had to use the restroom on herself."
105.0,Provider,Oh yeah that's how you know oh goodness.
15776.0,Patient,"yeah and I thought for a while that we're gonna have to go put her down and then about a week ago, when the swelling went down on her brain she had a seizure for a couple days like she had like two or three of them, and she hasn't had one since then and she's fine now.

Just as important in the concepts of me and people me and the world like I resonate with it, but for you. Does it ever rise to being troublesome for you that you may not trust easily."
15776.0,Patient,"Occasionally, I mean. yeah. Like if it's new people I really don't trust what they say what they're doing. So, like. A lot of the time I feel like on the cob at walmart you know watching the people stealing so because i'm always watching for people just to see if they're doing something that they shouldn't be like. they're trying to put themselves up if they're trying to lie to me."
105.0,Provider,"Right. Now this is the the layer just below that. You know. How is what you're doing whenever you just said, whatever, that is, how is, how is it. A problem for you."
15776.0,Patient,"It could be good to I don't trust people and people who don't deserve that kind of behavior people who actually trust me, you know I don't even give them a chance. Okay okay."
105.0,Provider,"Fine, now go again another layer below that how is that a problem."
15776.0,Patient,"It causes me to be depleted, no, no."
105.0,Provider,"Okay, there we go, so if we simplified all of that, and we said that you've been conditioned through you know incarceration right that. your mind will automatically for survival reasons automatically go to scanning in congruency is. Another word with just the you know not representing. Right you're scanning you're you're you're. Very good at that a catching bs verbally catching hypocrisy catching anything that doesn't match with what they said and what they did you're going to catch it quickly."
15776.0,Patient,"Yes, majority of the time."
105.0,Provider,"But sometimes, and I think you said it here you're wrong. Right okay. So it's not that we want to get rid of that skill set it's just calling upon it as much as intensely as you do. Is what I would maybe say it's maladaptive to you, investing in friendships in trustworthy people. So let me just ask you this let's flip it on its you know what and what do you do. That helps you trust people, so what skills, do you have that helps you find out if someone's trust worthy."
15776.0,Patient,"um I just listened, a lot of the time."
105.0,Provider,hey listen.
15776.0,Patient,Like I like to listen to people about their problems with bothering them.
105.0,Provider,How does it help you trust someone.
15776.0,Patient,Just gives me a real like in depth look on what they are or how they are. I feel like it just. I really don't know if it helps me trust people.
105.0,Provider,"Yes, we're slowing time down right normally go super fast, but I slow things down a bit right. But yeah so let's let's use and it's it's terribly artificial I realized, we can certainly change the person, but let's use me for a moment. it's important and some might say central. To the effectiveness of a therapeutic relationship is trust. But if i'm not sharing in fact you know more about me, then, believe it or not. Anyone if you can believe that I shared a story about a kitten."
15776.0,Patient,Right.
105.0,Provider,"You don't know if I have children. You may make assessments about what I look like you don't know about certain things you might make some ideas right I got this and you might wonder, like you, making up a story about some things but it's not for me sharing disclosing it is. In this relationship, this one thing listening isn't going to get you there."
15776.0,Patient,So is there.
105.0,Provider,"yeah so but I did you know, I have a lot, it was very intentional me sharing that story with you like, and later on, I can talk to you about how I decided to do that, but let's keep going with how in here. I could earn your trust."
15776.0,Patient,"See when. I really feel like I don't have to distress, do you like, I already trust you i'm about to. tell you I know that you can't be you can't tell nobody else. So I mean no. reason to not trust you or your judgment."
105.0,Provider,"Well, OK, so the profession itself the presumption is I hold to my ethical responsibilities and confidentiality not telling anyone but couldn't in side here. I will be. hurtful couldn't I still do some damage."
15776.0,Patient,yeah I mean of course everybody has that capability.
105.0,Provider,"Have you had therapist before yeah. yeah you have and what did those therapists and I have in common, aside from the professional responsibility of keeping confidentiality."
15776.0,Patient,"Well, first therapist all she ever did was make me play video or like board games with her and she tried to talk to me, and it would it really didn't help because all more enjoy the game, but I was in like fifth grade, so I was like 10 years old."
105.0,Provider,yeah so play therapy okay.
15776.0,Patient,"yeah i'm. After that, like the second time I was probably about 16 years old, and he was a male counselor. And I was a little ass I was a day. Like. When you bother responding to what he said, like I just go in and be like bro like i'm here for an hour you're here for the money. To pay for my Internet just be me alone."
105.0,Provider,"Okay, no, there was no trust."
15776.0,Patient,"me I have progressed and gotten older I realized that there's no reason for me not to trust you and you seem like you're very trustworthy like Okay, you see, like. I mean i'm just again that's my assumptions based on I. don't know."
105.0,Provider,yeah I know you don't but they're there they're there. they're there and they could have come to you through. The gut.
15776.0,Patient,Right.
105.0,Provider,"Sometimes, if we tune in we don't have the words to describe the yeses and the nose that we feel men like oh I to set this boundary like I don't know why I don't want to hang out with this dude has got a bad vibe."
15776.0,Patient,well.
105.0,Provider,"And it could be your guts messaging you. So if we just stay focused here on how you can trust we know won't be much in the listening you won't but I mean there might be some things I talked about that you might get a sense of. Issues not talking about certain things that maybe don't fit in the therapeutic relationship so you could listening still important, and you also. can enjoy the benefits of some professionalism, the constraints of that. And you already gave me trust upfront you gave it to me and then i'll either keep it or i'll lose it, but you gave it to me up front. You think that there might have been something that happened. Maybe in a group that could have contributed to that is that possible, do you see anything ever happened in there, we thought hmm. I might be able to trust this woman."
15776.0,Patient,I mean just the last five minutes that I was going to trust you.
105.0,Provider,"Did the first time, but even with that psychosocial how."
15776.0,Patient,"very long she's. very sweet these people, she actually wants to help she's actually here and enjoys her job. was like she was here to want to help people she's not here for the money okay."
105.0,Provider,"And that was in group that was your first five minutes was in a group wasn't it. got it Okay, so your first impression wasn't that wicked psychosocial it was in group, you could see that my investment is in the service to others I seem Nice, I want to help, and you decided to give me that trust okay well. let's see if it translates which, with the little bit of time that we have. I want you to picture. How you could use that same skill of watching and listening, because a lot of our data comes from our ears and our eyes. And you did a lot of it by looking and listening in that group setting. Right, how could you use. I guess it's a measure of niceness of someone and their. willingness to help."
15776.0,Patient,"I was and like you just look you're very genuine like you're just putting word. genuinely a good person like you said looking and listening, I mean you can without without needing somebody with you like them or not due to your gut feeling."
105.0,Provider,got so your gut might actually be able to hone in on honesty.
15776.0,Patient,I just don't know if it's like so much at my gut can hone in on is just like i've been lied to enough in my life that I recognize when some people are lying.
105.0,Provider,Sometimes it's off.
15776.0,Patient,All. liars.
105.0,Provider,"But we had, how are we going to know you know, unless you wait months or years to measure it against things that can be difficult, yes um. There was this thing this word help. Because you know i'm thinking about other people and you're being in the world of other people that are untrustworthy and how it can be a bit maladaptive because we are created, we are these social critters. And so, if we need to be having this this sort of social engagement and if we can dial up the skills of being able to tune into you know. How to read, whether someone's trustworthy I think what I might like to do next time because we're running out of minutes is i'm going to share. I don't have my old one, because my hard drives on but I had this really great comparison of healthy boundaries in a relationship and unhealthy and it's a great place to start, I think. To say oh. This word help that you are able to say that happens to be here out there in the world. You may not be looking for someone to only help you but you know you might be looking for someone who has the capability of this word called reciprocity. which I don't know if you know if it's fun word I use it now because it's encapsulates like this big thought and the big thought is. I can give to you, and you can give to me so although it's not one sided like i'm one sided i'm only going to be in the service of I won't be doing any taking. Right I get I do get money but that allows me to be just one thing for you. and you're not used to help relationships my emotional state, etc, so it allows for that purity and clarity i'm wondering if you started to look around and that could be something to play with this week is to look around for people that were able to give and then they shut up. And they allowed you to give but in portions. Not too much because one sign of poor boundaries is over, sharing."
15776.0,Patient,Great.
105.0,Provider,"Man tells their whole life story. like ours, of all the abuse and on and on and on and on that's not a boundary behavior. They can't see your boundary when they do that. they're likely to do that kind of thing again. Right, so one skill to keep your out for it, you may notice it since i'm bringing it up throughout the week someone who shares a little bit like a kitten story they share a little portion and then you share one, and then you wait and you get to watch whether this person can hold. As precious this thing that they shared, can you hold what they shared carefully and tenderly or do you go blab it make fun of it. You see that's how we develop trust is we share a little bit ago let's see how you handle this thing this gift I just gave you I gave you a little secret give you a little some how are you I am I walked. And maybe they trust me with their tiny little share oh yeah I used to I used to I wasn't doing all the time, this person might say they just gave you something to measure how you'll handle. Something vulnerable in them that's a great place to start. is to you share just a tiny bit with someone you watch and listen how they handle it. And they give you a little and then you're careful with it. What would that be like in the coming time I don't know how much social exposure, you have you have it at work and maybe people you work with etc, but just to keep an eye on that. Am I willing to. share a little. In order to see whether this person is trustworthy and are they able to share a little just watch that and that would be. watching boundaries. Okay, just keep an eye on it and then come back and tell me, you may forget as soon as you hang up with me that's fine too, but for some people, they like the notion of homework, with the long term goal of enhancing relationships through. trust, and so this might be a place to start okay. Okay i'm really glad you're here. I was thinking you might not."
15776.0,Patient,Oh. yeah.
105.0,Provider,This group was rough.
15776.0,Patient,Oh yeah.
105.0,Provider,"Well, what we can, I was gonna say Oh, maybe we'll process that we can totally do it or not, but I just want you to know you can always do that you can say ah, you know do whatever you want. Because this has got to be a safe place for you to to the you. Alright well i'm i'm psyched that you are here. Next week's a little crappy only because I don't have a Friday right, so this there's no services there. What if we do something a little different and pushed it forward just to touch and met i've got lots of openings. If you'd like this Thursday sich we could do something like it again, we could do nine o'clock gosh I have nines all across the week is there a preferred day for a 9am that you like."
15776.0,Patient,"Thursdays, I usually work 7am to 11am, but I just I let my boss, you know so that way I had it off right now. I go in at 1pm today instead i'm. Wednesdays I go in, and I think i'll be there to let him because Wednesdays, or I have to like that's the day, where I run the shift like that's a set day."
105.0,Provider,Do you want to meet at nine on December 29 instead.
15776.0,Patient,On Wednesday.
105.0,Provider,it's Wednesday.
15776.0,Patient,"i'm the 29th I. don't know like I said, my girlfriend has her C. section on the 20th."
105.0,Provider,"So the 20th that's nine days later, so you're wondering so you'll be helping her with baby."
15776.0,Patient,Care yeah.
105.0,Provider,"Do you want to go earlier, what do you want to do."
15776.0,Patient,know we can try for Wednesday.
105.0,Provider,Okay y'all know the night before probably and then we can we'll know Monday or Tuesday we'll we'll just get something in here and we can change it if we need to. So we've got December 29 at 9am just repeat that back so I know it made it through audio and then I gotta jump out and chat with someone.
