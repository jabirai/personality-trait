11277.0,Patient,"Well don't want me to drive back and forth, and I can drive a half hour each way every day."
706.0,Provider,um. I mean I you know I didn't get transferred over here I don't want to be on probation this county. yeah. might be better than doing six months mandatory time though.
11277.0,Patient,yeah but no I don't know.
706.0,Provider,No.
11277.0,Patient,Demand for a six month the minimum one I think it's like six to 10 days. uh huh so I mean I wouldn't have wandered and I don't want it it's just.
706.0,Provider,You have a history to.
11277.0,Patient,So right.
706.0,Provider,"that's going to influence their decision on how much time you get unfortunately so. Really, probably won't get the minimum you may not get the maximum you make something in between i'm."
11277.0,Patient,"Up to the mountain time I know like um it's been a long time since i've even had a needle charge, to be honest with you, I know, sometimes a lot you do the minimum days and then kind of sit the other time, like holding your head type thing yeah."
706.0,Provider,yeah like.
11277.0,Patient,"Yes, you."
706.0,Provider,Do.
11277.0,Patient,"Yes, they differ and raised Well, I do have some time in, but at the same time. or your Lord. and try to do something with my treatment. And guarded. don't you all right offer up."
706.0,Provider,"yeah well if they if they differ and then you have an issue, then you would have to do the complete amount of time, rather than the shorter amount of time. But not happen to. wow Well that is unfortunate that is definitely not anything you needed added to your plate with everything else you have going on um. How is your daughter."
11277.0,Patient,"She knows she's. I don't know she tells me that she will leave my whole her whole life for me to grow up and like Canada you don't you need to look into addiction, or is it more like I thought she was a little more understanding than I realize. I tourists and addiction has nothing to do with growing up. it's."
706.0,Provider,it's a disease.
11277.0,Patient,And I try not to her and she just joined here she's like whatever you want to go up. And was like really isn't has nothing does it like I wish you'd honestly was in look into what i'm saying so just assuming it has grown up.
706.0,Provider,So.
11277.0,Patient,that's the case I said over give me a high 75 people in your life on growing up in some runner 70s. As it has nothing to do with it mm hmm.
706.0,Provider,So um. So she went to juvie.
11277.0,Patient,mm hmm.
706.0,Provider,And then she came out. How she been doing since she's been out.
11277.0,Patient,"She hasn't been any fights that I know of. Okay, but i'm figure she'll tell me how to say it anyway, so I wouldn't probably find out anyways."
706.0,Provider,"Well, is she still on probation."
11277.0,Patient,yeah but they don't get you're doing she's not to tell me.
706.0,Provider,Okay um she's still on house arrest.
11277.0,Patient,know she has a curfew now.
706.0,Provider,Okay does she follower curfew.
11277.0,Patient,"No, not really."
706.0,Provider,"So does she know that they can drop in at any point in time and if she's not there, then she's in violation of her probation."
11277.0,Patient,yeah I think she's a queen she still thinks she's untouchable. Like all then i'm going to copy because i'm not doing nothing.
706.0,Provider,"They you know they send out. What we call here the HR you the high risk unit that checks on people on probation and to make sure that they're doing what they're supposed to be doing, not so much you know. you're not doing what you're supposed to be doing so we're going to catch you but we're going to make sure you're doing what you're supposed to be doing, you know. They don't need to report that somebody doing something wrong, of course, then we'll look into it, but they will just randomly drop in they have to do so many droppings during the time you're on probation."
11277.0,Patient,"And that's what I try to tell her, but she got she I don't know anything."
706.0,Provider,"I thought, maybe her going to do the might have opened up her eyes a little bit."
11277.0,Patient,"I mean yeah but no. I she says it's changed, and she want to go back and this happens in our actions aren't same so."
706.0,Provider,"Well, if she keeps doing the things that she's doing she's gonna go back. And it probably just won't be for a short stint they'll probably keep her there. um."
11277.0,Patient,"And then I guess they mess up in her work and her charging and I guess they're only making her do you have maximum 90 days is what she's saying, but I don't know."
706.0,Provider,Okay.
11277.0,Patient,"So, for instance, I know for sure they can go back to the Court docket they want you and reimburse whatever there's a court."
706.0,Provider,Oh yeah definitely.
11277.0,Patient,"i'm sleeping says no her P, I talked about, they said on 90 days they can't change them like yes, it can but."
706.0,Provider,I.
11277.0,Patient,was wondering on ourselves.
706.0,Provider,"yeah the courts can do anything that they want pretty much I mean they're kind of that final word um. So how long has it been, since you last used."
11277.0,Patient,i'm going on two weeks.
706.0,Provider,Going on two weeks. Back on your medicine feeling decent.
11277.0,Patient,Young have a little appetite not not tremendous but I don't ever usually have a big opportunity anyways.
706.0,Provider,um do you feel any withdraw any cravings.
11277.0,Patient,Still. still struggling with the sleep thing gave myself some kind of a team mm hmm um. I don't know just real tired feeling okay.
706.0,Provider,"But no real like cravings or withdrawal just well the yawning yawning is a big one, and I can see you've got a lot of yawning."
11277.0,Patient,we're still going to live in my swatch everyone's role or hot. i'm still getting real hot sweaty.
706.0,Provider,So kind of like when you first started at like way back when you first quit and then you got on the medication you kind of have that that interim like clamming is cold sweats hotspots.
11277.0,Patient,"Show you guys it's like. it's really hot like burn my skin, building on fire. Usually about 20 minutes after I taken for our two and then it will fully wins way mm hmm."
706.0,Provider,"So that should get better the longer that you're back on and as your body builds that up and gets those receptors plugged completely so that you don't have urgency to go use. When you don't feel like you're in withdraw. So that's good What about i'm staying busy, are you trying to stay busy."
11277.0,Patient,"I started cleaning the House up had all have one point there every division house with dirty. got all that, on occasion, taking care of a disclaimer whoa around like clans been a long time. yeah so I don't know I just figured get the House back in order and then go from there, I guess."
706.0,Provider,"Well, and you'll feel better to mentally when you live in a place that's clean and organized you won't feel so chaotic in your head. And a lot of times when you go through a period of active using during relapse all of those things kind of take the backseat like you don't think about cleaning your house or doing your dishes are doing those daily things because you fall."
11277.0,Patient,back up to it. Like no interest in doing it.
706.0,Provider,"yeah you have no motivation you fall back into old behaviors so it's good that you're getting back into that I want my house to be clean, I wanted to be organized like I feel better. And you're doing it a little bit at a time, because I think that's going to be beneficial to you when you can look around and see chaos everywhere."
11277.0,Patient,"We help him it's just not getting her to at least bugging orange traditions off, I mean I understand you're doing but very least just runs to shut off, and I know she just woke up your lazy and drives me nuts."
706.0,Provider,mm hmm so.
11277.0,Patient,just get should have rejected or play up from Where are you sitting out and she ate it she does she puts it in a sinkhole Arizona place.
706.0,Provider,"hmm some of that's typical teenager I have one that's very similar I mean like I find plates in his room and the family room downstairs you know just kind of wherever he finished eating. And I go through the same thing so some of us typical teenager some of it could be also rebelling against you, because she's angry, because she relapsed so she could be just like you know what screw you man you decided to use drugs so screw you i'm not going to do anything. can be part of an."
11277.0,Patient,Ongoing thing with her like I just can't get her to help me ship.
706.0,Provider,"uh huh so I mean and and the other thing too, you know, especially with this recent relapse you need to ask yourself. You know, with all of the stress and depression and everything that that her actions are putting in motion, you know, with all of the things that you've had to go through, is it time that you say you know what you can't live here anymore. You know, like this, this this isn't going to work it's not good for my health and it's not good for your health and safety because you're not making any changes, you know, is it about time to maybe take that stance and say she can't be here anymore."
11277.0,Patient,All that kind of puts me in a hard spot to you because they're reopening her case you're wearing shoes to. your father.
706.0,Provider,"Okay, so."
11277.0,Patient,I know if I told you about that are not what she wanted and. She was molested by her dad and she was younger.
706.0,Provider,mm hmm.
11277.0,Patient,"from two to the prior 11 1011 ish. Okay, so um her counselors getting the case reopen becca."
706.0,Provider,Why is it being reopened.
11277.0,Patient,Because he was found not guilty basically because he passed away.
706.0,Provider,"Okay, so they're opening it to."
11277.0,Patient,Her counselor thinks that that's part of the reason she's doing things she's doing.
706.0,Provider,it's very possible.
11277.0,Patient,That allegations were somewhat those signatures in it. So I think to kind of just like help her with her coping what she went through.
706.0,Provider,"yeah so I mean absolutely it's like I said before she definitely need some counseling there's obviously some trauma that's happened in our past that she needs to deal with. And that she's just stuffing down deep inside and she's acting out, you know, and that is not going to help her that's not going to help her change or be successful in life. and using that as an excuse for her behaviors is not going to help her either, because at some point, you know the difference between right and wrong, so you can be angry resentful. and hurt and fearful, and all of these things that she feels confused, whatever it may be, but at the end of the day at 13 years old, she knows."
11277.0,Patient,The difference between.
706.0,Provider,"right and wrong, and so you can't use that as an excuse it's like I tell my son, he has really severe ADHD and. he's very impulsive. And I was like I get that, but you have some control and, at the end of the day, you still know the difference between right and wrong you're still making those choices. No matter you know what you think has you know caused you to do it, you still know the difference between right and wrong. Right and so that's The thing that has to be instilled in them, because you know they're teenagers and then before you know what they're going to be adults. And if they don't have those things instilled in them, then they're looking at jail time prison time you know, like you, don't get just a slap on the wrist when you're 18 and you do something messed up you go to jail you go to prison, you know and affects their whole life. So she really needs to deal with whatever pain, she has. All of that anger, I mean she's she fights for a reason she's getting out aggression, you know I put my son in football was like take it out on the field if you're angry, you know because he. he's had. His dad as far as like not having a strong relationship and he's angry like take it out on the field go out on that football field and slam into people you know."
11277.0,Patient,Right.
706.0,Provider,"that's a more positive way to get rid of that aggression, so you know he plays all these sports to get rid of all that aggression. You know and. You know, for her she's fighting she's taken that anger and that resentment and that whatever she feels towards her dad towards you for what you've done in your past, for your slip up now, whatever it may be. And she's taking it out on other people because she's not figured out a way to express it appropriately, and that is why she desperately needs counseling and she has to allow somebody to help her. Visa she's going to just sit in there and say nothing it's. not going to do any good. You know and and that just causes more stress on you that just causes you to have more stress and more trigger it's not that it, you know that's an excuse to say Oh well, you were triggered so you used it's not an excuse, but you have a disease. And that disease you're always going to fight against, and so the more barriers, you can put between yourself and using the better, you know. And that's the mean that's the thing you know it's it's hard to change those behaviors it's hard to not go back to what you know helped me feel so helpless. You know. And i'm yeah probably how you felt was just really helpless and hopeless and depressed and you're just like well this will make me feel better for a little bit, but in actuality it now has cost you more."
11277.0,Patient,Problems right.
706.0,Provider,yeah. Did you don't see that at the time.
11277.0,Patient,You know you don't see.
706.0,Provider,"That so you know it's it's hard and it's hard once you relapse to you know get back on track, but you know you're doing it, you can keep doing it. You know just keep showing up, I mean that's the big thing show up for your group show up for your therapy show up because if you're showing up that means you're not out using."
11277.0,Patient,yep.
706.0,Provider,"You know and and that's and you just can go day by day, you know, and sooner or later, those two weeks turn into two months turn into two years you know it just. It just happens it just becomes kind of a habit every day you just have to retrain your brain, you know you don't lose all the all of that clean time that you had. All that recovery time you don't lose it that's yours you own it you, you did that you put that effort in you had a bump in the road, and now you just keep going forward. You know. Lisa a bump in the road didn't throw you off course, completely. You know where you want a totally different direction, at least, it was just a bump in the road and then you got back on and you're traveling down that road of recovery again, you know that says a lot, you know that you could slip up and come back some people slip up and don't come back."
11277.0,Patient,No guilt and shame and.
706.0,Provider,yeah absolutely so much guilt so much shame so it's good to see you i'm glad that you came back i'm glad that you made your appointment today.
11277.0,Patient,set my alarm kind of early. give up.
706.0,Provider,yeah so um and I do the care group on Friday mornings.
11277.0,Patient,"I still need one group, this week, at least."
706.0,Provider,yep so and I it's at 10 eight so 10am because you're.
11277.0,Patient,"going to be the last, but it and I forgot that. I was at 10 and I have my alarm set for noon."
706.0,Provider,yeah it's that.
11277.0,Patient,One i'm like dang it takes a day that's at 10 o'clock yeah. My dad's a tendon I toys toys look online last week.
706.0,Provider,No i'm Fridays it's at 10 so like I said you're more than welcome to come to that group and sometimes you might be the only one there too. So there's been some groups where I haven't had anybody there's been some group store i've just had a couple it just kind of depends on who needs what so.
11277.0,Patient,I they get to get me back on Thursday to.
706.0,Provider,"Thursday, which are normal group."
11277.0,Patient,"While I was trying I try to schedule before the that way in case something happens and I can't make it, though, I still have Friday there as backup. But for some, they are giving her short counselor so they don't have to be they canceled groups on Thursdays."
706.0,Provider,"Okay, so you'll want to talk to the vc and find out what where you can make up your groups, I know that I have that Friday group that can make up a group. But other than that during the week i'm not sure I have, I have a Monday group and a Tuesday group that are both at 12pm your time. um that are opioid use disorder groups so potentially you might be able to come to one of those two, but you would have to talk to the virtual clinic and see if they can fit you in because there's we only can have so many people in a group. Okay, because if there's. A mountain yeah. Because it."
11277.0,Patient,"was too much because I got a group on Tuesdays at six and they told me, I was only group on Tuesday."
706.0,Provider,"yeah so it just depends on you know how many are registered for that group because you can only have so many in a group, and then it gets too big to actually be able to facilitate because there's just too many people and not enough time."
11277.0,Patient,"Okay, that makes sense, and I was wondering why they said there's like one time slot."
706.0,Provider,"mm hmm yeah so you can talk to them and see you know potentially there might be because we've we you know we definitely fluctuate you know people discharge people you know, whatever it may be, so there could potentially be an opening, I would just talk to the virtual clinic and ask them. Okay okay."
11277.0,Patient,"That makes sense to you like, rice and, like every group i've gone to somebody like me and one other person, maybe two other people. hmm but it's because other it's already the other groups are important, which is just like the next group start the next group. yeah."
706.0,Provider,"So i'm just talk to vc and they can give you your options and then you can kind of choose what to work for you, but definitely keep showing up. Definitely keep fighting that fight, you know don't go back to that dark place if you can because sometimes it's even harder to crawl out of it, the second time."
11277.0,Patient,"yeah I think our accounts were comes here today, after school."
706.0,Provider,Okay. So battle.
11277.0,Patient,"Somebody text me tell me they're coming to the after school by i'm guessing less why because it's not a probation officer. Daily today. Sure, I don't know if this is real. You haven't worked with them."
706.0,Provider,"Well, hopefully, she sees the light, you know, and you would think that she would look at, for instance, you and the things you've gone through and the things you're going through. Currently, because you had your relapse and now the Court charges, you would think she'd be like oh geez I don't want to have that happen, I need to make changes I don't want to go down that same path you know learn from your mistakes, but she's trucking along down that path."
11277.0,Patient,"She she's she's got the little things like that, like I I think well because, like she's always giving a shit about smoking. And then, this whole you know, last 12 years give me the hardest thing about smoking and now she's baking mm hmm are."
706.0,Provider,Different it's really like.
11277.0,Patient,"What do you give them ownership or if you're doing the same damn thing because your tastes a little different than mine does it again, it says. dope up nicotine mm hmm."
706.0,Provider,"yeah it's still a drug and nicotine is the hardest struggle to kick even above above opioids above methamphetamines above anything nicotine is the hardest thing to kick and stay and and keep off of it there's people that quit for years and then use, and then they started smoking again. And then they're hooked again, you know it's just it's that quick. it's yeah it's definitely. you've got enough on your plate you don't need to try and quit smoking, too, because i'll just add to it."
11277.0,Patient,"makes no sense to me that she now she's baby and. they're getting a hard time options okay now your baby whatever am I, giving us your outcome, excuse me where we're doing the same damn thing."
706.0,Provider,"Well, and and she doesn't have an excuse anyway because you're an adult you're over the age of 18 and if you choose. To use tobacco waste, you make."
11277.0,Patient,"he's like saying that about her asthma. Just reminded me of above my asthma and now she's rocking out that's why I said don't even say number your damn as broke as you're sitting there, smoking is not that's way worse than me smoke around yeah."
706.0,Provider,yeah well exactly and she shouldn't even be smoking she's under age it's illegal.
11277.0,Patient,I know.
706.0,Provider,"You know so she shouldn't even be smoking. And as far as beeping who knows what they're going to come up with in 10 years that baby has done to people, you know when people first started smoking cigarettes, nobody said they're horrible for you. It took them, you know 15 years before like ooh it causes lung cancer, you should probably stop doing that you know it causes, you know premature babies it causes all."
11277.0,Patient,The damn things that come through.
706.0,Provider,"yeah so I mean but vapes who knows in 10 years they might come back and say that you know it causes whatever brain tumors you know who knows who knows what it, you know who knows."
11277.0,Patient,"Right, since I seen something yesterday in males especially cost so Jackie relation."
706.0,Provider,"Oh yeah well, that will be a problem for males."
11277.0,Patient,"And like maybe here next the next the next group of kids and available, just like. About 12 1310 years will be really good."
706.0,Provider,"there's a lot of young ones out there, a thing they think it's the cool thing to do, that's why they stopped doing flavored vapes because all the kids were using them."
11277.0,Patient,or they got even more flavor David here there's by 10 rounds of funding babes need gas station you're.

706.0,Provider,"yeah it's it's crazy but um what I want you to do before the next time that we meet is to just start journaling so when you're feeling like kind of restless uneasy. racing thoughts those kinds of things I want you to journal that so that you get it out of your head so it'll calm you more so it won't be. It won't be something that will be you'll be focused on because it will be out of your head and on paper. And it actually really works, once you put it on paper it's like you take it out of your head, so your thoughts want races much you should sleep better and you should be able to have more clear thought process. Rather than have all of these things rolling through you're happy as i'm sure you've got 50,000 different thoughts in your head at all times appears you've."

Okay, see if that helps to calm some of those thoughts, because you definitely need to be getting sleep, good quality sleep that's one of the big thing it's very important. And that's going to help with your appetite to if you're getting more sleep you're going to your appetites going to regulate you know, things will go back to normal there'll be more regulated. And you'll feel better because your chemicals will start to balance out again and have you know you won't feel so overwhelmed and. yeah and exhausted well if your brain goes all the time and it never shuts down that's exhausting in itself."
