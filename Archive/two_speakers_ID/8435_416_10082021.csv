I did call her and find out, she was in the hospital she was in the hospital overnight that first night and then I picked her up from the hospital. the morning after I got there so that was a little worrisome um. But the timing of it was good and some good came out of it, as we are, as she was coming out of the hospital building, there was a therapy dog team going into the hospital. So I had a quick chat with that with them gave him my number and journey had his first visit to a long term care facility as a therapy dog and training. um. yeah you know in my mom's been doing better since she went in, and you know got some fluids, and everything um, but it is possible that she might do some back and forth trips to the er and just with her blood count being so low and everything. um my classes are online i'm only taking like for just enough to qualify for financial aid so i'm not overloaded at all um school wise. Okay i've already found some photographer gigs and have already taken photos and sold photos so. wow i'm still keeping things afloat there um I went out to the movies, with a close friend of mine um."

416.0,Provider,I imagine it's been hard for her to keep up with.
8435.0,Patient,"It yeah. I mean. Not just like the cancer, but with how exhausting the chemo has made her."
416.0,Provider,Oh yeah.

She helped me with my testosterone injection last night. You know just just being moral support, and you know just being there, and you know, even though, like it still took like 10 minutes for me to do it, but she was still like there's just counting down for me. You know, really, she does still slip up here and there, but that's because she's known me one way for a long time, and she is trying i'm. of my godmother came over and I got to see her, and they were correcting each other so that's a good sign."
416.0,Provider,"That is a good side. and emotional, how is."
8435.0,Patient,Like I said it's bittersweet one being i'm glad i'm here i'm glad I was able to get the opportunity to be here i'm glad i'm able to see friends and spend time with my mom but also the reality of it is a little painful you know.

416.0,Provider,yeah yeah. Are you afraid to.
8435.0,Patient,I think so.
416.0,Provider,Where do you ride might happen.
8435.0,Patient,I don't know. I guess just I don't want to accept it as it is you know.
416.0,Provider,Absolutely. it's a bitter pill to swallow.
8435.0,Patient,yeah.
416.0,Provider,Just you know worry that that grief that that fear that sadness that whatever it is living in you right now.
8435.0,Patient,Right.
416.0,Provider,"And there really isn't any way to run away from it, so, while I totally understand why you would not want to allow yourself to feel it i'm also worried that you're not."
8435.0,Patient,"You know I before I got down I started to and they when I got down here, it was just like. I kind of went backwards, a little bit where i'm occupying myself to the point where i'm not really thinking about it or processing it. So I know I need to take a step back, take a deep breath and let myself kind of work through this little bit more yeah I need to slow down a little bit. But it's hard you know."
416.0,Provider,"yeah it is. And you can do hard things. So let me ask you this, when you. When you with this may be hard to imagine but. After all is said and done."
8435.0,Patient,mm hmm.
416.0,Provider,In order for you to to go back home to the bay area and feel like. This experience that you're having right now is exactly what you needed it to be an exactly what she needed it to be. What would it be like what would that look like.
8435.0,Patient,"um. I don't know how to answer that. that's a very hard question yeah I mean I, what I want is for it to be a really. Good visit, I want to be helpful, and I want to."
416.0,Provider,I think you're answering it.
8435.0,Patient,You know I want. Now. I wanted to be here on you know until she's gone pretty much.
416.0,Provider,So yeah I hear what i'm hearing is like you want to be really present you want to be helpful.
8435.0,Patient,mm hmm.
416.0,Provider,"And you, you want to be like connected to her and comfort her as as she passes if that's what's gonna happen."
8435.0,Patient,"yeah. You know, and hopefully I you know i'm hoping to get into next year and still be here um you know I as much as I know, i've needed and want to go back to the bay area I want that to happen later than sooner, because if i'm going back to the bay area in means. You know so it's like."
416.0,Provider,yeah.
8435.0,Patient,it's just that is tough to.
416.0,Provider,"yeah. So I think a lot of it is is really about just. Working on mindfulness in the sense that you are. And you are as present, as you can be for her and for yourself to honor whatever is going on right. And that isn't to suggest at all that you. That you might not need time away breaks and all of me, we talked about that last time. it's yeah it's it's about trying to find that balance I think right."
8435.0,Patient,"yeah you know and i've made sure that you know, for the most days I have been here, you know i've taken you know pretty much weekends are when I kind of get away, and you know, make sure i'm not being a full time caretaker. But during the week i'm making sure that she gets to where she needs to go and she's taken care of and you know, there was. One night, where I went into check on her and she'd already fallen asleep but hadn't had dinner yet so you know I. tried waking her up, and it was she couldn't wake up, so I kind of went back on the computer and worked on some photos and checked in on her again, and she was finally able to wake up and i'm just like needy, you know. yeah so and she she was really appreciative and just like she she's like i've never had someone to really cook for me before and there's like well yeah you're fighting something you gotta keep people in the body and you gotta eat. You know and."
416.0,Provider,you're a good son.
8435.0,Patient,Now you try.
416.0,Provider,yeah. i'm sorry that you're going through this. When you were you able to talk to hear. Your girl crush about it.
8435.0,Patient,"yeah yeah we We talked a little bit, and you know she talked about some of the stuff that she's going through right now with her mom and you know her mom's becoming more along the lines of going from. casual drinking alcohol alcoholism and. You know it's. I wouldn't wish that on anybody it's really, really tough. and her brother who's been in and out of jail has broken into her mom's house and."
416.0,Provider,she's got a lot going on off.
8435.0,Patient,it's it's some pretty bad stuff she's had some very toxic family situations and with. Her dad now is. How do you put it.
416.0,Provider,I don't.
8435.0,Patient,Remember the term for it. But he's very overbearing and gaslights her and. Just not a very good. Parental. Anything really so.
416.0,Provider,I heard mom and dad still together.
8435.0,Patient,"No, no they're separated they both live in the same town, but are separated and. he's remarried to. A very strange step mom. I remember doing dinner at their house one night long time ago and. she's very bizarre. Right. Out there. and never really been like a step mom type figure to my friend. So it's just weird. yeah. Oh yeah she's got some pretty tough family dynamics going on."
416.0,Provider,I mean good that you guys can be there for each other through this right.
8435.0,Patient,"yeah I mean even through high school, we were always the high anxiety friends that related to each other, and you know, certainly the stuff that you know we would feel, but the other people in our Group of Friends kind of couldn't really understand, we were able to really get each other. Now. So we've always kind of been you know a good support system for each other."
416.0,Provider,"yeah it seems like you guys, you know you can support each other through this and. yeah. well. i'm sorry I am encourage you definitely to you know rely lean heavily into those. Those skills that you already have around like mindfulness around connections. And sort of lean in as much as you can to the emotions that come with all of this, so that they don't hate you all at once."
8435.0,Patient,"yeah and honestly when I did the therapy visit with journey at the long term memory care facility. That was a little therapeutic to me I don't know why, but it really was just standing there and letting journey lean into somebody who you know they knew that there. There were of the dog and loving on them and everything in you know this elderly lady grabbed my hand said Thank you so much, you made my year you know just this just that feel good experience just you know just like wow like."
416.0,Provider,it's a mood booster.
8435.0,Patient,"yeah yeah it's like. Volunteering your time is I mean cuz aside like these people get many visitors or anything you know, some of them may not even have family anymore. And it's just it was. Something else you know. yeah something i'm definitely going to keep doing. Even though I same time was like really hard, but it was just like it, it was the only thing I can say is it was really therapeutic for me to go there and have that positive impact on people. 90% of it was journey making people feel good but I."
416.0,Provider,mean journeys. Journeys kind of good at that you know.
8435.0,Patient,"And he's really good boy, and he told him to go say hi with he would. Rest his head in their lap and sit with them, and you know one guy he just gently put as Paul on the guys laughing and rested his head on top of this pond it was really cute."
