So I made an emergency plan, I went in i'm talking to the dentist i'm all worried, I said I keep having dreams of my teeth falling out i'm so freaked out right now, because my teeth are loops and he said. Every everybody can move the teeth in their mouth. I said what. Everybody can move the teeth in their mouth and he left. And then the dental hygienists came in, I said, let me ask you this, can you move the teeth in your mouth, because what are you talking about. Just just told me. that everybody can move the teeth in their mouth. No, of course not. All I got I got home, I told my ex he called he. raged then we got a letter okay you're not allowed to come to her dental office anymore. And I had to go look for another dentist that would be handled and what happened was my bike was off and every time I bit down, I was in constant conflict with my bottom T my bottom teeth are becoming loose because my bite was completely off. So the next dentist I went to he said Oh, this is what we have to do you have to cut your bone all along here and spread your palate. So that your back teeth meet in the back, and then you won't have this worry about your front teeth, so I had to have that full on surgery."
7628.0,Patient,Where they have had lost.
126.0,Provider,"My bone I was with Kaiser Kaiser paid for the whole thing. Oh, they had to put a space or bar in the back that my ex had to keep making the push it open and open and open and then I had a big gap right here, and then I had to have braces for the second time, but my teeth all back together. wow oh my God I lost like 20 pounds my whole face was composed lately bruised when I went back to the dentist for a week later, for the follow up they looked at me like. Oh, my God well you're so bruised didn't you drink any cranberry juice. know you guys can tell me to drink any cranberry juice. Oh well, are you drinking protein shakes. No i'm not eating anything I can't even eat I can't put anything in my mouth Oh well, you should be drinking cranberry to help with the bruising and. Protein shakes Oh well, thanks for telling me and then I just about fainted in the in the office and they had to call my mom to come get me I couldn't even drive I hadn't eaten for a week. They never told me anything for aftercare. So my mom went and got some protein shake and cranberry juice and like one little yogurt would last me that would be breakfast lunch and dinner, I could have two bites and then it's."
7628.0,Patient,painful.
126.0,Provider,horrible.
7628.0,Patient,I didn't know they could do something like that.
126.0,Provider,"yeah and the thing was I had already had braces in high school, but they never corrected my bite. My top teeth were were like this and the bottom teeth were like that. So if you're biting down. Trying to choose something in your teeth don't miss. They don't hit each other what you're doing is zigzagging. chewing like this, like in a circle. And that's what I was doing in my bottom teeth are becoming the loops because of that. And that's stupid dentist said everybody can. wiggle the teeth in their mouth, are you out of your mind."
