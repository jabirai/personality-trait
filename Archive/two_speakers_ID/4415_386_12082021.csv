4415.0,Patient,It was saying. To 2121 and joshua reminds. Her fan yeah the. Other thing that you had me muted and videos stop or something model know.
386.0,Provider,"it's something where resume and happens every once in a while and that's, the only way I know how to correct it is by putting. You back in the waiting room and moving you back in which is kind of inconvenient but. It works so it's better than having to log out. And log back in. And, but let's see what we can get done for ya I have you. Just transferred over from the prescription triage department. Requesting for medication renewal for the European or female walk zone, and that is in the strength of the eight milligram over two milligrams sublingual tablet currently taking two tablets sublingual the daily per day is that correct."
4415.0,Patient,Taking two and a half a day.
386.0,Provider,Two and a half per day.
4415.0,Patient,yeah.
386.0,Provider,"So I seen as that that prescription was sent in on 1126 but then, following that prescription there. was a script that with her for two per day. which she tapering you down."
4415.0,Patient,"No it's what has been. A student of news here for two and a half and I had a pre authorization done and it was taking them forever do that so she called me in a script for two a day, just to get me through to the pre authorization went through. Okay. And then, if i'm through and it on Sunday, I picked up my tablets for the two and a."
386.0,Provider,half a day.
4415.0,Patient,"On so like on Friday, or I think Friday or Saturday i'll be out, I think. Okay, and I called him I don't know that I was going to try to log in with Julie know that I couldn't make it your group on Monday, but i've been in compliance with everything you know I mean the whole entire time. The only thing i'm not in compliance with is i'm waiting on my urinalysis test and they keep telling me it's in transit so."
386.0,Provider,"yeah and it's. it's been in transit, since November early November so it's been almost a month. Right now, so there's something going on with the mailing system. Would you um. What I so i'm."
4415.0,Patient,yeah days or something you I.
386.0,Provider,"Honestly, I don't think it's the holidays i'm not too sure exactly what's going on, if it was the holidays and it wouldn't it would have already been there i'm, in my opinion. I have i've had no issues getting mail um but what I would recommend is going down at this point it's been past 45 days and so it's. automatically triggering for you to go down to the lab. um and so, if you can go down to the lab."
4415.0,Patient,We can get a lab order sent over.
386.0,Provider,What lab do you prefer to go to.
4415.0,Patient,I have no idea because i've never had to do it that way you know I mean.
386.0,Provider,"Okay, did you do initial labs. Did you do your initial labs already have a lot, let me take a look here."
4415.0,Patient,"um no, I think I saw no phone letters, or whatever um. I would have to call you guys back to to find out where to go take that you know I mean I don't know the closest one is like. The closest diagnostic West is like an hour away from here, so I know there's gotta be some more closer to me."
386.0,Provider,"yeah I would definitely look it up if it's at quest to, then we can place an order straight through quest and that's easy peasy. Otherwise, when you find a lab but if it's not quest just make sure you get their fax number, so we can fax the order over and then it to be a done deal for you, since you're going to have medication up until. At minimum Friday for you. What what at this one what we would recommend is you go into your individual therapy that you have scheduled tomorrow and then your care group on. Friday and then, once both of those once both of those appointments are attended, we would get a bridge prescription out for you to get you over to Monday."
4415.0,Patient,I got a care group on Friday.
386.0,Provider,"yep I have care group scheduled on Monday, let me take a look here."
4415.0,Patient,yeah I certainly have care like I said I have character on Mondays I know I got an appointment with Stacey on tomorrow.
386.0,Provider,"yep you have an appointment with Stacey tomorrow and then on Friday it's not a normal group it's called a care group, and that is what you're signed up for, and that is, with, let me tell you, who, that is, with."
4415.0,Patient,"yeah hey I think Julie overrode that. or whatever, because I haven't been doing, none of that you know I mean i've been i've been going to group every Monday and stuff that was this is the only Monday I missed. Like on it'll show like that I called and said I maybe couldn't make it but."
386.0,Provider,"I did. I do, I do have notation it was marked out cancelled it's not mark that as a no show its marked out on 12 six it's marked as a canceled as you had to take your mother cheer to a doctor's appointment um. it's really what's really the last know show that I had on file for you was on November 29 and."
4415.0,Patient,"On that yeah I made it, though. yeah because that's when Julie caught him on medication and she let me go early because I was sick."
386.0,Provider,"Okay, and."
4415.0,Patient,"I was feeling good because of my medication so see, let me go early you mean outside of that group."
386.0,Provider,"I would definitely what I would do is I would definitely just talk to Julie, about the no show, because it is marked as a no show. But the only thing really the only thing that's flogging you at this particular moment is that urine drug screening um and there is, there is a few inquiries in here which are messages to the staff here. To just ensure that you need to get need to get that done so, if you can go for sure to individual therapy tomorrow. and confirm with Stacey because the the care group that is that is scheduled on Friday is with Stacey as well um, so I would just confirm with her that you aren't needed to go to that, but then, once we have. Verification that you go to your individual therapy, tomorrow, we should be able to get you a bridge out."
4415.0,Patient,Okay that's fine we'll have to call back and go through all this again.
386.0,Provider,Know Paul message Stacy.
4415.0,Patient,"Okay that's fine and then I know like right now my mom sick as possibly can be she's got like her, and. Her appendix or whatever is messed up so like i'm having problems to where I could get to a urinalysis, but when I talked to I forget who I talked to yesterday he actually looked it up in transit, and he said that it's showing that it is on its way like he looked up the number."
386.0,Provider,"I can pull I can pull up the number two and it does say it's in transit, but my concern is is that it was shipped out. So the print it was printed out the the the printer printed out the order on 1111 and then it was shipped out on 1112 and it was going over it it's being sent over to three to two South ash street in Bethel Ohio. zippo 45106."
4415.0,Patient,"been telling them like. Every time and, like that I haven't been getting it and then that's, all I can tell me as well it's showing that it's in transit it's in transit, and I keep telling them like because usually, when I get that message to my gmail I have it within the next two days."
386.0,Provider,"What I will do is because. it's still. marked as in transit, and I don't want it, I don't want you to have to go on any longer, but what i'll do is i'll send a message over to the higher ups, because i'm just a pee on here but i'll send it up to the higher ups to take a deeper look at it, to see if it's. Either returned or what's going on, because right now. As as we speak, right now, it's still marks out as in transit. with it."
4415.0,Patient,"If they could possibly send me another one out or whatever, I mean i'm like my backs against the wall like getting a ride, I mean it would take me like a schedule without at least a week out, you know i'm saying by Tom I can get a ride to there you see what i'm saying. yeah let me see what."
386.0,Provider,"Again i'm not part of the compliance vc i'm just part of the prescription services, but I will definitely put in a request for a new clap for you. I have no problem doing that."
4415.0,Patient,"And i've been great on your urine test, you know saying i'm not felt one yet."
386.0,Provider,"yeah with with That said, though, typically I mean if you signed paperwork, so you didn't have to go down to the lab and that's neither here nor there but usually technically what usually happens is that you have like your first initial labs and your your analysis done out of lab. But as what I can tell right now is that it has been printed out on 1111 sent out on 1112 and it's still marked is in transit, but I will send a message over to the higher ups to see what they can do to look into this a little bit higher a little bit more. Find out what's going on."
4415.0,Patient,"And we let them know I get sent me a gmail and told me, it should have been delivered that week and I was way before how like before thanksgiving it just never showed up you know Nina just kept telling me it wasn't trying to win I would look up that number. yeah and like I I let them know that, like, I know I can't think in a guy's name I could find out tomorrow and have him also send them a note or. an email and let them know to that I did tell him several times, you know I mean that order man new one, and he just kept telling me, it was in transit, that it should be, because of the holidays and all that I can try and time like no man every time I get that email. i've got festival two days after that every time you mean."
386.0,Provider,"yeah I don't I don't think it's because of the holidays, I think that if."
4415.0,Patient,"It got lost in transit, because, like, I even went to the post office and Dave and call it looked it up and when they talk to I guess i'm wanting to say it's a maybe ups that drops it off, maybe us."
386.0,Provider,"Yes, it's usps. it's the united. States postal service yeah."
4415.0,Patient,"Usually, when he drops it off to me he makes that priority to come to my house, first because he does our street first, and this is in a bigger package so he don't like have to carry it he's on foot you mean."
386.0,Provider,yeah so.
4415.0,Patient,"You and I talked to him, he said he hasn't even seen it so i'm just worried he got lost somewhere in."
386.0,Provider,"Transit yeah that's what it sounds like it's what's going on, but again I I there's no way for me to be able to make that."
4415.0,Patient,"determination, but I can definitely."
386.0,Provider,"I can definitely send a message over to the higher ups to kind of do a little bit of digging for ya. But go to the individual therapy tomorrow talk to Stacy and then I will confirm with Stacey after your appointment that we, we have the authorization to do the bridge okay."
4415.0,Patient,"Okay, yesterday, and I would only need it from I think. I think, from what Friday to Monday. So Monday."
386.0,Provider,So based off of the last script if you said you picked up on what day.
