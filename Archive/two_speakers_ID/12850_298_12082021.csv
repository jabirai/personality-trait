298.0,Provider,"Okay, I just want to make sure there wasn't a side effect going there and. you've probably answered this question before but have you tried propranolol for your anxiety, just as needed."
12850.0,Patient,I don't know what that is.
298.0,Provider,Okay propranolol calms your heart rate down and it calms your blood pressure down when we get excited. And we use it just when we know like we're going to go out driving we know we're going to go places are we know we're going to do a phone call that's going to upset us it doesn't work on the mind as much as it works on calming the body down.
12850.0,Patient,Oh okay i'm not tried that I could try that.
298.0,Provider,"Okay, and so i'm looking at your effects, Sir, and. i'm we're just going to inch it up again and do one effects are 150 milligrams like your regulate like you're taking right now and then we're going to add 37.5 milligrams to that."
12850.0,Patient,"Okay, so it's gonna be like 187 something or other. yeah that's a weird number but sure. Are you going to send it tomorrow morning."

298.0,Provider,If you would like it there that's where.
12850.0,Patient,It says that's that's where yeah that's where i'd like to pick up my medicine.
298.0,Provider,Any suicidal or homicidal thoughts.
12850.0,Patient,"I love the homeless, I love the homicidal thoughts that's really funny."
298.0,Provider,yeah.
12850.0,Patient,"yeah I know I watch a lot of like crime true crime shows and stuff. And it makes me laugh. I don't know how in the world, people can say I don't know it's crazy I don't know how people could kill other people I don't I don't think I could ever get that that about anything to kill anybody else you know."
298.0,Provider,This is where you know what scares me. Is I see the younger generation watching all these things of people killing people and i'm thinking is this going to be like they have no conscience and some.
12850.0,Patient,"Well, we got all these high school killings and it seems like it's every week now someplace right."
298.0,Provider,You know I don't know what's happening in the news.
12850.0,Patient,"Oh well last weekend or last week there was a shooting in Michigan. Really and get this the gun was given to the kid by his parents for Christmas gift. yeah 15 year old kid parents gave him again for Christmas, it was all over their parents, in fact, the good thing about this is the parents are being indicted also because of their negligence and how they treated, you know. guns and things in their household and they were also given warnings in advance by the school that they had found. You know drawings and things of this nature and the kids the parents were even at the principal's office earlier that morning to discuss his behaviors and things that were that were concerning the school. And it looks like he had it with him when he went to those meetings, he had it in his backpack the whole time that they were having these meetings and the mom set some kind of a text him saying honey don't get caught. Whatever. don't get whatever you're doing something don't get caught so that's weird so the parents I didn't need to do that, every time. I think if it, I mean I was a school teacher for however many years, I mean if the if they have we have children. Bringing knives and guns and things to school, I think that needs to be addressed in the home, so I think they need to be held accountable if they can't keep their kids from going to school without having something, and it should be checking your backpack every day. I mean it's crazy right. I mean what what. Parents are being held accountable for this kind of thing and being, you know as much as an accomplice as anything else that I think a lot of this might stop because parents might take an interest in this right. right if there's nothing if you're never held accountable. You know they'll just say the kids having a bad day or whatever, but the. Reality is these things sell them just show up all at once, I mean these kids show indications of problems and mental health issues that aren't being addressed way early on, you know that."
298.0,Provider,mm hmm.
12850.0,Patient,yeah I know that I have a boy that. That oh my God it was a third grader that tried to you know how you for math we have those campuses and things.
298.0,Provider,I mean.
12850.0,Patient,I had to make sure that I had to give them a compass and take it away from them every time because he would try to poke kids with it.
298.0,Provider,i'm like.
12850.0,Patient,"it's like oh my God come on parents. You know this is a problem this kid's been punching and hurting other people all his life, probably in. preschool right."
298.0,Provider,yeah.
12850.0,Patient,"It was all over his report card, you know I mean come on people that at some point parents have to be held accountable, maybe that's, the only thing that's going to make a difference right. When they know they're going to be just as guilty as the child. You know. For the behaviors that they that they do I don't know yeah last week. One edition Michigan i'm like oh my God never stops it's just we're the only country that allows guns, to be in the hands of children. You know in people's homes everywhere in every surface they've got guns everywhere, and they don't expect the kids to pick them up and want to be interested in them or try them or you know come on. Oh well, yeah I don't plan on homicide anybody okay. I don't plan on I don't plan on suiciding anybody either. For that matter, so that's good."
298.0,Provider,"Good good all right, let me know how you do."
12850.0,Patient,"OK, I will thank you for this time I appreciate it."
298.0,Provider,you're welcome.
12850.0,Patient,"Take care Have a nice week, thank you. bye Chantal."
298.0,Provider,"Just a second I thought of something. You can take the propranolol when you know that you're going to have anxiety. But if you jump up. All of a sudden just jump up and you feel a little bit woozy it's because your blood pressure, went low just know, it was the medicine it's not it's not going to be that bad it's just know that you know that is probably."
12850.0,Patient,"So could have an effect on that Okay, so I won't panic about it right."
298.0,Provider,yep.
12850.0,Patient,"that's correct for sharing. Thanks for sharing because that's something that probably wouldn't affect me and I probably wouldn't realize it was the medicine so. Okay, thank you."
298.0,Provider,All right.
12850.0,Patient,bye bye.
298.0,Provider,Take care.
12850.0,Patient,bye bye.
