I guess a little bit of more my speed everybody. honest I guess to a fault like they have their cynical kind of sense of humor to."
724.0,Provider,yeah I figured you'd be a good fit like like they're. Like they're real you know what I mean like in there. Especially with that core group that didn't get it like a long time so they're pretty tight knit so it's a good group I really enjoy it because I like to see how people interact with each other. And they're all super friendly and they'll call each other on their bullshit when it happens or. Right yeah appreciate really good.
13791.0,Patient,"Like my mother in law, help and you know and then one of the guys asked what about your mom and I, like you know that's a whole nother story it's not it's not as clear and clean is not as good as the situation right now right but, when it was good. So I mean you know it just it is what it is black I appreciate the shifting in the asking questions you know, because people I mean. We are kind of going through the same things we just don't realize it until we talk about it, so you know. I would have never mentioned that if they didn't ask that question because for me it's kind of like i'm not gonna say breathe out of the water but. You can't sit here and worry about stuff that you can't control all the time, so at a certain point, we just kind of not let go, but you guys want to do what you do I just can kind of guide you guys know fixing a relationship that I can spend my energy weren't on like I used to."
724.0,Provider,"write yeah. Well, good i'm glad you like it yeah I feel like you're like you're gonna you're gonna be a good fit there so. um oh what's the deal with the with the legal stuff are you getting your you're getting your probation transferred over to California and it looked at at a chance to look."
13791.0,Patient,"But like you said they don't really check up and do too much stuff right, so they came and made contact with me i'm going to say, maybe like 21 days after I got back and kind of checked in with them, which wasn't that fast, of course, right. right person, you may context that they want to be my probation officer as major as well status my residence and stuff like that didn't even come in and search and I asked you guys come in, or anything like that so like Why would. They claimed i'm going to get a new probation officer, I have not heard with it so. It seems like my case is kind of not going to say the back of the line, but I didn't see anybody who's worried about it i'll reach out to our tequila. This is what they gonna do in California, you know just let it go, because all we can do is pants do you pay it by the time April six can you complete your house arrest, you know, for the most part. We can't control how often they drug tisha we can tell you can request a drug test right. I don't think they're really worried about that I serve some time and God, I do like four or five days I pay my bill, so they made money for court right so they're not really I don't really think they're looking into. Things if they are you know i'm taking care of business that hate for me to ruin my chance a diversion of some bullshit right. right they haven't been in my house like I would think they would."
724.0,Provider,"Do you want me to keep just for like see ya like covering your ass scenario, the wanting to keep like a monthly uds for you just. Just in case they don't request it, then that somewhere down the road they're like hey give us your top like you should make it and talk screens and then I got. yeah it's."
13791.0,Patient,"Just in case out appreciate that because, like. The only demand they put on this requirement was that I complete the program right so."
724.0,Provider,"it's like open ended, there is no, there was no way to complete. therapy, other than you would just be like yeah i'm done. Because it's like Level one care it's like. yeah i'm good I don't need this anymore, so there is no like pass or fail, when the program like this we don't have like like a targeted and day that's to be determined by you. that's the thing the Court. The courts like yeah I do six months and you're good or do one year and you're good so."
13791.0,Patient,"i'm glad to call and we judge my worry about that because that's the thing right like for me like even Dr girl bands like they're just in it for marijuana I see no hairline now yeah that's it, you know, so I didn't go into detail about how I ended up in here marijuana right but. Right like we're saying when you guys evaluated me I got placed under Level one kid so it's not like my they sit on my IP right. And it's Kentucky rights when I was talking to the free trial friend, he was like Oh, you know, sometimes I got three days a week, so now this four days a week, sometimes five days a week, and. What the Fuck Is this because, of course, I know I was gonna be getting into. What is do my research, I do my shows lined up with, and you guys, will the first one, we would call back or not, yes and shares, except that it will put you in. person has got a lot of questionnaires all the regulations in basket when I get my schedule of checking out your therapist once every two weeks, the first At first it was a lot of shaking hands like mine. yeah just doing like you know checking my mental state when I was like questionnaires and stuff like that right, but after that it was like one of the group. therapy everyone, no one once every two weeks right your medication help you pass Besides that, I mean you know of course i'm not gonna waste places like that it was. about pre trial officer has nothing to do with my case i'm nothing, do you guys said I should be here, or he would think I beer X amount of time because, like I said it's contestants the cost of doing the testing, you probably are with a serious IP glass like that they might."
724.0,Provider,Probably.
13791.0,Patient,"But I needed the one on one time, and all that anyway So for me, I was like I can knock it out, you know there's often a one on one therapy group session situation like I can utilize it. It wasn't my goal is to eventually sign up for one on one you know eventually sooner than later, so I just kind of pushed into it, I guess, you could say right."
724.0,Provider,"yeah so yeah I mean if they if they give you a condition of like six months or a year, then at least we know what we're like operating from but you know cannabis, you know, like be like that's legal like half the states in this country, you know I mean so it's like. they're on a lot of like long term care that's required now if they're like yeah we want you to learn the error of your ways for for whatever whatever you like alright cool that's what the therapy before."
13791.0,Patient,"Right. Everybody just a little bit different I can say that cannabis is legal and more than half the States, even when I was important. rob bailed out first got there will continue to counseling work, you could have charged you pay 10% Kentucky is like you go to do you pay 100% of whatever. So he gave me a $5,000 bill, you know i'm not the sharpest knife in the drawer I know if I went near posted a $5,000 bill, and they will not stop recording word answer your questions. So I was just that i've been told, like my phone when I call them a girl in the friends, I like look, this was going on. sitting in here for a couple days you know i'm saying i'm a girl see to judge because. I know, whatever build I say it's probably gonna be dropped after and i'm just gonna post bill just because I use my thousand dollar bill pay and like I see where I can tell you $5,000. Is a lot different than $5,000 in California we're at a boss right that's not really shift people involved with. This shit out there it's kind of all right so dealer when I went to court, the next time they lower my bill to like 1000 or $10,000 bill, and I can pay 10% so I paid 1000, then I build out and that was the thing, like the da was like. They wanted to keep my bill what it was, but then even you know my Defense lawyer was like. we're in the middle of you know criminalizing a shit everywhere, including here, you know it's coming it's on our balance, you know, so we really can't do treat it like that anymore. And then the da was, like all right, whatever I don't object in and that's how I got my on lower So when I build out. That was going on the theme glad to public defender because my case was the first series. When I was in court on zoom because zoom calls at this time, you can still ramping i'm in California so maybe maybe keep flying back and forth. There was somebody who did pay like a $5 bill, so they bailed out and they were telling him, I will we don't feel comfortable having a public defender X y&z prep black head, because they were like 5000 feel you can go buy $1,000 500 whatever it is for public Defense time right so. Oh just via it's different after I left for me, I was like I didn't think you can save it so you can't you can't tell somebody what their financial situation is."
724.0,Provider,"Right yeah cuz I mean you could have you could have yeah you know what I mean like a family member could have donated money to you. Good yeah I had to come up with I sold my car for you don't I mean it's like I don't have any more cars so so yeah I don't know if they could. have been clearly that they can because they did they give you a hard time about it, I just find that that's kind of strange right the deny somebody legal preference."
13791.0,Patient,"will definitely little interesting, to say the least haggis. So yeah besides it i've been I got a couple books. The richest man in Babylon a couple of stock books, I guess the basic stats options and stuff like that just want to learn about that I wasn't interested but. starting to pay more attention to what i'm getting about that age 29 like you know rather invest or save some money to go buy a pair of shoes and shot then right. I figured if i'm going to do it, you know, like I said i'd like to do, should the right writers i'm gonna do it i'm going to know what i'm doing I don't have to pay somebody asked me questions, every time thinking about making a move is going to be, you know. My goal is something has to be an hour with the stock on a better turn the news on a 600 want to see what's going out and killing me to do you know. The call someone so a call of course i've been asked him something because he's a he's really big on like he does dividend stocks heavy and stuff like that the older now so. he's trying to handle this aggressive profile, but why he's a good. War bounce it off right just because he's been doing it. Right so."
724.0,Provider,"Oh, do you have like a. You have any any Apps on your phone like like Robin Hood or coinbase or."
13791.0,Patient,"Is that my Robin. Because I like I guess I when I change phones I didn't log in so I was trying to get that back together. Did he just having started each race, so now I have each trade account that's what i've been on for the most part, so."
724.0,Provider,Did I do anything with crypto because that's like all the hotness right now so.
13791.0,Patient,"it's not on there and he's like you know me he's 53 so he's not really fun with it and I. think is a good idea, like a lot of stock per se, I need to do, and people to explain to you in a different manner long time i've seen like bitcoin out like I know you watched you, like me, shoot up for nothing, what it is today, I have a friend with 10 bitcoins. In now he still have these key Brian."
724.0,Provider,"I worked with a with a nurse that had six or eight of them, and I was like if this was like like at the height of the summer and then. When it was worth. A lot I was like she was at this chick is walking around with you know, like 500 K in her pocket and she's. Like I was like and you still work and it's like like I don't understand like like. Wake up some numbers like that i'm just like wow that's. that's crazy that that you're willing to potentially lose out on like that kind of number. On the off chance that it might even get it like higher and it very well might so it's like like this weird thing I was like I probably sold to you know and just. Let the rest ride, you know, like get comfortable like pay off a house or something or do something like like making a huge investment but."
13791.0,Patient,"give it all, but in the go by safer portfolio that would you got a half million dollars, you can buy should rollover make the generation of women at that point so."
724.0,Provider,yeah that's true.
13791.0,Patient,"We just get greedy, and I think everybody doesn't realize that information like I say lot for me if i'm gonna pay really do some I want to pay attention. Understand like what number, I need to get to X amount of dollars, I want to do dividend stocks, you know understand what amount of my needs to be saved. For percentage would we built up a one point so like a big thing I was doing i'm starting to build my for my daughter so talk to me about this numbers put $2,000 in her account for let her roll over you know, so if you keep the q1 compound interest. yeah so you know just stuff like that that think everybody doesn't pay attention to where they don't worry about until it's too late, you know what it's better to be proactive than reactive because. If you wait till it's too late you're not gonna be able to build the portfolio, you went through and you make only X amount of dollars suck on it shut off having fun you're not gonna be able to do what really matters so you know. He was like a Hawk and make it back later I can do this, and I believe you can but understand you know you are going to hit a cap and certain amount of money that you make your life, you know, to make sure she invested in things that will make you more money, so you know."
724.0,Provider,yeah I did all I messed around with a with a dodge coin and a theory of like a like a lot of the crypto because I was like.
13791.0,Patient,"Obviously I missed the dojo and I was mad because. That was so cheap, I was just gonna buy $1,000 or something like Fuck they're talking about it right see what happened, and yet that was a good one that should shout it."
724.0,Provider,"yeah I invested like like real small like not even close to like 1000 but like probably over time, I did, but like I bought in like a decent amount of shares when it was like point 0008 cents, or something like that, or you know, like like a hundreds of other said. And I got like a decent amount of and at one point when it was up to like 75 cents like over the summer I was like oh my God, I think this is kind of kind of crazy and then it's not as crashed and thought like 19 cents, whatever it is, Carl you know what I mean so. All right, but it's it's like one of those things where like you know people are smart and if you're like like long term planning like. Diversity hands on that stuff and like whatever you know if it works out it works, and if it doesn't it's like i'm only out and I took out money, I took out everything that I put into it, I took it out. So, like everything that's in there now is like all profit it's like I don't lose any more. body like I got back what I put into it. So I just play the game like that yeah like coinbase and she Bu EDU you know what I mean like. People go on their crazy and I bought a bunch of that stuff and it's like. same thing with doing it, you know, like it once it starts rolling into like you know the the tenseness sense that. You know potential once that like like a lot of people going to make a decent amount of money, like. You know and that's got Those are the things you kind of gotta jump into just for like play around like there's real no no hopeful this with that stuff built it could be, you know bitcoin was a joke to you when I came out now it's it's a lot of money."
13791.0,Patient,"Right you just got out like he said, like minimize your risk right so like a big thing you see it that I hear is once you made your money back, he got to a certain point, you took it out, because you already did what you're supposed to do right, instead of being too greedy. tested in another avenue and then like to see well, so why. Is this shit hits the main media and everybody starts talking about, it is time to get the Fuck out of batch. In another thing is like people will try and put a lot of money in the water decision I should know that this like fast cool, but the game that we play in everybody needs to realize like it's not. wealth is not built in a day, especially not generational you got to be doing this, you got to get your kids to do this, then they got to get their cases do this and you suddenly get lucky sure it can happen with. i'm not planning or banking on media and let's not put a bunch of money in this shift that could be losing money right so."
724.0,Provider,"Right, you know."
13791.0,Patient,"Just like paying attention looking at Shin, which is, I want to stuff like that you know so."
724.0,Provider,Oh yeah.
13791.0,Patient,"Well, you know the big things i've been working on just a steadying john knock that out, because of course I got some now i'm looking at one Okay, I know I want to do more money and invested. So you know just making sure why this thing is people always say what they're going to do with money, and then, when I get it. And it's even having to me you do exactly what you said you weren't going to do, because you couldn't do it, we were talking about all I never. I never do that, and maybe they'll get the money and it's now, I guess, I could do this one now it's like i'm learning. it's a mental mentality that comes with this ship right to at the same time you got to prepare yourself to know what you gonna do when it comes, so you can stretch it out a coupon for a while huh."
724.0,Provider,yep.
13791.0,Patient,yeah you just just get it.
724.0,Provider,"yeah get it to making more money yeah. yeah it's fun to watch that stuff it's almost it plays on that don't be reward system that we have you know what I mean like a lot of these guys were watching that ticker like all day and like. You know and i'm guilty of it, too, like like again over the summer, like a lot of that crypto. You know that I was messing around with a little bit and be meet all my buddies were all playing like the little crypto game, you know. box here 20 bucks there you know what I mean when we started like noticing stuff like like it really was like that thing, where we were just fixated on it, it was like you know, like maybe you know, maybe, things will happen and then sure, as they are, like everything is like real like."
13791.0,Patient,"We have like a clean my girl, we talk a lot, you know I wasn't. Like you know, of course I just said, what have we before, and this business since one on one and i'm saying a lot of stuff I didn't understand I knew until I started panicking to this i'm like. For me, I used to talk about when he'd be upset he talking about supply and demand, I don't even get that concept i'm like I know i'm doing it, I was like in my mind I don't know what the Fuck you're talking about because. He get upset, of course, because he's like. Come on dude like you know what i'm saying I just don't think he mentioned, we are grasping the concept. yeah okay."
724.0,Provider,"you're doing it already but but there's no title attached to it, so the comprehension is there you're doing it naturally."
13791.0,Patient,"Right so media's like you said just pantages honest I was looking at it, I mean. it's just like a light flicker know what I mean because, like the thing that fucking me as i'm looking into. And I can understand what's going on with it, but i'm not I don't understand at the time that P and ease the beta is like I don't get what that means, but I can look at a stock look at the chart and be like watch the game stuff friends right. Even though they bet against it. I was gonna get a game stock shares, because every time a new system drops okay stop stop will rise up like five or six books like so. Like eight or go to like the 15th So for me, I was like oh minimal risk that should be cool award if I do like 100 200 bucks and see what it is, you know what I can do from here. So, as you know that should skyrocketed because I started best bet against us right AMC I was. wanted to invest in that just because it's like opinion demons for a while and movies, are not open. I understand there's a possibility that might not make it doing it might get shut down that's, what are the benefits that too, but are you knew I was like. When it opens back up people are going to stampede to the movies, and not only that all the steps to getting lucky to get string isn't going to be streamed anymore we're gonna have to move to watch this or wait for you know, some people are going to wait for you know so."
724.0,Provider,"yeah I remember when he was like like for box to box, whatever it was it was like this really. Okay um yeah I I bought mcs stocks do."
13791.0,Patient,"So right, and then you start to thank you crazy because to me it's like I haven't done a whole bunch of research on it right, it sounds like I started the crazy lady, something I don't know. everyone's not buying a stock really it's like you gotta be your research and treasure getting know what's going on, you know you can. Follow the sheep and a half hour heard that to get different results right you gotta kind of really looking to pay attention. So I just stuff like that you know, like six flags didn't go up a lot, but that was something I was looking into to because for us all on partnership so. Again, once we started getting those vaccinations I knew that that was going to happen and the vaccinations That was one thing I didn't I didn't. I didn't know that you can invest know right so now i'm starting to pay attention more one bite out of the news and he was like yeah. Insurance is about to start paying at home covert testing and I gotta I gotta ask that wedding. So that's a someone's about to get money off dishes right like some changes, so I got on my phone and I was like let me see what Darren stock and everybody. And I was just so disappointed myself because. I was talking to Michael about that we just talked about different topics, he was when I asked my What about pharmaceuticals, he was like I mean you can. bet she's real risky unless you know somebody for a company or you know drove there about the truth you're never really got on me like it's a good safety lightsaber out. To somebody like Pfizer a huge company with a whole much avenues to live with the modern and everybody in the Jonathan Jonathan shit we didn't know Madonna was going to get FDA approved and then starts skyrocketed like there right, even when they did. We ever that is a pay attention to show like that I wasn't aware that you can invest in companies like that, because I think common sense a. Little vaccines getting created. This shits about to skyrocket because I hope and people have to get it, you know and and a lot of people aren't talking to send my fans they're like. I don't be paying for that X, Y Z you know that that's what I get you because you thinking about what's coming out of your pocket and a lot of these deals are paid for on a whole nother avenue before it even reaches us so. People know you're not paying for your call the shot right your insurance is paying for it but guess what they're paying the darkness so they're still getting the full price. or whatever they want it is just not coming directly out of your package so you're not thinking of what is Oh, they got a sale, for me, when they actually do in your whole family so."
724.0,Provider,"What they should do you know, to be honest with you because, like you know I paid attention to Congress and all that kind of good stuff and and apparently like if you're a member of Congress you can't be you can't be charged with insider trading."
13791.0,Patient,wow.
724.0,Provider,"Which is crazy right, you would think that's pretty nuts, which is why, like. senators like Nancy Pelosi whose husband has made like hand over fist. You know, with random purchases of stocks and I think you've gone by, and you can look at like the top 10 stocks and that most congresspeople congressmen and women only. And it's like apple Microsoft, you know pharmaceutical companies like it's all of a sudden it's like all of all shares of is."
13791.0,Patient,"always the pharmaceutical companies, I mean. Google I googled because I remember, I was talking about Bill Gates was making a vaccine and now. What vaccine to Bill Gates make it wouldn't say he made anyone, but he invested 20 billion into this shit you got 200 billion right so at the time. Everybody was riding bill gates's as he interviews people to question why is doing this one really. You need to pay attention to what he was doing, because if you were just doing that and invested, including what he was spending all that money everybody would have met made you know damn near 2,000% my fucking increase or whatever you put in here, you know so just stuff like that."
724.0,Provider,"it'd be cool if there was like like a like a spot you could go to just to see what like those people are investing in and be like okay i'm just gonna piggyback on what they're doing because. that's what I mean like so a contract came out over the summer and a lot of people said about it, but so. Most most like senators, you know I mean, I think that the the highest you could make it like the federal law there's like a like a CAP right it's I think it's like. Maybe it's 120,000 maybe it's 100 so whatever it is, but it's below like 200 K like that's like like it's supposed to be like the Max because you're a public service announcement be yes let's get rich right. However, people like Pelosi and like a lot of these old school politicians i've been in a camp for a long time they're worth millions of dollars and not just like yeah I saved every salary and. My husband paid all the House or my wife, no, you know what I mean it. it's not like that it's like they've made exponential sums of money. Very quickly, quicker than they should have. Theoretically right so then it's like where's it come from it's like Oh, they find out that all their spouses are making investments and it's like because they have the inside track so over the summer, I think it was Microsoft. got a Defense contract to be producers for like the next night vision goggles you know it's buried somewhere in their Defense budget. By yourself got it well right before they pass that budget palooza his husband was like he sold off a bunch of his like other stocks and he bought a bunch of Microsoft stocks and like literally flipped like millions of dollars in a day I was just like thank you. So."

She was like no when the company first started doing a lot of law little innocent shipping, to say something like if you're a second generation that's how you know your dad can't miss part of Italy don't pay taxes on grace. So who will be talking about the I mean it's like you can't name somebody right but you're talking about one person like you have to really pay his index crap I didn't know it couldn't get charged for insider trading and all that. But i'm i'm aware that a lot of these laws they make and stuff that are passed somebody gets paid that pay well, but I gotta pay. You gotta you know they call it a donation right to donate to to donate to."
724.0,Provider,shoot in.
13791.0,Patient,"The past and now you're the only person in the field, making beer."
724.0,Provider,"So, like that that do build that that got pushed through I watched politics, a lot actually so that new bill that got pushed through is called the infrastructure bill right and the infrastructure, by definition, is like roads and bridges and stuff that you're going to. put it on essentially of the $1.7 trillion infrastructure budget that they came out with. And originally they wanted like three point something trillion, and they got whittled down and our our national debt to other countries is like crazy right we're never going to pay it back out in our lifetime. And our kids lives if. It were so in that. 10% of that actually goes to infrastructure over like the next 10 years. The rest of it is is like stuff buried within like stacks of documents, so the infrastructure bill comes out it's like this big it's like. Every every member of Congress and Senate are supposed to read that bill every page and see if you like, that shouldn't be there, like, why is that in there. Like the last Defense budget that came out, we sent $20 million over to like Pakistan for like a for kids to learn about like gender studies. And it's like they don't even teach like kids aren't even allowed to go to school and some of these cartoons like, why do we just send over 20 million or $20 million for for what is this got to do with the Defense budget like, why do we spend all this money to Venezuela like. what's that got to do with. Defense budget like like this, a lot of like random stuff that's buried deep deep within these bills and but they presented like Oh, the infrastructure bill, so all these lay people are like oh cool the roads are going to get better. 10% of your roads are gonna get better everything else is going to wherever that money is going wherever that other trillion dollars is going like I don't know but."
13791.0,Patient,"I really way. I hate me, but now it's like."
724.0,Provider,I gotta.
13791.0,Patient,laugh and yeah i'm laughing so we hide.
724.0,Provider,"They hide it like in plain sight, you know what I mean like. I had a list and I follow like certain people like they get out of there like but here's what we found that the bill that we've only been given an hour to vote on. Like we've been just literally had this the bill, now we have to vote out it's like I can't read that fast it's like just the first 10 pages. What is this what is this what is any of this got to do with it, but don't pass it anyways you know it's like Oh well, you know we're in control this time and, like both parties are guilty of it like i'm like i'm a centrist you know what I mean so. I believe, like rational thought process, I mean like do what you want to do as long as it's not infringing on other people's rights like basic stuff and it's like. nope we're in charge today, so we get to make the rules in in eight years, the other party will be a charge and they'll do those rules and make our own rules and they just keep going back and forth."
13791.0,Patient,"Right, I mean. I even hate to say this, I like that shot much rather than a little better, besides just the White House, I can deal with him saying crazy stuff because hey the country. more smoothly, you had a choice, I felt like I was in America and never satisfied came after like trying to make me get a shack X, Y Z and I don't have a choice anymore and it's."
724.0,Provider,"Like the perfect scenario would be you would add a president. who spoke like Obama like Obama was like the best statesman, you could you could ask for well spoken articulate people liked he was he was great a lot of his policies were whatever you know what I mean he wasn't the greatest of all time but. For that presentation was amazing if you had if trump if somebody had like trump's business mindset and obama's political lawyer speak. we'd be untouchable, you know i'd be like you'd be like i'm not gonna mess with this guy like he knows he knows how to talk eloquently, and he knows how to run a country country is essentially a business, you know what I."
13791.0,Patient,"mean like I love the first black President but, as I got when he got an office hours, maybe. 1718 years old. By the time he left like 26 i'm back and i'm like. He didn't really do shit. When I released on looking back special machine and i'm like Oh, we got with medicaid. me this like you say it's just."
724.0,Provider,I don't hesitate.
13791.0,Patient,"For other people like honestly like I know I wasn't the biggest chunk man, but I can do what you say, from our way to stuff is all you're getting results."
724.0,Provider,"yeah yeah we work, I mean technically like like we weren't getting results i'm in the same boat it's just like if I do just kept his mouth shut. Half the time you know the rest of time, people will forgive him when he did open as well, because he was so loose with the lips, all the time it's like all right guys like you don't talk just just do stuff you know, to talk about all time. was his problem, he was like a what they call like a populist. You don't want to be like he fed off of that that ego got the better than most of the time so."
13791.0,Patient,Right definitely so yeah yes. Thank you say this again just go back and forth on a server sounds.
724.0,Provider,"fun to watch sometimes sometimes it's not good for your bank account, but so entertaining."
13791.0,Patient,"I think that's the main important right so. The thing right when trump left, he said it was like because you know he knows when people who's like the country is going to tank watch this would you call your boys and tell them to stop fucking shit. Because one within the stock market for me i'm jumping in at the same time, I will everything is really fucked up. You know, obviously it's just keep you just can't keep track of those like for me i'm like all right, I can grab this whole sale i'm ready to i'm ready to sail but it's like if I was indeed and I hadn't for a long time i'd be pissed right now."
724.0,Provider,"yeah happy crypto crashed hardcore over the weekend again for no apparent reason that we could tell you know what I mean like like all of you could watch all the transit, just like. Just cry and you're like what is going on, while the sun is happening it's like hard to tell and then I looked at all the other stocks that aren't crypto i'm like oh everything's crashing and that's. Right I don't know why. people get to."
13791.0,Patient,Washington stretch much.
724.0,Provider,With.
13791.0,Patient,"me to buy into it right, have you ever heard about these they're like collectibles companies yourself."
724.0,Provider,All the nfc.
13791.0,Patient,"yeah So for me like my friends have been bigger than you know when they called me about it, like I said i'm kind of like you know, I have a set of accounts as i've asked him what so you tell me a company just sold you. A collectible we came and visited test told you, is more of a certain amount of dollars and she's supposed to be worth this you to resell it out of that. yeah yeah and harder now i'm not buying now."
724.0,Provider,"You know I see, so there were a drink Paul he bought it at FT for like like a lot of money and because he's got it like that. right but tons of other people bought into it too and it's like I feel like that only really placate so like like the super wealthy Tom brady's got a. New nfc coming out where it's like all these like memorabilia or something like that, like you know you, you could be the original owner I think here's what I think it is. It might work like a trademark thing so kind of like music right so music isn't physically tangible, but as a musician you could sell your music portfolio. To like a movie studio and then they'll use your your your songs and movies, and every time that needle drops on that record of yours, you get paid. Okay, so maybe that's kind of what is because he's at FT it's like you're going to have access to like his draft car he's got no shirt on and he just looks like a like a like gabi right so. I think so, if you technically all that. Because he owns it and he sold it to you anytime that's used anywhere else you have to use your permission so maybe, like every espn is like hey we want to show the picture on top rated out as draft day, where he looks like a pudgy turd. I think that's how my work, I might be completely wrong, but I feel like that might be how I."
13791.0,Patient,"believe that for certain companies like the time for anyone that makes sense and so that works, I will be intrigued because yeah you start talking about these pictures i'm always wonder."
724.0,Provider,Who has the right to the picture.
13791.0,Patient,"Who are you asked him to use the pictures of like, especially as a whole, whether they're in college or whatever right so right yeah. that's an interesting one, I know the other ones, have been like holding companies, I know me donald's may one which was like i'm not doing that I can go to fucking have. Disney may wanted that kind of was like. almost got me because business right, and I think we were looking at this stuff, it has to pick something with a hardcore fan fanatic back I know Disney has that I know people love this I know people always going to live this right so."
724.0,Provider,yeah I mean it's something that I probably should do a little bit more research on you know pretty sure I can look into. But yeah I feel like there's new ways that people come up with how to make body so. It would make sense to stay on top of it at least marginally and forums. Maybe get lucky. Right yeah I was I bought bitcoin back in the day when it was only like. 1200 bucks that's for sure.
13791.0,Patient,"right here, we look back at it now, but even me I was loud what can I use this as people said it's not cash can't buy anything we can only. Go buy a Lamborghini would and i'm like. i'm not old enough to be worried about hide my waiting to buy a Lamborghini right somebody is useless, for now, like I come back to this later course you can't commit for what it's worth."
724.0,Provider,"It there's also like like like this scheme that like Jeff was running with Amazon it's if you keep all your stocks if all your like your net worth is stock worth. You don't pull it out, you don't pay taxes on your stock ownership. Right. I think that's how people like like you ah Boston bazell is like get around with like owning like or be worth like a billion dollars and they're like but I don't have a bank account, you know what I mean so it's like. They can't be taxed on it, because it's not technically earned income. So I."
13791.0,Patient,"will say that they don't get it or not, understanding, where mindset to talking about our House Center right what is like they have a bank account that's our stock stock county. Just is your bank account that you just shooting where you're investing money and making money versus letting me sit in the bank account in charge of legal dissension coming hmm."
724.0,Provider,No yeah.
13791.0,Patient,"So I mean they say that you love your somebody thinks On Level one he doesn't read to deepen it says you don't blow I don't need a bank account, with no it's not that it's just evolution like you said it's such a different way. If you. can't comprehend their stance to take it yeah."
724.0,Provider,"Which is why, like when ilan he sold a bunch of his tesla stocks recently any any had to because he was about to get taxed on something, and it was like well if I just cut all these taxes out that. By yourself these stocks and i'm not gonna have to pay all those. Taxes so like it was like a clever move, and I think that's what like a lot of like the super early super wealthy kind of view because they know how to work, the game there's a book out. it's called like the tax code or something like that, and you could literally like master the tax code when you do your taxes, like get a bunch of money back and not have to pay anything like you just gotta know how to work, the tax code."
13791.0,Patient,"i'm going. To order them. dad or my reading list because splitting see that my own was Irish retire from irs was like. Right talk about a lot of this when we're doing these days, because you know, according to my age, maybe this is a Bush and like. You know gotta pay taxes or you know about this, you know gotta do that or you could do this and then I go ask him, that you know, most of the irs know you don't have a question. he's like they got sucked in by myself, I need. To make sure with Wesley snipes was like I don't have to pay taxes, like."
724.0,Provider,Oh yeah.
13791.0,Patient,"Right so. everybody thinks, you can get around and pay in taxes, like I don't know what people don't learn, you know what maybe what you're not making a certain amount of money right interviewing. me i'm trying to i'm doing a French bulldogs started to the life and health insurance i'm doing a stock market So for me i'm aiming towards making 200,000 plus year right so with that I have to. Take care of shit the right way or i'm not gonna be able to do what I want to do you know, like a lot of people have like they don't make a certain amount of money because they want to give. A discount tax to claim the key and shit like that right when it's like that's cool, but at the same time Kevin yourself out know like. So if you're doing that you can never do what you need to do to. get a house or our own this or do that or show that proof of income, because you cut yourself short for a discount comic somebody. Just gotta pay attention to make sure, everything is working, I mean is the shortcut work."
724.0,Provider,"Right now. For some, for some people that buy some real hard."
13791.0,Patient,"Right and then it's like you know there's no shortcut up a mountain I mean you take the shortcut to get to the other, metal, on the other side and around right but you're not a shortcut to go up and find so that is different so. You just. Do what you got to get through it."
724.0,Provider,right but. They make a second appointment for you this month.
13791.0,Patient,"No, they didn't make one yet."
724.0,Provider,"Alright, so for the next 90 days. In our own word were small short term goals are going to work on."

I wanted to have my test done by the 14th on the star my new job, and then I wanted to have them and I wanted to invest in lane by black. into January, so I mean that's my next 90 days from we're pretty much they are free to ask now pretty much it mapped it out just because right I don't wanna get too stagnant. And I think it's something when you have a key to kind of changes you right so it's like all my spirit times kind of like. I could be doing some the better, make sure I put you in a better position, so I can enjoy really you know hanging out with you, with you'll be able to talk back we'll be able to actually spend quality time right so.
