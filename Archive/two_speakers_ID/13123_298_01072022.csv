298.0,Provider,I can't hear you. Nothing.
13123.0,Patient,Okay.
298.0,Provider,Now works. How can I help you tonight.
13123.0,Patient,So we're we were talking about trying to difference ssri I think.
298.0,Provider,"Did you have one in mind, or would you like some options."
13123.0,Patient,"I guess i'd like some options, I think, last time we spoke i'd mentioned. paxil but you said no there's a couple others that were thinking up for social anxiety that were better you thought."
298.0,Provider,"You know, for social anxieties zoloft tends to be a good choice. i'm not a huge fan of paxil because of the side of the side effect profile. I really am a fan of Prozac just because of a sense of well being that it gives people who can be irritable and Moody and sad and a whole bunch of a range of motions post Prozac will be good, but so off tends to be a really good one, if you have pain. In your life. As citalopram seems to be good if you tend to be a person who. has problems with side effects lexapro tends to be the choice for that, but for social anxiety that would probably be my order."
13123.0,Patient,Okay well i'll go with your order and try the one that you think is best first.
298.0,Provider,"All right, let's go with the loft it's also called circling and. You start at 25 milligrams remember that when you take serotonin and it can upset your stomach because we have so much serotonin in our stomach and when we have a serotonin medication, it can upset the stomach for a couple days, maybe, but I use such a small dose that I climbed it every. Every week I tried to climb it too, so that you don't feel it so take one tab so take 25 milligrams times one week. And then take 50 milligrams times two weeks take one. Day. To me. too. And then, let me know so that we can climb, to the point that it gets your social anxiety out of the way. um it, you know, some people it causes them to feel more tired and other people that causes them to feel more energy, I want you to kind of play around with it try it at bedtime if it keeps you up then try it in the morning. All right, um it looks like it's time to refill your wellbutrin are we doing that."
13123.0,Patient,"We are, but I don't think I need a refill the quite yet."
298.0,Provider,"Then i'll just let it be until I see you again. All right, thank you for coming to see me James is there any other questions for me."
13123.0,Patient,"that's it, thank you for for being here on Thursday night."
298.0,Provider,Thank you bye bye.
