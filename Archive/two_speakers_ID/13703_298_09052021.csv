298.0,Provider,Hello there.

13703.0,Patient,"um it's been touching go. um I yeah I could I get really bad anxiety, where I get a bad headache actually. And it costs me down."
298.0,Provider,yeah for how long.
13703.0,Patient,"yeah however long I get stressed out i'm the last one was just a way sisters memorial on Saturday, last Saturday, and it was like three days almost like it yeah it kept coming and going, but it was like awful."
298.0,Provider,"Oh, I hear you tension headaches are the worst. They how often. Or how often are you having a panic attack."
13703.0,Patient,Attention headaches headache.
298.0,Provider,Okay attention headache or anxiety or.
13703.0,Patient,"Panic attack yeah I know I guess it could be the same thing well. The little different because, like the the. The stress headaches. I can feel them coming on, and then I get back in a panic attacks it just happens, but um. I don't get panic attacks, very often, but I headaches lately have been. I don't know once a month, maybe, but not, I mean it just it's inconsistent it just depends on what's going on and and if, if I have a high stress. intake and I don't know, for the most part i'm pretty good but i've also was curious to see about possibly trying like an antidepressant or something to. yeah sometimes I just feel like. overwhelmed. And it makes me want to like I don't even know I don't even know what it makes me want to do, I just don't even feel."
298.0,Provider,Have you tried an Anti depressant for anxiety. And the past.
13703.0,Patient,"Along like pie like seven to 10 years ago my mom gave me some Prozac that she had and I tried that for like a month and a half, maybe two months and it worked and I don't know."
298.0,Provider,"I yeah that's what I. would choose for you to is Prozac from everything that i'm reading here. i'm pro fact is a nice choice because it helps with your moods. So it, not only does it help with anxiety, it helps with mood."
13703.0,Patient,So you don't get like. Had know.
298.0,Provider,"exactly that they're the length lessens the sadness. That it's a challenge to find the right spot because we don't want you to not care, but at the same time we don't want you to. You have such high anxiety over it, I noticed that you also have scored really high on here ADHD and so it's. Those kinds of things we need to treat in stages. um so side effects the Prozac are it can upset your stomach because 90% of our serotonin is in our stomachs. So that's one thing that's a bummer about."
13703.0,Patient,trigger another time. That is good that people.
298.0,Provider,Know i'm just telling i'm.
13703.0,Patient,telling you know.
298.0,Provider,"Some people get it, some people don't it's just my responsibility to tell you, if you do have side effects and you do get stomach. Problems it's probably the medication and it's just a matter of it get your body getting used to it if you're one of those people who, who does get side effects from medicines we start low and go slow, so that you don't have those side effects. So that. that's one of the problems with that. And I would rather treat your anxiety, right now, and your possible depression and then treat your ADHD but it's up to you, you need to choose one properly."
13703.0,Patient,"Okay, one out of all three."
298.0,Provider,are no like. I i'm happy to treat you for both anxiety air and ADHD I just can't do it on the same visit because it's hard on your body to start medicine two medicines at one time.
13703.0,Patient,"Okay, so I will go with whatever you recommend. So I that was yeah."
298.0,Provider,"yeah I would love to start you with Prozac and I kinda would like to see you in two weeks and start you on an ADHD medication and, as far as ADHD medications do you have a medication that has worked for you in the past."
13703.0,Patient,um yeah I took adderall and that seemed to work pretty good. Okay yeah. But not like then. For some reason this I like the. not extend or not time release time because I kind of took it as needed.
298.0,Provider,Right I I hear what you're saying the instant release.
13703.0,Patient,"yeah I think that's what I don't know what it was, but it wasn't the time release capsules I know that."
298.0,Provider,"So in two weeks, when I see you again let's look at starting you on adderall if that's okay. Take one pill and i'm starting you at 10 milligrams of Prozac and somewhere between 10 milligrams and 60 milligrams is where people find the relief from the anxiety. But we just you have to keep communicating with me see me and group chat me tell me what's going asked me, you know you know, is it time to go up or tell me your side effects anything like that. Some people. Take Prozac at bedtime because it works better for them other people take it in the morning you kind of have to figure out what works best for you."
13703.0,Patient,I can do that.
298.0,Provider,"Now i'm going to start the outer role, but that does not mean you take the outer all the reason i'm going to put the medication into your prescriptions, is it takes time to get the insurance to pay for it."
13703.0,Patient,that's fine.
298.0,Provider,"So don't take it until we know that the Prozac is on board and you've got my permission to really start taking the outer world okay. Okay, and so let's talk more about sentence at. Some things and you tell me, yes I have that and then give me an example in a tendon do you struggle with an attention."
13703.0,Patient,"and attention. Yes, so i'm not quite sure what that means."
298.0,Provider,You have it struggle paying attention.
13703.0,Patient,"When people are talking paying attention um. um it depends. not always I mean it just depends on what it what's going on, I mean sometimes i'm totally looking at them and even replying but i'm not even listening at all. So, but a lot of times I mean I I do can pay attention. I know how to pay attention i'm painting it and you know. But."
298.0,Provider,to struggle with disorganization.
13703.0,Patient,"Yes, sometimes i'm like a roller coaster I don't know i'm. I can organize things but. If i'm in a good if i'm happy, then everything stays that way, and then, if I get all stressed out and. depressed then everything kind of. Just falls apart, but um. I don't know if that makes any sense. i'm very emotional."
298.0,Provider,You have problems. finishing tasks.
13703.0,Patient,"and Sometimes, because I have so many going that it's like hard to keep. Like instead of. finishing one because it just is convenient to start this other project like you know I have like a venture proposals going, and I really should try to get one finished before I continue attack another one and I don't know so sometimes I have too much going. But. But I do meet tasks, eventually, I always get it done eventually."
298.0,Provider,You fetch it.
13703.0,Patient,"A little bit just just depends. On I don't get like non stop. For sure, but."
298.0,Provider,Are you forgetful.
13703.0,Patient,"um well apparently. Every now and again, but I still have a really good memory like I can always find everything I remember exactly where I put it, but sometimes if I have a lot going on, I can space things and but not very often. Okay yeah."
298.0,Provider,Why do you think you might have ADHD.
13703.0,Patient,"I don't know this because I was diagnosed with it, when I was like 19."
298.0,Provider,Do you think you have it right now.
13703.0,Patient,um. I.
298.0,Provider,put you on the spot didn't I.
13703.0,Patient,"I know i'm like I don't know I. I feel like I know that when I did take the medicine it helped a lot like as far as completing tasks and in school. And like you know with my proposals at work and, like stuff like that, like I could it seemed like I was did 110% better like got things. finished things without starting other projects, I don't know yeah it was way more organized for sure I mean it definitely helped and I don't know why that is, of course, you want to be just perfect and not have to take anything really but. But. yeah I think at this point in my life just maybe for like a little bit. Until I can get I don't know. My life together a little bit i'm kind of in shambles right now."
298.0,Provider,"Okay, do you still have legal issues going on."
13703.0,Patient,"me yes i've legal issues or no House no car my kids are in school and i'm um yeah I mean i'm living in a lodge but it's not like permanent and it's it's kind of yeah again because after if cook as guests come, then we have to find somewhere else to stay and it's like doesn't work really."
298.0,Provider,"Right it's hard Okay, well, I will see you, then, would you make an appointment to see me and two to three weeks to follow up on this medicine and. Let me know when group how it's working for you the process. Okay, all right you're good to go any suicidal or homicidal thoughts."
