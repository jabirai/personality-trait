6344.0,Patient,"than that. that's how my week my week has been just like mine, oh."
298.0,Provider,"So here's my thoughts. Mano is not great it's not great at all, but it is when we look at people who cycle and go around Mano is. A part of the process as we're medicating to wear when you cross over that over to moto then we start going down on the meds again hopefully that's why we are so I don't mind if you'd be bland for another week or two, even though it's not fun it's better than the alternative. that's where my thought is it's not fun and i'm sorry I wish I could make it better."
6344.0,Patient,Okay well good.
298.0,Provider,We will get there. What do you think is the cause of the the mono ness.

298.0,Provider,uh huh.
6344.0,Patient,quiet about it.
298.0,Provider,But you're not it's fear not actual irritability.
6344.0,Patient,"i'm right, I mean at work, I have to talk and do what I need to do there's a little bit at your ability at work, but that's just normal um but other than that right, yes. just keep going."
