724.0,Provider,transcription is going to meet with Joseph he's not checked into the virtual clinic but he is in the waiting room. hey what's going on.
8710.0,Patient,friggin. up and friggin brookings again.
724.0,Provider,Nice.
8710.0,Patient,yeah.
724.0,Provider,Out there all week.
8710.0,Patient,"Now. Unfortunately. My schedule is working shed it's like a I tell up here on Sunday night I stay on Monday and then i'll leave Tuesday like just to be able to make it back in time, for they get back in time for like this box and group and shit. Over can. I thought about just like chillin here and doing this box and group here tomorrow and I was like man I don't really want to drive back in this dark, especially if the weather gets all shitty again. Yesterday it was bad man. It was just like I had a certain spot like. Luckily, it was not too far from here, but it was like. Probably like 10 miles out of crescent city like it just the sky just friggin opened up now, and it was like very little visibility and. Plus like it was like windy roads and shit and like for somebody wants to ride like two inches behind my bumper and shit frickin it was just crazy, it was like really little visibility, so I was like damn man and."
724.0,Provider,Was it was it rain or snow.
8710.0,Patient,"It was just it was just really hard rain. I had big signs saying like to carry chains through that area, which I. didn't even think about you know, but like Luckily, there was no ice or anything is this is drove slow and."
724.0,Provider,Sam.
8710.0,Patient,made it all good.
724.0,Provider,"yeah that is a it's frustrating now people people tend to forget how the drive to inclement weather for some odd reason like they're never experienced it before, but he wants to be. Either super aggressive or super cautious, to the point of like irritability like that they put people at risk with like their. With their costs and sometimes. yeah yeah it's frustrating."
8710.0,Patient,"yeah so yeah and I laughed about to because it's always the same situation it's like the guy in front of us being way to extra cautious driving too slow and the guy behind us being held aggressive so it's like. 1.8 is pulled over and let like all these cars roll by and shit and I was, like all right now, or can drive my PIC."
724.0,Provider,yeah it's it's frustrating but bit out of there so that's that's the positive.
8710.0,Patient,"hell yeah man, we can. actually got to one point when it was like. I know, like I say I had to pull over just for a little bit just kind of like. Like I don't know like try to like. almost like trying to reassess my night vision or whatever, because it was raining so hard you know, and it was just like damn man like it was really hard to see, like everything was just a blur and shift so. yeah that's."
724.0,Provider,"A good one I I know it sounds like counterproductive, but. For like night vision, it takes 30 minutes to. To react made so like if you stand outside as it got Dr your eyes would adjust with it right, but then. The second one side you're like oh Okay, it takes about 30 minutes for your eyes to now adjust to that. So, like when you're driving at night, like literally you'd be like you're dialed in you feel pretty good and then like oncoming car why the high beam you or just depending if they have like those white lights that's enough to screw your your. Your vision so then it's going to take about 30 minutes readjustment constantly happening your brain is constantly like. Trying to adjust that it causes like impairments, to try to like preserve like when, if you see like a car coming, and you can see it's headlights like. A good distance away like a white light of. Those blue lights like cover one eye because you'll be able to preserve your night vision, a little bit better."
8710.0,Patient,good idea.
724.0,Provider,"stuff that we were taught, you know."
8710.0,Patient,that's a really good idea i'll definitely i'll do that on the way home. yeah.
724.0,Provider,"I think so, whatever. Your, whatever your topic that I is you know. you're going to want to preserve that one because I want to take sober and it will compensate for the week or the two wise because you'll have. Both Iser fruition like pretty normal but. you'll have dominant eyes right so. If you hold up like if you hold your hands out like like a diamond at full extension. And just find something in your House like, on the other side of the room, like a light switch."
8710.0,Patient,You know.
724.0,Provider,"Put that light switch in the middle. Of the diamond and then naturally just closed one if you're right handed. Most people will have to. close their left side, which means that the right eyes are dominant I. It as long as it stays in the middle that you're good to go right. Sometimes it will shift over which means that you're actually crossed dominant across dominant so i'm right handed about lifetime dominance so like when I do that that like that technique i'll put something in the middle. Both eyes or opens and i'll focus on it and i'll just close what i'd actually I close my right I. Think stays dead smack in the middle, but if I close my left, I have to think shifts over to my right."
8710.0,Patient,Oh.
724.0,Provider,"My hand out so like I know that my left is my daughter, and I saw a prompt driving. Like i'll see a car company i'll just like close my left I preserve it and as it passes all i'll open it back up."
8710.0,Patient,that's a good idea.
724.0,Provider,It helps a little bit.
8710.0,Patient,I am a test to see. Like after I get up here i'm gonna be like testing to see which ones.
724.0,Provider,"You know, we would do that with like a like like i'm like a licensed firearm instructor and I haven't taught like a lesson i'm like over a year, but. One of the first things you want to do is. Is figure out which I dominant you are it's like one of the first things I do with people because. You know, for me, when I was learning to shoot I just assumed that I was right, I dominate and i'll always hit you know right, so I would always hit. To the left, if that makes sense. Because it's like opposite of so it might structures were just like yeah just a little bit to the right, so I picked the target and. aims, a slightly right of it and i'd hit it, but it wasn't great you know I always shot well enough to like get by and then like adjusted my sites to where like if I picked up, and it would be pretty dialed in on. It wasn't until like a couple years into my service at a buddy of mine, he was like. This dude from New Orleans. And he was a combat arms instructor. And he had a gangbanger to like in New Orleans he was like with the crips and. stuff so I took his advice for sure he knew how to shoot. And he was he said he's like my man's you might be left eye dominant and I was like I didn't know what you're saying, right now, and he was like do that you know I mean like you do. That technique both eyes open find something like a good distance away, you know. Put in the middle and then just close one eye and I just I naturally close my right eye. And he's like he's like you're letting your left eye dominant my man's he's like so like when you're aiming downsides like. An automated like you got to use your left eye to do it and it made sense and then like after that I shot like really well progressively got better you know what pistols and stuff like that stuff that had like front sites. Right yeah i'm like a rifle Do you still like I can't. I kind of like look over it with my left is still had to like like I just like my rear aperture to move over. It so we compensate and eventually like I got knowing that like I like be able to dial it in so, but if somebody else picked up my rifle and tried to shoot it, they would have been shooting like far right like what the hell, but. For me, it was. It was it was on so. yep preserve the one is the most important thing you do at nighttime driving."
8710.0,Patient,"that's actually dude that's really cool I didn't I never even thought about that, before like that's crazy oh shit i'm gonna have to test that too, because, like, I wonder if I. wonder if, like that would work with like shooting and shit because, like, I mean i'm I shoot pretty good, but like sometimes yeah sometimes it's often left and like maybe it maybe it's not my sites, all the time, maybe it is maybe i'm with."
724.0,Provider,"You know, a call like cross eyed dumb it."
8710.0,Patient,that's crazy. yep oh hell yeah.
724.0,Provider,"it's an easy fix. You know what I mean it's it's literally, the first thing I would I would do people i'd like you know. One hand they're usually like right or left i'm like none of that matters you know I mean something it was like. let's do the test, you know we'd pick like a light switch or something like that and have them do and and people like oh my God. And you could see you could you could see what i'm talking about being cross eyed because, like if you are right hand right I then. it's not going to change, but like do it again and then close your right eye and you'll see that the like the target will shift and start hiding behind like your left hand. You know and that's what it does, for me, because i'm right I dominate."
8710.0,Patient,My right hand. So I.
724.0,Provider,"Just slightly shifts over I don't know what the bro science is like, why does that it just those."
8710.0,Patient,that's weird that's cool though good definitely a test out.
724.0,Provider,yep yeah. It allowed me to be like me dexterous like I can do both I can shoot with both hands on. I can do a lot with like my left hand. So so.
8710.0,Patient,"I always say my. My left hand is retarded man freakin like. Like figure out how would like me, let me and my buddies were switching hands off when we're shooting decibels wants, and it was like. Like I I realized just how like how weak my left for an index finger was you know because there's one of the harder triggers to fully you know, like the heavy writers. it's kind of crazy like how actually extra hard, I had to work, just to be able to pull the trigger on the left hand and."
724.0,Provider,"Well, it goes against like a lot like. It kind of goes against like a lot. of you know kind of what like what we were taught it's like hold something pretty tight you don't want to like be like white knuckling it, but you want to hold it pretty tight and you're like okay cool I got like a nice firm grip on whatever baseball BAT whatever it is it's like."
8710.0,Patient,cool.
724.0,Provider,Now release your index finger from that grip you're like oh now you're like you're only gripping something with like these three fingers and you wrap around with your thumb so it's like.
8710.0,Patient,Oh you're not a strong.
724.0,Provider,"Like naturally so then it's like now go against that motion so like you're tightening really, really hard them. Really soft. It consistent, you know, to me it just goes against like the natural physics of your hand."
8710.0,Patient,"You know, hold something really."
724.0,Provider,Please very gently what you're you know it takes like a lot of like time like train that condition and if you're never do what your left hand you like a.
8710.0,Patient,straight up.
724.0,Provider,"Like playing video games, you know to be you kind of get away with it like your weekend there's always gonna be a little bit sloppy or but it's like. it's one of those things into practice with."
8710.0,Patient,"Oh yeah. i'm gonna freakin idea need practice more on the left hand me my buddy we're doing like the whole dual wielding shit you know we're just fucking around you know, two pistols with Batman Batman like it was just. yeah. Now, every time you know yeah it's like the the right mag always emptied way faster than the Left mag and frickin then plus you know doing it like that it's like barely hit new things."
724.0,Provider,"Right yeah I mean it's it's not a bad form like like if you if you try to be you know competent like you would spend some time on your weak side because, like. Like real practices like say you're right on his damage is like all of a sudden. You got no training on your left side that goes for everything kind of like writing a little bit how to throw a Punch you eat you know. Little by little like instead of eating what your right hand like your left hand and kind of just train that coordination, you know I mean like it's not it's not a bad thing to do, for. You know, beyond just. You know target practice and stuff like that. Because you can train up with easy like it like the brains capable of learning new things fairly quickly and it's just. muscle in mind connection and eventually you'll be pretty good like. Switching back and forth."
8710.0,Patient,"yeah i'm gonna have to start doing that because, like frickin I do like. I know it's like practically sit on my damn left hand if i'm like eating or whatever writing or."
724.0,Provider,Do.
8710.0,Patient,"I always have that like we always have this like weird conversations yeah me and my buddies be getting stoned or whatever it's like dude like what would you do if you had like. If you lost your fucking right arm, you know and like how how much would that suck having to like try to relearn how to do everything just your left arm."
724.0,Provider,"learning curve, will be a lot easier to. Practice early. Right, I mean, obviously, the goal is not to not to lose it or be injured but like. You know, things happen right, I mean it would be bad to be multifunctional."
8710.0,Patient,"Yes, true yeah happens all the time."
724.0,Provider,"yeah for sure. So you're you're up there for a few days. you're going to try to go back to the holiday, are you is this like your holiday visit."
8710.0,Patient,"kinda like the holiday visit is i'm going to be working on like Christmas Eve and Christmas and. Okay, I mean I might make another trip over like after Christmas like when my next weekend is I might make another trip up here but i'm not i'm not entirely sure if i'm going to be a little afford it."
724.0,Provider,"Did you like volunteer to work, the holidays for extra."
8710.0,Patient,"know that I just I already had a schedule, but again, but I still take the extra money like."
724.0,Provider,"yeah for sure. yeah sometimes like like they they incentivize you to pick up the holidays and then. You know, some hospitals will have like. Like a holiday be holiday where it's like whoever decided at some point, like you, work, like every other so like like the people work every holiday. You know who were Christmas and you're guaranteed Christmas off next year and, like. that's how it would like flip flop, I guess it made it easier for like managers and know who we're going to be on. To be off based on like."
8710.0,Patient,"Their holiday. i'm like kind of low guy on the totem pole there so it's like I mean. I don't know like I friggin. Honestly it's like since I don't really have like. me I don't really do much in Eureka like I don't really know like I don't really know so many places or things to do there and plus with the whole you know, everybody freaking out about covert it's like there's. not really many things to do so it's like. You know, usually even if my boss tells me and my weekends, or whatever i'm just like yeah whatever work, you know, like. I mean it gets getting a little whack because, like that guy Stanley there man he just like. Like they hired a new guy finally that makes it a little bit easier because I think it's like. I think that's going to be stanley's like replacement hopefully."
724.0,Provider,And this is a kid That was a. Pretty unreliable and then.
8710.0,Patient,"Oh yeah and he's like he's, not even a kid either that's the worst part is like he's like I mean this guy's like you know 50 freakin years old, but he acts like he acts like he's like 50 and you know he's like. Like he tries to he tries to do the whole like talk about drugs like it's cool and like. Like the dude was fucking really trying hard to get lucky he went slipped something in my frickin sweater pocket my hoodie pocket. And I pulled it out loud talker tried to give me like it was like like 10 percocet or something like that, and I was just like what the Fuck are you doing dude like. I was like you know I just I told you that, like you know i'm clean i'm done that's it like and he's like oh come on man like friggin seriously like you know. you're I know you're very good why just take some like I said I was like no actually I don't anymore like. I don't even want to do that shit and frickin us like that's why I frickin I take you know suboxone and shit like that is like he just I think it's one of those things like you know the misery loves company like because. What."
724.0,Provider,"She could be looking to see if he can like this suede somebody like it's like one of those things where it's. at work on somebody who's got one belief system. Right and they're like now never do that i'll never do that, and you bug them enough and then one day they break and you're like. Oh shit that's not even. You billy I didn't really want to do that, you know, I just wanted to see if you would agree to doing it like that's like half the fun, for some people, is just like. To see if they could you know screw your value system up you know by you know beating you down, taking advantage of like a situation long enough, and people like that man they're they're toxic."
8710.0,Patient,Oh yeah.
724.0,Provider,"i'm saying it's a reflection on them and stuff that they're dealing with like that's always the easy scapegoat know broken people try to break people. But it doesn't excuse the behavior because, like rationality would be like you know I told you, once that. i'm trying to get my. My life in order I don't like doing that type of stuff or whatever it is, you know pick your poison and if they want to continue the fruit like to be persistent about it, like. This something clearly wrong, you know what your thought process, and you know. Whatever your moral compass, whatever it is, but. You don't need to get your shit together and then kind of tighten up and if you're not going to do that, then we're gonna have problems right so."
8710.0,Patient,"People like that. Like I had to explain it to them like a surgeon and. he's just ridiculous about like all that shit like what. With drugs or drinking even like some of the things that he says about like the women they're like trying to like. You know I can understand, like, I can talk with the guys any day you know about like oh yeah like Fuck or whatever you know stupid shit like that, but like. This guy gets into some fucking like twisted graphics sometimes and i'm like bro like I was not raised like that it's like don't even fucking like don't even fucking talk to me about that shit again like. Because he'll be saying it like very loud wow like one of the you know 18 year old girls from adult day health care is in the kitchen and shit. And like i'll just push them motherfucker away from me, I was like dude i'm not going to be involved in this conversation i'm not going to fucking get busted for this shit you know, like."
724.0,Provider,Right.
8710.0,Patient,"I mean it's it's pretty disgusting sometimes then. yesterday. I mean, I think it like pissed him off it like that's kind of what I was going for it because he was like. Trying to do the cool thing with the drugs again and, finally, like I looked at him I was like you know dude I was like usually, when I talk about my drug past is like it's just me like remembering how fucking pathetic I was back then. Was you know and frickin he just like. Will. Whatever and he's like freakin you know I don't do drugs anymore, and I was like yeah i'm sure you don't like again. You just kind of stopped talking to me after that I was like okay good. work."
724.0,Provider,"yeah that's that's one way to establish a like a position on things. You know, without being like. You know super over but. Yet, something that needs to be said, obviously, like like that Dudes behaviors know it's uncalled for and it's just a matter of time before he gets caught up in some HR situations and your best to just keep your your distance because either you get affected. directly or indirectly, if I say like indirectly somebody's going to call you cited to like Have you ever witnessed. him saying this type of stuff and you're like Jesus like I didn't want like I don't want any part of this, or you know what I mean so like people like that are. You know their cancers in the workplace, so just do your best to be like you know I just I keep my distance I ignore what he says, half the time you know I can certainly. Work related anything that's not you know specific the work I don't engage with i'm just talking about so. yeah safer that way, if not people like that will know when their ships are saying they're going to look for ways to like throw people overboard and like save themselves, whatever it is so. avoid that guy at all costs, you know listens professional and nature does."
8710.0,Patient,"yeah and that's what that's kind of what I have to do now, because, like. I mean have, I have to engage with them in a lot of the shit now because, like one of the things that I don't understand how like somebody can. Like I don't know this is gonna sound like rude but it's like I don't understand how somebody can be like that stupid sometimes because he, like you know we have color code on the coffee stuff that. We have a color codes on the coffee cups it's like a regular copies and a blue decaf copies and, like the red. And then we put like hot water for tea and like either a black or Gray coffee cup and that's where like trey line you know, like to feed the patient ship dude that guy has screwed it up every fucking time and, like do it like, and I mean every single fucking time. And then he, like doesn't say anything until like the last minute, like. Like we've already you know stack like a trays and the fucking part and then they're like one of the diet, as will be like Stanley did you like. Did you really like just put fucking regular coffee and the fucking red cup and tea and the blue cup knowledge she's like oh oh yeah yeah yeah I did sorry I forgot it's like dude. Like and he's been working there longer than I have you know it's like any always he tried to tell me like oh dude I don't know like some day some days I just walk in here and everything everything just seems so new. And like I tried to tell him I was like dude you might want to go get a fucking brain scan or something like that could actually be like a neurological problem you know, like frickin. And he's just all like oh I don't know I mean like. I seem to get by and i'm like dude like that I could literally be like dangerous situation you know, like you. You could have something wrong with your brain to where you just don't remember shit or everything changes tomorrow and it's like. You know it's like or if that doesn't work as like maybe stop buck and shooting up so much goddamn math and snort and so much percocet you probably be fine you know. Like side, I have never forgot shit that much unless I was like when I was a heavy and my Matthews, then i'd forget like i'd be mid conversation completely forget what the Fuck I was saying, is my."
724.0,Provider,"attention span is. No, it isn't focused on that, like your short term working memory is you know spawn out make sense."
8710.0,Patient,"yeah and I should sock man I hate it like i'm glad I got my like my mind back you know i've actually fucking like I actually have a pretty much you know halfway fluffing control over what i'm thinking you know. But I don't know I mean like it's like I try not to. I try not to be like judgmental or like shun people or anything just because, like yeah i've been there before and it's it's hard and it sucks but like then there's those certain group of people, but it's just like dude like. Like I just don't have fucking time for you anymore, like, I mean there's a couple of guys that I went to rehab with that, like yeah I still consider them my my friends like pretty good friends, you know, but like. they've just gotten so out of control, with their relapse and shit like I don't even really talk to them anymore like I. You know they'll text me once in a great while but it's literally the same thing you know it's always a good dude yeah I have to pay $500 left on a car and. You know, I was hoping that maybe you can help me out with that i'm like not good. i'm trying to get my own place I can't be I can't just be lending $500 out to somebody who might know is going to just disappear when they say that they're supposed to pay me back know like i've been dealing with that with fucking will for. over a year now, like, I mean, and he asked me frickin last week, he asked me three times and the week for first was $500 that was $300 and then last day he asked if I wanted to go get some food. I was like yeah sure whatever dude you know, and he came and picked me up and we drove in and out burger He ordered I ordered and then he was like oh. yeah dude like. I didn't have any money and forgot to say that i'm like. Whatever dude all by this time, but you know because he's bought me food before whatever so like I got that but. I paid with my card you seen the hundred dollar bill on my wallet and he was like immediately yeah dude like so I got like $100 left I gotta pay on this car. And I was hoping like you know, and I was like no dude it's like this hundred dollars getting me to brookings and back you know and."
724.0,Provider,"yeah they are. yeah this clearly, like others, other priorities still going on it's still like. You know that's still like a behavior issue you know I mean to me when when people talk about. Or, like the title of attic I never really think of like like the chemical dependency part because most of the people that I talked to or. actively pursuing you know correcting that pattern right, you know through medication through therapy all that kind of stuff, but when people are doing stuff like that that's where like the term attic sits with me because I always thought it was more of a behavioral. Definition versus a you know, like like a clinical definition of. So to me when people go to advocate like. for whatever reason, my brain, just like defaults to like nefarious behavior and I was like like I don't like it when people like do that because if i'm having a conversation with you. there's a good chance that you're not up to like that. That nefarious behavior anymore, or if it is it's very. minimal, at best, you know you're not into like. manipulating your family your friends your employer you're not out trying to like lie cheat and steal like to be that's all like it's all like the traits of like. An addicted behavioral. pattern that people have when they're in the throes of addiction right and that throws the dependency. So, to me, when you say that just. tells me that that person still. he's still on the outskirts of like getting clean he's not even close. To be."
8710.0,Patient,Is that like.
724.0,Provider,"he's not like you. know what I mean it's not like he's a knowledge issue is seeking out efforts to change it. asking for help, trying to do the right thing he's still like in that position where he's like. Trying to manipulate you into like giving him money, and you know as well as I know that if you gave it through 200 bucks. It wasn't going to go to his car. You know what I mean so. You know to be that that's like that's the behavior of somebody who's still struggling with. Like a little. bit like dependency it's best to. not enable that behavior so like if he's calling you. it's because he wants something it's not because he wants to shoot the shit out. Be body body makes sense."
8710.0,Patient,"Oh yeah and it's it's sad too because, like frickin. Like me, and will actually became really we can like actually really close you know, the first time we're in rehab together and, but we also had we were blocked from the get go because me and him both has a mindset like. Oh, I know i'm going to use one more time, at least in my life, so I mean they already screwed ourselves right there, and like we both read ups together and. Put like he went back to crossroads two weeks later, and I came back to brookings and just tried to do the whole like oh i'm just going to do it on my own ship and. Then I eventually admitted defeat and went back to rehab and when I went back like will was fine you know, he was sober he had a good job and. Then it was like a month after into rehab he said he relapsed and it was literally because his roommate left town, and it was like he always has that mentality of oh nobody's looking I can get away with it and. Like a couple days ago, when he called me about the money, like the first thing he said he did was he he quit his job. And I was like why in the fucking world did you do that, did you have you have grant you have bills, I mean like what like what made you decide to do that, it was because. They didn't sell a car to them and i'm like dude that's not a that's not a legit reason to quit your job and. Then it was like right afterwards, he asked me for a fucking $500 and I was like nah and he keeps on saying the like. No i'm going to go to you know I mean they're going to go reading and go to my mom's house, which you know that's like were. Those were like his old stomping grounds, anyway, so it was like you're not going to go to your mom's house to get clean you're going to go down there and run a muck and. or he's going to go to waterfront fucking detox place he's like yeah just me I just need like a week and waterfront i'm good and i'm like dude you went through to 90 day programs, and like. That that didn't do it for you, you know you you like already we're trying to like when he got out of a second 90 day program he was already trying to like set himself up by because he got out in like a. mean it was like frickin."
724.0,Provider,"tell you, your volume dropped."
8710.0,Patient,"Oh, I got a you know I got a beginning of the year, coming up because cluster they said after your second time you gotta wait you gotta wait till next year if you Fuck up again before you get another bed, and he was like Oh well.

8710.0,Patient,"yeah I was just reviewing it was bad he just. He just always has that mentality of like you know Oh, I can just always go back to crossroads and they'll just. You know they'll just take me back in and stuff and. Like that's not the case, you know, like he kept on using that as a crutch and I know crossroads is finally had enough because I mean there was a guy named Jerry there that went back six fucking separate times. And it's like. They just always use for Oh, but it's wintertime it's cold. i'm going to get a bed for a couple months, then get up Fuck up you know and some afraid like wills, like a lifer so I just spent a like after getting some of my shift stolen from me by him, and you know $2,000 later i'm just like new book and done with that ship."
724.0,Provider,"yeah I think they call those. You know, and like the insurance world. hi utilizes and oftentimes they'll get like denied for those types of services, though, that they could never get the nod like like a. Like emergency services like when I worked in the hospital, we have like your guides that you knew were like. High utilizes that they were just coming into the unit, because they were they needed a place to crash, they need their free meals so like the like Ms picks up you know they call 911 they're like yep. You know I feel like myself, you know it's it's Friday night and it's raining outside and we know that they're homeless or whatever, the situation is and they come in and we would see him pull up to our one on the stretcher and you just you get really frustrated with. You know, like like."
8710.0,Patient,The.
724.0,Provider,"Like the decorum and you're just like. Literally call 911 you know what I mean you, you occupied these first responders time because you wanted. A free meal and a hotbed and you're gonna come into the unit and you won't be here all weekend because it's Friday night we're not going to find anywhere, for you to go. You know, you know, during that time for higher level of care or you know this is like acute care because you said you were to hurt yourself, now we really have to wait until Monday, Tuesday. To get you out you're just going to come in here, and you are start fistfights and you're going to be an animal and you're gonna you're going to bother if every single one of the employees in here going to make the staff on call tool and it's like you would just see it and. Get frustrated you're just like can't believe that that we tolerate those, but they are high utilizes and you know, for whatever reason, you know they're too far gone to really get. Back on the horse because it's just. they've enabled that behavior for so long, but. You know programs are like crossroads, they have like they have the choice to be like. No, no we're not going to keep doing this, you know what I mean like they don't have to render that care because it's not an emergency. yeah and i've worked at places where there are people like this your repeat offenders and you're just like How long do you do you continue to like enable the behavior you know you want to help people. Obviously that's the goal that's why everybody gets into it right, but it's like at some point is like a law of diminishing returns you're like. Like they don't really want it like you're going to work way harder than they are. And it's it's diminishing returns, you know, and at that point you're enabling a certain type of behavior and every time you agree to. You don't you just reinforcing that for them it's like it, so you got to draw a line in the sand that like sorry man like go someplace else you know prove that you could do it, you know we want six bonds, who want all this stuff it's like. you'll know when you're ready, you know I mean people are."
8710.0,Patient,You can't force people to being ready like they know.
724.0,Provider,"Like they can come around to it, they have their like their catalyst and their their moment of clarity and then that's it you don't have it, and then after that says. You know, working in the process that's the hardcore coming to the conclusion, at some point happens, whether or not you're thinking about it or not. sticking to that that's the hard part."
8710.0,Patient,"yeah and that's that's actually what I explained to a guy. This. he's kind of like the you know he's like an enemy put a friend at same time like you know we hang out and do drugs together and ship it like I was always looking over my shoulder to make sure he didn't rob me. is one of those stupid things I just I knew him for a long time, and he, like the actually to be a good guy but. Like he lives in brookings but like do that fucker like. He kind of like through something that make us really pissed me off to like is a when I first got into or first got out of crossroads. And went to a sober living house and. He like hit me up and was like Oh, how you doing and I was like i'm actually doing pretty damn good right now, you know I graduated program and i'm like actually you know working to fucking get my life back together and. You just pulled up oh yeah well you know I wish I could just fucking have somebody fucking rescue me and take me to fucking rehab and then just you know, give me whatever I fucking needed when I needed it. Like just was like being really pissy about it, I was like good it's like you know I worked my fucking ass off to get where I am right now is like the only fucking reason why. you're out on the streets and share this because you've earned all your bridges and you've given been given countless chances and you constantly Fuck them up, because you feel a sense of entitlement. And I was like an honestly you're too much of a fucking pussy to admit that you fucked up and you need help. Right and friggin he just like oh I don't need help, I make my fucking own way in the world and i'm like yeah and you're fucking sitting on the fucking corner and grouping is fucking in a goddamn 10. begging for fucking food like somebody owes you I was like you know when are you going to fucking pull your head out of your ass is like he's got two kids you know and it's like. But he he, like looks at their children, even like they owe him, something you know, like like talks about his his daughter now is 18 you know i've known her since she was a baby and like he just. talks about his daughter like she's just some insane little fucking bitch that just turned her back on her dad and i'm like no actually you were just a fucking horrible father and never took care of your daughter so she caught on after a while you know. And he's just one of those guys that like I mean he's gonna die out here because he just. He just never. suffered. yeah and he's got like he he also is so arrogant, you know he thinks way too highly of themselves like you know, like, I can understand, having maybe a little bit of confidence, or like. You know, whatever, but like he's just like oh no I I don't need that shit you know frickin and now he's just straight up like with all like. No, I hate being sober but i'm fine with that, but you know frickin I can't find a job and I can't get any food, and I can have a warm place to stay like you know and it's everybody else's fault, not mine like you know it's really pathetic like. You know, and he. Like Fuck man and he's never going to get it, I mean like there was a night when he was at my old house where literally both me and my best friend both stuff i've done to this dude's head, you know because he was just he was being that out of control, you know and. really like yeah i'm like frickin trying to like you know swing on some of the fucking girls and just really fucked up violence shit you know, so we kind of put them in this place and.

8710.0,Patient,"yeah. Like us, I mean I never met somebody who like literally could cross the line that far, for me, but like that guy really like he just sits with me in such a bad spot that like. Like I I had to get to the point where, after I kicked him out of my place and shit like I lost my place to live and to go live with my mother in law it's like. I would make sure that I wouldn't put myself around them, because in like the mental state that I was in at that time, like i'd hit that fucking point where I just didn't care anymore. And like it was really dangerous I mean like I i'm actually really glad that I never did anything like. That I was really capable of at the time, because, like, I mean he was one of those people that like if he would have gotten my way at that time I probably had to kill them and, like I like I hate that thought, but like I was in a really like dark frickin spot in my life at that time and. Like I just didn't I didn't care about nothing anymore and. Like I wouldn't hurt my loved ones or anything like that you know, but like I just tried to stay away from them too, because, like, I was like really reckless downward spiral, and like I was just. I didn't want to take anybody with me, but there was a couple people that you know if they'd have pushed the wrong buttons I probably had a gladly get it, you know and like that's. fucking suck me i'm like.
