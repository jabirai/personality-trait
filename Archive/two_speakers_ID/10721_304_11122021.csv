Like kind of On top of that, and i'm letting all my patients know because I don't know like if you. were aware of this but. Basically, if you if you miss a uds. For best if you if you miss a uds like if the cup comes to your House and you don't do it basically it'll trigger you having to go into the lab. In pursue, and so I know just the inconvenience of that you know people don't like to do that so. Just whenever that cup comes do you, you should get a confirmation email like a shipping confirmation to say hey it's on the way so within a week if it, you know, for whatever reason you don't get it. That would be like your indication to call virtual clinic. me like the Cup. yeah and then just you know perform the test like within a day or two of receiving it and then that way you won't have to be inconvenienced so. yeah you've been on top of all that surveys all that so. yeah we really appreciate that and that just makes things easier for you ultimately oh. yeah well have I guess i'll see before next week."

In one month, because that is near the birthday of his son, who passed away. But other than that lani is pretty stable so i'm going to take a look at his care intensity and probably update him to quarterly and then i'm also going to talk with Dr Oliver and see how he's doing on his. urine drug screens and i'm gonna look at the history, too, and if Dr Oliver agrees i'll probably recommend that he could go to quarterly on his urine drug screens so i'm going to pop on pulse really quick and do that.
