383.0,Provider,"Okay, if. there's a way you can stay on with the virtual clinic and and and be with us or know that that's not possible."
14447.0,Patient,"I don't know how to do that I just got my new iPad so I don't I don't know how to do it like to be on with them, and I mean. i'm doing something wrong Lucy. i'll spend like more than half our session trying to with them and trying to log in and right."
383.0,Provider,Right right.
14447.0,Patient,"I don't know, maybe millennials are better at this than I am."
383.0,Provider,"Well i'm glad that you made it and maybe before we get into you know. what's going on with you and and so forth. If you don't mind just want to review a little bit of your chart because there's been a lot of no shows there's since, so I don't know if you've been ill, I think there was."
14447.0,Patient,"yeah I told them that I missed an appointment with you and I was really sorry about that. They told me I had it with you today it's three would be my next appointment, then the day before the group I said, you know with careful consideration. With all that i'm paying I can't do a $30 a week and the group is 15 minutes, but there are so many participants. That it hasn't been as effective for me because I don't get the feedback or get to feel connected to the group as a whole. In that short duration and time it's like by the time everybody checks in and everything it's it's over so I just haven't found it to be beneficial for me as far as for my own my own needs. In support and also in you know financially because. I really. I I got a lot out of group sessions that were two to three hours because topics would be brought up and they would go around right and people shared and it was really, really effective for me so i've been a part. of groups that were really effective and then you, you also got to hear about what other people did in certain situations and how it benefited them, so there were a lot of takeaways and I just wasn't. It just wasn't like that, for me."
383.0,Provider,"Okay. Personally, so the thing is, is that. there's no shows two groups, but also to your appointment with chantel and."
14447.0,Patient,"He didn't know about the appointment to shantytown as a matter of fact, my. provider that provides my medication is my primary care physician Ivan Nichols So when I called up I said, I have a doctor, so I don't understand. The doctor with amanda that doesn't make sense to me and I thought that the chantelle was an intake coordinator, that was confirming my medication and if I had it. So I don't feel like I don't really know what her don't mean like I don't know about that appointment or anything but I do know I canceled the group, and I do know, I made a mistake when I missed yours."
383.0,Provider,"OK, so the. So maybe we should clarify, you know. Do you are you're basically getting your medications prescribed from your doctor and you don't. want intel's. expertise with regards to medications."
14447.0,Patient,"I I didn't get any expertise I got what was I on and to continue. prescription. And so I thought that her role was when I first started right heart health was to know what I was taking and that I was on medication, not that she was a part of my. team, and then I was thinking, why is she on the group thing and asking about meds when I have my meds that are called in, you know my meds that are given to me by my primary care physician, so it wasn't I don't."
383.0,Provider,"Okay, well, maybe we understand that maybe we didn't. There wasn't already and. Trust she's she's not a psychiatrist but she is has the education and training to prescribe psychiatric medications, so I think you didn't get an orientation to bright our health, in terms of you know. yeah you didn't get that orientation that I do with new folks coming in."
14447.0,Patient,"Now I thought she was just verifying that I, yes, I was on medication, when I was taking and that was that. I didn't I mean nothing else has been discussed with her anything on that on those levels. Especially not a real level that I have with my primary."
383.0,Provider,"Okay, well, she she does prescribe and we have many patients that and we have other doctors and and prescribers with bright heart health. Because we provide tell us psychiatry so basically That means that people we have you know medication professionals that can prescribe and do and do manage people's medications. And because you were. I don't know if you didn't get the orientation, but there's generally we're trying to implement an orientation, so people know what they're you know what."
14447.0,Patient,What his role is. right that would have been helpful for me. yeah and.
383.0,Provider,"So we are. So that's why you know I address I looked at that, too, because. If if you can cancel your your groups or and or I can you know, reduce the the group frequency, if you would could come once per month, if you would agree to come once per month for group I can't eliminate group all together from. people's. You know care plan because essentially you have sort of a care plan that you are having therapy twice per month and then group therapy generally people come once per week, particularly if you've a recent been in the hospital recently. We could reduce it to every other week or. I mean, I have to confer with chantel if I went down to just once per month, just because she is she is on the team and. she's you know in that group and she's been assigned to you, she did have that initial appointment with her so. What is it you feel like you, you know you need right now in terms of mental health support."
14447.0,Patient,"and therapy, I mean I just had a you know major surgery, just a few weeks back and. I have a lot on my plate, you know I just I have a lot of responsibilities and i'm not a mullingar and i'm looking for work and I. I feel like for support, I just need. You know therapy and I need to if i'm going to be in a group setting I need it to be really. interactive and and definitely not as many participants and more. You know, focused on a group that maybe last at least two hours or something it's just not enough time to. To. I I need more out of something that I log into as a group. Okay, so."
383.0,Provider,"We we are, I mean I don't control the length of the groups and. we've been doing this longer and more intensive, you may want to ask your primary care doctor if there's any referrals for intensive outpatient treatment in your area or I could put a request for bright heart health to seek that out in your area."
14447.0,Patient,"And then yeah that might be a more effective for me. And and more conducive to better treatment for me at my age. Okay, to I you know, I think, maybe a millennial or somebody younger, maybe, would it, you know going in but it just wasn't working for me and I don't need to meet with a doctor every week, do you know that the meeting with a doctor once a month. Is. is perfect, but Ivan Nichols has been my. You know prescriber for my medication and and my medication was originally prescribed by a psychiatrist in St joseph's hospital and it's specific to my injury."
383.0,Provider,"mm hmm so you. Know patients, for your your physical. Well, being, as well as psychiatric medications yes and."
14447.0,Patient,"Yes, and I have to look into a program, which is very frustrating for me, because it has to separate mental health from being on opioids as long as I have been almost four years so. I am very frustrated because I need to I need to be able to enter a program that specific just to opioid. With you know with the opioids that i've been given for a back injury that I sustained in the car accident, and I know and I can't have it overlap any mental health because of the the situation with my back injury and."
383.0,Provider,My stay on those medications the opioids are you.
14447.0,Patient,"know I don't want to be on anything like that I I that's not I don't want my body to be slow down, I feel like a lot of my life, you know being lethargic and needing to lay down and rest, I think a lot of it was because i'm on all of those opioids. And it's been. it's been hard since 2017 since the car accident I I don't want to be this kind of person I don't want to lack energy and I lacked it when I worked, and it was really hard for me. I had to drink a lot of coffee and. And I was often you know, it was in a lot of pain. Because the opioids made me tired, so that if I didn't take them, I was in pain that I was up. So it's."
383.0,Provider,"it's hard, what are you taking are you are you off opioids now."
14447.0,Patient,"No, no, I, I have a I have a current prescription for pain management as a result of my surgery, so I have pain medication and it's. You know it's due to my surgery."
383.0,Provider,"Okay, but you said you've been taking them also related to your other injury as well, like four years ago."
14447.0,Patient,"You know my my injury happened, four years ago."
383.0,Provider,Right.
14447.0,Patient,"And, have you though I have been i've had. Nine procedures and i've had three surgeries. So i'm. saying so my my car accident, I was. In was December 4 2017. So that's when I was injured so it's been four years. of having pain medications prescribed to me of all varied strengths and all very you know. You know, dangerous and addictive pain medicine and I haven't been at a point where I can get off it, and so I need to go into an opioid program related to my. The car accident, where I was hit by an unlicensed uninsured driver now my attorney means the Program. You know, to focus on the opioid addiction that happened as a result of the car accident."
383.0,Provider,me don't we do treat opioid addiction here by health.
14447.0,Patient,"But I need it to be like an Inpatient thing, where I go in. And I get off the opioids and that's it, but it can't bring in my other mental health stuff because it's you know it's frustrating because. it's like it's like all right, I divorced in 2017 Oh, is it my fault that I divorced, and was depressed and then got in an accident, when the Attorney wants to make it seemed like Oh, there could have been something wrong with me when I was T boned by an unlicensed driver so. Do you know what i'm saying so it's like they've asked to do, mental health. send me to like a psychiatrist but we're not making any mental health damages there's no, I just want my broken back to be taken care of. i'm not blaming them for any added. Depression as a result of my accident."
383.0,Provider,"to mine like accentuating your device and it's. Oh, I just seeing part of you, and then and then."
14447.0,Patient,"Okay, all right."
383.0,Provider,"i'm just kind of it seems like you, you want you have you know you have some special requirements and some special related to overlapping some overlapping. Situation overlapping problems."
14447.0,Patient,"And I can tell you understand that, because it's like. it's like the accident, for me, was kicking me while I was down."
383.0,Provider,"The thing is, is that if you want to dive into therapy with me i'm you know i'm part of bright heart health and. And I know we do address people with opioid addiction and we do have and we work with them."
14447.0,Patient,But how do they separate that. From a person's.
383.0,Provider,"on it. We don't system patient we don't do impatient, you know it's obviously it's not an impatient situation so you're not going in patient to detox, which is a completely separate thing."
14447.0,Patient,What is the best way to do that because I was told by those that do Inpatient that that's the best because you go in your you come out you're you're on nothing so I don't know i've never been in a situation like i've like i'm in now.
383.0,Provider,"What is your primary care doctor advice, since he's prescribing medications and it seems our ivies, this is the woman, I BA."
14447.0,Patient,Oh Ivan Ivan Nichols he's a gentleman he's.
383.0,Provider,Ivan oh yeah.
14447.0,Patient,"He said I could do I could do one of I could either try to taper it down but going into a program would be effective for me. Because you're going in with nothing and you're coming out not doing that and then he would be in the understanding that we're done prescribing and be prescribing me other resources for pain management that would be of lesser addiction or right now, I have a current prescription. And I haven't made a decision on when i'm going to enter that inner a program whether it's yours, or whether it's a hospital based Program. So I don't I have no idea what my options are and what they look like, so I can't make a. I can't make a decision, either way, especially at this point i'm not in a position to make that decision today. I don't know what i'm because I they want me to look at it, maybe for November, maybe into November I don't know."
383.0,Provider,Okay who's they.
14447.0,Patient,My family. My parents.
383.0,Provider,"Okay, and so. They want you to look at going in patient to detox."
14447.0,Patient,"They are they think i'll have them have more support, if I were to be impatient they're worried that I won't have enough support outpatient. So. But they I mean they we've never had any of our family members go into any any program or anything like this, so. We don't have anybody that's. gone through what i'm going going through so they don't really know they're looking to people. You know that do know that can give some. insight into what would be the best course of action for me."
383.0,Provider,"Well, I can put a request into our case management team and see if they can give you some referrals in your area for. opioid. addiction in patient, you know detox. You may already know, have some in your area."
14447.0,Patient,All I know is hope hospital that's the only one that i've been. referred to buy my insurance and there was there was one in Laguna beach too. Okay.
383.0,Provider,"So you have some. yeah I just I just know that it's going to be problematic to get you down to. i'll talk to shauntel to you know, to reduce the group frequency."
14447.0,Patient,You were saying just to maybe I could do one once a week I mean I mean not once a week once a month.
383.0,Provider,"I mean, I think, initially, should like to see probably twice a month. And then, because you're basically right now seeing your other therapist every."
14447.0,Patient,"Every seen him at all. I haven't made a point to see him at all i've just been trying to get my taxes done and get done with a lot of the stuff that I have to have had to be focused on which I did do. Okay, and yeah."
383.0,Provider,"So you have. And so what was your thinking in terms of. How I mean it sounds like you've been doing Okay, even if you haven't seen him."
14447.0,Patient,"i've been trying my best to get things done. My my loan has been pre approved through the existing mortgage lender to we redo my interest rate, which would make my home loan more affordable and that i'm happy about i'm waiting to receive the paperwork on that. I got my taxes in I haven't received the tax refund, yet I. Know yeah I mean I rented out my. place for three months, and you know, to give myself time in the New Year. The day."
383.0,Provider,"Just hold on one minute my cup the door, and I want to let him in before the. Air just one moment."
14447.0,Patient,Oh yeah.
383.0,Provider,Thank you.
14447.0,Patient,yeah sure I am. So it's just been a been a lot on my plate and. You know all all different other personal things so it's.
383.0,Provider,"It sounds like you've been getting some things accomplished, though."
14447.0,Patient,"You know, some things are accomplished, and a lot of other things on my emotional side art so it's. I feel good about the things I have accomplished. That was, you know really good and things that I thought were not going to be good turned out better and just. You know i'm going to be and I have been looking for employment and putting in that I will work any place that they send me, so I think that what i'll do is see where I get a job opportunity and then either relocate rent my house out or cross that bridge when I come to it. I don't want to. I don't want you know feel like I don't want to feel pressure to make decisions and I don't know what is going to happen. But."
383.0,Provider,OK so here. We have you how are you doing with energy wise in terms of. Thinking about going back to work.
14447.0,Patient,Right now i'm just tired and I think that when I can kick the opioids and the paint you know the painkillers then i'll feel a lot better. i'm just tired a lot.
383.0,Provider,mm hmm.
14447.0,Patient,"and i'm irritated that I don't have any financial or emotional support from my daughter's father, but there's not going to be any and. it's it is what it is, you know I could rent that room out that she's staying in for 1000 a month and. He thinks that you know it's just nothing that's going to solve itself that is the way it is. And I don't think she should be punished for having a parent that doesn't make it. make it a priority to assist giving her a place to live like I do and he's not going to help out with anything so that's been really bugging me."
383.0,Provider,"mm hmm What did you feel wanted to talk about today was there, something you felt like you wanted to."
14447.0,Patient,"um. i'm just you know I feel sad that i've you know i've been seeing a man that I feel just sees me for dinner and intimacy and I don't and he has done some nice nice things for me, but. I. I don't know I just. it's not I don't have. You know I thought I was going to have a boyfriend to spend some more time with, and he you know he needs to fly back and be with his family and St Louis and I understand that, but. What it's like two weekends in a row, and he just leaves and he's not apologetic about anything which it's his family and I just don't know how. You know what's healthy for me as far as. You know my. Self esteem and he's. he's really supportive when it comes to my you know my law case. And he's you know gone with me to doctors appointment he's been very kind and in many different situations there's just not the. The effort to spend some more quality time with me. I mean, he talks it's been over five months, and he talks about us going away for an eye, he talks about this, he talks about that, and nothing. Nothing. and And like I said he has done some nice things but it's not it's not making me feel I don't know what kind of a future any is with this person so. um that's been. You know that's been hard."
383.0,Provider,"Sorry, my."
14447.0,Patient,"My my mom was calling, let me just let her know we're on the phone but. It that's been hard."
383.0,Provider,But that does sound. sounds like you are seeking. More from a partner than what.
14447.0,Patient,Casey is looking for.
383.0,Provider,"It seems like you are seeking more from a. partner, he has that What, then, what he's offering."
14447.0,Patient,yeah and I also. I I just don't like it when i'm told. You know that we're going to do you know real do this will do that and it's not nothing's come to fruition.
383.0,Provider,uh huh. yeah.
14447.0,Patient,"So that's been frustrating. You know it's like someone that says to yeah we're going to go away for that night in palm springs we're going to go do this we're going to go do that. And then, when I do spend time with him up in La he makes a point to go to his tennis and on you know, on a Sunday morning and. And then. comes back and then goes and runs like four miles and then barely has the bandwidth to have a nice dinner with me. and claims that he was just tired he just it's he's an eccentric person I mean."
383.0,Provider,Are you off a bit from from this relationship and.
14447.0,Patient,"I haven't been I don't know what i'm. I don't know what i'm doing, I mean he's he's I mean in the way he talks to me it's like I love you i'm thinking of you, I miss you. Can I mean, can you imagine amount of someone that talks to you that way Oh, by the way, I love you just wanna let you know I love you i'm thinking of you. But. Right, I am over last. week and we had dinner and were intimate and I went off and visited my family and i've come back and my depositions and me me me me me and."
383.0,Provider,It sounds that he's telling you he loves you.
14447.0,Patient,"Know he's telling me verbally. and And I just. being told that there's a certain amount of of. it's not just somebody telling me that it's showing me physically and mentally and he'll say Oh, but I talked to your attorney and oh I. You know CC but I don't need another attorney like that I need a boyfriend I mean I felt like I wanted a boyfriend and wanted somebody that I really care very much about him I feel a lot of love for him, but it's starting to wane when I realized we haven't we haven't really amanda. Then anywhere other than to eat. And hang out with him in his you know I mean it's been very superficial. Other than that, I mean he came and picked me up from the hospital. He dropped me off, but then he had to jettison out again. And then, when I was in the hospital like three days and I didn't receive any flowers from him but i'd gotten you know flowers from my parents and my best friends and I said, you know, can you, you know you know, can you please send me flowers like it wasn't his own accord and it's. he's only he'd only been married five years, whereas i've been married over I was married over 21 years. And I just am disappointed that when I mentioned like where do you see us in the next year he goes well, you have a lot to do, you have to get through your law. Your your law case you have to get a job, you have to get off the opioids you have a lot to do it's like okay I didn't get the we in this."
383.0,Provider,uh huh.
14447.0,Patient,"I mean. And that hurt my feelings and then, when I broached the subject again, he said, will I told you, you know, I have a family and. I had to pay to have divorce attorneys and I, you know I have debts and if any of your friends, you know. And I said well everybody has debts and your situation prior to meeting you is what you come with, and you have three incredible children, and you are very kind and and I said so there's always going to be situations with people you care about and that's, a fact that I know all too well. mm hmm and he kind of just he what he does really well as he changes the subject."
383.0,Provider,"So anyway. That was speaking directly to him, you are having. Your free to speak directly."
14447.0,Patient,"Oh yeah we were we were at my house and then we, and I said to him directly I said I just. And he took me to this nice restaurant and proceeded just tell me, all these things I need to do, and then told the waiter that we were celebrating and then, when the waiter came. He laughed and I said, what are we celebrating and he says, oh anytime I go out to Nice dinners I always say i'm celebrating and I said well. I hope it isn't you know, to get a free dessert because that's not the way I was raised when when my dad told or even you know my ex husband if we were celebrating you're celebrating you know what are we celebrating it's not funny to me amanda don't I mean. that's not funny to me and I told him that, and he goes well. You know what I came down and I assisted in a little party that my roommate through for his four year old and. The cake wasn't made and I thought it was so sweet that my boyfriend waited for the cake, to be made 45 minutes had my my sweet roommates daughter's name put on it was so kind and doing that. Whereas my past experiences that would have been What did you do wrong why wasn't a cake made, I went all the way there and then it wasn't instead of finding a solution. Being solution oriented, and what would be the most thoughtful thing to do. They want to. find the blame find the person to blame and then do the least. What takes the least time possible. You know I mean like he could have just picked up to ready made cakes and had her name popped on it, but he actually had a 45 minute wait for them to make a chocolate cake. And it was really, really thoughtful and. But I was hurt that when I confronted him about the restaurant, because we were in a very nice restaurant. And when I confronted him within the week after realizing that if I kept it in, I would just get more and more hurt and we were we were. At my house, he said, well i've been trying to do my best to show you how much I love you and I mean look, I had the cake made and I. You know, and this matt and that just hurt me so much amanda that it was Why did he have to mention something he did that was so kind as if I was so stupid to not. know that that was so kind, do you know I mean it, it took away from some of the some of the love that I felt in that being such a kind act that i'm not the kind of woman that someone needs to say oh and but I did this, and I did this for you and i've done that for you and and. You know he's just a very kind person he you know I i'm very attracted to him, I do get disappointed on his self care I i'm not used to being around a man that was one pair of shoes that stink all the time I don't understand his lack of self care. That was bizarre to me. I don't know just to bring that up to you, I mean and he'll go I took a shower and i'm thinking, what are you like telling me you did I mean. it's that's odd to me."
383.0,Provider,"mm hmm. It sounds like this relationship is not fulfilling to you in several ways, but. You know. Is it something that you think that you're going to maybe distance yourself from just a little bit just so that you can."
14447.0,Patient,"I don't want to be as intimate with him because it's I feel it's leading him down the path that i'm Okay, with a dinner and being intimate and him leaving me the next day. i'm not. And why i'm behaving that way is upsetting to myself. Okay, and he assumes that. You can be a couple he doesn't feel that marriages, is very important. And I you know I might not be a like a Bible thumping religious person, but I feel very much that I am not. I have not been successful, being a girlfriend I have been a partner, so my last relationship is three and a half years. So. That I."
383.0,Provider,"Well, you have the right to set a boundary. You know, and to decide what kind of relationship that you want and. Were you in the Group when we talked about boundaries."
14447.0,Patient,"Yes, yes, and I wanted to read the thing, but once we once you presented it, it was like the group was over so quick, it was you know, and I just."
383.0,Provider,"yeah so. You know boundaries are based on an initial self kind of self reflection on what your values are what you're Okay, with a not okay with. And with regard you know there's there's different types of boundaries, I think i'm not sure you were in the group, where we talked about like physical boundaries and intellectual boundaries and emotional boundaries and. The different types of."
14447.0,Patient,"bound yeah I remember when that was when that was presented, but the physical you know it's it's obviously provides him with something but it's not doing the same for me."
383.0,Provider,"Right, the sexual boundaries. Yes, yeah so. If you know you can set a boundary and you can make a decision about what kind of relationship you want and what kind of boundary that you want to set around around sex and. You it really comes down to a decision, you know, on your part, and then. And then moving forward with your behaviors to follow through with your decision of what kind of boundary that you want to."
14447.0,Patient,mm hmm.
383.0,Provider,It sounds like your communication with him is pretty direct.
14447.0,Patient,"i've tried to be, but what I got back was kind of a kind of what I would say, was more gaslighting and you know redirecting it to the cake that he had made, and then it hurt me to think that he needed to bring that up to me, as if I wasn't giving him. Enough Thank you and how much that meant to me because that's what I tried to make it very clear to him how. How much I I loved that he did that and how thoughtful that was of him, and how instead of finding, who was guilty he found the solution and how much that meant to me. So I didn't want it to be when he when he brought it up like Oh, but, and then I have the cake made and I took care of the cake it's like. You know even you know, have the cake made and paid for the cake and i'm thinking. Now that gets into really hurtful things to me because that reminds me of what i've experienced in past relationships, where someone says. Oh, I paid for this and i've done this and i've done that, and so I made a decision at that point amanda and I want you to know to not bring up the fact that I have spent which I necessary most necessary should not have done was I bought him clothing."
383.0,Provider,"Oh, I."
14447.0,Patient,"bought a man that that makes at least 180 a year, clothing, because I wasn't comfortable with the way that this man was dressing, and I felt that I could buy him a couple things and I did online and that's not what I should have done. So, and that go and i'm not his wife. and his girlfriend and that overstepped boundaries for myself. That I did that. Because it was me trying to find another way like how he purchased the cake that I could show him that I was thinking of him and I bought him a I bought him like a sweater a hoodie to flannel shirts and a jacket and, mind you it's not Christmas nor his birthday, so it was completely. awful of my boundaries."
383.0,Provider,Okay.
14447.0,Patient,"So I was very much upset with myself. When I reflected because that's something I also have done in the past, where I am in a relationship or even with a boyfriend and I feel that. You know I try to show them that i'm thinking of them and I buy gifts and I am frustrated that I do that and it's kind of what I grew up with to my. dad bought my mother gifts my mother bought me gifts my ex has been mostly bought me gifts when I wasn't too happy with him which hurt my feelings, because it was you know, and I was responsible for a lot. at different points in our marriage and taking care of things for him for him and I just feel that I resorted back to that and he said, thank you, but, at the time, he said, the cake, I made sure, not to mention well i've bought you close i've never said that. I never said anything like that I never brought it up, but and but inside, I thought about it and I thought oh. stupid katie goes right back to what she knows didn't work in the past, you know I didn't you know. And I asked him if he could buy one more pair of shoes, because he only wears black high top reeboks and you can laugh at that because. I was like I didn't think it was real because he's an attorney you really wears black stinky smelly now I don't. If someone's going to that's the one shoe amanda that they're gonna wear all the time, so be it, have two pairs the pair you were for work, the pair you were to run in. But he's that's the way he is he's like a disheveled kind of attorney and and then, I feel that people don't treat him respectfully because his appearance doesn't garner that respect from his associates. And I spent three and a half years with somebody and i'm you know we're always able to figure out everybody else, except ourselves."
383.0,Provider,"Right right, and I would. yeah I think you need to pull back a bit. Okay, you know. you're trying to fix him and trying to you know get him more shoes and Nice clothes. Your expense it's and you want to turn that energy to yourself and look at these tendencies and address the boundaries, and you know. kind of create a plan for your mental health i'm glad that you've gotten your refinancing on your House, it sounds like. And the taxes was huge. So i'll think you're you know you're making progress and taking care of nuts and bolts, and that was what we had talked about in our last appointment is you know getting some of these things. accomplished and seeing that you can accomplish them so that you know I think you're done well and I we're going to need to to to. finish our appointment, but I wanted to tell you a couple of things, one is that you can check into the virtual clinic up to 24 hours prior to your appointment, so I do recommend you check in hours before your appointment. In the UK, not wait 30 minutes because, especially in the afternoon there's like a traffic jam. And there's a lot will come in into the virtual clinic so you can check, you can check in the day before up to 24 hours before. The other thing is that I have scheduled an appointment for you, if you can make it for next week at three o'clock on Tuesday."
14447.0,Patient,"All right, let's do it let's do three o'clock next and in anything they need to resolve and i'm, and again I apologize for missing that appointment with you, I. was really seriously bomb because I needed the appointment with you. And I was just like oh my gosh I I was really frustrated at myself, and I take full responsibility for missing that and I wanted to be honest with you about the group appointment because I."
383.0,Provider,"Really, I really."
14447.0,Patient,You know.
383.0,Provider,"That if we we might be able to address some of the opioid problem down the road with with the tight ration with Shan tells assistance, because she does you know we do medication assisted treatment, whether it's chantelle or another bright heart health md but or you know prescribe her. But let's let's look at that later. yeah that I don't think i'm going to be able to get whether it's for my supervisor that you come that you be brought down to."
14447.0,Patient,once a month. No that'd be the.
383.0,Provider,"Specially because you're just recently, out of the hospital they're going to say definitely probably they might agree twice a month."
14447.0,Patient,"Okay. Well, at least if they do twice a month it's just that between you know, two co pays and then one hour in the middle of the afternoon it's just and I don't feel like I. it's just a number of things."
383.0,Provider,"I just recommend that you come to the group knowing this is this is i'm going to pull something up get something from this this hour it's not going to be in depth group therapy. But you're going to get something from it, it right now it's better than nothing, because you're not in another Program. You know, at least, while you're with us, I don't think I can bend the rules. OK, not."
14447.0,Patient,"OK so maybe I can go every other week and that way, maybe that will work."
383.0,Provider,yeah i'm going to put a note in.
14447.0,Patient,"So I will plan to go this week at three. Okay, and then our next appointment is next Tuesday at three."
383.0,Provider,"yeah i'm going on vacation for a week and so i'll see you next week and then and then in two weeks after that. You do need to fill out a couple of surveys, so you want to get those done before Thursday."
14447.0,Patient,"Okay, I did fill out one and the other one wasn't applicable to me i'm not in a dual diagnosis program and the Web by what I mean is, like the program it's like if someone's an alcoholic or they do street drugs."
383.0,Provider,"Not just street drugs it's any addiction to another substance, so it could be opioid addiction, it could be, but that's not you're not trapped for that right now."
14447.0,Patient,"Okay, because I was concerned that they sent me the wrong form, I filled out one of the two forms that they sent."
383.0,Provider,"Okay, you have to fill out the forms every week prior to group. You have. The surveys every week, not just once."
14447.0,Patient,"Oh Okay, I did not know that I thought it was a one time compliance thing."
383.0,Provider,"No, no. it's weekly we're tracking these are these are Depression and anxiety surveys so we're. tracking your responses, over time, hopefully to see those responses reflect improvements so that's why. We ask that you fill them out weekly now I realize it's you know kind of kind of tedious and stuff, and again I don't have any control over."
14447.0,Patient,"That, I know I understand amanda I do. Because I mean with any job it's like they have to things the way they do them. And I completely understand that so let's um."
383.0,Provider,"there's also a lab recommendation. I mean it's it's just a form that needs to be signed, so you need to call the virtual clinic back if you came directly into this. Point okay and."
14447.0,Patient,"Okay, I will do that i'll call them back. Okay don't do that now. Okay okay all right. care."
