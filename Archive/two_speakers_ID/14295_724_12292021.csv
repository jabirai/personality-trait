14295.0,Patient,"I don't want to look at the skill, right now, so jumping back from Chicago but. Before I was the lowest also 187 that. was pretty gain 20 pounds, because here I lost weight during the beginning of the year, they gained."
724.0,Provider,yeah. yeah I feel like like like the the opposite downs of working from home now being stuck in the House and all that kind of stuff isn't helping with the. Healthy healthy habits that's for sure.
14295.0,Patient,yeah.

14295.0,Patient,The last from my last job that. was clear to client how how I was I started to how it was being health was bad so.
724.0,Provider,I.
14295.0,Patient,"definitely believe that experience for the by the client and health. started drinking more. Well, last year that's how I started it off right, I had. that she got I had gotten very drunk new year's Eve party didn't remember, everything else is easy stuff like that happens that. pushes me not the not the journey or taking a break from it, so I that's why I didn't drink at all During January or February last year, so our this earlier this year so hopefully. That will help drive the help I can get back into that not drinking it all, at least for the beginning of the year. that's helpful."
724.0,Provider,How much have you been drinking.
14295.0,Patient,"drink more when i'm. With my family. drink I drink throughout the entire day yesterday, which is like not total bad thing there. was a you know replenish the alcohol. And else see my brother, a couple times drink good job. So. yeah I definitely more one there. In West allis drink so."
724.0,Provider,Yes. Social environmental thing.
14295.0,Patient,"House so. hope that. i'm. feeling more inspired to do it now, but. yeah so being sort of a little bit cloudy I have let me do I still haven't got my adderall back. I don't know if that's necessarily about I would prefer not to have guys put on it. and Go cold Turkey right yeah."
724.0,Provider,that's the way.
14295.0,Patient,"that's the way that's the healthiest thing to do, let us know how that works is that most definitely it depresses."
724.0,Provider,yeah i'm not sure if there's like a rebounding effect or not for but. yeah once once it's in the system anytime you probably stopped it's not. it's not gonna be helpful.
14295.0,Patient,"It was taught, I have been in contact with shark tale, but after I told her about the back order or whatever the pharmacist told me I had heard from her again so. yeah so it's been over over most now, I think, without. which I think was there to sort of balance out the traveling so it all works well, I don't know but i'm. not really terrible i'm just kind of trying to get my priorities straight. laughs langley considering a. Like taking a break from. Right bright bright heart heart for a little bit just because so. This i'm trying to get you know priority wise I know that's. Like mental health for me it's important i'm also not being able to it's kind of getting away from me doing some stuff that I do for my mental health."
724.0,Provider,"Right. Some years basic self care, you know what I mean."
14295.0,Patient,"yeah was it just becomes more of a. chore. And mostly with like the group. That seeing that feels like a lot of like a chore. Do, especially when are you at the time that i'm doing it. Also, like like I get scheduled for things. I call in and takes 20 minutes for me to get in and then they tell me that the appointment is it was a different day, even though it's what I have. Now so yeah so it gets kind of where I shaved my whole day around my appointments, so I make I make every the entire day and make and make decisions based off of what time would I need to be somewhere. yeah. i'm not necessarily feeling maybe because i'm still and so completely neutral right now, with everything that i'm not feeling necessarily. In crisis or anything like that. yeah I don't i'm not sure I was just something that's been. On my mind recently."
724.0,Provider,"Well, if you if you decide that the scale back and services, obviously we want to make sure that you're doing. Like enough self cared you know for yourself to compensate you know for for dropping off because I don't know if you get anything as far as like accountability out of it, or if it helps with your like your regimen. I just want to make sure that you're filling those gaps with things that are you're actually going to do a benefit from so i'm all on board with. You know it'd be like if you're trying to improve your real self care by going to the gym and doing all that kind of stuff for sure yeah I just don't want you to to lose this and then not follow through with you know the goals that you set up in place as."
14295.0,Patient,"yeah yeah absolutely. yeah i'm not i'm just not sure. that's just. Thinking, but it has become more of an inconvenience. But I do know that muscle national sure about the I know i'm not if I am when I get off the medication that needs to be. treated like like that, no, no. Just sort of observation I can't just go golf cold Turkey with the. yeah just go, let me ask you on this way because the medication so."
724.0,Provider,"yeah I mean the idea with you know when we get all these like the precedence and accessorize or like a mood stabilizers is like. it's like anything else Oh, like the equivalent to like taking antibiotics, you know, looking at your sick you take a shot to feel better than you're like Okay, I guess i'll do it, and then. You know what I mean like like back in the day, we just we stop halfway through if you're feeling like you're in a better place, it could be a combination of that and the fact that you're on the medication."
14295.0,Patient,"And the sooner that you like him in a better place, though it's more."
724.0,Provider,manageable.
14295.0,Patient,yeah I guess.
724.0,Provider,yeah that's kind of what it's supposed to do yeah.
14295.0,Patient,"I mean it was what it's more of a neutral were. The only thing that's part about this is that the things that were worried before I don't care about but also I don't care about I care about getting my health together as much as I normally would worry about about that which. wouldn't i'd be a good thing, how much I would worry about it, because that would be what got me to go. By filter. By right now i'm still. i'm. Acknowledging it. see what I can do about that."
724.0,Provider,"um. You know, if you want. I can try to find like another provider, where you don't have to. You know, you know if you're worried about like the medication component of five like a provider that will just deal with you directly, you know for those medications so like a primary care physician or. Do you have primary care."
14295.0,Patient,Yes.
724.0,Provider,Like your own doctor.
14295.0,Patient,"I don't I have never, I just wish to a different doctor never actually really even seen that before, but I do have one."
724.0,Provider,"Okay, so. Okay, so that would be something to consider is having a conversation with that provider about picking up the medication that you're currently prescribes here that way there's no break. And level so it's not like it's you know it's not suboxone like the medication that that you're receiving from us is common that, like any kind of provider can really do."
14295.0,Patient,yeah.
724.0,Provider,"I like special licensure to do like who's on suboxone or something like that then there's some providers can't do that, but when you try and."
14295.0,Patient,present.
724.0,Provider,"Prozac and, like the adderall Those are all stuff that normal physician can prescribe it since you're receiving it here."
14295.0,Patient,"And I mean I don't the importance of it that's why I did it in the first place i'm in talk therapy isn't it, I guess, with everything being combined all in one it kind of makes it difficult to I think i'm even though i'm better at juggling it will separate. Separate things I have to do than just. Anything that I know some of this one thing affects all the. Other components which is kind of weird at first, I thought was. A good thing but as i've kind of gone it's just we just maybe with my schedule my life right now."
724.0,Provider,"Right yeah it doesn't work for everybody, like nothing's perfect and you know, trying to find ways to make things convenient but it's just difficult I don't understand like."
14295.0,Patient,"What animates this right now I just. i'm gonna try i'm gonna try to. make it work because i'm trying to do, but sometimes I realized, I had to take step back and do one thing at a time. Even though I don't want to be like that I would. Rather, be able to go out stuff i've learned just more recently, though. Sometimes I came out, I can only focus on one thing at a time when it comes to me trying to actually be successful at it. that's what character, like, I was doing and beginning of the year, but I also was not myself and beginning of the year. But um."
724.0,Provider,"Well, if you if you want to proceed one way or the other, like you just you know, let me know and i'll do my best to kind of plug you into like you know into a position to where you're going to continue to succeed right so."
14295.0,Patient,"I mean I go back in office until the next week and. I yeah these are going well. Work wise. I still have much of a. social life, but our i'm right now i'm not tapped into so."
724.0,Provider,So no plans to go out this weekend.
14295.0,Patient,"For new years yeah well the one friend, I really do have right now, he still wants to stop because he wants to go out and party and do stuff all the time. I mean, he only like four years younger than me but i'm in a different place right now, where I need to not do that, because it can lead down a bad road for me. But, so I think he's gonna want to either contact me tonight or didn't want to know when I got back. But I think it'll be gone before new year's so i'm just gonna be staying in here. And my cousins are going to be gone to so. that's that's really far especially how yellow while last year, so."
724.0,Provider,"yeah I mean. You know, setting up like like you know long term healthy goals overseen counterproductive to be to go out and look at the start off the New Year to like totally put yourself at risk of. All kinds of like negative possibilities no idea to go out and like get annihilated and then like. I always thought it was like hypocritical like is you'd be people like what's your new year's resolution would like to get healthy and to. Get back in the gym or get better as well, right after I go out and get completely obliterated and potentially catch a dui or get to. Get arrested or you know we're saw you know anytime I get like to me it's always like super risky so like nothing good ever happens like after midnight when you're out about anyways so. You know, as you get older you're just kind of like it just doesn't make any sense anymore like I get it like when you're younger it's attracted but, like you said you're like in a different place like maturity in there."
14295.0,Patient,"yeah and I know how I am. Drinking I was with my cousins last week a like. I don't even like talking about it, but it just I don't I can't trust like become a different person is not like again i'm like getting drunk and like wobbling around I just kind of have a different mentality and I never want the party to end or you know I will stay out. till 6am what's with strangers and. yeah and. The end up regretting it. immediately when I get home and go sleeping while ago it's a constant cycle I just found myself doing it last week last week or two weeks ago, just because I had been drinking pleasant nice I supposed to be going home. Do not so. i'm trying to. prevent that from happening that's what happens when you drink or you can try to go out, then I had to. Go soon go for one beer that into something far. Worse, so."
724.0,Provider,"What I can't, we have to."

Significant but he did outline some you know long term goals or new year's resolution goals that's continue to focus on. diet and exercise and then setting up healthy healthy boundaries for himself so we'll leave it at that continue to he's still at low risk for si P so expressing protective factors long term goals stuff that nature and I got an appointment to him on January 10 at 515 Thank you."
