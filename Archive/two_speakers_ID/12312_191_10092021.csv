12312.0,Patient,Okay.
191.0,Provider,"Let me just introduce you to the program, and so the intake takes quite a long time, so we want to really understand how we can work with you okay so feel free to. ask me some questions, too, so I usually do an hour, so we have about 48 more minutes left, so we should be able to get through the things we need to get through OK. So we meet doing groups okay so starting off, you will have weekly group appointments for one hour, you also have your own individual therapists and i'll be your. Your individual provider and i'm actually present doing those groups with you, so we have groups in the morning. The afternoon, and we have groups in the evening and usually for a court group, if your court mandated that group is usually in the evenings Thursday evenings we used to have a separate group for our Court patients, but we had so. We had several graduate so we combine the groups so it's usually at six o'clock but I don't know if that's a convenient time for you."
12312.0,Patient,Know that's not I work second shift.
191.0,Provider,Work second shift so what's a good time for you morning or afternoon.

12312.0,Patient,"Yes, I."
191.0,Provider,"Am right yeah so that's like that's a unique time, so we have groups at 1030 in the morning, I have afternoon groups at 12 and one with the afternoon group be better for."

191.0,Provider,"Okay, so let's do Tuesday on noon okay Dan are great so let's talk a little bit about expectations as it relates to group participation so like your insurance company has expectations, of course. We do as a. As an organization so you're tuned two groups at 12 known. So I always use a headset so you can either use a hit set."
12312.0,Patient,Your blood or earpiece.
191.0,Provider,"The reason we do that, Mr. tender which Ms did I say your name correctly."
12312.0,Patient,yeah okay.
191.0,Provider,"So mystifying to risk. The reason we do, that is, that we want to protect your identity, we don't want anybody else to hear other group. Members talking or co Members talking so that's it so on. And in a private location like we've had patients actually walking through to walmart."
12312.0,Patient,Trying to have a group.
191.0,Provider,"And then we just come out a group because no we don't know what at walmart is. Somebody might. recognize their voice, you know what I mean I don't want that so we'll put you out in the group if you're not protecting everybody's identity okay."
12312.0,Patient,"All right, not a problem."
191.0,Provider,"Okay, thank you so have a couple of reminders and we do repeat our sales because it's it's you know so a lot of information starting off. But we try to work really closely with our patients to make certain that you're able to. overcome whatever substance that you're dealing with or function well within an address any mental health chronic pain we deal with different things like that, so the way we do it groups once a week, so your group starts next week Tuesday okay. that's always tell patients, you want to try to check in your group 10 to 15 minutes early so they'll give you the zoom number i'll be there you have a therapist there and there'll be other group members there okay. Okay, all right so number that as you're being compliant, then you will start coming to boot, like every two weeks, and we have some people made it all the way to a month alright, so your groups or weekly starting off, you will have your own therapist so individual therapists um you will."
12312.0,Patient,"I will make. I don't want to interrupt you, but I will say um it'll be the first week of. Know October November, and I will have to go to jail, so I will not be able to attend that me. Okay."
191.0,Provider,"Well, just let us know, and we can just go ahead and cancel that, let us know in advance so that didn't count against you, because."
12312.0,Patient,Okay.
191.0,Provider,"You approach your probation officer does communicate with them and we share the truth, like hey, this is what we found in a urine drug screen oh hey, this is what we, you know the attendance so that's good that you're being proactive, so we could put that on your chart okay. We do surveys, if you get any control substance from us, we count emits you so your individual therapy appointments or two times a month. And you'll see me every week doing group but that's just a bit very quick check in but I meet with you monthly. And then we do your laps Okay, so what I always like to share like in your case Mr Elliot since. You are using alcohol, you want to make certain those liver enzymes, so when you get your labs done, I will go over your labs and I can actually show them to you because we want to make certain that your livers looking good your kidneys looking good. Depending on how the alcohol impact you, we can see changes in red blood cells So these are things we're going to look at okay. Okay, all right man okay all right so definitely want your layups done as soon as you can within one to two weeks okay. Okay, all right so we're gonna back up a little bit and."
12312.0,Patient,Are you going to give me information on. Where to get the labs done.
191.0,Provider,"And they're going to send you an email all in it, where to go. And it does not a convenient place and you let us know what works best for you, we try to work with because, like some people. prefer to go to their hospital instead of going to the quest."
12312.0,Patient,"Okay, so we can open a damn yeah I think I think there was something in my email about where I didn't get I got in trouble, not very close to where I live. And it's like 40 it might be 4550 miles from here. Okay that's why I think a lot of the online counseling and everything because i'm not close to where I got in trouble."
191.0,Provider,And right you like. kind of being anonymous.
12312.0,Patient,"I think the word, they said the email said something about lab work where I got in trouble and that's going to be kind of hard to get there, I don't have a life in general, obviously."
191.0,Provider,"All right, Dan so yeah I. Thought."
12312.0,Patient,It would be better.
191.0,Provider,"Okay, that won't be a problem. So we can work with you on that, and if you when you. When you come to group if that's still an issue we usually have a care navigator right there and we just ask them to please send it to. A place that's close to you so have you know, a hospital, you could get the name and the location of the hospital like let's say this Adams county hospital and it says."
12312.0,Patient,"yeah well, I have a hospital. Right and where I live, yeah. Okay."
191.0,Provider,"Right okay we'll get that from you what's your date of birth, sir. and your zip code, sir."
