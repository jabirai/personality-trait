10773.0,Patient,"And i'm still having the for the last few days, just really bad anxiety and it's in the it's the worst in the morning and then I noticed when I take my the Raza Pam in the afternoon It comes down. Look at them when, for some reason i'm waking up and i'm just still panicked what I wanted to ask is could it be because i'm taking it at the same time as the bins are choking."
298.0,Provider,"So I talked to my boss about you and. He said to go go down on the benzo trooping. Okay, go down to twice a day on that one, it could be a rebound Al anticholinergic effect and that it may be too high, of a dose for you, and he said to go up on the murtaza pain at bedtime."
10773.0,Patient,"Okay, so instead of taking half take a whole one."
298.0,Provider,Of the. yeah and he said we could even start to go up to 30 milligrams and see if you know we start to get some relief that way.
10773.0,Patient,"Okay, so go up to pills it at nighttime."
298.0,Provider,"So, what are you how much is your milligrams. 15 Okay, and what have you been taking."
10773.0,Patient,A half.
298.0,Provider,"Okay, so go up to a fall. Okay, and and do that for about three four days and if you're not getting any relief in your anxiety go up to a whole. Two of them. Okay, but let me know if that you know. If that is a good deal. um."
10773.0,Patient,And then go ahead and. Be abilify not taking it.
298.0,Provider,"Correct continue to not take the abilify. And he said something interesting you have ptsd correct. Yes, and what was the did you have ptsd and ages four to six year old when you were between four and six years old what's their ptsd."

10773.0,Patient,that's with them amanda.
298.0,Provider,"Good good. And you can take the transit down and the murtaza pain together at bedtime correct. Yes, and. Before we add on another antidepressant let's use the murtaza pain to see where we can go what we can get on board with that one."
10773.0,Patient,Okay okay.
298.0,Provider,And I hope that it's just as simple as going down on the benzo tripping to twice a day that you know I mean we can hope.
10773.0,Patient,"Is it okay to take the bins a trophy with the lorazepam in the morning, or should I space them out."
298.0,Provider,"I would space them out. But it really is OK, but it's always good to just know what effect you're getting from both things. and If you're not needing them so tripping anymore, are you having restless leg."
10773.0,Patient,"Yes, i'm still getting the restless leg, even with it."
298.0,Provider,"Okay, and you're not on abilify correct."

10773.0,Patient,"And my sleep is good, except for you know waking up during the night to go pee once we bumped the transit and back up to 100 i'm sleeping good."
298.0,Provider,"Okay, good deal. Alright well we're going to start using the murtaza pain for depression and see about getting it to a higher level to treat depression and see how effective, that is, how would you describe your moods."
