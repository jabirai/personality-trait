ID,Role,Message

726.0,Provider,"Well, you do have to net for next time check in because they notify ethical and it will be in the system has checked in, and if you just go straight to zoom it kind of like bypasses all that."
12103.0,Patient,"it's Okay, for helping me. I think there's an established patient anyway i'm just I gotta get these like I went in and to say I wouldn't be there on Tuesday, because it turned out have a doctor's appointment so then they're like well now you're established patient me to go to this room, and now it might."
726.0,Provider,Have.
12103.0,Patient,been need to go to that room.
726.0,Provider,"They say if you're gonna check in for an appointment always do it like at least a half hour before. Okay yeah that's what they usually do is like come till tell people your appointments at nine try to be try to check in by or beyond by 830 so you can check in I know it feels like a very long process to. just go to an appointment, so I get it."
12103.0,Patient,right when you can just open zoom and go in there you're in.
726.0,Provider,And straight there yeah.
12103.0,Patient,Should I when we're done go to the virtual clinic to make sure that they got me for.
726.0,Provider,that's okay i'll make sure. Okay yeah you're good.
12103.0,Patient,"I am not trying to wonder, you could call it modify the process like circumnavigate the process not."
726.0,Provider,I would not you don't come off as a person like that.
12103.0,Patient,"I don't know I hope not, I really. Know be like. I really value my. My word, since my divorce. yeah I really. Do not like people who are manipulators so."
726.0,Provider,I don't want to come here. manipulative no not at all.
12103.0,Patient,yeah oh it's like. You know. But then again to i'm kind of i'm going to tell you this plenty I feel like when I got to my my other counselor wasn't willing like when I had stuff that bothered me she'd be like well don't do that maybe you should read less romances because it's triggering.
726.0,Provider,Like you told me about that yeah.
12103.0,Patient,"And, and so in that same way, I felt like I could just talk over her talk right through she you know. i'll spin and I think that that's just you get kind of ramped up and she couldn't stop me or she didn't try. Okay, and so I really want to. i'm going to do things differently, I want to feel better. about who, I am as a person be my genuine self and. kind of live my less my life less. triggered because I never asked other people to not trigger me because I know I just like that, because i've learned that when i'm triggered it's about me it's not about what they're doing. Because the same way as when I have trouble with mom or anybody else I say what i'm going to do what i'm gonna do i'm gonna do this. My mom wanted me to answer a question about something in the bathroom and I said I have counseling. I didn't say yeah you say no, I said I have counseling. And it's not my bathroom and I didn't have worked on on it and. Not my not my monkey not my circus."
726.0,Provider,I like that saying not my monkey.
12103.0,Patient,"And when mom retired. That was the big thing that we said, all the time, because she was getting out of the circus so. yeah and. Sometimes around here, things will be calm and mom will search some drama and it's like."
726.0,Provider,Oh interesting.
12103.0,Patient,"And I. Because I still live in my mom's house. yeah still have like. Who am I, you know. And where do I get value, and I have to separate yourself from her because. I know there's childhood things that are still happening now. And I was neglected as a child, and she does like she has this much love to give."
726.0,Provider,yeah.
12103.0,Patient,"And i've learned that that's not true, nobody has a set amount, because she gets to herself first and i've met people that don't do that. People exist and they're beautiful and wonderful and I need more of them in my life. And so. yeah."
726.0,Provider,You go ahead.
12103.0,Patient,"Well, just that. So I feel like the oddball in my family because i'm trying to change a lot. of how I do things and i've already come really far and I know so like. it's been since my divorce it's been a process and it's been great process but hard and i've done it like I did an Inpatient treatment it and Arden Hall, which is a Union Gospel mission associated Inpatient treatment, but it wasn't so much Inpatient as counseling like this was a. program to be counseled. And they hit on different things, but it was religious based and so. 10 years I realized that I can't regret my life before because I wouldn't have had my life after which is healthier mentally than the rest of my family. A lot of them don't even care, and so I am that person going, why are you talking about this. When this happened, and it was horrible and you're just moving on like it didn't happen."
726.0,Provider,I can't yeah.
12103.0,Patient,And and i'm like last year or the year before my grandpa called us evil democrats.
726.0,Provider,Oh.
12103.0,Patient,"And then, and he was really on mom and it was horrible how mom felt really horrible about because she was, and I was upset for mom. and the next day. She said something else, and he just pretended like he never said it."
726.0,Provider,Ah yeah.
12103.0,Patient,"I unfriended him on Facebook, because I can't play that game. I can't. continue to let it's like safe people I read the book safe people I really loved it because it showed me that. You know there's some things that had value in the program that I did and i'll talk about the program all the time i'll say the Program. But not everything they had that they taught us had value. for everyone, because it was too Christian based, but this safe people to see if people admit them stakes and apologize and try and change and get better and so. It takes I tried to admit that i'm wrong, but I get into that mindset of as well, where i'm like i'm not wrong i'm not wrong and i've done that a couple times in the last seven days, where it was like. Okay, that was a major overreaction we were just parking in a garage my sister was in the car with me. I thought to take the parking ticket with us and I just I upset her a lot, I could tell where I was like. And I didn't apologize for freaking out. But when we got back to the car I did say, and when we got out of the parking garage I said Why did I think that was so important, I don't. I don't understand why I thought that was so important um but but I realized that I didn't know the process so is admitting something, but I didn't I could have just said i'm sorry. And then to this family's like if you're gonna. Go back, I mean we just don't go back, we don't go back even though."
726.0,Provider,about family yeah I can't believe you me.
12103.0,Patient,"My family yeah and so. i'll probably call her today and say hey you know, last week, I just want to apologize for flipping out. um. And I think I did that yesterday to where I feel like i'm like in this zone of I gotta be right. Because I was playing a video game with a friend I connected with him and had a he bought me a game last weekend, and I was like but i've known him for like two years online and. I was like well he's got the money he wants to do it and it's a fun game and we've interacted on it now, and so we can and it's working better to get to know each other better. But I was like will do this do this do this last night, and I was like. Well then, I realized what I was doing and I was like up go ahead, do what you want to do you know i'm just i've tried it this way, but I realized, and I did admit that I realized that there's more than one way to do it and. I want to discover all those different ways to do it as well and i'm gonna go try different things. And so just kind of backing up. without having to come out sometimes because it feels really."
726.0,Provider,horrible maybe mean it feels.
12103.0,Patient,"Like in the moment it feels like if I apologize to this person. For being that way. I guess I do feel uncomfortable saying oh i'm sorry I was being bossy. yeah thing, but then again that's the kind of person, I want to be, I want to be able to say so, something I think is going on with me right now, where. i'm trying to be kind of controlling. and"
726.0,Provider,"feeling of like. Like the the interaction that you've had with your mom is it more of a feeling of wanting to feel safe that you want to control, because I think. I think you did a beautiful job of catching yourself on when it was happening. And I think you know, sometimes it's good like once something happens sometimes giving yourself that space to like mull it over for a little bit. gives you more clarity around that because, in the moment when when we're being a certain way in the moment it's a lot harder to be like able to see what was happening and what was the thing that was triggering moment so it's like. Like give yourself like you know how people say give yourself grace it's like give yourself grace for that, because I think that at least you, you are capable of looking at yourself in your way. of not being attached to you, but like of the situation really seeing it from all angles. So for you, what do you think it is about this past week, the husband feeling like you want to control things."
12103.0,Patient,"Well, I think the flip side right now i'm thinking. It was really vulnerable at those times. And to. The admitted that I wanted to be in control would have made me even more vulnerable. um. I guess it's kind of I don't want to say delicate I definitely felt emotional I saw something like. i'm like Sometimes I feel like i'm on the verge of crying like something else is going on. And so. It could be that that something else is going on, that i'm not. Really admitting to comfortable with. yeah and it's. kind of triggering me to be controlling um. And for my so I can see where so mom's not a safe person I wouldn't talk to her about it when her situation came up. sarah's a singer and my sister Sarah I would talk to her about it, my friend Alan doesn't really care so he and I will make a. joke out of it."
726.0,Provider,"Ah, OK."
12103.0,Patient,"So it'll be a joke i'm like Oh, and being bossy again do whatever you want. Which is really where I can call myself out without having to apologize, but the thing is, is that. um. i'd like to be more mature I could do that, I think I could do that just say to him, you know. um. Oh, I see I can't even put the words together."
726.0,Provider,"Okay. You know, when you said vulnerable It reminds me of like renee brown she cuz she talked so much about for validity. And one of the things that she was saying is like not everybody deserves but not not that they don't deserve not everybody is a person to. To be vulnerable with so be. There certain people once you can find the people in your life that you feel safe enough to be vulnerable with those are the people that you can say certain things to and. The nice thing is you already know that your mom it doesn't feel like a safe person to do that with and. You know, being able to identify that in your life and who are those people is actually very helpful and the fact that you're able to acknowledge that I was feeling vulnerable in that position at that moment. um and how how that shows up in other areas of your life, other than just with your sister Sarah at that moment that there's other ways of that may show up."
12103.0,Patient,"yeah. I feel like. That hypersensitivity I feel like i'm having a lot of that lately where. And it's been going on for a while, where everything is dissected. Over dissected because i'm. I feel like i'm doing the work, but the work takes a lot of energy, instead of easy, but I realized that. Like we had so there's the double bind but there's yeah and I. Think it's the double bind with doing the right thing. or doing the hard thing isn't. So there's the easy way in the hard way and you do the hard way because it's worth the work something like that um there's some slogan that i'm forgetting but it's definitely. feels like. Nothing is easy right now um. But i'm in that place I know i'm in the place where I want to do the work so there's that kind of that i'm not reminding myself wait, I signed up for this, I signed up to, not just live life as it came at me but to actually try and improve it. Other people didn't we try waste a lot of energy, I swear it's like, why are you talking to them about it, they don't want to improve their lives they don't care. They. they're comfortable in their mess i'm not comfortable in my mess. So, and I had I got a disabled paperwork review after two years. it's done but yesterday was hard, but then it's like. I realized that this is my job, so I don't have a job, but this is my job to get better I signed up, and this is what I do on a daily basis and the disability it's part of it. so that I can concentrate on getting better and functioning with people. The same because, like especially guys and it's that example with my friend Alan versus my friend rob my friend rob and I were kind of dating and that was really something I talked about. Before Christmas that I wanted to that I knew I was terrible communicator with him. And I went to a Christmas party at a new friends house and she helped me realize that I just needed to tell him. I couldn't do casual dating I needed him to be mine or not at all, and he chose not at all. And so, now I don't find myself thinking about i'm constantly i'm not there, my mind patterns, the functioning thinking patterns have changed. And now alan's kind of stepping into that role, but he's too young and I need to. communicate that as well, and so in telling him that I made a mistake that's more mature I can do that that's what I need to do still to be me. interacting with him as well, instead of making it a joke well and I can make it a joke. um. And that's The thing is kind of evaluating. Is it a friendship is it going to remain a friendship do my friendships need to mature, can I just enjoy him for who he is at his age. He wants to be a little more serious okay well if he wants to be a little more serious, then, and he finds me attractive and even though i'm 20 years this senior so, then I need to act one years and senior and tell him I apologize for being bossy because that's a mature thing to do. So i'm like because I was, I was working it out, I was working it out. yeah that if it's relationships it's really relationships. If I want to have. The relationship as it lays and the relationship as it just floats by itself fine. But if I actually care and i've given him my real information it's taken me two years but we're friends on Facebook now. You know friends on steam, which is the game console thing and so it's like i'm. Okay i'm going to really be honest with them and help them realize those being bossy and. i'm I don't want to be that way I don't want to be that kind of friend if I was friends with him in real life it'd be apologizing so i'm friends with him in real life i'm apologizing and finding out some place in my life that I want to improve so he can call me on it kindly. And so that's what I would do with a real friend, so I need to treat him like a real friend."
726.0,Provider,"christy because you you've been working on yourself, for as long as you have it's it's also this thing it's like the more you work on yourself and become aware of your own patterns in your own behaviors it's like. Certain certain people that you've known for a certain amount of time. If you've been doing a lot of work, that means that your relationships to have that ripple effect on relationships, where. You may need something different from different people as you evolve yourself as a person, so the more you work on yourself, the more you start to see the distortions or the. Or the things that just don't match up to you, like maybe you feel like you're at that moment, too, so it's so much as like like giving yourself that space to. to know that you can be in process of working on yourself and knowing at the same time, that your relationships around you and the people that you interact with. Those interactions can also change, as you yourself evolve and heal yourself, because things that didn't bother you before as. May bother you later on once you've done more work on yourself and you're just like oh that just doesn't match up with with what what I value now for myself, I might have not valued that before, but now I value X, Y Z. And so it's not so much either that there's anything wrong with you as a person it's more like okay you're working on yourself so certain things are just not gonna you're not going to connect with them in the same way as you did before. And so you know."
12103.0,Patient,"What and i've in the past when things didn't connect with them. there's a lot of friends that I think I didn't bother to try and go back to in evolve, the friendship relationship. I have ditched a lot of friendships without giving it second chances, even though i've given some people that shouldn't be given second chances second, third, fourth chances. And I like I feel like I have very like my best friend from high school drum corps. lives in yeah Come on, and then my best friend from college. When I was married lives in the tri cities and. Then this guy. Is a good friend lays a good friend, but I have to do the same kind of defining I react right interact with him more. Because like Crystal and I crystals aren't even on Facebook margaret's on Facebook, but she's got two kids crystal sick right now with coven. And we just like we text each other very rarely it's a big deal that she's sick and we're texting more, but we can go three months without even talking to each other, so those relationships kind of hold space. And don't evolve well, but I can bring in new things when I see here next to bring in new things we adapt really well to the new things i've learned. um we both come in with like i've been in counseling she's been in counseling and we're doing counseling concurrently separate and so will come in and gets us each other, after the pandemic and both be excited about the changes that we've been making in our own lives. and So the friendship is evolving does evolve Margaret and I same thing she's. It evolves differently as well. So. But there's a lot of friendships, though, where it was like I made an early judgment call or I didn't bother to invest the time. Or, like, I have a hobby group i'm in the SCA which is society for creative anachronism I don't know if you know who they are, and i'm so in my local group. there's people that um there's manipulators some manipulators, and so my boundaries with them are really hard but it made me not trust the entire group of people. And so i'm trying not to just wipe it all away i'm trying to just keep it going realize there's other people that i'm going to meet. realize that there's friendships. I guess I kind of have to treat the group as the friendship, instead of the individual people's at this point because I have one friend i'm wanting to be in a relationship with. She and I keep trying to meet up for coffee we're very similar we see each other on Facebook, but the real life interaction and waiting for that to evolve. Without Robin the situation. He was he was there, the last time we had a conversation and i'm looking forward to just her and I. Getting to be friends, because rob brought us together as friends, we met each other that way through rob but now rob's not the most important piece of that anymore, she has value to me as a friend, we have a lot in common so. And I get so wrapped up in it, like, I was so wrapped up in I needed rob as a friend, he is a friend it didn't mess us up to be in a relationship. And instead of having to talk to him about the really deep things as to why I can't be with him or I feel like i'm not in a place to be dating I just realized that I can't have those conversations with him so that's not the type of relationship that i'm going to have with him. yeah save those in depth relationships, like, I never shared my past with him, and when I shared some abuse of things that I dealt with, I didn't felt feel like. They were. acknowledged, or even remember remembered so. That consigned to that friendship to surface superficial."
726.0,Provider,And yeah yeah.
12103.0,Patient,"And so I want to keep that one. Because look I can keep it I need to be able to keep relationships with men that's not sexual and do that so there's a goal. yeah and then just keep plodding along with other friendships and I was friends with a couple and they moved to Alabama. I think she was in the room for my comfort, but he really helped me with this group and understanding the group dynamics understanding some prejudices that they had put on me. and gossip that was going around behind my back so. Okay, and i've been gossiped about before like. and that's I think that's why I find it tough but I don't find it tough like I love group therapy on a weekly on a weekly basis, I really love it. yeah and I can see the same faces. But I could sit there and yammer for hours with these people and we're not there we're not there for that and so. I don't really know them deeper and that's Okay, but when I did it in real life, I shared and no one was supposed to share outside of the group, what I had said."
726.0,Provider,"Yes, you're not into gossip like she took the story that I told she."
12103.0,Patient,"told someone else. yeah someone else's my friend. The mouse is my friend and she became terrified of me, but a couple weeks later, she got brave and she said hey somebody said you're a witch. I said number one I told the story of living with wiccans. yeah i'm in the counseling that was not supposed to come out of group counseling so we're going to go talk to a counselor and tell them that."
726.0,Provider,that's what you were asked yeah I this person and this person is broken protocol.
12103.0,Patient,"and up to this is the real story and I told her the. Was. yeah she's like you really are a good person and i'm she was, but she moved out like a week later, but. And so that's where. i'm i've had a really hard time in this group because. i'm coming in and i'm disabled and there's things I can't do and it's an outdoor camping group I just had so many difficulties and."
726.0,Provider,i'm like i'm. A ta.
12103.0,Patient,"Okay yeah and then I taught myself how to weave when I was sick at home for six weeks and kind of go to their events. yeah, then I came back and I had value to them suddenly and i'm like that I disagree with that because. i'm Christian i'm struggling with my Christianity, but the thing about it is, I know that number one I deserve grace, which I forget a lot number two. I have value because i'm a human being."
726.0,Provider,"Yes, yes, you do yeah."
12103.0,Patient,"And that's it and don't treat me that way they see me as oh suddenly she's serious which I take serious is value has value to the group because she's this amazing person who can weave and it's like now, I put weaving number one for my hands but number two just to spite them. Because and that's wrong that I know that's wrong, I need to do what I enjoy. and and see with them, I want to talk to every single person that comes up to me and says that's amazing weaving and I want to say, but i'm an amazing person because i'm here if I wasn't weaving i'd still want you to come talk to me. Because yeah value, because you are here and so."
726.0,Provider,"yeah well, I have a question about that is it. Like if we think about you know where things may come from in the way that we we live in, with up our perspective is in the world. Like in your own childhood, was it that that you were not valued as just being a person or was it more like you have to you have to show up or do something to. The value around you. Other people. Because it could also be something about like. there's something to be said it's like when we go into group dynamics and. And it's it's like this subconscious level it's like sometimes or recreate what we haven't healed yet and so. I wonder if the triggered the the part of you that feels that resentment that anger towards House to do that it's hitting a nerve with something else deeper than just that group."
12103.0,Patient,"OK, so the story goes that my nickname on gmail is middle F medals at gmail."
726.0,Provider,uh huh.
12103.0,Patient,My mom and dad are both middle children. i'm the middle child and middle children. i'm in that's my superpower.
726.0,Provider,wasn't there.
12103.0,Patient,I am invisible.
726.0,Provider,Ah.
12103.0,Patient,"OK, because I know middle I know the child hierarchy is that. Okay, and don't see seen be feel seen and i've seen that behavior in both of my parents my father's my father's they wanted to see schizo Franek but he walked away from the family 20 years ago and probably committed suicide. And so I only have 40 years the dad only had 4540 years 45 years and. And then, like, I was born in 75 he was born in 52, and so there was only so much interaction between him and I, but I have to judge him on but mom."
726.0,Provider,yeah.
12103.0,Patient,"she's definitely a narcissist. Okay comes first, because nobody puts her first. To this day. yeah, and so I have actually gotten a call from her going why aren't you at a family event and i'm like what are you talking about there's no family event today not gotten called. And so, and then mom's considered the black sheep of the family she's democrat well i'm purple because i'm worse than her when it comes to being liberal i'm very poor. yeah it's made my interactions with family difficult but i'm an amazing person. Do not I just I know very proudly that i'm an amazing person childhood let's talk about childhood okay middle child younger sister older sibling older sibling has an IQ of higher than mine and minus 168. She skipped A grade in third grade when we were in portland I saw her, she was miserable I. was so bored. When I was before I was in school and nobody would pay attention to me, so I would daydream and what I was doing is just associating and going to this plane world, whereas this giant flat plane. So when I disassociate I go to the giant flat plane and when i'm really struggling which I haven't disassociated since 2019. right before I right as I started cmdr like I did it once and then I started mtr and I stopped doing it, and I was like I missed that worry because, like ever really active dream life, and I have pocket worlds I swear."
726.0,Provider,"Beautiful that's. quality. that's a great quality oh my God, you know how good that is an empty our work to have that. That that's good."
12103.0,Patient,"Well, and this week. within seven days I had a dream, where it was really traumatic I didn't get up okay got upset but I started to have them long long voice, which is when i'm trying to speak in the real world, one sleeping I didn't do 100% with that more voice in. The dream I said. that's my stuff it was my art I had created it someone was trying to steal it I said no it's mine and then I went behind their back and took it I brought in authority the authority dealt with them, I got my art and so back put it away where. It can be taken thing is, is it was art in this pocket world that I had created in this pocket world, so this art exists in this pocket world which is really amazing but. Okay, so going back to childhood, I really want to tell you this because, so I would daydream all the time, and it was because I was intelligent I wasn't getting enough simulation. and She couldn't keep up with my older sister, I think, so how is she going to know I mean I didn't even compare like amy she just graduated two weeks ago with her MBA from Copenhagen university she was homeless run away with a six to 16 she was a mom."
726.0,Provider,wow.
12103.0,Patient,"teen I was an answer because, and then I became a mom to her child at 14 because she didn't want to be a mom she's. She wanted to go out and party so i'd go to her house and babysit, and so the piece of lot there's a lot to unpack there but. She skipped A grade third grade I thought I saw it as like oh that's not good, I don't want to deal with that, let me just pull things back to average I pulled it off okay I pulled off average fifth grade mom and dad separated and. My comfort was schoolwork I got straight a's and fifth grade. Okay, they saw me, and it was terrible because they had me take an IQ test they put me in a special April, it was called able learners program made me, instead of being the top of the heap getting a's. And we moved from portland to spokane so I was a year ahead and violin so I had to have a special violin teacher with search me out of class I was one day a week pulled me out of class to go to able learners. So I was special but not in a good way and I no longer connected with my peers and kids I didn't I had a couple friends and then the next year I got my very first bully. And I was sitting in the principles in the office waiting for the principal she had pulled my hair I think so hard that I had slugged her, finally, that I was being abused at home by my older sister. And I don't remember a lot of the interactions when I was in. I remember being tied to a chair once sock stuffed in my mouth and she got in trouble for that one because I let them do it, I just wanted to play with them so bad I let them do it. But there was another time they had me on the ground, my little sister says we had her on the ground, we were kicking and I don't remember that, but I kind of do."
726.0,Provider,That Sarah.
12103.0,Patient,"My little sister Sarah says, because she was the cohort because she didn't want to be the victim."
726.0,Provider,"Oh, I see oh."
12103.0,Patient,She knew that if she. didn't go along with what amy did I was a victim and amy will never talk about this she refuses she's so.
726.0,Provider,Much have.
12103.0,Patient,"she's trying to hope oh yeah she was trying to cope, and I understand that as an adult. And I."
726.0,Provider,want to get to the child self is still like.
12103.0,Patient,"she's like. I have secrets i'm not going to tell anybody, but then, and all this is going on in this bully pulled my hair and I. was sitting there she had pulled my hair so hard on top of my head that I had done something maybe I pushed her so hard I don't remember I just I knew I had to make it stop because it hurts so bad. So I ended up in the principal's office, and so did sheet and I went like this with my hair kind of went like this to brush my hair back. My hair's falling out. So I stopped I didn't move I knew my parents weren't going to do anything, because we have other things in the past. mom and dad interacting with the school they'd rather tell me what to do and to me to go to school, until the teachers until the principal. So I was like I know I gotta take care of myself went into the principal's office because it's my turn to talk to him and he starts talking to me and I go she pulled my hair. She pulled my hair and I was just pulling the hair out just played it up, because I knew that was the only way, he was going to take me seriously I had told them for weeks that she was beating me at this. at school and they were supposed to protect me from her and they hadn't and so now finally he had damaged me enough that I could prove to them that she was bad because she was just a sweetheart in public, but she was in violin with me, we were both advanced students and she was jealous. So um whenever I needed help from my mom or from adults, I didn't get it. So I learned how to do it and. So, in the same way of I wanted to play trumpet the amy was playing trumpet so I had to play violin That was all that was open to me. And Sarah even didn't even get to pick one we were really poor you know, and so we just. I mean well I don't I don't. I don't know why I didn't pick nothing but anyway. So there was. I didn't want to be seen, I didn't want to be seen a lot of times and then I. amy brought a boyfriend home. And because suddenly she wasn't at the school with me anymore, because I came into junior high and she'd been in high school and her boyfriend came home and he thought I was more beautiful than her. And that I knew was the worst thing he could have done because she had been abusive and so she got really mad and I don't know when she ran away around that, but that was my new story was you're so beautiful guys just value you for sex. and keep my virginity until 17. You know, but that was and made it my choice, but I knew that my value was in my appearance, I was even competition for my mother. And so I still am like oh so this fat suit you see here. Is camouflage I am safer with camouflage on."
726.0,Provider,Which okay.
12103.0,Patient,"cold because Alan I can take my teeth out. Alan doesn't care. yeah and. I just so it's been. Is it safer to not be seen and then I realized. When I was married. That I was his sex toy that was it, I still didn't have value as a person, I had value as thing. And I, the reason I left my marriage is I was either going to kill him or kill me. I didn't want to die I didn't want to go to jail I left."
726.0,Provider,My loan.
12103.0,Patient,"Because it was, and then I got into the program and that's when I realized his his life, I mean I knew he was a sex addict and alcoholic. I knew that like he'd come home from work and get on the computer looking at porn that was it that was our life so if I wasn't in the mood I better keep my body prepped in the mood because he could come at me at any time, and he had like insert and we're good to go. Now horrible so. When I left I realized that people's thoughts don't revolve around sex people's bring don't revolve around sex because we get other things accomplished we've gone to the moon. So. yeah it's been this huge revelation but, in the same way it's that pendulum swing of. I thought about sex all the time, too, I don't think about sex at all, and now i'm trying to find this middle ground really. Quick romances I really enjoy the hope. yeah."
726.0,Provider,And nothing wrong with that.
12103.0,Patient,"But the sex. that's what we're going to work on is. What what can be normal when do I feel like normal you know. Because my counselor before was well don't read it don't read the sex some don't read about the relationship and i'm just like but there's one author. Who she's been through a lot of things like i've been through and she talks, they have a conversation in the book about and they talk about improving their selves and their own trauma and so these examples of conversations how I can do life. differently, we. Are in the book and I was learning things and so it's been really helpful. yeah, and so the same way of. of thinking about. How do I i'm I knew I had to break it off with rob because it was thinking about how. To talk to them about I don't enjoy the sexual interactions and i'm not telling you how to touch me in any of those things I didn't feel like talking about those things, and so I realize that that I get into that."
726.0,Provider,"It didn't sound like you would have been receptive either, though. If he was just on his own agenda, I don't think. I think, even if you try it doesn't sound like he would have."
12103.0,Patient,"wanted it. He was in a relationship it's in a relationship with another lady who is married and it's paulie and it's complicated and. I knew to feel comfortable I needed to have him not in a relationship with someone else, so he could listen to what I was saying, and I would feel respected for that, because my ex basically cheated on me every day of his life with people on the Internet. yeah and then, when he actually cheated on me he married her."
726.0,Provider,yeah.
12103.0,Patient,"after divorce. yeah it was 10 years like she was she's 10 years younger, we were in college in 2000 yeah it was 10 years after that he had cheated on me I stayed with him after the cheating and said Okay, but not again and it turns out there was plenty of again trying he had ED so. It was not great ever and. So. She pursued him and he didn't say no, and so, then after I left anyway um."
726.0,Provider,"So when you said that it's not just added to that part, but he wanted to work on what is it specifically about it, is it finding what would be preview the healthiest version of what sex is as an understanding one."
12103.0,Patient,"Well, I need to. Talk about. Like I couldn't even talk about. Like I can throw out the abuses that I. felt suffered experienced with my ex. And what i'm doing in the books as i'm retraining my brain that this is not his behavior was not average."
726.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
12103.0,Patient,"Is it was. extraordinarily abusive. and trying to go okay that's not loving that's not loving that's not loving and so. Being able to and even, in some of the books that she's not expressing her needs like i'm reading stuff that's probably too close to erotica where he's just doing whatever because he knows how to seduce her but it's more about her talking about her needs. yeah cuz guys can't magically know it. yeah oh that's were talking about like with."
726.0,Provider,missy it's not. A dream to see.
12103.0,Patient,"Oh totally I couldn't even tell him. don't touch me, you have to touch me like this, not like that you have to kiss me like this, not like that. And I just quit talking about those things. yeah boom, you know we moved really."
726.0,Provider,quickly.
12103.0,Patient,Through foreplay but we at least had some and it was like there's i'm not even communicating is so because the abusive part.
726.0,Provider,"For the connection that i'm seeing with how you were talking about you know what happened with your sister amy and then with this it's like. it's almost like. I wonder if you know, once we start through a process and work of of these memories is if you're connecting sex and intimacy. And there's this underlying guilt or feeling like of feelings of guilt based on. What happened with amy and her boyfriend in this thing with the mom too, because I mean when you think about like there is there is emotional love and there's emotional intimacy and then there's like having sexual intimacy and so it's like. it's in it's this big spectrum and so there's there's physical and then there's it's loaded like it's like sex and relationships and having sexual relationships may be loaded with guilt coming all the way down from childhood, because you were you wanted to be invisible right. And it's easier to like hide yourself and hide your own needs to make other people happy because it almost sounds like you've been conforming. For other people around you, and so, whatever your needs are it's exploring deeper into what those are for you, because if you're not thinking about. These people that you're trying to to keep at a safe distance and you're trying to not create conflict with them What would it be like, if you like, just thought about all the things that you want it for yourself because i'm thinking to it's like. Most likely if let's say your ex husband was watching porn he was probably just watching the stuff that uh you know, like that doesn't discuss consent or that's not actually what I think. The reality, or even what someone wants."
12103.0,Patient,"We had moved to the point of. chat rooms web cameras, so he was. Getting what he wanted. Exactly what do you want it yeah but, but I feel like there's this mindset of people who do that because I found that mindset of do whatever I can to get attention. Even if it's negative attention, but that is the only way that you have value is as a sex thing and so doing what someone else says. You know, you can disconnect from the abuse of."
726.0,Provider,yeah.
12103.0,Patient,"I don't really want to do this, I don't want to be valued in this way. And you convince yourself that you enjoy exposing yourself. yeah doing things yourself at their their demand."
726.0,Provider,"christy I would I mean and I don't know how this will sound like, but there is also there's a pocket out there of women creators that are creating. content online that is like more feminist and like i'm in the way that it's like like it's it's more of a reality of probably what a woman would enjoy watching rather than what is just massively produced out there on on. online, but I think I think, the more we were, I think it's important to start working. on finding and exploring more what it is that you want without the fear of getting in someone else's making someone else feel uncomfortable and so just exploring what emotional intimacy would be because it doesn't sound like maybe you have that with your ex husband either."
12103.0,Patient,"um yeah I don't I don't think so either yeah because i'm. Well, and it's like there's all the emotions and then there's the sexual emotions and. So not having permission like from childhood."
726.0,Provider,You talk to him.
12103.0,Patient,"So I hate it that's what dad said he talked about, and so. Being quiet. And that you know crying too much they said I cried too much, well, I felt emotions and I wasn't allowed to feel those emotions, so those i'm still function, I think, in a lot of ways, like i've been told within the past year don't don't cry too much you're gonna make yourself sick. And so. yeah yeah it's there's I do understand that there's a lot of of emotional stuff that's just shut down, and I feel like I have. I feel, on occasion, that I have abnormally large emotions, I know that's not true, I have emotions. and other people are uncomfortable with them."
726.0,Provider,"Yes, yes. exactly like, if you think like even in your own family is nothing is addressed, then they don't have the tools or skills, because they've never tried to actually like practice what it's like to feel something. And so I think that's the helpful part that I find in processing is that you can intellectually know something in your brain you understand it emotionally you still feel like you can't do it, even though you. know it like for you it's like. Right oh my body. And my account rejecting it."
12103.0,Patient,"Well, I told my last counselor I told her I just feel like I need to cry all the time, but and she gave me permission to how to cry and then I didn't feel like I needed."
726.0,Provider,it's like yeah.
12103.0,Patient,"And and that's where, and I do know that the anger and I know we're running out of time, but the anger that comes out because I don't express that emotions that I am so then it gets to the point where. else and that's all you get you just get cuss words, and this is too intense and mom can't handle me and I don't need to go to mass. yeah yeah i'm the only person who's allowed to get angry. i'm not allowed to get angry."
726.0,Provider,"yeah. Well christy our next appointment will be on February 4 because I. have done that. So um I I want you too. If you put right. Start journaling. yeah how's it as a kid because there's a lot there, but I do acknowledge that we can't tackle everything at once it's going to be little pieces, at a time. And one of the big things is um, how can we first what were, if you were to make a list of mom dad sisters right. Right, what are the emotions associated with each person. good or bad just making a list of when I think of. Sarah. These are the things i've come up for me or, these are the emotions that I feel and write it down unfiltered. And if you're if you don't feel comfortable writing them down because you live in the same space with your mom oh. No i'm sorry about it."
12103.0,Patient,"I told my sister when I die to burn burn burn journalist because that's where my best journals are just full of hatred, because I can't express it. yeah but then i've expressed it and I don't feel that way. got it on paper so okay."
726.0,Provider,"i'll do that and then and then we'll we'll continue and then we're going to do more like. mtr skills to help you regulate emotion, because one of those are the ones, those are one of the biggest things before processing, I think, because if you get overwhelmed we're flooded with emotion for. or memories. And it's like your brain. will protect itself, and it will just shut down. So that's why I say we want to go at a piece, at a time, because if. You try it'll be."
12103.0,Patient,"way same way as. I write it down because, even after sharing what i've shared today. If I try and think back about what I shared I can feel that I can get like I can lose the homework. yeah so yeah. All right. I do so, Maria she oh. yeah good to see you."
726.0,Provider,"yeah. All right, all right i'll See you in two weeks."
12103.0,Patient,"Alright sounds good, thank."
726.0,Provider,You I.
