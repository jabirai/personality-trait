2583.0,Patient,"um I hadn't I had today yeah my Internet. was having issues when I use it again like it 15 minutes before group starts. Just that I have time to get. Up yeah. I did that and. For some reason I kept getting kicked out and I added later on my regular phone service, so I couldn't connect for just my phone. So I kept getting kicked out, and I would get back then, and it would be choppy but then it would go off again and so. On I was at myself i'm trying to get into group. Our hands on to our Internet provider and found out that yes, they were having issues that they were already in the process of collecting it."
431.0,Provider,got it.
2583.0,Patient,"I. got to the point where me and said the host will let you and you know. Whatever it. ended up being like maybe 10 minutes, maybe a couple minutes last. 15 Minutes that you know they give you to get into."
431.0,Provider,Now yeah yeah.
2583.0,Patient,"That I actually got fixed and I was actually able to get in there. yeah and I sat and sat outside and i'm a compliant and I explained to them, you know what was going on and that I had been sitting in there, you know waiting like it said for those but you know it just never did. So that's why I logged off. Back to compliant so."
431.0,Provider,Wait tanya you put yourself on mute. hold on what happened.
2583.0,Patient,"bread and. i've been dealing with this big math because i'm on bi weekly and monthly script well there's been a couple people who have not been reading my chart. And reading the little notes in there that say that I would you know switch to bi weekly group so they were non compliance, because I wasn't going to group every day, every week, and so I was getting bridged, for which I should not have been doing and. then read scripts for the time and. then explain like i'm doing everything that i'm supposed to do either my screen packages were not coming. up like conference. Just. getting them. is just a hassle for me and it's. So frustrating. Because of my my. My file. Because it's too it's too much. And it's this type of stress that, like get those thoughts in my head like i'm done go back to doing what I was doing and leave it at that and just."
431.0,Provider,Like.
2583.0,Patient,me when it comes to me doing what i'm supposed to winning that's the type of stuff that. Because. I wasn't seeing it.
431.0,Provider,got it.
2583.0,Patient,"And I don't know what to do, i've talked to everybody that I mean that they connect me to and i'm not necessarily that I plan. yeah."
431.0,Provider,"So Okay, you told a bunch of information, I just wanted to confirm, I understand, and it definitely sounds super frustrating. How it's gone down. From what I can hear you try to communicate with everybody what you need to do yeah Oh, but it seems like. there's either the system was not did not receive the correct information, so you kept getting penalized. For things. So. let's let's your. Oh, can you hear me okay amen."
2583.0,Patient,On that yeah i'm sorry my daughter. you're fine.
431.0,Provider,"Oh Okay, I want to give you. Finish so what's your therapy appointment, so you do not see a therapist with them right heart is that."
2583.0,Patient,"Correct, no, no, but I was talking to Isaiah. yeah my last appointment about switching back and. I was saying Maggie and she. Had a special was a. busy."
431.0,Provider,thought it.
2583.0,Patient,was the last time I seen her it would have been like three four months before she would have had another opening here.
431.0,Provider,yeah that's hard to work.
2583.0,Patient,"Like once every. Three months, if not."
431.0,Provider,And yeah. So it didn't work also you will be.
2583.0,Patient,penalized and you.
431.0,Provider,"got it. So that I just want to clarify, but I don't see you scheduled for any therapy appointment anyway So hopefully. That has not decided, an issue with your medication appointments you're saying you, you are you go to twice a month every other week."
2583.0,Patient,"i'm on biweekly groups, and I am i've been on monthly prescription since Dr natalie was with."
431.0,Provider,"Well, I think so. yeah yeah yeah."
2583.0,Patient,"I mean I that I was on with him and. That whole mishap with them not reading my chart. folio and seeing about the therapy and all that. So that's what i've been on bridges i've gotten like maybe two or three monthly scripts. And it's been really good, because nobody cares to read my chart early."
431.0,Provider,"yeah I mean obviously take some time to like like even for me you're new to me. I would have to do better reading but give me one second let them we're going to do is actually log into the Ohio State like medication monitoring as you're aware aware the. medications are monitored by the state. So I let me pull it up just to kind of get a better sense of the history, about how much you've been getting filled. don't give me a sector."
2583.0,Patient,Because I see I see I might we've been dealing with coven.
431.0,Provider,yeah sure.
2583.0,Patient,"I was, I know I had missed a group or whatever, because i've been in hospital. And being in there obviously I had same thing I, for some reason, this new hospital that we have the wi fi doesn't like to stay connected in there."
431.0,Provider,Sometimes a hospital wi fi so.
2583.0,Patient,"I. contacted them to give you guys a heads up but it doesn't always work that way. Sure, as soon as I got in the first thing I do is contact you like, I am on it when it comes to."
431.0,Provider,"For I think I appreciate your efforts, I hear you're that you're really trying, and you have been with us for a long time. So, because so it looks like you weren't able to make to group last week because of possible state."
2583.0,Patient,With your daughter I wouldn't have to have group last week.
431.0,Provider,Today i'm.
2583.0,Patient,glad that they would have been my normal group because of Internet I got 10 minutes late and the man. they're saying that's now i'm a non compliant with it.
431.0,Provider,"Okay, so that makes sense because you're in last persecution wait hold on, let me it was."
2583.0,Patient,"He prescribed me two weeks. Because i've seen him on a one on one because, being in the hospital. On that group you've done enough to get me to this group and sad when I got when I came to group that would go back and I would start my monthly one because I got my drug screen and everything and everything was good. To go back to my monthly prescriptions and by any you know completing my bye week groups."
431.0,Provider,Okay okay so Isaiah had said.
2583.0,Patient,"You know. That, at my last my last one on one with him i'm not sure what that."
431.0,Provider,"Money yeah I miss. him on the 27th yup you're right and that was let me pull up the notes tab know is available. Because what I so all right, so what I can do, obviously, is, I can definitely get a bridge prescription in for you that's not a problem, the constraints that I have is that I do have to follow our program requirements and. that you mentioned, because of the Miss label of scheduling right now it's telling me, you know to only give you so much. Without a like seeing a note from Isaiah clearly stating that you can go back to a monthly supply, I will need to verify with them before I can do that or."
2583.0,Patient,yeah that's the thing I keep I keep getting told by like I said somebody in the navigation with everybody knows in my chart. And then I find out later that there is none other than that.
431.0,Provider,"I know, with the notes situation I hear you sometimes like you're not the first patient who said, like oh that. writer and I talked about it and then. You know what I because I wasn't there, I have to verify and some place right because trust me some people are way more creative than I am. I just. need to also be you know trust, but verify, so let me see the notes, he did put a note for the your visit on the 27th. All right, I think this know says to continue as prescribed if that's not helpful with a duration is it. Right and and you know we so the doctors don't write it all down every single detail know they they transcribe it they actually say. Somebody writes it, and so it potentially could be a mist detail. Might let me see. And I am looking on okay I don't see it in. 27 I do see. Your film history Okay, so you got a two week supply again. Today, from last."
2583.0,Patient,And then before that it was just a bridge because. yeah it was like a whole.
431.0,Provider,Little seven day four day. And prior to that was. A day. or four weeks supply okay. yeah.
2583.0,Patient,"This is bad, I had gotten. mad because he. knew that back up to three and that's when I got the last month month prescription."
431.0,Provider,"Yes, so this this was basically what I see happen 30 on like a midwife."
2583.0,Patient,And alive and then right after that is when the whole care of itself.
431.0,Provider,"Right so in July, you got a month supply last year till August, and then there were some bridges, accounting for the hospital state. got it and then the most recent one from. August was."
2583.0,Patient,Right. on track.
431.0,Provider,"yeah so things add up what my question to you is, since you weren't able to call into group today."
2583.0,Patient,"I will text Russia, and I was talking to. My group."
431.0,Provider,Your group therapist.
2583.0,Patient,"And I explained it to her, you know everything."
431.0,Provider,yeah.
2583.0,Patient,So she said that she was going to talk to I. heard back from her yet. Time butting heads with. me he gets hot. Usually. I usually do contact her through yeah. What are also.
431.0,Provider,"What I can so basically getting you a bridge prescriptions, not an issue right now, so our do you think you will be able to attend a group next week or."
2583.0,Patient,yeah.
431.0,Provider,yeah.
2583.0,Patient,"Every now and then every week. Just to bed go. Okay, you know that extra group. Then I was told that by doing that it's going to take the end of the system, but I am that I am in there every week so then, if I mess up i'm going to count against me now is that true. Next week, just to let you know back on track that, then I will probably go to the. Because that would be my regular group and continue their bi weekly."
431.0,Provider,"Okay, I."
2583.0,Patient,read that mess things up.
431.0,Provider,"yeah so what you just explained to me makes sense. To a human brain, I think the issue might be where the computer brain. is not as smart So the first issue that I see right now it's that in our system and then recently went through an update, so you may happen on a bi weekly frequency. Because of the recent update it kind of reset of people to weekly which has kind of baseline for everyone. might be the first issue that I just need to make sure Isaiah updates it because I think he's so. hard. To have my key frequency so with a biweekly frequency than the computer basically will see it say you know tanya came in this today, so the next time it's. In two weeks right. In the context of you, showing up into. One one in between just because you know you get something out of the groups. which I. Say and that's totally fine. I don't know if the computer than. Like puts you on the other week schedule, you know what I mean."
2583.0,Patient,"Well then, it doesn't matter, you would have showed up anyways I don't think it matters, the bi weekly. Group. is going to read."
431.0,Provider,It shouldn't do that because of the way. I OK.
2583.0,Patient,I will them next week. And then just do bi weekly from there just to make it easier.
431.0,Provider,yeah I think so.
2583.0,Patient,"Yes, reset my weekly."
431.0,Provider,"I think so, if you can go to group next week, because this week, there are some issues that will be. What I will need to actually ask is actually reset the the way its internal system now so that it actually reflects bi weekly if he feels like that's the frequency that you're stable on. Okay, so I it's so that's something that's out of my control it just has to be set by a provider. Maybe not. As far as your bridge prescription I do need to reach out to Isaiah because I can do one of two things right now. I can give you a week supply pursuant to your next appointment that I can do that without asking Isaiah. to your point if. If you. If he and you had agreed on a. Different quantity. Then, when he has approval So what do you want me to do, I can give you a week supply right now just for you to go to next week's appointment and then I say. Your regular script. um now you don't have to wait. Or you want me to reach out to Isaiah and say hey it sounds like you guys have discussed about going back to monthly. Is if he approves it then I can call it for a monthly supply."
2583.0,Patient,"Because my prescription. After tonight, I will have none."
431.0,Provider,"Okay, so it shouldn't take well, I mean I should be able to get a result by today I believe Isaiah is on again he may not get back like right the second, but he should. Have right now, you have What was your last dose."
2583.0,Patient,My roster those was. About 1215.
431.0,Provider,"All right, yeah it's 1215 and then you are on the BP morphine meloxicam ash to tablet Is that correct, yes, so tall 15. And then you have one more tab let. US okay for tonight. No issues with with girls sometimes."
2583.0,Patient,Okay now.
431.0,Provider,"got it. and obviously we don't want. You to get it, so I follow. So so here's what I can do, I can reach out to Isaac about the. Well, approved for a longer. I will let him know that you will attend group next week."
2583.0,Patient,"yeah and then I tried to do that yeah sure, and then."
431.0,Provider,In case I don't hear back from him because he may be today is Thursday.
2583.0,Patient,I actually have to depend on what.
431.0,Provider,Is group schedules are. If he doesn't get back to me. Let me see what time does your pharmacy close kroger's right.
2583.0,Patient,Because at nine o'clock tonight. Okay i'm fine.
431.0,Provider,"yeah yeah yeah, but I also do don't. want to call into late because I kind of raised my. Flags with us when we're doing this like."
2583.0,Patient,That i've had it was like 730 at night.
431.0,Provider,"I think so that's generally, what are kind of like loose guideline again not to like raise flags unnecessarily for. So. If I don't hear back from him by I would say. You know 5pm your time. Then I may just call it and and for. i'll let you know if I. go in a week supply just so that you. Are out does that sound like a workable plan for you. Yes, okay um but again I will keep you posted. If that's the case. And then that. At that time, I can only again, I can only do a week supply."
2583.0,Patient,And then.
431.0,Provider,"Get the additional but. i'll text I they have, for now, so let me just verify really quick, so I see your pharmacy right now is the kroger's on and Troy."
2583.0,Patient,"Is that right, yes, yes."
431.0,Provider,And you are on three times a day.
2583.0,Patient,"Yes, Okay, and I also am do, for we have my dad at one."
431.0,Provider,"Oh Okay, is that something that Isaiah usually for you. Okay hold on, let me write down so gabba. And that was filled on 737 15 for a month oh yeah you. Wake up."
2583.0,Patient,yeah I took them as needed.
431.0,Provider,Oh OK.
2583.0,Patient,"Because it's my father. So I try not to take them like every, not just in my body doesn't get me into them, so I picked them my last, then I need to unless it's not then I do take them the recommended dosage."
431.0,Provider,"got it so right now I see establishment on. 301 capsule twice a day is what you have. Yes, okay."
2583.0,Patient,yeah story.
431.0,Provider,"All right, you know gabapentin was."
2583.0,Patient,Pretty useful because.
431.0,Provider,they're taking a baby those. and actually does a pretty good job of kind of. calmed down a nurse. I would almost advice that. Taking it.
2583.0,Patient,twice a day can use flare ups.
431.0,Provider,I don't know.
2583.0,Patient,i've been on for a while I used to get them. Three times a day. But when I started with Dr jamison she did it twice a day so.
431.0,Provider,Now you're not hiding.
2583.0,Patient,"While you're running from three data to bed, I was it wasn't enough. So that's why i've kind of tried to cut back and not take them everywhere, just so they would last longer. nicely man is my only choice."
431.0,Provider,Right I don't know if I.
2583.0,Patient,were to put it back up to three times a day so that's why I kind of just like spread it out more.
431.0,Provider,yeah so with gabapentin I I typically I feel like it works well with nerf are needed pain if.
2583.0,Patient,Yes.
431.0,Provider,yeah and that those you're on again is not. High at all there's. room to go off do you have any issues with dizziness or.
2583.0,Patient,A bad MED as.
431.0,Provider,An actor you.
2583.0,Patient,drive enough nothing.
431.0,Provider,yeah so that is actually one of the biggest side effects for gabapentin but otherwise you know people can take up to like 900 milligrams three times a day and.
2583.0,Patient,Okay. They can tolerate never had never had an issue it's worth right.
431.0,Provider,"i'm not saying you need to that high of a dose. Obviously, those possible but it just giving you an idea of the range."
2583.0,Patient,right back. out and I. know that perfect he leads are really bad. back. i've not have anything to.
431.0,Provider,prepare for me so ibuprofen definitely the over the counter stuff does work I.
2583.0,Patient,"Just I have stomach issues, so I have to wow and."
431.0,Provider,Does tylenol work for you.
2583.0,Patient,I have to watch totally mad because of my liver.
431.0,Provider,You have liver issues as well as look at your labs then. Okay i'm. with lung I don't you have liver test in here.

431.0,Provider,From a long a while back though it's funny.
2583.0,Patient,yeah I have issues with being a very hard sick like they have to go as far as getting an ultrasound machine. Okay um I. said on the labs from the last from the detox that I was in.
431.0,Provider,Do you have a yeah do you actually have a primary care doctor that monitors your lives outside.
2583.0,Patient,And no.
431.0,Provider,Oh so because you've mentioned liver and kidney you know liver.
2583.0,Patient,"I had hepatitis C, but I did you treatments yeah. Sure, so I mean when I went into remission."
431.0,Provider,that's totally.
2583.0,Patient,"I just had, I just watch the amount of like acetaminophen that I."
431.0,Provider,got it it's just on a like a gusto practice like a lot of us and you only gives us a good baseline of the warrior APP.
2583.0,Patient,Because.
431.0,Provider,"we're medications we do want to make sure. Your livers are working your kidneys are working, just as you kind of process these medications and things change right and."
2583.0,Patient,They. Like you said I had blood work done at the hospital. I had had surgery.
431.0,Provider,If you have those we can we'll take those that's.
2583.0,Patient,Like I think I think I should be able to get on to my chart. yeah if you.
431.0,Provider,"If you have that, let me i'll make a note for them to reach out to you for records, because I honestly don't know how that's like you know completed securely because. Right, so if you have any more recent bloodwork done anywhere hospitals just fine. If you can send that to us just so we have on file to comment about your liver okay. So tylenol is it does work and between tylenol and ibuprofen there was a study that was done that it's almost as effective as like norco if you just use both of. Those over the counter Matthews."
2583.0,Patient,Asset don't work for me.
431.0,Provider,yeah yeah so it's just I mean.
2583.0,Patient,"Nothing man that man that works, I have a genetic mutation."
431.0,Provider,Oh you're like.
2583.0,Patient,"to live there i'm. Mostly most it doesn't break ground in my body on my you are more stronger pain medications like the vika then perfect fraud know if you have that type of pain medication, it does not break down in my body correctly like a regular person. yeah I played it and it it's like there's no difference like i've never been a group on."
431.0,Provider,got it. And so I mean that's kind of a blessing.
2583.0,Patient,Right.
431.0,Provider,"The over the counter stuff works for you, but yeah with ibuprofen always take it with food tylenol for you, I guess, without seeing kind of your lab results you know with your liver generally just don't go over like for tablets a."
2583.0,Patient,"day or two, I mean I take tylenol. If you know the if I don't have anything else, and I usually like to tap to tablets i'm like every six to eight hours, I don't even take it, like any closer to that. So, but usually I take a once in that at the."
431.0,Provider,"outset okay yeah it's just the quantity, that we need to monitor like you can't take care, but you just take like. People with no issues I usually say no more than six tablets a day for both people right all. Right, but for you, if you have you know liver issues to tylenol then obviously just don't go over. Your tablets or 2000 milligrams a day. Right and then ibuprofen you know if you don't have kidney issues, then it's no more than netflix for its kind of your. magic numbers to use those particular with food. I don't want you to get a stomach bleed OK, so the plan is i'm going to message Isaiah to confirm the quantity, I will let them know you will you will attend group next week. And I will also make a note about. Your current appointment frequency in the system. Okay um if, for whatever reason he feels you need to tend to more. i'm going to leave him to discuss that with you."
2583.0,Patient,Is that okay yeah that's fine.
431.0,Provider,"yeah but and then, if I don't hear anything back from him by five o'clock your time I will basically let you know and then call it a bridge prescription for a week. Okay, so that sounds like."
2583.0,Patient,A plan that's yes. Okay malware be able to bridge the gap open today. yeah okay.
431.0,Provider,"yeah yeah so for both i'm gonna wait to see if he gets back. Okay um. If not, I will call them the bridge for solution for both okay perfect and and the your suboxone or buprenorphine."
2583.0,Patient,All right. yeah.
431.0,Provider,"That well you'll get something hopefully today, but just. To see what i'm trying to confirm."
2583.0,Patient,Okay sounds good.
431.0,Provider,"Okay, any other thing I can help you with."
2583.0,Patient,Now that is it.

As well well is having repeated conversations with bright her health staff about her current appointment scheduling. per patient she should be on the bi weekly medication group and her medication quantity based on discussion with provider she'll be monthly supply at a time at this time purple's patient is. On a weekly medical appointment frequency schedule with a prescription guidelines suggesting reduction to four days, plus one refilled due to appointment attendance, however, that will be addressed by contacting the providers so. What I will do is contact the provider to confirm patients attendance, as well as the quantity of the medication patient will is requesting for bridge prescription for buprenorphine. suboxone as well as gabba penton so depending on what the provider response patient will receive either a seven day. bridge to the mat group appointment next week or an additional quantity, as approved by the provider additionally discuss with patient over the counter pain medication management with acetaminophen and ibuprofen Max dose needed, as well as. Any counseling points for kidney and liver function. Patient will. look into medicaid or medical records for her lab tests that are more recent than what we have on file from. Just because of the common on her liver function and it's important that we continue to monitor patient does not have additional needs at this time and understands the plan. I will communicate with a patient by five o'clock Eastern standard time if. If the medication supplies will be called it, and what quantity, thank you."
