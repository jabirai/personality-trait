252.0,Provider,hey medicine. And or yeah.
6126.0,Patient,"Okay, how are you."
252.0,Provider,Is that a new puppy that you got on the front page. give you a page.
6126.0,Patient,Oh no that's an old photo of my friends dog.
252.0,Provider,"Oh, I was like you."
6126.0,Patient,Doing okay i'm kind of stressed out lately and just having a more pain flares.
252.0,Provider,Oh no.
6126.0,Patient,"kind of stressful and then I just went to the doctor and found out. I have like reactive hypoglycemia so that's the reason why i'm why i've been having these like narcolepsy like symptoms. is like in some people their pancreas can just break down the sugar too fast and shoot up two months insulin so it's sometimes i'll just fall asleep after eating. So she told me that was probably the reason why, and so now, I have to like change my diet and stuff but at least I have an answer, but kind of hard to have to like kind of now go almost like on a diabetic ish diet, or just like really watch what I eat so i'm not falling asleep uncontrollably."
252.0,Provider,What have you checked out what are diabetics. meal plan looks like.
6126.0,Patient,"No, not yet, but she told me just to limit. Like simple carbs and stuff. So and but she said, like everybody's different so I have to just kind of see what specific foods are causing me to have that reaction. yeah so we'll take some some research and learning I guess."
252.0,Provider,Okay. That sounds like fun. So you've got that. and your pain how's your pain been.
6126.0,Patient,"um it's been kind of like after like a six or higher for most days and I don't know if it was just due to me being at the end of my botox cycle, because I do notice that when I get near to needing a new injection then it does ramp up. But I think it might be, because I also got. A cavity filled and it got filled a little too high for my night guard. So I need them to shave it down because it's not fitting in my night guard correctly. And so it's putting a lot more pressure on just one to two, I think that it's probably cause of it so it's just a few things I have to take care of and do but. yeah."
252.0,Provider,And are you still working.
6126.0,Patient,"I am I got like a new job kind of doing like dog walking and like hesitating so it's kind of like random, so I only work like eight hours last week because it's usually just like 30 minute walks a few times a week. So i've been doing that, which is nice because it's. Like easy on me and I can kind of make my own schedule a little bit, so I am earning a little bit of money doing that, but it's like away from people and a lot less stressful than what I was doing, which was retail."
252.0,Provider,yeah definitely and you like it a lot better.
6126.0,Patient,yeah definitely. And it gives me some exercise too so that's good all the way around.
252.0,Provider,yeah sounds like it makes a difference. yeah less stress. yeah and how's your anxiety been.
6126.0,Patient,um it's been it's been good yeah I haven't had that much anxiety which has been Nice.
252.0,Provider,and your depression has.
6126.0,Patient,"kind of been up and down it hasn't been too bad recently. yeah hey thank just. Just normal, so no big dips which has been Nice."
252.0,Provider,yeah I bet. yeah are you ready for. Halloween.
6126.0,Patient,"Ah i'm kind of little bit I think i'm just going to go to my friend's house, they want to play dungeons and dragons which nobody's ever done before so. that's cool I know they want to get like really into it and so we're planning that so it'll be a pretty low key, I think."
252.0,Provider,that's still sounds like fun.
6126.0,Patient,yeah i'm glad i'm doing something.
252.0,Provider,"yeah getting out being with your friends, you know. that's good What about. thanksgiving and Christmas."
6126.0,Patient,"yeah I think. I think the whole family's going to be able to get together this year which will be nice we didn't last year, so I think we just have to plan what we're doing. yeah and then it'll just be the four of us, and maybe my sister's boyfriend so it'll be my parents and then my sister and I so it'll be good."
252.0,Provider,"It sounds like it's gonna be good. yeah definitely good i'm glad, everything is going good with you."
6126.0,Patient,yeah no complaints really.
252.0,Provider,awesome and everything's okay with mom.
6126.0,Patient,"Your mom's doing okay dad's having some trouble with his weight and realizing that he has continued to gain weight and. might be pre diabetic but he doesn't want to get his sugars tested so i'm trying not to like take that on because we have talked to him about it for over a year and a half. But it's like there's nothing we can do. unless he wants to do something so i'm trying to. yeah give myself to understand that, but other than that everyone's we're all hanging in there, doing okay."
252.0,Provider,"Good good good and how's the weather, where you're at."
6126.0,Patient,"Oh, we had that storm yesterday it wasn't too bad, thankfully, but we do live in a rural area that's like unincorporated so there's no gutters or anything really or like sidewalks so we did flood a little bit and. Part of our fence fell down and like three areas which was not great, but I think my parents, they contacted like the Homeowners insurance right away so. glad we got the rain not happy, the fence fell down, but its overall good for California and yeah i'm glad it wasn't worse."
252.0,Provider,"yeah definitely and you know California is going, what is this. This was a lot right, I mean what. yeah so definitely I think it's is good, I think that I needed it, especially after all the fires and everything has happened so. You know, makes a big difference. yeah so everything is good, with you mentally emotionally physically."
6126.0,Patient,"yeah pretty much yeah now, I just have to kind of look up do some research on that diet stuff but yeah i'm glad it's not narcolepsy excels, the only thing I could think of where I like couldn't keep myself awake and. That makes a lot of sense what she said so i'll just have to do some research on that and really stick to it but i'm glad I know now because. scary I was wondering if I was gonna like fall asleep driving like one time or just like so Now I know. Just kind of cut back on the sugar a lot."
252.0,Provider,Like do you eat a lot of sugar.
6126.0,Patient,"not really not that much. it's been like random foods that have done, and like we went to Korean bbq and I fell asleep there and I think they added a lot of like sugar to the meat so, even though I was eating meat and vegetables, it was just like a lot of sweetener added and. it's happened after drink one glass of champagne one time, so I don't drink a lot so i'll just cut that out, but. I think, maybe, just like the simple carbs like she was saying, maybe that's probably the issue like bread i've kind of have my intake of like bread recently but yes, I don't know it's not been. I know I have to figure out high school really know."
252.0,Provider,yeah that's really weird and you'll fall asleep like in the restaurant or.
6126.0,Patient,"yeah um yeah it was really weird like i'll have like a ski like this wave over me and then 10 minutes later I can't keep my eyes open and I have to like close my eyes and lie down and I fall asleep. She told me to eat like meat around like simple carbs and stuff and I was like well, I was at like a Barbecue I was eating meat, so I don't really know."
252.0,Provider,hmm.
6126.0,Patient,I don't know if it's just a combination of like chronic fatigue plus maybe the sugar. So.
252.0,Provider,And she's already she's already ruled out narcolepsy.
6126.0,Patient,"yeah she said, if it's not happening around food. Well, I told her, I was like it happens when I after I eating sometimes like when I haven't eaten for a while, so I don't know if it keeps happening, then i'll probably go back to her and be like what is this like narcolepsy or like something like that, because i've had it both."
252.0,Provider,yeah that's really weird.
6126.0,Patient,"yeah tell the difference between like my normal fatigue and just being tired and wanting to take a nap over like get the wave and then 10 minutes later I can't keep my eyes open, so I guess, I will just I have to start tracking seeing, if I can find patterns."
252.0,Provider,"yeah see what it is that you're eating, and you know really trying to maybe what you should do is just go straight for like a. Vegetable."
6126.0,Patient,yeah. plant that you know.
252.0,Provider,"Just a vegetable meal, you know and see if you know around like take one day and just have nothing but vegetables and things that come out of the ground and see if it happens or not. Because that's really weird I would be i'd be a little concerned do."
6126.0,Patient,"yeah I thought cuz it's happened for like maybe like two years on and off, but I like thought I was like well i'm on new medication, I went to college at this and that but i'm like okay there's nothing like I don't know so."
252.0,Provider,i'm still doing it.
6126.0,Patient,"yeah so I have to, I have to definitely track a whole bunch of stuff and start eating more plant based diet and everything."
252.0,Provider,"wow that's really weird you know what I mean i'm. Really stream, so I would probably go all the way to the extreme going Okay, no bread, no. potatoes, no, you know."
6126.0,Patient,No.
252.0,Provider,"Yes, great you know all right let's let's start here, you know because. You know what I mean it's just. it's baffling."
6126.0,Patient,It was really weird to hear how was like oh okay.
252.0,Provider,So about my food. What can I didn't dinners do you eat.
6126.0,Patient,"um. We usually have a vegetable and then maybe like I. don't even know the pasta, or like super chicken is usually like chicken so it's usually have protein and rice chicken and rice and like asparagus broccoli so it's okay. So that's why I was like it's not happening every time I eat. Like I can pinpoint certain times, where I can tell okay yeah that was from like. Food, but other times it's like recently this week it's been I will be watching TV with my mom and then it'll just hit me and I haven't eaten something for a while and that weird wave so that's why I thought it was like narcolepsy or something like that. So i'm not 100% convinced, but i'll definitely change my diet, because."
252.0,Provider,yeah because if that happens it isn't necessarily around food.
6126.0,Patient,yeah exactly that's why I was like huh okay.
252.0,Provider,But didn't she say that if it happens not around food.
6126.0,Patient,And it's might be a narcolepsy yeah. I know it's very it was really confusing and.
252.0,Provider,So she didn't hear the fact that it's not happening it's.
6126.0,Patient,"Not and then yeah and then she didn't hear where I said, well, I was at Korean bbq where I ate a lot of me and then she was like well, you need to eat meat your simple carbs so I was like okay."
252.0,Provider,I think she didn't hear what you said.
6126.0,Patient,yeah so I have to like reiterate to her and be see if we can do any like sleep test or something.
252.0,Provider,"yeah have it, you know one step further, because I don't think she heard those two things if those two things are what she's saying you know definitely are indicators for possible narcolepsy then, and you have all three so."
6126.0,Patient,"It was a I know I was like trying to like get it to her, but she was kind of just like oh it's this like your sugars and your pancreas and I was like. Okay."
252.0,Provider,"After have a nurse that makes all the calls or it deals with the prescriptions or whatever. I would call her and tell her you know I just was in with my doctor and i'm just really confused and you know, I would like a little bit of clarity can you help me."
6126.0,Patient,yeah I think I yeah i'm thinking that I need to do that and just. reiterate like yeah it's happened when I haven't eaten stuff. And when i've been like a full meal of like protein and meat.
252.0,Provider,"Yes, it's there's not one pinpoint it's happening when i'm just watching TV with mom. You know what I mean. And I don't I would tell her I don't think she heard what everything that I said, because two of the things that she said. two out of the three I told her I had but she didn't hear me when I told her. yeah you know. yeah so definitely reiterate that, with her, because I would hate for us to see you suffer for nothing."
6126.0,Patient,I know I know yeah I don't want to. I wanted answers.
252.0,Provider,yeah and so that's what I would suggest you do is color nurse and just kind of clarify it for her so that she knows you know and it's not something that she can overlook because you're you're making sure she has the Info you know. For miscommunication. Do you like really shy when you go to the doctor and.
6126.0,Patient,"Now I had her for a while and I liked her it was just like early in the morning and really tie heard and I. was just like okay you're telling me this so. Okay sure that makes sense and then I just didn't want to keep repeating myself, but I need to find want answers. yeah again on it."
252.0,Provider,"yeah and just kind of you know, give them a list of when it happens when i'm not eating when i'm watching TV with my mom when i'm eating me all kinds of meat. I mean so there's not one scenario that's making it happen it's all different areas. So that's my suggestion."
6126.0,Patient,"that's good i'll just yeah i'll definitely do that soon, just so I don't forget."
252.0,Provider,"yeah yeah I would just say I need some clarity and I think the doctor needs a little more clarity to. You know I think we had a miscommunication when I was in the other day, as it is that simple, you know. I was tired. You know."
6126.0,Patient,"I was, I was tired and. I yeah."
252.0,Provider,"So, will you try it."
6126.0,Patient,"yeah I will definitely do that, I think I can also send her a message directly. Oh that's."
252.0,Provider,that's a good idea yeah I forgot some systems do that now.
6126.0,Patient,"yeah they did that so i'll see if I can get it in within like the 200 characters or whatever they get let me do, and if not, then all i'll leave like a message."
252.0,Provider,"Okay, good good good all right, so are you coming to group this week."
6126.0,Patient,yeah i'll be there tomorrow.
252.0,Provider,Okay cool all right well yeah to hear you go on about your day and keep being awesome as you are.
