740.0,Provider,"From an empty my mind I don't i'm not trying to take you too far back. You know, but i'm just gonna ask this. Question if you don't remember therefore i'm saying, but it seems that you got a good memory, so I think people remember this. So growing up for you what was your family like what was family life, like, for you."
16339.0,Patient,"My family, I had a brother and a mom and dad and a very large extended family, and it was wonderful. There I felt a little bit left out many times, because my brother was the big man on campus you know the big quarterback and. And I was a little chubby Nancy. You know who got patted on the head and, and so I you know, I was pretty quiet because of that and. So I felt, you know I felt isolated, you know many times and I never said anything to my parents, but. I don't know whether they noticed it or not, I also was. sickly I had asthma and you know when you get sick a lot and and. But besides all of that, you know I, and I had school version, because I didn't want only my mother. And besides that you know my my life was was very good."
740.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16339.0,Patient,"You know I wasn't. My father never raised his hand to me, you know my mom didn't. So you know, there was no, you know physical abuse and I don't think my mom was now that I reflect back I think she was. A very strict Armenian woman whose family had come here from the old country. And she had a lot of. A lot of. She witnessed a lot of things that happened to her family, so I think she was she was kind of gruff. and I was exactly the opposite. um I was the sensitive one, you know the peacemaker, and all that so. I don't know don't don't remember that much more."
740.0,Provider,You can use the. I can say I can relate to you will ever bought the being the arithmetic mimicry is real and i'm still asthmatic.
16339.0,Patient,Are you damn.
740.0,Provider,But i'll say I go to the I work out. yeah I don't I don't let those things stop me I just got to figure out what triggers it and I know what I know what you're gonna do so I just kind of stay away from those things. The same name. yeah i'm. So i'm with you and your brother if you're ready for the last. yeah okay Andy I have a good relationship now.
16339.0,Patient,"We have one now we went through a period of. Oh, probably seven or eight years where we argued, we thought you know. he's my brother is very, very. This is what it is whites whites blacks black and you know if there's any he doesn't understand. The emotional side of what i'm trying to tell them. When we when we sold my mother's House after she passed away. You know I said, you know, maybe we can keep it for a while. Why is why, why do you want to do that, and I said, well, I you know i'd like to really clean it up and maybe rent it, oh no, no, no, no, no i'm not going to rent it down, oh no and so he just kept you know pushing on me and. At that time I was using fewer assets, so I think. I don't think my judgment was the best I think my emotions were really you know, out of whack. And, and so you know we sold the House, and I mean I resented him for it, then he just spoke back to me like you know get a life grow up you know this is how things happen and. It just was a difference in in our personalities. um so that brought his his son in in the son, who I used to take care of a lot when when he was a baby turned against me and the whole the rest of the family, you know kind of turned against me. And I got so that my children had had to make a decision as to whether or not they wanted to see their uncle and one of my children said oh it's Okay, and my younger one said, why would I want to go see somebody that's for you so much. i'm so I mean my kids have just. Separate personalities."
740.0,Provider,"Reviewing today anyone in the home, every struggle with mental health or substance abuse or eating disorders. How outside of the would you call it chevy Nancy. yeah cool how how was school for you What was it like."
16339.0,Patient,"I think that. I wasn't a great student. And my parents didn't seem to mind. and After I got out of grammar school and I started doing better and then I then I realized that I had a really hard time reading and my comprehension was really bad and then, as I went through and became a teacher. I kind of diagnosed myself with a pretty serious learning disability that hadn't been addressed at all. So I you know somebody could read something once i'd have to read it five times and underline it and. To make sure that I remembered it. So, but I I went to college and I was on the dean's list and. I won't be like I mean I really turned. That around, and you know got a master's in, and you know, suddenly, I think there was a little respect from my brother. who had he had gone to UCLA on a football scholarship and he was big man on campus at UCLA and and then he got hurt and he wasn't supposed to really play anymore, and he didn't and so he. flunked out of college. While and came home and they told him that he could continue to have the scholarship and he said no, he said, they just don't want to go to school. So he was lucky lucky enough to work with my dad who was successful. And he had you know he had his life so you know there there's there been times when things have been Okay, but but mostly he's very remote for me. As he is. with other members of the family. People don't understand why he is, but you know I just i'm somewhat spiritual so I just I just pray for acceptance for the way he is. And it works. yeah."
740.0,Provider,"You game to leaving the man, the Lord."
16339.0,Patient,that's it that's it I couldn't do anymore.

And she refuses to tell me things and there's been a lot of history and in her in her background. She met a guy and when she was in college and she fell in love and she. Was 20, I guess, and they just took off and. You gave her a ring when she was 22 this big old diamond and I thought, what the hell, you know, and my husband was just beside himself, he wasn't the same religion, we are. And when you're when you're Jewish it's up to the woman to bear children and raise them in as as Jewish and that was hard for me, and you know I prayed and prayed and prayed you know for acceptance on that deal and I just couldn't get there because."
740.0,Provider,yeah.
16339.0,Patient,"You know, he was, I mean it's very smart I didn't care much for his family, but that's that's here nor there, but so I just didn't want her to marry them and I kind of went ballistic. yeah yeah honey, if you do this your life is miserable. and So she eventually just broke the engagement.

740.0,Provider,And she said.
16339.0,Patient,"Well i'm not going to tell you anything. yeah I don't want anybody to get hurt. I don't want anything to happen it's over with. And so that's that's been praying on my mind, for a very, very long time. yeah and then she met this other guy. she's an emergency room physician."

We were okay for a while and then I asked another question and then she goes away. and the last thing she did was. She took me off her text list so I can't text her. And she took me off of instagram so I can see your pictures. um and she thinks that our relationship is better because of that, and you know what I just it's gone on for so long that I just accept what it is, you know she's and she and her sister don't get along so it's been. it's been hard know there's a lot of hurt involved and."
