July of 2020 and then i've been. i've taken away the group therapy, because I don't need that anymore, and I just do. monthly check ins so i'm just it's not too much of a concern anymore, for me, which is. Good. I mean it's. Still there yeah of course it's still there, so it's always going to be there, I resigned with like that fact, but are not as prevalent in my life as it used to be, but yes definitely history."
705.0,Provider,"Okay, thank you for clarifying and if ever there's a time to the you are looking for more support, I know, with my heart, health, we have an eating disorder program also.

14385.0,Patient,dry shampoo works wonders.
705.0,Provider,"Yes, yes, I know, and you know we're sanitizing all tie, you know how. Many times a day absolutely Let me, then, what i'm going to switch gears on and you might have already memorized this one is our safety protocol it's from the Columbia risk and protective factors. Okay, and so this one is more geared towards suicide, and so we asked first is within your lifetime, have you ever wished that you are dead or we should go to sleep and not wake up."
14385.0,Patient,I mean like not really because it's just I mean like nothing to the point where it was ever like a concern.
705.0,Provider,"Okay, so never in your lifetime has there been like a plan."
14385.0,Patient,"No, no it's like a. it's just kind of like a running joke no joke where it's like don't do this right now it's. Like no like no plans, no like intense nothing like that."
705.0,Provider,"You took the words right out of my mouth where you're already with intent you're like I know what you're going to ask next. plan no intent Okay, you know more quiz different people are at different levels and so sometimes if a person is suicidal we support them and we come up with a safety plan. But what i'm gathering, so that you have not had in the past and then today the have any suicide ideation or any plans to harm yourself. No okay any history of self harm, such as burns making small cuts or anything like that."
14385.0,Patient,"No, not really I just like sometimes if I would like go down a spiral, I would like, I like described right there, so I would like. hit like like if I was driving and I was like crying i'd like hit my hand like aggressively against the steering wheel, but I feel like that was just like an explosion of emotion it wasn't like an intent for like I need to feel pain so. yeah."
705.0,Provider,"that's that's how you described it is spot on and so i'm getting that no self interest behavior it was just more of a frustration and if you live in California, the traffic is."
14385.0,Patient,Driving you get it down.
705.0,Provider,"Absolutely any weapons in your home. Today, such as."
14385.0,Patient,Various care.
705.0,Provider,"More towards like guns, do you. have no access to guns Okay, have you, and again I know some of these questions i've already asked, but have you ever collected pills obtained a gun gave away valuables are wrote a will or a suicide note."
14385.0,Patient,"I have written the well. But that's probably my own trauma speaking it's not like a real will it's just assign it's assigned it's a self signed document that I keep in my desk just just that says like. In the even in my passing all of my like monetary value goes to my sister, and these things go to these people, the rest can be divided accordingly. it's just it's just because, like. My mom and I have a very like like i've been around death so much in my life and i'm just like used to it at this point and it just kind of like every time. I buy something new for my room right by like a little church key, all I can think about is like is this going to go in my dead person box. Like who's gonna have to because i've just been through boxes and boxes of dead people shit all my life. is like there's so many more boxes in my family's garage like from all these dead relatives and it's like we're not even using that stuff so it's like. I just for like my own peace of mind until I can like legally get one down like i'm going to divide my stuff accordingly like make it easy for everyone, because I don't want to have anyone have to deal with all my shit when I go."
705.0,Provider,yeah and to me how you described it as more in preparation and the. yeah but it's not like you're preparing like you're setting a date or anything like that.
14385.0,Patient,"And so, no it's just it's adjusting case peace of mind, like my mom knows that I have it my sister, yes, they have it and, like some housemates know where it is again, just in case if anything happens like I have it on paper have it down."
705.0,Provider,"yeah, and that makes sense, too, because, like you, are sharing that you've had a lot of death, and so you know what that's like and now seeing people go. I mean."
14385.0,Patient,"it's it's so funny because my mom is like she she's adjusting her will because, like we just been around it so much. it's gotten, to the point that, like she'll come up from the garage when i'm home and she will hold up like a Turkey pain and she's like the you girls more face when i'm gone and be oyster like no, just like the the Turkey Pam goes."
705.0,Provider,"wow well, I again I I hear utilization of humor that even within your family you're like you know we've been through tough times, but this is how we're going to handle it can your mom's like okay well just eliminate those from the box."
14385.0,Patient,"My family uses we give each other really hard we're okay with like there's definitely some issue there there's always coming together with family like we have our good days, we have our bad days, but we definitely use humor like so much in the House like. there's the running gag of like it's a learned behavior of like it's. All to do something weird i'll have like I have my name my address my email like in my suitcase in case anyone finds me and my mom always has been told me that I opened my suitcase and sort of my sister, and she pointed out that she was yes, yes that's a learned behavior."
705.0,Provider,"Oh, I it's funny and it becomes that way to or you start telling another you're going to see me at that you know it's like come on let's reframe let's see what we have next. Oh that's so funny with the learned behavior well, and you know I think the world needs therapy If only you know at a young age, we had access to it it's like wouldn't life, be a little bit different. Absolutely, and the past three months, is there any like recent losses significant negative events such as legal, financial relationship losses."
14385.0,Patient,"Yes, I had a very recent it was a long time coming, build up falling out with my. best friend of three years, and so she's not really a part of my life anymore, but it is whole situation I do still feel supported I live with people I really like my. i'm very lucky to say that I have a very grounded like support system of like people with different personalities different responses to events, so I feel very like supportive insecure and, if I have an issue i'm not afraid to like talk it out with them. But yeah I just we just recently, are not not friends anymore."
705.0,Provider,"i'm glad to hear that you do have a support system in the event that you did need you know someone just to you know call to hear you out, can you name like three people that would be your go to people in the event that you needed assistance or just needed someone to hear you out."
14385.0,Patient,my sister my and then my housemates are selling away.
705.0,Provider,"Okay, thank you any pending incarceration or homelessness. Any pending like filling alone, a sense of like isolation. Any hearing voices. Then okay. And I you've already answered no substance use or dependence use. Any thoughts to that you feel suicide is immoral. Any thoughts that suicide, that you would have a fear of death or dying are suffering."
14385.0,Patient,"I mean, like my view of death is like completely skewed and I like made my peace with it, I am not afraid to go, but not like that. i'm not afraid to go, because it happens to everyone, you never know tomorrow's not guaranteed do do what you can and see how it goes. But i'm clearly we're very skewed you do to my own. i'm not afraid of death i'm not like. I can easily look down at and go like yeah someday like i'm now, which is very hard for a lot of people to comprehend, but i'm like no we're good it's going to end up one day."
705.0,Provider,"to embrace it when the time comes, but again, you you. yeah very clearly have shared that you're not suicidal and you're not trying to enter your life is just embracing it when the time comes. Can you give me a couple of reasons why you view that life is worth living."
14385.0,Patient,If I go in and i'm going to tell an old book releases that I love so much i'll never get to read a repeat of the finished hope the series that i'm reading I. Love travel I love the world I love fun experiences what Why would I want to get rid of that.
705.0,Provider,"All good reasons. Can you tell me to if there's anything that I haven't asked you that you feel is important that I know or a bright heart health in order to to work with you, better."
14385.0,Patient,"hurry home digestive issues. But i'm working on that I just had an ultrasound yesterday they're checking my system to make sure everything's like. In place organ wise and doing Okay, but it's an ongoing issue that i'm dealing with but that's really, all I can think of."
705.0,Provider,"Well, thank you for for sharing that also that's always good information to have the more information, we have the better picture you know of how to help. I wanted to see to it looks like Madeline I just pulled up your trip so as of right now you're going to be. Seeing continue to seeing your outside therapist correct. Okay, and then you'll be in the weekly groups."
14385.0,Patient,"I was gonna I checked in with. I said that since like i'm like good therapy was fantastic for me when I needed it, but I am like, and it was really nice to sit in group, like a week or two ago it's just like. i'm going to say this, and I don't need to be pitching but, like, I am just in such a different place with like my personal recovery how i've done like i'm. And I know that, like that can be really helpful to a group to have someone like who's kind of like, on the other end of it now like working on recovery is not as like in deep as other people, but I just like. I my schedule is so packed like work and classes and everything that I don't necessarily have any interest in group therapy and I was told that it would be okay, just to do like a monthly check in just like it didn't just like a chicken about medication."
705.0,Provider,"That sounds great, and that was where I was leading to this, as I know, Mary kastner is your prescriber she's wonderful. And i'm glad you already had this conversation where them what we can do is where the care intensity is only once a month. If you feel you need to come more into group, then by all means, but it's Nice that that that's already something that you've worked out, so I will do my part to. just put in my notation that you're seeing an outside therapist and so you have the support there you're going to come into once a month group so you have the support there and in the event that any of this changes and you need. More support you'll be giving us a call and letting us know. yeah okay well that sounds good, and it does sound like with work you're like juggling a couple of different things, so I appreciate again that you making the time and enjoy the rest of your lunch, hopefully, you get a little bit more for your lunch."
14385.0,Patient,I have an hour it'll it'll work out.
705.0,Provider,"Okay, well, it was a pleasure meeting you Madeline and again, thank you. For I know sensitive questions and things like that, but. Thank you for sharing and we will see you hopefully sooner."
14385.0,Patient,If I because it was the 12 to one or the 11th is the 12 to one group right on Tuesdays. Right and. If I think I have like a different check in with her health at that time I was wondering is October 5 could tell just my like look they check in.
705.0,Provider,There is. Another appointment that you're having was Mary Kay caster or.
14385.0,Patient,"I think it I think it's someone different I just checked my email, but I didn't know if you could transfer connect me to someone who like handle scheduling. If I thought, because because my. Because I only get to tuesday's off. i'm on. A quiet, and so I already have my morning Tuesday booked."
705.0,Provider,"I know and i'm looking to see if I can see, on your appointments of what's in here. And you're saying it's the fifth of October."
14385.0,Patient,it's the 19th is when the appointment is.
705.0,Provider,"Okay, what i'm reading is October the 19th and then that is the group medication time and. Is that."
14385.0,Patient,"I got my I got my appointments mixed up that the 19th would be preferable, is what i'm trying to say and do I have it on the night."
705.0,Provider,"Right that's what I am reading. Okay you're confirming this because. Today we have the appointment, so your bps evaluation is done, you can mark that off your list. And then I see the 19th is for group medic medication. that's at 12 o'clock."
14385.0,Patient,"don't use the same link that I was emailed last time, or will they send an updated."
705.0,Provider,"On the group, you would use the same and what they always asked to. His first good pH benign."
14385.0,Patient,Do those got it.
705.0,Provider,"right if you can do surveys and then also to with virtual clinic just check in even if you check in like earlier in the morning to do early check in just to get that out of the way and then that's the way that we make sure that your attendance is noted. So check in with a virtual clinic you can share with them, you did all your your surveys that you needed to do then you'll come and you'll check in the group. Also to with the groups, we encourage that you stay throughout the whole session, however, in the event that you need to leave. Just direct message like if it's the 12 o'clock i'm the facilitator just direct message that you you're going to have to take off. If there is medication needs to with Mary and then you're going to have to leave later just let her know at the beginning, just chat and say you know I need a medication refill any questions for me i'm going to have to take off in 10 minutes. communicate that way with us and then that way, we have it online everything is here, and you just continue getting the support that you need and. we'll just you know if ever there's a time that you need something different, we have different groups at different times and Mary kastner has I think on Mondays and Tuesdays a whole list of them. at different times so just let us know."
14385.0,Patient,"I have like a stupid quick question and I don't know you potentially could help, but like I went on medication and like i've been on medication on this, my third week. In like the first two weeks, I was like hyper and motivated in in but I noticed that, like it, I can't have this as stupid as say but it's like i'm still sad. I thought, like, I thought it was a just like. In terms of like when you're when you're dealing with a lot of stuff and you're brain like tricks, you and I can't tell us like. i'm supposed to still be sad or if it's supposed to like go away completely like are you are, you always going to just be like underlying Lee sad."
705.0,Provider,"I think any question as silly or you use the word stupid, not at all when it comes to you and your mental health, please ask be assertive like you're doing today. To answer your question, I can share with you just my experience working as one of the counselors in the mental health groups is that it's it varies for every person and a lot of it is built on experiences experiences, if there was a lot of childhood trauma. That can play a part in the depression, however, if you're in different healing stages like you're going and you're seeking therapy and you're starting to make progress. Then, a person might notice that some of those things is not as severe so to answer your question melon I haven't heard like as much of it just will disappear, but the intensity will get less where it's more manageable and more tolerable."
14385.0,Patient,Oh yeah it's it's definitely manageable.
705.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
14385.0,Patient,The other accents.
705.0,Provider,yeah and it's not I guess.
14385.0,Patient,I had this like naive worldview of like take the pill fix your brain.
705.0,Provider,"There are moments to say, to be fair balance, where people describe that that's how it they feel that like for a couple of weeks that they've been really like surprised at themselves that they didn't have any of that internal sadness that they've described before. And so I mean that has happened to it with with life and not knowing, you know how it is like we have all of everyday life changes every day and trying to keep up with that is can be wearing and especially on our emotions. So you know. What I always encourage you to do is ask the prescribers to marry kastner will be able to give you two from her experience. Of what she can tell, especially with the different medication she is so knowledgeable and can share with you a really honest that's a good question and I would want to know too. So from just a counseling standpoint i've seen such different degrees Madeline. part of what I think is so important and you're already doing this, is that you took a look at like with the eating disorder. You weren't afraid to like move forward when you have a problem i'm seeing where you like you don't go around it, you had towards it, you already did that, with the eating disorder and you're maintaining that progress by doing a monthly check in.
