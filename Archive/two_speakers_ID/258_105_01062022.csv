Okay. Oh, my gosh so tell me your first impression, what do you tell me about the people tell me about the facility."
258.0,Patient,"So reception is wonderful, the facility it's its own. So there's lots of activities and there's lots of opportunities to. Be as sociable as you'd like or not they've got like a movie a. movie screen, with some comfortable seating they've got. A Community kitchen they've got. A little convenience store, there are several common areas. The room, however, is an elite bike on the privacy i've got. A sort of a little balcony where I could see over where I could see you know balloon fiesta park. And look at the goings on out in the north valley there it's Nice. I haven't really i've met a physical therapists. Wonderful that. i'll be working with that is. fairly. We talked a lot about how tense my my. musculature is just just completely tense throughout so we talked a lot about. Getting some of that loosened up. So it just gives me a lot of hope that i'm gonna i'm gonna thrive there."
105.0,Provider,"Is their wi fi is their Internet, what do you have for."
258.0,Patient,"Connected there. There, there is wi fi."
105.0,Provider,and other classes Member I was asking if they were going to do any.

105.0,Provider,yoga to be chair tight yes.
258.0,Patient,"there's a range of activities that I could participate in and my discretion. So. So that type of stuff is is. At my discretion, but I will have sort of a. will need to develop my plan of care they're just based on. everybody's going to need to get caught up on on my current condition on everything, and of course i've you know submitted everything and but it now it's going to be committed just no paperwork, I need to communicate things and. So, from what I understand will be developing. A plan of care for me, a comprehensive plan. I mean we've got sort of a template with all you know all the medical releases and all that information they've got plenty of information to. To go off of now, we just need to. for lack of a better word customize it to my. My needs right now i'm excited and. I keep telling myself just get this little move over with, and yes, then I can relax and. Concentrate on taking care of myself and."
105.0,Provider,"So, so my concern is the move, my concern is that you've gotten this far and that you're going to push too hard you're sure that these little brats. This little grown body brats can't lift a frickin box."
258.0,Patient,i've got a. You know I. got a nephew that that might help me actually I can ask him and his son. yeah.
105.0,Provider,"Right is what you do I mean we've been at the final hour of things don't screw it up. With over exertion i'm keeping it super simple that you don't have to analyze that. You could go hurt yourself, right now, and now the experience is going to be oh now you have this, and now you can come in here. What call nephew ask."
258.0,Patient,"Okay. I can do that. yeah it's matter of fact, I might I couldn't even. afford to pay them something."
105.0,Provider,Little something.
258.0,Patient,Okay sweet not do.
105.0,Provider,"Keep it well, it keeps it cleaner for you it's like you're going to put this effort and i'm going to give you this this little tip this little money this. Okay."
258.0,Patient,So no feel better about that yeah but.
105.0,Provider,How come you didn't already reached out to them tell you waiting for me today gotcha what's kept you from doing that.
258.0,Patient,"You know it's really just. thinking that I did I got this is so i've been. i've been. totally aware of, I mean paid attention to my body and things in. But what I what i'm doing is. Like last night I was really, really tired. And there are. Things that I. needed to get done, but I just wanted to rest, but then i'll tell myself. Just do this little extra thing it's not that big of a deal and not and you'll be grateful for tomorrow, so i'll push myself a little bit to get this one other thing done and it written it makes a difference it. helps because I I do appreciate that I pushed myself a little bit to get a little something else done because, and I don't have to do it now. But so that's how I kind of been getting myself through this. I. Thought I. guess I just had it planned out where I. just see myself getting it done. I. Good questions I Devon answer your question yet."
105.0,Provider,Because this isn't logical this isn't emotional health we're starting with you have the reason you're going into this facility is because of physical limitations and here you are moving yourself out you do hear how ridiculous that sounds.
258.0,Patient,"Right now, I do. sounds ridiculous No, I do."
105.0,Provider,"yeah right. And that's you in a nutshell that's you. not paying attention you'll say oh i'm paying attention. I don't want to ask anybody for help. Now I could be wrong and I don't mind hearing it, but is it happening again, but you don't want to bother anybody."
258.0,Patient,I don't. Think here. But.
105.0,Provider,yeah hit me at one more time. hit me. There we go that's back there.
258.0,Patient,yeah my daughter was calling. My map to text her real quick and.
105.0,Provider,Go ahead.
258.0,Patient,"Okay, can you hear me. I can Okay, and what was I saying no I don't feel like it's happening again, I feel like this is a. sort of just like a no man's land here, this is a hospital place and I just want to I. I don't it's not conducive to ask him for help these people are just not."
105.0,Provider,"Yes, you why didn't you ask your nephew already."
258.0,Patient,"i'm still reluctant to. But I think if I have a few bucks it's just going to take that out of the equation there because I feel like he's a type of person that will. I mean if he's going to get paid for the job yo. I don't have to. deal with any. ambivalence or. reticence me asking me nobody wants to he's not gonna want to want to help me move, but."
105.0,Provider,hit me at one more time someone texted you. Know maybe your daughter.
258.0,Patient,With something maybe happening.
105.0,Provider,Why don't you call them i'll stay here call and then come back okay calling me no problem.
258.0,Patient,"Okay. Okay everything's okay she's um she's out of the out of surgery in recovery so everything's okay. Okay, where we going."
105.0,Provider,I was trying to find out well actually what i'm curious about is about how toxic nephew is now I heard a couple things that now concern me somewhat and I really just want to make sure that he's not a toxic person.
258.0,Patient,"Well, I think. he's got his issues, but I don't think either. that's horrible and I don't know go ahead and and asked me what you need because I mean I made it, I made a difference around here and the time that i've been here it's been an exhaustive, but i'm. This place, I mean. The way you have a conversation around here is just shout out non sequiturs as loud, as you can and so see if you're heard, I mean there's. is so weird weird good Oh, but um you know. i've tried to make things better for my sister and part of that was um. there's this huge huge communication breakdown with with her and her kids and everybody hates everybody and whatever but. So i've had to kind of. i've gotten a little close to my nephew in finding out what's really going on, and he doesn't pay his mother and there's issues with patients and. kind of showing them, you know he doesn't need to brow beat her gas lighter anything she's perfectly willing to do anything they want anyway i'm trying to take down some barriers i've made it different step got them they talk every night for hours and how. We. So he's a. he's got he's got. His anger is poorly controlled. So he could be fly off the handle over little things. But I think I think his son is a wonderful kid he's just a wonderful kid he's a big stout guy and he can use a few bucks as well, so I think I think that's a good. that's a good idea, actually to get them now. And, and as long as I can offer something and i'm not asking them for a favor i'll feel more I will feel more comfortable it may not even be that I need to do that, but. We don't make me feel better. And i'll help them out and. we'll get things done."
105.0,Provider,"And how many boxes and pieces of furniture, what exactly were you about to move by yourself, into a truck."
258.0,Patient,yeah. yeah there's a bedroom set and a.
105.0,Provider,i'm I don't even know what to say to you accept. This yes.
258.0,Patient,"I know i've got boxes of office, materials and books and."
105.0,Provider,"Oh, my God, are you books."
258.0,Patient,yeah i'm such a nerd i've got so many books.
105.0,Provider,that's hardly the point.
258.0,Patient,yeah I know I know. I did get like a furniture dollies and I help myself out but.
105.0,Provider,Okay. I want you to picture. That the you're being audited and there's this investigator from the insurance company that's like I wonder if he's really disabled. And they're watching your bedroom set and boxes and then.
258.0,Patient,What.
105.0,Provider,What would they think.
258.0,Patient,"To be. Fair I I don't do it very well. I break down halfway there and get to take a baking gotta. rearrange the so that more balanced it I struggle, you could tell but I get your point oh. And i've been."
105.0,Provider,"hurting you what is it meant another surgery, what if it meant you and did the little bits that you've got now. Not enough to occur to you to take care of you."
258.0,Patient,I guess i've got suited. Though I. know I didn't do this for a long time.
105.0,Provider,I know.
258.0,Patient,it's hard.
105.0,Provider,"But it represents a philosophy that i've been selling i've been doing this dance for you, for a while now huh uh huh self care. And you go yeah oh that that's fantastic that's fantastic that's self care and i've got a lovely text from you, by the way. You want to hear with that text just. Go ahead, why don't we listen to that. Okay uh huh oh thanks when Happy New Year along those lines, I resolve this year to be most kind and loving to someone i've neglected and that person is me and i'm so grateful for all your help and guidance all along the way, that feels like smoke up my ass."
258.0,Patient,i'm sorry. Not though it's not low because I made such. I feel.
105.0,Provider,"Like. You could do more, you could you."
258.0,Patient,"can do more, I can do more, I can do more, I can, and I. That is a sincere text, it is, I may not be. fully aware of all the ways that I. need to be taking care of myself but i'm. i'm open to it, I mean i'm. I don't want to be like where I need to be shown the way all the time I. But i'm open to it, and I do look for ways to get myself of. wow so sick of not reading I. bought myself this magnifier that's like. Take a complete page magnifier and you didn't yeah. yeah stuff like that, or like like last night I was, I was um. yeah I just I just. I was so tired and. I pushed myself to box up something else, and I was going to try to load up. A little bit more on the truck and then I just that's it that's it i'm done, I went to bed I just went straight to bed I didn't. I allowed myself that and. I got some rest. But then, with them. gina's emergency then we're up all the rest of the night. and But anyhow I there. i'm listening to my myself, I mean i'll take a break or can, to some painful. I tried to be just really kind of myself and in. Those ways I just. My assertive you know i've gotten more assertive I. there's just that. it's not really even reluctance to ask for help it's just like it doesn't occur to me almost I guess. i'm not getting I need to get better about that. Yes, it's really, really new to meet it think in. In terms of half of. What kind of help, can I get from my surrounding we i'm just I just had to be so self reliant for so long. But i'm. i'm totally open to. loving and caring for myself, I you know I. There are so many things that I. If I don't do them they're not going to be done, as far as caring for myself like. I kept thinking. I lost my train of thought right now."
105.0,Provider,"Well, it doesn't occur to you and I, and I understand that and. Then you work with that the same way you do remembering other things you gotta you know set alarms for a couple times a day, how can I include, how can I include other people in my wellness what could I do faster better, safer by including other people in this. So, for example, how How long do you think it would take if you did the movie by yourself and how long would it take if you had two people helping you."
258.0,Patient,"yeah that's the difference of. by myself, it would probably take about three days. And and with with with them and we could probably get it done in a day. easy."
105.0,Provider,You have a day of stuff.
258.0,Patient,You whoa.
105.0,Provider,whoa. yeah.
258.0,Patient,"Oh, my God probably take."
105.0,Provider,How big is this truck you rented or borrowing whenever how big.
258.0,Patient,"It is it's just it's a big pickup truck, but it is just a pickup truck so probably be about. i'd say a load to the to AV Amir and then and then maybe three loads to. To storage. And it's mostly just. Just boxes it's not a lot of furniture in the office things and."
105.0,Provider,How many miles away.
258.0,Patient,one hour.
105.0,Provider,How many miles away stuff here to add them here how many miles away storage to have him here.
258.0,Patient,So from here to add a mere is about 10 miles and. From here to the storage is about. 12 miles it not not very far.
105.0,Provider,"And what time, would you be inviting your nephew and his son to do this."
258.0,Patient,"um. I need to see what. kind of. availability, they have them since gina has been going into recovery now. I think i'm gonna call it a day on things right now, but I think. I think we could, if I were to talk to them today and try to make plans for tomorrow, I think we could. They could offer me. A few I mean a few hours, this is. Not a whole day i'd saved maybe five or six hours we could all three of us could I mean, even if i'm just directing. We could get it done five or six hours, I think."
105.0,Provider,yeah possibly for for loads pick up loads there and backs maybe approximating maybe four hours hey man want to throw you some money. I need help moving it.
258.0,Patient,yeah.
105.0,Provider,"yeah so set an alarm in your phone, so you have no excuse for forgetting tonight. To talk to him."
258.0,Patient,I may even run into them on the way out of the apartment here shortly.
105.0,Provider,"that's fine. that's fine, but this is a backup you've got something in place in case what's going on with gina distracts you or something else distracts you."
258.0,Patient,yeah.
105.0,Provider,"yeah just go ahead and do that, even if you lose me here, you can always come back."
258.0,Patient,Okay.
105.0,Provider,"Can you imagine your daughter. Moving herself out of an apartment in the condition that you're in by herself, can you. picture your daughter moving. Can you picture. This double standard, you have for yourself."
258.0,Patient,yeah crazy.
105.0,Provider,"uh huh. it's the New Year, this is the kind loving thing to do for you, how can I do a safer job, including people in whatever i'm doing. Is would it be safer and healthier and better to include people I can pretty much tell you get there with you to this to this place, I swear i'm an end up hearing the same thing I don't want to bother."
258.0,Patient,"Oh no. The point of this place is to bother the hell out of everybody, for me, I need okay yeah."
105.0,Provider,don't make me get a release of information to ask them if you're doing it.
258.0,Patient,I will do that.
105.0,Provider,"Is he really though you're like no he pretty much toughing it out himself every like gotcha I got you. Okay. will say no, because this is pretty automatic for you. you're so excited about the handles in the room, so you can get around yourself. Let them know when in your wellness care say I am so prone to not even consider my limitations, I have just been this way my whole life feel free. To bond for me help. And to call me out on it. include that in the wellness plan. Tell them."
258.0,Patient,Okay.
105.0,Provider,say this bossy lady by therapist said I gotta tell you this.
258.0,Patient,"that's good. that's good that because. If I get that out. And they will know and. i'm going to show you i'm serious i'm serious I want this I want. I don't want to be. better than this to myself on. And i'm trying I am i'm just realizing how automatic, that is not. So i've got some rewiring to do some serious rewiring to do. But it's not on. me see. yeah I need to. look at things in a different way. Know i'm going to be thinking about this all day because you know here I am thinking i'm being i'm doing good and then. And then I you make me see that i'm just doing the same stuff here um. I do feel like. i'm on the right path, though."
105.0,Provider,You are.
258.0,Patient,And i'm not gonna. Say not gonna stop.
105.0,Provider,To get your. your eyes back um and.
258.0,Patient,"Oh, my feet hurt my. My foot, whereas in process to so everywhere, is a big month for me, actually, I may have. Well that's another matter, but February I should get my beats word away and my eyes and my and i'll be there every year, so. it's just. just be a big month for me, should have a lot of quality of life, improvement there. um. yeah. I just it just um. It just occurred to me why initially I didn't ask my nephew. We just had a. childhood friend of ours just just odd."
105.0,Provider,oh dear.
258.0,Patient,"That was Friday, I believe. and I know we were told, I was trying to help them with. With grief. And that may be the reason why I didn't it didn't occur to me to ask ask for, but, but I can do like I say. Make it into a job, where I can pay them, it just makes it all more simple. yeah we did have a brand that. really hard because of you know, last week I was just gave them the number to break our health and we were talking about about. Getting on suboxone and I, you know I just. talked with him about the program and what it did, for me, and it was he seemed like he was at the point where he. genuinely wanted to get some help and then. I think he probably. got something for new years or something wanted to party or something, and that was it so. Excuse me. i'm finishing my meeting."
105.0,Provider,What. Was that have to do with asking for help you tell me i'm making no assumptions.
258.0,Patient,I just. know it just didn't occur to me to ask him and I don't know.
105.0,Provider,There was an argument going on. that's pretty normal there.
258.0,Patient,"yeah okay. So. No i'm just trying to rationalize this stuff don't forget it does nothing. Because if I think of it in terms of. I could, I could pay him for. For jobs job then there's no reason why not to ask him any The worst thing to do is tell me I don't feel like it or no."
105.0,Provider,"hey what's another idea, then, and how much money talk about $50 or 2500 and how much money do you have."
258.0,Patient,Like 100 bucks 200 bucks.
105.0,Provider,Do you know even further out your nephews friends that you trust or friend of a friend that you could use 100 bucks.
258.0,Patient,yeah um. my daughter destiny's boyfriend yeah.
105.0,Provider,Just a nice.
258.0,Patient,that's a good one that's a good one.
105.0,Provider,write that down. Forget.
258.0,Patient,"I will forget I need I need to write it down. me. Decent. trust him. I could always ask my brother Martin, I mean because he. See, and then, but with him, it just I know he's so busy."
105.0,Provider,"And let him say no. stop trying to control the reactions and feelings of others, I know your intentions are just stare them but it's controlling. Let them have their own experience. Sometimes the answer's no let him answer you have been doing this other version. A long time. Come back and tell me that no one talked to you, oh you're so selfish and greedy, how could you ask me how could you ask me to help. So, aside from the psychosis happening with gina she's in she's in psychosis just straight can't see what's up. that she doesn't count. That doesn't count she. she's doing for survival reasons that. doesn't count. But everybody else would be like. What you don't have someone already helping you are you freaking kidding me they're all going to have. mouth breathing jaw dropping response. Just like mine. they're gonna be like what you don't have that worked out you like yeah. yeah I don't think like that I have about the energy and i'm so excited to have this place, I just like doing it and it didn't hit me that I might be doing damage, so I would love some help. dude. Are you telling me in for our you can be moved into your new place."
258.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
105.0,Provider,Three days are you kidding me.
258.0,Patient,you're right you're so right.
105.0,Provider,Quick quick kitchen.
258.0,Patient,With.
105.0,Provider,Two different people or whatever. it's good. Important stuff first and let's get you there.
258.0,Patient,yeah. And with that.
105.0,Provider,"Let marlon. Help or not help. Let your nephew help not help. Just. Do what you said, if you're. you're saying you're committed to this, this year, then you're going to need to do these things okay."
258.0,Patient,"yeah. I mean. figuring it out and saying it out loud and I I don't see any problem with it, like, I totally want to go say Come on, I. four hours you're right you're so right. It bugs me that it doesn't occur to me. i'm just stuck in this mode of just get it done and you'll be okay just just do it just get through it."
105.0,Provider,This so your approach to this one this time. is a bit of a cheat because you're doing it with money so that's fine go go do it because it's easier this way but. I don't know that that.
258.0,Patient,Because.
105.0,Provider,You can't quite see how much you give to people. How much you've given to so many people in your life. You can't see it.
258.0,Patient,"Here right when. You. got to me right there what you just said, because I guess I don't give you can't you're right. I feel like that's the right. thing for Bible belt like it's the right way for me to be or the right thing for me to do is give. Of myself whatever's needed I just. I really need to point that myself and. be there for myself."
105.0,Provider,"What you spare yourself. The potential pain. of people not seeing. What you've done you don't have to face it, you know you don't have to by doing this, your way. Because oftentimes the people that you've invested and given so much just keep holding their hand out because.
