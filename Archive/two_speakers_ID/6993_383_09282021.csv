6993.0,Patient,"Hello Okay, I should have double check this now, but is it Okay, that I went directly here or."
383.0,Provider,"Oh, you just talked to retro actively go back to the virtual clinic."
6993.0,Patient,"and tell them, I came okay. sounds good."
383.0,Provider,i'm sure you're in the middle of your.
6993.0,Patient,"yeah. I am, I had a i've been able to like schedule meetings around therapy today."
383.0,Provider,So you have a cod important conference you present it up.
6993.0,Patient,"yeah yeah I did um it was the needs Conference, which is the northern European emergency and disaster preparedness something Conference, and I was invited to speak because they like. My one first author paper hasn't been published, yet, but it's been through review twice so it's like any day will hear a pub like that it's been accepted, probably, it should be accepted, because it's a very like in vault process. But it was the issue that I wrote for. Is an early career researchers like issue, so they invited a lot of the people who are part of that to present at this conference, which was really cool, but the only thing is that, like since it was a Swedish northern European thing. Most of the really cool sessions were like in the middle of the night, for me, so I missed, most of the conference, but I was able to present up my session so. The Americans session that I presented in was like 8am my time and, like six or 7pm their time so like the very end of the day, and I was just waking up. But yeah so that went well there was a little bit of like zoom tech issue stuff but. there's been a lot of presentations lately but presenting is one of my strengths as long as I actually prepare as long as I like prepare and practice public speaking and talking are things that I can that I trust myself to do well. fabulous yeah there's not a lot of things that i'll be like I could do that but."
383.0,Provider,i'm happy to feel competent at.
6993.0,Patient,"yeah I think it's the years of working at a museum for like having to teach science for to strangers all day and then i'm just being in evolved and things that required a lot of speeches and stuff. yeah it's been less so, like in the pandemic because i've been so compelled like being away so we'll see if I do real public speaking again and rufus. yeah."
383.0,Provider,"yeah yeah that's great So what do you feel like you want us time for a time is somewhat limited, so I want to follow what you would like to."
6993.0,Patient,speak on yeah um I. I guess I I have dating problems we can work through. So lasts for a couple moves met a couple times since my breakup with Connor.
383.0,Provider,"yeah yeah last time I saw you, you were dating two different people I think and you're kind of couldn't really quite decide."
6993.0,Patient,"Yet and up until this weekend I was still kind of dating both of them. um so yeah I mean I okay there's a cash and ck those are their names and a cash was the one who's from fremont from the East Bay, he is a does like finance engineer, something you like just graduated. And he graduated in the spring and he still like lives at home, but we've went on a ton of dates, because you just drive to San Francisco. And, and we I liked him a lot like a lie, I think that he had to leave early had very similar energies i'm. Like I think he's really funny got along well he's very like Bay area, and I think that that that we just knew a lot of the same things of growing up in the same music and whatever else. But we had one really. Bad date on Thursday and I haven't heard from him since so i'm like I guess I didn't have to make a choice I think they just like disappeared. And then i'll brief you on ck because I think he's much like treats well I guess treats me better because we've had way more consistent communication and he seems much more secure in himself. But yeah so a caution, I have been talking off and on for not really often on but up until last week, and for two months and we went on four or five days they're like getting coffee watching movie in my house getting drinks like hung out at doors part with random things. But last week. I hadn't seen him for like two and a half weeks and we'd been texting a little bit and we'd facetime before and I had already mentioned, because I felt like he didn't reply quickly which. You know, I think that that's a constant thing about like figuring out how people communicate over text and, like. I don't i'm definitely not someone was unfair expectations there of like. reply immediately or whatever like I work, I have a life there's a lot going on, but you know, a couple of like if a couple of hours go by it doesn't take much to like send a quick reply because I know what it's like to like wait. And, and I thought about it, I was like that's enough that's enough of a reason to. not be with someone like how they choose to communicate, especially if they don't live super close to you if they live in like another city if you're a significant form of communication is going to be online or like over your phone you maybe want to like be comfortable with that. And I know I can do long distance because Connor and I were long distance for like. A year and a half or two years, so I know that you can still form like emotional bonds and whether or not you're like i'm in someone's face or not. But I figured I was like okay i'll give him the benefit of the doubt I can't like expect him to read my mind either, so I was like I need to at least communicate that like. I don't like your communication style not in that way, but it basically we'd face times and I was, like, I think that you, and I mean I didn't communicate it well because, like you take a really long time to reply. And I guess I didn't really describe how it made me feel, but I just like pointed it out, and I was like. I feel like I wait a lot or whatever and he's like Okay, I like this, like okay good to know like i'll work on that or whatever. And then. For last week, like last week we talked a little bit more, but it still is not like enough, as I would like. And then we have a date on Thursday were supposed to go to a little like wine bar CAFE in my area and and he was supposed to be here at like seven. For like 730 and then he was like half an hour late but part of the reason was he was looking for parking and Russian hill has horrible parking. on a Thursday evening. So you like drove around for a really long time and then he called me was basically like do you just want to like come outside and maybe we could figure out something else or go somewhere another neighborhood and those okay fine. But like it San Francisco on a Thursday if you're trying to like go to a cutesy place you're going to parking is going to be just like an issue. Like if we do North beach or Marina or whatever it's all going to be like a little inconvenient, so we ended up going to this like. place in mission Bay, which is still in the city, but it's like one of those like cutesy food truck places. Beer garden and there's all these different places, so we got food and yeah the. vibes were off as soon as I got in a car, and we were like I don't know what do you want to do where do you want to go like. And then we made he made the decision to go there and I said okay that sounds good, I haven't been there sounds fun, I was like trying to be open to it and then. By time you get there everything's like closing the like towards the end of the night like we had not too much time left there we didn't getting food and like sitting down and then things started to feel comfortable again normal again. And our conversations were fine and then we went on a little short walk and he basically just like dropped me off at home, and that was it um. We like I was leaving out of the car and still feel like as he's dropping me off, I didn't know if you like, wanted to come back or hang out or whatever. And, basically, I didn't I felt really weird about the whole situation and and was like Okay, I guess yeah it just dropped me off that sounds good i'll see you later. And I didn't realize it, but I like was ready to dip out of the car and then he was expecting that we're going to kiss which we have we've kissed most like a ton of times, where this point. After our dates, but I wasn't really feeling it, but I kissed him anyways Martin like it's, not that I didn't feel pressure to just like I didn't assume it because I think that, like. In other cases it's felt really natural and, in this case, it was just like this is how you ended date felt like. an awkward kiss. And then I haven't heard from him since. He follows me on instagram or we follow each other on instagram so i've seen that he's like watched my stories and he's liked the like posts that i've posted and. But he hasn't reached out, and I also haven't reached out and so part of it, too, is that, after our lasting it was similar where like a day or so and by knows okay I haven't heard from him. I should reach out like it's not a big deal for me to be the first to reach out if I want to see someone again. But in this case I was like the date was awkward. And the last couple of times I feel like i've been the one to initiate so like I guess if I. yeah so, then in my head, I told myself I don't know if this is good, but I was like if he doesn't reply back in X amount of days, then it's then i'll i'll never see him again I don't know if that's like a. Fair thing to make those types of. I don't know if it's making a boundary or if it's like testing, you know I think those I don't think they're the same thing, but I think it's fair to have. A boundary so basically I was like if it takes more than like four to five days of him responding, then I did not need it i'll just be like thanks you're great this isn't for me."
383.0,Provider,Right.
6993.0,Patient,I haven't even had the chance to like. End it because I haven't heard from him so. I think I might have been ghosted. I don't know.
383.0,Provider,"well. It sounds like that last date was. sort of situationally wasn't flowing and. And when that starts happening, then it's just like you're just not having a good time because you can't find a parking place and you, you go to a place to eat and it's closed or whatever you know. All those sort of situational factors start to contribute to people not enjoying their time. Go ahead."
6993.0,Patient,"And I yeah I thought about that I was like I think that maybe when it's early on those things feel lot heavier because i'm like I couldn't imagine if, like this word day with someone else, or if it had been a situation i'd experienced in like my longer term relationship. Right, none of that would have felt like a big deal, I would have been like wow that sucks whatever. Right, it was like. This is horrible."
383.0,Provider,"yeah yeah because you don't know each other that well and it's so it's sort of. You don't really totally feel comfortable with. Being a letting your hair hang out in terms of saying Oh, you know this is awful or this is kind of miserable or you know you're still trying to have a nice time you know and get to know that person. So it sounds like you're making maybe a wise choice by saying well if I don't hear from him in like four or five days that i'll just let that go, you know."
6993.0,Patient,"yeah um. Which and then I feel a little bit. Maybe, is it like sad or guilty, because I think that, like. The next day or two I like listen to some music and I was like this is so emotional This is like i'm feel like I want to reach out, but I know that, like, I know that I don't I shouldn't like. I want to initiate and I want to like see this person again, but I also know I don't want to be with someone who doesn't. isn't excited to already do that to you know um so I had to like reason it in my head and then I got fruit like sad about it right now i'm like not as sad about it, like whatever. But then I felt guilty because i'm i've still been seeing ck this whole time who like also who's a great great person and i'm like How would I feel if ck was grieving something else, and I was like oh man. And I guess, I never like for either of them at this point, which i'm going to ask ck now to like figure like can be a little bit more clear about whether or not we're exclusively seeing each other. um but in both cases I just assumed, they would also be dating people or that being exclusive wasn't necessarily important at those points. But now for two months and that's kind of a long time so. Maybe it wasn't one of them had to end it visually."
383.0,Provider,"Right right, so what so tell me a little bit about ck said."
6993.0,Patient,"ck yeah his name is like chaitanya coal or something I don't know how to pronounce the last name um but he goes by ck because it's. Okay, and he is lives in San Francisco he lives actually really close to me is like a 10 minute drive from me. And he's. Also, an engineer he. is much like a little more state well I don't know if he's emotionally stable that's a different thing but he's like a stable financially like he lives in a really nice apartment downtown he's a little bit older he's. Just turned 26 not that much older than me and 23 but little bit older there, and he. yeah what else about him he's an immigrant he is his family's from India his family lives in India, he moved here for college and then it's just stayed in the States since graduating. And then before that he went to like an international school so he's like I think very comfortable and familiar with like living abroad and away from family. And he's really nice he comes up with very thoughtful and interesting date ideas and like on our, for I don't know if I we talked about our first date but on our first date he, like brought me a rock. which I thought was really funny I was like that could be horrible coming coming to a date with a gift a first day with a gift is like kind of crazy I don't know. But it was very natural because we were like texting before and he was like I keep getting all these weird ads now and, like send me a screenshot of an ad that was like I like big rocks and I can live, just like a throw pillow. um and I was like oh God that's like um I was like yeah you could only imagine as like being someone who's into geology the weird gifts I get. um and he was like oh that's really funny and I was like oh so did you buy your pillow or like making a joke and he's like no I bought something worse and it's like but it's a surprise, and then we like went on a little date to this arcade bar place. And he, like I didn't get the rock until the end, and it was a really pretty rock but I was like i'm insulted that you thought this was a joke if i'm so I don't know he's like pays attention and he's very thoughtful. yeah and we went to SF moma and we've what else just done dinner, so I think we've we've been on fewer dates than the amount of dates, I went on, with a cost, because I think we did three three real dates and then last week and we just watch parks and REC. And this week I think i'm going to see him again at like some comedy place I don't really know I think comedy is a little overwhelming but i'm willing to try new things and. The."
383.0,Provider,"drawback suggestions is ck making this the date suggestions, you said that. He does tend to make funny or thoughtful suggestions about date where to go."
6993.0,Patient,"yeah yeah. um but they've been he's been like open to. Like making sure they're things that I enjoy too. So yeah he's seems like he also pays attention to the things I say like you will pay back repeat back things and you replies fast and isn't afraid to like. Start conversations, like, I can tell he's just trying to start conversations do sometimes by like sending a meme or like sin like I don't know he's putting in a lot of efforts i'm like that's feels very reciprocated and good and and the only thing is, he works, a lot. A lot a lot, and he, like cancelled, one of our dates, so that he could work now but that's fine one day is fine, but I know that that was a issue with me and Connor at some point of like. him overworking I think it's also like Maybe I should never stop just like stop dating engineers, or something. But that is a concern because he's like talked about asleep schedule and it seems pretty bad. And yeah so that's one one red flag there and and another thing is that he I think it's really excited about like big ideas which i'm like. that's also a red flag early on um because he likes to skydive and he's like do you want to skydive soon. And I was like yeah I want to skydive soon, but then I was like is that too soon didn't want to jump out of a plane with someone who i've only known for a couple weeks I didn't I would. But still i'm like I have should be cautious about because that's like expensive and a lot. But I still work on a plane so maybe."
383.0,Provider,"So he's. Suggesting like let's go do that, like. And he'll pay for it. yeah yeah."
6993.0,Patient,"um. he's paid for most things I paid for dinner once and he was reluctant, but I was like I invited you to this place, so I think it's fine that I pay. And so, he might have some like a gendered expectations of dating the way, I think, maybe a lot of people do, but maybe that's also the fact that I have like a date women too, so I think that for me it's a little bit more. I try not to be like you pay for this when you like open doors or whatever."
383.0,Provider,"Because. there's also the cultural component, I could come from India, I mean it's still such a patriarchal society so many amazing Indian women but it's there's still. A very, very strong. You know roles there."
6993.0,Patient,"yeah yeah that's definitely things i've seen with friends to in the past of just like. yeah being raised with those expectations and just like things that you're comfortable with. And, but I also maybe this is like me reflecting on relationships i've seen in my family and stuff I don't want to ever become like too reliant. On someone to pay for everything, and I want to like make that clear early on, and even though i'm sure he makes like much more money than I do, and i'm sure that, like it's not a big deal to him. But to me i'm like. No i've seen like."
383.0,Provider,You want to maintain your independence. yeah yeah.
6993.0,Patient,"um so yeah I liked him a lot he. yeah he's we're I think we're a little more different than like me in a cash where I think we had like a lot of. Very like easy compatible things and I think for ck he's pretty he's different and he's out there, and he likes adventure and I like adventure and I like he makes me feel comfortable and i'm happy around him. But our interests, I think, are different, like, I think the things that he really likes are a little bit different and so that's, the only thing i'm looking but I don't think it's bad I don't like different it's not bad, yet."
383.0,Provider,"Right right well the responsiveness of his. name is very different than a cash. You know, sponsored in his text he seems like he's. engaged he's initiating so there's not that aspect of things."
6993.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
383.0,Provider,very nice no.
6993.0,Patient,"yeah so and then I think in some ways to ending things, even if it is. unfortunate to like in something with someone without actually saying it directly, without like discussing it and it in some ways, at least lets me like put an energy into places where. Where like i'm also feeling secure in that space to you know. Which is good, but now i'm like I should probably check in with ck about what his expectations are. In terms of like are you seeing I don't think he's seeing other people, but. Also, now that i'm not seeing anyone else. I feel less scared about the. conversation which maybe is a little shady on my part. yeah so i'm like a huge if he asked me that I don't have to be like yeah like no."
383.0,Provider,"Right right well, I mean there's. nothing wrong with. That loud noise but. being honest. This thing of being honest and being straightforward you don't have to tell all of the everything you know. And so you, Sir, and it's I don't think it's wrong to be selective at this stage of the game, you know and saying you know you met them on dating Apps right on. yeah so yeah you've been dating you know you don't have to say, been dating this other guy he lives in the Bay area it's kind of great but it's also been kind of heat up. Here, but you can be honest and in in that, just like within that one domain of yeah you've been on a dating site and you get different people you're dating different people, but you really enjoy you know you're really enjoying time with him and. And you're wondering what where he thinks that this might be going or maybe not just in relation to you, but what he wants and his life."
6993.0,Patient,"yeah yeah and I was like ask that, in a way yeah like we like laid that out because I don't want it to be like, I want to be your girlfriend cuz I don't want to be his girlfriend, at least not yet, but I do want well."
383.0,Provider,"Then, maybe you don't even need to have the conversation yet."
6993.0,Patient,"yeah well I do Okay, I want to know if he's seeing other people. Because I think that will shape how invested I am you know. I think it yeah."
383.0,Provider,"But Okay, I guess i'm."
6993.0,Patient,Not mad.
383.0,Provider,"Well, no, I just. What is it that you want for yourself, like you, don't want."
6993.0,Patient,It.
383.0,Provider,You want to date different people you still kind of are maybe in that place of just wanting to meet other people and just kind of.
6993.0,Patient,yeah well.
383.0,Provider,In an exclusive relationship with Connor and now you're out of that and you're kind of meeting different people.
6993.0,Patient,"yeah I. yeah yeah I think that, for me, I. am excited about like meeting people because I also get to learn about myself um and, like the things that I like and it's cool to just like see. um I think it could be really fun to meet new people and go on dates and learn yeah about myself the things I like to do or the ways I communicate that's different. So there's that and so yeah, I guess, maybe I shouldn't preach it like start a conversation i'm not sure exactly. Where I would see things going with see katie so i'm just gonna yeah."
383.0,Provider,"yeah I mean if he was to turn around and ask you the same question what would be your reply in terms of even, even if it was a hypothetical this is hypothetical."
6993.0,Patient,"yeah I would be I mean i'm okay with that this one, because I i'm not super. dating after all so exhausting for all of the like different people you meet it's also like very overwhelming and exhausting and there's like hundreds of people and, like you're like oh my God that's like 100 different pathways. it's like. Good dopamine hit like yeah you, like me, like me and then it's like oh my gosh that's too much I don't know how to talk to anyone and. So I am at a place where. i've I know that I, like him, I know that we're compatible I don't want a serious relationship, yet I don't want to be like come meet my family come let's go travel the world like that's not what I want, but. I am comfortable with just seeing how things play out with just this one person for a bit and and feeling things out and focusing energies there, but I guess, in some ways it doesn't really matter to me if that's also. What he's doing, because I think i'll do what i'm doing either way you know um yeah yeah I think it would be unfair if i'm just like i'll see other people just because you're seeing other people because that's not what I want if it wasn't like. yeah."
383.0,Provider,If it wasn't like. You just stopped and then your sentence.
6993.0,Patient,"yeah I don't know, I think that. The only. person, I think I could have is even okay to say, but I think the only situation where I could have seen an. Ending things with ck was a things with a cash went like really well or something and and I guess vice versa, to you, like if things continue to go like went really well with ck eventually have to end things with the cost to um but. yeah so I don't want to really like start over I was not now but i'm also. Well aware that, like in this stage things changed by the day, or by the week and. yeah."
383.0,Provider,It seems overall like you're enjoying this kind of these kinds of these experiences of you know kind of meeting other people and. Having these little outings and just having fun.
6993.0,Patient,"yeah yeah overall it's been positive um. yeah I definitely feel weird about how things are ending with a caution, it feels like i'm glad that I did multiple people and i'm glad that, like I. Get too invested. And, but in some ways, I feel like that's a little sad because it's it's reassuring the parts of the like the bad things that I think about people when it comes to data to have like. That people ultimately don't care that much or like they don't. it's not that important to them, and I think that for me there's a way of seeing something that is not super not as like a your biggest priority, but still like respecting it and appreciating that. Which is where i'm at I think dating is not like the number one thing i'm doing in my life but. For the people that I get to be with I want it to be something that like at least I respect them and i'm excited about them um. yeah so then if i'm like guys just suck and then they disappear and it's not that important to them and then they're this like amazing person, and then they just like one bad day and you don't see them American. reassures those like."
383.0,Provider,"That people don't care that much and it's sort of a superficial. yeah for and yeah and that's I think that's what sort of like the underside of dating you know that's the the dark side of it. You know you get someone oh it's so they're they're cool and interesting and you think they like you and then and then something happens and they go away and you kind of feel like yeah I think that that's just kind of. The darker side of. Really kind of playing with intimacy you know when you've got intimacy going that requires a lot of trust. yeah and. Then and you're late you're sort of moving in the direction of you know, the big trust which is like marriage and children and. That takes a lot of trust and and so you're you know that's what the I mean. date people date each other for all kinds of reasons but but it's hard to avoid that that's also in the picture is just this level of intimacy that's just innate and human beings I."
6993.0,Patient,"yeah and the other things that with a cash on the date beforehand, we like spent hours, it was so like we spent hours and hours together like went to the park had bobo is great, we came back to my apartment we cuddled We talked for a long time, and I think in those moments I like. I like I, like you, a lot, I think your personality is perfect love, like all of the like whatever beautiful amazing things that you want to hear in those moments, and then in the back of my mind being me being like. um they say like this person says they like you love like don't fully trust it and then. A couple weeks later, you don't hear from that person and i'm like oh man that like little doubt voice was right or maybe that's like what I but I don't want to lead with that either because I want to be able to like. I know, and then it's like it's two bigger deeper issues, but like. I think i'm really well well aware of like I think i'm hyper vigilant with red flags which could be an issue, but I just want to avoid relationships, like the ones, my mom is that are the ones like my aunt's have had and and I think that for. I think it's a good thing that i'm ready to like pack up and leave when things go wrong, but I also think that that can be a bad thing too because, to some degree, because I don't want that to let me hold back in those instances of someone telling me that they like me. Because I want to simultaneously be able to trust those things. yeah but then maybe I shouldn't trust those things, because then these people reassure like shoot I don't know."
383.0,Provider,"yeah yeah yeah that makes sense, makes a lot of sense that ambivalence and why and and knowing that you want to. You know, you want to step forward on a solid ground in the for the law, you know. And right now probably you two are not fully ready to. Be in a that kind of relationship it's just going to be like a full on trust, like we're going to you know be fully committed to one another. yeah you may not be ready for that as well, right now, yeah but you're also protecting yourself from emotionally getting really you know. Attached not our dependent or expecting you know that connection."
6993.0,Patient,yeah yeah. um but what I have seen is that all I don't know it's been true with all the people that i've gone on dates with or have dated in the past that they always weasel their way back into your inbox back into your day. So i'm just hoping that I have like the the that I stick to my guns them like I don't just be like God because.
383.0,Provider,"I know I know it's very tricky it's very tricky. very tricky when you like, a person. yeah yeah it's kind of. it's. i'm sorry I don't have anything. To say. But I think you're you've got you know I think it's a good thing that you're on alert as well, while you're you know, trying to meet people I think it's wise. yeah yeah."
6993.0,Patient,and
383.0,Provider,Because you do want to create a different life for yourself and then it seems like your mom and your aunt had.
6993.0,Patient,yeah yeah so.
383.0,Provider,possible and if it's possible.
6993.0,Patient,"yeah I just um. yeah I think that that's real and I think that the one of the things i'm remembering remembering that's frustrating about dating new people is that some people approach dating with like the less I care, the more like. Power there I don't know there's weird power dynamics, I think that can develop and which is why i'm like need to X out the cost from the situation entirely, especially when I was such an amazing person like right there um but. I think that, like people get close and then they pull back and they get close to them, they pull back and. In those situations where i'm just like waiting for someone to reply or waiting and I don't know he feel like really insecure and then here's less is winning and I don't want to win or lose in that you know."
383.0,Provider,"Right right right, and one thing and I don't know this could be totally my projection is that. Is that Indian men. seem like they are more rooted in being comfortable in relationship like it's not like, for us, I think, American or people that have been born and raised in the US, whether or not, as recent are long. there's something about. The comfortability and relationship that seems less. Has a less of a wellspring of role models, or just tradition or I don't know what, but that was just my feeling when I went to India, and I saw. Families and couples and men, and they just seemed more comfortable in relationship they seemed like they were doing that much with much more ease than seems like American men do."
6993.0,Patient,"yeah I talked seeking i've talked a little bit about that and just because he's like Indian weddings are huge thing and like. being married is explained that, like people like save up the same way, they save up for college. For their like children's weddings that last like weeks of celebration, and whatever else, and so it makes sense that, like that being culturally embedded would shape your own expectations, but then simultaneously is also explained it as like. he's like well i've seen my own parents and think that, in some ways, those expectations like keep people together when maybe they'd be happier apart, too, so like I think that there's like a flip to it to have like this is just what people do. which in some cases, you know means that they're like really happy and comfortable new relationships and then in other situations it's like this is just as much of my job is my job is my job, you know. yeah but I mean, I think that yeah. I yeah I think that that's interesting to getting to date, people from different backgrounds and places and. yeah."
383.0,Provider,"yeah well i'm so i'm looking at your chart and there's a few red dots. So the red dots are the BAM survey, which you know that is not in relation to you, but it. To make the.go away and turn Green, I think that that's that's a substance use survey and I don't think it's related to I don't think you're really required to do it, but if you wanted your chart to be all green, then, and then the patient satisfaction survey. Okay, and. So."
6993.0,Patient,"Okay. damn survey in patients of spectrum I forget the surveys all the time and I don't think i've ever not been read I think i'm always in the I mean I yeah I don't. yeah I think i'm always in the bad zone, because one of them is every other week, and one of them is to have them or every week or they all every week."
383.0,Provider,"So let's let's let's get that straightened out, I think that.

6993.0,Patient,"that's true, but then I missed, one which then like since it's every other week. I missed, one that i'm supposed to be at, and then it became like a big gap in between, because if it's every other week, then I didn't want either so."
