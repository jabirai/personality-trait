18089.0,Patient,"All the time because they didn't ask me those questions whenever I went to pay management, I guess they'd have never got asked that question so. really know every once in a while like I say about once a year, they will produce this work where you have to fill out like a mental thingy and you checked out, I think one of the questions was like you feel like harming yourself anybody, but. It wasn't fake alert like on a regular basis, like the way we are doing it."
499.0,Provider,"yeah they have they might be, because they might have a little bit different um guidelines and we have been pain management, but being that we're in the middle health sector is required to always ask. yeah, just like the doctors offices now are required to always ask you if you're in pain. uh huh yeah the the suicidal or homicidal ideation is that that that that fire pain question for melville."

I i'm having problems with it, but my son told me there was something that I can do to so that it picks my birthday versus this year, like it'll it'll be 2022 it'll show 2022 and then you can go backwards, but that's a lot of going backwards if you know. That he showed me that there was something I could do to the it'll pick my birthday, but I got to ask him again because I forgot, I tried to do what he told me, it is not working out. for that. reason I would have had it done already."
