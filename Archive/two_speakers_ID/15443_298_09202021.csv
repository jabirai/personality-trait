298.0,Provider,Okay. How about hospitalized patients.
15443.0,Patient,"When I was about I don't know how that was exactly because one one more says to my answers, nine months, but when I was a kid I broke my femur off the back of a truck."
298.0,Provider,Oh wow. Is your biological mother and father still alive.
15443.0,Patient,"anymore, but my deathbed."
298.0,Provider,"Okay, when did your dad died."
15443.0,Patient,I was 22 years old. 12 years ago.
298.0,Provider,"Okay. All right. So how micro dosing works, the benefit of my producing is when you are taking fentanyl it can get into your fat stores and it can take like four days to leak out and it can put you into withdrawals, for a long time. glide there has a pharmacy that will help you micro dose so you continue to use the Fed know as you normally have but you also start using the. And every day, it has the regime that on day one, you use two milligrams and you know and and by the seventh day you're able to transfer over to suboxone. Is this something that interests you."
15443.0,Patient,"yeah, I would like to try that mean. Does that when I I got arrested about couple months ago. And even before I was on fentanyl i'm doing heroin heroin right. And when I go to jail, I tried to cuz I got some suboxone from a funding and try to get on it and I finally using enough withdrawals, where I tried it and I don't I took I think. Like one I remember one and a half, maybe strips but didn't fully cover me that's what i'm worried about. And now I was that was my was less with less at that time. I think I. Think, I still have a little bit of a withdrawals."
298.0,Provider,"Okay, well, I love that you, you know about precipitated withdrawals and so i'm going to call, I have to call in this kind of prescription I can't even. put it into our system. But in that three days i'm going to want to see you again to make sure that you were taking it and then you'll get more medicine and then eventually, you will get on to a schedule have seen me."
15443.0,Patient,This micro dosing How does it work.
298.0,Provider,So. The pharmacy.
15443.0,Patient,"know the person was like you know if the city, does it is or anything."
298.0,Provider,I do know Pacific but you're going to get that at the pharmacy they're going to give you the specific specific day by day dosing and they're going to bubble packets so it'll be easy for you to.
15443.0,Patient,have a pretty good. pretty good history of working without don't be one this precipitate I can talk to you a little bit more about that too yeah.
298.0,Provider,"So far, so far i've had those who go on it have said, I would say. i've had about an 80% success rate of people saying it's kept them I i'll get 100% if people will follow the directions and actually do it."
15443.0,Patient,"Right, so I mean I read about it, I read about a long time ago, actually micro dosing before it actually probably was even a thing with them i'm part of websites for a website called la and. The Members on there pretty knowledgeable about opiates and that's something that he but a couple people were doing, they would you know, instead of having to go through withdrawals because they were on methadone or something three days. Is a long freakin time and, like all right, keep that is almost impossible like."
298.0,Provider,methadone can be the worst. To go to to come off of so. I totally get that it's different because methadone is a full agonist where a blip in our field is a partial agonist.
15443.0,Patient,The mixed.
298.0,Provider,Mixed mixed.
15443.0,Patient,Mixed agonist and.
298.0,Provider,I thought it was a partial agonist.
15443.0,Patient,"When it becomes an antagonist after a certain amount of those. unlocks a minute well because that's what people think. I could be wrong, but um I know that we have an orphan below two milligrams and then you have nor buprenorphine which metabolized when people number. two milligrams is a full agonist I mean we will receptors but after that becomes the block, but what it is, is a partial activator partially activates your preceptor it doesn't actually fully that nobody gets I often."
298.0,Provider,"say yes, it is pretty unique all right um she's going to explain it further i'm going to call in the first three days into your pharmacy okay."
15443.0,Patient,"All right, thank you."
298.0,Provider,Thank you. bye bye.
15443.0,Patient,"Okay, so the way that it works with. With. A very. specific way that it works. um. that there are other like opiates that. suboxone or other between our friends like will take those withdrawals away right away, whereas that mall like sits there a little bit longer and some. People who use that and I will notice that they'll actually go into a much worse worse withdrawn if they just hate. suboxone regular be perfect right so with the micro dose it's basically like it's like a warm handoff to. to your body right so it's like hey so we're going to slowly take this thing away, while introducing this into your body. And so the pharmacist will talk to you too, because some people will take ticket once a day in smaller amounts some people take it twice a day and smaller i'm not sure if other people would take it more or less so you'd have to talk to. Like the pharmacist and be like this is how much i'm taking this is how much you're taking this now and it'll kind of. switch off right. So, as long as you are able to. Stick to like the limit of the fentanyl and the suboxone and like kind of switch them in spots, you should have. Because the moment that you get that threshold we've been open as it has a stronger opinion and Funnily enough, one of the highest entities removed which other people. And when that when when you're still take advantage it's going to rip it off their centers and it will replace it that's why it is an antagonistic yeah I get. It becomes an antagonist until all depend on each other, your your body pretty much withdraw from the window open on your system, then you can become an active. flag saying so you're agonized at this level right, you have this level of activation and then you have your preceptor right uh huh down regulation, so you have very little. yeah I wish Jason was available Jason understands this like whole science of it really, really well and I, I understand the science of it, but not anywhere near the level of early do you can often when they're in within. It was still, but these are lots of it's not it's actually stronger than an hour. Now awesome can you how can I don't I mean I don't know anything about about that being I mean i've heard of people doing that. But i've also learned a lot, a lot of. A lot of a lot of things that people talk about on the streets that are true and a lot of things to talk about on the streets, that are not true. Well, that is very wise of you."
