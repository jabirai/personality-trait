So it looks like the last time you. Did that assessment was January 12 2022. let's look at. That score and let's see how you feel about it did it capture what you feel represents your depression or anxiety so. pH Q nine is really screening for depression i'm gonna give you example first two questions okay. Over the last two weeks How often have you been bothered by any of the following problems so little interest or pleasure and doing things you said several days feeling down and depressed or hopeless you set several days. trouble falling and Stan asleep nearly every day feeling tired a little energy more than half the days feeling bad about yourself several days trouble concentrating several days okay so, and so the pH Q. Nine on that day was a nine and that equal mild depression, how do you feel about that school that scores that do you think that's truly how you feel or what would you say about that score. Was 12 i'm sorry 12 so that's moderate depression sorry toil."

191.0,Provider,"So, would you agree with that Okay, so that schools with toys Okay, so you agree with that and unless look at the gates seven that looks at anxiety okay. Over the last two weeks How often have you felt nervous anxious or age. To overhead two days over the last two weeks off and have you not been able to stop or control worrying over half two days. You also said over half the days in terms of worrying too much about different things over the last two weeks How often have you had trouble relax and you say it nearly every day. or also over the past two weeks have you been bothered by being so races hardest it sit still you said several days. or being easily annoyed or irritated you sit several days are filling of free it as of something awful my habit you sit several days these things, it was difficult. for you to work or take care of things at home and get along with everyone other people, you said that was somewhat difficult, so you get seven score was a way of and that that puts you at least some moderate anxiety, how do you feel about that."

16628.0,Patient,So.
191.0,Provider,"We want you to have a good diet, where you get in fruits and vegetables about four to five servings a day of varieties, I say broccoli corn carrot. kale just a variety, every day, getting you some lean meat, I like some fish chicken baked foods, because what the evidence is showing on this Elizabeth is how we eat affects our mood. Okay, so unhealthy diet this field, a lot of processed foods like if you only eat now, and he do only doing burgers and Fries. You got to be really careful that's not going to. Support positive mental health so. One quick sans sal say with my patients if if. You look at your plate look at you played every day if it's only Brown and white you're not eating right. If all you see is Brown and white you're not eating right so should be popping with some calls not from. Skills okay. Not from those Barbecue lay's potato chips when we say read okay want some vegetables and some fruits, to make it pop what color OK. So the diet, I want you to look at is the Mediterranean diet Okay, so that was a diet, where people that you know live close to the Mediterranean Sea um they found those individuals often have. longer life. And so they've done some preliminary testing when they looked. At components of the Mediterranean diet and with the Mediterranean diet there's all levels it's not a bunch of fried fatty foods. Not a bunch of red meat but more of a whole food type nice Oh, I want you to Google Mediterranean diet and I want you to try to adopt several of those. principles at the Mediterranean diet low salt lower fat healthy fats, the facts that you get from like an olive oil, your avocados mobile plant based not palm kernel more of a plant based okay. Okay, and also exercise not you don't we don't have to, but you don't have not superwoman okay. But likes a walk in 30 minutes not days. We get not in the sunlight lightweight resistance, even if you two pounds just carrying some of those even if you can do some basic push ups that really helps with that upper body. So we're not saying you have to transform and become superwoman overnight, but."
16628.0,Patient,slow and consistent.
191.0,Provider,"In general exercises Okay, let me i'm going to go ahead and do your Sarah cool now what i'm going to do with this Sarah coil instead of star new at a high dose i'm going to start with 50 milligrams you can take one to two at night and will slowly ramp you up okay. Okay yeah and i'll get you back up to be 200 milligrams twice a day, then we'll look at adding one like stair stepping it okay. All right, but yeah because sometimes I still like when people been off the medicines to start at a lower dose and walk you up slowly and then just add the medications instead of all of it at once all right. And so we'll start seroquel will do anywhere from 50 to 100 milligrams at night. All right, the it will add on other mates so we're at, on the other, myths will add on the definitely will add on a trezza don't. And they will err on the side on Prozac okay."

Okay Okay, so I want you to watch, for your mood if you have any thoughts upon me yourself or. anyone else. Please let me know if you start to feel more anxious if you start to have any movement concerns. Please be aware that you want to watch it has an effect your stomach doesn't make you lightheaded and dizzy at the monitor for the weight gain.
