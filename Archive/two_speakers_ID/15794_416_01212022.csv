416.0,Provider,"i'm two years it was right after Grad school I moved out there. I was working as a I was running an Adoption Agency right, so I have like nothing to do with the entertainment world, and so I would go out and hang out and. I would find at that, like because I wasn't connected to that world at all I just couldn't relate to people I just had a really hard time connecting with people I definitely remember and I had moved from New York to La so. So it's like this is really weird because in New York, I didn't have any. yeah. So tell me a little bit, and I know that you have your dad lives in Alabama you'd have a relationship with him. And I just get a little bit, so it wasn't much in your chart about how you grew up in or you grew up in. In Germany and Alabama. It with your dad who was in the military."

Not at all, far from it, but I think it's maybe more so just mental I don't I have no idea."
416.0,Provider,"Well, you know extreme stress can do a lot of crazy crap to people. Right, I mean it can push you over the edge extreme grief extreme stress. Especially if you are. If you don't have a healthy way to express those feelings right if you bottle them all up or you, you know you aren't you don't feel safe expressing them they come out all at once, and some pretty ugly ways. How we're emotions expressed in your family growing up."
15794.0,Patient,"They weren't really I don't know that I remember, like a lot of it like day, but sometimes like random conversations will make me like remember certain things, but I don't really think we like expressed ourselves. Like I remember my brother was younger they put him in therapy. But it didn't really work and no it didn't work. They never really talked to us about how we felt my dad my dad. Was there like physically, but he wasn't like mentally. And he thought he was like even now like. He told my brother, one day, he went with my brother before he came out here for Christmas and he was like yeah and he's telling his girlfriend like I remember. He wants them are all of and he was a great student that are my brother and everyone was elementary school when we got to the states, I want to know all of so like he'll put different memories in his head and like I don't know it's weird. huh so, but he also. Like struggles, with some ptsd and stuff so I don't think he tries to do that it's just like you really just doesn't remember."
416.0,Provider,Absolutely yeah yeah yeah a lot of that can be can be trauma for sure.
15794.0,Patient,"So we try to. I think we're like understanding more, but like we were younger, just like. Like what is he talking about you know. So."
416.0,Provider,Have you ever had any suicide attempts. know or what about like suicidal thoughts or ideation.
15794.0,Patient,"I mean it was like a thought, but it was not really a thought it was just like what if there was just like no like. For me it's not. That serious for me to like just want to. You know off myself but. I do get like super super anxiety you're super stressed out or like sometimes just depressed because. I guess like feeling not wanted like growing up and then like also coming out here, and like what the dating scene and like Carol friendships were going is just like dangling you know. Harsh yeah."
416.0,Provider,"When you get anxiety or depression well we'll start with one we'll start with the anxiety part. Like what happens to you do you kind of shut down, do you have panic attacks like what what does that look like, for you."
15794.0,Patient,"um before like when I was in Alabama had like. Oh no I thought I was having like a heart attack or something. I don't know cuz I I used to have high blood pressure, so I was like Okay, maybe something's off with that and I went to the cardiologist and she put me on a heart monitor for a few days, and she said, I was just anxiety so like she didn't diagnose me, but she."
416.0,Provider,Had a panic attack.
15794.0,Patient,"For sure you know, like i'm looking in like it's normal it's just you're having a panic panic attack, but it was just like repeatedly and I didn't even know it. Like i'm sleeping and, like my hurts like you know just racing there the case may be, so i'm now it's kind of better. But I know, like my mind is like I can't think straight Have you ever seen that episode of sponge Bob where like he was inside of his brain and he was just like going crazy and it was just like burning a lot of paper and like that's how I feel like."
416.0,Provider,I love that you just Compare that to sponge ball. Okay that's actually really good description.
15794.0,Patient,that's helpful just can't like it's like I just can't think and then my brain is just like. Burning all this paperwork like just you know and then it's just blank like I just can't I can't think straight.
416.0,Provider,And when did this particular these symptoms start for you.
15794.0,Patient,"um I think when I got out here like it changed from like like my heart racing to like I just i'm trying to control it, I guess. As much as I can, and then, sometimes I just feel like super overwhelmed."
416.0,Provider,"yeah that makes sense, OK. And then, so are you still having the panic attacks or was it kind of just that period or."
15794.0,Patient,Like lover.
416.0,Provider,"yeah where you feel like you're like having a heart attack, where you sort of like shut down."
15794.0,Patient,"No, I haven't had that didn't like a long time."
416.0,Provider,"So now it's more so, it sounds like some like brain fog some confusion you kind of shut down. Does it still do you still feel your heart racing make sense I."
15794.0,Patient,"mean they kind of like a little like anxious he, like kind of faint but not like. Like before literally I could see like my chest like kinda. Like and I don't know that was so."
416.0,Provider,"scary. And then to depression you describe. What does that look like, for you."
15794.0,Patient,"um I don't know it just feels kind of like. I just feel like a failure, I guess, like I just and I get in these like stuck moods like where it's just like I feel just stuck like everywhere lap I just feel stuck you like I can't move I. can't go anywhere. And I tried to like. hang out with my friends more when I feel like that, because when i'm by myself, like I just you know it's not good like I just feel really, really, really bad so i'm trying to like I don't know i'm just trying different ways too late. go about it in like get through it not over it, no."
416.0,Provider,"All right, um. And then I see a reference in your file about. Some sexual abuse that you experienced."
15794.0,Patient,"Yes, but."
416.0,Provider,"The elaborate way. To are you in a place where you feel like it's Okay, for you to talk about that, just a little bit."
15794.0,Patient,"So let's hear it was so crazy, I had a dream and then I talked to him about the stream and she was like. Tomorrow that's like not a dream that's real life, like. And this preacher. He was like kissing me like in the lake he I remember like he came to visit my parents, because my parents were preaching at one point. He came to visit us and then like he greeted all of us, and then like hit kiss me and I was just like what like I was just thrown off."
416.0,Provider,"Then, when did that did that."
15794.0,Patient,There was a preacher.
416.0,Provider,preacher okay.
15794.0,Patient,"And then, when he left he tried to do it again and I just like kind of like push them away, but I don't know why I wish I would have told my parents I don't know why I didn't."
416.0,Provider,mean there's a lot of good reasons why people don't.
15794.0,Patient,And I think i'm not gonna lie. Really really glad I didn't because my dad would have gone crazy. and
416.0,Provider,against him.
15794.0,Patient,"Yes, I know he would have because my dad does not play about. Like you know I don't know if you know, but like military. Families, like the my dad he's one of those stickler like military man like. I do not play about my daughter's especially. You know, different things like that so. um yeah that happened and I talked to my mom and. She was like he actually like if you were to see him now like his Facebook he's with like. Some woman and they just look strung out like his eyes look like really like I don't know he just doesn't put together because wife divorced him. And my mom said they were like a lot of allegations, because he was our pastor in Germany and then like a lot of us got station to the States, at the same time. We went to their church for a little bit, and then I never realized why we all like my parents fell off with them, but it was just like a lot of like other things going on, but my mom said it was a lot of those type of allegations against them so. I just never. I never even remembered that until. randomly one day I just had a dream about it. interesting and then last year, one of my like clothes sky friends, I was at his house and we were like drinking on wine. or champagne is one of them either way it goes we weren't drunk it was like one bottle it was like for us so that's like you know not really a lot of liquor. And so we're all like I stayed at their house before like their guys, but like we've slept in the same bed like drunk like nothing's happened like we all used to just hang out like during the pandemic, we all, just like be you know at the House with each other so. He our other friend left to go pick his mom up from the airport and i'm just like how i'm going to sleep. On the couch and he was like you know walking around like cleaning up and stuff and then like he just keeps like touching me and he starts like. You know, helping me and i'm just like like stop he's like you know you want it like saying all this i'm just like no like stop like stop no means no. And then, finally, my other homeboy gets back and so he finally gets off me and I just felt so like I was so uncomfortable and my situation at home, like where I lived at the time I didn't have parking of street parking and you know the street parking is like it can be. yeah so. And i'm me in the parking people. Were be fan I have so many tickets. So i'm like at this point like you know I can't risk in another ticket so like I stayed at night over there on the couch because I was like you know, like it's like three four in the morning. So I stayed and he wants his room, thank God, my other homeboy like came and like. just watch TV with me and went to sleep on the couch with me so like I felt more comfortable because my. Other friend was there, but the next morning I took some about it. And he said i'm sorry for being rude. i'm sorry for being rude."
416.0,Provider,"rude rude is. I don't know belts, you get the table just not not sexual assault."
15794.0,Patient,"yeah and I was like no means no he was like yeah I was a little drunk and i'm like no, you were in he at the time, he was messing around with one of my best friends. So, before I even told her like I was just trying to like put everything together because. I was like okay like maybe he just in, and I was like no like that's not okay like no means no I don't care if I say no laughing I don't care if I say no. Like seriously no means no, you know that was trying to like my Defense mechanism was like he offered me like you know, like it's like if I keep saying get off of me like i'm not interested, get off me."
416.0,Provider,"Well, you should only have to say it once. it's really not okay."
15794.0,Patient,"And so after that he actually it was weird he takes a friend was like you know we never actually like go out. Let me take you to dinner, and it was so weird that he said that. And then actually like a quarter and soda what happened is she was a way just randomly asked me to go eat like we don't do that. And then she told him, she was like no like some area told me what happened, like you're weird and he just read your message left turn red. And then mine he left me on read too, and I was like that's not being rude like the sex, sexual assault like need to understand like no means no. He left me i'm read, then I told my homeboys I told all my homeboys about it because i'm just like I like i'm comfortable talking about it because I feel like y'all should know. yeah homeboy is weird that he's like very aggressive with women. and his roommate I think he's just didn't want to get in between it because he kind of needs him like he's the. He has a lot of money so like he's an investor something so he they have an apartment together, my friend his credit isn't good enough to get one on its own right now, so I think he just doesn't want to mess up his own situation which I can. yeah I understand. That told him and. He just kind of like brushed it off a little bit I guys. But they. He said that like he's always trying to get us to talk. And he's like we all need to have to sit down and i'm like no like if somebody came to me with that, like if I ever did that, to a guy. I would first of all immediately like call them, you know, like i'd be like very adamant about like getting this resolved, you know somehow and it's like he said sorry for being rude. And then he said so you don't want to be my friend anymore, I remember that he was a so you don't want to be my friend anymore so we're not we're just not going to hang out anymore, it was one of those two."
416.0,Provider,yeah and friends don't sexually assault friends so you're not my friend yeah.
15794.0,Patient,"And I haven't seen him since middle of the year, no."
416.0,Provider,"Sorry tomorrow. that's. yeah that is a lot of travel so. All of this, you move to La you have that happen struggling with friends your parents get divorced your dad attempt suicide. we're in the middle of a pandemic. Right like yeah you're going to be going through it, of course, with all of that going on it's no wonder. You you've that's a lot, and especially in a really short period of time. The."
15794.0,Patient,"biggest thing like I can understand that happened to spread out I can deal with that, but like it's just back to back to back to something."
416.0,Provider,"that's too much for anyone. Here lately so i'm glad you came. And then also you know parallel of that with growing up in a family, where emotions aren't really expressed right and you didn't have models for how to manage emotions. As they come up. and not to blame your parents or anything that's pretty typical actually especially military families and they probably didn't have those models either so they didn't know so they couldn't teach you."
15794.0,Patient,were actually worse so they're actually way better than their parents was just. Like my dad would just be and then my mom would just watch like she never really said anything so it's like that saying a lot and and so. You know so. there's.
416.0,Provider,"No exact you didn't get the the models and the skills. and actually considering that you're doing her marketable job. Thank you, like being okay and holding it together. But yeah it's understandable given the circumstances that you've been through in the last couple years. That you'd be really struggling absolutely. So I think we can help and. When like, if you think of. If you were like all better. I know that that's not like really a complete thing, but here you're like all fixed. What would what would be different like How would you feel different what would look different in your life right like where where do we want to get to."
15794.0,Patient,But mentally just mentally.
416.0,Provider,"mentally physically like. educationally and just whatever it is right, like what's, on the other side of this that you're hoping to get to."
15794.0,Patient,"All in all, I want to be like more consistent like modeling that's all I want to do, I just want to be able to just model. Be more happy i'm actually lately been been very happy, just like less worried about like money and things that just realized like. New diet that we can't take it with you, you know, though, like just I mean be smart about it but um but, just like being happier my family just having way better relationship. And then, like I want them to like work on themselves too because. They my dad calls me all the time, like stress and I had to like I kind of went off on him when he came out here like I don't want to keep hearing about this divorce you're out here to get your mind off of it like. So I just wanted to be like we're all like in a better mental space to not just deal with one another, another and tolerate each other, but like really just want to be around each other. Because my brother he still struggles with actually talking to anyone in my parents, so I want us all to just be not a big happy family but, like a big happy family, you know."
416.0,Provider,"Well, and. And there's only part of that that you can manage right that you have control over and that's you. But a lot of times what happens in a family, because families are tight knit systems right like just like any other system is when one part of the system grows and changes the other parts will adjust as well. And so it may be that the very active you getting a lot healthier will have that desired impact on them. Maybe you can't control it. We can't say for sure it's going to happen, but you start to provide the model for that. not truly healthy enough family system."
15794.0,Patient,"I can see both of my parents. Taking a lot for me like. My dad like I have tattoos and stuff and he came got tattooed and. Had drinks and he's dressing different and. Like a lot of things that I do like he does like he'll call me and be like hey like i'm juicing and i'm like I just every morning. And he's like juicing and he's going out to different bars and who, like semi different music that he says, am that the bar or something is no like he's you know getting out more and then my mom. she's in London right now randomly. But, just like live in life I was like my sister is still home she's she's not going anywhere. And then my brother wants to DC but i'm the one that like I went off to Texas, to go to school, my first two years and, like I drove from Alabama here all by myself. 29 hours and i'm about to go to New York for myself and like I just do a lot of things like that, and so my mom is like doing that and, like like I got my nipples pierced a few years ago, and she did it and I was just like what in the world. Come on, but like I would have never thought they would do these things so like I can see them like kind of. Living. More because of me I guess."
416.0,Provider,"Not me, it sounds like have a pretty strong influence on them. yeah and so often the best thing we can do it, so we can't make people other people do things but just simply providing that example and sharing their journey and is a big has a big impact on people at the very least, I would say, like plants, a lot of really healthy seeds. and"
15794.0,Patient,You see that.
416.0,Provider,"i'm just making sure that we're scheduled yeah good you've got scheduled for twice this month already perfect. um. Alright, so what i'm hearing in terms of goals is to. Just feel better."
15794.0,Patient,If you learn more stuff go.
416.0,Provider,"And to strengthen your relationships and provide like an example of good emotional and mental health, for your family. Did that back capture it. yeah Okay, so the how, how do we accomplish that and I mean this is where I come in right. Is. A lot of skill building really and some of it is going to be. And i'm not going to make you journal."
15794.0,Patient,"Okay, good."
416.0,Provider,"I hate. hate it. I always ask people first like are you a turtle or you're not some people love it. i'm not journal or there. But you don't have to be that's the good news we have other ways of doing things. So the how i'm thinking. All. I mean I we're definitely going to build skills right so there's skills around. First of all, really just tuning yourself and paying attention to destructive or negative thoughts. arrow. shooting the whole room with your scratching, can you please stop. that's enough. My co therapist is scratching his ears. So there's a lot of skills around. Around emotion regulation right it's like when things come up, how do we express them in healthy ways, how do we tune into them. How do we make sure that these emotions that are very natural that come up in US don't turn into destructive thoughts and negative thoughts, a lot of times we judge our own emotions it happens all the time consciously. And how to kind of interrupt Those sort of destructive thought patterns when they do happen and push back on them a little bit. And then I hear a lot of trauma in you so. I think a lot of it is going to be processing through some of that the trauma and making sense of it in a way that helps you sort of move through it and get on the other side because you also have a ton of strength, you have a strong social support network. One thing i'm hearing from you really consistently is assertive communication, which is actually really hard to teach but people who have it do really well in this world. And i'm hearing like there's a lot of examples in your life that you've given me to send that short period of time, where you are really good communicator you speak up for things you need and want and you set boundaries. You set a boundary with your dad when he came out and visited like that we're moving through this we're going to move on right. it's all really healthy stuff that we can build on."
15794.0,Patient,Okay. It makes me feel better.
416.0,Provider,"yeah you have a lot of really healthy stuff that i've just even learned in this short period of time and. And we can build more we can find more things right, and sometimes when you've experienced just this level of trauma sometimes people just need a safe place to talk about it. And just express it like you said right like somebody who's paid to listen to you and not your friends. I was. I was watching this Ted talk, the other day, do you like Ted talks ever listened to them."
15794.0,Patient,I do sometimes.
416.0,Provider,"i'm going to share this one with you, you might actually I might play it in group so. Like it twice, because I love this one. hold on, let me I can put it in the chat for you, if you want to listen to it first, but this is about how we tell the stories in our lives. call this there is actually a name, like a clinical name for this it's called narrative therapy. it's about how we tell our stories and how that impacts and the way we feel about our lives right the stories that we tell ourselves about the experiences that we have are so powerful and it's not like. it's not like there's always only one version of the story. You know, we have there's so many different ways to tell the exact same story and part of it depends on point of view and perspective and sort of the way we're filtering it through our heads. But with the way we tell our story, the final version of that matters so much because it really determines how we feel about things. Here, and how do we look back and interpret these life events that have happened. And this therapist refers to herself as an editor because she spends a lot of time helping people sort of Edit Their stories and healthier ways."
15794.0,Patient,That is a good.
416.0,Provider,Would you say.
15794.0,Patient,"that's a good way to like think about it, you."
416.0,Provider,"yeah yeah well, I was thinking about it when I was watching this because I have a patient who actually he's writer, and he refers to me as this thought editor. Like that so actually. So yeah I mean that that's a little bit of what I think we'll do together is really look at these stories look at these stories of your life and your experiences and figure out ways to. To think through them in the healthiest possible way to help you move past them. how's that sound. Okay, thank you. So. Much because I also noticed, so I know that you started out working with Nadia. And, have you been in therapy before Nada before us. Know Okay, so this is a new experience for. me awesome and what, what are the. We don't need to talk about what happened with not drop it, what are the important traits like what are the things that are important to you to have a therapist."
15794.0,Patient,"Have a conversation with me like a human being and not like your robot. But what I mean because i'm a social work major I know how this goes. This goes and i'm just like it's like i'm having a bad day so you're having a bad day, yes I just said i'm having a bad day like. You know i'm just it's. yeah so that's. Okay yeah. But I that's why I really like you're ready, even with groups and stuff it's like very. interactive you know. yeah and i'm not just talking to myself."
416.0,Provider,Major here too.
15794.0,Patient,"i'm like oh my God, I know how this goes like i'm not a social worker, but like you know."
416.0,Provider,You got your bachelor's degree in social work. What are you planning to do with it.
15794.0,Patient,"um I don't know, but my last semester, I did my internship at. it's kind of it's CPS basically and I wasn't McCann unit child abuse and neglect said I didn't want to do and i'm traumatized i'm still traumatized like I was literally it was so bad that cullman Alabama like i've seen kids chained to bids and. Like it's so much, I saw. And I was the person taking the kids from the parents and it was just a lot, I was 21 I was like."
416.0,Provider,Oh yeah.
15794.0,Patient,"And then they're like so yeah when all for you i'm like. No, I can not not so you can know position, especially doing this right knows it was too much for me."
416.0,Provider,"good for you for saying now. My my shopify this my career before this. Was CPS and I was actually the director, or one of the directors in San Francisco. Before and then, then I I was finally like this, so toxic."
15794.0,Patient,It looks like.
416.0,Provider,"I was in there for like 20 something years and. Finally, I was like I. I will not do this in my life anymore i'm going to stop I took a year off and then I just like you know what I wanted to, I want to work with people, one on one again and then groups like I want to do this work, because this is like this is the best."

416.0,Provider,it's yeah.
15794.0,Patient,"really get paid, but I don't think anybody could ever get paid enough to deal with all that."
416.0,Provider,"Well, and the system is really broken the system is so broken and there's not an the fix for the system is so complex. And then to the people who are there working the front lines, the way that you were you just absorb all of that trauma yeah it's really it's it's literally like drinking a little bit of poison every day. Right now. So again, good for you, for standing up for yourself and being like this is not for me."
15794.0,Patient,But when I told. Mary that she like she did she got interrupted me she's like i'm going to refer you to Julie so. I was like okay great like.
416.0,Provider,"that's great. Okay, so we're already scheduled for our next session, which is perfect and in our next session will start. Wherever you want to start right so we've kind of talked about some goals and. I can follow your lead and start wherever or I can come and I will come prepared with some kind of specific skills around anxiety and depression that we can start working on. And so, a lot of what will also happen is that you know I do a lot of skill building in group as easy. And, and then we can kind of revisit some of that in individual to and just be like Okay, how is this working for you how did you try these skills didn't help at all what was your experience right, we can kind of make do a mixture of a lot of that."

15794.0,Patient,You too bye.
416.0,Provider,"All right, so can we please include the goals that are outlined in here into the goals section in in the narrative not in the narrative but in the goal section. So, specifically, I think we talked about building skills to manage anxiety and depression and we talked about processing through trauma and doing some narrative therapy to, especially with regard to the trauma but narrative therapy sort of editing her story to be able to. kind of come through difficult things in the healthiest possible way, and then I think we can expand on some of the skills, she already has, including. Her sort of communication and her inner personal relationships stuff is sounds really healthy and strong, so we can kind of leverage that to. To help her get through this as well. And I think that's about it, thank you."
