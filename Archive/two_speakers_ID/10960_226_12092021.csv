Just needs a little bit of extra tlc. You know reminders to drink water and."

10960.0,Patient,"And I think she downplayed she told me she wrenched her back we're really we think she like fell and she doesn't want to say anything because it's thanksgiving but. Something of that. had to have happened like. A little bit more than just. wrenching her back like she had to have fallen and forgot or something happened, and she did want to tell us because. Like her back was fine until thanksgiving you know, like she didn't complain allows that bladder infection was that bad. to wear like she was. That uncomfortable that probably did to it or added to it but."

10960.0,Patient,"yeah you know they're they're like pretty good, we had a really good. Company summer Barbecue to. They try. it's like I don't know, some people are like what are we doing it's coven but it's like if you're sick stay home because some people are like actually want to live life so it. picks. up and if you're not come party like I don't. know. I don't see why a pandemic, how to happen for everybody to realize that washing your hands is really important, and not drinking, just like normal shit you know, like. You have a fever don't bring your kid Oh, whatever."
226.0,Provider,"And hey so let's, we need to go over some treatment plan goals like short term and long term goals that you can focus on. Can you think of at least like two short term goals that you'd like to work on it can be clinically related or it can just be you know something that you've been thinking about wanting."
10960.0,Patient,"Is up my lamictal I went from 150 to 200 because I felt like I was having not like outbursts, but I feel like it was almost like my body was adjusting to it, and my moods were starting to like fluctuate. yeah so I feel like that's like something I need to work on, I feel like my body adjusted well to the little mcdo but. I feel like that's something that I need to pay attention to clinically and."
226.0,Provider,So um would you say paying attention to just your moods or that outbursts.
10960.0,Patient,"My moods and just like. I want to contain my emotions like I don't want him to be like so drastic for something like look so little like I just want to like. I don't know I feel like the two hundreds are really helping more than the 150. But I just feel like there I could be doing more like I could always like. be doing more, and I just want to keep like figuring that out."
226.0,Provider,"Okay, so how will you know that your mood is starting to shift and change or dip."
10960.0,Patient,"Well, how do I know if it's improving or how do I know when it's are either one."
226.0,Provider,"So how will you know if you start to if your mood starts to decline, like if it's if it starts to go down, how are you know."
10960.0,Patient,"So, every day, like at the end of the day, like I sit, and I think about like how I reacted to situations like verbally my reactions what I said what would have I could have like emphasized more. Like at the end of the day, i'm always doing like a daily Journal of how like, especially with my medications. Just like how i'm feeling or like situations that like not much triggered my diction but like triggered my mental health. Okay, I feel it. With the subs like I don't even think about using. Like it's crazy."
226.0,Provider,"yeah right. No okay so keep doing that, like keep you know it's kind of like a daily log a daily journal, just like okay. How did I do like that I have a dip did I have an outburst what was that caused from how can I not have, how can I improve on that you know just kind of maintaining that is a really, really good idea. yeah Okay, what about any another one can think of another short term goal."
10960.0,Patient,"For clinically. I want to try to bump down might circle. and try to. I want to try to dip slow down on my circle and see how my sleeping is because I just feel like the long terms of circle what i've been looking up is like it can be pretty like the side effects of being on that for a long time can be heavy so I want to try to like. Try to see if I can sleep, on my own, but then it's hard, because my lamictal literally has me like focused and everything and then I won't be able to go to sleep without my circle and I don't want to necessarily be dependent on that. bench."
226.0,Provider,"So. let's talk about some relaxation techniques, you can do, what do you do for relaxation."
10960.0,Patient,"i'll meditate i'll drink drink like a cup of tea at the end of the night, like some camera mail or something. Lots of meditation lots of mindfulness."
226.0,Provider,"Okay, so you're going to really want to stay consistent with that meditation okay you're going to really want to stay consistent with any kind of like deep breathing that you can do. And I mean like deep breathing where it goes to the abdominal man like you're really filling your body up with. oxygen breathing techniques every day will help so many areas of your life, and if you just do it once a day, you will start to notice a difference so it's really about, you know you inhale through your nose and you hold it for five counts and then you exhale through your mouth. and want to do that at least 10 times."
10960.0,Patient,In one session you're saying. Oh good.
226.0,Provider,"So incorporate the breathing. With the meditation as well do that okay. Okay okay great Okay, what about some long term goals."
10960.0,Patient,"clinically. Well, hopefully, I don't know if this will ever be possible, but hopefully I will have to be on medication forever. Like i've accepted the fact that I might have to just because of who what I am and. How sidetracked and scatterbrained I could be, but I would like to be able to learn to just. I don't know do it, but I don't even know if my brain can do that. right since i've been on medication i've never been off, so I don't even know what you know. And like Sometimes I feel like a robot i'm like damn I gotta take medicine in the morning to focus at work, then I gotta take medicine to fall asleep, because then I don't like it's. Sometimes I feel like i'm not a robot and a schedule yeah I don't really like I feel like really good but I when I think about it, I wish I could feel good without being heavily medicated."
226.0,Provider,"So maybe right now it's not really thinking about that and just not like like really just thinking about Okay, the benefits of what the medication to give you, and because you're doing really well. So you know, giving it some time Okay, you know yeah let's have that in the back of your mind possibly some point, not having to take meds or maybe not having to take as many meds Okay, you know that can be kind of an ongoing long term goal but it's going to have to be. Really."
10960.0,Patient,slow. yeah like tapered off.
226.0,Provider,yeah yeah. yeah.
10960.0,Patient,"And I like okay like I like that idea of tapering because, instead of like well, obviously I know it's like completely unhealthy to just hope, like cold Turkey cut it off, but. If I tapers in like if I noticed things I could stop the tape or you know, rather than like cold Turkey, I feel like your brains gonna go haywire."
226.0,Provider,yeah you don't ever want to just go cold Turkey so anytime you're going to taper off any of the kind of medications that you're on you're going to want to do it with that doctor.
10960.0,Patient,Okay yeah.
226.0,Provider,"Obviously, like checking in so um you know with the short term goals, those are just kind of like an media right now kind of ongoing you know. You know, like just kind of checking in with yourself just to see how how things are constantly going, which is great. So we'll just kind of leave that as like open ended, like all of the goals of just to kind of open ended in that you're just constantly working on them so it's you know it's these the goals that you have to are also like really great company mechanisms. You know yeah i'm the meditation Oh, the one thing I do want you just to try and include is the breathing."
10960.0,Patient,yeah sometimes i'll do that if I can't pass out i'll just like count my breathing. Free breath and I literally fall asleep.
226.0,Provider,"that's right. Just following the breath because that's very meditative and very relaxing. Okay, all right good good goals okay um anything else that you wanted to go over."
10960.0,Patient,I don't think so.
226.0,Provider,"Okay, are you in town for the holidays are you going to be going anywhere."
10960.0,Patient,i'm for Christmas i'll go down for Christmas Day and then i'm coming back up.
226.0,Provider,"Okay, so we have another appointment on the 23rd. yeah. OK cool. OK OK good."
10960.0,Patient,"On your end does this show if they sent out a urine peek up for me, or does it not show I gotta ask the virtual planet."
226.0,Provider,"yeah you're gonna want to ask the virtual clinic and here's the deal, some of those cups are not making it to the clients, for whatever reason. yeah hey it's been an ongoing issue so that's also why I want you checking in with the virtual clinic that's a question, they can answer you want to make sure they have your correct address you want to make sure you let them know that you have not received it. Okay, because it's on bright hearts and not. Your end, not the other clients and. So I want to make sure that they that that's at least noted so it's in the system so you're not just blowing it off."
10960.0,Patient,"Right yeah so one time they gave me a lab order, and I just want to. Look at what."
226.0,Provider,"And that's what some people have been doing. yeah because it's been an issue where they've been saying I you know, like it's been. The cups been out sent out two or three times and they're still not getting it so it's like just go to the lab."
10960.0,Patient,it's easier.
226.0,Provider,"yeah totally. Okay, all right, well then i'll talk to you in a couple of weeks. Okay. bye."
