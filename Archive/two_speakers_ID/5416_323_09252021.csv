Mostly for a few hours, and I will get to know her name but it's. super booster. blistered and like real tight feeling like it's real swollen so. You know i'm a hot mess, always a hot mess phyllis always just slow down and that's why I tried to katie me she wants to do 10 things at once, my you have to slow down. And I am taking my own advice and all."
323.0,Provider,The thing you have to start to be the role model for that now.
5416.0,Patient,"I do, I really do like I have to just stop pause a minute, because I, my cousin. I want to do it, like my head is like I don't know if I need to get my medicine adjusted, maybe, or like my anxiety medication, because I just kind of been a little off lately. So I don't know, maybe, maybe that's why I need to talk to my primary care and see what she says, I want her to check out my throat anyways and she has a 19 my. My thoughts one almost died races recipe like it used to like it before, and then I teach yoga on stuff, so I will leave that unchecked out before I end up in the hospital."
323.0,Provider,yeah you need to get there.
5416.0,Patient,"yeah so. definitely do that maybe talking about getting my anxiety me just you know mix it up a little bit I medication and i've been on it for three years, maybe we gonna."
323.0,Provider,I was gonna say you might just be up for some kind of dosage.
5416.0,Patient,"yeah I want to do something, because I. Is not even bad anxiety Mike and just tell like I don't know, like my body clinches up like I get more like i'm more nervous and. I think I you know I obviously always got so much going on, but you know the kids and my kids and everything so going to do something I almost called yesterday and I forgot to make it a plan for my son and my doctor I always forget everything."
323.0,Provider,You do what you have to do for the kids you forget.
5416.0,Patient,"Oh well, yeah I had to write big green thing of there is my two appointments will deal with you and Dr so, because if not, I will forget if it is not right there."
323.0,Provider,Good that you're getting a little bit of an organizational structure going.
5416.0,Patient,"Well, I mean a piece of paper to organize."
323.0,Provider,It somewhere you look every day so it's going to. remind you.
5416.0,Patient,"Absolutely, because my phone, for some reason, it does not my old phone, use like tell me this phone is not say nothing you don't say nothing. care. Okay, once you got to do it, it sets up like it pops up on the home screen, but it does it tell you, so I always dismiss everything. Right, we got 10 gmail accounts attached to it. So now it's like okay now."
323.0,Provider,How are you sleeping these days.
5416.0,Patient,"i'm actually i'm not I got I sleep, but I fall asleep I go to the bathroom i'll see what I got I got i'll see them I sleep setting up all the time, like i'm not resting at all. I wasn't using my see Patmos you neither so because, when I can't hear the kids the little kids on when I have that going. yeah so I use that two nights ago and slept like a baby. Okay, I cleaned the House and I think it looks too much water in it, because I started coughing up some stuff but that's besides the point. So, but yeah I figured I might have to make a little kids sleep on my floor so I can sleep. well."
323.0,Provider,"So then there's two key things one is I want you to get try to get back into some kind of sleep schedule. yeah that obviously has impact, but also getting into the doctor to talk about medication adjustments and look at your throat."
5416.0,Patient,"Yes, me."
323.0,Provider,And you know the anti anxiety for sure what we might need to look at something for the hyperactivity to I. don't really want to lose all the energy and I don't think it'll take it all away but.
5416.0,Patient,But the thing is I don't even have a lot of energy i'm just always.
323.0,Provider,"it's the distraction. yeah is really wearing you out, and I would talk with her about that as well. I mean that's the preferences to get it through your primary care she's already managing. But up for you to mention that, to a doctor, so when you see her to that you and I spoke about it and that's how you're taking care of it. Okay, see your primary care to kind of cover that kind of stuff."
5416.0,Patient,Okay yeah definitely because I think if I just focus a little bit I probably got a lot more done. So i'm.
323.0,Provider,So exhausted.
5416.0,Patient,"yeah yeah I know, like you, can't take Adam I say no, but they gotta have other stuff out there that's."
323.0,Provider,"Right. yeah there is some other stuff out there um. But there was something else I was just gonna ask you. about the distraction. Oh no, no, it was about your doctor, so what is going on, like it can you get in person visits now with the doctor and stuff."
5416.0,Patient,I could. Change.
323.0,Provider,Looking at your throat.
5416.0,Patient,"Yes or want to see me okay. I need to get my son told me my time zone was two times, am I supposed to be. Like two years ago, but then it gets better and then I don't know if it swells up I don't know what it does and doesn't bother me for a while now, but I don't want to get to the point that i'm picking up everything can't drink and end up."
323.0,Provider,You know and that's not lose weight.
5416.0,Patient,"yeah yeah especially. that's why I started there's a way to last night because I couldn't eat. my throat close the point three millimeter like he went he did a cat scan or whatever he did, and then he's I mean he's that I have to innovate you like literally that was it. Like I had no time and talent take my dentures out until my Daddy and that was my best funnels are they died, but."
323.0,Provider,yeah. Wait you just went on mute I lost your sound. Can you hear me I can't hear you. know.
