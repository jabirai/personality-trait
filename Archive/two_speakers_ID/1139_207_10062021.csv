207.0,Provider,"You sounds like I needed to confirm that you to attending your session, earlier we we only got 30 minutes to catch up on. What up."
1139.0,Patient,"Life, you know the normal. vs of being at home with kids was idea mind constantly. But you know it's just while that."
207.0,Provider,In a minute.
1139.0,Patient,"You know, I was just thinking about earlier, how long it's been it's been a while. Oh no not really much going on being."
207.0,Provider,"The last time I think I met with you, you were going to someone."
1139.0,Patient,Somewhere oh yeah we are we went to Columbus yeah oh wow yeah it's gonna happen anytime for sure. I mean I don't know things have been things barrel still drinks and whatever.
207.0,Provider,And the last time I spoke with ups come up.
1139.0,Patient,"Oh yeah How long does that last, for you know much bullshit comes out of that man's mouth, and so I just said the other day it's like God, if I was as sensitive as you are two things we'd be real like we have a real problem, because that sensitivity went out the window a long time ago. On I don't know I mean things are the way they are. I spend a lot of my time either in the House or at a damn doctor's appointment of some CERT therapy. Maybe appointments something."
207.0,Provider,You said therapies oh you're doing you.
1139.0,Patient,"know he doing physical therapy. Occupational therapy hopefully soon they put in a request to get him cranial helmet for reshaping. So hopefully soon we'll start with that process, and we can get us helmet and start reshaping his head. Because he has really bad toward a palace, and he prefers one side or the other, and because of that his head is like flat, on the one side and there's he can completely turn his neck, the other way, if he wants to if he wants to, I have another one of those. But you know I don't know it's just it's been in streaming doing always forever been in the House and I tried to get out a little bit here and there, but. I never seem to make much of a difference because you still just remember being in the House all the time. it's just been hard with these girls, you know we've had terrible twos, without a doubt. And they it just drains life on you know between that and then the older kids and then my mom just had coded so I hadn't you know, and that not having the you know the help she gives me."
207.0,Provider,And I didn't get hospitalized michie.
1139.0,Patient,"know by the grace of God only because she has she has oxygen at home and she didn't have oxygen at home and she would have been in the hospital for sure, even now, her oxygen level was reading at three earlier so it's still not very well um. But. yeah like my sister and my dad and my nephew God and I didn't we didn't know if we should have gotten my mind out of the House or not, and right before they got out of quarantine my mom was tested positive. I was really sick for a little bit, and then we had like a week of everybody feel like being better and then boom, we were sick again. Like it's been like a really one hell of a week because I was like sick as a damn dog and then the the end James was really, really sick to. arm if I wouldn't have been able to break this temperature I would have had to take him to the hospital, but I was able to do it over a couple days but. He has like a like a shitty cough now like it's kind of dry it's not very nice to see so. All no I didn't want to have to take them in because of how sick, you know the hospitals are like how. Like they really don't want you to have to bring a baby in unless you have to like direly have to now because of everybody, you know people having co good being in the hospital in emergency rooms and so on and so forth it's just exposing him more. than what he needs to be two things so. We I know we held that out when it's just than what it is, I mean there's no point in the bs we're here on this is probably the longest streak we've had in a while. And it's like beating a dead horse, you know I mean like why consignors I I just do what I do, I mean after so long people kind of get the hint either you need to help me or leave me alone um. I don't know my inside so really, really bad."
207.0,Provider,You seem very desensitized from everything.
1139.0,Patient,"you're just kind I mean I. I have to make myself that way anymore, because, why not like why. There is no point but it's the same things that happen over and over again and it's like. ideal window and it happens i'm a bitch for a couple of days, and then I go back to doing what I have to do. It because if not, then, like my anxiety is always on a million in my enterprise and i'm always the Christ like, then I physically can't even take care of my kids because it's like I can't do it. So I have to i've had to get myself back to be desensitized over the past couple weeks because i'm just so tired of like always feeling like my my inside body is going a million miles. In it, but my outside body is trying to catch up, I don't know if that makes sense."
207.0,Provider,But that's what it feels like.
1139.0,Patient,"mm hmm so I mean I do the best I can, if that's not good enough for people to. help me. What i've been screaming for how many years well. You know. What are your friends."
207.0,Provider,"You are frozen, I can you hear me."
1139.0,Patient,Are you there.
207.0,Provider,"can hear me. Okay. Can you hear me. Okay, can you hear me now."
1139.0,Patient,yeah yeah I can hear you. I can hear you now.
207.0,Provider,"Okay, because you're when you were frozen for a minute, and then I heard you say, can you hear me."
1139.0,Patient,"Oh you're frozen, I was talking and then I realized. I had I stopped off camera i'm getting dressed um I you were frozen, I was talking and then i'm like why she's frozen and then I think that's when you could still hear me boat, then it bounced out I don't know i'm. Sorry. So I don't know what you heard last of other than. I don't even remember what I said I said I."
207.0,Provider,"know you were just talking about your. You said you said, which is something you said sometime ago when you were actually working. On trying to. get a place of your own and you were working with the trial protective services and you were working with the case manager. And they were trying to find you a place for you and the kids and you had said the same me it's everybody's pulling in my life, and no one has helped me i'm crying out for help and, basically, is what you just said just now."
1139.0,Patient,"And yeah but. it's like I desensitize myself because, why not like like i'm tired of my self inside feeling going on, like, I feel like i'm going a million miles a minute, but it feels like my body's trying to catch up like it might not make sense, but it makes sense because that's."
207.0,Provider,"how you feel you're having an out of body experience here. And this. Is the situation with you're taking care of everyone, what is that, how is Xavier and the other and the girls."
1139.0,Patient,"And they're fine I mean exhibitors and school haven't had any problems, yet. The twins hug Jesus, they are a headache and a half, but you know how else would my life habit there at that stage there too they're crazy they're wild it's always non stop."
207.0,Provider,"But do the older kids help you, with your."
1139.0,Patient,"I mean that's what I always say unless there's something involved for somebody I get no help like as a child, I didn't get paid to play with my sister, I was told to sit down and play with now like that's what you're about to you know, so I. Everybody knows what i'm fed up and i've had enough because i'm going to strengthen it. You know, and then it's like then everything people will help autumns usually the only one that's good for helping."
207.0,Provider,out very late.
1139.0,Patient,"Oh, I mean he works, he works and then like Friday I was sick as sick as a dog and you're going to drink and then you're going to go out and then i'm going to be up at five o'clock in the morning, dealing with a drunk. When I got to be up at seven o'clock with babies and then give me two hours to myself to go. This is y. ou. des monster. looks like."
207.0,Provider,Oh wow. that's a lot of cleaning we.
1139.0,Patient,Look at that monster.
207.0,Provider,That is a lot of cleaning. up with but. yeah you have a confined to one area.
1139.0,Patient,"yeah well it's gonna be a lot of team for somebody today not me. One of those kids can do it, I mean they'll help once once I Tom that it's time to clean up and they need to help no help clean."
207.0,Provider,So. Right now. you're pretty much just kind of on the go with everything between taking the taking what is this a little bit the baby's name again your. Yang. you're muted.
1139.0,Patient,I wasn't sure.
207.0,Provider,So your mom helps you when he can. But outside of that you're pretty much. As it's always been somewhat of a single mom in a relationship building.
1139.0,Patient,"yeah yeah so somebody posted something about being being with a hard working man that's why women either view or boys, because they can't put up with a lot of hours and the fact that you're not always. on and so forth, I just kind of laughed because that's how like a little girl but it's hard being with a hard working man and when. They just feel like they work, a job, but the job that they created a family isn't important to them, so I feel like I said the other day I was like this isn't 1950s. wrong with. This I said I said this isn't 1950 like you don't just go to work and come home in your food service for you and your bath barters ran and then. You go sit on the couch in your kids don't bother with you, like most men work a job and then come home and help take care of their kids because that's what you do you know what I mean like you don't have kids and then just expected to take care of them, but that always. No, no phones no. that'll always be like his thing like he just thinks he can great kids and that's that you know who cares i'll deal with them when I was on the weekends, or whatever, and then it's up to the woman to take care of it all. Okay guys night night I bring a snack snack. scream bloody murder. Sorry. Let me see nope nope."
207.0,Provider,You have to take all three of them.
1139.0,Patient,"No, no, the baby today."
207.0,Provider,"Well, you."
1139.0,Patient,"know, I have to take the beats that there's the girls will be here."
207.0,Provider,"Also, your mom is on her way over."
1139.0,Patient,"yeah so be over probably shortly. So yeah like that's my outing for the for the week is hit the grocery store maybe today and take the baby to therapy. I mean that's just that's like you know supposed to it's my fun time or I mean. What Monday or something I left for an hour to go to polls, they get like a couple of years of clothes or. This is funny I was leaving Saturday, right after he stayed up and drink and whatever and somebody like Where are you going i'm like i'm going to get my nails done they're like. They said something and I was like moment, the last time I left the House when was the last time I got my nails done because that was the last time I left the House here like two weeks ago and I said there you go. Three hours to myself in two weeks. And and and i'm i'm supposed to feel bad because i'm leaving like. that's you know that's just the way that because i'm always here, so what I do, I mean I don't whatever. Whatever anymore it's just hard to most days is whatever and I wish I could get myself out of that much faster like thinking that way, but I don't know if."
207.0,Provider,"you wish, you can get yourself."
1139.0,Patient,"Out of that Funk like where i'm just because I know, like, I think I still have depression problems from having a baby and going through all of that."
207.0,Provider,mm hmm.
1139.0,Patient,"But then the whole situation even most people that people that don't even live a life like this, who knows you know what I mean look from the outside you're like Should I be a little depressed to being in the House all time think your kids."
207.0,Provider,But I think it's the anxiety it's. it's I think well since we've been working together for about a year and a.
1139.0,Patient,girl we rise so saving a lot of the girls will be to in November.
207.0,Provider,"So yeah it's been it's been about two years, because I think when. I started working with you and just found that you were pregnant with them."
1139.0,Patient,yeah I think so too.
207.0,Provider,"yeah and so. It may be. postpartum related. I would add that in there and your continuous Depression and anxiety. which have my my concern has always been in in, and I know. Especially now. With your medication i'm even said it's kind of odd because you never usually miss your appointment and you've been missing it."
1139.0,Patient,"yeah but I mean it's not, I think a lot of that has added to the sickness that's been around because. I think I missed twice what Dr style and that was you know. One of the weeks I had there was like three doctors appointments like Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and then. with you, I was it was sick I was sick and it was like we were sick for a week and then for a week we got better and then the next week, we were sick again so it was like. And it'd be fun and it sucks if they're just sick that's one thing that's Okay, but when I get sick and I usually don't get sick. It really like puts a damper on everything, because I mean I do a lot I do a lot of stuff you know I mean on top of. Being sick all week having to take care of kids like get up with them in the morning, so when they go to bed like with no break whatsoever, because I couldn't I didn't have any help and then. it's just really like the that's even like waving me down even more, and then on top of just the normal you know what I mean."
207.0,Provider,"mm hmm. But, but again you're a depression, of course, has been there from a long time. And we've talked about we work through a lot of the stuff tonight and a lot of that outside of your your past and your history, a lot of that comes from, of course, your relationships with your depression. It is situational a circumstantial is all of that. With the birth of the babies back to back the anxiety of course i'm sure your anxieties is out the door. and And I know we've talked about this. If you were able to. Have a change of scenery. I don't I wouldn't say that your depression or anxiety would go away. yeah but. From what i've we've talked about, I think it would come down significantly."
1139.0,Patient,"yeah because I think about that too, if it was just like me, then I think about how hard that would be just on its own, as well, like having to work a nine to five and then come home and do all this. well."
207.0,Provider,"You know what would that be, it would be a stressor right. To be a car mom to having to do that. But think about the added piece of your current life situation."
1139.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
207.0,Provider,"If we talk ourselves out of things that we talk ourselves out of our true our truth is it's one thing for me to get up and go to work or leave it nobody want to get up to go to work every day, especially in light of Kobe I mean who likes to do that, not more. You know, having children and having to deal with them, I have to do that for about a week and a half, on myself, and I was like oh my God bless them to see that. And so, and my children are not as young as yours. that's the added stress or within itself, which you know that you have to have to be done. yeah as women. I know what I have to do, I just need to condition my mind to do it, it doesn't come it doesn't it's, not to say that i'm not going to be overwhelmed and i'm not going to be stressful along the way. So everything that you're saying when you think about going to work and figuring out what you're going to be with the kids and all of that, but with you, like you said you're out of body experience to be sensitive to from. From just kind of everyone around you the situation around you. ELISE I think a lot of that comes from the relationship you're in yeah."
1139.0,Patient,"Like I think about like I went way too many years wasn't getting my feelings hurt. Like getting my feelings are tough. And I allowed some I do that. Like for what. i'll be back right right right, where I was anyways."
207.0,Provider,"And what. And so what puts you back in, and this is a truth, this is our truth so like you know, like, I was writing something up and I said, we have to tap into our real intrinsic truth. We have to be honest about what our true is because, once we have identified our truth and we say our truth, then we'll know how to seek the assistance and for everyone who wants to offer assistance. they'll know if you're unable to help me in this manner, then I mean what are we having a conversation for and you're infringing truth is ELISE the relationship that you're in you're in it, because you seen no other way to financially support yourself."
1139.0,Patient,yep yep yep.
207.0,Provider,"So you think about your anxiety and your depression now, my question is in this was going on earlier, I think I want to say earlier this year yeah earlier this year, when you I try to work on with working with a socialist or anything, did you ever apply for housing. about it."
1139.0,Patient,When you're.
207.0,Provider,A girl.
1139.0,Patient,"yeah they um they did something like once Kobe has that they put an open lottery, but that just gave even more like opportunity for people to apply, you know what I mean. On so I put my information and they told me to like put in as like this place to homeless, so I put both you know that I hadn't kids this that whatever I still haven't heard in the response back from anybody."
207.0,Provider,"But you did a pot, you did put through all of those different things, and I know your biggest fear was."
1139.0,Patient,being placed in.
207.0,Provider,"A neighborhood that you work so hard to get out of it not bringing in Xavier back into this negative toxic environment meaning living, not so much where you are now but based on where they place you. yeah housing."
1139.0,Patient,"um but I learned in cuyahoga county if you're paying for the lottery. A lot of it will be like where your residence was or like you're like ID address kind of deal, so I think I and anybody that would accept it because they have like. section eight were like houses like landlords like have their houses. And then you know they they let me know about like PRC and things like that, like they help you get furniture need to up to a certain amount or bad or something like that or. Like would help you with first month's bread and the positive news show proof that you're like you're able to. then go ahead and continue, you know I need to make payments and so on and so forth, like they just not gonna tell you money and be like here. So I don't know I applied for, like the hud housing, which is like. Sam ha or section eight but still haven't heard a response back from anybody like I said it's a lottery for them so they random and just However it works it's randomly picked. I tried to apply for Armas housing it's another like city in the area, but there's it's closed for like the next five years and they're not even. They don't even have anything open, so I don't know I mean i'm i'm still on the list i'm sorry Oh, and you know, on the waiting list i'm as far as I know my case would be CFS should be closed now. They stuck around for some time on some bs. And then I finally finally learn to how the system works, a little bit more now so Now I know if I ever anybody ever calls me again. I know I have the right to tell them no i'm not participating in anything and no I don't want nothing to do with you guys. They seem if they deem it fit, you know that if it was that bad of a situation or something, then they get a court order but i'm allowed to tell them no. which I never knew before I was wondering how Harold skated underneath the radar and never was bothered by anybody just because it tells them no. yeah so. But I mean that's like that was a stressor because they're wanting me to go drop every week and i'm like you guys i'm joking me right, like. i'm not going every week and dropping for you guys I don't know what you're trying to find but you're not going to find it first of all, you guys are doing nothing but stressing me out. All because of some marijuana and somebody system. i'm. How do you expect me to go and drop with eight with seven kids but I can't leave them at home and I don't have anybody. That was under their business that my mom was coming over at least I didn't see that you don't I mean because I don't want to get her involved in it, and they would have gotten her involved in F dot this isn't any of her fault nor her problem you know what I mean. So, as far as they knew I was here by myself with kids all day like how am I supposed to go drop, but I can't leave my kids at home, because then they'd be unfit you know. So I did the best I could with them and I finally told them like you guys need to tell your like show whatever. Whatever information i've given you to your your supervisor when you guys had to sit down meeting you guys need to let them know like she wants her case closed it's been over six months, you guys didn't even need to be in it that long you know, like."
207.0,Provider,"let's. let's make that happen you're muted in. camera. If you can hear me. Can you hear me. Yes, okay. Listen let's jump in you have your youth you go back to group weekly right."
1139.0,Patient,"hey i've been going weekly, I think we talked about I don't know if we're supposed to move me Max bi weekly or weekly I just go anyways. But I was supposed to be my prescription yeah Australia, because I hadn't seen you they were going to bridge it that's."
207.0,Provider,"Why, he did it. He did it. He did I sent a message me such. Interesting so let's do what days are good for you only. I mean, I know he's really good, but what they have good. What day, and time is good."
1139.0,Patient,I mean Friday is you're still fine early when the work you know 910 o'clock the babies are probably always going to be floating around but.
207.0,Provider,You know what let's do let's do the 22nd.
1139.0,Patient,Okay.
207.0,Provider,"All right, then I do so."
1139.0,Patient,"Okay, thank you."
207.0,Provider,No problem.
