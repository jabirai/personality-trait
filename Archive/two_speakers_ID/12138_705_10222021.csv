12138.0,Patient,hi Valerie.
705.0,Provider,hi how are you.
12138.0,Patient,"i'm Okay, how are you doing."
705.0,Provider,"i'm doing really well I apologize that I had been in one session, and then it goes, you probably heard with the recording and then you have to tap that you're Okay, with the recording. yeah and then we go through a process i'm like okay process. But i'm glad that you're able to sit to sign on and yeah so how is your Friday."
12138.0,Patient,"um it's Okay, I mean i'm. I haven't really had much plan, I mean, I just have to do a bunch of housework like laundry and things. mm hmm."
705.0,Provider,"So today is more organized organizing and things like that. yeah Okay, since last time we met what are some things that have come to mind or come up for you."
12138.0,Patient,Hello.
705.0,Provider,Can you still hear me tiffany.
12138.0,Patient,yeah yeah. I don't know why the APP shut down for.
705.0,Provider,"I know all of a sudden, I didn't see any more you disappeared for a moment, were you able to hear me with i'm just asking like since we met the last time, like what's come up for you and different things that that you're working on."
12138.0,Patient,"um yeah so recently I wouldn't say recently for a while now, I think um i've become pretty depressed so it's been pretty hard for me to. Basically, just get things done i'm even get out of bed sometimes. I think. I feel literally I feel like the days are going by and like i'm just in the same position, or like i'm moving slower than everyone else."
705.0,Provider,"Have you been able to tiffany to share with Mary excuse me to share with Mary of what's going on, where you're having trouble getting out of the bed and feeling, you know, like you said, more and more depressed."
12138.0,Patient,"yeah I have she switched up my meds um but she said, if this is a work she's gonna probably add in like a mood stabilizers on things so i've yet to talk to her. um I probably talked to her. In crew. On Tuesday. Because my next appointment isn't until November."
705.0,Provider,"Okay, that would be a good time then. To see you know, to have that discussion so i'm glad you're already ahead of the game letting her know that this is what's going on you'd have the communicating there and now just seeing where okay. yeah because I see the follow up is on the first of November. And our group is the 26 which, which would be the the 12 o'clock. yeah it's you know too so that's one avenue and it's just like yes so getting those things under way and then until you're able to switch the medication is trying to seek. To tiffany as. Justice each day trying to see what you can do like you fit in groups before where some people are putting a plan, where they have to go water, the plan, if you get out of bed it's like. Okay. You know this is a win for me."
12138.0,Patient,"yeah definitely. yeah my main goal. For every day now is just to try to get out of bed at a consistent time that's like still the morning, rather than like afternoon or."
705.0,Provider,"Exactly and to be able to also feel good about that, where it's just like look I know i'm going through a difficult time my body, you know right now. It is more, you know, for me, depression is here, and so i'm going to do my best and i'm not going to go inward and judge myself it's just like. i'm going to do my best, and if I get out of bed great if I need some more time and that maybe each day isn't going to be the way you wanted it where it was a certain time but you're building on that. That yeah. that's progress."
12138.0,Patient,yeah it's just hard like it's hard for me to. Like change my entire I guess routine to just being like one little goal like that. Because I have so much other things that. I have to basically take care of like obviously I can't.
705.0,Provider,And feeling overwhelmed of when you don't get that done and you already put the expectation than your standard is like way up here.
12138.0,Patient,yeah exactly I just feel like like i'm letting myself and other people down like every day because. Like I guess my goal that people around me like my family and they don't understand that my goal is like just to get up every day is a thing like i'm either lazy or. Things and they think i'm selfish but it's not even like that I can barely like.
705.0,Provider,"yeah, and that is the lack of understanding that unless someone has a mental health disorder. That they they really don't quite get what that's like and that's why yeah important with group is when people hear you and they're like yes, I know it's like a big win if I get to go from my bed to the living room."
12138.0,Patient,yeah exactly.
705.0,Provider,"Right, it is tiffany and it's you know it's hard to when you're trying to deal with it yourself and then, when your family they love you. However, sometimes the worst that they try to use to motivate you because they have that lack of understanding. yeah is not helpful to call you lazy does not at all meet what's happening for you. yeah, nor is it healthy or helpful."
12138.0,Patient,yeah it's Definitely not.
705.0,Provider,"And having you know some family members may be a little bit more open to listening, of how it is for you to navigate through life and having a mental health disorder. and others are just have their own interpretation of what it is and they might not have that response that you would like. How is it with your immediate family."
12138.0,Patient,"Well, my mom works all day and my dad basically works at like very weird hours of days, so when he comes he's always asleep so. we're not very close. I think everyone. individually just does their own thing i'm the closest person i'm closest to in my family's my sister my younger sister but i'm even me and her going through something um I think. it's really weird, though, because she she has anxiety and depression, too, but she still doesn't treat it when it comes to me like she understands what i'm going through either."
705.0,Provider,"mm hmm. And you know, is it possible to because even though your sister has it also she could have a different degree of it."
12138.0,Patient,Definitely definitely she definitely handles it differently she's more. she's more. Like angry and resentful. Rather than me how i'm just like. Basically apathetic and. Just now willing to do anything.
705.0,Provider,"yeah and that's really difficult when it's your own sister where you're like come on now, this is, you know, but having that understanding, you have that understanding that yeah it's at different levels and things like that too."
12138.0,Patient,"I think it's also because i'm. Like when I started feeling this way um, I guess, I felt like I didn't have control over my life and. I think i've gone into really bad habit of like just spending money that I don't have. So i've been like. Very impulsive because I think that's, the only way I can actually have an outlet to do something that makes me happy I guess buying things makes me happy i'm not even sure. But. I think it's been pretty bad and I think I. reached out to my sister about it, and you know she she helped me with some of my bills, which i'm not proud of because she's my younger sister. So I think my sister's been pretty resentful because I guess I can't get a handle on that issue."
705.0,Provider,you're recognizing that that's become problematic.
12138.0,Patient,yeah it's a big step yeah.
705.0,Provider,"And you're right, it was giving you relief, it was giving you that reward you order something you're excited it you're thinking about it right. yeah all that isn't rewarding yourself it releases dopa me. yeah yeah when it becomes problematic is it's like okay Now I know okay this this was getting relief, but now I have stress, because the bill is coming in. Exactly yeah and having it as a learning lesson, where I learned okay now financial stability financial responsibility is something I need to work on. And again, you know just for today i'm going to do my best so probably wouldn't pay off all the bills, right now, but your sister she paid off some of them. And then seeing okay How else can you start to have some of those things, and it takes time to discover it some of those things that are going to bring you some joy or are going to bring you that reward that you get from shopping."
12138.0,Patient,"Honestly, I don't even know because I every day I don't I always think in my head like today, I think I should go walk the dogs or something, but like I never get around to it because I just can't can't get myself to do it. Okay, so I don't know I think it's gotten pretty unhealthy, because the only thing that really makes me happy is like. When I like. Smoke marijuana and like just have a meal like enjoy my meal and that's like the only thing that really makes me happy. And like carefree and. Stress free, which is. really bad that I have to lean on something like that, so I don't really know how to really deal. or like fine interests that make me happy. Other than something that's detrimental to me."
705.0,Provider,"yeah and part of it will be working with Mary to find the right medication that you don't feel as exhausted, where you have some energy. because energy is deplete it, you can have all the thoughts, as you know, but getting up and doing that, as another whole big step. So, knowing that there's some hope and keeping that like Okay, I know that i'm going to get this it's going to take time, being able to you know with the food well the food is a reward and the food can be you know, a release of below me."
12138.0,Patient,yeah definitely.
705.0,Provider,"wow and so that's probably more of a healthy choice unless it becomes problematic where then sometimes people will bench and then maybe you know you purge and then you know. yeah happened. But if right now, if that satisfying and you know, like a chocolate is your thing and just thinking about it already makes you smile, or what is your favorite food."
12138.0,Patient,It depends on the day. it's something different.
705.0,Provider,"Okay, what is it today."
12138.0,Patient,"Oh, I think. i'm i'm thinking about my grandma's cooking."
705.0,Provider,"Okay, and what's your what's your favorite dish of your grandma's."
12138.0,Patient,She likes to cook a lot of Vietnamese food um so I eat a lot of Vietnamese food autumn at her house.
705.0,Provider,yeah okay and what's the main dish.
12138.0,Patient,She cooks a lot of fun. She always has fun her house.
705.0,Provider,"You said it already you were smiling, and I can. Get her eyes light up and you're like yeah like. Some other spa you know."
12138.0,Patient,Say yeah.
705.0,Provider,"yeah and so with the you know it's like Okay, so the food, you know, could be a source for you right now, just to to lift your mood and then with marijuana to it is where it can change your mood. With with marijuana, though, if we look at it. What is the risk, and if it if it's the healthiest with marijuana, especially with medications is sometimes it can interfere. yeah and so it's like yes you're getting that relief, but is it worth the risk. If you can do some of the other things like you were talking about with eating and even if. For right now, if you think of all these things that you could do like walking the dogs and stuff like that. As seeing it as this is the time that you're going to explore you don't have the energy to do these things, yet and to implement it, but this is just discovery and so, if a thought comes in, of what you want to do you could jot it down or just keep it, you know, in your mind. When you do have more you know energy that these are some of the things that you may do. yeah yeah and being able to just come from a place that until I can really get the energy and be able to do some of these things, how can I be kind to myself, how can I, you know be be my best friend is. For your friends would you say some of the things. That you know. That you're saying to yourself, would you say that to if a friend was telling you, you know about your situation."
12138.0,Patient,"yeah I mean, I think I am my toughest critic and i'm I just expected more from myself at this point in my life, so the fact that, like. i'm depressed and i'm not doing the things I need to do in order to facilitate. Like moving out or being in the healthier environment is it's just disappointing to me and I just feel like a failure, sometimes and it's hard for me, because in the back of my mind, obviously I still have to take this exam to get licensed as a pharmacist. And like I keep postponing the the test, but. I don't know it's just always in the back of my mind that I should be doing something I should be studying, so I don't know it doesn't really help I don't really know how to deal with that."
705.0,Provider,"yeah well i'm glad that you're being honest and talking about it, because those should is usually where the critic comes out and. The garrick. is part of what provokes the anxiety and that internal dialogue goes negative where you said, where I feel like i'm a failure. And so, part of what you can start to do tiffany starting to see like what is the evidence that you're a failure."
12138.0,Patient,"I just. I don't know I feel like I don't have my own play I don't have my own car anymore. I don't have my job anymore so it's literally i'm very dependent on my family right now, which i'm not used to."
705.0,Provider,"Cry so that's on that side now, if we look like you, we look into evidence against it what's the evidence against that you're a failure."
12138.0,Patient,That I went to a lot of school and I got a bachelor's degree a doctor degree. um. I don't know I I. i'm battling with depression and i'm still here I guess um that's basically all I can think about.
705.0,Provider,"yeah and when you really start to think and be open and honest with yourself that list is going to expand. Because, if you think you're a failure and you're looking at all the collecting evidence for it you're going to feel that belief. But if you start to think about it against it, like you said here you are with all those degrees degrees that doesn't sound like a failure. And so it's putting it where you're thinking about it different even where the evidence for you said because you're not living independence, I would also put it over in the category of evidence against it, you know how to live independently you've done it before. Yes, circumstances are right now that you're living in a different environment, but you know how So if you know how to do it does that belong in the failure category."
12138.0,Patient,No necessarily yeah.
705.0,Provider,"You know how to drive. yeah you have a driver's license. So, putting that too, and the evidence against that i'm a failure, when the circumstances changes I know how to drive already already have my driver's license."
12138.0,Patient,You know.
705.0,Provider,already completed that.
12138.0,Patient,"yeah I guess it is all circumstantial but it's just. Really different from from what i'm used to and it's like all at once, too, so. It feels like. double bed."
705.0,Provider,"yeah exactly tiffany and and part of our coping strategies and looking at it this way it's not to completely release it and it's not to discount what you're feeling. it's learning to know how to take that belief, you have about yourself and make it into something that's more appropriate that's more realistic and meet you where you are today. If we talk even about therapy, most people, this is the last thing that would be on their list that they would be able to complete you got a lot of people saying they need therapy, but people to go out and actually do it."
12138.0,Patient,yeah it's true it's. pretty difficult to keep up with appointments.
705.0,Provider,"keep up with the appointments that but also to to have the courage to say how you really feel and on a day like today, where you don't have as much energy you're not filling out your best today. But you're reaching out and you refuse to give up, so if you're refusing to give up if you're very resilient. determined. yeah wouldn't that be evidence against that you're a failure. If you've had moments that weren't perfect because you're human. That we make mistakes, and we do things and sometimes our circumstances changes the way that we can be where we can live a dictates, where we can work what our financial situation can change. That doesn't define us it just makes it where you know what i've learned from this we're in the event later on when you do have you know where you get your own household. probably going to appreciate it even at a different level."
12138.0,Patient,That had you not not under the.
705.0,Provider,struggle right.
12138.0,Patient,yeah definitely I think so.
705.0,Provider,"yeah and so if we put this back into you know that to me. i'm a failure and refuting that and being like hey I challenge that. What could be even with this one and it takes time, but what would be a new way to start to think of this different instead of i'm a failure, and now we did that list of foreign against what."
12138.0,Patient,would be.
705.0,Provider,more reasonable.
12138.0,Patient,"I mean, I feel like I a survivor like i'm surviving every day."
705.0,Provider,"I am surviving every day. And that right there can help manage every day, where it's like look just for today i'm going to not have to figure out where i'm going to live, because I have a roof over my head. Just for today. You know i'm gonna take in that i'm not going to drive where it where I want to dry."
12138.0,Patient,yeah.
705.0,Provider,"And it's good you know it's good to have i'm not saying like hey you don't don't dream I don't want you know things to be different it's like yeah, of course, but it's also understanding, if you had a broken arm and you were in a cast. Would you want to just take off the cast and start using your arm and maybe go play volleyball."
12138.0,Patient,Right evenly not yeah.
705.0,Provider,"But with mental health disorders it's the same way, is there's like a bandage around because you are still healing you are still where you're not seeing like you're still in the. Recovery stage."
12138.0,Patient,yeah.
705.0,Provider,"And so, thinking of it in terms of look, I still have bandages around me i'm still healing from this. You know expectation that i'm going to be over here. i'm not there yet."
12138.0,Patient,"that's true but there's like so many other things I worry about like obviously I know I have to take this time to take care of myself and do the bare minimum, to just try to wake up, but. there's like outside third factors third party factors that I think about all the time, like what is like when I finally. interview for a job they asked me why i've been on a hiatus for so long, you know. Like how long is this going to take for me to really like work through because there's like obligations, like my loans that I have to pay for. I have like only until May to actually take my exam so it's like it's just a lot that's like putting me in a time constraint in my head, obviously I know I can't do all those things right now. But it's just. Added stress that I have to like think about in the back of my head."
705.0,Provider,"yeah it is, and I get it tiffany where it's just like yes so i'm hearing some of those things do have a timestamp on it, like in May with taking the test is it in May. yeah yeah so it's just like you would like to get to be in a place where you could take the test. yeah and it's just like okay. Can you bring that back into so for today, what I can do about that. Is."
12138.0,Patient,"I don't. I mean. I don't think I can physically like start studying it because literally whenever I do, that I just get super overwhelmed. And i'm not at a mental place to be. studying and taking that on but maybe I can like reschedule my exam today because it's coming up it's supposed to be in November. So that's something that I need to take care of."
705.0,Provider,"You know, and that is something, then bringing it back into your circle of control. Yes, if you can bring it back it might not have been what you had first thought you would be in at that date. But life has changed things have change. And with the recovery part is it does take time and if there are things in your your control, such as changing the date. That maybe that's something that that. You would do. yeah you know what i'm going to take that stressor off of my plate. Right now, is going back to priority what's priority for you right now, today."
12138.0,Patient,i'm getting out of bed. Taking a shower eating something healthy.
705.0,Provider,"So, if any of those things that you listed that you're able to do even if it's like 10 minutes of getting out of bed is being like Okay, you know what I did it i'm going to go for effort i'm not looking you know to accomplish everything was there, an effort, yes."
12138.0,Patient,yeah I think I can definitely get into bed today.
705.0,Provider,that's sometimes to tiffany's is is the hardest part and sometimes people can't get out of it.
12138.0,Patient,yeah definitely.
705.0,Provider,yeah if you can then that's great and even if it's five minutes 10 minutes.
12138.0,Patient,yeah.
705.0,Provider,celebrate that when i'm able to get out of bed.
12138.0,Patient,You know.
705.0,Provider,"If you've been have the energy to take a shower. Take a shower. And big when you know if you're able to do that, if not, it was on your list. And there was effort there, maybe it doesn't happen today, maybe it happens, this evening, or maybe it happens tomorrow. wow. i've worked with people to that are like you know what I don't have the energy to take a full bath so I have wet ones I have a sponge bath that's my when. yeah yeah. I talked to someone just yesterday, which was it's it's very draining for them right now to shampoo their hair. yeah so they were able to purchase some dry shampoo."
12138.0,Patient,hmm.
705.0,Provider,"So finding alternatives that you're still getting what you feel you need to get done. But not taking it internal where oh here's evidence of what's happening with me it's like no i'm gonna be kind to myself and know that it's not always going to be like this. But for today i'm going to go with ease of where I am. And so, if you're able to shower or if it needs to look, you know that alternative solution."
12138.0,Patient,So. i've also been having like. weird dreams about like my partner alive. Which is really weird.
705.0,Provider,Is it in more of a frightening way or more in just a concern.
12138.0,Patient,um it's like. it's more about like. Like him lying or like doing things that are mean to me I don't know it's pretty consistent I probably have these dreams like. Two three times a week.
705.0,Provider,If you're in the the common theme and these dreams as.
12138.0,Patient,is just like. him doing things that he shouldn't be doing to her my few weeks kinda.
705.0,Provider,Would you say then that it's focused around trust or a breach of trust.
12138.0,Patient,"I don't even know because I don't feel like I have those issues with him in real life. Really weird that, like my mind goes to it when I go to sleep."
705.0,Provider,"yeah it is sometimes tiffany where when we go to sleep that our insecurities come out and even if there's no reality basis because you're sharing with me your partner hasn't given you anything to make that like hey here's some proof of this. But your subconscious and it's even coming up to your conscious level before you go to sleep is starting to prey on your insecurities. yeah being able, do you like to to to journal or anything before you go to bed."
12138.0,Patient,"No, I haven't really tried it um I feel like I should definitely start like. Even just typing something in my notes or something."
705.0,Provider,"If if you have, at the end of the day, if you have energy to type something."
12138.0,Patient,yeah and.
705.0,Provider,"Then, that would be good, I also don't want you to give yourself another task. That is yeah yeah so just go day by day."
12138.0,Patient,"Okay, you know i'll try that."
705.0,Provider,"yeah if you need to just think of it, you know, in your mind of again just like we did with the evidence for and against that security is what security do I have with my partner what insecurity, do I have with my partner."
12138.0,Patient,You know.
705.0,Provider,"Where are we today and being able to let go see if some of these things you can let go of where for today he's faithful for today he's been there and been supportive. yeah yeah and in relationships to that that can be very normal to do the the What if and and to feel like ah, you know. I need my time to do this, will he be there, what does he think. What does this mean where's our future and we go. way over there."
12138.0,Patient,"Bring, especially with my depression, I feel like. I don't know Sometimes I feel like I don't really want him to see me like this. Because i'm at a low point in my life, so I don't want to be like nagging or complaining all the time. So."
705.0,Provider,As he ever shared with you that you're nagging or complaining.
12138.0,Patient,"No, but like he trusted encouraged me to study and stuff. But I don't think he really understood I don't think he knows like I haven't I haven't expressed how bad my depression is that I can't even think about that right now i'm just trying to wake up every day, so I think that's a conversation that I need to have with him."
705.0,Provider,"yeah and having that conversation sometimes to can lessen the intensity of those thoughts coming in, especially at night. yeah night is where all of our insecurities seem together right before we go to sleep."
12138.0,Patient,yeah.
705.0,Provider,"coming up with a strategy of of what you can you know do to counteract that so just having that conversation with him. and being able to take the time that you need and to be able to know just like we talked about with sometimes family and friends they're trying because they love you to motivate you but that doesn't mean it has to be motivating for you. And you can share what that's like if that fills you know if you're comfortable with that. yeah. Now, sometimes too it's just like hey i'm trying to figure this out to myself it's like you know look might my prescribed we're and I are working together to try to figure this out because. there's a lot of different factors and metabolize you know how we metabolize things can change well you know you're in the pharmacy. yeah yeah. Definitely right, but having that more broader approach can allow you to feel like you know what I don't feel like i'm searching a time crunch."
12138.0,Patient,yeah.
705.0,Provider,"i'm in the process, I don't know you know where the end is and what day that may be, but i'm figuring out what depression means to me. What are some of the things because sometimes and again it depends on if you can get the right medication, if you can identify before you go into the depression of getting it where the intensity may not be at a 10 it would be less than two maybe an eight."
12138.0,Patient,mm hmm you know.
705.0,Provider,You haven't gone through this before.
12138.0,Patient,No never now.
705.0,Provider,"And that's where each day is just like look I, I am in the discovery zone."
12138.0,Patient,"that's true. I think, for the longest time to I didn't even realize it was depression, I just felt like last."
705.0,Provider,It is now that you have a name right. And now that you know that it is those people say it is 100% legit mental health disorder it happens. Has that helped where maybe the self doubt and your self esteem is at a higher level now because you understand.
12138.0,Patient,"I would say so, because I didn't quite understand why wasn't being motivated I just I just felt like I was my heart wasn't in it. I wasn't. I wasn't being hard working as I used to be so i'm definitely now that I realized it's depression, I feel like. I have a reason to feel this way."
705.0,Provider,"Yes, it starts to make sense and it matches up."
12138.0,Patient,yeah.
705.0,Provider,"Absolutely. I am glad then tiffany that you know that now, and that he have a name to it, and that you know that, yes, this is what i'm going through i'm learning more about it. Just like with medication is sometimes, unfortunately, until you try the medication you don't know how the body's going to react. yeah and then it may take several medications that make you know with depression at a therapeutic level."

Also, getting where you're building up your support network and it's nice when you have people like a counselor to talk to like you and I. i'm not part of the family, and so I don't have already these unbiased I don't know you know it's nice to have a sounding board, just like in group it's nice to have people.
