252.0,Provider,it's kind of mind blowing know.
12816.0,Patient,"it's frustrating it's really frustrating the one doctor I saw and I don't I don't take any payments never been on a paid once a while I mean my surgery but.

252.0,Provider,"Well, what they found is."
12816.0,Patient,People you get on so let's give a shout out to me.
252.0,Provider,What they found is that suboxone. helps with not just covering those receptors that opioids attaches.
12816.0,Patient,In the brain yes.
252.0,Provider,But it also helps with pain. And so.
12816.0,Patient,"I didn't know that. Yes, me too me too bad i'm like like me I Google I think that's what I get for my mom I researched everything. Like one day, would it be put on that."
252.0,Provider,suboxone helps it really kind of covers those pain receptors to and help them with pain as well. So. I don't know people with that. They use it for pain management.
12816.0,Patient,"See I didn't know I just read it, I was like. Excuse my language, sorry but."
252.0,Provider,yeah.
12816.0,Patient,I was like that's the downfall of it i'm going to tell you.
252.0,Provider,"Is that, in order to come off of it, you if you decide you don't want to take it anymore, is that you have to taper down."
12816.0,Patient,Right.
252.0,Provider,yeah just stopped taking it you'll get sick you'll get like.
12816.0,Patient,"that's what scares me like withdrawals right. Yes, so."
252.0,Provider,"I know that a lot of people use it for pain management so i'm throwing that out there, a lot of times with opioid addiction started out because of pain management."
12816.0,Patient,"Because I do know, I do have a friend he's. been in recovery for four years now he's doing amazing and it started out with back surgery yeah. And, and I know I get it, that some people do have a higher chance of becoming addicted because of chemicals in your brain right. or something that people are more apt to become addicted certain people or certain things."
252.0,Provider,"Well, you have to have that predispose gene which you do, because your dad was an alcoholic. Right, so you have that genetic predisposed to it. yeah and so. I mean, it could be alcohol, it could be something that all of a sudden."
12816.0,Patient,"Bam i'm smoking smoking cigarettes, if you took my favorite song i'd probably use my freakin mind. would lose my mind."
252.0,Provider,off of you know that make it.
12816.0,Patient,"harder it's harder than heroin. Yes, i've heard that and I was like that's just I can see why I love ya know. I do have my medicine, the the chantix come off of it. I said smoking. But it makes me so sick of me I literally throw up all day if I take it, so I have to figure out something. Other than that, yes."
252.0,Provider,"Well there's you know the laws injured, as what i've heard people say that works, the best."
12816.0,Patient,yeah okay i'm sorry that I do have some here actually my husband to the va get some nicotine replacement stuff.
252.0,Provider,yeah. Passengers I heard that that little minutes you know you just put in your mouth and.
12816.0,Patient,it's got to give you that.
252.0,Provider,yeah got enough nicotine that it satisfies that craving and. You get past smoking not smoking one will talk about it more.
12816.0,Patient,More sessions okay.
252.0,Provider,If it's something you're interested with.
12816.0,Patient,"tried yeah I definitely am. But. i'm like I said i've had I don't i'm not a drinker i'm not I don't I don't because I didn't know I didn't wanna go same old my dad was on I love my kids to come first, I like it comes first so."
252.0,Provider,"So i'm just I just want to reiterate this that suboxone is used for pain and apricot it's such a minimal the lowest dose is one or two milligrams. And it can be the lowest dose that you that somebody with pain might feel. 100% better without the pain, you know what I mean, so you wouldn't know that until you talk to the pain management."
12816.0,Patient,"Right, because the only thing i've ever been given for pain was. I didn't it was a small oxycodone. five milligrams that's all i've ever been given and that helped me they got twice a day, then, but then I got pregnant, I said I didn't want anymore cuz slow, you can still take it, you can you both you guys stop before you have a baby like i'm not taking anything when i'm pregnant."
252.0,Provider,yeah.
12816.0,Patient,"And when I went back after I was done breastfeeding, I went back to go back on my muscle relaxers and that my doctor had moved she moved at stake in the PA that was it took over here, let me go F my hand so."
252.0,Provider,yeah it's probably when. Crisis was coming up and doctors were getting it yeah.
12816.0,Patient,"You know I know it's been bad, I know I know it's awful."
252.0,Provider,it's very limited by give lucky if you get you know any kind of opioid medication.
12816.0,Patient,"Oh, I know I know like no that's fine I don't have an issue at all, I just want to have pain. And I don't want to be addicted to anything either at same time. Yes, you know that's just scary."
252.0,Provider,um and there's a difference between. psychologically addicted and physically by the.
12816.0,Patient,outcome okay.
252.0,Provider,"be physically addicted to something and not want it psychologically. Oh, you know what I mean, knowing that your body is going to need it for pain. yeah rainbow say how are we supposed to do this without it. i'm just saying that."
12816.0,Patient,"You know, but I get what i'm saying."
252.0,Provider,Because you're predisposed.
12816.0,Patient,"Right, that is a conservative it gets yeah I know I know I understand that. I do understand that."
252.0,Provider,anyways I will refer you to pain management I.
12816.0,Patient,can save that.
252.0,Provider,and talk to chantelle to about it. Okay okay. Your doctor and all refer you then she can direct you in the right direction to.
