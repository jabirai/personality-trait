540.0,Provider,"Alright, for transcription I am meeting with Dan and Davis for an individual therapy session i'm going to let her in right now."
7456.0,Patient,Hello.
540.0,Provider,hi how are you.
7456.0,Patient,i'm.
540.0,Provider,Okay what's going on.
7456.0,Patient,"Why, I asked for a different doctor because i'm. Yesterday I had a family wedding is like hours away from my home and my my one year old daughter was In it, she was the flower girl 100 Walker down. And i'm running three o'clock which was fine, so it was the group, so I call before then and they're like okay we'll cancel it now, I was like okay cool. So they were like okay well we'll get your script tomorrow or talk to Dr agoa if you'll get your script drawn i'm like okay. So I go to pick up my script today and there's like only six and that will only make it till Saturday, and my pharmacies not open on the weekends, and I mean she knows that, but she obviously didn't listen when I told her or she has too many people, so I don't know. Another thing was um i'm going to go to the bedroom and she did that because I missed my appointment with you. And I mean like I mean you know you've called I mean like you've cancelled do like you know, on our appointments, which I have no problem with but um it's like. You know I mean like you're allowed to do stuff like that, but like i'm not and then usually, when she docs me she only docs me every four days, what is six suboxone going to do for me, you know I mean."
540.0,Provider,"So i'm not positive on the prescription side of it, I can reach out to Dr agoa to see what's going on over there, I mean it says that you're due for the BAM survey, but everything else is green it's not even saying anything for compliance, for me, so I don't really know i'm. Not flagged or anything for any compliance for seeing me because we already had one session this month, I believe."
7456.0,Patient,"yeah so. yeah six six is only gonna get me Saturday, and my pharmacy is not open on the weekend and i'm just like and just because, like just because I missed one meeting. You know, like Scotia like This all goes to like hell i'm just sick of it i'm sick of this place like i'm honestly i'm. i'm going to look for another there's I know there's another place in town for this stuff because i'm just sick of this shit i'm like before this I went to a place called groups and."
540.0,Provider,This yeah.
7456.0,Patient,"Was it easy, they did not punish you for missing, something that did not punish you for doing anything and i'm just sick of it i'm so sick of it like it's enough to make me quit."
540.0,Provider,"it's sick man, and I know it's something that you've been frustrated with with the whole compliance thing if you have something in your town that has less things that you have to do for treatment as. fitting for you, Dan and you got it, you have to do what is best for you and not. And if it's not bright heart health it's not bright heart health. So I mean I what I can do is I can have them look at referrals to see other places in your area, but if you have something in mind, do you have a place in mind."
7456.0,Patient,um I mean i've heard of this one other place but I didn't get back to me okay. If you have referrals yeah i'd love to have them because I just don't want to go here anymore.
540.0,Provider,"Okay. All right, so why don't I. Alright, do you want me so do you want me to put like an increase in saying that you're going to be looking to discharge, but you want referrals to Inpatient."
7456.0,Patient,"yeah also look, you know for myself."
540.0,Provider,"Okay, because I, because usually so when the discharge processes going for that will talk to Dr Otto a little bit about it, but I think that usually you're given like a 30 day script. And whether or not you use the referrals that we can find you or you find a place but usually you're, given that, and then it kind of wraps up your care so you know I usually during that time you don't do any individual counseling anything like that. yeah all right, so why don't we will plan for that i'll put in like an inquiry for you, so that I get some referrals they'll probably email them to you so just check on your email in the next few days, a little bit before groups so by then you should have some referrals. Okay okay. Okay, good all right, how are you feeling otherwise."
7456.0,Patient,"i'm feeling great i'm feeling good i'm a little i'm just tired, because that was exhausting. um because, like, I have a one year old and. It was my it was my fiance sister's wedding and. She made she scared like she made it at this mountain shadows retreat place. And so the family stayed at like this. fancy big place for a couple days, which sounds great right and it has, but it was hell, for me, I was literally in hell, the whole time because my one year old daughter wanted to go everywhere and outside there's hills and roxanne it's on a freakin mountain place it's on a mountainside."
540.0,Provider,Daddy.
7456.0,Patient,"yeah so I was just in hell, I was in hell, the whole time I was fucking miserable. Duty have no idea I basically was chasing my daughter, the whole time that's basically all I was doing was chasing my daughter. And then, like i'm like my my boyfriend would like you would like you know talk with other people and mingle and then like i'd get mad at him because. he'd be like mingling and i'd be like chasing the child around you know so i'd be like all bitchy about it and they were like make you feel bad, but."
540.0,Provider,But then did he ever tried to let you mingle and then.
7456.0,Patient,"Oh no yeah yeah no he. Totally did. It was just um the whole thing just was fucked it was I just honestly I would never want to do it again ever. If it's somewhere more child friendly and on a freakin mountain side, where their hills or my daughter can literally die. I don't keep track on her you know I mean."
540.0,Provider,yeah so you can really enjoy yourself it's crazy how having kids it really changes the way that you I don't know appreciate event yeah.
7456.0,Patient,"yeah I know she's my life like I love her and. I love her so much, but it's just the whole time it was it was so miserable it was hard to do anything and it's like and it's someone else's day you know it's their wedding so God forbid, if you complain, there is no complaining because it's not your day. you're fine you know what I mean. miserable."
540.0,Provider,How many days are you guys there.
7456.0,Patient,"We were there for. We were there for one day for the rehearsal which we honestly didn't need to be there, but his sister like. wanted us wanted us to be there, or she'd like you know throw a fit about it. She just loves her family, you know they're very close family, they all like to be together, which I, I honestly I don't understand because I don't have a family like that so. I guess it's good I don't know but i'm there um so we went for the report we showed up for herself, but we didn't get there to like four and then we stayed till the next day, which was the wedding but we plan to leave after the wedding so really we only stayed like a day and a half. Okay, and then, when we got all ready to go, we got all packed up. It was nighttime people were intoxicated because it was the reception. And it's like you know that made me even more frustrated because, like I couldn't get drunk you know, like if my dog, I have my dog or like I can't get shipped base so everybody's like ship is running around having fun, you know."

7456.0,Patient,"Oh, my God yeah yeah i'm super excited. yeah i'm very excited because, like i'm you know my daughter is like my life so i'm excited I want another one."
540.0,Provider,"and giving her another little one to grow with and almost two years, I mean they call it, like the Irish twins but almost two years, like that's a good kind of gap between them."
7456.0,Patient,"Right yeah you don't want too big, of a gap, because they won't want nothing to do with each other, you know they'll one will just be annoying to the other. yeah if you have the right gap there'll be best friends, you know, because the way the way I always wanted it to be with my children is I wanted you know I wanted them to have each other, you know what I mean and just be really close."
540.0,Provider,"yeah and I think like the two to three years or even like 123 years is like a good gap, or like they'll still be in school together. Yes, kind of go through those milestones together."
7456.0,Patient,"yeah exactly I Oh, I definitely want them to be in school together so they can look out for each other, you know yeah."
540.0,Provider,"Well, I mean you're doing it exactly right right way right time."
7456.0,Patient,"yeah yeah I know that would make me sad if they weren't in school together, you know you mean, because if, like one of them got in a fight. The other one could come and like get right in there and kick some ass together, you know that would make me sad, so I wouldn't I definitely would want them to be in the same school together."
540.0,Provider,You have siblings right.
7456.0,Patient,"Yes, I have. I have four brothers and one sister."
540.0,Provider,what's the age gaps between you guys.
7456.0,Patient,"i'm i'm 30 I just turned 32 I in August. And my sisters 37 and my brothers like. 36 and my other brother he's 10 years older than me. And then there's another one that's um he's actually a lot closer to my age, but um he died when I was 18 so."
540.0,Provider,"Sorry, you were you were a team when he passed."
7456.0,Patient,"yeah my dad died when I was two to. My job my. i'm like i'm kind of like embarrassed by my family because there's like my family's been through some. shit you know I mean because, like you see all these families and they're like all happy and then you see my family and it's like my data, and I was too, and my brother died, and I was 18 like my mom's on drugs like my family screwed up it's embarrassing it's very embarrassing."
540.0,Provider,"Well it's and it's weird because it feels taboo when you see like families that are actually like you're like Oh, this is how is supposed to be."
7456.0,Patient,Is that how it's supposed to yeah. yeah yeah it is. It is no I mean you know it's very nice it's very nice when I see other families that are like put together and like they're really close.
540.0,Provider,"And you going through it, it kind of allows you to take the chance to change it, for your kids so being able to show them what a family is supposed to look like the love between you two and just that family net."
7456.0,Patient,"yeah yeah. um I mean like i'm when I was younger I used to want that, like I used to want like a mom and a dad and everything, and I mean I I. With them. And I mean like I still kind of do you know, like, I mean it would be nice say what have been nice. But because of like all that shit you know what I mean it kind of just makes you like It made me like a warrior To be honest, because i'm a. very strong like nothing fazes you like your husband could leave you your family could leave you like. Somebody could die or I don't know i'm telling i'm telling like shocking shift that happened to me and I will be able to deal with it, like, I will be able to handle it because i've been through like. Some crazy shit you know, so it just makes you like it makes you a fucking warrior no. that's the only good thing about it."
540.0,Provider,"I mean there's some good things, but the warrior. i'd say is one of the biggest things. And it's I mean you're not naive to the world. So you know the word I mean maybe the worst of it, but it kind of has that tolerance for being able to if something bad happens it's not going to break you because my body had all of these things happen."
7456.0,Patient,yeah.
540.0,Provider,So all around you're good you've been doing good.
7456.0,Patient,"Oh yes, yeah i'm doing very good my family is very happy we're very happy i'm just this by Hurricane irritated me."
540.0,Provider,"Well, why don't we let's get you to another place that is going to be more fitting for you. The compliance thing it's not going to go away there's only so much that Dr Otto and I can do we're kind of coffee, with a lot of that stuff. So if you have something in your area that is less of like the compliance, where you can do less without doing all of these surveys, all of the individual counseling groups. yeah then Danny you got to do what's right for you and your family."
7456.0,Patient,"And um I have a I have a friend who goes to bright heart to do the same thing, and they don't have to do anything."
540.0,Provider,Like that i'm going to circle back around right.
7456.0,Patient,"yeah they don't miss anything and. i'm just like what the hell like i'm like, how do you get away with all this shit in there, I don't know how they do it, they just they can get away with anything and it's like that for everybody in there and."
540.0,Provider,"So it's really dependent, I mean, I know that all of my groups, the system has gotten very, very strict, so I don't know if other groups are just not up to that, but. I mean, I know people left and right are we getting discharged for not getting these surveys in and not getting compliant with any of that so even when it comes, like you, like a certain people are getting discharged for those things too so. yeah it's. Not a perfect system there's never gonna be. But like I said we got to find out what system is going to be best for you."
7456.0,Patient,"yeah I mean i'm. I mean it's kind of like also good, too, because it really, really, really, really to me when I quit I don't I don't honestly I did realize, though, like a seven months ago, though I relapse so I don't I wouldn't say i'm ready to quit. And it does make me want to quit like suboxone when this shit happens, it makes me want to quit like that day and it just makes me want to quit because I just get so sick of it, you know."
540.0,Provider,"Well, Dan and if. It fits the program there's always another program so know that yeah you don't have to be stuck to this program. And what about going back to the group's place, is it not near you anymore or."
7456.0,Patient,"No, what happened with them is they were completely free like you didn't even have to have medical for them. And then their government grant like stopped or whatever. So now they charge you."
540.0,Provider,"Oh, like i'm private thing."
7456.0,Patient,"yeah and i'm not going to pay for suboxone or methadone or whatever. Any of that shit i'm not going to pay for it, because, if I have to start paying for it i'll quit you know what I mean because i'm I was never. I got on suboxone in the first place, because i'm. Like a friend suggested it to me. I didn't do heroin, I honestly i'm when I met this friend, I had never done drugs, I had never done heroin I had never done meth, the only thing I had really done was opiates like pills, you know and and also, I was drinking a lot, because my marriage had ended. So I was drinking quite a bit, they should honestly, they should offer it to alcoholics to um."
540.0,Provider,I know some do like Rhode island we we offer it to alcoholics because.
7456.0,Patient,"I yeah. I wasn't I was basically an alcoholic when they when he showed it to me because my marriage is ending, and you know I didn't want to feel so I just drink and. I probably would be imprisoned by now if it wasn't for suboxone because I would still be drinking and what I drank I got wild I got violent and I got aggressive. you've done because i'm Indian i'm like native American. So i'm like yeah when that's when they showed me suboxone and I was like this should tie. And I quit drinking and I quit teaching opiate and i've been on it like ever since so."
540.0,Provider,So you found what works for you.
7456.0,Patient,"mm hmm i'm very thankful, though, because if I would have kept drinking I don't know what would have happened."
540.0,Provider,"Now you got those walls eventually only babies, but you got that baby so."
7456.0,Patient,yeah.
540.0,Provider,You have a different now you're at a different point of your life too.
7456.0,Patient,"yeah yes very, very, very, very different."
540.0,Provider,Very different as evidence of that wedding.
7456.0,Patient,hahaha.
540.0,Provider,"So, Dan, and so I will contact them to get these referrals going so. You get the process of like the discharge for them to I think that usually Dr ARGO would be doing, like a 30 day script until you connect with those referrals okay."
7456.0,Patient,mm hmm.
540.0,Provider,"Alright, so i'll put that in Korean today."
7456.0,Patient,"But also asked her about the six subs, because that will not last me and my pharmacy is closed on the weekend, so I will be screwed."
540.0,Provider,"So, Dan and what I want you to do is actually do you have the pharmacy rx. code to call in call them now and let them know that your pharmacy is closed on Saturdays and you're not gonna be able to get any scripts so you'll be out of the box and so maybe tomorrow they'll be able to call something in."
7456.0,Patient,i'm actually they're closer now so i'll have to call tomorrow okay.
540.0,Provider,"Okay, are they Oh, I thought they were open till 9pm okay."
7456.0,Patient,Our so called that's what that's what the virtual clinic. person told me is that correct. i'm pretty sure it is right.
540.0,Provider,"i'm sure it's correct so then call right in the morning, then. Okay okay."
7456.0,Patient,"but can you just messaged her, and I see why she messaged me if she made a mistake, like, I would like her to fix it, you know I mean because six is like that's ridiculous."
540.0,Provider,yeah so i'll.
7456.0,Patient,"get into the How crazy, that is."
540.0,Provider,No message her.
7456.0,Patient,"Okay. And if you can like would you just let me know what happened, or like message me or something. yeah Okay, thank you."

7456.0,Patient,Also do my am my Bam serving.
540.0,Provider,"All right, yeah do the BAM survey and then by fire group Wednesday we should know what's happening with the discharge process and referrals okay."
7456.0,Patient,"Well, so why did they say why did they make me and get six if you said i'm all good."
540.0,Provider,"i'm not positive, so I all i'm seeing green here, so I don't know what and sometimes it's an insurance so sometimes insurance has been done thing i've been hearing from patients from my other California groups that insurance has been playing around so it could be your insurance to."
7456.0,Patient,me okay I don't think it is. yeah if you could like contact her and. tell her that.
540.0,Provider,"yeah all right, I will. All right, i'll do that right when we get off here okay."
7456.0,Patient,"Okay, thank you."
540.0,Provider,can always buy didn't.
7456.0,Patient,buy.
540.0,Provider,"right for transcription I do want to know too. So we'll be getting the wheels in motion for a discharge process Dan has been pretty frustrated with compliance and how much she has to do with being and bright heart health so she does feel like there's other options for her in person, where she's living, so I will get. Case managers care navigators to work on a list for her for referrals in her area and then we'll just start the discharge process for her and. Other than that nothing for transcription."
