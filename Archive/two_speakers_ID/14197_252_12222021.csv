I don't know he wants to know why, and I can't never tell them why. yeah once once in a while, but that stuff just comes out of the closet and jumps on yep."
252.0,Provider,"yeah and you know it can do that, and it can come on for no reason but generally in in most times it's what's going on inside of your head that starts it."
14197.0,Patient,"yeah I don't I totally know that, because my head never turns off Rebecca and it's that's something I wanted to talk to you about um. I cannot. Every minute, my mind's thinking it's usually it's the past and it's about it could be kindi garden, it could be, it could be good, it could be bad. I don't want to think about that those people it's nobody's important or anything Why am I constantly thinking about the past, like that, like I said it could be, all the way back to second grade. And it's I had no trauma with these people laudable me out but it's like, why does this person you pop into my head, I met him twice at school or something you know what I mean. But it's a ruin me is, I cannot turn off my head I I never go forward, I never think of today or tomorrow and uh my dreams are the same way, they all it's like it's like I can wake up every day Rebecca and write a small story about who and what was it in my dream. mm hmm it gets really old."
252.0,Provider,And are they generally good dreams are they bad dreams.
14197.0,Patient,"yeah no and it's like, why is this person in my dream, you know, there are people from my past laudable lot of my ex aloe lot with my ex drug. lot. Like a lot but it's there's. Never you know it's like why. You made a met this person two or three times that's not even like wildlife waste my time thinking about it, but my dream. It I tell my boy I get up and just start rolling blah blah blah blah like he's like what were you, what do you know um it's not one. yeah and I don't I take a value, you know I don't flop drugged up. To me out the dream."
252.0,Provider,yeah well there's a lot of it sounds like there's a lot of stuff from your past that's unresolved and. trauma and it seems that you've experienced in your past hmm.
14197.0,Patient,"i've had a lot of trauma. Oh no I wanted to tell you i'm not really I told you last boy was second rate i'm not a ball yeah what you did all that right now. I don't think. at her she's thinking, this will only only i'm not a bully."
252.0,Provider,I don't think you're bullying.
14197.0,Patient,"voiced or so, but no i'm not a bully."
252.0,Provider,So I don't think you're a bully bully Michelle so.
14197.0,Patient,"The drapes or something I just keep forgetting to break too, but it's a big big deal because it can ruin my day when i'm wake up and i'm in i'm still in my dream so vividly that like I say I can I can sit and tell you a story."
252.0,Provider,"I think that what you need to do is when you wake up and you've had these vivid dreams, you need to write them down."
14197.0,Patient,"I father, I found that before I didn't know why, but right what I dreamed. Yes, just like what what i'm thinking still. Yes, Okay, because it's like. it's like I you know and. There are a lot of different people that were alive. best friend. From junior high school that is always there I don't want I want, I want to be there, you know what I mean."
252.0,Provider,"yeah and so something's you know sounds to me like your subconscious is trying to process some things, while you're sleeping and that's why you're dreaming a lot you get up and if they're in your mind you write them down."
14197.0,Patient,You don't sense of them you don't question them you just write.
252.0,Provider,them down. yeah.
14197.0,Patient,"What I woke up with. Okay cuz it fits. it's miserable. Then I get so jealous I hear. I hear my other half going on, even dream, you know. I, like you, don't I don't like green me there."
252.0,Provider,"yeah some people they you know when they've got resolved trauma and there's things in their past that they have not been able to process through or work through. They will, it will be their mind will just be so colorful and so vivid and and continue bringing up all these memories, with no rhyme or reason."
14197.0,Patient,"yeah and Mike most of them just went away, they never been resolved, but but they happen to me, you know, in the with the X, you know that was 21 years of what do they call that when you're not when you're about why. Not one of those for 21 years. You know the money was there, but so as all the abuse and the drugs."
252.0,Provider,yeah and that's huge.
14197.0,Patient,"The Iranian care about the money you know and it's not good when somebody you know calling you ugly names and stuff. yeah I know yeah i'd rather get yet, then the way I got spoke to."
252.0,Provider,"yeah, no matter what emotional abuse is way way worse."
14197.0,Patient,"You know I don't like to be hit but. it's hard to shake stuff like that, and let me like you all, not one person in all my 16 years not has one person talk to me and tried to help me like you all do."
252.0,Provider,Good i'm glad.
14197.0,Patient,"And I mean that you know i've seen and been around a lot, no. No, nobody anywhere that has been like you all, and my caseworker. For the inference even says that because I compliment and say how much I like y'all he just is very impressed by what I tell them about Joel."
252.0,Provider,Well that's what we're here for right.
14197.0,Patient,On that sent me where your way you know. emerged bill and weird because it's like nobody's ever cared like my my psychiatrist 10 years like top three works with during that was seeing three months. yeah well. And I tried to get some help the housing told me get a caregiver. Who I am entitled to. And I asked her to sign a paper for me she's just mercial do you laundry. Like you aren't so rude.
252.0,Provider,it's funny.
14197.0,Patient,"She is she is how the. southeastern or whatever, but it's like I never had nobody that cared is what i'm getting. Like all you do."
252.0,Provider,"you're good, and you know another thing to do after you wake up and you're you've written down what was in your head, you know. is to really just sit for a second take a look at your surroundings and you have to tell yourself i'm okay. i'm in the present yeah That was my past it's okay i'm safe. i'm okay."
14197.0,Patient,"You know what I do I come sit straight now I don't even P, yet, and I feel my bowl of. About 9am yeah Rebecca."
252.0,Provider,So you know your that's your go to.
14197.0,Patient,"Right it's my it's my it's my. I think it's gonna fix everything it's like my best friend it's like it's gonna make me Okay, but I know a lot."
252.0,Provider,yeah because all of those certainly rest emotions are still sitting in there.
14197.0,Patient,yeah.
252.0,Provider,"yeah and they're coming out, you know in in your dreams. You know what I mean and so you've got to be able to write it down and process through you've got to be able to tell yourself you're saying every."
14197.0,Patient,Year.
252.0,Provider,hmm.
14197.0,Patient,"That tell me, this is what real it doesn't exist. it's gone it's gone you're in."
252.0,Provider,yeah.
14197.0,Patient,Did it.
252.0,Provider,"yeah and sometimes will be so stuck in the past, because we haven't processed things, and you know marijuana it's good for a lot of things and i'll tell you one thing is good for is to suppress the emotions that need to be processed."
14197.0,Patient,"I do know that. I. Big know that I think that's another reason I hang on so tight that because I way do know that. there's good and bad i'm i'm quite aware, and all the 40 years i've smoked. You know i'm i'm not no dummy, but I am because I can't give it up i'm so addicted but."
252.0,Provider,You know.
14197.0,Patient,"I know the goods and bads maybe probably not all of them i'm not you know, but I I do know they are goods and bads. yeah for sure, but I can't do it by myself Rebecca. I I just cannot. No i'm. Just you know him it's like an hour from here and I almost wanted to tell him like you know if you've had no intentions of whatsoever put me in a facility, I would rather just not waste my time and come in there, but I did not do that made the appointment and we'll find out."
252.0,Provider,"Okay, good."
14197.0,Patient,That you know he knows that I need in treatment.
252.0,Provider,mm hmm good.
14197.0,Patient,"Not as dumb as I thought he was I didn't get done, but I know you're not a drug doctor, are you know."
252.0,Provider,yeah there I don't know I think our medical people are starting to finally get a clue.
14197.0,Patient,"You know you're absolutely right, you know about about a lot of things. Oh, that was."
252.0,Provider,"So go to that appointment be honest with them about your marijuana use, and you know what you want, what your goal Is your goal is is to live a life that you don't have to be dependent on. marijuana."
14197.0,Patient,"anything's been as ours was I don't want to be 10 depending on nobody, but my own style you know. And I am like said it. He woke me up to my call with you and I was already sitting downloading my pipe. mm hmm nobody knows me. My town don't know me least in 10 years he's never been around me one minute that I."
252.0,Provider,I bet you you don't know you.
14197.0,Patient,I told you that last time I talked to you i'm sure I don't know me. I might be scared to know me.
252.0,Provider,"I am, for some reason I don't think, so I think you're gonna find an awesome lady."
14197.0,Patient,"You know I am pretty cool it's like a lot of problems, but you know what I i'll stand up to my slumping will notice that was pretty cool for."
252.0,Provider,"Very much so, and this is about, you know 2022 is going to be an awesome year Michelle. you've got to keep and that's what you have to remember you've got to stay out of the negative headspace those negative thoughts that are anxiety producing. yeah stay out of them and you've got to write down your dreams, so they can start becoming processed right they can get out of you."
14197.0,Patient,"Like. Like things that been. Back in Ada you know I married up with the Aryan brotherhood which i'm still married to. Less it. away by it, so I don't know. But I know a lot about things I shouldn't have done, you know and why, can I let it go you. told me to sneak stuff in around doing stuff that gives my judge a man that and and. That he's been for my abusive husband. But why it was 30 something years Rebecca that. It was pretty traumatizing it really was being married generic brother."
252.0,Provider,had been.
14197.0,Patient,"Oh. i'm not scared of being killed, no more. which I was for many years, because you just you know little bit i'm sure that. you're all I ran out on and stuff but i'm not scared to being killed it's just the fact of it and it still it it just Aaron brotherhood doesn't leave my thing."
252.0,Provider,Right that's was a traumatic event that you have not processed through yet.
14197.0,Patient,They even told my clothes and you know so there's all kinds of kaka there.
252.0,Provider,"mm hmm very much so, and that's Why would make sense that you would write out your dreams when they come."
14197.0,Patient,In their.
252.0,Provider,hmm.
14197.0,Patient,"And then, like read them myself like when i'm not in the dream right knit. or something and check it out."
252.0,Provider,I say that you just write them down once you get engaged and get a clear head.
14197.0,Patient,"Then, maybe check it out."
252.0,Provider,"Right, but just write them down you don't have to read them just any they don't even have to make sense it's just what's in your mind right then."
14197.0,Patient,right and left the book.
252.0,Provider,"mm hmm just write it down and then, once you get to that point where you've met with a doctor and that part of you is in process, you get a clear head. These will be able to to go right through and you'll be able to process it but you've got to change your thought process you've got to change the way that you talk to yourself you've got to remind yourself that you're safe."
14197.0,Patient,"yeah because I don't I I don't know how to do that, you just said that right, because I i'm you know my man it's just I know I don't never feel safe i'm still scared to death abandonment, you know, and I i'm safe here my wrench $200 and 75. I don't have to worry about being a band is already being like that, because i'm staying here, you know. As far as my living situation that."
252.0,Provider,"there's a whole piece of it that you have to. Okay, so what happens when we've gone through years and years of trauma and we have lived in that fight or flight in our head we've lived on the edge and that's where our mind has been for a long time. waiting for the next shoe to drop waiting for the next pain waiting for the next trauma right."
14197.0,Patient,"So right, why do I feel good right now, when i'm known for years to come and talk my way of thinking up."
252.0,Provider,"So we have to have to slowly pull herself off that ledge and tell ourselves remind ourselves. That we're safe, everything is okay, and we have to stay out of that past and remind ourselves those chapters are written that's done and gone. i'm not there anymore I don't have to continually relive it i'm here, we have to work on keeping you in the present moment and develop those skills. So that your. subconscious can get off that ledge."
14197.0,Patient,That quarter tindy garden and second grade you know it like burst of abuses.
252.0,Provider,mm hmm.
14197.0,Patient,"And then, all. Because we call the police, you know, a lady in second grade I can hear it right now. Rebecca she called me she asked for Michelle and I don't i'm surely I don't like to be Michelle because it's just a little too serious. And she just wanted in my bathroom back up to my second grade that eyes in she'd asked me for Michelle is all she wanted to say was meet me in the bathroom in the morning and stick a weenie in your crack. And so, of course, they I had to stay home from school, I have to say, those words to the COPs you know even sicker great. work. yeah Thank you like like we're giving it even now."
252.0,Provider,"Because I was traumatizing and you know you've lived on the edge, for a very long time, you had yourself and a lot of traumatic relationships and serious you know stuff your mind is still reeling from all of the trauma it hasn't even been able to you know process, the first one."
14197.0,Patient,You re hey.
252.0,Provider,You know.
14197.0,Patient,"You know when. I started. A couple times I went back to it, I love it let it go, you know I thought about writing a book. I was talking to somebody that has published a book and I said I didn't think about it and I didn't call my dad Daddy I mean we were to tell me where was we didn't say Daddy. And the title of my book, would be death they call me crazy. Who, I told it to so you know that's really good title and, if nothing else, you can do it for. South. what's the word I want."
252.0,Provider,Self healing.
14197.0,Patient,"Yes, yes, I could, if nothing else, you could do it for that, because you know it good went up tell you what people like to read that. Could. It be good work, but you don't even know if I could get back on it, because it's their weight we're right, where I left off. mm hmm just for my own hair."
252.0,Provider,But you've got to make you know you've got to get you got to get in the headspace that once you write it down you're going to let it go.
14197.0,Patient,"that's what I want that's that's where I think. This person said, you know it would be good for healing. is, I think, for the reason you just said just to get it out write it down and then say bye bye. nice day bye bye write it down and it be gone."
252.0,Provider,And there's a whole nother piece where that little girl. That little girl that went through those traumatic experiences and you need to go back inside yourself and love her and make her feel safe.
14197.0,Patient,"at all. that's not Nelson I wanted to. have my doctor in Vegas quite a while back, I was with him my psychologist right 15 years. And what he asked me, I was well aware of, he says he says, are you aware of that you act like a little girl At times I just start crying because I am well aware of it. And what i've been told, when you start doing drugs at like 12 years old, you like that's where you are getting away because that's where you kind of put a spot to your right and growing. And that's what i've been told, and I do live with us me when I get scared or nervous about something that's like I call it adult and adult situation. or virtual little girl and it's hard to live with i've been like it for many years and then my doctor notice saying that was like Oh, but. it's hard to live with cuz i'm not stupid I don't know if the dollar APP like adult, but I could go to a little girl like if something scared me what a rock or a little little girl like quit."
252.0,Provider,that's a little girl inside of you that needs to be secure. And we do that by going back to those points and we love her. And we hold her and we tell her world hey.
14197.0,Patient,"that's. It. that's all I ever wanted is to know that you love me and want me anybody know I got a kid whether you probably don't know. he's almost 50 years old, so please tell him I can't see straight he's gay is sugar Daddy let's support him last 15 years now it's sugar Daddy to go Fuck himself and what's your new he's never worked and he's on he's doing math you know I talked to him that much. Does he know care about me like a mom or anything you know it cares about jake he he told me that great up you know I I kind of us, I kind of accused him elder abuse with my mother and her diet and everything, and I still stand by it. As I didn't talk to him for a long time and. We need he did how I got him touch time to get him to talk to me. So I was blessed believing wrought with beautiful teeth."
252.0,Provider,mm hmm.
