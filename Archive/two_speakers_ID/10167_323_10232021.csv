I had a crazy time this week I needed to talk to somebody and I went to my probation officer and told her what happened, and she said Oh, then you can call me anytime you want, you know you got my number, I was like I didn't know it was like that you know I mean. there's another person i'm going to tell you, their name all right, because I know they're in right heart health or the person who told me about right heart health. Okay, she lives down the street, she was the person that was no budget that was told me about right heart health all right, she lives like down the street her name's Angela breeding I know your name because her dope dealer came to my house. Trying to sell me do the other day. wow yeah I was standing outside with my dog content and white jeep cherokee blows the articles up to me, I didn't know who was never saw the vehicle I looked and it was one of the Dudes that I met through her. And what's up as i'm sorry i'm straight good oh I haven't seen you in a while. Take an Angela on anything I said i'm straight I didn't want to be too much of a dicta mega retaliate or something. Right, why would somebody such like i'm sorry, did you draw drain thing. Oh that's good man congratulations, he said he goes, what do you do. I run a couple businesses, you want to come work for me. I said no, thank you. yeah i'm on my way to angela's house and it just made me sick, do you know I mean it ruined, my name is. Ruth Okay, I had to think about that shit all day long not do about doing it, but I was just totally disgusted man and like I was on my mind all day. yeah give me a bad day anyways and then on top of that, we went into work and I had my other son naked as we've got mental issues. Right and i've been trying to get them into see a doctor well I got him a point for next week because. he's telling me he's up in the morning time when I get up and I thought that he's been waking up early here, he hasn't been sleeping per day. No, and he says he tells me equal if I tells me after after freaked out at work and it tells me I believe every day, and when I lay down at night I just can't fall asleep all the attention spans and goes all these thoughts racing and racing racing. I don't want to take medicine it's great. So this meeting pissed off at work. Thursday, it was Thursday and when we first got there, and he freaked out in the middle of work and we're in front of people and shift, so he. started cussing throwing shit kicked the door open so, then I took out a whole talk to all got him in the car to come home. But. And then i'm thinking about it when I get them home and shit I can't work there no more for real just because, not just because of that, just because of the simple fact I don't make any money it's it's it he doesn't need to be working right now he's got a. he's he's only 16 now. Right he's gotta get on the school and his mental illness chin and figure out why you get so mad, and all this other shit to figure that stuff out, so I went and. I fill out some applications, please call me back and I went there, and he can you take a drug test, and I said yeah so first time ever, I took a drug test and. I got hired so I start my day and it's a. 1850 an hour like way more my i'm making 12 right now."

323.0,Provider,i'm glad you contacted the probation officer to it's just some extra support.
10167.0,Patient,"Because. I talked to her when I go there, I don't just go to see her and she doesn't even draw testament really anymore, you know I mean she said, the wasted accounting money. She knows i'm doing everything I was supposed to do and i'm trying hard you know I mean she sees that and she probably doesn't have a lot of people that do do that so. But she told me she really nice girl, and she showed it to me, oh no stay away from those people I said I am. Right your sobriety."
323.0,Provider,yeah that was definitely glad you're going to a meeting that was a test really. yeah yeah.
10167.0,Patient,"it's crazy man. yeah here, it shows me that day, and I see how people relapse and stuff you know I mean just like that. Oh, you could probably do it, but i'm different i'm just i'm totally done, you know I mean I can't I don't want that kind of stuff in my life or more those. People jadedness i'm trying to better myself and now it's got a hard thing to do, I gotta call this guy that's helped me Oscar and tell them I can't work there no more. Because my buddy from there came over after work last night and I told him Jeff if there's a new general manager she had even get that job they got a new guy coming in, and all this other shit so i'm glad I did what I did you know."
