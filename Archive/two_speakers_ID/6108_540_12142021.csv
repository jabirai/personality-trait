Building a home inside in the garage because it's like it's huge, it must be a store on one side and Raj, on the other, like the automotive repair or whatever I guess. we're taking every part that was the store and hopefully we'll be able to use the garage is part of his business. We have started running this business and we lost the place, we were at so that kind of went downhill from there quit bad, but. yeah. So so Dalton just like Kansas, where they know i'm doing something I wrapped up."

It was going to use the building, you know just basically phrase businesses and when he found out that we were looking for a place. And what had you know they went through the fire and everything where we're trying to rebuild and everyone would say you know with family or whatever they keep going out.

Between trying to work and getting us based on and having the money for it, which kind of trying to reach out to places for some kind of supplies and stuff you know that help us like water tank I was up there, like at least $300 for water team and bringing. My shower everything. trying to get what we can and i'm on the phone a lot with the free dealer right. it's just trying to do, and not lose our minds, together with having everything to do is we stay pretty busy, though I don't think there's time to be stressed out."
540.0,Provider,"Also, knowing that everything that you're doing each day is. Leading and building up to that so you know that you have the place, you know that it's there it's physical."

6108.0,Patient,"or trying to but not really right now we're trying to come up with some supplies for it, when you like drywall and you need some way for board and whatnot. having to do that, right now, the money thing is kind of. annoying I guess. And how much, are you guys."
540.0,Provider,Are you guys making like a decent amount doing what you're doing like to be able to pay for. That or.
6108.0,Patient,"Yes, yes and no it just depends on what we have to do for the day like Sundays, we can work 1216 hour day, and maybe only pulling $100 together. But and then there's the days, where we can bring in 300 and something burn work in you know six or eight hours, it just depends on what we're doing. And what the job and system."
540.0,Provider,"And also, I mean, I know that you had lost everything to the fire but knowing that there may be some relief programs out there to for like helping."
6108.0,Patient,"Even for like walking and looking into yeah. or some programs and the Community action will help us on that positive, they are going to help us with the propane situation I gotta hunt down the tank myself that. was hard, because I can't always be on the phone while, and you know that we're a bit and i'm usually always at work during the day, so I sometimes I forget I forget so much I can't believe the stuff I forget, and it will be so important to and. disagree train as it's taken me it's been praying for weeks now and i'm still throwing it up every week I I got the hang of the day, and then a mess, the time up and I was like oh man I get it right so it's really the switching on groups, I can. So and that's because you lost."
540.0,Provider,You lost your group right with Isaiah.
6108.0,Patient,You said yes.
540.0,Provider,"Is there, so what what time did they change it to for you."
6108.0,Patient,"It it went from Wednesday at two to Tuesday at noon and I keep getting it messed up. And I had it Wednesday at noon and then Tuesday to Thursday at two is when I tried to log in last time and, obviously, it was wrong time, I was so proud of a second yeah i'm i'm going to be in group today and. I was like man I can't. You know. never got the email. about my appointment, I actually remembered this appointment to be able to be here tonight."
540.0,Provider,So what see.
6108.0,Patient,"That, I have no clue on our next appointment is, and I know it's the 20 something minutes, probably a Monday i'm guessing not this coming Monday the following Monday design, thinking it is, and I think they're at the same time."
540.0,Provider,yeah I think we had that the same time just about you.
6108.0,Patient,"So I wanted to have such a hard time, remembering that. They see if they've."
540.0,Provider,"Put like any type of what your group assignment as. Okay, because I guess they have so they do have you in a care group right now to until you get with compliance. I think you have to do them and I was in compliance I literally like one whole week I was in."
6108.0,Patient,"compliance and then they switched groups on me and it messed me all up and I had to start over from scratch in and it's on, and I even like until now I forgot all about that character, I haven't been in that way. And it's it's a Friday morning at that and. I can't even remember remember and I don't know why I forget these things and or why I can't remember it."
540.0,Provider,Can. Can you put them in your like as a reoccurring things in your calendar.
6108.0,Patient,"Like on your own. I do it's just my phone I don't actually have service on it and, like, for my as my my calendar is rendering Google. So when i'm when I don't have any service my calendar don't really pick up and my son already has. For the day that you know if something's going on, or anything like like the one time I literally like made it all the way to the hour before you and I was to have our individual and like totally I don't know what happened that I missed the models went away and knew that I had it."
540.0,Provider,"So, so one thing I would suggest is maybe for our appointments maybe. If there's like a spot and like where you're staying I know that you're kind of bouncing right now. But if you can like put like a sticky note like on somewhere that that you can be like okay like i'm looking at it, but you may have to like tape a sticky note to the back of your phone of saying like group Tuesday 12pm. Friday and I what time is that."
6108.0,Patient,"Yes, I could ask them if there's another paragraph, that I can get into like one in the afternoon but. they're adamant I have to be in that one on Friday mornings."
540.0,Provider,"So all malware on here, maybe i'll see if they can contact you to go into a different care group. Let me put that in."
6108.0,Patient,Like right about 10 o'clock literally when we're usually all arriving at the shop and everybody's getting their assignments for the day and everything just. Between 10 and 12 is like on Friday on any day is like the busiest part of the day. For all of us. stop it. garage part. we're storing on bikes and everything at the new place.
540.0,Provider,"Oh, really. Oh you're there. Okay, oh that's huge yeah."
6108.0,Patient,This is just the garage part and like. All of our babies are there.
540.0,Provider,"Are you guys staying there, right now, even like."

6108.0,Patient,he's just too much.
540.0,Provider,Have you guys had any other like further. Talks or anything or.
6108.0,Patient,"No anytime anything's ever trying just it always usually somebody takes it the wrong way and it gets blown out of proportion, or something, and so I just keep my mouth shut. yeah I mean you don't."
540.0,Provider,You don't want to be in that type. environment with everything going on.
6108.0,Patient,we're trying really hard to get this place here done and especially with Pam and ricky. is trying to get it all done and sometimes I just I just wish I could just get off work and go home sometimes doesn't crash. Is that using stop stop it.

6108.0,Patient,"Oh, we have accounts are there."
540.0,Provider,Okay.
6108.0,Patient,"All right, yeah. Making decent money. Stop it stop."
540.0,Provider,"Well, my take that unfortunately you being in it right now but it's it's those humbling experiences as well that. just getting through them and knowing where it's going to lead."
6108.0,Patient,"yeah well and just having a place of our own that man, a goal in time is just it's a relief in itself, this is. rebuilding the wall over there. Now leave this area open toward like. A market, I guess, and be able to set up outside and stuff because it's a big all out sign. So you guys, so you guys are going to live in, like the garage area."
540.0,Provider,And then.
6108.0,Patient,"Well, no we're gonna we're going to stay over the area I was just showing you were saying I there where where that plastic was about turning Wall, we just built what I have a door put in and.

Many I don't have a phone myself, and then I have a fan, but I don't have a film with service or anything. Everything goes to his phone and he pays much attention to his messages really."

6108.0,Patient,"I always go for my email my email on. Everything for bright hard. Everything in there, my surveys and different folders and everything for each thing."
540.0,Provider,So I don't know if we had like an email. I don't know if we have like an email reminder saying about appointments. Because it says yeah it says that it's just been going to your. cell phone I don't know if we can make an email.
6108.0,Patient,that's probably oh. yeah.
540.0,Provider,"Because that's really how like this system goes, is it goes directly like with like care navigators contact you through email but phone is like the reminders for the. So I mean it's the same I believe it's the same number that should be contacting you for some maybe. If he could look and see if he can find like the messages and then maybe save that as like bright heart health."
6108.0,Patient,yeah.
540.0,Provider,"So that hopefully that can. Help like reminder wise. Okay. Alright, so i'll See you in two weeks Okay, but so that means I want food in between the holiday, so I hope that you have a good holiday enjoy your."

So she actually has made a step towards finding that place for residency so she is currently working on it with her significant other. And just building and being able to so they're actually living there on and off right now, along with staying with some of their family until it's ready so some steps towards that is going to be continuing to work on it, they try to work every day but. The end goal is for in the next three months to be completely moved in there with everything going so she has a few other steps to be doing, like the water heater and propane tank. So some things that she's working on every day towards that long term goal, so we want to note take everything that I just said short term goals still working on managing coping so she's working on that puzzle piece monkey so. If she can do that about two times a week that's a bit manageable for her. And then short term goals is trying to get her into compliance as well, so she has to be attending the care NAB i'm sorry care group I have put in a inquiry for them to be able to switch her time. i'm just because she isn't really able to do morning times with work. Other than that nothing for transcription."
