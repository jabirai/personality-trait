386.0,Provider,"Pam did you take it today already, though. yesterday. Was that morning or afternoon that you took it. You said you have one remaining top left. And for the buprenorphine no lock so and when was the last time you took that."
11739.0,Patient,This morning.
386.0,Provider,Do you have any remaining of that medication. And that was out of the last 14 prescribed. Are you currently experiencing any withdrawal symptoms.
11739.0,Patient,"No, not that I know."
386.0,Provider,"it's not it wouldn't be typical with you taking dosing this morning, but have to ask. Any recent relapses using any opioids or illicit substances at all."
11739.0,Patient,um I did relapse about a month or so ago Julie came in live on all know about it.
386.0,Provider,Go and what did you use at that time.
11739.0,Patient,On norco.
386.0,Provider,"alrighty reviewing your chart it looks like here I currently have you in our program for opioid use disorder and that could be the long term opioid use um. And I have you being seen on Tuesdays for weekly group group medication management appointments on every Tuesday. It looks like here you completed out all of your surveys, I have the PM to nine in the compliance video questionnaire scoring one four out of four with 100% accuracy for that, so thank you for that. Did you have any questions or concerns in regards of any of those surveys. No perfect and looks like here your care intensity is recommending that you have an individual therapy appointment twice a month, would you be able to get in touch with love wanted to be able to get that scheduled."
11739.0,Patient,yeah so they two times a month every month.
386.0,Provider,"So two times a month every month, so it's usually every other week is the way they schedule it out so. What I would do in this particular cases I would contact the compliance vc or the care navigation BC let them know that you need to get scheduled for individual therapy, because what it's doing right now is it is. altering your prescription recommendation and so and it's automated so it's our computer generated formatting and What it does is every time you. don't have that appointment it it counts negatively, in terms of your prescription recommendations so right now, as we stand. it's recommending that we reduce the prescription to a four day supply with a secondary bridge so additional refill On top of that, to get you over to your next appointment. And it'll continue to do that and it'll you know every the longer you go without individual therapy or with with missing any appointments. it'll keep going down so it'll move from a four day to a two day and then eventually the two day doesn't have any additional refills attached to it, you would actually have to be seen in order to be able to continue getting medications. You so and I don't want to freak you out that's just that's part of the program that's the way. It the computer it's it, but I mean it looks it looks like you've been on a pretty steady pace there's a lot of green on your chart it looks like everything you know, has been pretty consistent for you. And so I don't want you to get to a place where you weren't aware, so the best thing to do, which definitely schedule for individual therapy that secondary prescription recommendation just because of the missed appointment that no show you fell asleep with your kids. Understandable I got four, so I completely get that family time is important if obviously falling asleep is falling asleep, but if there's any unexpected. Situations situation where you're not going to be able to make your appointment then definitely just make sure you log in or call on and cancel the appointment prior to the start of the appointment at time and day. And it'll be counted it doesn't get counted negatively against you, or what it does, is it, it marks it out as just a cancellation versus a no show okay um let's take a look here. What i'll be able to do for you. Because your next appointment, I have is January 11 for group, and so what we'll do is we'll do a four day supply for both medications that clint as a pm. will be for a quantity of eight and the buprenorphine blocks will be for quantity of eight and then so you'll be able to pick up after I call the pharmacy you'll be able to pick up and. Hopefully, today, depending on you know Eastern save more pharmacy is the preferred pharmacy that I have for you is that correct."
11739.0,Patient,yeah they're awesome.
386.0,Provider,"So if they can get it filled for you today, you could pick up today, and then you would take medication, you would count today as medication taking so. Even though, you have the one left so you would still utilize what medication, you have on hand right now. versus don't over use the medication, because not that'll put you off track, but you can get medication filled and then it'll be good for four days so it'll be good for Wednesday, Thursday, Friday Saturday, and then you would need to pick up again on Sunday for that additional refill."
11739.0,Patient,Okay um they mentioned something about being me being able to join julie's group tomorrow with that fix it.
386.0,Provider,"That that would be something that Julie would be have to be able to override for you um I do know that Julie does except. Usually, as long as the groups aren't so crowded she does do make up groups for for missed appointments. But that's something that I would definitely if you are allowed to go into that group, then what I would recommend is discussing at that time of group saying. Right now, I have a prescription recommendation for four days supply is there any way that we can get that overrode it's all up to Julie canes determination, though. And July, so what typically happens for any type of override is the the prescribing physician for medication management and your individual therapist will group together have a discussion and then they'll come up with some type of determination on like you know we're a team so. We all work. cohesively um and so that would be up to your individual therapist and Julie. um, but I can definitely do the four day supply if that's something that you're meeting here, and then I again I have saved more Eastern save more pharmacy for you on Michigan avenue Is that correct."
11739.0,Patient,"Yes, ma'am."
386.0,Provider,You got it do you have any additional questions or concerns.
11739.0,Patient,"i'm, not that I can think of."
386.0,Provider,"Okay, what i'm going to be doing is i'm going to be calling over to eastern save more. I believe they're pretty quick on answering the phone system there, so what i'll do I have your phone number at 734-271-3069 Is that correct. Yes, so what i'll do is i'll send a text message out to you if that's okay just letting you know that the order has been completed and to contact the pharmacy within 30 to 45 minutes to confirm what time to pick up if that works for you."
11739.0,Patient,yeah that's fine.
