191.0,Provider,"there's, no, no, I was wrapping up what a patient. yeah but yeah the 15 minute appointments don't give us a lot of time, and so I like to do 30 minute appointments, but I know we're trying to see our patients, so we may move forward to that too Okay, so your therapist Stacey. And how's your sobriety going."
10125.0,Patient,"Well, it was going very well well, the main reason I started bright heart was for opiates. And i've done very well with that."
191.0,Provider,enabled I.
10125.0,Patient,"haven't done those in years and years. Like i've always felt that I was diagnosed with depression, when I was young, and I felt that that wasn't the correct. diagnosis, I felt like I was depressed due to it was like a symptom of. What I was experiencing in talking to my mom she said that they always felt that I was a dd or ADHD when I was younger and she showed me some paperwork where i've been tested. But she always felt that I was smart enough to skew the test, and then I went to a therapist that you see who also agreed with that and said that she didn't do that kind of testing and that I needed to get it done elsewhere. So I was doing tell him tell a medicine with another doctor Dr drew and she put me on like the first thing strattera really messed me up and now she has me on Prozac and. The other one for her, she said as a mild ADHD mad, which also is not doing well, she just upped it and I feel very. irrational and I had some things happen in my personal life and I relapsed that we could go on that. it's the G you a an ACI me is the medicine."
191.0,Provider,Wilson SWAT. team yeah. Okay.
10125.0,Patient,So I called stacie yesterday we had an appointment and I told her I relapse and because i've i've kind of been over the past month before I would.
191.0,Provider,read that song with math because.
10125.0,Patient,math.
191.0,Provider,Okay matt. How long have you been relapse.
10125.0,Patient,"Well, I was completely clean for a month, and you know, I was only doing matter of short time anyway, and it wasn't I didn't see it as a problem because I felt like I was just doing that to get my my mind, is just always such a mess and. I was actually lost my job because I couldn't keep my thoughts straight and. You know. I just can't seem to get it together with that and seems like the older I get and my kids get older it's harder and harder and. I tried math once and it just I was like it was like it answered everything, so I felt. I was self medicating with that obviously so Stacy and I work together we slowly got me off of it and I. didn't have a problem, but then. Starting these meds I felt so bad and. Then I had some things with my daughter, and I just I don't know what made me do it, but I did."
191.0,Provider,and using the crystal meth.
10125.0,Patient,um it was like I said just like. Just like months before all of months before I started putting so it wasn't long I wasn't doing it for very long. Okay hmm.
191.0,Provider,So it looks like you saw like therapist in my day.
10125.0,Patient,"All right, I let her know that I did it and she was like it's okay don't be so because I tried pretty hard because it's not even something that I see as a problem. But I do know that it helps me feel more together, but I know that's not good for me, and I want to get my meds right, you know."
191.0,Provider,"Right, no, I understand that and honestly moscoso. i've had patients that have Ashley self medicated with crystal meth or stimulants and they didn't notice the difference. Have you met with your mental health provider to let her know you failed treatment with this tutera she's tried the Wolfensohn, have you met with her to let her know how these medicines make you food."
10125.0,Patient,"Yes, and she just upped the dose That was the last of my solar. I haven't felt good but I don't see her again for she sees me like in two weeks again to evaluate and i'm aware there's always like a getting used to period, so I try to give it a chance you know. I really do try to work with it and."
191.0,Provider,So. So I can hear what you're saying so you feel treatment on to non stimulant. tight mitts for. ADHD ADHD correct. Okay ADHD. Has appointment. With thought site providers this a doctor.
10125.0,Patient,Yes.
191.0,Provider,"that's not a real. doctor lauren. Casey, I repeat, please."
10125.0,Patient,yeah it's la capital are you.
191.0,Provider,"Okay, in two weeks right."
10125.0,Patient,"yeah. Okay. Stacy said she couldn't believe she started me on that that's pretty. She said, you can tell, Dr cell and she'll probably say the same thing that's kind of an odd."
191.0,Provider,"You know person I you know. i've had people you know i'm aware of people that do well on the strict terrified ADHD more people are accustomed to the stimulants but there's been. A few people that have done well on it it's not uncommon. To start with a street Tara, especially if you're already on a controlled substance, some people often do that okay so um and yeah so when it. The way I practice is that if you already have someone working with you and they've got your diagnosis and they're trying to work with you go ahead and let you go ahead and try to work with them if that doesn't work out, then I definitely would need the medical records. So we can go ahead and request the medical records to confirm. diagnosis and treatment, whereas located. Is it. Is it in Ohio."
10125.0,Patient,"Okay, which organization."
191.0,Provider,I can look it up yeah. Let us know.
10125.0,Patient,I don't yeah.
191.0,Provider,"yeah so we. go that way. yeah because unfortunately sometimes clarissa some people don't want to add another stimulant if you're already on a soapbox on I don't feel that way. I just want to make certain that you have the appropriate Rourke up the appropriate treatment and and if you and Dr Laura has worked through this and if that's something you don't want to do. And I can confirm what she's done and feel like you've done a diagnosis and treatment, I don't have a problem with looking at a stimulant for treatment of ADHD. Because i've have seen how people. have benefited from it, and you know so that won't be a problem at all this Chris okay. But one thing I do."
10125.0,Patient,"That was the next step was what you would want to do next is put me on stimulants but if I did, that her visits wouldn't be covered by insurance, and it would be $250 a visit and you could."
191.0,Provider,kind of like.
10125.0,Patient,"i'm thinking is that. knows me I talked to her weekly I think that's probably going to be better anyway, because you know my background better I just feel like you talk to me, every day, every week and."
191.0,Provider,"i'm still. With her yeah so yeah learning, but I don't know you know me more than she. Does is like i've seen right yeah we get to see you more often. Oh."
10125.0,Patient,yay and I have one thing I want to share.
191.0,Provider,"Okay, one thing I do share with people. I do not start a stimulant unless I know that I can do it safely So what are the things that I do Okay, I need to have blood pressure. heart rate. Okay, I need normal. urine drug screens. Okay, I need to make certain. That you're stable. and doing well on butte okay so let's say if a person is relapse no crystal meth because there's some medication and you add an adderall this to stimulants adding those sorts of things and your risk of congestive heart failure or heart attack so. The thing is this. You know, have to work closely with you and your therapists have to make certain that we can do that and do that safely because. At bright health and most important things that you're safe that's interesting I don't have your results from 10 1210 2021 so I need to they need to put that in that you did your part, but there no I don't have your results are not in here. So let me get the results and I need the definitely monthly urine drug screens and everything so yeah I see what you did what you needed to do but. yeah okay."
10125.0,Patient,I will make sure that I get to the clean drug screen.
191.0,Provider,And then I will make.
10125.0,Patient,"Sure, I."
191.0,Provider,And I need.
10125.0,Patient,"To and everything yeah okay that's a good do you have an email, I can send this to you."
191.0,Provider,"Oh, I just have you go ahead and go through the virtual clinic yeah so I work through with them and then they upload it so yeah so. You can move this forward miss chorus and i'll be more than happy. Stacy and I like we're in a group, we really need the record from Dr uluru. To just confirm the diagnosis and the medications that were started and I like for people to have a blood pressure cuff, and actually watch you take your blood pressure. On normal urine drug screen I have and what we can do, and remind me, we can request the like in person lab needs to be done in 48 hours okay. So we'll need to move forward on that in. So, yes we'll be happy to work. with you on that okay okay. All right. Thank you, I appreciate it oh you work i'm let me ask you this because we always ask about it, because you are a young woman. know what i'm getting rid of as 42 years young What was your last Mr period, what are you doing for birth control."
10125.0,Patient,"I actually had the SURE and plan, and then I had to get a hysterectomy because of. That okay."
191.0,Provider,"So, how did I. Did the East your calls that did it cause you some problems."
10125.0,Patient,"It did yes. It was copper. That they put in there and it caused scarring and that's what it's. supposed to do, but it also caused a bunch of other medical problems with myself and thousands of other women."
191.0,Provider,out ahead nolan I thought ahead and nickel.
10125.0,Patient,"Nickel. Nickel yeah and it was taken off the market and I had to get my tubes. removed because it was part of my anatomy at that point. to know pelvic pain and. Okay, did you ever have."
191.0,Provider,"A bad, but I did."
10125.0,Patient,"I tasted metal I had extreme pelvic pain now. There was just all kinds of weird. weird symptoms that you wouldn't even think were caused by that, but it was. It it really messed my life up for a while. i'm sorry to hear that. But i'm glad you yeah."
191.0,Provider,"Did you kind of figured it out, do you feel better now that you've had hysterectomies."
10125.0,Patient,"A little bit, but I still have. pain and you know once in a while, but this was like debilitating pain it's not. it's not nearly like that now and. The metal taste this. and myself, some. Problems with like my joints and stuff which. is nice I that. I just think it's going to be there it's just going to be the way it is I learned, you know, instead of research things before you."
191.0,Provider,Research you so much.
10125.0,Patient,Okay.
191.0,Provider,"All right, thank you for sharing it now let's let's make certain let's set a time frame of when we need to do stuff."

191.0,Provider,Mental health okay one minute. 30 minutes. In January. The first or second week okay.
10125.0,Patient,Now.
191.0,Provider,"you're probably going to have to interact very closely with our care navigator and. That other organization and make certain we can get medical records and things from them, because sometimes it takes a long time for people to send that. Go ahead and get like a blood pressure, monitor if you're able to because periodically we're going to. check sometimes families make. You do it make blood pressure, go up and heart rate go up and then, if you're still young, but we want to make certain that we're not increasing your risk of heart attacks and strokes. That the stimulant don't cost Okay, so we have to proceed safely."
10125.0,Patient,And we'll keep getting the screens.
191.0,Provider,"Are you welcome, and so the main thing is the medical records, a lot of that may not be under our control this person, but we let's start early okay. Getting those medical records so you'll have to sign a release of information to to get that information okay so medical records you already have a blood. Pressure cuff, so what I usually do is. have my patients put it on their arm and at least once a month we check the blood pressure and I want you to check randomly anyway, once a week okay to make certain that you're safe. And then getting those urine drug screens and then you Stacy and I can touch base so this meeting is moving us forward okay."
