10190.0,Patient,hi. How are you.
252.0,Provider,How are you.
10190.0,Patient,Good. You know the ups and downs i'm on enough right now.
252.0,Provider,awesome that's good. How was the last couple weeks.
10190.0,Patient,"A couple weeks hard, the last like four days easy. Doing i've been doing really good. really trying to just. Not dive into. changes and goals obsessively and then get burned out on them. and I don't know I saw something on the Internet somewhere about. daily routine APP and it's called fabulous. hmm and have you heard of it."
252.0,Provider,mm hmm.
10190.0,Patient,"it's really nice it just um I don't know they do some kind of crazy reverse psychology in it, and I know exactly what they're doing they're like are you can drink water in the morning and then it gives you a. chance to answer is, you know you can say yes or you can say I don't want to commit to this yet. it's nice to give us the freedom, if you select you don't want to commit to it, yet they don't tell you about it. yeah you know, but you could always go back and click a button yes i'll do this. Anyway, but the first day of. Creating a routine it just my first goal was to just drink water first thing in the morning at least three times in a week that's it or whatever week if it goes like last week I started this, but so just reading quarter three times that's it. So I did that I I set up the APP and for the first, like several days I didn't really look at it, I just I don't know I just got that thing in my head that you know if I don't really start changing now it's in a few years it's about to get really hard. Like i'm just i'm just wasting time. and I don't know I get it, and then added something else, and then I get that and I I ended up adding a few of the necessary morning things like kick my medicine and. feeding the creatures and then today after I completed all my morning stuff it was like hey good job and then it gave me this whole spiel about adding exercise to my morning routine. Now it's like Okay, and the goal was only like seven minutes, but like. I just wanted to go for a long walk and the opposite, that was fine like you do whatever you want for the exercise but, like the minimum was do something. For seven minutes dance to some songs or you know anything. And I took the dog and I went for like a 35 minute walk and it was really nice. Good and I did all of this before the bullies woke up."
252.0,Provider,Are you kidding me. that's amazing.
10190.0,Patient,"Oh, it was great I didn't even have coffee this morning and after I had water into my medicine and went for the walk oh oh I forgot the second goal was breakfast. mm hmm in my morning routine, no matter what, even if i'm not hungry like have something for breakfast. gives easy suggestions like just grab a banana if you're in a hurry a handful of nuts, a protein bar, you know. yeah it just makes it seem doable and I don't know I just like today, I just had so much energy it felt really good. And I really hope I can stick to this because well I can't make my hair go like that it just."
252.0,Provider,You.
10190.0,Patient,know it just it feels good and I got the afternoon grogginess and I just had a cup of coffee and always well you know no I don't have coffee and tea. Green tea today it doesn't matter I had some kind of caffeine boost.
252.0,Provider,Well that's okay.
10190.0,Patient,"But then always okay. i'm still awake i'm not feeling groggy. Yesterday, last night I actually sat there and did like a half an hour of a puzzle. which was good. Did yeah I love puzzles and this morning I started reading my the chapter, I need for this week for school. and I don't know it's just like little differences like that, like I just kind of want to do these things now my mind, is more focused."
252.0,Provider,That.
10190.0,Patient,"i've been playing games. Online with my friends more often. For a while there I hadn't talked to them in like three months, you know and then. know you stop it's a dog like you stop know. down. Down i'm still getting each other dogs in the word. is about six months seven months now. is needed to be so cute."
252.0,Provider,"I know it's kind of like. A chicken, you know a little baby is so cute and then they go through. That stage."

252.0,Provider,So you've put you've implemented all of these positive changes and you're feeling the effects of them.
10190.0,Patient,Okay.
252.0,Provider,it's pretty freaking amazing.
10190.0,Patient,"yeah yeah it's I don't know. I don't want to Oh, the cats back right he's knocked out again he open the screen door by yourself, I guess, he wants to come back in now oh Is that why the other dog was barking at you, where you got to get eaten by a righty. or neighbor has a big oil or eat the cat but he keeps sneaking out so there's not much I can do about that."
252.0,Provider,So.
10190.0,Patient,yeah he's an asshole he really is. If I don't let them outside if I physically stop him from going out. He looks at me and go away or Sydney and then i'll find pete. pete on my clothes are on my bed or something.
252.0,Provider,Oh. To love that.
10190.0,Patient,he's an asshole. So what i'm going to do.
252.0,Provider,And now you're you're going to love them through it right till he gets old enough to know he's not supposed to do it.
10190.0,Patient,"he's a little over a year now, I think he knows. Always coincides with when I physically stopped him from going outside. Every single time then i'll find something feed on."
252.0,Provider,Okay.
10190.0,Patient,he's mean but what's funny is he's the most cuddly thing ever feel come up to you and cuddle you and love you and Pearl over you rub against your face.
252.0,Provider,Oh.
10190.0,Patient,yeah.
252.0,Provider,But he's got that other side to. that's so funny it's just like.
10190.0,Patient,"he's a Pope. So yeah I. I know really i'm afraid that if I get too excited about my progress i'm going to just kind of fall off the wagon again and I don't want to I really like how this is making me feel and. But I know how I am like I stick to something maybe i'll do it for a month or so and then i'll have one day, where I don't do it, and then i'm like I don't feel like doing this anymore."
252.0,Provider,yeah it's important that you figure out right because you know you better than anybody it's important to figure out why you're on this journey what works for you. And what doesn't right.
10190.0,Patient,mm hmm.
252.0,Provider,what's going to keep you motivated to continue on this journey that you're on because whatever you do we use working. Right.
10190.0,Patient,"It has it has working. I can't remember the amount of energy i've had it at this time I mean usually, the first thing I want to do after I put the baby done asleep the smoker point which I still might tonight, but i'm. A maybe it had something to do with I had I put him down right before I got online for the appointment. I don't know I just don't feel that that need. I still might just because it's nighttime. I don't know it's like having a glass of wine at night for me. You know."
252.0,Provider,"it's like that, for a lot of people, you know."
10190.0,Patient,"I still think I want to stop during the day, which I have mostly during this like upswing them having. yeah except i'll smoke a little during his nap time which is just like. Usually 12 or one o'clock normally sleeps for like an hour to now, unfortunately. For us to nap I used to put them down at one and he'd wake up at like five. o'clock. Not anymore."
252.0,Provider,"That is just something else on kids they change their time the older they get their time it's different, we have to adjust to them, you know."
10190.0,Patient,"In every time i'm reaching that phase where his nap times are shrinking or like before, when we were going down to three NAPs a day that two NAPs a day that wouldn't have a good. Time oh it's like oh no what am I going to do without that extra time to myself, and then we just deal with it."
252.0,Provider,"just deal with it that's what we have to do we find time for ourselves, and those little bit of NAPs and those little bit of. times and after sleep. Right when it's bedtime."
10190.0,Patient,For when it.
252.0,Provider,"comes home, you know."
10190.0,Patient,"yeah and this APP really hit close to home, for me, because at some point it. It has like these little video snippets and when you first sign up it tells you about all these famous people like Michelle Obama and everyone. Why they're mentally healthy and they said all of these people go to bed at the same time wake up, at the same time and do the same exact thing every single morning. and I don't know and then it another point it told me. something about moms needing to complete their morning routine before anyone else wakes up. And that's what I did today I made sure it was all done before I saw either of the boys my gift the baby with ruben was still in bed when I got up and if the baby woke up you know, whatever he's there they he can handle it. Right i'm doing me right now."
252.0,Provider,And look at the outcome.
10190.0,Patient,You know you feel good.
252.0,Provider,"motivation comes after behaviors, that is what i'm learning right we don't have to be motivated to do something we just have to get up and do it, and then they meet. them right. Especially when you're feeling the effects right and pre planning, when you get to that point where you start getting bored with the routine oh sorry."
10190.0,Patient,"that's Okay, I know how it feels."
252.0,Provider,"You know, trying to figure out things that you could possibly in from implement later on down the road. You know, to me. And just kind of putting it aside and then."
10190.0,Patient,"i'm going to get bored with this for a while, because right now it's just telling me to do my morning routine in it to adding something every time I complete. The new goal like three times add something else, like today was exercise now after complete that for three days, and when I do exercise for three days it'll add something else, but then after I fit my morning routine up it's done has afternoon routine evening routine. I think it'll keep me busy for a minute."
252.0,Provider,Okay okay. Just tell me if you start getting that feeling.
10190.0,Patient,"That, I want to quit."
252.0,Provider,"yeah and we'll you know we'll throw something in there, that will bring back and revamp excited miss of it all, you know."
10190.0,Patient,I might need that extra support only been at this for like a week so. it's still going strong for now.
252.0,Provider,But i'll tell you what the difference is amazing. You know that the difference is amazing to turn on zoom and there be a smile right.
10190.0,Patient,It doesn't always happen.
252.0,Provider,No it's good to see you know. So you can say it's working you feel good. And that's important and that's all you need right now.
10190.0,Patient,Just gotta capitalize on that field goodness yeah.
252.0,Provider,"yeah. that's, the most important part of it all, you know, is he going. keep you going."
10190.0,Patient,"Yes, it's i'm just kind of amazed at just how much natural energy I got like I actually went to the store today haven't done that in a while, with just me in the baby. Yes, let me tell you he's a. handful. The source, especially today, but like I just dealt with it, it was fine. He threw himself on the floor screaming when I was looking for a mattress protector. Like okay you do that i'm gonna do me over here, let me know when you're done. Oh, oh my gosh I have to tell you what happened at home goods so graph we found this train set this Melissa and Doug trains that he actually has one in the garage so I didn't want to buy it but. He wanted to play with it right there and I said well how about how about we pay for it take it home and then he can play for it, but I knew he'd be bored with it, by the time I was done shopping. So, or he wants something else instead. So he I let him play with it on the floor just for a minute he just wanted to scoot it in the box go to true true true. And then, after a couple minutes I said Okay, well, we really have to finish our shopping no and I said we'll just put it in the basket for later so put it in the basket. And he throws a fit like he gets so mad he just starts wailing tears streaming down his cheeks because he wants it right now. i'm holding his hand he's trying to pull away from. around the corner. single guy victory. He looks at me he points to me, and he just yells looks at the man points to me and your strength tells on me. letting me have the train. and whatever his languages, but. Listen man, I mean like we just died laughing it was so. And when he left. darcy double down he pointing at me. Like he was good this guy was gonna do something about it."
252.0,Provider,you're bigger than her.
10190.0,Patient,"help me mommy won't let me have to train you gotta do something, this is child abuse."
252.0,Provider,is so funny.
10190.0,Patient,he's always they are.
252.0,Provider,Now is that was the best thing that have been.
10190.0,Patient,laughing so for these people over here. screaming just laughing.
252.0,Provider,Where. As part.
10190.0,Patient,"Of the time we got to the register he got two boys and when I get to the register, as we have to pick one one was the train and one was a. piano both he wanted it so bad at some point, and asked me to pick one. And he said all done he didn't want either of them and then he points to the candy and said he wanted that and I said well that's not a choice whether this one or this one he didn't want them so when he put them, but we let the cashier take them walked out with zero toys. And here okay Andy."
252.0,Provider,it's enough money.
10190.0,Patient,He wasn't even mad about the candy in the toys Lee just worked out perfectly fine.
252.0,Provider,"Oh, my God."
10190.0,Patient,it's such a big deal.
252.0,Provider,This is crazy kids are just you know they're learning. holy cow they're amazing to me.
10190.0,Patient,boy.
252.0,Provider,"I fibro granddaughter she's a shopper. And I had to do the same thing to her whoa take one. This one of these, but I want this, and this, and this, and this no. Take one, and that was it was like torture for her."
10190.0,Patient,mm hmm.
252.0,Provider,And how dare I put a limit.
10190.0,Patient,How dare.
252.0,Provider,You.
10190.0,Patient,How is she supposed to choose. choosing between life and death.
252.0,Provider,"Yes, she's a little drama queen too, so it worked out and she chose one, but then she came right home and told her mom. dad wouldn't let me have what I wanted. To that, and so the next time she wanted to go to the store with me, I said nope you can't go I don't want to be the main name anymore."
10190.0,Patient,So you go the sub over.
252.0,Provider,And she was just like. Dear you.
10190.0,Patient,So offended.
252.0,Provider,"yeah we go through her battles, but she said, some of the craziest things kids do some of the craziest things."
10190.0,Patient,know they do.
252.0,Provider,You know. Out of mouth mouths of babes man.
10190.0,Patient,"i'm trying to. i'm taking my speech therapy early intervention approach to teaching rafi to pick up his toys and everything so each of his toy sets are in ziploc bags and he has to. Take a bag that he wants to play with he can open it play with it, when he wants something else he has to put it away and then he goes and gets another back right and. My mother in law taught me all this you speech therapists early intervention so i'm. I asked her well, what do I do all of his toys are in his room he's just going to when I start this he's just going to take them all out overnight. And I teach him not to do that she said when I go in there just say, oh no your toys are all over, we have to clean up everything. shut the door behind me, and everything has to be picked up before we can leave this worked for like the first couple days, he was totally fine picking up his toys. And then, today this morning he had open two bags, which contained a lot of little wood blocks for them all over the room and. He was crying picking up about three quarters of them, but then he just got mad like he was getting so frustrated he didn't want to pick up anymore, he wanted to eat he wanted to go out of the room, if you wanted to go outside anything but pick up these last. Few toys. Until we just sat there he cried and then he laid on the floor many hug the stuffed animal up like 30 minutes later hands up picking up some toys. So I think we might be having a breakthrough. yeah with with."
252.0,Provider,"you're not giving in, you know."
10190.0,Patient,"Well it's fine for me I just sit there on the floor and watch him. And I mean I helped him pick up his toys, too, but I won't do it if he's not doing it. Right yeah."
252.0,Provider,"I think you know because I was always the mom that did it for them. Yes, worst thing ever worst thing ever. Was was."
10190.0,Patient,"done, I did that, for a while it was either well I didn't really I just kind of let him have his toys all over the House. mm hmm I only started this this week."
252.0,Provider,"it's a new beginning better for both of you, though. that's the great part about it, and you know staying strong through it and not giving into fits and you know that's what."
10190.0,Patient,He doesn't know how stubborn I am he does it for me. He can beat me.
252.0,Provider,that's so funny. it's funny but what a great idea.
10190.0,Patient,yeah it seems to be working really well that's how she hold on her therapy sessions like she's got a box of bags of different plays and they have to knock knock knock open the box and then they get to pick which one they want to play it.
252.0,Provider,mm hmm.
10190.0,Patient,And then she closes the box. it's a good strategy.
252.0,Provider,That is a great idea. I my my granddaughter.
10190.0,Patient,You should it's great I swear by it.
252.0,Provider,"that's what i'm going to do, because you know struggling with them picking up out for themselves. But this might be a way to make it work right. If it's working on your little tot is going to work on a five."
10190.0,Patient,"Oh, I have to cuz I mean they don't have a choice right first thing in the morning, they want to come out of their room, they want to eat, they want to play, they want to do all of this, so just don't want them come out of the room, I mean go in there with her and show her what to do, but. She doesn't get to leave and do it, or even eat breakfast until they're cleaned up same thing we're capcom I go in there after naptime their toys all over we've got to clean them up. So. Pretty amazing yeah I can't believe it's working."
252.0,Provider,As an awesome practice.
10190.0,Patient,"You know, like a magic trick."
252.0,Provider,Because you know when you do it for them always what happens is when you teach this what I learned the hard way is that you wind up getting older children that don't know life skills don't know how to do things on their own.
10190.0,Patient,Just by me.
252.0,Provider,"You know, like you."
10190.0,Patient,"it's true, though I didn't learn. Any of this self care stuff I mean you know how to use the owner, when I was a teenager didn't know how to cut me with a knife didn't know how to do chores you know it, it affected me I didn't even know I didn't even have the habit of brushing my teeth. It seriously affected me."
252.0,Provider,"it's important. it's important that the skills are developed, you know. And is it when they're not. That I got it yeah. I see the outcome, I have a 3032 year old and through his teenage years he was ice calm Linus."
10190.0,Patient,From peanuts.
252.0,Provider,"As he was my lines. You know, but. He was my last biological so of course i'm going to pick everything up after an event in you know 1112 years old i'm going in his room and cleaning up. So what i've created is something I didn't want to create, which was a bigger mess and somebody with no life skills. Right and so, but my oldest kid I did the complete opposite she was doing chores at seven her room was clean all the time, show to make a."
10190.0,Patient,bow.
252.0,Provider,"You know she was a girl, he was a baby boy, and he was my last. But I watched the difference, you know at the difference, how they are today to. You know her house is clean she keeps up with everything right okay. Where my son he's just a hot mess, you can pick up a pair of pants or a sock to you know, save his life, and that was my creation from my parenting you know."
10190.0,Patient,yeah.
252.0,Provider,"We kind of joke about it now, and you know, the other day I told them do you need me to teach that skill now."
10190.0,Patient,yeah.
252.0,Provider,"I mean we we make jokes about it, but you really think about how we develop them when they're younger really plays on how they're going to be when our old."
10190.0,Patient,yeah sure does.
252.0,Provider,amazing remember to to to get really good life skills.
10190.0,Patient,"I hope so that's my goal, I would just want to make him better than me and then I will be successful."
252.0,Provider,"yeah. Definitely sounds like this week, everything is really going smoothly. going smoothly, with the baby going smoothly with you and where you're working on, I mean it's really good."
10190.0,Patient,"Oh, and here are double ear infection and a perforated your gym all weekend so. Oh last week yeah he's getting better now amoxicillin but he's uh. he's going great now. That whole thing he was feeling awful."
252.0,Provider,And through that you're still able to do what you needed to do for you.
10190.0,Patient,"I can be strong, sometimes."
252.0,Provider,Yes.
10190.0,Patient,it's just it's really weird like the hardest things i've been through like i'm strong I can power through right and then it's just these little things that I just let kind of fall to the side you know.
252.0,Provider,"yep you remember, though, that when you let one thing fall to the side, then that's when you know, the foundation that you're trying to build falls down."
10190.0,Patient,So you can go rosen process slide right.
252.0,Provider,"So you want to keep that one thing that you know, maybe you're tired of doing or. you're getting bored with or you just don't want to do it you've got to keep doing it, even when you don't want to you know attend, you can poopy diaper likes to change poopy diapers."
10190.0,Patient,Especially dafis.
252.0,Provider,"who likes to change, but we do it because we have to. write with."
10190.0,Patient,"That since he's our boy, we made him it's our responsibility."
252.0,Provider,Right. So trying to put your mind in the same concept. You know it's your responsibility to take care of you.
10190.0,Patient,"Because I think now the hardest thing about it to another hard thing about is the codependence and very codependent. And for a long time i've been stuck on this, I need my husband to do these things with me and need him to do it with me I want him to go on walks with me every day I want him to meditate with me I want them to have breakfast with me, you know. and I mean. Our most successful time losing weight was when we're just counting calories which is fine, we know that's what works just counting calories but. Instead of trying to eat the same things we just ate whatever we wanted. You know. He wanted Chinese or something he kind of salaries, I wanted a sandwich you know same thing and we lost 20 pounds each. i'm. gonna have to be safe for this and i've been encouraging him to. There we go i've been encouraging him to start the APP to the same one and I said you pick your path with it, you pick your morning routine your stuff this this is working, it is working and so he actually just started it today, he had his first glass of water, when he woke up today."
252.0,Provider,And he's not gonna be the same tomorrow.
10190.0,Patient,and the next day and then yeah.
252.0,Provider,That was his own journey.
10190.0,Patient,he's like a week behind me but that's okay eventually we'll get to that point and. it'll all add up.
252.0,Provider,"You know that's pretty amazing and I don't think that that that is. it's more dependency what you were talking about, but this I don't think is. No, this is is more supporting one another, while you're learning how to do different things and get healthier."
10190.0,Patient,"yeah it's been hard to get to that point, though."
252.0,Provider,yeah this.
10190.0,Patient,is a good thing. It is a good thing and it's very important for me to be able to get up and do it by myself.
252.0,Provider,mm hmm but it sure is nice to know he's a week behind it. Right and that.
10190.0,Patient,I help you figure good.
252.0,Provider,"motivation more. mm hmm right. No, I don't think that that's that falls in the category of dependency or codependency I think it really is motivation."
10190.0,Patient,yea graduated.
252.0,Provider,"Very much so very much so, and knowing that you that you really have to do this, you know your part, your stuff on your own. That shows independence and wanting to get better for you, that doesn't show codependency either. there's one point that out."
10190.0,Patient,Oh it's scary. scary. it's scary. I mean i've always been so independent I just. I don't know. Just need that accountability buddy I guess.
252.0,Provider,"And that's okay. that's all right there's nothing wrong with having an accountability partner. I don't, especially when you see see it working, not just for you, but then, as you start seeing it and feeling of working for them to. that drives that motivation, they continue on."
10190.0,Patient,yeah. It sure does doesn't it.
252.0,Provider,yeah it does yes.
10190.0,Patient,"I have to change this year ruben and I decided, or rather I pushed him to do. My best friend just had a baby and it's caused my uterus to start screaming because i've been with her, like every step of the way through the pregnancy, since she got pregnant down, she said her baby babies like a week old now. And she's so cute she's so adorable so I started talking to realize that I think we need to have another. And he was freaking out and he's like oh hell no we're not having another and I after like a week of this, I told them like you don't think I mean right now right, I said in like a year, let her happy start kindergarten or something so even in school full time. yeah can take a year to take care of ourselves lose weight improve our mental health. And then, a year from now start trying. I think will be in a much better position. it'll be easier."
