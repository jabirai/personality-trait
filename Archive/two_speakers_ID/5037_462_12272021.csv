5037.0,Patient,prayer.
462.0,Provider,"yeah. Alright, so what is your day to day been looking like lately, as far as just your routine."
5037.0,Patient,yeah it's because there's no school right now we're on break. get up. and get yourself ready and for the day and then. Watch some TV or something and then his kids get to make him the breakfast or whatever. i'm not a lot going on during the days here. Then we just clean the House and it's pretty much the same every day.
462.0,Provider,"And is there anything you think you could add to your routine that would help with the stress and anxiety, I know, like you said you have a good prayer routine but anything else that comes to mind."
5037.0,Patient,yeah hanging out with my best friend.
462.0,Provider,yeah.
5037.0,Patient,"That helps a lot. it's a it's kind of a loneliness thing in this weird. To be in a house where they are six people and billowing. You know that's it's hard to pull off, but. One and just as an example and. The large two story home and all the bedrooms except mine are upstairs. Mines downstairs. So when they go to bed at nine o'clock at night, everybody goes upstairs and i'm left there by myself. So there's a little bit, but except separation anxiety, but. it's just it's the weather to it's a doom and gloom grey sky you know crappy not a lot of sunshine and so there's that too."
462.0,Provider,"yeah Those are two really good point so you can kind of see how the weather impacts you and that's very common that. Just constant Gray, can be really tough, as well as feeling lonely despite being in a packed House. But, as you said, you're a little bit separate and they all go their way at night and you're kind of left there, so what kind of things do you. Do at the end of the day, on. About reading or any other."
5037.0,Patient,"Practices yeah mostly TV at the end of the day. i've already done my reading, you know up to that point. just moved to London to bed."
462.0,Provider,Okay yeah and then it sounds like it's really important piece here is just getting together with your best friend and having that social connection.
5037.0,Patient,um man you're not kidding it really helps.
462.0,Provider,yeah do you have any plans to meet up with them anytime soon.
5037.0,Patient,yeah i'm going over there and go.
462.0,Provider,Perfect okay. i'm glad to hear that so you're kind of directly. Recognizing hey this helps a lot let's do it.
5037.0,Patient,"yeah yeah. And we're very much like our birthdays are three days apart. he's the first time, the fourth and so. yeah we've we've been geez 42 years. that's a long time long time yeah I met him when I was 19."
462.0,Provider,So it sounds like you feel very connected and supported by him. And that is something you need right now.
5037.0,Patient,"yep, and this is Lola."

5037.0,Patient,that's Lola.

462.0,Provider,How are your grandkids I know one of those working their way through high school and athletically gifted.
5037.0,Patient,"huh yep still same he's still conditioning and training for track track starts. Think, the third week of January. So he's running track. Again, which is good. But yeah and then. my granddaughter that lives here she's a softball player and she just ended her her season, about two weeks ago. And then there's the little guy he's into everything."
462.0,Provider,will go to place that you're they're able to spend so much time with them and support them to.
5037.0,Patient,yeah it's really. That really helps a lot yeah.
462.0,Provider,"Okay well good, so it sounds like things are fairly steady around your House for a while, I know, there was coded and that caused a lot of stress and, of course, the holidays cause stress too, but you're. you're studying you're coping and that you kind of know what works for you pray you kind of get through your routine each day rely on some social support so. What would you say are just some of the goals and some of the things you're working on, or would like to work on the most right now."
5037.0,Patient,"hmm. well. there's and played work on. That just. Work on my communications skills, a little bit so that people know how I feel and where I stand on any particular subject. And i'm just talking about within the family here. Sure um. that's one thing I can think of."
462.0,Provider,US can. do that.
5037.0,Patient,"i'm. just getting more engaged on a one on one type thing with. whomever that may be. Not an issue what. If something needs to be talked about, or something I don't know I don't know how to put it into words what i'm trying to get out. Okay."
462.0,Provider,"So that's something you can think about it sounds like, as you said, connecting one on one is a good start."
5037.0,Patient,yeah.
462.0,Provider,"Sometimes, it can be easier to communicate well just in that one on one basis versus to kind of a whole group of people, it can get a. Little muddy."
5037.0,Patient,yeah.
462.0,Provider,"that's a good start, so that can be a goal that we put down that you continue to work on. Right. Anything else."
5037.0,Patient,"yeah there's plenty to work on i'm. Just continuing to work on my awareness. and circumstances in the House, in other words, pay more attention to me where i'm doing me something i'm giving off a bad fiber. i'm go in somehow shutting people out or I don't know but kind of look at myself more."
462.0,Provider,"So, developing a little bit of self."
5037.0,Patient,Awareness more someone's.
462.0,Provider,"Right yeah that sounds like a good goal is there, something that kind of sparked that thought."
5037.0,Patient,i'm not any one thing I can think of. As a good example. I can't come up on.
462.0,Provider,Just something you feel like you need to work on.
5037.0,Patient,yeah I think so.
462.0,Provider,"Right so communication and then self awareness that sounds like a really good place to start. And then, as far as just your progress in the program so you've been in the program almost exactly one year, how are you feeling about your pain management, the group's individual therapy."
5037.0,Patient,"and so forth yeah it's always good I like the Groups, I, like my my time with you as well. and The medicines helps. yeah some days I can skip it I got it and take one all day yesterday. Okay, so. everything's. on track in that sense. The medication, but yeah it's been good groups and everything is song help."
462.0,Provider,"Okay, all right good i'm glad to hear that so since you've been in the program for quite a while now, and you kind of melted into the group. What we typically do is have you go, so you were. Doing twice a month. once a month now, we can bring you down to a quarterly so you'll meet with me only once every quarter and we can kind of just really check in at that point, keep setting goals and seeing how they're going rather than monthly, what do you think about that idea."
5037.0,Patient,And that's fine.
462.0,Provider,"Okay alright so then how about we schedule you for quarterly or for your next quarter is a little far out, so I will try to give you a reminder, but I asked you try to put in your calendar. as well. i'll be in April. let's see what we can do here too. So. Maybe Monday April."
5037.0,Patient,25 25. Okay.
462.0,Provider,yeah we can put you in for 12 o'clock since that's kind of been the consistent thing so April 25 Monday at 12 o'clock.
5037.0,Patient,"yeah. I don't know how to say this, there are some things I don't discuss with you. And just because I think it's. Personal more personal to me. So. it's been really tough. But. I suppose if if we need if I need to talk to you sooner, I can reach out."
462.0,Provider,"Absolutely yeah anytime that you feel like you need some more support, you can just let me know. Of course therapy is to discuss personal things, but if you're not comfortable discussing that's understandable to. Also, you could find an outside therapist if you wanted. I don't know sometimes people there's a gender thing if you wanted like a male therapist or we could even talk about switching to."
5037.0,Patient,yeah not that's not me.
462.0,Provider,"Okay, so absolutely anytime you needed more support, you can just email or text me on that number and. We can book a session I usually have some space on Monday so yeah just feel free so whatever it is that's going on that's tough i'll just ask you what is the best thing that you can do to help yourself through it right now."
5037.0,Patient,"Well i'm i'm been working on that for a while and. Something needs to change here. And it's. within the family dynamic. But. it's yeah it's family, his family so."
462.0,Provider,"yeah yeah it can be really hard to cope with family stuff and not everybody agrees so. yeah important to, as you said, work on that communication and try to communicate as clearly as possible and set boundaries and also just do your own self care right so get out of the House get with your best friend and. Any way that you can keep yourself going and healthy and other ways is is important during during times like that. yeah so feel free again. If you need to book another appointment to just messaged me. And then i'm just looking at your profile so i'm changing it to quarterly for individual and saving that. And then I see that there's a physical health survey that needs to be complete."
5037.0,Patient,"I did, that I did all my surveys yesterday."
462.0,Provider,"Okay, then it probably just didn't go through yet. Let me just see if there's anything else that sticks out. looks like you had an."
5037.0,Patient,Appointment on the 17th.
462.0,Provider,That you missed.
5037.0,Patient,that's the one that Dr Jackson was talking about last last meeting. Was I can choose to do it or not. it's up to me. And I just I just didn't reschedule.
462.0,Provider,"Okay yeah if you choose to reschedule it's you know you know how to do that, but otherwise everything else looks pretty good so. If there's nothing else I can support you with today, then I will be seeing you in group, and I will be seeing you for our quarterly session, unless you feel like you're ready to talk about some of that personal stuff or need further support."
5037.0,Patient,Okay that'd be good.
462.0,Provider,All right.
5037.0,Patient,"Our group is um yeah the group is. Not this Thursday, or is it. I think it is right."
462.0,Provider,"Let me take a look, sometimes forget myself. looks like it's this Thursday yeah we did not have it last Thursday. Okay, so I will see you on Thursday."
5037.0,Patient,"Okay, thank you."
462.0,Provider,"All right, take care."
5037.0,Patient,"All right, bye bye."
462.0,Provider,"All right, in the patients treatment plan section, can you please put his quarterly goals as the two things he stated, which was communication and self awareness, you could be that uses own words. In that area, and if you could just note in the note that he went down to quarterly sessions, thank you."
