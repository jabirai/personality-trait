14334.0,Patient,"I do feel that there's like a euphoria, with it, but i'm mostly tired. So, like basically it's like if I took nyquil and I was forced to stay awake. yeah. Oh, I feel."
298.0,Provider,"Oh, my goodness that's craziness I would hate that."
14334.0,Patient,I was very active four year old I can't keep up with him when I feel like that.

14334.0,Patient,"manny and I had talked about maybe just putting this stuff on hold, right now, and let me deal with some of the other stuff that i'm going through. and"
298.0,Provider,i'm open to that i'm glad you told me I. surprised that that's the effect it had on you.
14334.0,Patient,"I took it one day I may wait I waited till the weekend. So i'm like I have no, I have to go let's just. And I took it Saturday morning and i'm like i'm glad I don't even have to drive anywhere. yeah so I like. That whether it's just was too high, I don't know but still. yeah so that's not an option for me."
298.0,Provider,"So. What happened refresh my memory, when you took just plain old the adderall."
14334.0,Patient,"pretty much the same thing, so we thought that maybe if we tried the extended it'd be a little bit less throughout the day, not all at once. But we also put me on 25 this time, whereas we talked about at five was the regular at all."
298.0,Provider,"A part of me agrees with manny and another part of me says well let's let's see if another medicine gives you a better effect, you only have to try it like once and you'll know."
14334.0,Patient,"that's what i've been doing, I mean. first time I, the first time I had adderall I didn't feel much the first day my only took five, the first couple of days, and after three days, and then I started feeling like URL. I get Someone described me it's like I joined an ADHD group and they're like sometimes it's just that you feel like you're actually relaxed. compared to when you're already are and that's what it is i'm like. yeah but i'm not getting anything done because of how i'm feeling."
298.0,Provider,"i'm feeling. Well it's up to you, but would you be interested in doing another trial or do you just want to skip at all."
14334.0,Patient,Interested yes.

14334.0,Patient,"Okay, just making sure."
298.0,Provider,"wellbutrin has to be one of my favorite men's it again it's like that you. have to take it in the morning because it can give you energy. Again you're special I don't know why things work the way they do with. You i'm. Having said that, it's still my favorite medicine. Okay, so take it once in the morning. If you have no negative side effects it's not as strong as a stimulant if you have no side effects, then we will increase it to a more therapeutic dose but we don't do that just to make sure that you're not we don't do that too we're sure."
14334.0,Patient,"that it makes sense. yeah yeah i've always said i'm sensitive to medication, so I always try and start with a lower dose and work yeah that's me yeah. The only thing is, I I leave tomorrow morning for two weeks, so I won't."
298.0,Provider,"yeah don't don't even worry about this trial till when you come back and and and it's nothing's gonna hurt to just wait. So, but try, if you can I just hope that they don't see they'll try to put it in your mailbox for you to pick up and then you won't be there."
