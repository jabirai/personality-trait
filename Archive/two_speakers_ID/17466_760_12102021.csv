17466.0,Patient,Hello.
760.0,Provider,hi Brady.
17466.0,Patient,i'm sorry i'm late your your virtual waiting rooms seem to be having some difficulty and they they they were a little late and admitted me.
760.0,Provider,Oh okay.
17466.0,Patient,i'm sorry about that um I have to tell you do I call you Lisa what should I call you.
760.0,Provider,You can call me Lisa.
17466.0,Patient,"Okay Lisa i'm i'm not really sure why i'm here um I do have a therapist I see and i'm not sure how aware, you are of my history, or what what what our agenda here is maybe you can tell me."
760.0,Provider,"Well you've applied for treatment with bright heart health um, can you tell me why you why you did that. Well, what was the what was the the need that you were."
17466.0,Patient,"So Okay, so you so you do not have any of my history."
760.0,Provider,I do have some of your history but um. yeah. Somebody I know you're having trouble with sleep I know. you've got some mental health things going on.
17466.0,Patient,"yeah so i'm. In the middle of November, after a long period where everything was fine I was sleeping fine I was. Dealing with my anxiety fine I had been using under my doctor's guidance, I had been using a marijuana daily to control, some of my anxiety. And then it seems somehow that stopped working, I think I just became so. I built up a tolerance to the TV and I started, let me just let this dog out of the rooms."
760.0,Provider,"No it's Okay, they get demanding."
17466.0,Patient,"and All of a sudden, I had several nights in a row that I couldn't that I didn't sleep at all, I went like five days without sleeping at all. I made the and I kind of panicked and I went to the emergency room and I stupidly made one comments that I had had a thought of hurting myself and then that resulted in them holding me for three days. And then, since the doctor there put me on a combination of seroquel and murtaza pain and I tried that for a week and that wasn't working and I saw one of your nurse practitioners."
760.0,Provider,I say.
17466.0,Patient,"And then she just a week ago. or actually not even a week ago this past Monday took me off of the seroquel murtaza pain and wanted me to take a rest or ill, which for several days which I was hesitant to do because it's a benzodiazepine and I don't want."
760.0,Provider,To be.
17466.0,Patient,"addicted to that and so right now i'm i'm sleeping some with the rest are ill, but I don't really have a long term plan this whole episode has resulted in me having to quit my job. I mean i'm a freelancer I had to pull out of the projects, I was working on, I have been a wreck I haven't really been able to do anything it's still hard for me to go to sleep i'm not even sure I think I slept last night but i'm not even sure, but again, that was. kind of fake sleep, because it was with the rest are ill, I do have a therapist i've been seeing for many years. Okay he's kind of puzzled of how I went from you know everything being just fantastic to literally within a few days, my life turning into a wreck and so right now I had to cancel a couple business trips, I was going to take next week. Okay, and i'm. Trying to determine when I can get back to normal, I have another business trip scheduled for January 5. And i'm i'm just not sure where i'm at or where to go I don't know if my current therapist even knows how to help me. I have an appointment at a sleep clinic this Monday I had made but i'm not even sure if that's appropriate because I think the sleep clinic treats more physiological problems and psychological problems, but I figured it couldn't hurt to go and see that doctor."
760.0,Provider,"But it's sometimes you can roll things out sometimes two things can be true. I guess but look, can I can I stop you for just a minute Q about can you describe, when you started using marijuana how often were you using marijuana how much, how are you smoking were you with edibles talk about that a little bit."
17466.0,Patient,"I started a little less than two years ago. Okay, I was exclusively vaporizing. Okay until towards the end in the last few months, I had experimented with taking just pure thc tablets, and then I realized wait a minute this this isn't right I I can't keep taking more and more I need to stop this. And so. I just kind of stopped cold Turkey around the 12th of November."
760.0,Provider,"So what what period of time, so how is this are we talking about daily use or a lot to me okay so daily. I will, how much daily."
17466.0,Patient,"So you know, over time, in retrospect, I see that it grew and grew I probably until about six months ago I was really just baking in the evening. Okay um and then I started doing a little more during the day, and then I was still mostly limiting it to the late afternoon and evening. But then I realized, you know the reason I was trying more and more and different things, is that I wasn't feeling anything and it wasn't calling me. And that's when I realized, you know I got I gotta stop this and so part of my theory is it's possible this whole current episode, maybe is just caused by withdraw from my having you know cut myself off from that you know, in taking that thc."
760.0,Provider,"Well, I can let you know that insomnia, is a side effect of withdrawal from marijuana. So, but you know it could be, possibly a combination of things that did you struggle with in some insomnia, before is that been an ongoing issue that. It was. Sometime or how would you. Get that okay was."
17466.0,Patient,"It was the reason I originally started using the marijuana I had had some issues with the benzodiazepines I didn't know kind of like I didn't like what they did to me and the hangover effect they had, and they were addictive, and so it was actually my doctor who suggested I try it. But then it, I think it kind of got out of control."
760.0,Provider,"yeah it can it can you know, obviously, your tolerance goes up. And I think over time, although in the moment that you're under the influence it can give you some relief from some of the symptoms. But, over time, it can make the symptoms worse on the long term that makes some sense to you and I, I I suspect that that could be part of it was there anything else going on in your life that was out of the ordinary causing additional stress or pain or. No memory of past trauma anything. else that you could."
17466.0,Patient,"Okay thing in my life was going. swimmingly everything was my business was good. Okay marriage was good, I mean everything was good, I do I have i'm a i'm responsible for managing the care of my elderly parents, my father is. An alzheimers disease, they. Okay hi a big stress. It is now they have a live in caregiver my main responsibility is managing their finances to make sure they can continue to afford the live in caregiver I take them to all their doctors appointments. And they are struggling with the finances and i've been you know I went through this year I was fighting with the veterans administration on my father's disability payment and I finally one that I had just won that fight in in October. I run my year long appeals, so I mean everything there really wasn't everything was going great. And then, it was really just about you know, in this first the first week of November, when I had this period of I didn't sleep for five nights in a row and that's. Just from having not slept that long when I had the strange thoughts and hurting myself and I I haven't had those thoughts since. Okay um and you know so right now i've removed myself i'm a freelancer so I pulled out of the projects, I was working on, so I don't have any work right now. But you know when i'm feel i'm ready to start working again I have clients through ready to hire me again, you know I didn't get in the details I just said i'm having a medical problem i'm taking a break for the month of December. Okay um but no, there really aren't any other my stressor now is worrying about my own finances, because I just quit these jobs and we still have the bills coming in it's like I created the stressors that are stressing me now. Yes, and then still when it when it, you know approaches bedtime now each night I I get nervous, am I going to sleep. You know i'm taking this restaurant for a few days, but I know that's a that's a temporary solution, because the the benzodiazepines are kind of fake sleep and the bright heart nurse practitioner. has not really made clear to me what the plan you know she wanted me to try the rest are ill, for you know for seven or nine days, which will be over on Monday, but i'm not really clear what the plan is after that. And I just spend my time worrying about Okay, what is going to get me back to normal, if this is thc withdrawal, how long will it take me to get over that and am I going to be able to go on this very important business trip on January, the third."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so you've got about what three three weeks or maybe a little over three weeks for that okay all right um why. I guess you know, the purpose of this was to kind of meet with you and and find out what's going on with you, I did read your record. But I think it, you know meeting with you is giving me a lot more information than just reading the file. So, can you talk to me about the distress or how long you've been caring for your is it both parents with alzheimer's or just your father."
17466.0,Patient,"You know so just just my 87 year old father has advanced alzheimers he lives with my 93 year old mother, who is surprisingly good good good health, for her age, but my mother is only problem is the risk of falling down which. She has not for some time, they have a 24 seven live in caregiver that comes at a cost of about $7,000 a month. My my father's government pension is about $5,000 a month because va benefit is about 1700 dollars a month and their savings, you know coverage, the rest, but their their savings, you know is running down."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so is that something that might be weighing on you, is just because I know you said you're you're monitoring all of that so. yeah maybe that's been building that worry and. Stress about what am I going to do if this runs out."
17466.0,Patient,"Yes, certainly that does weigh on me, but not nearly the amount that what is currently weighing on me is that i've let down to have my clients by pulling out of these projects, this month and my worrying about. Am I going to be able to work again, because if i'm not my number one worry by far over everything else is when. Am I going to start sleeping regularly again to the point where I can trust that I will be able to work, you know I can't do my work, the next day if I haven't slept That is my number one worry and Mike you know my therapist i've been seeing for years he seems just very puzzled. I don't think he sure how to help me he's not sure you know what flip the switch. Maybe it makes sense I don't know if I continue to see him, and if it makes sense for me to start seeing you I get a good vibe from you, but I I don't know i'm sorry I keep talking and I know what you asked me questions."
760.0,Provider,"Well, I through this conversation. Brady you're you're letting me know what's going on with you. And so I kind of like to hear from you what's most important to you right now and then from there, we can fill in the blanks. Okay, so that's the way I use."
17466.0,Patient,"To me, is understanding what is the plan that the bright heart nurse practitioner has, for me, beyond taking the rest of real here for these few days. You know I don't have a high level of trust with her, because I just i've only met with her twice for 15 minutes each time. Okay, and I don't understand how she can figure out what medications are appropriate for me when I don't even she hasn't even asked me as much history about myself, as you just have during this one meeting."
760.0,Provider,"huh. Okay, so you're feeling uncertain, do you do you feel do you want to set another appointment with her to ask. You know what Why could you just directly asked some of these issues or concerns because. yeah it's important for you to advocate for your own mental health, and when you have questions or concerns just. You know."
17466.0,Patient,"She my next actual appointment with her is not until December 20. But I have been in correspondence with her via email. Okay, and. She did say she she wants me to continue the rest are ill and touch base with her this Monday and."
760.0,Provider,via email.
17466.0,Patient,"But via email. Okay, and she said she could prescribe additional restaurant if she thought that was appropriate she had mentioned that. If the restaurant was not working, but but I mean it does seem to be working that she was going to try me on Doc sub pin. Okay, but she said, but if she did that I would have to go get an ekg because that can have some cardiac effects and then that scared me and. Okay, you know and i'm just skeptical that someone I can see, on zoom, for you know, a couple times for 15 minutes can really understand what medications are appropriate for me okay."
760.0,Provider,Okay.
17466.0,Patient,I haven't looked into trying to find a local psychiatry but. I couldn't get an appointment with any local psychiatrist I couldn't find any you know that it was hard to find any took my insurance and then. I think any I found there they were like scheduling appointments for the end of January so i'm just not sure what to do and i'm not sure what you know i'm not seeing a path to when i'm going to start sleeping regularly again that's what will make me relax.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, all right well. I guess, I would suggest, for you to consider that you know this is kind of a process i'm trying to figure out, you know the cause, what happened, what to do about it, you know, sometimes it takes, you know. Communication and trying things you know if you have doubts about a medication, though, you know, did you express those doubts about the one that she wanted you to take that or might want you to take that requires the ekg first did you express any kind of concern or."
17466.0,Patient,"I I I did. I mean I fresh doubts about. You know the currently taking the benzodiazepine because. Okay, a long ago, when I was you know I mean i've had anxiety for a long time, and a very long time ago, more than 10 years ago I had taken ambien and it caused me some some memory issues that that were greatly disturbing to me that scared me things. I didn't remember."
760.0,Provider,Okay.
17466.0,Patient,"But I I think her goal was she she wanted me to get just a few nights in a row of. thing, even if it meant taking the benzodiazepine."
760.0,Provider,"I think I think that's I mean I can't speak for what's in her head so i'm going to start there. But, from my perspective, what's in my head with you, based on this, you know short conversation we've had so far is that I know that when fears. A negative thoughts build up causing anxiety, causing depression, all those kinds of things they have a tendency to spiral. And kind of can become like self fulfilling you know the worry about sleeping could perhaps even keep you up, and so the main thing right now is to safely stabilize you to calm, all of this down. So that medications can be adjusted and changed as needed between you and her in the future, and you learn other ways of coping."
17466.0,Patient,Right.
760.0,Provider,"So that would be that would be my my thought with you just based on this short conversation. You know her side is the medication and i'm always going to kind of courage you to advocate for yourself take your medication like you're supposed to and ask questions right and and even get a second opinion, if you think that something. or even just do some research about a certain medication."
17466.0,Patient,"yeah and I have and I neglected to say, in addition to the The rest are ill, which is the sleeping medication benzodiazepine she also put me on a very low dose of abilify. Are you familiar with that."
760.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
17466.0,Patient,"I understand is an Anti psychotic but she said, and I confirm with my own research at lower dosages that is used for to treat anxiety. Okay um, I guess, my question is since her name is Mary cast nurse and she's part of bright health. I mean. If I were to continue to see you can you and she consult to can you consult with her about me."
760.0,Provider,"Well, I do, I mean even right now bright heart health is kind of is a very unique. Company we you know, I have the ability, right now, if you were to have meditation concerns I can you know, put the zoom image to the side here on my screen and. Go and message medication concerns or I can message people I can't guarantee that i'll get an answer right away, but we can you know I do certainly consent or. Talk I mean it's not my side to do the medication, though i'm not the prescriber but if you're having issues or questions or, I feel that there's a need that you need to talk to somebody I I just like I have i'm I will. get something set up so at least there's an appointment set to meet with them so. um. So that's you know, I think. The. Perhaps you could send an email earlier and maybe you don't have to wait till Monday if you're really feeling worried about it i'd hate to see you swing over the next couple of days, over the weekend, like you know, maybe later today, you could even just email her. These questions and concerns. Because you know, ask the questions see what the answer is and go from there."
17466.0,Patient,"I mean, sometimes you know she's been nice to email me back, but. Sometimes it seems like that the tone of her emails is that i'm bothering her or i'm asking too many questions or. You know I think she senses I don't. Maybe trust her she's like you have to trust me and i'm like well i'm not understanding what what what the long term plan is. But yes like I could send her an email."
760.0,Provider,"Sometimes, sometimes it takes time for a medication to build and you don't know and she doesn't know the effectiveness of something. Until that happens so there's a certain. You know I get. The the the importance and the stress that it's causing and the worry wanting to go to work you've got all these other things going on, but within the circle of what we can control, we can only do this little amount. Right and like and then we and then tomorrow we wake up and we reassess. And we see what changes are and we just kind of keep going until medications have had a time to work if your symptoms become so bad that it's either not effective, the medication or you're having like terrible side effects, then those are times that. reach out and ask those questions, too, but. You know understanding that this is a process Brady and I know you want it now I wish we could give it to you now."
17466.0,Patient,I know I tend to want instant. gratification and.
760.0,Provider,"A so so that's kind of my department. You know, learning how to calm, I like to break it down to this is what I can control this this set of things that i'm doing, I think, control and this set of things over here, even though I may not like the way it is, I cannot control them. Well, I and kind of because when I start and spend all my time worrying and stressing and building anxiety over the things I can't change, no matter what it's really for nothing you're really just kind of building that anxiety and getting on that hamster wheel. So this is like new ways of thinking and processing stress. If that makes some kind of sense to."
17466.0,Patient,"It does, I get a good vibe from you Lisa and i'm you know my other therapists that I see here locally, you know I mean maybe I need a new perspective from someone like you, would you be willing, would it make sense for me to make at least one more appointment to see you next week."
760.0,Provider,"I think I think it would make sense to. continue. Because what you've been doing. isn't isn't working right now, maybe it worked in the past, maybe it's going to work again in the future, I I don't know but right now you're you're struggling so let's you know try a different perspective that might be a good thing."
17466.0,Patient,How much of what i've described to you could be directly a result of my withdrawal from the thc.
760.0,Provider,well. i'm.
17466.0,Patient,I know there's not a lot of research on this and most doctors say you know we don't know.
760.0,Provider,"I don't really know, but I do what I do know when when we. You know I know there's a lot of there can be a lot of benefits doctors. With the thc, but I also know that when we take substances such as that I think over time, it can make the mental health symptoms more severe. Because what happens is that that is a medication that affects you the reasoning part of your brain, so it works, because you're basically shutting down emotions, but those emotions they there, you may not be aware of it, if you just wait. But they're still there and so over time it builds right and it takes away your ability to learn more balanced, more healthy ways to cope."
17466.0,Patient,got it.
760.0,Provider,That makes some kind of sense to you.
17466.0,Patient,It does it does.
760.0,Provider,"And I really I really would also question. The stress of. Caring for both parents, because you know I, I had the experience of caring for my mother in law with dementia, who lived to be like 92 and I know the stress that."
17466.0,Patient,yeah.
760.0,Provider,And I know I have the caretaker.
17466.0,Patient,Right yeah I have the caretaker you know i'm i'm actually going today to take them to an eye doctor appointment.
760.0,Provider,"Well, even that. yeah that can be a lot because. A lot of medical appointments for even one. elderly person, and that is."
17466.0,Patient,"But again i'll tell you, if the one thing if I just knew for certain that. Soon, even if it's that sometime in January i'd be back on a regular sleep pattern, and I could resume my regular work and my regular income that's The one thing if I just had that one bit of knowledge, I think I would be fine."
760.0,Provider,Okay.
17466.0,Patient,"So in so I guess two things I will send an email to the nurse practitioner right heart Mary caster and explained to her that i'm. nervous about not really understanding what's going to happen, you know that I can only take this benzodiazepine for a short amount of time and that i'm not comfortable with her suggestion of my taking a different drug that could potentially cause, you know."
760.0,Provider,"cardiac issue, I mean she's she's not suggesting it."
17466.0,Patient,Yet right.
760.0,Provider,"He said, we might."
17466.0,Patient,We might.
760.0,Provider,"You know it's it's let's a lot of times it's our perception, we, the brain has a tendency. To go to the worst case scenario, and we in instead of being in the moment we're going to the worst case scenario, and this is what we think is going to happen, and this is what our brain, and so we sit and we do and we build. This hasn't happened. So let's one of the things that I want to work on with you is learning to be more in the moment. Being you know present because you know you can ask her the The next question, you can ask, or is there something else that we could try instead. You know, but but let's see what's working right now. let's see what happens give this the. Time that it needs to assess. and see how it works for you."
17466.0,Patient,Okay.
760.0,Provider,That does that ring make some kind of.
17466.0,Patient,"It does, would it would it be normal for you to reach out to her for the two of you to discuss my case or does, do you not really do that."
760.0,Provider,"it's not something we do because she the PR scriber she she's just going to be, you know the symptoms of you know your lack of sleep, or are you sleeping you know where's where's your anxiety level those kinds of things my goal is to help you with the non medication stuff. The other more positive coping. skill stuff without the medication, but sometimes it's necessary to have both because, as I said earlier, if we don't stabilize people have a tendency to spiral, and we don't want that to happen."
17466.0,Patient,"Right right, how would I go about making an appointment with you for how frequently in a case like mine, would a patient see you."
760.0,Provider,"Normally it's twice monthly, but if you want to make the request. For once weekly we can you can make that request I I don't do my own scheduling it's the care navigators that schedule. With a company. But I don't know how do you know how to reach out to the virtual planet. I am do that."
17466.0,Patient,"I do, yes."
760.0,Provider,And then. there's group sessions that you attend as well.
17466.0,Patient,"Oh i'm not interested in doing that. Okay, and you."
760.0,Provider,Can you explain to me what what what that feeling or thought is about.
17466.0,Patient,i'm not interested in talking about my problems to a group injuries and hearing about their problems i'm i'm i'm just not.
760.0,Provider,Okay okay.
17466.0,Patient,Is that required.
760.0,Provider,"Normally, yes, but i'm case by case. i've seen it get set to the side. So yeah we could make that it will all we can make that request, who is your. You said, Mary what's her name again Mary."
17466.0,Patient,kastner K s te n er.
760.0,Provider,"Alright, so we I can consult with her about that. So okay so let's you've given me quite a little bit. How how how is your relationship now with your wife, he said, your your marriage was a happy marriage. Going now he even though you're going through this other turmoil Hello and."
17466.0,Patient,"Already everything there is fine, I mean she's very stressed about what i'm."
760.0,Provider,worried about you yeah and she feels.
17466.0,Patient,"You know, bad that she doesn't know how to help me but she's been she's been my rock she led Okay, you know when I start to. spiral, as you say she's good at bringing me back down reminding me that i'm it's not going to be instant gratification and you know my I will say my daytime anxiety level is very good, compared to just two weeks ago i'm not. i'm not feeling anxious i'm not feeling physically anxious right now. and have a day, as I was a couple weeks ago."
760.0,Provider,That was.
17466.0,Patient,"That has been a big improvement. it's more uncertainty and concern over how this episode has affected my financial income. You know we're we're scheduled to take delivery of a new vehicle next week, which had been arranged months ago, and so now i'm like. You know if I was working as I was normally working it wouldn't have even been a thought now i'm like oh my gosh can we afford this car that i'm already contractually obligated to. You know."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so okay yeah then. yeah so you kind of have to kind of go with the flow with that and try to. i'm what i'd like to start working with you is a concept called mindfulness mindfulness is a practice it's not something that people learn overnight you kind of have to work towards it, and I know with. It seems like you've got financial worries on both sides for both your parents and then also your own household. So I know it's hard to turn that off. Yet that's one of the things that I. would like to start."
17466.0,Patient,Doing with you and you. work again.
760.0,Provider,working.
17466.0,Patient,"I could turn it off if if I knew I was going to start sleeping and therefore could start working the financial worries go away. Okay, you know."
760.0,Provider,"Yes, yes, so, but sometimes we can worry about worry and then we can't sleep and then I. write again so you know, taking deep breaths. Making sure you get the proper exercise, so that you burn those worry. And then anxiety that you know that needs to the body needs to move."
17466.0,Patient,"And I didn't mention to you I i've been maintaining my weight for the last week, but between the 15th and about the over about a two week period I lost 12 pounds."
760.0,Provider,Just from all of this.
17466.0,Patient,"For from from all of this, especially the three days in the hospital but i'm I have already built back up just a couple pounds and i'm i'm focusing on increasing my caloric intake even though my appetite has been terrible."
760.0,Provider,"Okay well why don't you um. One one suggestion that I would make the between now and our next session is start writing a journal, and what you're thinking what you're feeling what's going on for you. Be sure to mark the progress start looking at the positive things that are improving, because. From the short conversation I, and I know it's natural we worry about things going wrong, I think the human brain is kind of wired to. protect oneself from things going wrong and keeping us safe, but at the same time, when we still on that that's how anxiety builds and that's what's going to be one of the things keeping you up so keeping a list of the progress that you're making you know, because you already said. Your anxieties reduced you've gained weight those kinds of things writing them either on a computer or tablet or on paper, however, is best for. You. and see that so that your brain starts to process the progress."
17466.0,Patient,But only as I tell. The Progress don't write about what i'm worried about.
760.0,Provider,"Yes, because I don't know if you want to build that let's. start, and then you can also add things like the things that you're grateful for you know, and you can just say that because you got a lot of really good things going in your life, you have a very strong marriage, you have a very supportive caring loving wife, not everybody has that so."
