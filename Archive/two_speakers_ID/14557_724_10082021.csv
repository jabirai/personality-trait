724.0,Provider,"Okay. What about caffeine drink coffee energy drink stuff like that it's not a problem. Okay, have you ever been in treatment for substance abuse before you said you had a therapist so was that, like like like something that you saw it out on your own or you. For substance use or is that something that legally, you were."
14557.0,Patient,On like I did on my own.
724.0,Provider,"Okay, and how long how long ago was that."
14557.0,Patient,"Like how long, I mean like how many how I mean How long have been terrific well there's learn Dave Dave for like a year there was one they circulate just one answer for six mom the last one there rely."
724.0,Provider,"So, so no programs like this before right, so no nothing like this before."
14557.0,Patient,"Why, why are you. guys are like turkeys to know."
724.0,Provider,"yeah yeah like outpatient services, but we have like wrapped around stuff where it's like people come here they get. They get therapy for substance use to get therapy for mental health, a lot of times there's a medication component attached to it, we provide medication, we put people in individual sessions we put them in groups we do. Drug screens on a it's called like Level one care, you know it's different than finding like a like a random. Qualified therapists like a single therapist it's like self employed and stuff like this, this is like like a program with wraparound services. Case management medical all kinds of stuff whereas if you went to like just a singular therapist you would just see that person once a month or whatever it was, and that was it like they did everything for you, and that was that."
14557.0,Patient,"gonna be my turn, so that means like i'm going to see every time the every week different therapists you."
724.0,Provider,"Know you're probably assigned to me if we're doing this assessment, that means that you're assigned to me but."
14557.0,Patient,I don't. want to be telling my province to every single.
724.0,Provider,"way, no, no, no, it doesn't work that way but you're assigned like like a like a primary therapist but then you'll meet in groups, probably with other therapists. But you'll be in that same group so since that group that you're in now that you don't like I have to find a group that you're going to fit in but it's probably not going to be a group with me."
14557.0,Patient,And white people okay.
724.0,Provider,"So you. got to do it with you'll have to to have interactions with that therapist and then you're a physician so Sharon, I think, is the primary here for you."
14557.0,Patient,Sharon sets.
724.0,Provider,"So it'll have to be a group with Sharon that she's into it and I don't do groups with Sharon, but that doesn't mean that that you don't come back and you know talk to me for our individual sessions makes sense. Well, so that's normally how it works. So if you haven't been in a program like this, I will say that you never been like a program like this before that, but you've had had therapy before correct. yeah okay all right. Have you ever experienced any kind of like withdrawal symptoms, when you stop using crystal meth. Any physical withdrawal symptoms."
14557.0,Patient,began like fighting a. bumpy like not like when I realized. That. It will happen like. know all the time for too long. yeah like every like a. Like a week.
724.0,Provider,Okay um any history of like blackouts or anything like that loss of time. alright. what's the longest period that that you went. Without any methamphetamine use like what's the longest you've gone.
14557.0,Patient,"Well, like literally like."
724.0,Provider,"Total ever since you started using methamphetamine so the time that to current time. Here, two years without it Okay, and how long ago was that."
14557.0,Patient,boy yeah okay good.
724.0,Provider,Okay. And what was going on during that timeframe that you didn't use it.
14557.0,Patient,"Like. Like I try it. men like my first boyfriend and then I. know I. know. anyway. yeah so and then I don't know very heartbreaking. And then I don't know start feeling really bad and then I start using again right, but then I was telling you. Like that no one's using lottery lottery tomorrow and. I know, like like yeah but then no my God your semester, and then like we have two more familiar with it, and I think it's really. awesome very depressed and I. Think at the end of the year and I don't please. don't like hurry like. Like. cinnamon. Tell like offer. Then I become a team and then insert again when you're. In. A display ad they want to have. And then Well he held me and. Like i've been pretty like I. Like the way I will win the game. runs into. That this isn't about it because, like i'm walking industry, and then I said guys, we did it once and then guys psycho hey what's this calm and then I want to say no, then just go say hi just starting. department name like no. way."

14557.0,Patient,"On my I know my psychiatrist told me like I have some. Again, say, like, I was saying no he had like some traits of like borderline personality."
724.0,Provider,Okay well you weren't officially diagnosed. Okay.
14557.0,Patient,"Because we. Like. 7.5 pounds like a very famous place and. I believe pull. And then I like but, but I think pretty much everyone was in a stable situation has been to like a an impulse because i'm able to deal with the pain sudden, so I don't know what."
724.0,Provider,"All right, and have you ever been prescribed any medication for for any mental health concerns."
14557.0,Patient,I was thinking. Like. hey.
724.0,Provider,Were you diagnosed with anxiety. Be generalized anxiety or anything like that.
14557.0,Patient,"No, no, La la i'm just wanting to help me to like. But it was weird because, like I like she told me to like I need to drink, like every day like. Like. All that out and taking like our segment only one when I was thinking that we. Can. work. With you know. Like like I was going to start drinking because i'm. hi go like the medication is to be like material for cool. So symphony top life life is I need to look for a job for me to apply for a job when I was being lazy like oh my gosh dimensions, or the communication side be like."
724.0,Provider,So yeah so less anxious about them.
14557.0,Patient,Yet so yeah like you helped me willing it but it's not like every day it's just like when I need to do something. I have become very anxiety and like very frustrated.
724.0,Provider,"All right. Okay um Have you ever been hospitalized for any mental health concerns. Any history of self harm or behavior suicidal thoughts. You know, attempts anything like that. Now. Okay. Any history of trauma physical abuse mental abuse emotional abuse neglect. abandonment."
14557.0,Patient,I. was in trauma my other therapies kept on he was travel.
724.0,Provider,What was.
14557.0,Patient,"Life like those alone. i'm in legos or no, no, Sir we've done like my grandfather they hit him in chrome my inculcating minecraft my mom and I love fighting in probably. Most likely nurture but then, like our turkeys told me that actually in wall like."
724.0,Provider,"yeah yeah absolutely. being exposed to childhood abuse, even if it's not you is very traumatic and it has a way of impacting your cognitive development moving forward, you know, some people might find. That type of behavior be normal because they don't know anything different and then, when, as they get older they realize that that their parents fighting or beating the crap out of each other isn't normal or beating the crap out of the siblings isn't normal like. yeah it'll have prolonged effects on your on your ability to process things it is traumatic in a sense, a lot of people when they talk about trauma and ptsd. The first thing that comes to most people's mind is like military people right but that's not always the case, you can you can get ptsd from a car accident, if you experience an event that's so traumatic that it triggers your sympathetic nervous system right your fight or flight. And that's a form of trauma right and that can stay with you for a long time, if you don't process it, you know, accordingly, you know it can have long term effects on you. So ptsd back in a day when you would think of like a soldier having ptsd is probably more of a traumatic brain injury type now is what we're learning in that field is that. Being around a lot of gunshots or explosions, you have what they call being Shell shocked, but they're concussions in your brain it's actually. brain damage that's. causing some of the instability and not so much the cognitive response to the event."
14557.0,Patient,"can be like an old guy who those. ache. Oh no come back many, many combat."
724.0,Provider,medic.
14557.0,Patient,"yeah yeah. yeah so, then I I don't like is probably like I told him I probably have ptsd and it's like no I don't have any but then like I remember thinking like I was like do it, and she needs to follow looking out because, like different food in India is slow. Like. That yeah good I think about like like like like should I try to be aware of."
724.0,Provider,"yeah yeah it definitely is what happens is that your your automatic nervous system is with, especially for military people it's switched on. And then at that fight or flight mode is kicked off, more often than not it's hard to switch off and go into like the natural mode, which is like your rest and digest mode right where it's like your body's natural state where it just hanging out. that's what it wants to do, but if you're amped up like that so like first responders firefighters COPs emt paramedics they're seeing a lot of stuff that's very should be traumatic because you're not exposed to that that type of lifestyle, most people aren't. So there's some."
14557.0,Patient,"Good did an internship in this hospital in Mexico. To wanna. And then we see a lot of refugees. First week like I did it for a month, like the first week I did it, it was very traumatizing like I felt like I didn't know, I was from a party's been on I was Okay, with it, but I couldn't sleep. yep there. It is so much like. Like I was so many stuff like all all day you never see like literally people fully burn they can see the entire car noon. And I have to like cleaning out the window and like. I didn't like I wasn't a yard know like not like that, but then. I feel like those little things and, unlike impact me that third leg because I couldn't sleep, the first week."
724.0,Provider,"Of course, and we're not exposed that that type of stuff normally most humans are not exposed to the same same level of. life and death scenarios that people hospital setting especially yours. Military people. You know, it takes a special kind of person to even think about working in those settings, let alone stay in those settings To begin with, because a lot of people get weeded out right away like they like the idea of working in an er. going off to war, this is something that that certain people do so, the people that do already have a certain level of resiliency my opinion already built in so they're already prepared for that a little bit, but sometimes like the horror of life. You cannot prepare for is tough, as you think you are as confident as you are. It has a way of affecting you and having like reoccurring dreams are being wrestlers. Are on edge Those are all forms of trauma right it's just your body processing the event it's your mind trying to process the event at a sometimes you can't turn that off. And the more you're exposed to it and you can't turn that off the board of a problem, it will be long term so it's important to at least process those events, a little bit talk about it talk about it with other people. Try to like try to understand what's going on with your body, the the automatic nervous system, as you know. Is it something that you have any control over it just it's going it does its thing with or without your liking and it's just part of it. So your parasympathetic nervous system when it kicks into fight or flight it's really not up to you, like like it's your body's automatic response to a threat and it stays in that setting for a long time, and some. People never turn it off. And that's where you see like. On the other end of the spectrum where. People are just like so debilitated that they can't function in. Society loud noises they just you know fourth of July comes around and they just can't even exist, you know what I mean like they have to hide somewhere like it's always one extreme or another. um. yeah. So that's that's pretty much it, you know what do you do for fun, what are your what are your hobbies what are your recreational activities that we like to do for yourself."
14557.0,Patient,"Like. Like like like to. run. Then. problem. Because, then I said son and a hand, you know my drinking."
724.0,Provider,"Well, as a. Drug counselor I could never encourage drinking it as being a healthy recreational activity, because a lot of secondary negativity can fall as a result of that. don't mean to you eyes blackouts all kinds of bad stuff can happen from drinking, so I can never be like cool that's a good recreational activity, because it's it's an unhealthy activity for sure."
14557.0,Patient,I never liked and I don't. mean like I.
724.0,Provider,"Know moderation is key, you know, being aware of your surroundings, knowing your limits, you know those those are the most things, I can advocate for people when they drink and I tell that the people. That i'm friends with you know what I mean like as out of the counselor capacity i'm just like hey man like watch your drink in. know your outs, if you need a ride call like just be smart be safe, about it, there are ways to be able to consume alcohol and have a functional good time, but there are. You know, there are. high risk things that come with that too. You know what I mean so just be careful with. It but. physical exercise and activity those always like some of the best things for overall. So that's good. All right, so that's pretty much the deal Sergio so what i'll do is i'm going to submit an inquiry. To get your group switched. Because you're not happy with that."
14557.0,Patient,Group.
724.0,Provider,and see if I can get you into something else. And then. i'll make another appointment with you to see me in a couple of. All right. You still there.
14557.0,Patient,yeah I couldn't hear. You.
724.0,Provider,"Yet so i'm going to submit a request to get your group switch to something more practical for you, so that might take a little bit um. I want to schedule an appointment with with you and me to follow up in a couple of weeks for our second individual for the month and then we'll go from there okay."
14557.0,Patient,My week.
724.0,Provider,"yep 70 weeks yep the groups are every week and then the one on one with me is every two weeks. Oh OK so i'll schedule your follow up with me right now. What time works, good for you."

724.0,Provider,"Have a good. For transcription That was the psychosocial assessment for Sergio Rodriguez his audio cut in and out quite frequently I did my best generalize or catch what he was trying to say, it appears that he's here for. stimulant use methamphetamines that he cycles on and off of periodically. doesn't experience tremendous withdrawal symptoms from it, he may have underlying mental health concerns that will potentially need to be addressed, while he's here. He said he had borderline personality traits by a previous provider. But i'm not sure we'll have to continue to monitor him and driven individual therapy he's not happy with the group that he's currently in. Because he doesn't necessarily identify as having a drug problem so i'm gonna put a request in which is provided this get him place in a mental health group if there's one available, and then we will go there, we have follow up. October 21 at. he's also low risk for suicidal ideation and tabs behavior all that kind of stuff. he's got no reported history of any of it so again, will continue to monitor all those things during his individual sessions and that's it Thank you."
