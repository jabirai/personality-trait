I guess she flung a drink after Adam and everything and walked out of the place they were at and he went running out and gotten the car and couldn't get out of the car and. They fought all the way home I didn't get home until five in the morning, well, I didn't my problem you want to be that stupid and stay out all night that's your problem, you told me you're going to be here at a certain time, you need to be here. don't play this shit with me because you're going to get me to where. yeah i'm gonna quit don't know.

5110.0,Patient,"Right right. huh. The other day, he was in a funny mood Tuesday, he laughed all day long anything that's all we did was sit there and laugh and crack up and. that's the door on the weekend, he stayed up all night feel good. You know what I mean and that's what wiped me out because I couldn't get any rest whatsoever and i'm not feeling good and she don't understand that and plus i'm getting old. And I have to tell her that you know yeah you might be able to do it you're 25 I could do a lot, when I was 25. Add 40 years on that and tell me you're going to be doing it. Plus, I do stuff when I don't have my usually outside get word getting my house ready. For winter, something you know there's always something to do and. i'm behind right now, because of being sick."
480.0,Provider,"yeah. So you're watching them tomorrow, is it overnight, I assume, because it's a party. yeah."

5110.0,Patient,"yeah. But then she'll tell me she's not bringing them until three or four o'clock and she'll show up at 1011 in the morning, so that makes it even longer, you know what I mean. Like I said I don't think you."
480.0,Provider,"Like stop like you need to set the boundaries. With her and see if you give me a time, you need to stick to that time, so I can plan around it."
5110.0,Patient,"Well, she made a comment to me, the other day that. She felt like I was complaining, the last couple of times I watched I thought I should Andrea i'm not complaining I don't feel good I don't think you realize that and i'm getting old. mm hmm you know I can't go like I used to and not breathe, at the same time that makes it rough."
480.0,Provider,Oh yeah.
5110.0,Patient,You can't breathe it's hard. You don't want to do nothing i've lost so much weight in the last three weeks it's unreal. Just because even recognize myself.

5110.0,Patient,"I miss Gregory a lot, though Gregory and I have a real good bond and now me and the baby is Doc I get one and I really i'm all she has you know, and I know this, but even a lot of my friends are like God you gotta stop."
480.0,Provider,"that's The difference is you don't want to get to a point where you don't want to do it anymore at all so she just needs to respect boundaries and not take advantage, so you don't ever get to that point of being so burnt out that you're done done. I feel like that's what she's not understanding is if she keeps doing what she's doing you're just going to be done, all together, and that's not something."
5110.0,Patient,"is coming. hmm real quick like it's coming I can feel it. Remember, I said I haven't blown up on anybody in a long time and i'm hoping to validate her because she's not gonna like me after i'm done. And me and her were tight, I mean I used to take it, the kid every summer to take her from her mother, because I knew what her lifestyle was to give her some normalcy and shit you know what I mean and. Whether it would be drive from Tennessee to new Hampshire together and straight back I did it, you know what I mean."
480.0,Provider,And went.
