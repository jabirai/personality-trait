Not benzo based because you don't want to be on it. You can get hooked on um but there's other medications out there that can work with what different medications so that you get kind of that combo result. So you'll just want to talk to the doctor and then let them know that you're not really seeing a difference in your anxiety.

16297.0,Patient,She may be working on and also she just wanted to start one medicine yeah absolutely.
706.0,Provider,"And there's a lot of non stimulant ADHD meds, and that is also something that could be adding to your anxiety because your brain is going so fast. My son is 13 and my husband they both have ADHD and they're there when you have ADHD your brain works differently and then somebody who doesn't.

You sidetrack somewhere exactly um as a mother and a wife of two of the people that have hdl tell you for a person on the outside it's very frustrating, because you don't understand. You know, but yeah you have you have to learn different things to to help you to get better with stay on track things but medication definitely to help you focus.

16297.0,Patient,i'm going to most of the time worrying about my kids my situation you know work. This life.
706.0,Provider,"Okay, so just kind of the day to day stressors. Will Okay, and when you feel really stressed out or anxious, what do you typically do now that you're not smoking marijuana anyone."
16297.0,Patient,"know I try to talk about it. Okay, it helps or not really. occupy my time and. That is kind of hard."
706.0,Provider,"uh huh okay. Okay yeah I definitely think. You need some more tools in your toolbox, so to say, and you just need some you need some go to things that you can do when you get into those places where you're like stuck in your head almost. So that you refocus. Because. Otherwise it'll slowly start to kind of chip away at you. and eventually you'll go back to the thing that worked and obviously that's an issue for you, because then you just smoke all day, every day, so. Yes, and you need to find other things that are more healthy for coping tools in your toolbox, so to say. So we'll work on that with an therapy. How do you feel like your self esteem."
16297.0,Patient,What do you mean by that.
706.0,Provider,"Like you, how do you how do you feel about yourself."
16297.0,Patient,"Well, not feel good about myself the last word."
706.0,Provider,Okay.
16297.0,Patient,Good under control.
706.0,Provider,"uh huh absolutely absolutely and some other things we can work on in therapy to is you know. How to deal with. You know, when you have the the anxiety, the anger, the frustration those types of things better ways to address them because i'm sure you probably didn't mean to push your girlfriend at the time and have her fall. But it was a very impulsive reaction to the situation which partially probably has to do with the ADHD because you're very impulsive. And so, those are all things to that can be worked on how to control that impulsivity how to be able to stop the brain before it does something like that. You know, because then you look back hindsight and you're like I didn't mean to do that, I would never heard her, she was pregnant with. And so, then you have that guilt in that shame so working through all of that and getting a better understanding of that your ADHD your anxiety, the impulsivity and all the things and how they work together. Ending your brain better is going to help you to be able to. Basically figure out what tools are going to work for you for."
16297.0,Patient,The way the.
706.0,Provider,"Brain works and that's our goal is to do that, so you don't need the marijuana so you don't need the alcohol, so that you can be healthier mentally physically, you know and just in life in general. You want to have the best life that you can for you and also for your children. So so we're done with the bps um do you have any other questions."
16297.0,Patient,or no ma'am.
706.0,Provider,"Okay, well, I appreciate you hanging in there with me while I was getting all my technical issues figure it out. So well Nice. Okay. So um well me twice a month. And you'll want to set that up with a virtual clinic where you checked into your bps. And I will go ahead and I will send in your progress report this week, for your bps. That that you. That you had when you finished it and that everything is as of right now is in compliance and that will will start our therapy and then every week I will send a report."
16297.0,Patient,How long do I have to do that.
706.0,Provider,"um that is more of a question that you'll want to ask your probation officer. Look what. We want to see you do, are you supposed to completely. program you know because I do therapy, that we can also work on likes you know and we'll work on skills development but is there, like a specific amount of time they want you to work on substance abuse. You know, like out of a book, you know, do they want you to have like you know get for like an entire almost Program. You know what is it that you're going to be needing to do what is their requirement because we're going to want to build our sessions around obviously what they need you to do. So I would just ask those questions of what the expectations are, and then a couple of weeks, we can discuss it. Oh okay."
16297.0,Patient,Thank you.
706.0,Provider,yeah you're welcome you have a great day.
