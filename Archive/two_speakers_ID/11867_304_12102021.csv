11867.0,Patient,There just one. who started working.
304.0,Provider,"No i'm i'm so sorry thanks for waiting, I thought my other person wasn't gonna shop and then she did. yeah I guess I don't know virtual clinic it's weird because it it showed me that you, you checked in but anyway."
11867.0,Patient,"yeah I waited and i'm like okay well, maybe she'll Come on, and say like sorry i'm running late, so I just kept waiting and waiting and I got your email and i'm like oh crap I wonder what's going on."
304.0,Provider,"So yeah when you first call virtual clinic like you're waiting for them to pick up and then you almost like you have to hang up and then join my zoom room meeting. you're on zoom with them and then, if, like if you go to any other page on your phone. Like it kicks you out of the waiting room. Because if you go to like even a text message, or anything else that accesses your camera or your microphone like it kicks you out and then you're waiting for a half hour, but it's like it keeps taking me back to the back of the line. yeah I know just all this technology, but I sent you the. Number to text so usually that's a lot a lot quicker."
11867.0,Patient,Okay awesome.
304.0,Provider,yeah well I know you're at work today but i'm glad we can at least touch base so gosh since we last talked How are things with nevin what's going on.
11867.0,Patient,"um well they're terrible and i'm pretty sure they're they're probably not it's probably not going to work out. And I was really trying really hard you know, to make it work because it's been so long, and you know we have kids but is it's just getting to the point where he's extremely Nice and now like never in my life, but I think I was going to be in an abusive relationship, you know but. He he calls me horrible names and I know I know why he does it, you know he's he uses that is horrible terrible girlfriend as a you as an excuse, so he can use. he's he's told me that many times like it's like your revenge, but the problem is is nothing i'm not actually doing anything wrong so he's just hurting me just to get high for no reason you know."
304.0,Provider,What was he using amanda.
11867.0,Patient,Is human cracked very badly.
304.0,Provider,And he was he ceiling your medication and taking his medication. It was selling I.
11867.0,Patient,"think he was selling as he was you know he gets to a day, every day, there should be no reason why he's sick or he gets to 12 hours a day, so he's sick all the time and. they're just they're not not adding up to where they should be, but. I don't have no way of knowing if he's just to get higher if you selling them and then he's running out, or if he's eating them all and then running out, I don't know but. I don't. I don't recall overtaking my meds for two weeks in a row, but. they're just gone, you know so."
304.0,Provider,"I mean, it seems like this pattern with you guys is not new and now we're just sort of witness to it um I mean so when you called me. And then he was like answering and i'm like so i'm not going to any sounded angry so i'm like i'm not going to get in the middle of that and i'm trying to speak with you, but so what happened that day did he leave he said he."
11867.0,Patient,"She is very controlling the checks every text message I said he checks at my call logs he checks my bank account for every single dollar I spend. So he checks my phone all the time yeah he ended up getting mad. Because anything is is normally I just I just sit there quietly because my kids don't deserve to share that kind of stuff so i'm not going to entertain that you know which makes it even more mad, but so he ended up leaving for a couple days and. After he's done with court, you want to smoke to indiana was his dad which is fine with me i'm not gonna i'm not going to try to keep him home, you know, but the thing is, is when he's cleaning he's not smoking crashes great."
304.0,Provider,"Just like everybody right, you know the alcoholic who who you know beats you are beats or kids or beat you in front of your kids oh sure he's a great dad when he's not drunk. yeah I mean i'm sure he's a great guy when he's not using but. It seems like this is."
11867.0,Patient,there's always.
304.0,Provider,A pattern he seems like he's always using or the controlling and the manipulation.
11867.0,Patient,"is always using I mean. Is there enough to have him so he's very good at telling me, you know everything that I want to hear, and then I believe him and he's just got this whole secret life that I knew nothing about the years he's he's been doing this for years. And I would have never guessed because he grew up with crack addicts the parents. Just never would have guessed that he would be so okay with that too, but I understand addiction, I know it's a disease, so I try not to you know judging too much for it but it's different when he's hurting us just so we can go get high."
304.0,Provider,"and I mean what would it, what do you want to do amanda he says he's going to leave, I mean his legal stuff is not going to be. resolved for a while. I mean that's my son."
11867.0,Patient,"um The thing is, is I. he already has he got arrested for disorderly conduct because he was screaming and yelling and my name was called the COPs on him and instead he didn't go to jail for domestic because he didn't put hands on me. So now voices they contacted me and everything and he understands that. domestics suck and that's something very hard to get out of you know so. And he says, you know it's not abuse that. he's extremely mean to me. I just don't want how I can't care."
304.0,Provider,And that is abuse. Is abuse.
11867.0,Patient,views.
304.0,Provider,And you are getting healthy. You know if you're working on your recovery and you're you're seeing all of this and you're you're changing you know you're not going to accept his behavior anymore he's he's going to escalate. he's going to lash out and it's a hop skip and a jump or or a hop from emotional abuse physical abuse.
11867.0,Patient,"I agree, and I, I was."
304.0,Provider,I remember you.
11867.0,Patient,"You know i've been scared that it will turn into this and he never has never firsthand he's not pushing away, but I am nervous these days it's. And i'm not the one that's gonna be like Oh well, you know beat the crap out of me but i'm not going to you're going to jail, if you hit me so simple as that you know, but I mean domestics turn into murderers all the time, so scary."
304.0,Provider,"Well yeah if you're scared of him amanda the emotional abuse like someone who, who is going to call you names and emotionally abuse you and the controlling behavior there's there's really no difference in that personality of a man who will hit you. or your kids, for that matter."
11867.0,Patient,"I know I do understand that it's his he has crossed the line that he will never be able to get back from you know and and it hasn't hasn't like I said. i've been like 15 years and he's never he's never been like this, but now he wants me to do bad things that we can have a reason to go get high, but really, in reality, all I do is work and take care of my kids so I shouldn't get punished for just doing the right thing. And I mean he steals my money he takes my card, and he goes and pulls off. I sent him to the store, to give us the tampons he never shut up with tampons and he took all $500 that I have you know."
304.0,Provider,So what do you need to do amanda as far as like you can you get a separate account can you change your direct deposit.
11867.0,Patient,"Yes, I absolutely can and. It sucks when you're in this kind of situation because I love it."
304.0,Provider,don't.
11867.0,Patient,"Like I love it, I wish you could love me, though."
304.0,Provider,"I don't think it's that he doesn't love you but he's he's sick if he's still in his addiction and then this abuse is not love he thinks it is, and you know it's not. I do know it's not falling and and he needs help. And, but it almost sounds like he could go to prison."
11867.0,Patient,yeah he's probably gonna go to present. And you know I think you know I think that's Another reason is because he understands. he's probably going to go to prison and now it's like well I don't have to lose you know but.
304.0,Provider,Did you think he's just kind of like cast screw it.
11867.0,Patient,"And I do, I do think that she's. But you know we I sat down and I. I helped him to this whole case I mean i've got folders and folders and folders of evidence, and you know stuff to help him for this case, and if you wanted to could probably win this case but. I don't know I just think that he. Everything everything's nothing good is ever going to happen and that's the difference because my attitude is the complete opposite I look for the good in every single thing in the whole world and never sees any good in anything I."
304.0,Provider,mean you know I mean he has an attorney so yeah I don't know you know that that might just have to play out how it plays out yeah. And I am often are not implicated in.
11867.0,Patient,I know. i've you know i've never been honest in my life I grew up with good life and i've always been happy and. Just haven't been happy for a while now.
304.0,Provider,"And and that's just my fear for you amanda and the kids you know, like it is abuse emotional abuse financial abuse and they see it your voice see it, they know. And, and the babies even even babies sense it, you know it, even if that baby's brains are growing so quickly even they sense it and it affects their development and. Your boys you don't want them seeing and thinking this is how men treat women you don't want your girls to grow up and think that this is okay."
11867.0,Patient,"it's not. it's not okay at all. But I do know this and I, you know I guess i'm holding on to. everything's gonna be okay, but it's it's not going to be okay."
304.0,Provider,Are you guys legally married. No and have you haven't been subpoenaed or anything. No okay. um. yeah I mean you said you talked to the domestic violence. Voices as i'm.
11867.0,Patient,"Sure, after you went to jail that day. Please have them contact me, so I think I have no. folder now i'm sharing have conversations and. i'm not I. don't."
304.0,Provider,"mean you know I would talk with voices and they could you know, maybe give you some some legal advice as far as like our options. I mean it sounds like you're kind of just waiting to see how things play out with his case, but I just think about safety i'm making work with you on doing a safety plan like just packing a bag. You know, having having some things packed for like in case you have to leave with the kids quickly. Dr amanda do you have a car."
11867.0,Patient,"I do, I have, I drive everywhere, I use my mom's actual vehicle."
304.0,Provider,"Okay, so you know they'll they can talk with you and and you can look online to about the safety plan, but they talk about you know. Having your gas tank for maybe even packing your emergency bags like just a change of clothes toiletries for you in the kids you could Pack that and like maybe hide it in the trunk and then maybe even like hide a spare key in case he tries to take your car keys."
11867.0,Patient,yeah.
304.0,Provider,"tries to take your phone like that is interference with communication he tries to keep you from leaving like those are all domestic violence behaviors, but they are illegal. But, but the abuse the financial abuse the controlling you know the emotional abuse like that, that is, all of us."
11867.0,Patient,"Is it most definitely I was. You know, I was my mom's right she for me about this fight, you know so. i'm very aware, you know i'm aware of what's going on, I understand that's wrong, I get that. And I would never want my daughters to have to those of us, I would never ever allow my son's to put anybody through this because it's it's terrible yeah."
304.0,Provider,"And you don't just repent you, you deserve so much better, and I want you to know that, and I want you to believe that and your kids deserve better. Absolutely and and I hope he he gets help. But that's. that's not for you."
11867.0,Patient,"You know, you know I do to and I, you know my mom has. told him she paid for the rehab you know we've we've tried everything now there's no more there's no more excuses, other than he does he doesn't want to get clean, you know.
