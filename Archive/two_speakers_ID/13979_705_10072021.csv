705.0,Provider,Good afternoon.
13979.0,Patient,There we are. Oh wait a minute it stopped the video.
705.0,Provider,"There, how are it is."
13979.0,Patient,"i'm good, how are you."
705.0,Provider,"i'm doing very well, thank you for asking it is like that sometimes with the video, for whatever reason zoom has its own thing that does sometimes. Just know, in the event that we become disconnected just it, you know leave the meeting come back and then the host will remit. time to time it happens."
13979.0,Patient,Okay well do.
705.0,Provider,"Well, great Well, my name is Valerie Patterson and i'm part of the bright health bright heart health sometimes that's hard for me to say all internal."
13979.0,Patient,It is a tongue twister.
705.0,Provider,"It is, I just say ah ah. Oh, and i'm sure in today it's do you prefer CC Cecilia miss foster."
13979.0,Patient,People call me CC.
705.0,Provider,"Okay, is it Okay, if I call you CC."
13979.0,Patient,"When, of course. You know."
705.0,Provider,"Well, great so thank you for coming in and I guess you know what I usually ask is Have you ever had what we call us a bio psychosocial assessment before."
13979.0,Patient,"No, I have that."
705.0,Provider,"Most people are like no. So part of what we're doing here is it's more of like a counseling if we were in counseling we would explore we're talking about coping strategies. Today bios like social is more of gathering information to see from the past, what are some things that have occurred and then currently what's going on to get a better picture, where we know how to assist you the best way. Some of the questions is you know, maybe sensitive in nature, this is a safe space confidentiality and privacy are very important. You know ccf if someone called me tomorrow and they're outside of bright hearth health and they said, you know what was the outcome of the assessment, I couldn't confirm or deny that I even met with you or know you. Until you sign a consent form, and we would get that then the okay first from you."
13979.0,Patient,Sure right.
705.0,Provider,"So confidentiality again very important to us, the exceptions, if you know, sometimes if someone's having an emergency we're going to get you the medical help that you need. If you share that you're going to harm somebody we're going to get them the help they need and get you the help that you need if you share you're going to harm yourself we're going to get you the help that you need. Also, a mandated just with adult protective services or child protective services if there's something that's reportable than we do on those and those are the exceptions. Any questions about any that I mentioned are."
13979.0,Patient,"Now i'm a mandated reporter myself, so I get all that stuff."
705.0,Provider,"Okay, so if you don't mind me asking. What what type of work, then, do you do."
13979.0,Patient,"Well, now I am my own studio owner I own a studio with my husband, where the production's film their commercials and you know their TV shows and movies there. So we rent the space out to them. So that's what I do now, but I used to be in social service and work for viva family and children services for 10 years and it's pretty challenging times during my life, it really was so i'm glad i'm out of that that now."
705.0,Provider,"i'm hearing, though, when you share that there was a passion, though, there too, and it was difficult, but yet. You were part of the solution. and supportive while you were there and then it's like my time is up, I don't want to do this anymore."
13979.0,Patient,"yeah it, I found that job to be like a double edged sword you definitely helping people helping their lives, improve and you know you bond with these people you, you want to see him win in life but. Then it, it became a problem where was just draining to me, and it was like rubbing off on me, so I had to get out of it so that's what I did."
705.0,Provider,"yeah i'm glad that you recognize that and was like Okay, and now. Oh that's neat that you were able to go in a different direction now."
13979.0,Patient,yeah totally different so now I don't hear about anybody problems this gold being a commercial and I go about my business so yeah easy peasy.
705.0,Provider,"In the event, those if someone does need support, probably naturally you're there."
13979.0,Patient,"yeah i'm pretty much the family's support person, so I can't escape it."
705.0,Provider,"And that's great and so you are their support person and then it's like how about you, though, if you need a support person who's your support people."
13979.0,Patient,The question. I don't know. we're down now.
705.0,Provider,That can be to CC then is is one of those areas that maybe you explore a little bit more of how to find the support for you.
13979.0,Patient,"yeah that's pretty much while why i'm here I don't really have anybody this like a neutral person that I can go to and. feel that they won't Go and tell the other person, you know, so I really don't have that at all."
705.0,Provider,"i'm glad you're here, and you know. You know if you're thinking about having that person and like I said earlier, with confidentiality, but not only that you really highlighted to. That it's a person that doesn't already have the history with you that may be biased it's just like having that neutral party that you can share what you want to share it and you don't have to edit."
13979.0,Patient,"right they don't have to worry about it getting back to someone else and yeah so that's definitely why why I am here, because I know that I need that and i'm i'm always the person that people come to him till their problems too, and you know but. i'm looked at as having it all together, so they don't see me as having any problems and i'm like that couldn't be the furthest from the truth. is just I don't share them because a like, for instance, like my mom she's she's sick I don't want to worry her she's already got enough issues that she needs to be doing with her. Instead of taking other people's burdens because that's exactly what she'll do, and the same thing with my sister she's that person to if you tell her anything she'll go worrying about it, and she you know she will take it on to too deeply. And I don't want to worry her you know, so I don't really tell them a whole lot because of it. yeah."
705.0,Provider,"i'm again i'm happy to hear that you're here and that part of what you're looking for is to get that support system that you deserve. And that you're like you know what i'm going to try something different, and i'm hoping that CC in the group's most of the time, it is very healing just to know. That you know somebody else is going through some of the same things you're going through or a lot of times it's it's also healthy, just to be there, where that's not me at all I don't relate to that, but i've even grateful for. For where I am today."
13979.0,Patient,"yeah that that absolutely I could save as well, both sides of it."
705.0,Provider,"So it does it gives you, you know that safe space and at least each week you can look for you know forward to coming in and. If you find to that that you know, like earlier, I was meeting with someone, and it was more of depression is more of what her struggle is and so she's finding. Specifically, depression groups or there's enzymatic groups, I mean there's so many different types. That you get that additional support and those people that you're describing where it's just like they don't know you they're not going to go share with anybody they're just going to listen and maybe share what their experiences also."
13979.0,Patient,"huh yeah so i'm kind of like not so sure i'm i'm just being more open as a person to just kind of see how this goes, because I do have some reservations about the group being that. i'm sometimes i'm the type of person that taken on hearing in noticing other people problems I could take it on because i'm. A little too transparent so i'm working on that and I don't know if the group will affect me in a negative way, which is hearing other people's problems and how it would affect me."
705.0,Provider,If that makes any sense so.
13979.0,Patient,"i'm kind of i'm just like okay i'm going to see how everything goes and just give it a trial run and see if it's for me it's not, this is not, but if it if it is okay great so i'm just being open and we'll see how things go."
705.0,Provider,"Okay yeah I think that again that that's a something definitely to evaluate as you go along and then being able, just to if that's how you're feeling to see there's other groups, and sometimes you know other groups. Just different dynamics is some groups, you know it just depends. On maybe the dynamics of that group, if you feel like that that's how it is and you don't relate as much going into maybe a different time and there's different Members sometimes to the group dynamics will even shift, because you get maybe new people or it just a lot of factors. But no yeah but it's you know I mean, I think that that's definitely something where it's just like Okay, how is this going to affect me and if i'm hearing certain things, every day, am I going to take that internally. Keep the lines of communication open, let us know and again if it's not matching your needs at the time, then you could be like okay I you know, maybe something else and we'll go from there."
13979.0,Patient,"Okay, fair enough."
705.0,Provider,Right now to current city and state that you live in.
13979.0,Patient,i'm in Santa clarita well the it's probably going to come up as Canyon country California.
705.0,Provider,And who do you live with right now and Canyon country are with.
13979.0,Patient,yeah my husband and two kids.
705.0,Provider,"And i'm reading, you might see me look to the left or to the right and it's just reading the guidelines of questions here. I also CC, thank you for prior to us meeting you all so phil Dr history question here, so I do have some of that with me, so thank you so much, and it looks like to the one of the reasons, as you described was having that support group, and is it both panic and anxiety attacks."
13979.0,Patient,"yeah um they've been getting so much better now i'm really happy that they've kind of been like selling down to the point where it's very manageable it's getting more manageable I should say. They it started a while back when I got stuck in traffic like on this very, very busy freeway was an accident up ahead. And what they did was they completely closed the freeway so um I was on there for like 40 Minutes it was dark in California it's like a lot of mountains so. Basically I was behind between like mountains, and it was just cars everywhere and i've never liked the idea of being like in a space where there's where I can't go anywhere and that started it, so I had a real meltdown for 40 minutes on a freeway and since then its. place was losing my mind i'm driving and I see traffic is slow slowing down is. Heavy you know it makes me feel panicky like it's gonna happen again because i'm like oh I don't want that to happen again, but it's slowly well what i've been doing, because I use essential oils now when I use a little. it's not a lavender is yeah lavender that's my favorite. lavender oil and I put that. In the it's like this little diffuser thing for the car. And it just kind of gives you a nice little spurt of that as you're driving and when you put the air on so i've been driving with that now and it's really because. I have to use it before it turns into a panic attack, because if it's a panic that it's not going to help me so it's our it's like that. thing that I use in my car I take it, I got some in my personal that if somebody else's car I have it, and I could smell it and just kind of relax so that has been helping me tremendously because I knew when it happened, I wasn't gonna stop drive and I have to drive and get around. So I wasn't gonna let that deter me, but it was just been that that fear fulfilling of getting back in the car uncertain Oh, what if it happens again what if it happens again. You know, so that was really my main main issue with panic surrounding anything driving traffic heavy traffic trucks and stuff all around me. So, and then having like. Because i'm around so many mountains and it's ironic because Santa clarita here is nothing but mountains and I don't know why, but I don't really like mountains."
705.0,Provider,Okay.
13979.0,Patient,"I just I can't explain it I don't like them, they look like. they're dirty there's stuff, on the other side that I that is blocking my view from things i'm like I don't know what's, on the other side of a mountain, it could be something we're so in my mind is mountains, is this the thing that kind of freaks me out I don't like them. I don't know I just don't like them and to be caught between two of them like that it just really just amplified my brain sansi told you, we didn't like mountains that's why this is what happens you caught between them now so yeah. that's where i'm at."
705.0,Provider,"And not right there is tons of self awareness. And what I have to say with cognitive behavioral therapy and having to reframe because the closer you knew how to identify it you're like yes it's the mountains, I see them as Sturdy, I see them as this i'm caught in between them. Is there a way and it might not be today. But starting to think is there a way to shift how you view those mountains."
13979.0,Patient,"yeah that's what i've been working on trying to figure out a way to just become one with the mountain i'm probably gonna have to just surrender to the mountain in some way and stop thinking that it's sad. yeah that's I just haven't gotten there, yet my there's a mountain like right there when I look out my door I could see him out. And I don't go nowhere near the mountain because i'm like okay there's another mountain. it's it's new to me too well it's not really it shouldn't be new because i've been in cali now for over 10 years. But born and raised in Chicago you'll never see a mountain there's no mountains nowhere, so I guess when I came out here was such a new experience these mountains and how. Their streets hanging off the side of the mountain and one false move and you're off the side of the mountain and it's just like a weird and different dynamic, from what I was born and raised and used to. So I didn't know I didn't like mountains until I moved out here with them out. So yeah I, I know I need to get more acquainted with the mountains and try to figure out why I feel this way about a movie. And then maybe I can relieve some of the anxiety surrounding the mountains, but that's just where I am now."
705.0,Provider,"Absolutely having to wear again, sometimes I call more core beliefs, our scripts as they develop in time and it usually starts in childhood and then how how we navigate through the world is through like. Looking at that lens and it's how we. Think about ourselves how we think about others how we think, maybe even globally and until like counseling or some other type of like I even know what the think job coaching and things like that or life coaching. Is you start to see where the core belief developed and then how to start to shift where it's like Okay, you know if this is internally what i'm feeling, how can I shift this."
13979.0,Patient,Right yeah.
705.0,Provider,"yeah and coming from you were saying you grew up, it was it Chicago. It makes sense, then, for you CC that he seeing the mountains wasn't something that maybe when you were younger and you took comfort and what was it skyscrapers or."
13979.0,Patient,"trees big buildings i'm comfortable around like the city life. Yes, mountains kind of feel remote to me like you're in the middle of nowhere. And I think subconsciously my mind, is always say will if you're in the middle of nowhere if you ever need help, are you going to get help, so it kind of plays this scary script in my mind of oh you're in the middle of nowhere there's mountains here. And I noticed normally not that's not so much the case Sometimes it is because there are parts of La that i've been sort of so remote that oh no I really had a meltdown there because I don't like it at all, I like to be. i'm a city Gal I just I like city things I like city living, and this is kind of opposite of what I grew up with."
705.0,Provider,"right and as you're explaining each of those pieces it's like yes, I could see where. You take where all that is very comforting and then now you get into, especially if we have moments where it produces that anxiety and you're pairing it with driving and now with the mountains you start to already associate probably before you even get in the car if you're going somewhere. The technique that you're using though with having the aroma therapy is beautiful like something like that can start to help I call it retraining the brain."
13979.0,Patient,mm hmm.
705.0,Provider,"here's the anxiousness we already created that pathway now you're taking a detour where it's like wait a minute, now we have the aroma therapy and we're going to be able to see if even instead of a 10 if you could knock down inside it to a nine. i'm going i'm like i'll take a night, not a new yeah."
13979.0,Patient,yeah that's a win.
705.0,Provider,"Is. My appreciate you sharing that too, because it is focusing on what is a win. And so, each time that you're able to just get in the car that's a win if you're able to drive yourself somewhere that's when. Having the knowledge to if you're really thinking that reflecting back on childhood and where you feel comfortable and you know, like bigger scope of not maybe today, but in the future of where you would maybe want to live if it's not with the mountains."
13979.0,Patient,yeah. Definitely not with the mountains prefer the beach.
705.0,Provider,"yeah exactly, and you know with the beach and I live in California to there's a lot of places that either are on the feature I can't get near the on the beach because that's a little pricey but near."
13979.0,Patient,yeah.
705.0,Provider,"It is taken a like a review of Okay, is this where I want to be long term and then some of it is just managing day by day, where okay here's where i'm at today. Like you were saying, especially if you live a little bit more remote is is getting in the car, because you want to go and do things."
13979.0,Patient,Absolutely.
705.0,Provider,mm hmm. Any visualization you do like before you get in the car.
13979.0,Patient,"Sometimes um well most of my visit visual ization lies within when I do my meditation every afternoon I do almost supporting minute meditation guided by i'm either going to do, Dr Joe dispenser meditation well that's heavy visualizing. cleaning out all your negativity from all your chakras or I do one from I usually do one of my own that I created as well to this is more like focusing on my breathing and stuff. Like the spins a one best because it seems to be most effective because it's a lot of work of just seeing anything that is basically negative and your sales just kind of disappearing. And because I used to go about it the other way around, and visualize certain me means having like driving in a car happy and all that stuff but that it worked out well, for me it kind of was like it was putting too much attention on a problem."
705.0,Provider,mm hmm.
13979.0,Patient,And so I find that going if i'm happy if i'm if all my skills are clean and i'm home then there's no room for anxiety because anxiety can't live in that environment so it's coming around it the other way that is more it's been more effective effective for me.
705.0,Provider,And just that alone figuring out that piece sometimes people spend months and therapy trying to figure that.
13979.0,Patient,"out, but you know it took a long time to figure that out. yeah."
705.0,Provider,"yeah but we talked about the wins earlier, that is, in itself, a huge win that makes such a big difference of when you know, a coping strategy. will work for you and say Okay, this is my go to and having to on some certain to it, like you were saying like if your emotion is maybe happy, or maybe if you're that day more sad. worn up in that too, and not trying to get us where if we're sad, you can accept the feelings and be like give yourself permission to go through that."
13979.0,Patient,"And then works for you, better that day. yeah absolutely yeah because I used to always think that if there was if I felt sad or anything like that I, that was not a good feeling hurry up and get through it and now it's kind of like Okay, I do allow myself. To maybe feel down Sundays to maybe feel less energetic. You know and and I I surrender to it now and and I don't view it as necessarily bad because it's not it's not plausible to think you're going to be at a 10 every day and leave this happy cheer all day all the time it's you know not plausible but. So I do I do allow myself things now I feel like i'm just tired, then I go rest my brain I go lay down and take a rest."
705.0,Provider,"Part of two, I think, especially with anxiety is having saw those it's almost like the relaxation techniques, like the daily meditations that in the event someone something does come up that since it provoking as you've already set yourself, you know where you're doing the meditation. That again lower level."
13979.0,Patient,mm hmm.
705.0,Provider,It sure sounds like CC you're already like off to a running start rehab. Only things that you're already incorporating.
13979.0,Patient,yeah I think i'm off to a good start. By just don't know if it's something else out there that i'm missing that I can incorporate that all like make my progress even faster.
705.0,Provider,"yeah it can be to them as you've developed some of these coping strategies is coming to where where this is to the forefront. giving you more motivation to expand on those and it's like Okay, you know, this is what i'm doing where it's hard sometimes if you're on your own and you're out there and then life and you're juggling all this. Where this gives you that time were like Oh, this is this time that i'm going to focus all my time and energy on and to see. How what else is there out there, because you already know that different strategies have worked for you it's just about making it more of your style not someone else's and your own language that you like."
13979.0,Patient,You I absolutely.
705.0,Provider,"there's so many great self help books, I mean i'm like all about reading self help books."
13979.0,Patient,me too me too I love them.
705.0,Provider,"That flip side of that is understanding that sometimes it's not in my language, where it's like I can't pronounce that word I don't. Like i'm going to be. In the time that I need it and then being able to say Okay, thank you for that information. that's not a match, but I do see where this is the right track."
13979.0,Patient,"yeah absolutely yeah and even if it's not a match for me I usually can find something to take away from it, maybe it'll remind me of something something else that I just totally forgot, because this I went to a harmonic a. Monday and. it's huge Chamber getting their daughters music and sound the lights and everything and you're in there for an hour and it's supposed to reset your central nervous system and take you back to. felt like I was in my mother's womb, and again it was just so comforting and beautiful and I loved it and then the guy tells me he's like yeah so you feel protected like you know your energy field is protected. And he was telling me about how he do certain meditations to protect his energy feels that he's not taking in like. The troubles of the world, because I was telling them how you know just really is just i'm just getting so sick of all the suspects nation closures, and all this crazy world I just don't like it. And he reminded me of, then I said, you know I do a meditation to kind of protect myself from the craziness of the world and said I don't know what is that for doing that I forgot about it. And then I realized in that moment, I said, well, maybe, maybe i'm having this conversation with you because I needed to be reminded, to to do that again because they was working for me and I couldn't for the life of me figure out why I had stopped doing it or. I couldn't figure it out, so when he reminded me of that that's okay that's what I needed to know and so. i've been incorporating now taking a little time to just make sure that I feel that i'm protected before I go out into the crazy crazy world and have to do with all this craziness that's going on."
705.0,Provider,"What a neat experience and you're absolutely right, where as humans, we forget about those things that make us feel so good it's what's important is we're resourceful and we know we have somewhere in our in our memory bank. that's right Okay, and it does take sometimes that person to bring it out to say Okay, you know, have you ever or do you remember when and you're like I did I don't know why I quit that and then a dream and you reengage."
13979.0,Patient,"yeah yeah i'm so happy he reminded me of that because that's probably a missing piece, and I need to get back to that I really do."
705.0,Provider,"It draws you closer like you were saying with the security, then, is feeling safe before maybe you're in the car you're going to see somebody or whatever it may be."
13979.0,Patient,"Exactly hey to feel safe, even when I when i'm leaving my house then i'll know that i'm protected. yeah."
705.0,Provider,"And this is really you know with the pandemic, a lot of people with anxiety panic attack that this is increased."
13979.0,Patient,"Absolutely yeah because we all feel like what's going to happen, you know we don't know what this world is. What the new normal is going to be and not been able to see people that that really hurt me a lot not being able to see my friends and my family. And just kind of being cooped up in the House, that was a very, very challenging time for me, even though now things are kind of open. i'm still not really comfortable like doing the things I used to do my circle was even smaller now because i'm not going to go out to. A bar and be dancing and stuff with strangers and people I don't know I don't know what they have I don't want them that close to me i'm just not comfortable with it, I haven't been to a concert. No large events, and I do miss it, I really do as much as I want to go see bill Burke last weekend I was like i'm going there is going to be 20,000 people there is. No, I love beer bar I love concerts but. I just don't do it so it's part of me i'm that part gets me so down because I used to love the I still would love to do things like that again but i'm not going to risk my safety to do it."
705.0,Provider,"And that's where it is, it is like taking a look at it, of pros and cons, you know, is it worth the risk and we've had a lot of unknowns and so now we're finding out more. Even with that CC is would it change because it doesn't change for everybody, we have our preferences of where we feel safe right now of what's happening it's outdoors if it was an outdoor small concert would that be something where you were comfortable with or not."
13979.0,Patient,"yeah I will be comfortable more outdoors and I will be definitely more comfortable if they. Do social distance and a lot of these places cuz like I saw bill Barbie for the pandemic and literally the guy next to me was like right here like on an airplane i'm just like this is too much and they said that. He had almost sold out, so I knew it was going to be like the same thing and i'm the i'm not comfortable with that, but. If it were outdoors and they were so close because a lot of things, for some reason comedians some comedy shows that you know they want to pack, a man so they're putting you really in close quarters, with one another. And even if it was outdoors. And in close quarters, I would not be comfortable with that only. I would be comfortable if there were if we were outdoors and space they're going to put his table over there are table here and we had some room I could I could deal with it because I have been out since then to comedy show, and it was. Literally I say 20 people in this in this room in the room held like 200 so everybody was like way over their way over there. And I kind of knew going in it wasn't going to be that many people, because the promoter had told me he says not nothing going on in here you'll be fine and Sure enough, there was nobody early in here and I loved it. But now that everybody's back to being wide open, they are wide open and they are not try to social distance, so I was like yes, that part of my life is not gonna be happening anymore."
705.0,Provider,"It is an adjustment and it is still now you have that experience and you're right people are coming back and some of those places are getting packed and then it's back to. Your decision making is okay, is my comfort here, and if it's not there today being like okay it's not here today is there hope, though, that maybe this could you know, in the future change, just like it's already you know shifting in some areas."
13979.0,Patient,"Right i'm hoping so as of today, what they're doing no i'm not comfortable, but maybe. down the line, who knows. we'll see."
705.0,Provider,"that's me too i'm very grateful that i'm remote i'm also mindful that I have to get out and see people and connect because that too is not healthy and to new type of balance for for me, and I know when I talk to people every day they're like everyone is having their. Their realization that okay appreciating what you've been through appreciating what the world's been through and appreciating how different people handle it different and that we each have different comfort levels, and I think that's the big one, you know it's. ass no mask it, you know, like you were saying the spacing of the table some people like it, some people don't."
13979.0,Patient,"yeah and it's so like you said everybody has their own different preference, because my for me when I run the studio lot of these productions they don't wear a mask and I always have my mask on me and my husband. Because we've agreed that. It doesn't matter I don't care if you got 10 shots I don't want you that close to me because I know you can still get it, you can still give it so i'm just so uncomfortable. But is still a great group of people out there, that that feels like when they're talking to you, they have to be right here, why do you have to be right here, you know you don't I can hear you. I promise you I can't hear you if you're six feet away, I promise direct near you so a lot of times I spend my my day like if someone because what I do is I open a studio my offices in the back. So they don't necessarily i'm not necessarily in their in their area there on the floor, but they will come to me if they have a question about something so, then I come on to the floor. And, like the other day yesterday as a woman now she's not wearing a mask she she has an owner, but it's down. And she's talking to me and she's all getting into a conversation and as she's coming in closer to me i'm back in a way, because she's getting closer and closer and i'm like Okay, I can hear you. And you could tell she's just a person that likes to be close to people and that would have been fine and duty with me, I used to be that but it's made me so distant now that. i'm i'm constantly like I ran away from this lady I went behind the counter so she so it could be space between us that's how I had the wind up getting away from her because. If she's talking she's moving in closer and i'm just moving away so I just okay i'm an account because she can't come over that way. And it made me realize that. Man it's. it's changed me, although I used to be a teen Asian clients that have them in my office and we talk and I learned more about them and stuff and now. I don't let anybody in there hartley I don't invite them and I don't really try to talk to them anymore and it's sad because I do miss that part I do miss the part of knowing my clients and being able to connect with them more but i'm just not comfortable i'm just not."
705.0,Provider,"Yes to that circle of control, have you seen the picture, where it has a circle of control, it has to do, like what we have direct control over what we're influenced, and we have no control over."
13979.0,Patient,"No, I haven't."
705.0,Provider,"Do you mind if I send it to your email. Sure, I like it, because it really can help put back to just like what you were talking about where. You made the choice to wear your mask so that's having that self control. We can influence others by a few move away. However, how they're going to respond. and getting it like you know just like with what we don't have control over such as. la traffic. You know. Getting just those different levels where you're like okay is every day, is trying to see. You take in all of it, I know for some it's like people are limiting how much social media or how much news they're listening to or whatever it may be that's just adding to their stress."
13979.0,Patient,mm hmm absolutely.
705.0,Provider,"But just developing again I believe what today is like for you as you navigate through as you continue to try to get out there and to work, and it is back to your comfort zone, and that can change in time, one way or the other, depending on experience."
13979.0,Patient,"yeah and my comfort i'm not I wouldn't call myself foot energy reader or anything like that, but I do, I do have a keener sense of energy that I could kind of feel the vibe of people than most people just simply don't, but I do, and if I feel like. it's hard to explain except if I feel like i'm not feeling your energy, I definitely want you to stay away from me, because I don't trust you I kind of feel like you're a reckless person to me and it's. When I say reckless I don't mean it in a negative way I just mean it in a way, where you don't think the virus is real you don't care about it and you don't take precautions. is like a kind of. pick up on that energy of certain people and that woman for sure I was like no she's out there she's party No, I do not want you near me but it's been some instances where I feel very safe with. Certain people because they just have this this energy, I could feel the energy that they're not that person and I felt safe with them not safe enough to. Just hang out without a mask or anything but because I only do that with my friends that I know that. They don't hang out like that, and that they will tell me if they had a sneeze or cough or anything, they will be totally honest with me and I could trust them. that's what i'm comfortable with, but it has been some instances, that I could think of where people have been around me and I haven't been so like to get away get away because their energy is different. So yeah i'm i'm hoping that this will and i've gotten a lot better because i'm telling you when it first went down when my husband was going to the grocery store i'd be like hey you've been out there, no, no, get away and he's like i'm your host. And I was just kind of like no I saw you go out there and I don't want you hear me now and I had to really work on just kind of relaxing and but not being to relax to where. I just totally got my guard down and i'm just hanging out with people and stuff so yeah cuz my daughter, one of my daughter she don't leave the House now. she's 21 she goes to school online and she probably since the pandemic happen she's probably left the House twice because. I literally listen, no, you need to get this House you hear all the time she's 10 times worse than me and i'm really concerned i'm gonna say i'm worried about her because I don't want to like worry about my kids but concern that she is taking it way too too far and that she. may never get a husband or anything because she's just turned into like this. don't be around people show it. And like I don't know how you're gonna find a husband just sitting here, and you will mold and I don't know i'm just stolen shells name don't worry about me i'm going to be fine so. um so yeah i've worked a lot on just trying to just not be so uptight about. When he leaves the House because he was the one going to the store and then, little by little, I started kind of going with him and then, little by little, I just started accepting the fact that you will you know what. There is something going around the world, and you know what if I get it i'm just gonna deal with it, but I don't want fear to control my life i'm not gonna allow it."
705.0,Provider,"Right exactly and just having that mindset where you're like okay i'm going to name it, as they say, I read this one.

Then we're we're then we contain that we're we're able to manage I love that part is just like yes call it fear, because most people are so afraid of it and it grows power. In here. And you're also experience now is different than your your daughter's where your daughter is really taking it in a different way. Where she's isolating more and like you were saying that's not a healthy balance either, and is trying to strike back to how do we create balance and such extreme unknowns."
