So when my mom got pregnant with me, she was 27 and. She I guess she wasn't with my dad my dad was married. So they found out that she was pregnant with me and my twin brother and he gave her the money to have an abortion and so he didn't want us, you know he. So obviously she didn't have it, but he never came around I didn't know him I don't even have his last name, so it was really hard for me like growing up because there's eight of us and six of us are sets of twins. But we have different dads. So they all have the dads last names and then, but I have my younger brothers that's last name. Because when my mom was pregnant with us. She got with him, so we got his last name, so I was always like what's my real last name she's like ladies yeah I think i'm like no my like what is it you know, want to know my dad. So he's had these issues of like, why do they know who their dad is, why do they know their last names, you know, but we don't and. Then she finally told me when I was 21 and I found out within a week. And I guess, he is crazy, it was a crazy story, because the guy that my kid's dad. That I married really young his stepdad we would always because I want to go live with them when I was young and. Like I got married really, and so we would always drop a step that off to his job, which is about 15 minutes away and we would always drop them off pick up jump off the cliff and he worked at this big like welding company and. When I found my dad he was like yeah I work here, or whatever, and I was like oh my God i'm like I be looking for you, for years. Not knowing that you know you work there, and I was like do you know this guy named this he's like yeah my friend, I was like so we not have not only been going to this job all these years we've been going to the very plant that he works at. He very well could have been walking in front of the car and i'm. Dealing with these nice where's my dad he's right there and he's saying by to him, you know, and I don't know what that looks like or. You know anything's I didn't know who he was. And I was just like yeah you know this guy is you know my kids grandpa and he's like oh my God this my friend, we work together, all these years, and I was like we've been dropping them off pick you up all these years, you know it, it was just like a crazy feeling but. I kind of like the reaching out for about the first year and then I kind of got this feeling of like. I want to see what happens if I don't call you know because I am the one that reached out and and always go over there and then. He just never called never called again, you know, so I was like okay well I got my closer I I found who he was I you know I asked him why he wasn't there you know. Even though, like he just talked bad about my mom and my mom never spoke, you know in 21 years she never said anything bad about him. In like 10 minutes he tried to like. Talk bad about her as much as he could, and I was like I know your wife is right here, but you don't have to do that my mom didn't. Do that my whole life, you know she was just like I don't know I don't know I don't know he didn't want to be there, you know, but he was like your mom was a how she knew I was married I was like you knew, you were married to you know, like. it's just crazy the like the stuff you were saying he's like she's fat and i'm like for one a mom she's not small but she's not fat but it's crazy because he's about the same as her so I was just kind of like, why are you. saying all these things you know."
252.0,Provider,My thing.
14837.0,Patient,"yeah and I don't know I just kind of afterwards I just kind of like realized, maybe that's why my mom didn't really talk about him, you know, like he wasn't nice yeah anyway so. that's a story about my dad and him not being around but there's eight of US my oldest brother, he has the same dad is my. Two older sisters that which are twins so, then we have the same dad and then, I have one older brother that's like two years older than me he has a dad and then me and my twin brother have a dad. And then my little brother habitat. So yeah."
252.0,Provider,"Okay, totally get it. yeah and I just want to throw back to your biological dad. yeah you know when they want to do nothing but talk about a woman like it's her fault is his marriage is phones."
14837.0,Patient,"yeah yeah and it's crazy, because when I found the address IP like $7. To like the white pages and they gave me all this information, and so I wrote to the last address and. I sent pictures and everything and then I got a call like a week later, and this guy was like hey you know, I was really nervous to do this, but he's like I guess i'm your brother and he's like you know we always kind of knew about you guys, but that always. You know, always like denied you guys or whatever like denied having you guys are knowing you guys he's like but me and I guess, I have two older brothers. And he's like we would always walk past this bar and we would always wonder like what we're doing they're like why dad was so curious about this bar my mom used to work at this bar. With her boyfriend. And so he's like and she you know she worked there for many years until I was 21."
252.0,Provider,mm hmm.
14837.0,Patient,"You know 2122 and then so he's like yeah I was again it's my mom's you know my mom's old job or whatever he said yeah we didn't know we were just like what are we doing here, you know, and so you spy on them, I guess. I was like Oh, I want to know him and he's like you didn't miss much he's like he didn't really raise us either, then he left my he's like he left our mom for someone else and. So it's kind of like okay Well he didn't raise the older ones who didn't raise us but I guess he he raised, I have a younger brother and sister, and he raised them. So. yeah."
252.0,Provider,that's kind of amazing in it.
14837.0,Patient,"yeah and then. They live, you know 2030 minutes away and I don't know ever requested i'm on Facebook and stuff but he hasn't brought text him and I don't get a reply."
252.0,Provider,"wow. he's too busy. OK, the next question, and this is the last question. Okay, it was really best. Tell me about your education experience and were you bullied in school, did you have any kind of learning disability just graduated high school or college just kind of."
14837.0,Patient,"We were bullied I wasn't believed um I don't have any disabilities, although I hate school and then, when I read something i'm like what did I just read and then redo it I don't know I think it's because i'm not interested. But my senior okay so was it as soon as I sport I got really bad like I became bad like cutting school lot, so my mom sent me to a Salvadoran to study for two years and then, when I came back, I guess, their studies. Over there boy advance so when I came back, I was an honor rooms and stuff so and I already like the stuff that they were learning out here, I had already learned. So they had put me back to my my grade or whatever, and I went to school and everything but I went to. what's it called like. Half day schools. So I went to one of those and then my senior year I went up to like the very last like two days of school, but I didn't have my full credit setting graduate and then I got pregnant with my son. So I kind of just started like working and stuff. But after I had my second son, I was 20. I went back to school and I knew I wanted to get my my diploma and I just my God. So I went back to school and I got it I got my my diploma and then like five years ago, I was enrolled in college to become a social worker. So I did that, for almost a year. They cut off my financial aid because they're like Oh, you only missed three days in a semester, and I didn't miss the three days, if I missed two, but one of the days I was like 10 minutes late. and So I was 10 minutes late and they put me as absolute so they were like you have to pay a whole semester, on your own, and this has been hard so I haven't gone back. And again, like growing up, we weren't we weren't bullied but I was always really shy, and I think it's because there was so many of my siblings and so when we would shop. For new clothes, it would always be at like the Salvation Army, instead of like hand me down clothes so it's already. done you. And then, what but my two older sisters so by the time I got it was like you know I just I think I always had always had companies like self confidence. yeah so I was never like really like out there right, I was very like just close that and shy. To ask for."
252.0,Provider,"And and. I think it's amazing that you went back and finished high school tell me how you like to going over for to El Salvador, for two years and studying over there."
14837.0,Patient,"Are hated it she sent me to military school yeah and I was the only girl that was interned there. I don't know if this is like appropriate to say or whatever, but so I was the only girl that was interning there, I was 12. Like 1213 and. I ended up having like relations with one of the younger lieutenant 22 or 23. You know, and I get at the time in my mind, I was a kid so I did those it was that wrong, you know, and my mom came in and stormed up the school was like who's a pervert that you know I can my daughter like she like shut the school down, and it goes horrible you know, for me, I was embarrassed. You know. um so I guess the guy got fired but then one thing I never told my mom is that the you know because I was left there Monday through Friday, and so the, though. The people won't charge like one of the people that would stay like three of the days would be the principal of the school. And like he was married heroes have his wife there and just keep there, but on my birthday one day. There was another girl that was staying at this you got in trouble with sheila hey we're going to go drink, I was like Okay, and I was like i'm gonna go with you, so you know, like with us so there's nothing wrong with it, you know i'm going to go with this girl that's my friend, you know. And then. I just remember that, like, I was kind of lacking mortar her because she was like very freely talking to the the. The lieutenant, which is a principal, the main one and but they kept panning me like these big by. 16 ounce cups of alcohol and it was my first time drinking, but I know they said they can't. Like handing me different things like something dark something like something dark it's a big light here's a shot of this and then they were like here's a cup of wine, you know, I was like oh God like this stuff you know, so I blacked out. And when I woke up. The principal was on top of me, and I think you should have raised me, but like I pushed him off and I just cried and cried and he's like i'm sorry and he's like you, you wanted me to it, I was like no I didn't like I might be blacked out, but you know. You know, and so that it like in China really was like always stuck in my head, and I think. A lot of these things that have happened to me are big reason of why I don't trust people with my kids. You don't people it's supposed to be helping watch him, and you know 44 of my family members to me, you know and i'm like people that are supposed to be the supposed to be able to trust you know. yeah serve a lot of trust issues yeah right."
252.0,Provider,"Well, it makes perfect sense if you really think about it, you know, and of course that's exact exact result of the things that you've experienced you know what you've been taught is that the people that are supposed to keep you safe can't and don't. And they take advantage of that."
14837.0,Patient,yeah.
252.0,Provider,"You know, and so, of course, because trust issues. yeah between you and me, I am glad your mom said that's for them."

14837.0,Patient,"yeah yeah I didn't think about it at the time, but as I grew older and I became a mom I became a parent I was like oh that's why she was bad you know that's what it feels like to be raging with a you know. anger is. Safety you know I get it. yeah yeah."
252.0,Provider,"I mean, but. Not at all."
14837.0,Patient,"Now that I have a 15 year old and a 13 year old and a five year old i'm like oh no, you know."
