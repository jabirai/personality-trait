She has represented to the virtual clinic and. i'm waiting for her to join."
15670.0,Patient,"hi. I know I was I didn't touch anything I think I don't know we just connected the line. I don't know. I think it was like I don't know because I didn't touch the screen it just like ended, I mean."
498.0,Provider,"Oh, I don't know what happened was I didn't see you in the waiting room I salvia and then I was looking for you. But I didn't see any who i'm so glad that you reconnected and you presented to the virtual playing, so this is what I wanted to talk to you about so I understand that it looks like you had your experience like to. To. Like Sentinel intervention recently, I know that you reported today that you were incarcerated i'm sorry to hear that but i'm glad that you got out but it looks like you were. looks like you were concerned with like a domestic violence dispute, and then the week before and you were experiencing like some concern with regard to being by yourself talk to me about. talk to me about what's going on, like at home with you, are you okay."
15670.0,Patient,"I don't think so i'm trying I don't know how to manage the situation because I obviously i'm very grateful to be out of there like we're not where I was and yeah there was issues with my partnership that I was in I was because we were living together. And so I. I am on my own now i've been back, but it was like so traumatic and I was so close I was so scared I wasn't going to be able to get out because, like no one had the money or the resources and it was. And I was like just thinking in my head how am I going to fight this where, am I going to live what am I going to do you know. and Oh yeah but anyways i'm out now and i'm trying to like just manage everything and figure out where i'm going to stay what i'm going to do, like where i'm going to live like my family told me to like obviously like. it's not a good idea to contact that person like again, even though they're contacting me i'm trying to avoid it but i'm also. trying to find this place is like resources which I got some from. what's her name forgot her name i'm. yeah the one that was in our group, she talked to me. yeah I think they sent me some resources. I just like I. I don't know what to do a guy I think i'm scared to take the resources, I see like I know I have that. And I just need to make the phone call but i'm just like I feel so stuck and I feel like I don't I don't know what i'm going to do, and that and then on top of that it's just like. Like the medication and everything and then like it's just like and then I have somebody else one of my that moved in here. But then, because I needed someone to pay the rent but then you know turns out she didn't have the financial stuff either and she's dealing with her problems it's affecting me, so I don't know I don't know what to do."
498.0,Provider,Okay okay um. This is tough because it's like a compounding situation you're trying to juggle so much on top of like making the best decisions with regard to yourself.
15670.0,Patient,"yeah and then you know I have somebody else who's asking me for help and, like other other people, and like I can't. do that because I feel drained completely drained out of myself I just got out of like a really traumatic situation, and people are expecting things for me and I like i'm not able and i'm not like I yeah i'm not able to to do it. Okay, even working at a job is like I mean I i'm trying to apply for jobs, but just like i'm trying to manage everything and it's getting hard and then the medication thing takes so much time and energy like I. yeah."
498.0,Provider,"yeah and that's kind of what I wanted to talk to you about I think. I know why you missed your group with Dr practice last week. You know you're kind of on like every four day. Like medication allotment and so you had a few. What is qualified or what is characterized as early refill requests even. Even though we've discussed those instances of like you know you just calling it early in order to like mitigate like the delay. Between the therapy and not the therapy, but between like the pharmacy refill time in the distribution just kind of so it would it would it wouldn't put you in a position to where you had to go without for the pharmacy But even with that said. Missing Dr packers group last week it it just put you in a space where for at least for now. That the stimulant there might not be best for you just because it does require such like frequent presentation and then on top of that, with you have like the history of the misuse. It may be a better strategy to go with something that I can prescribe more long term that where you can continue to present you know for effective management with Dr pachter. But then maybe a strategic or something along those lines where you could have like a full month of black so that you don't have to be concerned about like the interim. management with regard to the medication because that's something that I could prescribe more long time it won't require every four days you know. We do a month dosage it still has a stimulative effect but it's not a stimulant you know, by definition, and so that way you could be more. That way, you could go back to something that's a lot it, you know, once the month I was still. want you to check in frequently so that we can see if it's effective so that I can you know check in on your mood and how you're progressing along, but the stimulant of therapy just seems to be placing. demands on the on you, on top of everything else that you're managing you know the frequent check ins you're doing great with me you're doing great with Dr pachter i'd still love for you to do those groups, but at least, I think. In the back of your mind you won't be so confirm where is my medication, was it called in, is it going to be ready, because I think that's giving you another. level of heightened anxiety and concerned on top of like the interrelationship thing that you have going on, you know your place to stay. So what do you think about a bare minimum pursuing that because at this at this about it It just seems like it's making it seems like it's making your treatment plan more difficult for you then. Then I would honestly like it to be. I don't want I don't want to be. yeah I don't want like something that you feel like. You know something else that you're worried about."
15670.0,Patient,"yeah yeah. And I like cake i'm only worried just because, like i'm like is there cuz is there, like a prescription that could because i've been taking it for a while now and i've taken it like I said in the past, before, and in some ways it's so effective and, in some ways. i'm just wondering like if there is something better, or as effective, I of course i'm going to take the opportunity. yeah cuz I know like I just when it comes to just like losing my stuff or like. I don't know when i'm not on it i'm so much more distract i'm just so much more like my stuff is everywhere, like like my. Like i'm so this so much disorganization and then I forget my video what i'm saying it's like it's yeah."
498.0,Provider,"yeah I totally get it, I mean you're not the not the only person who suffers look like those components of you know distractibility you know the memory loss the forgetfulness that inattentiveness but strattera was designed. You know. not specifically with nami but it's shown like some real. Some real benefit to people who suffered will adults specifically who suffer from attention deficit disorder. it's not it's not something that's going to work as quickly as after all it's not going to work today you're going to fill it today, but it does provide you with some benefit. That is an option. will be a trend is another option and it's just that, like I said, there are some other options for you to consider, aside from. You know the adderall which which, at least for now with with most recently missing Dr packers. Group. It kind of puts you in a in a it kind of puts you in a difficult place where you know I can document you know your willingness to come come to group your attendance and submitted."
15670.0,Patient,"I was. I was like really freaked out when I missed the group I was like. And I think it was also the stuff that was affecting me around me like my you know, like situation of other people were affecting. I realized I missed in and I, you know, I was like really I felt really I yeah I guess it just it just happened like."
498.0,Provider,"That and again it's not it's not I don't want it to seem like it's not it's it's not punishment, but it is to deter you from missing group because because we we meet the frequent check ins, to know that you're managing things effectively The goal is not. to withhold medication from you. And I know that a lot of patients perceive it as that way, but when you are juggling. Previous misuse and abuse of like a history we don't want to revert you back to that with any of the treatment plans that we provide. On the contrary, we actually want to provide you with the most efficient treatment while also supporting like the continuation of the journey with regard to both. Historical misuse and attention you know attention difficulties so that's recommendations for now would be to provide you something that's not going to. be difficult for you to acquire a long term deal provide you with some assistance with regard to like attention deficit and then get you back into like. Regular regular tennis with Dr pachter continued progress along with me and then we'll make changes, where we see you know fit to make changes. But I just didn't wonderful number one I didn't want you to wonder like what's going on with the treatment plan and I wouldn't just call it something for you. Without discussing it with you first and getting your authorization and support within to kind of make a determination of whether or not. This is a strategy that you feel like you can support and it's it's something that you want to consider and if if okay if we move forward in this direction, so I can collaborate after a bit."
15670.0,Patient,"Because it is my my. Water activity i'm like like my the way i'm hyper and the way, like, I mean like. I like i've seen I just like I could I could see the changes in myself that, like the medication is doing for me and have it in like I could see the way I was before. or, in some ways, and obviously some ways they're they're really positive like the mix is really positive, especially when it. comes to just like remaining calm and relaxed and like like handling the situation like not being so you know i'm saying and i'm i'm just really scared of. Going back to that and exerting so much energy and being hyper again, and you know what i'm saying like yeah."
498.0,Provider,"yeah, this is not, this is not a recommendation to not treat it at all it's a recommendation to treat it differently so that the treatment plan is not. A source of stress and frustration for you."
15670.0,Patient,Okay.
498.0,Provider,Because that's not what I want here.
15670.0,Patient,"Okay. Okay yeah everything so um. OK, so my thing is like. Well, this medication, as far as like um I mean what do I need to be aware of just in terms of like. How would, I feel, because I haven't even started lexapro yet, because I was kind of I was making meaning."
498.0,Provider,yeah OK OK.
15670.0,Patient,"aside lexapro cuz I don't know i'm like I feel like i'm all it's almost as if seeming like it's like i'm self experimenting and i'm like I just want to figure out what it is and just you know. Like I guess yeah I don't know people have told me, you have to try things. Like different things."
498.0,Provider,"that's that's an unfortunate truth but still an accurate truth, so let me tell you about sure to so. shirt here is what we call like an Snr so it's like a selective Nora but every up, they can hit her so What it does is it bowsher Nora ephron nor epinephrine in your noradrenaline and in order to like. increase your overall mood. And with regard as a result of that it also increases your ability to maintain focus attention and concentration one of its off label uses is also. Depression in a mood elevation so it's actually beneficial for people who have ADHD and anxiety which you've mentioned several times. Because stimulants actually cause some exacerbation of anxiety wow this you receive the benefit of like the adrenaline boost, but it does not exacerbate your anxiety. But i'll start you off at 40 milligrams a day, and then, after seven days we can go up to 80 milligrams. And you know as we progress along we'll see if you're feeling, you know any. Increase in specifically what we're targeting your concentration your attention span motor hyper actively literally. And we'll keep making changes, but I can I can there's lots of starting you off at 40 milligrams it's fairly low I have lots of room to move up, but the great thing is, is that because it's not scheduled to drug you won't you you won't. You won't have to worry about like doses, you know enough for the duration of four days anything like that I still want you to checking in, but at least you'll have like that. That conscious awareness that medication is in place, because you still seem to allow now the response to the medication is gradual saw likely taper you up aggressively."
15670.0,Patient,Do the time to work.
498.0,Provider,"It will take time, it will take time to work that's why I mentioned it's not like at a while you don't take it today and fill it today it's a little bit longer than that but. Some some side effects of it is it can cause you like an increase in heart rate or blood pressure, just six to nine a minute or two to four matches with regard to your blood pressure, a lot like. stimulants adderall does the same thing and again that's because it has a stimulative effect, though it's not a stimulant um it can cause."
15670.0,Patient,"So weird because it doesn't like like. I know in my like I know people that have taken it and they say the heart rates like you know becomes really rapid and stuff like that, but it didn't really didn't really do much it didn't really do that to me in terms of like. Unless it depends on which one I take, but it didn't it didn't I don't feel like it, because every time I go to the doctor and I took it, I think it wasn't it was my hurry was actually normal."
498.0,Provider,"OK OK, and it could be, because you had taken it for a while. And that you had acclimated to it. And that's mostly it's mostly President if you've never taken it before, and then you take it, you get that little bump in the beginning, and then it kind of levels out. So it's good that you didn't have any in any of sustained cardiac response to it, do you have any underlying cardiac issues."
15670.0,Patient,"No, no. Not as far as now, I mean. Like my yeah no I don't."
498.0,Provider,"OK OK. Again, like stimulants and it can cause some decreased appetite it can cause some weight loss be mindful of some GI upset."
15670.0,Patient,"weight loss is fine, I mean I have like I have eating at all so yeah I decreases a little bit of your appetite, but I also have a eat like eating issues so i'm i'm okay with. With that yeah it's not like a big bad side effect for me because I overeat."
498.0,Provider,"Okay okay um maybe sure don't not to open the capsules because if you open it, it can irritate your eyes. For some people, it can cause. It can cause them to be sleeping."
15670.0,Patient,We be really.
498.0,Provider,"Not it does not happen with many people, but for some it can cause some sleepiness for others it can cause some insomnia, so really kind of depends, and I can stimulants typically cause in something so most people suffer from insomnia, and. Then it tapers off again because. It is a like it is like like a stimulant so just keep that in mind. It could also call some dizziness again, I know I keep saying this over and over, but it is very stimulative like so a lot of the side effects mirror. mirror stimulus. Does any of that present as a concern for you."
15670.0,Patient,"know the only concern I have is like the fatigue i'm going to like feel when i'm but i'm hoping that, like, hopefully with this medication because i'm going to be. Stopping one. Starting another one. That i've been using for a while. i'm a little nervous about look what's happening with my brain and, just like the fatigue, I feel, afterwards, or like i'm hoping that it will just like you know what i'm saying."
498.0,Provider,mm hmm I do I do well when was the last time you took an Admiral. Today okay okay um so you'll even began this tomorrow because adderall doesn't require any tapering or anything like that um. Okay.
15670.0,Patient,"All right, yeah."
498.0,Provider,"And we can just kind of see how it goes i'm hoping that it provides you with some really, really, really good benefit. So that you feel better so that you're able to focus and maintain and hopefully that you'll find that it it works so well that you don't even have to do without are all anymore and."
15670.0,Patient,"you're just gonna be able to pick it up, why be able to get it today, I do have to wait till."
498.0,Provider,"Tomorrow, that would depend on the pharmacy i'm going to submit it now. Okay yeah so i'm not."
15670.0,Patient,I take it every morning right.
498.0,Provider,"mm hmm. yep you take it every morning and you'll take it will take it once a day. But out i'll submit it to the pharmacy now and it's just about two o'clock i'm hoping that it should be ready by four. But that's really based on your pharmacy some people get their medications. Really quickly. Some people's medications aren't available until the next day, so it really depends on your pharmacy so but I will take i'll i'll address this meat for you and immediately. He should I should lexapro with it. or no actually this can also assist you with mood so let's hold off on the lexical while you take this. Because this is kind of a twofer so what the lexapro also provides this medication provides as well, in addition to like the concentration attention hyperactivity. So for now let's just take the material alone at 40 milligrams if, if at all possible, make sure that you present to group on next week because I like to know how the 40 milligrams is working for you, because, depending on how its work working out make a revision on Monday okay. Okay yeah."
15670.0,Patient,And as far as like productivity goes and everything I mean it helps with all of that it's like it's for ADHD right okay okay. Okay awesome I trust you yeah I um I think it's a good idea.
498.0,Provider,"Okay okay um, I would like, for you to. join me on Monday, they have a homework things I want you to pay attention to On Monday I like for you tell me how you felt for the most recent week how your anxiety has been and then what kind of side effects you've been feeling okay."
