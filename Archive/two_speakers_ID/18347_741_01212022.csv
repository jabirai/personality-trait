741.0,Provider,"Okay, good you're not tired."
18347.0,Patient,"yeah I feel like I slept in today was my day off. I feel like. yeah I feel like I do, but when i'm working like at night I can't get myself to fall asleep, and in the morning, I have to get up early so it's like it's like only on weekend is when I get like full probably full eight hours of sleep."
741.0,Provider,"yeah okay. That sounds frustrating so you're still having a little bit of sleep disturbance, do you think that it's you're having trouble winding down from the day."
18347.0,Patient,um it could be.
741.0,Provider,"What was really running through your head at night, you know."
18347.0,Patient,"um yeah just like throughout the entire day like what I did you know normal stuff and then like just random stuff that I wouldn't even think about just like start hitting me and i'm like Why am I even thinking about this like it, I don't think about this, you know."
741.0,Provider,"yeah says when you're trying to go to sleep that all that stuff's aren't you. yeah yeah Okay, you may have to ask and for a little bit of assistance getting to sleep for a little bit and also you kind of need to talk to your prescriber because. Lack of sleep or not being able to go to sleep is part of withdrawal. Sometimes. know and i'm not a medication person, so I have no earthly idea if you're on the right dose or if you're you know."
18347.0,Patient,"I did talk to her about it and. She she did say like sleep apnea i'm not being able to sleep, if you already have that and makes it worse, you know um. And then, just the medication itself, it gives you a little bit of like energy, I would say, as I try not to take it too late, during the day, but sometimes I have to so she's she said that to try melatonin I haven't tried that yet."
741.0,Provider,Okay yeah.
18347.0,Patient,Try some sleep medication I haven't tried it yet.
741.0,Provider,"Okay yeah melatonin is fairly decent but you've got to get a good enough level in your bloodstream before it starts to work so. It may take a little bit before it. hell okay. um. Okay, so. Ever still have and are you waiting on your paycheck."
18347.0,Patient,or no I just I just didn't. feel like i'm so busy yeah I didn't just like. runs my mind when i'm in bed I forget about it during the day.
741.0,Provider,All right. Okay. i'm tired because it's Friday.
18347.0,Patient,yeah.
741.0,Provider,"yeah but usually by Friday i'm. Tired. From. The week before you know. from everything that i've been doing. And that probably. There, and now i'm at hours by the time I get to Friday, the man hours i'm getting the sleeper no love."
18347.0,Patient,"Show you on that, I mean same here because I have Thursdays and Fridays off Thursday and Fridays, is when I do get sleep so."
741.0,Provider,"Alright, well, I am going to. go over here. and pull up your chart because we need to do a. Safety plan. So that we make sure. To make sure that you know what what to do, and we know what you're gonna do in the case of an emergency. or crisis. Okay, so. Here we go and so what are three warning signs thoughts images mood situation behavior that a crisis three warning signs that a crisis may be developing. Like."
18347.0,Patient,In in general or.
741.0,Provider,"In general, but within yourself, one that might lead to you wanting to hurt yourself."
18347.0,Patient,"Obviously, when you told me that last session I was kind of shocked because that's like never happened with me before. So I don't like see myself ever doing that. Right, the most I could see is like maybe like impulsive behaviors or something like that I would see I think three warning sign for me would be. me getting a little more emotional than usual i'm like things like triggering me more than they would or they should and then. You don't like it."
741.0,Provider,at all.
18347.0,Patient,"it's hard like I don't know I feel like lately i've been getting way way more emotional than usual, and if it doesn't feel normal to me, but maybe it is."
741.0,Provider,Well yeah you know why because you're not numbing out all the. Feelings were dread.
18347.0,Patient,"Okay, that makes sense."
741.0,Provider,that's what's happening see your lot when when you used before. Everything that you felt you didn't want to feel so you something covered up. So you've taken a whole lifetime of feelings and shove them down inside. And not felt them. So now. you're not using to cover them up and they're coming they're bubbling up what's happening. yeah it feels like they're all bubbling up and you can't control them they're they're coming up with.
18347.0,Patient,One of them to or not.
741.0,Provider,"Right. yeah yeah. So okay um at first they're going to feel really, really intense. um. But it will dissipate it won't be that intense forever Okay, because you come across to me as like a really logical person not really a feely person. yeah i'm a feely person. So I experienced feelings a lot all day. But a lot of people don't. react that way, a lot of people stay in their head. and i'm so when they first get clean and they start feeling all these feelings are like oh my God oh my God i'm losing control. But you're not really. I mean. Some of them are probably overwhelming to you, but you're not really losing total control. And after a while after you decompress all of the feelings that you've been stuffing for years. Then it will be more normal. You got to go through this period of time where you're gonna have to feel everything. Yes."
18347.0,Patient,"It couldn't be good, though I mean."
741.0,Provider,It is it's good for you it's it's an opportunity to heal some hurt. it's an opportunity to learn how to be angry and be okay with it. And not hurt other people in the process. itself what it's an opportunity to learn to label your feelings when I first got clean the very first time I couldn't tell you what I was feeling I just knew I was feeling a bunch of junk.
18347.0,Patient,yeah.
741.0,Provider,"But I couldn't label the feeling like I couldn't tell you well, this is her, and this is sadness and this is, I, the only thing I could tell you is this."
18347.0,Patient,yeah.
741.0,Provider,"That sounds familiar. yeah yeah. yeah. i'm sorry i'm not I really am not reading your mail Okay, I promise. it's just that i've been there. Okay. So getting more emotional is an issue for you what other things might. might make you feel out of control and. That you're you're having an upheaval."
18347.0,Patient,"Well, today I want to get out of that, to be honest, I see I don't even want to be on this call. Okay push muscle."
741.0,Provider,"awesome I commend you for that I do I know how hard, this is. you're experiencing some depression. So depression. would also be a warning sign for you. Especially if you don't deal with it. Everybody has ups and downs. And we're we're new in recovery we don't have a lot of connections with people who are healthy. So we feel really isolated and we feel really hopeless. Are you feeling hopeless."
18347.0,Patient,know no I don't I don't really know what i'm feeling but. that's just like a lot so.
741.0,Provider,yeah and so everything is all bunched up together and you can't really pick apart what you're feeling. yeah okay. So getting emotional being depressed and what one other thing that might. be a warning sign that you have an issue that you need help with.
18347.0,Patient,"No, I don't feel like this falls under like being depressed or like not being able to take care of yourself."
741.0,Provider,"yeah okay um I, it is part of being depressed, but you have a lack of motivation."
18347.0,Patient,yeah. yeah.
741.0,Provider,Is that it or is it something else. This is not motivated.
18347.0,Patient,"me don't know but. yeah everything else, like I haven't kept helpful feed him, but I will keep myself, you know."
741.0,Provider,"I have yeah lack of motivation. Care of self and a lot of that is it goes along with depression Okay, but. That is a very definitely a warning sign that you might want to pay attention to. Alright, so what are some of the coping strategies that you can do within yourself without reaching out to anybody else, but things that you can do to take your mind off of your problems and without contacting someone else like. Like going for a walk. yeah. or. Doing yoga or. i'm. Reading a book."
18347.0,Patient,"Good never right now. I could never right now. I can't focus so hard to focus um i'll play video games. and watch TV and play with my cat that's like the biggest thing for me as like put all my focus into kind of takes away what i'm feeling for the moment, if it's bad. yeah. I just said. yeah like. When I feel a panic attack comment that's like the first thing I run to because it distracts me more than anything else, can you know even a real human can distract me like that."
741.0,Provider,"Right exactly because you're you're a pat. Has unconditional love for you. And that's what you're requiring at that point it's just that unconditional cuz I you know they get in trouble and and you correct them, but they don't really care because they come back a few minutes later, you know. Okay, I play with the cat play video games um you can focus if you're playing video games, you can focus on what you. focus on."
18347.0,Patient,"yeah I guess that's what it is, but like with any other thing I guess you're right because, even at work, I have to be so focused, I can do it when i'm like. Reading a book or I have to do something important I can't."
741.0,Provider,Okay okay and let's see. Do you do you ever do puzzles.
18347.0,Patient,"puzzles and randomly like maybe sometimes so I don't mind them, but I feel that's something I would hope, like I don't distract my mind, a little bit."
741.0,Provider,"So that might be something that you could do. and That will, as will distract your mind from what you're thinking or feeling right. Okay. So i'm going to put that down. And that doesn't matter, what kind of puzzle, I mean it could be a word, personal or it could actually be a puzzle that's like what puzzle pieces, I mean."
18347.0,Patient,Something complicated.
741.0,Provider,"Yes, that's gonna devote that you're gonna have to devote all of your attention to. and the next one is people and social settings that provide distraction. So a social setting or person, because people might not okay work. Okay."
18347.0,Patient,"Oh, so one of the biggest distractions."
741.0,Provider,What else.
18347.0,Patient,Hello that's like the only thing I could think of.
741.0,Provider,And I there people that you connect with really well that you could actually share that that you're having issues.
18347.0,Patient,or or. Or can you go to the.

18347.0,Patient,So what about those.
741.0,Provider,And what our professional supports that you'd be really. willing to reach out to like your primary care physician. or bright heart health. Or the program yeah.
18347.0,Patient,Maybe maybe by her home.

741.0,Provider,How can you make your environment safe. two options. for making your environment safe. And you said you watch TV. Do you listen to music. yo okay so listen to music might help the sexual a little bit right. If you I like to dance. So I can musical.
18347.0,Patient,Like to get up.
741.0,Provider,Okay. And what other thing that will make your environment more safe.
18347.0,Patient,safe place.
741.0,Provider,Your room. yeah okay. i'm relaxing. All right. And what is the one thing that is most important to you and worth living for.
18347.0,Patient,One thing. Hello my.
741.0,Provider,"Okay. That makes sense to me and. My for a long time my my pets were. What I live for and then after I had kids it was my children and my grandchildren. Now there are what I live, for you know."
18347.0,Patient,yeah let me.
741.0,Provider,"All right. Alright, so we got that done yay. All right, so um have you. Thought any more about some of the things that you'd like to work on in recovery. Since you're having counseling. Obviously you need to learn. About addiction and how. The process of recovery right. and And so, will probably work on some relapse prevention stuff okay. um. But. Are there other things you want to work on. feeling identifying them. yeah."
18347.0,Patient,"I mean, you would think like anytime someone is like emotional kind of probably sad so like that's. that's like the only thing I can identify."
741.0,Provider,High okay see I cry when i'm happy.
18347.0,Patient,I don't I don't think i've ever.
741.0,Provider,"Ever I am ecstatically happy, I have, I will cry. So yeah so feeling. and identifying them. and any other. Why do people keep messaging me. Oh they're not messaging me that's good. i'm like what what is come on. Identifying. feelings and what to do with them, maybe."
18347.0,Patient,yeah.
741.0,Provider,Sometimes we don't do anything but.
18347.0,Patient,that's kind of what i've been doing yeah you just do you just experienced them you just feel them.
741.0,Provider,"yo and one thing that you might try. Is journaling what you're feeling where it comes from, what does it feel why. Sometimes people. get really sad and their whole body hurts. and other times people. They get happy and they feel like little bubbles in their stomach I mean you know i'm saying so you can identify what's going on in your body. As well as your emotion what's physical, as well as emotional. And then you can write down. What you're thinking about because that's. A real good indication. what's causing the feeling. and"
18347.0,Patient,"I used to do that and I was really, really down and bad. I just randomly stopped doing that because I stopped feeling that way boy."
741.0,Provider,"it's actually a good thing to do when you feel good too, because it gives you the opportunity further down the line to go back and figure out okay what was I doing that made me feel so good. what was happening. Right, because those are the Those are the things that we want to. Have happen more. and The other thing that i'd like to do is i'd like for you to at least look online. To see if you can find an A meeting or an na meeting or something along that line that is online that you can go to. And so, just like do a Google search or if you're on Facebook, you can do a Facebook search and there are groups and meetings. Online for people in recovery and there's all kinds there's a na celebrate recovery and so as i'm. lots of different ones okay. So I want you to look it up online and then I want you to start shopping groups, and I want you to find a group that talks about solutions like how do I live today. What do I do to get through today. Not what they did in the past okay. and that's going to help you build your support system. And, as also want to. help you. and increase the friendships that you have, and I also want you to make a list of things hobbies that you like to do. or things that you want to learn to do. Okay. cool that make it does any of this make sense."
18347.0,Patient,"Yes, it does."
741.0,Provider,"Okay, because if you can find a hobbies, then you can look online and find groups that do those things that have those same interests and then you meet people who are not using but have other interests, but the same ensures right. So look up online and. Recovery groups. And then make your list of hobbies. Because i'll tell you from my experience. The two most frequent things that i'm told. That makes. People relapse or things that trigger them to us is isolation, which is not having any friends. And i'm. Being bored. So. If those two things are what triggers people, the most to you then i'm going to nip that in the bud. i'm going to find a way to keep that from happening so and, of course, when where we're new and recovery. We attract people who use because we still dress like we use we still carry ourselves like we use we still talk like that, I mean you know there's there's just a little telltale signs when you're out and about you know if that person uses or."
18347.0,Patient,Who.
741.0,Provider,"You know, because you know you just kind of queued yourself to look for that. Right right Okay, well then they do the same thing and we want to stop. doing that, but it takes time to learn new behavior. So until we do we still attract those type of people that's why I I go in a totally different direction for helping you find people who you have something in common with maybe it's something that you used to do, but you don't do anymore."
18347.0,Patient,well.
741.0,Provider,"You know, because because you started using and everything else. fell by the wayside. Just to give you an idea. um my when I was a little girl, I mean little like in second grade my mom had me involved in a garden club. Okay, it was a junior garden club, so I learned how to make flower arrangements and do some conservation and different things like that right and I learned a terrarium. Well, the other I got I quit doing all of that stuff. forgot how to do most of it. But now i'm going that would be fun to do."
18347.0,Patient,yo.
741.0,Provider,And so the other day I started working on putting together a terrarium and i'm also now building fairy gardens.
18347.0,Patient,whoa.
741.0,Provider,"So it was just something that I wanted to do again well there's groups of people who do that stuff all the time. So i've just widened my. My. ability to make friends, because I have something new that I can actually talk to people about. So. You see my logic. Or do you."
18347.0,Patient,"yeah I do, I mean I used to play. Nice play basketball, I was on the team and everything and then after and I just completely stopped that aren't enough played. A long time."
741.0,Provider,"yeah i'd like to. yeah, I would like to be able to go back to playing tennis I played tennis also high school. junior high and high school. i'm physically i'm not able to do that anymore. I just want to be able to, but I cannot so. My knees and and and that that torn up when I was doing it so."
18347.0,Patient,While you're doing.
741.0,Provider,"yeah yeah. So Oh well, that's Okay, I can still play a mean game of table tennis. I just can't run all over record like."
18347.0,Patient,ping pong.
741.0,Provider,"All right, as you have another appointment, or you want to make another one."
18347.0,Patient,yeah what up to make one little know going.
741.0,Provider,"Okay, and we can we can do as we can go ahead and make your appointment, there are two appointments for. yeah someone that. doesn't want to that. and It can make both of them February that way we don't have to worry about it right. Okay. Okay, you have some surveys that are due. and your drug screen is overdue, have you done your original and. labs."
18347.0,Patient,"yeah I did them like the first week they told me I had 14 days to do it, I did it like the first three days."
741.0,Provider,"Okay, you need to make sure that the. That House has gotten the results. Okay, do I do that, though, because I, they requested it from."
18347.0,Patient,"quest diagnostics and that's what I want to do it and it tells you like, who requested it. And what test it is so I did a blood test a urine test on a pregnancy test."
741.0,Provider,And that's the result. i'm currently have not been. sent back so you I would start with the virtual clinic. or even your prescriber.
18347.0,Patient,phone call.
741.0,Provider,"and ask if they've come in. Because, and the only reason i'm saying that is because we've got a red stoplight at drug screen. And you don't want to get into the habit of having to go to that. lab every time you need to do a drug screen So if you do every single month they do have to worry about it."
18347.0,Patient,"Okay, oh yeah I mean, can I just contact the place, I did it like on Facebook just on the back."
741.0,Provider,"yeah there are supposed to send it and go there, I make sure that they've sent the results and make sure that they have the accurate fax number. You might want to call the virtual clinic first get the fax number and then call the place where you went and make sure that they have the correct fax number. And because I don't know um. I just I know that sometimes a lot of people have been having problems with it basically so Okay, so as far as your appointments I have Friday February 4. And that afternoon that's pretty much wide open."
18347.0,Patient,"Oh, I might be. Can we do, can we do the week either before or after the oh no that's the first week of February we do a week after that."

741.0,Provider,"i'm here, I know it's. it's not easy it's not easy to reach out when you're used to being very independent and it's not easy to experience all the feelings all at one time. Okay. yeah all right hang in there okay. cool all right you're welcome bye. Right now we're going to do some education on addiction and the process of recovery and we're going to work on some feelings identifying them and what how to what to do with them. And we're also going to start working toward. Getting connected, so that we don't have those triggers of boredom and isolation. And messing with her, I think she's depressed because she's isolated and doesn't know what to do with herself she's trying to stay away from people who use so. I think she's struggling with that. Thank you."
