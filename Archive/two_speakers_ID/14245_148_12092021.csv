148.0,Provider,Oh OK OK. Good um okay. What else has been going on since we last met.
14245.0,Patient,"changed like my eating habits, a little bit i've been so this is nurse on my work where she's a carnivore person, so if she's like 50 and she looks so good. she's so skinny has no fat and is buff and doesn't even work out and all she needs is me and me and me so i've been actually eating like a bunch of me and veggies and I feel really good. Also, like I cut out carbs and trying to stop carbs and sugars, but I can only do one at this one, at a time so so I definitely like cut out carbs and I feel good i'm definitely addicted to sugar that sucks but. yeah I know i've definitely been feeling a little better tanya gave me like so medication I gotta delivered but haven't taken it like. I don't know i'm just kind of scared like i've never really been on medication and I feel like if I change my eating habits like. That skin they make me feel better and like less like like it's going to give me more energy because i've been in those situations where I changed my eating habits and I feel more alive and like happy I don't know so I want to try that first before like take the pills."
148.0,Provider,yeah I think what. We put in our bodies we don't realize how much of an effect it has on us.
14245.0,Patient,Right yeah exactly.
148.0,Provider,eat yes absolutely makes a huge difference in how we feel and just our energy throughout the day.
14245.0,Patient,Even if I worked out like 15 minutes like I know they'll make me feel good too so. I really want to try instead of like actually just going straight to medication.
148.0,Provider,Good good.
14245.0,Patient,I don't think I need it like that.
148.0,Provider,I think that's a really smart plan yeah yeah and you're already feeling better just from cutting out carbs.
14245.0,Patient,yeah I am. I feel less like deprived and like like I actually want to do things.
148.0,Provider,So it's motivation.
14245.0,Patient,"yeah it's it's only been like maybe like five days Oh, but I feel really good like actually no I I was eating a little bit of carbs you for like my five days, but not as many and. On like on lunch I just we have like a little oven I just make a patty and I put in the oven for my seasoning and ask them cheddar cheese and like that's all i've been eating for lunch. Also, like that's been helping me save my money to like like pretty broke so and my boyfriend he's not on my ass about it but he's like hey like you need to start stable I he helps me on like talks to me like this, how much you should have at the end of this month and blah blah so. that's been helping."
148.0,Provider,"Okay, because you usually spend more money on food eating out mm hmm and that adds up."
14245.0,Patient,Oh yeah it sounds like that I think the hardest part about being an adult is feeding yourself every day. I miss home mom all just here's dinner.
148.0,Provider,have your healthy home cooked. Are you ready to go.
14245.0,Patient,that's the hardest part auto paying bills whatever but. yeah.
148.0,Provider,"that's funny yeah totally um i'm good okay so you've made some really positive adjustments, since we last talked."
14245.0,Patient,yeah I do feel better.
148.0,Provider,"Okay, good and then. Has the weed."
14245.0,Patient,"Not gonna lie like there's no progress in La. But i'm. So so like long story short, but I ran out of like actual flower, and now I bought wax but the watch isn't like hitting the same so like. I feel like i'm not getting as high so um. So I guess it's been better like guy. I don't know, like my boyfriend's like okay you're you're not in invitees for a while, like la okay okay so it's our lead we're still on the same flow but."
148.0,Provider,and remind me does your does your boyfriend smoke.
14245.0,Patient,No he won't he doesn't smell with me like he he will randomly for like at a concert or something. He never smoked with me.
148.0,Provider,Okay okay and you're still smoking daily.
14245.0,Patient,yeah.
148.0,Provider,"Okay okay um, how do you feel, how do you feel about your smoking."
14245.0,Patient,"I still feel like I needed to like tone it down a bit um. Honestly it's it's really tough, to see what it's hard for me like. You know, like. I don't feel like. I don't know people can get addicted to eat, yes, but it's like kind of funny because we can kill you so. Like it's like a little baby jog way you know people can be addicted to sugar like. Coffee yeah. yeah yeah. yeah I just."
148.0,Provider,"I guess it doesn't really matter hearing what you're saying it doesn't really matter what we're addicted to like we could be addicted to food right we. Did to gambling. All kinds of different things, and I think it's important to ask yourself when is this a problem for me right, even if it won't kill me when if it's you know I can still function and go to. work. You get my stuff done when is it a problem for me like, how is it affecting me negatively."
14245.0,Patient,"it's really not like now that me if you put it that way it's not the only the only two times, it was affecting me is like. It would make me lazy and then the other times, it makes me broke, like the truly it i'm like I can I can still take my head in the morning and then go to work and i'll be fine like um. But obviously on my you get like super stone before I go to work, but like I just like like the little like feeling in your body like sick little euphoria you get like I don't i'm not trying to get like brick and stone, to my mind, you know. So it's."
148.0,Provider,A feeling that week gives you so. You don't like being sober is that what you're saying.
14245.0,Patient,"yeah a lot of terms like I like to be like. Like hi you know, to have fun. I have to admit that yes."
148.0,Provider,mm hmm. Can you then on have can you have fun if you're sober.
14245.0,Patient,"I can, yes, I can. And you know I actually before. Before this I did run out of weed and I turn to alcohol when there's no more weed and but see like if I stop smoking weed. it's my withdrawals only for a week like just a week i'm like antsy and irritated and after that i'm fine, but that that week i'm drinking alcohol like i'm just coming home and having a beer or two a night, you know."
148.0,Provider,So there's definitely it sounds like there's. Something there you're trying to fill with a substance right.
14245.0,Patient,Like like what.
148.0,Provider,I don't know what is it that you don't like um. What do you not like about being silver.
14245.0,Patient,"Oh. don't know I just feel like like being like kind of stronger like I like it just makes things more fun and like it's funny and my body feels nice i'm not really trying to like avoid something and honestly. i'm actually a really smart drunk I know my limits of two year old stuff and. And like I know I know when to stop but. that's basically I don't know if there's something like more in deep that are know why, like, I want to feel like this, like, I really have no idea. What to do."
148.0,Provider,I wonder how much of it could be just a part of like a routine right. yeah yeah.
14245.0,Patient,yeah I mean since freshman year basically.
148.0,Provider,mm hmm.
14245.0,Patient,And i'm already 26 so that's like 14 years 12 I don't care.
148.0,Provider,"Well it's definitely something i'd like to continue to monitor together and just you know what's coming up for you around your use, whether it is alcohol or weed. Are there any goals you want to send around your smoking, right now, if you want to cut back at all."
14245.0,Patient,"Honestly i'm not really. I mean. I don't want it. I will come back if it's affecting my bank account like that's it. Okay. that's it, but if I have enough money, and I can buy ice my will. i'm honestly not like really trying to look for a job change soon i'm not trying to eat clean so. Okay Okay, right now, and I can honestly tell you like. I feel better and it's not really affecting my mood anymore, like my energy, I think, ever since I changed my eating habits."
148.0,Provider,"Okay. All right. So, for now, your treatment goals will be to continue on a healthy diet. continue to monitor the. Make sure that that isn't. Contributing to any financial stress and if it is let's revisit that. An exercise I think exercise has been a big goal for you recently too So how are. You with it, are you still doing."
14245.0,Patient,"About not really. Okay, no I haven't I need to jump back into it, I will try to do that."
148.0,Provider,Okay.
14245.0,Patient,"I won't like forced myself and do that every day, but at least every other day I think that's why I was like okay i'm you do every day and I got over it, or something."
148.0,Provider,Okay okay so every other day exercise for a minimum of 15 minutes.
14245.0,Patient,yeah i'm. Like How much longer do we have like talking. Today right oh yeah.
148.0,Provider,"I think i'm do you need to go, because I think that."
14245.0,Patient,No one's gonna like bring up something else.
148.0,Provider,Oh yeah please.
14245.0,Patient,"Okay, only I know i'm really take your time okay so."
148.0,Provider,um Now this is your time.
14245.0,Patient,"Okay, so when I was younger. I okay i've never been raped, but i've been like sexually harass like like to my cousins the first time I was. 12 I. can't remember. But it, it was like by one of my older cousins he so he's like 10 years older than me but um. Basically, he was like trying to touch me in my sleep and he didn't really like get that far but. And then he was in it was like a big sleep over then he tried like touching my cousin she's only a year older than me and then I like I really think else follows like okay like what's he doing so, and then the next day like we all go to the swap me and. My cousin JESSICA she's like hey like it just me and her like she came up to me, she really hated like to he tried to like touching you. Like I kind of saw and he tried to to me blah blah blah and she's like oh yeah you know, like whatever you know, and she in like kind of affected her, she was like crying about a like I i've never cried about it, or like. felt like I wanted to kill him or something. And this was like we talked about it more as adults like. Three four years ago. And she's a dude she's a, you will have been so strong and like you know never cried about anything and like if anything else, so you know, like I would comfort her like it's Okay, you know Paula like I mean it's not Okay, but you know it's something like it sucks but it happens and. Like I don't I didn't know what to say, but not, I want to see like get over it, but I was just like you know we just gotta keep going so. Like I don't know why it's not like. Like is it affecting me because i'm not like crying about it, I don't see him and I don't like till this day like we we hang out like with that person and like nothing happened, or like now I hang out with him all the time, but. Like it's weird like it's like it never happened to you know."
148.0,Provider,So you feel like it was just brushed under the rug.
14245.0,Patient,"Oh yeah definitely and I don't know if, like ever since that like. So after high school when I broke up with my first boyfriend I have my little whole phase and. You know I looked around, and I remember like being at a party and there's like a group of Dudes talking to each other, and I suppose, like every one of them. And i'll say oh so guys like I didn't care, you know, like, I was like oh my God like they're always like oh I didn't care and every time I would have successful run after i'd like i'm thinking like high five them and Guy there was no like. connection at all like I didn't give a Fuck like I would just leave or like and I am thinking about it till this day like. I wasn't like having sex, because I was like horny or like want to dig like I don't know what I think I just wanted attention because I don't remember any time, like you, like oh yeah that was like the best sex like I don't remember any of the sex."
148.0,Provider,Or are you drinking are under the influence. You just don't you kind of blocked it out at some.
14245.0,Patient,"I was probably just a little high, but I mean being high to me is like. very normal like i'm like i'm sober to me like i'm sober window right like it's not even that bad like I still from sober but. No, I mean there's been times and it sucks like there was times, where like I didn't want to and they still did you know, like in now she's like Okay, whatever like I said no, but whatever you know, like things like that. and I mean, now it kind of like affects me not my cousin like that's weird but it's like just having sex with all these people."
148.0,Provider,You feel about.
14245.0,Patient,"It in a way, like, I feel like. I didn't know my words in a shadow but. i'm not like mother myself, but I did wish like I didn't do a bunch of shit."
148.0,Provider,yeah okay. So you're thinking. back into your past and maybe some mistakes that you've made when you were younger and that's bringing up some emotions for you now like guilt and shame and feeling bad for not respecting your body more.
14245.0,Patient,yeah totally.
148.0,Provider,"Okay, so and the thing about thinking back into past right is there's nothing that we can actually change there. So that deserves a lot of healing right if these emotions are coming up for you around your past you deserve healing you deserve forgiveness. And you're not making the same lifestyle choices today. No right."
14245.0,Patient,you're right.
148.0,Provider,You do respect yourself today is what I hear when you talk about.
14245.0,Patient,sleep oh yeah my boyfriend definitely realize like how worthy I am but he's the only person in my life will guide like a random guy has shown me my worth like nobody else ever did.
148.0,Provider,So it sounds like these experiences from your past have taught you a lot.
14245.0,Patient,No yeah definitely like I definitely know what love it and who's a good person who's not and I know like if I like someone or not like I know what i'm feeling.
148.0,Provider,yeah um something I might try Gloria when these. Is this something that's coming up for you a lot like are you thinking about this a lot.
14245.0,Patient,"Not as much as like in the beginning of my relationship. mm hmm, but I do question it sometimes especially like what happened was my cousin like i'm like in my like normal for not like being angry at him or crying about it, or like fuel like I am I am kind of gross dial button like I still like hug him and love him, you know. Like it's just little things like that, where i'm like is it Okay, should I like cry about it, like I don't know."
148.0,Provider,Have you ever talked to anybody about what happened with your cousin before other than your other cousin.
14245.0,Patient,"um well. My other my other cousin that's here right now she's really room they're sisters, like the other one they got touched their sister so she told her. And kimmy the one that's here she talked to him and he was like really upset and he he he was like crying a lot and yeah so I he's never. really came up to me so like i'm Sorry, I think, after she had that conversation with him and she's he saw me he just like hug me really hard, but he never said, like sorry for like molesting you, you know."
148.0,Provider,"So i'm a little bit confused, you said that he started to you know go into touch you but that he didn't actually touch you or did."
14245.0,Patient,"not know he did he did like no like i'm seeing like. Like my my my cousin JESSICA that i've also got molested like she told her cousin kimmy I mean starting to her because of her sister to me who's here. kimmy him like hey like what the Fuck like Why are you doing that blah blah, and he started crying academy and he apologized to JESSICA, but he never really apologize to me he just like gave me a hug and like that's it like he never said, like sorry for like molesting you, you know."
148.0,Provider,So he actually did Mullah.
14245.0,Patient,yeah he did.
148.0,Provider,Oh wow.
14245.0,Patient,yeah he definitely did. yeah I mean it wasn't anything crazy like never like fingered near anything like that he was just feeling my body up like that's it. Okay yeah.
148.0,Provider,you're feeling like you didn't have as much emotion around.
14245.0,Patient,"What yes that's what it is. But even when I say like I said I see him now not like grossed out or like I hate him, you know."
148.0,Provider,mm hmm do you feel like you may be numbed it out and i'm dealt what happened to you could move on from it easier.
14245.0,Patient,yeah definitely.
148.0,Provider,"yeah and it's still coming up for you today, which says that there probably is some emotion there that has been suppressed. Is there anything that you'd want to say to him about this now."
14245.0,Patient,"I mean not really it's like kind of awkward if I do talk to him about it, I really like anybody, even if I talk to me about it, and she already knows like i'm still going to feel weird talking about it. Even talking to JESSICA, like the other victim, like, I would still feel weird about it."
148.0,Provider,So it feels uncomfortable to talk about out loud. yeah definitely. Does it feel to talk about to me.
14245.0,Patient,"um it feels Okay, because you don't know him."
148.0,Provider,"Okay, so I think what we could do for your own healing around this is to write about it and write anything that you'd want to say to him, but you don't have to give this to him."
14245.0,Patient,it's just.
148.0,Provider,"A way for you to. Emotionally let this off your chest and get it out of you. Okay, how does that sound."
14245.0,Patient,Okay y'all can try that.
148.0,Provider,"After you write write down whatever you want to write I would wrap it up, I would you know. Do something with it, to give you some like. i'm basing this out of me."
14245.0,Patient,"JESSICA to do that too, if she wants."
148.0,Provider,"yeah yeah and we can talk about what that was like for you, the next time we meet what it was like for you to get these words and these emotions out of you, and then what it was like to let it go."
14245.0,Patient,"Okay, that sounds good."
148.0,Provider,"rip it up and be free of this now because it sounds like. While, on one hand you felt like it wasn't bothering you. On the other. hand it sounds like this is something that you've kept suppressed, and you, for a long time for many years."
14245.0,Patient,yeah so.
148.0,Provider,The best thing that you can do around this is release release it.
14245.0,Patient,Okay. All right.
148.0,Provider,hi how are you feeling now after talking about this.
14245.0,Patient,I guess the same. yeah.
148.0,Provider,Okay okay so little there's still some confusion there.
14245.0,Patient,"yeah no not really I just like you said, like it was I just kind of like brush it away and I explained, like a lot of shit I I remember like. Some guy like really like told me like yo you're such a sad girl like I showed too many emotions so after that I like started with just brushing everything way I started. Like not showing emotions because, like it was pushing. Men away or like so like now, when me my freedom to have like an argument or like i'm not about something i'm just like Okay, whatever like I just push it away he's like no let's talk about it, like no like I want to push it away it's not a big deal but."
148.0,Provider,"yeah talk about it, and if it feels like it's too difficult to talk about right about it because that's a very powerful way to let it out of you, but these emotions they deserve to be felt."
14245.0,Patient,And they are definitely.
148.0,Provider,"heard, and you know validated, because what you feel whatever you feel it's real."
14245.0,Patient,"No, no, definitely I definitely. agree to La Li speaking, how you feel and stuff, but I do not know, but there, I do have my moments are like to talk about is the big deal just push it away like I have my moments, where I do that i'm just very like used to like hiding my emotions."
148.0,Provider,"Because that's what feels comfortable for you, because that's what you've done for so long."
14245.0,Patient,yeah basically.
148.0,Provider,"yeah so if you're challenging yourself um. You know by feeling these things that come up for you by talking about them that just means that you're forcing yourself out of your comfort zone, which means that you're growing. yeah really good work Gloria."
