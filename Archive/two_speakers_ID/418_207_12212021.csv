418.0,Patient,"Most of walmart, so I think the stuff that i'm waiting on one more so i'm hoping to get here have you heard of those squishy mills and you don't know about or. yeah that's the biggest rip off ever like. ordered Bradley one, and then I didn't realize it said eight inches and when it got here, it was like six inches like it was so small, I think 30 bucks for, as it says crap so. I ordered another one, and it was like 4999 a thing and it's not here yet, but even for the 12 inch when it's not worth 50 bucks I was like the biggest rip off. So she wanted."
207.0,Provider,To this question malls.
418.0,Patient,yeah I was like I don't even know what this isn't a pillow or just updating well like.
207.0,Provider,it's a stuffed animal that uses a pillow.
418.0,Patient,"i've got now is so small, you can even use it for like a for one ankle like for problems, I mean it's like not even seven seven inches tall like it says eight inches but that's maybe from the very cheap of its Horn because it's a cow or whatever. yeah it's more like six inches."
207.0,Provider,"I don't know if you can see, this but I took this picture last night that's my son he's sleeping on his questionable."

418.0,Patient,"Right yeah yeah that was 30 bucks for just so much premium my cell phone like it's like so. I was like oh. Order, the big one it's supposed to be here next day or so, but."
207.0,Provider,Have you wrapped everything so far. Have you wrapped whatever you have so far.
418.0,Patient,"hey yeah well I think it's at my mom's I put it up there in the back, because I guess, I thought, when you ordered from walmart COM, like all your stuff came from walmart but it doesn't did you know that, like. They use it like third company whatever I didn't know this till recently, and when you order from walmart COM, he can come from anywhere. eBay or something yeah I didn't know that either so i'm trying to take back to the store and they're like are you didn't think about the storage ordered it online it goes to a third party seller. So i'm going to send it back and mail it back and all that stuff yeah. But. You cannot take it back to the story. Not necessarily."
207.0,Provider,I had no idea I don't know if i've ever ordered. i'm such an Amazon person like that's my go to I forget that other stores have websites.
418.0,Patient,I don't think i'm gonna move to that. I found a book on there yesterday I ordered it last night and it feels good to be here from Christmas.
207.0,Provider,"With Amazon, a lot of my stuff I get overnight delivery is because there's a warehouse in Charlotte so like they have warehouses everywhere, so the deliveries are a lot faster if it's something that's in a warehouse so. I have even like switched a lot of but like toilet paper paper towels household products, I just do on Amazon, because I know it'll be here, the next day it's not any more expensive."
418.0,Patient,"But I need to yeah neither I don't know why don't ever use them and I need to work is that this whole walmart or do I just got me. Because I would have like a penguin from that same squished or whatever and. I thought it's gonna be so it in the picture it showed a toddler kids Dana beside me and they're like the same hot. So I was like oh my gosh it's gonna be like you know, like five feet tall he's gonna love it, it was about six inches tall two and I was like that, because it never I can't read. I read the whole thing trying to find a size on it, you know it didn't take us all this kid is huge and he's standing beside of it, you know, so it must be at least that talk, no, no, no it's about six inches tall too so. It was like $37 do. really matter but. i'm not gonna i'm just gonna let him have it, I guess, because he likes penguins for a while, but yeah. it's very misleading picture."
207.0,Provider,So do you do if you guys are doing Christmas at grandma's on Thursday will you go over their Christmas morning to to your mom.
418.0,Patient,"This year they're changing it up a little bit always before. My kids and stay at home on Christmas Eve na are we well i'll stay to and with our booth together for Christmas morning. But then my sister and brother, have decided that they want to be at home with their kids at their house for Christmas morning like and. I guess for staying and Kevin and stuff so we're backing it up a day and we're gonna do it on the 23rd so I really don't know for the 24th through the 25th morning I don't know i'm helping my mom let me get there, but i'm thinking i'm thinking rather be at her house and. England malone's which will suck if I don't get to be with her and Christians moving in like yeah. Then. They all make me so mad at me because I feel like i'm saying what's wrong with what we've done for every you know what I mean like right it's always worked before and it got it allowed me to be with my kids. This morning you know yeah."
207.0,Provider,"Well, and if that's the case that you guys are doing Thursday and not doing anything Christmas morning, then you just have to pretend Thursday is Christmas in your mind. You know what I mean like because it's. Right, as far as grief and sadness and everything Christmas Day so then just wake up Saturday and just pretend it's a Saturday not Christmas necessarily you know."
418.0,Patient,Right that's what it really is yeah children everything in 2013. lose the 23rd. The Church on Christmas Day not sorry i'm looking for a lot. Less than what. We usually do.
207.0,Provider,And then.
418.0,Patient,"I don't know if my mom I don't know how they're doing this, it really is my brother lives, right here close it is to live in knoxville so she's like a little over an hour late. and"
207.0,Provider,"I feel like it's fair for you to. advocate for yourself with your mom and say I deserve to spend Christmas morning with my kids and I get that bradley's a different situation because she doesn't live there, but at least your son, you should be able to walk up there and spend some time with him on Christmas morning. Regardless of how your mom feels about it."
418.0,Patient,"Right I don't know she let me she's like i'm thinking here, but that can. Take me to this bucket here. Is that any better. Every. year now."
207.0,Provider,anymore.
418.0,Patient,"No, you don't know I can hear you now like, it must be those earbuds. Because I didn't know it all. But um yeah i'm hoping they're sure, let me come up there and we're like you know morning. But you never know how her turns gonna be I mean like I said last year had to go get covered tested."
207.0,Provider,"So what is there a specific food or drink your mom really enjoys because what if, like. I don't like the word manipulation right, but if it's not how benefits her, she might be more likely to have you up there, so what if you offer to make like. A food that she really likes or bring her coffee or something, because then you're not making it about can I come see my kid it's like it's Christmas, I want to do something nice for my mom but then you'll get to see your kid to."
418.0,Patient,"More thinking, I could offer to make some kind of breakfast and then cuz she. Usually my dad i'll get up and click on Christmas morning like cook a big breakfast for everybody, but he's gonna do that, the day before I guess we're going to eat our breakfast on Christmas Eve morning that make sense."
207.0,Provider,yeah okay. So learning is going to be your Christmas.
418.0,Patient,"morning basically basically yeah and then hopefully she'll let me. out, I mean if I go to church because i'm going to church with her is a big thing, so if I go to church on Christmas Eve, not because a little Christmas or whatever I know that'll get halfway on her good side you know, like you. Know i'm hoping, maybe she'll let me come up there."
207.0,Provider,"Well, and maybe that's a good way to bring it up to say like I know dad's cooking the big meal on Friday for Christmas, do you want me to cook Saturday."
418.0,Patient,"No, there you go. yeah."
207.0,Provider,"Not even ask just say, I want to do this for you guys for Christmas, can you let me poke you breakfast."
418.0,Patient,Right that's yeah that's gonna be like i'll come up here and get it all going.
207.0,Provider,I feel like that's at least then it's not you're not feeling as vulnerable because it's making it more about like i'm going to give you guys my top.
418.0,Patient,"Thank you guys breakfast. yeah. She yeah. I told you about the hips, a thing that i'd say about that. Now I tested positive for it."
207.0,Provider,Oh yeah you told me that again yeah yeah.
418.0,Patient,"i'm not mentioned it to her, because, like I know it'll be a whole another war like and. I don't know she said weird about stuff like I don't know."
207.0,Provider,Did you get treated for that yet.
418.0,Patient,"not yet no I need to go to that i've just kind of blocked it out really like to kind of until I sent her thinking about I was like oh my gosh you cannot be so careful, because if she found out that I knew I had to tell him to die, but like cooking for him, you know. But."
207.0,Provider,"We can it be, can it be transferred by."
418.0,Patient,"know you have to like. yeah like that, like. Later, but when I worked at what about this just a side note, but when I worked at. logans roadhouse and national and I lived in there and a halfway house this girl was cut lumens when morning kind of finger on the saucer blood goes all over the limit instead of throwing them away, they watched him up and serve as if you cannot do that I was like. She had it or not, but that was."
207.0,Provider,A summit crawl.
418.0,Patient,"yeah and I was like you cannot do that and I did anyway, but because there's a whole bunch of them like she was on the last one. I was like so even now, when I go to eight i'm like oh God like I don't think about it like that i'm like. I just a side note, but every time I guess I think about it it's hard for whatever, but she didn't know she had anything but she the blood went all over all these finished it off and serve him I was like oh my God."
207.0,Provider,Oh gross. Gross.
418.0,Patient,And one time they dropped a stake in the trash and recycling it they.
207.0,Provider,don't go out to eat in nashville it's what you're saying.
418.0,Patient,yeah pretty much no.
207.0,Provider,I actually don't go out to eat that much anyways but.
418.0,Patient,"I don't know because after I worked there, I was like. Like it kind of changed my whole outlook on. Going oh yeah a lot of serving jobs in my 20s and."
207.0,Provider,um I mean I never saw anything gross but I wouldn't put it past people either.
418.0,Patient,"yeah that's just the things that I saw i'm thinking, I wonder what went on, did I didn't say you know to me. Like. yeah. And like yeah I know about Washington means like nobody was like big and I don't know just. really like it changed my whole outlook i'm going out to eat religion."
207.0,Provider,not worth.
418.0,Patient,"That the one where she dropped it in the trash it was only like paper receipts like where they you know print out a copy of what's going on each table, but. yeah."
207.0,Provider,If a customer knew that that had had been there's only. send it back.
418.0,Patient,yeah oh yeah they were just. Like that lemon thing if I even if I own a day if I know that somebody had blood on my limit oh God.
207.0,Provider,"Oh. I would rather I just don't do well with blood period. Okay client got disconnected I am going to pause and just leave a little bit and see if she comes back. Okay, and waited a few minutes client did not rejoin so I assume either her phone died or lost Internet connection."
