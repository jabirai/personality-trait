14930.0,Patient,"It was weird and I can't even imagine like having more people, because that would have been so extremely draining on me that I would actually would have gone to bed afterwards."
324.0,Provider,"Have you been sleeping since last month, I was on the fifth so. How is how sleep."
14930.0,Patient,I slept until 7am one. Throughout this whole thing. and Actually i'm not a person that feels really good after natural a lot of red. And i've been away. For 430 this morning.
324.0,Provider,And how's your appetite them.
14930.0,Patient,"back and forth i've actually. eaten. I actually have also noticed. Some weight gain. In there's still day that i'm not female and I also have a bunch of Britain man at my house doing instruction right now, which is making me kind of uncomfortable for me, leaving my gates open and looking in the window. Looking at stuff everything that."
324.0,Provider,"Okay, so. Over the past couple weeks we met on October fifth. Have you stepped outside at all. Over the past few weeks."
14930.0,Patient,In my backyard.
324.0,Provider,But to do go outside.
14930.0,Patient,"my backyard has things on it, and I have kids all kinds of it set up like room so. One can say yes and one may not say yes at all. You know I did. Go out onto the front porch. And I cut some I actually cut it open up the trees and stuff so my front door is more open and my porch is more exposed now, so I get that. and Last night I actually went to. I actually not physically do that zoom. I actually zoomed into. A poetry music history, it had doctors and grammy award winners and poets, and all of that. I get involved, I guess. You know they put me on mute because that's what I asked for so radically as a wallflower but."
324.0,Provider,"me Okay, you were there."
14930.0,Patient,I was there.
324.0,Provider,You were there.
14930.0,Patient,"Just like I said, that is, the one thing that has helped me because, again. This is not a local thing that I needed to do I need this to actually be worldwide, the thing that I really wished to do. will require me to be able to reach out worldwide, not just down the street or something like that, and if I don't have to get on a plane and all of that other stuff. This works out. Perfect feed, so it does in fact helped me grow."
324.0,Provider,Okay sounds good so here's my question.
14930.0,Patient,Sorry.
324.0,Provider,"At are you. Are you are you at some point and it's not going to be overnight. As far as a goal wanting to be able to, if you want to go to the grocery store or you want to go to walmart or target or what or whatever it is. Not the to have to, but if you have one of those days, where you know what I feel like one walmart. And you're able to do that without. The extreme anxiety of leaving your House is that a goal that. that you would like to work towards."
14930.0,Patient,"If it's more specific than that there's really two things that will get me to leave my house. plants. So no that's not walmart that's a beautiful exotic nursery. With exotic plants because. that's that's actually my thing thing for real is that I by plants from around the world. My God. is rare is exotic it's serious that's The one thing that brought me out into the world first time the matter is is. It wasn't not even that was easy because plant, people are not. In rare plant, people are not nice people either they're extremely arrogant they're extremely sparingly are very, very serious a route, something that you would literally call a route. Can cost 150 bucks these people they they snatched from each other it's it's a hostile environment more than you can even possibly imagine, to be perfectly honest, so even doing that it's not as though I have not cry. just go get a plan, a beautiful plant and forget or whatever it is Hella konya whatever it is, though, I have not had to pull over to the side and shed some tears because wow that crazy person just nasty and you know ground and did this that and the other and all that other stuff. Nonetheless, i'm going to get that beautiful plant and i'm going to bring that beautiful plant hall. So that that plant can live or die that's not the problem that's not an issue it's not a concern because that life cycle. Is the action of getting it now is a lot easier for me to do that online too, because I don't have to go to Australia, you know or Singapore, or whatever that's with course. But sometimes I do want to go because yes there's a beautiful, you know nursery or something that's happening and it's only happening for a weekend in countless. or something like that I have been known to drive all the way to Mexico to get a get a ride my husband takes me because somebody takes me wherever I go, so no i'm not going to get in the car by myself. and go anywhere period that's that's what I do. period Well, yes, someone else should something like that happen absolutely the only other thing that is going to get me to leave my house. is having to perform. But even then someone is going to take me someone is going to show to me to do or me handle me that's actually what they call it a handler. Though I get home."
324.0,Provider,and
14930.0,Patient,Go back to be.
324.0,Provider,"Now here's The other thing. let's let's talk about the jury duty lawyer. dragon dragon on. It was not that I was not willing to write the letter. My thing was I didn't want you to join right heart. And only for the purpose of the letter. Because. I would like that we're able to you know even working with your therapist for us to be able to help you get over the anxiety of leaving home. That way, for example, if you want to go down to the nursery or have someone take you to the nursery that you don't have that fear there, that you will be able to go to help you overcome some of those fears that you have with leaving your home. And, and that was you know part of it i'm like I I don't mind a letter, but I would also like to help her. as well if it makes sense."
14930.0,Patient,"No, it does make sense I absolutely understand what you're saying, but this is not one of those situations that is going to. i'm not going to be fixed."
324.0,Provider,That within a month. And it's not kind of it no it's not going to be overnight it's not.
14930.0,Patient,"It is not going to be ever, because the fact of the matter is is that humanity is acting out. At even more of a crazy rate than they had been, as I said to you all in the beginning, there was a point in time in my life, where I was like. The the rare ones that people were picking like i'm walking down the street and suddenly somebody a stranger is pushing me in my bag and i'm flying through the air kind of thing now people or just acting out like that in abundance. you're just at home again look when I spent three years of my life not going out into the public. I did not sit here and not do anything I wrote books idea paintings, I did all kinds of things I recorded records, I put another album album with 22 songs. Bringing in 22 different musicians from around the world, now it wasn't just that I wasn't going outside, but also, I started doing TAI Chi I started teaching try to free to. Book because I realized that it was helping me that's the thing I teach people how to grow food I. donate I do fundraisers I do a whole lot of things for other human beings, and this is what I needed I needed one somebody to be there for me. Because i'm not going to be fixed it's not about me being fixed it's a one about how I react to. The assholes out there in the world, and I can turn my back, I can leave it I can breathe in deeply I can go do what i'm going to do, and come home and talk about it or not talk about it or write a song about it for doing a quick little. Three minute documentary whatever on it, or whatever, but what it does not change is the way people Act and the fact of the matter is is that that doesn't make me ill or anything, because I am fed up with the way people act now, I also have a very serious history. In this country, my family history in this country, I cannot stand the fact that people who suddenly become aware of Tulsa Oklahoma. I cannot stand the fact that people have suddenly become aware postal Oklahoma but not only that. They seem to not want to acknowledge the fact that those Tulsa Oklahoma was an Indian reservation that's what it was, those were not African. All of them was an Indian reservation so again, we have society doing things which they've been doing, not only did the government help destroy where my family has been. But now you know it's been suppressed and now suddenly so stupid TV show is talking about it, other you know, putting it on series, and all those things now again that's frustrating. I wanna."
324.0,Provider,"I don't wanna I don't want to start on time, because my next appointment is checked in. 11 minutes i'm."
14930.0,Patient,A little bit.

14930.0,Patient,So 30 minutes.
324.0,Provider,might be okay. yeah okay. Everyone is different.
14930.0,Patient,"up with those things Somebody needs to say those things right up front, because again i'm coming to. One get a piece of paper, but secondly to actually talk to someone so wait you get 15 minutes a day you got 30 minutes a day you get 10 minutes a day you get that that does it. And then, yet way you want to fix something about yourself. seriously."
324.0,Provider,"Okay, so. I want you to at least have my efforts are coming. To give at least give it a chance."
14930.0,Patient,I knew.
324.0,Provider,"Because I mean and again, those are the requirements i'm not attending the individual session not attending group session. Those are the requirements and bright heart will discharge if requirements are not met. um but you made that effort and I thought I just, I just wanted to at least give it a chance so. I am going to because i've seen the. And I think it's the end of November, the dates for the letter I am going i'm going to get it done today. But if I had already started on it i'm going to get your letter it's going to be brief, simple."
14930.0,Patient,that's all.
324.0,Provider,"Please excuse right but I didn't again. wasn't against the letter. I just want you to I want you to give the Program. So I am going to get delivered done today i'll let Nicole. In case management know as well. Okay, so matter of fact, she would have they would have in case management I send them the ironic, because they have to put it on the official letter here. They take care of all that and. Everything But just want me to write it out, I will take care of all."
14930.0,Patient,"Thank you, and I do actually actually under this band that you wanted to see and you wanted to help. right but program that says. Oh that's a word right within itself there holds so much power that is like wow you know."
324.0,Provider,"Okay, so."
14930.0,Patient,"As you can. See the baby, I really. seriously."
324.0,Provider,"No house, no, no, you say me i'm on easy with construction workers around everything how's your mood been. at any point over the past few weeks, any self harm suicidal thoughts at all. No okay okay."
14930.0,Patient,"That that person died. And I go i'm not that concerned about other people I left the water on them either. What this is actually proven to me is that I am more ready to become off grid than ever. that's what's proven and that's not an illness that's not a shortcoming or anything of that nature. When it comes to that and it's not impossible people do it all the time and they're happy, I simply just want to be happy and left alone and less stress that that's it that's all along. Like. me when I say group The thing is, is that when I go out and perform it's not just me walking up on stage and playing bass guitar singing keyboards what is it is also me listening to other people's bank because everybody's got things, everyone has things and. there's some things that i've learned just about. Music can give it an art has given me and out that most people will absolutely never have in their lives, it takes me around the world. In places that most people will never get to go it it opens up emotions of a song can change a person's life in three point whatever minutes and that's the truth. is not as though that group thing I do the group that. When I go out into the world I do the group thing that's why. I already know what that does to my body. And so, even to I don't know if that was weird to you all that that made me cry or what because i'm not even sure as to. where everyone is on certain things that humans. Experience and i'm you know i'm not saying that i'm better or worse i'm neither better or worse than anyone else. I do have a little bit of difference because. I strive to be different, I take the different road, I take the uncharted road I don't actually need someone to push me to do that that's what my entire life has been so I need a break. that's what I need I need it for someone to hold me someone to actually has me someone they actually say I understand, not to throw me into the midst of a bunch of other people and stuff because that's what I do. For a living, I suppose I am so vulnerable every time I show a painting or make a piece of jewelry or sing a song or whatever it is that I do, I am literally rebuilding every bit of myself to every frickin buddy out there to put me on blast any kind of ways they want to. see what needed one person I didn't need a program I didn't need to hear compliance or non compliance I didn't need any of that stuff I just needed one person. To just tell me that I could take a break, to tell me that I was working still be a lot of other thing that's what I needed. it's. So stressful. On a multitude of levels so rebels. And even now like I said I have construction workers here. Who. First, are not wearing a mask like normal."
324.0,Provider,Right put. I have two minutes I don't see when you check it to check into the virtual clinic first.
14930.0,Patient,"I just dial this number, and I believe that was the other thing not. On one which is the first time ever."
324.0,Provider,"Okay, I need to Okay, do you have a virtual clinic number, because you. Because I don't because you'll be counted as a no show if you don't check in."
14930.0,Patient,number. 7840 i'm sorry. 884-788-4714 11758847141 was.
324.0,Provider,"On one. So I want you to log out because we're out of time now, I want you to log out of here and just check in and i'm going to send them a message, let them know that I didn't see. It. Because I don't want them to do well, is boom."
14930.0,Patient,"Okay, so. A lot of."
324.0,Provider,"Money because I don't want them to. charge, you know she'll be thinking that you didn't show up."
14930.0,Patient,Thank you.
324.0,Provider,"yeah but i'm going to send them a message letting them know that you're going to come back and check in okay okay and. When I finished, I have a couple more people my next one is waiting i'm going to get there i'm going to get the letters sent over to them today, so they might have it. Did it today, at the latest, tomorrow, have a complete okay."
14930.0,Patient,"Thank you. Okay, followed guys, because I know that i'm a handful and I am going into the bond being a handful."
324.0,Provider,No. matter what.
14930.0,Patient,"No, I do because that's what I do I don't ever want people to think that I won't apologize, or they are you know say i'm wrong or whatever that's that's not who I am so thank you and I do apologize in have a good day."
324.0,Provider,"I accept your apology, even though it's not needed. But go check in. around her and send them a message and let them know that you were here."
14930.0,Patient,"Okay, thank you."
324.0,Provider,"Okay, all right bye bye. Okay miss out renting um. No changes with myself right now, prior to the group Tuesday, let me summarize this. and kind of the renton and Raven that. went on today was the same core group she didn't want to come to boot, and you know, and the only way she was here for the letter, and I was explaining to her today I didn't want her to come to the Program. So just to get a letter I would like, for us to be able to help her with her issues surrounding hardcore phobia um. And again, I still think she you know she's still resistant to group, but she did come, I am going to go ahead and I told her i'll go ahead, you know write the letter, for her for jury duty, but the fact that she made an effort. You know she's shown up for. Our meetings precision she's turned up with Ashley she did from the group so. i'm denies any as I still have her as not being a risk. i'm. Just like that she went on in her backyard and out on the porch so that's a little bit of an effort. She remains very perceptive on. kind of everything still some paranoia they're hyper verbal pressure to very tangential. def con keep. But man to get a word in. She went on a kind of a tangent about something about Oklahoma. um. So yeah no changes there. Like I said, the goal is still she's completely set up front, she will not take any medications. and her goal is just. I think really to get a letter I would like to see her continue. And track their work towards or. Something symptoms but to be saying this, all that I have for operator."
