For the pipe to their windshield. and They fucking and start threatening to kill me and start reaching behind their seat for something so I run off and they try to run me over, and then they drive down to my place while i'm not there and fucking run my fence down. And then come back and try to fucking like my place on fire, with my dog right there and. cheese and then my neighbors. caitlyn stopped him. Then, and then. Some person i've never even met before or heard of tells these people that i'm like a really good lifelong friend of his and that I hired him to kill them and oh God just got so crazy so. yeah I mean now it's all you know dealt with in and there's no, you know we don't have any problems so. yeah but I mean that all. just got fucking taken care of last night."
527.0,Provider,Cheese that so yeah sorry yeah.
4029.0,Patient,"yeah and then, at the same time, because, like. I had some people in my yard trying to creep up to my house and shit. I thought it was those people, so I had to go hunt those people down. yeah you know and then find out all these other things in in and get that whole thing squashed but then I still got these people. Out there in my yard I don't know what their I think actually I think it's COPs because there's this guy who. Everybody is all weird about nobody knows this guy and he's everybody started to ask him if he was a cop, when he was here like a couple months ago."
527.0,Provider,And he just just.
4029.0,Patient,"And when he was here. All this kind of people creeping around in the bushes at night was happening, a whole bunch. And then now he showed back up. And it's happening again, and like he's been telling people that he's like related to my family, and all this shit and nobody in my family knows him. And my family is the one that you know, like all the law enforcement are probably figuring are like the fucking people shipping in all these drugs, because they used. to be that way that's what they were before. And so yeah it's. it's it's crazy. yeah yeah. So yeah I haven't slept for. Three days."
527.0,Provider,that's not good okay.
4029.0,Patient,I mean.
527.0,Provider,So did they tear up any of your stuff like is it.
4029.0,Patient,"In the people last night. yeah um I haven't gone out and looked at my pickup out back because that's where I seen one of the people go. yeah and I haven't gone out there yet, so I don't know I don't know if there's anything missing because."
527.0,Provider,I was gonna say today is there anything stolen.
4029.0,Patient,"yeah I really haven't you know I haven't done done inventory on any of it, so I don't know. But I mean. It kinda like. i'm just trying to like assume that it is COPs because, if it is that's like the least danger. That you know I mean there's not anything they can do to me I don't know anything that they can try to squeeze out of me I don't have anything to do with any you know, like there's nothing they're going to accomplish and they're not going to harm me, so I mean. I can just hope, otherwise I mean if. there's like people who like this whole new breed of people who like to get all tweaked out. We call them. To get across a person's yard. or so. there's. It could be that type of person or it could be a person who's actually out to steal something. or it could be someone out to fucking light my place on fire. yeah and so you know, like i'm hoping that you know that it's a the least danger, but I have to assume that it could be F, or whatever the worst danger. Sure well yeah that is trying to you know. get other people to try to keep an eye out for you know flames and smoke and shit and."
527.0,Provider,yeah.
4029.0,Patient,"You know, and then people look at me like i'm fucking crazy and think that i'm all fucking tweaked out or something. me because I am more paranoid than most other people. And so it's yeah it's a it's a whole. When lose. yeah it's it's fucking nuts."
527.0,Provider,yeah it's getting crazy out there.
4029.0,Patient,"yeah it seems like like when did start raining like everybody, just like all hopped out of their little spider holes. Like they can't just sit there and and get wet and get cold, so they. go out and I guess get all high and start running around doing crap or yeah. there. It is."
527.0,Provider,yeah no kidding.
4029.0,Patient,"I mean, I guess i'm holding up as good as I could be. As I don't know i'll probably have to find somewhere to go tonight, or so it will showing go get some sleep somewhere, I was."
527.0,Provider,gonna say yeah yeah you look exhausted.
4029.0,Patient,Because what really I mean. Of course i've got a sense of danger I care about my well being but i'm I really worried about like dog.
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
4029.0,Patient,"that's what i'm always worried about you know i'm more like. i'm afraid to leave my place and not leave the dog there. Sure, because he keeps an eye out and he'll bark and I can hear him barred from a long ways away. Right, then I feel like i'm putting them in danger, every time I leave them there yeah."
527.0,Provider,yeah.
4029.0,Patient,"Like yeah I need this, I need to go fucking start falling for fucking social security again. Okay that's yeah I think that's you know the best option, I have right now, what I gotta do is you know i've got to get some way to be able to get a place that's not there."
527.0,Provider,yeah exactly.
4029.0,Patient,"yeah is something is going to. destruct at some point, you know go on and continue this way."
527.0,Provider,"So what would be, what can we do to kind of start get that process started for you like what."
4029.0,Patient,"I need to I guess start by getting a hold of Tony at the clinic. And she knows how I can get a hold of pat black. Okay, that was the lady who was you know she's the the guru of you know of applications for that. Okay, and if she's not available anymore, then I guess just. I mean. I can do is just you know she knows the ins and outs and and the best possible way to go about everything and. Sure fast track it all the application processes and yeah. I mean one guy that was in our group from beginning to end it was like three months."
527.0,Provider,Oh wow that's pretty well yeah well this guy's got a lot of weird social anxiety issues that are.
4029.0,Patient,"very apparent, so I was you know, makes a difference on his part, but I mean. From everybody's you know take on it, I shouldn't have that much of a you know. I mean. A lot of people get denied the first, second time, but I mean. yeah yeah everybody involved says that you know there's no like. I need it and we'll get it if I just put in the work."
527.0,Provider,"Sure sure yeah and if it would definitely get you in a place that feels safe and secure and. yeah you feel. You know that your dog safe. You know, because he's important well."
4029.0,Patient,"No, I think, if this big. And a fucking samurai sword and a crossbow."
527.0,Provider,It.
4029.0,Patient,"Was I just happen to come across these. As. dads all this crazy shit ramped up was somewhat. Of a crossbow to me and I actually was cleaning my trailer and bedroom the the bed. flips up and I had never gone and went down in there under there and. Then they're like few days ago, found the samurai sword in there. Oh, I guess it keeps you know some of the people at bay."
527.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
4029.0,Patient,"yeah I mean. You have to have a pretty damn good reason to go after the guy. Everything is there is one or two people out there, that in their minds do have reasons to you know, like the guy who carjack me and as like. killed my cousin. And all this shit you know I mean I figure I mean if he knows that I know these things about them, then i'm like a loose end. And then my cousin decided to like. Calling everybody from all the surrounding areas to this meeting, and like declare war against the guy base. And so yeah it's. like this is like. This guy's. Like kind of backyard, you know he lives down there and was doing all is that it's a bad bug. God wearing will come from. i've had problems with these the in the in the trailer there. that's I moved was one of the reasons I moved up into the top story."
527.0,Provider,Okay.
4029.0,Patient,"i'm starting to notice they're all over the place. I find them in a water places now. it's what it is, but all like what was all coated and so many people becoming poor. yeah like handout clothes and handout all the all these things being handed out, I mean. it's the perfect thing for these fucking bedbugs to be. At all over the place, totally. creeped me out. And that I wonder what you know what I almost died back last winter."
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
4029.0,Patient,"cuz I had these blood infections, I wonder how much of it had to do with those fucking things. And like I thought I was getting three bites because I got damn dog. And yeah probably was those things, I mean I know they do, there is one disease that they can give you but it's like it's a really obscure thing that I guess it supposedly only happens like down closer to Mexico and shit. Okay, and what happened to me doesn't fit that criteria, but what happened to me was basically just my immune system crashing from having numerous things giving me infections, you know. yeah having open sores and shit like that, and then I caught a stomach bug and Putin Putin puked until I was hydrated and you know my white blood cell count climb to where they said I had almost no red blood in my body. wow yeah and yeah so yeah it really freaks me out, I mean. it's another thing that makes me think about burning my place down and running. Because that's one of the ways. This is the only way to get rid of the damn things is you have. get them in like 155 degrees or above or use hell, a toxic chemicals."
527.0,Provider,"yeah yeah. yeah i'm not sure how did I know you got to Washington, you know in super super hot water, I think, and. yeah yeah. So honey, so do you think you can get in touch with Tony maybe tomorrow."
4029.0,Patient,yeah I should be able to.
527.0,Provider,"or by the end of the or by the end of the week, I mean tomorrow's Thursday like Thursday or Friday."
4029.0,Patient,"yeah I should be able to write a lot of it just depended on having my phone charged, but since i'm here right. Now, it should be yeah yeah."
527.0,Provider,yeah. Because I think that yeah let's see if we can get you going and get get something in place so that you can get maybe something. yeah. In the next couple of months or.
4029.0,Patient,"So right, and I mean with. With all the weather changing and everything I need to have something like that going on, anyway, just to. Keep depressed because, if I don't. If i'm not doing something. Making progress in my life and the weather gets bad like that. I get bad like. Like winter depression."
527.0,Provider,"Well, and if you're not sleeping that's going to just make it worse to. So yeah."
4029.0,Patient,"and your anxiety is going to be through the rough and. yeah and because a lot of times was the weather's bad and stuff I will and I get depressed I will sleep to escape from the world. And then. When I got this thing going on, I can't sleep."
527.0,Provider,yeah.
4029.0,Patient,yeah like I I started thinking about where's there a cave at.
527.0,Provider,yeah.
4029.0,Patient,yeah this I got the dog he's you know a lot.
527.0,Provider,yeah i'm glad I hope they don't try to mess with your dog because. yeah that. That would that would bother me for sure.
4029.0,Patient,"yeah yeah well one thing to that guy that that whole thing happened with he did not realize that I was related to the people i'm related to and then, when you found out you kind of like started shooting themselves. Oh, like my family's coming like. Some mob of this area. Like. So many kills my dog. They probably better move out of town. yeah. yeah they're killing me."
527.0,Provider,yeah.
4029.0,Patient,"Well yeah I don't think you know I mean that was just a. weird situation that just got out of hand, really. fast and that that's over you know yeah We talked through you know, neither one of us wants to have to fuckin even you know, have any more worries about any of it."
527.0,Provider,yeah.
4029.0,Patient,"yeah most of this one guy the guy killed my cousin he's I mean cuz he's a native so all never the stuff I told you about all the the you know the. The atrocities done in the neighbors, and so this guy is kind of like he's. he's got in his mind that he's like the catalyst for bringing about the fucking white to Indian wars. To get revenge for all these you know shit that was done to people who aren't alive alive, you know and so yeah it's. In a way, that kind of is one reason I kind of hope that the people out in the Bush is her COPs are raving fucking catch this son of a bitch and get them the hell out of it. Because you know he's. he's done plenty of other things, you know that i'm sure that you know they'd love to. fucking take his ass to wherever blocking something somewhere."
527.0,Provider,"Do you have any place you could stay like tonight, just to even get some rest."
4029.0,Patient,"Review so and remember what it was now. I mean the weather if it's if it's going to stay like this, I can. I mean. If nothing else, go to the beach yeah. yeah I gotta check the weather and then. And so."
527.0,Provider,casey's right.
4029.0,Patient,"Now yeah. yeah and also fears I think tomorrow or the next day and alicia are leaving to go to Vegas. So yeah that's that's a whole nother aspect, even if she didn't hate my guts still you know. yeah but yeah I mean at least have them with phone charged again I can try to get Ahold of people and see if they're you know any. Other and I just don't know. I mean, if nothing else, I can maybe you know go talk to somebody out nearby me and and see if you know I can just go sleep at their camp, or whatever, for a few hours just you know. yeah I know that there's somebody who's awake to will not let anybody get near me. Sure that's probably the most likely possibility it's just hard to sleep in those kinds of situations or. Just a big unknown."
527.0,Provider,"yeah yeah. yeah do you need to go check on your place today, at least, see if anything's missing or."
4029.0,Patient,"Oh yeah i'll definitely be going back to it. there's nothing else, I mean i'd have to get you know get stuff for him and blankets and whatnot. Try to. Try to secure the place, I mean it's like."
527.0,Provider,yeah.
4029.0,Patient,"can't say for sure that people steal my keys, but they are something that I lose more than anything else, and so I like it's gotten to where I don't even fucking lock my place half the time because I can't find my keys. And I don't. know that it's going to help anyway because, even if I can find my keys I can't find my spare he's so. yeah that's certainly talk Casey of our fee about getting the locks and giving him the spirit he's."
527.0,Provider,"gonna say, can you hide it can you hide this or keep a spare key at his place."
4029.0,Patient,"yeah well that's a talker so I need to get combination locks. i've just always been against combination locks because, like I learned to. break into most combination locks. But I mean there's certain types that I mean without like a stethoscope and shit like that you're not gonna so I mean. The likely. That is, you know. yeah nobody ever gets my damn door."
527.0,Provider,yeah yeah What about like a path like a padlock or something or would they just. Had a mom.
4029.0,Patient,I had I had padlock like place and there's actually a padlock and chain going through my wall right now but I don't know where the key is.
527.0,Provider,"You need it, you need a key a key chain that you keep around your neck around your neck or something."
4029.0,Patient,"or on your belt. yeah that's. What. You know and that's I used to have like like the keys, you know I used to have a program to where you know I my belt in my wallet in my keys. As soon as I got a bed they went on me and. yeah yeah just this whole being out there, and all this shit and. I swear i'm constantly just trying to fucking hole my bearings together. yeah trying to catch up with you know everything that I want to do is put second to trying to pick up the pieces of everything that fell apart yesterday."
527.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
4029.0,Patient,"And it's like yeah I need like it's like I need a fucking babysitters. But it's, not that I just need to create systems and stick to them. So yeah cuz I mean the babysitter's not going to tell me anything I don't know."
527.0,Provider,yeah.
4029.0,Patient,I was had my fence shit done and.
527.0,Provider,I know that's what I was just thinking about like how much damage is out there because you've been working so hard on getting things secure it out.
4029.0,Patient,There it's not it's not a giant section of it it's you know it's. Oh no I could probably fix it all in a day and just. get more would cut. The crap the screws to do.
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
4029.0,Patient,"But the words if I don't have it someone out there, probably does it get it from. yeah I mean it can get done it says yeah will I be able to get around to it, while trying to pick up all this other shit."
527.0,Provider,Now yeah.
4029.0,Patient,And I will just yeah. It. Things do move forward it's just you know a lot slower than I imagined every my head.
527.0,Provider,"yeah yeah. yeah. Well, I think I think getting in touch with Tony and seeing what you can do to get the least so security started, you know, maybe even this week or the beginning of next week. Especially before that, especially before the holidays roll around you know November, December and offices start closing and more and. yeah people slows down yeah. yeah definitely so."
4029.0,Patient,"yeah. yeah I think that's yes gotta be my main goal. and, probably, this is just knocked over to. Some of my back up. Well yeah so it's like splinters. yeah. yeah so that's me."
527.0,Provider,that's enough in that. i'd like to i'd like to see things settle down a little bit more and. It for you.

Like once or twice a year, it seems like everything in my life just. fucking blows all to hell. Like once once during the winter once during the summer, it seems like. yeah I guess. Try to figure out ways to prevent it. can't really prevent things like. fucking murderous dude."
527.0,Provider,But yeah I was gonna say goodbye being not in an area like that you know I.
4029.0,Patient,"i've been denied disability once and I didn't get on top of the you know the appeals. So if I had then maybe I wouldn't be in this. position, so I mean there's."
