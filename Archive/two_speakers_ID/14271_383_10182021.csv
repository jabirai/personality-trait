383.0,Provider,"Good morning. hi Can you see and hear me okay. Yes, okay good did you get my little message that said i'd be two minutes. nope Okay, I sent you a message in the chat That said, I was going to."
14271.0,Patient,"Go Okay, I had my phone down, so it might have shown, but I didn't see it."
383.0,Provider,"OK OK, I often wonder I send sometimes I have to send that message and I sometimes people see it, and sometimes they don't so."
14271.0,Patient,"was considered of you, thank you."
383.0,Provider,"Oh sure well. So how are you doing, how are thing how's your therapy going with your outside therapist and do you want to fill me in on how you've been these last since I last saw you."
14271.0,Patient,"Sure sure um i'm still seeing Sandra. and actually i'm not seeing her this week. Because she's on vacation. So it's convenient that i'm seeing you this week that's a nice happenstance. You know I I still see her every, Tuesday, at noon. we've been working on. Because i've been probably since July in another pretty low period we've been working on drinking enough day to day. Okay i'm working on my sleep. and Like trying the other. One is a. daily living or."
383.0,Provider,Activities of daily.
14271.0,Patient,"Thank you. Thank you yeah because those are always go by the wayside when i'm in a deeper. Depression and, for me, I sort of have. To I may have said this last time, but I sort of categorized my depression into two big D and little D. And little D. Is sort of what I deal with all the time and. But i'm still able to respond to text messages visit my sisters i'm still able to live to some degree, but big D is when I stay up in my room. don't engage with people and really let. My dishes go my showering go don't eat and drink enough or I eat too much, it seems I kind of do one or the other, when I have severe depression. is either not eat. or eat too much and there's no pleasure in either I mean it's just what happens to me I guess. But so back to Sandra. For about three months, I was slipping back into my bigger D over like the summer and it started to lift. i'd say maybe two to three weeks ago, and so, for the first time in like eight years, I read a book, which is something Sandra and i've been kind of working on. And so, as. Small as it sounds. At one point, progress was just reading an article. You know. So she was really proud of me, and I was proud of me my sisters were proud of me. When I. gave reading a chance and was able to maintain enough concentration and and all that. But. Besides, some of those things which she always checks in on will also just talk about sort of what's going on. Which is i'm. Like exactly what you're doing with me and so, if there's an argument with one of my sisters we'll talk about it. we'll talk about fun TV show i'm watching her podcast or. We also will always talk about this is one of the things she touches on every week, which is social interactions. and goals along those lines getting out of the House kinds of stuff, and so I had a little success with that in the last month, I went to my local library, I think, because I was starting to read again, and so I. updated my address, for my library card i'm about 10 months in my new city and bought a home here and I hadn't. gone to the library yet so I went and did that, and so that was my we call it things to do, social always say how are we on things to do you know. i'd also encountered a web APP i'm sorry and an APP called next door if you've heard of it."
383.0,Provider,"Yes, I have uh huh."
14271.0,Patient,"And so, in there one time there was a post by someone who was new to my town and she was asking for things to do. And so I harvested that post, so to speak, and I followed all the replies and I wrote them down and I talked about them with Sandra my therapist and I said, I think I may try some of these things, and so that's when we started doing the things to do, every week. And so the library was one of those things for me and. I haven't thought of one for this week. But I hope to win some of them are like. Various parks, people were recommending on local museums. Farmers markets things of that sort, you know, like free. Local activities. That kind of thing and so."
383.0,Provider,"Are you trying to do this, once a week."
14271.0,Patient,"yeah, at least at this point, and so I had in the last three weeks i've only been able to do one once but. Once it's better than none, and so this week i'm thinking about especially before the weather changes well I love it when the weather gets cooler but i'm hoping to make it to my local park and maybe take a walk. And just. Wealth one. Go to local part know a. New place but then also the benefits of exercise, which is tough for me i'm pretty sedentary. At this phase. which it doesn't help help either you know. But. So i've been oh go right ahead."
383.0,Provider,Go ahead.
14271.0,Patient,"Oh, I was just gonna say i've been responding to texts or phone calls, which is been good, I have a sister that happens to live about a mile for me. And we're. quite close and so I have been seeing her maybe once or twice a week and sometimes not for very long, but sometimes we'll spend dinner in the evening together and sometimes we'll just drop something off. But i'm i'm glad i've kept up with that, and then I also had another sister I have five sisters so maybe with time i'll name them for you, so I guess christy is the local sister. And then I invited my sister susie for a sleep over so, for she was here for two days. And we had. A good time and. And that was that was good that was her first time sleeping over in my new place. And where I felt good enough for it and."
383.0,Provider,When when did you have that flip over.
14271.0,Patient,"think it was October 9 10th. So it was last week. A week what nine days ago, or you know yeah."
383.0,Provider,mm hmm.
14271.0,Patient,"And then often when I have with chrissy and I, my local sister when we have a sister over will often invite the other to drop in. So, on Sunday morning for coffee. and Chris he came over for about three hours. A night and all that and then she's skedaddle back to her place."
383.0,Provider,"I see. Well, that sounds like quite. quite some good work you're doing with your therapist and you're following through your you know exploring some of these local areas and connecting with your sister and. So I think that those things sound sounds good sounds like you're kind of coming out of this low down towards the big D depression that you you're kind of coming up and out of that."
14271.0,Patient,Like that mm hmm.
383.0,Provider,"Oh, my God."
14271.0,Patient,me too me too.
383.0,Provider,What do you feel like. Do you think that you could add another little task to your your your things to do the things you're working on with. With Sandra is your therapist.
14271.0,Patient,i'm i'm open to suggestions. I mean if you have something you'd like to suggest i'd love to hear it.
383.0,Provider,Okay yeah I am I would love to see you getting a little more exercise. And some movement. Going in your body.
14271.0,Patient,"yeah she. Often. encourages me along those lines and. How do I. i'm. I often unless i'm in my deep depression, I my heart, usually is willing and then it's just the act of. pushing through to actually do do something. So. that's often been a goal between us for a goal for me is more movement, as it seems when I retired, which was about five years ago. For mental health reasons. But just my world got quite a bit smaller. You know, as often happens people but. When you're depressed On top of that, and. Recital and. You know, blah blah blah all the rest. So. Whether i've ended the movement doesn't seem to relate to wait because about two years ago I was in a non eating phase, and I was maybe 50 pounds less than I am now. yeah was it moving you know and was it and so that was Sandra was always encouraging me even just 10 minutes walk in your neighborhood and then just walk right back or dishes you don't even have to go to. don't even have to go to a park just walk up the street down the street, you know and now i'm in a phase of Wayne a bit more. i'm also still struggling with the movement. And, and all that. So I think that's a. great goal."
383.0,Provider,"Okay okay. yeah well, maybe I can give you some ideas. Sure just about how to approach it. so well, one thing that I do have a specialization in is movement and and yoga and I am a dance movement therapist and which is the psych psychiatric application of movement i've worked in Inpatient settings doing groups and guiding people and movement experiences. So I just really believe, and I believe it goes really well with mindfulness so you can think about it as mindful movement, you know we've talked about are in my group, so I try to lead. I mean I lead you guys in a mindfulness. And so, a mindful movement would be not it could be to go and take a walk but it, it might be just as effective for you to do it from home and to do you know some mindful movement, which means just some gentle stretching from your chair, or you know standing up and sitting down. there's there's such a thing as Chair yoga. which you can just do out of a chair and start to move your body and start to also connect with your body self on a. And kind of. reflect on what comes up for you, when you connect with your body I don't know if you've done any of this kind of work, because I know you've had trauma to your body, so there may be stuff that kind of comes up in relation to your relationship with your body."
14271.0,Patient,Okay.
383.0,Provider,What do you thoughts about that or just anything come up as I share with you now about it.
14271.0,Patient,about the trauma or about. The movement you care yoga and things.
383.0,Provider,yeah any of any of it.
14271.0,Patient,"Oh, I think it's. Wonderful I think it's needed for me, and I think. I. Like as you were speaking I was wondering if you might have. Any any handouts or flyer or anything you might be able to email me that or I can also just look up online like the Chair yoga and see if there's anything I can glean from there, but. You know I think it's. A. Good goal and something that's needed."
383.0,Provider,Okay okay yeah sure. So um.
14271.0,Patient,"And i'm not trying to put work on your plate, so if there's. If you think I should just try and find it on the web that's that's super fine."
383.0,Provider,"ya know I am just also was wondering if maybe you might want to know more about just what dance movement therapy is so that you can. Be sort of maybe. Get just get more information it's not that i'll do dance i'm just dance movement therapy, that the psycho therapeutic. application to movement."
14271.0,Patient,"i'm sure i'm very open to hearing more about it, I. hadn't gotten a chance and never came up before, but I was an Irish step dancer a competitive Irish step dance for for 10 years. Oh wow and. Award winning danced in Canada. Was and and then beyond that I think it. And that was from when I was five to 15. And I think, because I was so young, at that point, it. Just infused in me a love of dance. Oh, so one of my 20s when like country line dancing was the craze and I was down in. college, I would go dancing twice a week. And then learned salsa and. waltz foxtrot medan gay and just loved to dance, and when I would choose a form of exercise back in those years. It was always Richard simmons aerobics. Because he used music. And it felt like dancing for me. So it's been. part of my life more than in the past. But I think it's. it's a. Like dancing 10 minutes to music is definitely more enjoyable for me than walking 10 minutes. Absolutely no so i'm very. interested in in hearing anything more you want to tell me about the dance therapy idea."
383.0,Provider,Okay okay.
14271.0,Patient,That may be our hook amanda. That may be our hook.
383.0,Provider,"I know i'm like i'm like i'm amazed and well I. threw this out there and and here you are have a background in dance and we're dancing when you were younger so it's it's a little you know it's a spark in there. That that might you know help you to move, and as you move. and breathe and are in your body you feel more you know, often just more connected to life and also provides release of built up stress and tension it's activating, so there is this i'm just looking on YouTube now. it's a it says a chair yoga dance. And so there's going to be some different you ever wondered what. To do when they have to get. You know I would do you feel like you have the attention. Or the interest to there's a to actually go on line and find some different options."
14271.0,Patient,Of course yeah I think I can do that.
383.0,Provider,"Okay okay that's great because there's some different options here. there's it's called chair yoga dance and I haven't actually perused these, so I would need to. To do that, before I were you know I could recommend. One in particular, but there are several to choose from, and some of them are just five minutes long. Okay, I haven't looked at it, so I wouldn't know which one to tell you to do. But you could just type in chair yoga and then also chair yoga dance and see what you come up with, because I think if you. there's a chair yoga class it's actually 43 minutes, so you know that's then there's the five minute ones. Something that you can be seated so you can start where you are. huh oh. And then move from there breathe from there, and just see what happens to be great if you could do it a few times a week."
14271.0,Patient,"With me Oh, I thought I had my 10 Okay, and your. One of your specialties you mentioned before about dance was dance exercise I."
383.0,Provider,concur um no it's dance therapy.
14271.0,Patient,dance therapy okay look that up to just to learn more about it.
383.0,Provider,"yeah so the American dance therapy association, if you want to write this down."
14271.0,Patient,i'll go get my. American dance therapy association.
383.0,Provider,"Yes, okay. i'm so it's on the web@www.ad ta."
14271.0,Patient,Okay. got it. got it okay.
383.0,Provider,"So, as I look at your goals that we identified back in September, because. We you sort of self identified these as to resume your interest in your own life. To engage with other people comfortably. And to have a routine for self care. So do you feel like how, how are you doing with regards to the first one. resume and interest or have an interest in your own life."
14271.0,Patient,"I feel like that made improvement since last month, last month, I was. deeper in in my my depression so i'm. Like I made a date with my best girlfriend. To meet with her in the beginning of November, for her birthday and. i'm glad about that. You know. And so. I think i've made some progress and. feel like there's more progress to be had but i'm i'm moving in the right direction. as compared to last month."
383.0,Provider,"Okay, and then the second goal, which was to engage with other people more comfortably, how is that going."
14271.0,Patient,"haven't really engaged with any strangers. per se, except maybe medical personnel like when i've. I had a mammogram and talk to the attendant and that kind of thing. So. That one may be. Still. Well i'm. i'm taking all the calls from my family. Which is. is good. So that one may be a little improvement."
383.0,Provider,Okay.
14271.0,Patient,"Some of I fold into that some of the things to do, or like that weekly goal of leaving the House. And then. Knowing the locale or maybe talking to someone at a starbucks or that kind of thing so and those things I haven't been as successful in yet you know, like with doing that every week I did like one out of three weeks. So i'm. Hoping I can be more successful."
383.0,Provider,"With that okay one way of thinking about it is, if you. Go out, you know, on your one outing during the week you know whether it's like a farmers market or you know just go shopping that you remind yourself that you want to have one exchange with someone that you're out and about you know whether it's. accomplished compliment you know, giving a compliment or just making eye contact saying hello, that you were going to endeavor to initiate one social interaction. me out. Okay, and that you know, an eye contact and a smile that counts. You know, pretty simple you know and our hello, you know, and I think that these you know we underestimate the power of those small interactions to help boost our mood or how we're feeling if there's a tendency toward isolation. hmm underestimate the power of those little little interactions. I know for myself, I live by myself and. I go out and this weekend, you know watched my dog at this, you know I I it's like I gathered those little interactions. And they really, really were lovely you know if I think back on it, even in the moment you know, is able to say wow That was really a nice interaction I just had with the trader joe's. shopping person and."
14271.0,Patient,yeah.
383.0,Provider,"And it's part of life, you know if we don't just interact with our friends and family, we also interact with people here and there, and it kind of it's kind of be kind of prize provides variety it's kind of can be kind of you know, interesting."
14271.0,Patient,Okay i'll. i'll keep that in mind for the when I leave.
383.0,Provider,"Okay okay good and then the routine for self care, you said that your ideals are. Are."
14271.0,Patient,"struggling. yeah and that. that's true for big D and little D. It just seems. To be. really difficult in my last home, I have a lot of trouble doing my dishes. And so they would pile up. And with time even sometimes smell because old for food goes bad you know and things like that. And so, when I moved into this place 10 months ago I said never, never let the dishes set you know. And for about the first six months my sister chrissy lived with me, she was saving up. And, and so, since she's been gone and she very kindly largely did the dishes for us. But since she's been gone i've kept up that promise or that goal to myself and. I feel like i'm almost taking it sort of like quite literally or something like you know you must finish those dishes before you go to bed. or all kinds i'll just do them right after using them i'll rinse them off clean you scrub them with soap and let them drip dry i'd have a dishwasher but I usually just drip dry and. So I may be getting a little stern about it, but I feel like the net benefit is worth it, you know. cuz cleanliness is it's good for us. and For about three months, I was having real success with the showering. And was showering like twice a week, like every Wednesday every Sunday. And Sandra and I were just so. pleased with it, and then, when I get back down in my depression in July got very difficult again and so. i'm. i'm still working on that again and I think I want to. Try and remember the feeling of accomplishment or the the benefits of it. You know, like trying to find a way to pierce through my depression, to get into that shower. You know um. And so. Like my sister christy is very compassionate about depression our our father had depression. Right um and chrissy is just very compassionate about what i'm going through so she was here. A week the week ago, I guess, and while she was here she was really encouraging me take a shower while i'm here you'll be done in 10 minutes, and then we can continue with what I what we're doing and it took her like 20 minutes of kind of softly. Pushing you know, and then I was able to do it. and I feel like I wish I could have more success in talking to myself about it. I see you know. And and and all that. And plus you just you have you smelled better and your hair feels better and your. Let me for all the basic reasons it's not like I need to be convinced it's good and hygienic. it's I need to pierce through those feelings of depression. To just get in that shower."
383.0,Provider,"Right right right. um well, one thing that might be helpful, is, if you did the movement that started during that if you started to do the Chair yoga and then. and start and just do a move like as if you were going, you know doing it, the gym you know you take a shower after your exercise if you were did. You know chair yoga twice a week to start and then tell yourself after I do the movement after I do the exercise after i've gotten my body kind of connected to my body and, just like in just just you know it's a shower is about washing your body. and use in the experience of the water and it's a bodily experience that you're going to prepare yourself by just getting in touch with your body, because I think part of what's happening is that you're almost disassociated from your body in your depression."
14271.0,Patient,You don't have a.
383.0,Provider,"You know you're disconnected and or don't have really a relationship too much with it, you can correct me if i'm wrong, you know when you're in your depression."
14271.0,Patient,No you're right on.
383.0,Provider,"So if, by doing the movement by connecting to your body by and all it takes is literally I mean we can start one can start by you know just. Spending you know five minutes of being with your body, you know reaching stretching you know even putting hand lotion on you know doing a little self massage. Giving yourself up you know so there's all kinds of movements, you can do you know to start to be in your body and connect to your body and then after that you will stand up and take your body to the shower that you've already started to connect with. With moving and breathing. So maybe think about that think about that as maybe. A way. In effect, like a treatment plan for this problem of showering regularly."
14271.0,Patient,Okay.
383.0,Provider,"To start with, coming into contact with your body and giving it some time and attention. And that dissociation to. Like when you're saying dissolve you know pierce through the depression part of that is to bring the dissociation. down and to connect with yourself and your body. How does that sound to you."
14271.0,Patient,"Oh it's certainly sounds reasonable and I will. Try an animate myself for that, I mean it sounds. doable I mean it's not like you're saying okay sure i'll take a 45 minute walk every day and then shower after that every day it's like you're not keeping on something that's unreasonable, you know so i'll. definitely make that a goal."
383.0,Provider,Okay yeah. You could as you're looking through these chair yoga dance options and even watch it watch it without doing it.
14271.0,Patient,mm hmm.
383.0,Provider,"In fact, you know the sports sports medicine sports psychology when an athlete is and you may have already heard this. let's say they're injured or they're not able to do their workout the their recommendation is to watch movies watch their their game watch their whatever it is that they do you know whether that's. soccer but they watch it intently they watch the other people moving. And there's a part of your purpose receptive. Inner eye, that is actually tracking those movements, even though you're not doing them. hmm and so you're starting to kind of, so I would recommend you watch some of these first and you look at them and you just watch it passively. And you start to kind of. train that way mentally with the other people doing it, and then, then you set aside time to choose one and then you're going to do that one, and you can watch it a bunch of times before you decide to do it or before you actually do it. But, of course, that. More lived experience is going to be when you actually do the movements."
14271.0,Patient,mm hmm.
383.0,Provider,But watching them is worthwhile also. Okay well um so in terms of your suicidal thoughts Where are you.
14271.0,Patient,With haven't yet none in the last month.
383.0,Provider,"Okay okay great that's fat that's wonderful. yeah that's really, really great. And how are the groups going for you."
14271.0,Patient,"Oh, I really enjoy them, I know, at some point, I can pare down if I want. But like I was telling him Sandra I said I really like it, so I don't see myself wanting to pare down. I like. hearing what others are going through. I like hearing what's successful for other people. And I like just knowing, there are other people in my situation. You know, and so. i'm i'm enjoying it and it's lucky that it's a convenient time on the 11 o'clock Friday. And that's that's really convenient. For me so. i'm i'm enjoying it."
383.0,Provider,"that's so great i'm so. yeah and people do really get they feel less alone when they are. You know, and I really love that one of the group members on our last call I think they they they kind of validated your the showering struggle, you know. and"
14271.0,Patient,yeah I was surprised after that um I think there were maybe for other people that made a mention to it and. I thought that is the essence of group therapy is getting. Understanding or strength from others. You know and i'm. And i'm glad that I. was willing to be that open I guess. And so yeah that was. That was nice. It was nice.
383.0,Provider,"that's so great yeah and I think that your willingness to step out and and really you know kind of reveal one of your struggles. was a big part of that. So that that gave sort of permission for other people to come forward and. You know, acknowledge your struggle and also share some of their own."
14271.0,Patient,mm hmm.
383.0,Provider,"So yeah, thank you for that."
14271.0,Patient,Oh sure.
383.0,Provider,Is there anything else that you wanted to talk about today.
14271.0,Patient,"No, no, I think we've we've covered a lot and. I definitely want to I wrote down about the the Chair yoga and. organization, the American dance therapy and I think i'll do some research on that. And I think those are great suggestions and, especially, if I can somehow put myself into exercise shower you know. kind of thing I think that's. A good. goal to have."
383.0,Provider,"Good good yeah and when you're doing the exercise it's it's more than exercise it's connecting to your body. And feeling your body and notice if there's judgments, if you have judgments about your body notice, you can write those things down, and we can talk about it, or you can talk about it with your therapist you know. What comes up for you, when you connect with your body when you start to move, and when you break that association and you just start to be present, with your body stretching."
14271.0,Patient,"The right. Okay, just wrote note feelings about body so okay."
383.0,Provider,"yeah take note of the feelings. And then, as you're. You know, when you put aside the time to do the exercise and the shower. it's all about movement a shower is about movement. So movement time to do your movement and then you're going to move off the Chair into the shower you know to attend more to your body."
14271.0,Patient,On the mark.
383.0,Provider,"You know, we move the body, then we clean, you know. Whatever. You know, but it's going to be part of."
14271.0,Patient,The process and.
383.0,Provider,"yeah. Okay, so do you feel like i'm seeing you quarterly or seeing you every other month because I saw you in September. let's see when was our appointment let's see here. This is our first actual therapy appointment your your other. Your intake session was in September so it's monthly that i'm seeing you."
14271.0,Patient,mm hmm.
383.0,Provider,"Okay, was that works for me. It was that your understanding."
14271.0,Patient,"yeah that's what I remembered, but if you need to alter it that's Okay, but once a month feels good."
383.0,Provider,"Okay, let me just quickly look here what we had. Okay, generally, it said that your therapy is managed by an outside provider. But I can so we can do you know we could do it every month or every other month, depending on what you feel is you need."
14271.0,Patient,"Okay, could we try every month. Maybe for the beginning. Because i'm still feel kind of new to bright heart."
383.0,Provider,"yeah and we're working on some you know you're working on some important stuff if your depression was kind of worsening last month, we want to you know not we want to support you and pulling out of that. Okay The other thing that I think that I said about when you go out as a goal is to."
14271.0,Patient,make contact with someone. We put that down. Or have a meaningful exchange I think that's how you put it. With someone. When out. Okay.
383.0,Provider,"Okay, so and no."
14271.0,Patient,reasonable to.
383.0,Provider,"Okay okay good i'm glad it doesn't feel these don't feel like they're too extreme. And, and that they're doable that's what this. that's what's important or that you feel like there you can reach toward it. Okay. So November the 22nd or the 29th I don't have any morning appointments on the 22nd available, but I have some afternoon appointments, I have a to C three o'clock appointment on the 22nd or. That would be about three weeks from now or mean a month from now."
14271.0,Patient,sure that sounds great.
383.0,Provider,"Okay, so would a three o'clock on the 22nd work for you."
14271.0,Patient,"You know what day the week, that is."
