5155.0,Patient,"I agree, and weird thing is Dr mobile like so it's been almost a year and a half now but she's the one that initially got me started on braveheart."

5155.0,Patient,"i'm is the hospital that I went to and she was the only one in the er that was able to recommend or like subscribe or prescribe a the printer freeing and so she was the one that initially got me started on. yeah like. To bright heart and. Every so it's I told him like she's really sweet she you know, like when I first started with it the my boss he's like okay well just let me know. Let the doctor send me an email, making sure you're good to return to work like when I had when I had gone to the emergency room and the date on top of it she's she's amazing so. glad that, and I hope he's six was it the only thing that like kind of made me upset today was like he asked me because he had to do his blood work test. And i'm. i'm like well, I have a 1030 appointment with Lisa I said, and then I have like obviously the girls running around picking them up dropping them off picking up my oldest daughter's friend her on dropping them off at the mall and then picking them so."

304.0,Provider,All the.
5155.0,Patient,"Time like. Maybe it's just me and i'm just like not seeing it, but like if you're really exhausted or tired like. I know what it looks like. But he nods out."
304.0,Provider,You know what I mean yeah.
5155.0,Patient,Maybe it's just me like just because i'm. i'm not a big fan of his you know what i'm seeing.
304.0,Provider,"But that's definitely like. More than I mean it's 1030 in the morning 930 in the morning, like that's more than just you're still asleep."
5155.0,Patient,"Like in the The thing is, like he does work nights. But, like last weekend, he literally slept pretty much all Sunday or all Saturday, on Saturday night pretty much the whole day. Sunday like a normal, not a normal person that's the wrong freezing, but like like i've been tired, you know what i'm saying like working running around doing this doing that i've been tired and it's just like. I don't know like I said I know what it looks like if somebody nods out, and I know what it looks like if somebody. is tired. Maybe i'm just being negative just because, like I said i'm not a big fan of his I didn't say anything but i'm like. I told you, I can take you you just texted me. he's like well I kind of want to know when you could take me, so I can go sleep or Beauvoir and i'm like okay fine I can take you in 10 minutes i'm waiting downstairs in the car to take them. he's not coming down I come out and he's like in this weird position like just like sleeping and i'm like dude you literally just texted me two seconds ago. When we can go."
304.0,Provider,"Oh no well, he is on the suboxone and he's taking it like he can't get high you know, and so, hopefully that will just that he'll keep taking it and kind of realized like oh this didn't even do anything for me."
5155.0,Patient,I don't know if. Like I know I picked.
304.0,Provider,"up my friend, when I got mine."
5155.0,Patient,and I don't know if he's taking it if he's not really I don't know I don't know if that's why he didn't come downstairs. See now my mind is thinking. Maybe we can come downstairs because he doesn't want to go do as bloodwork baby because. Through the pee test or whatever like that's all.
304.0,Provider,He goes yeah so. Christine to kind of segue into that I don't want to add more to your plate but um.
5155.0,Patient,So I.
304.0,Provider,"Thinking of the uds. We got an email from our medical director Dr shorter shorter boy yay. I don't know if you've heard us mention his name before. So, and this was several people in group, like they're really kind of their auditing, like all of our chart everyone's charts so you haven't had a uds in like 200 days."
5155.0,Patient,"I know this is the thing and I hit so Dr holtz heard about that, before and i'm like I used to get them sent to my house like and I haven't gotten one so."
304.0,Provider,What I don't need you.
5155.0,Patient,sent me the link so i'm going to set something up.
304.0,Provider,"Okay, so here's what's happening and we put you on quarterly because you were doing well. You were on quarterly but you're 265 days."
5155.0,Patient,Past right right.
304.0,Provider,i'm quarterly. So I mean you need to call or go to that link of virtual clinic.
5155.0,Patient,"yeah No, of course, and then I can go to wherever I need to go to and I get."
304.0,Provider,It so send it to me then i'll go to wherever you guys need me to go to to do the urine sample. yeah they might they might want you to go in person sorry i'm just looking for my coffee. They might want you to go. In because it has been so long.
5155.0,Patient,"No problem, not a problem."
304.0,Provider,"Was was there, something that were you just thinking you weren't getting the cups or what what was going on that."
5155.0,Patient,"Well, I had asked. Like why haven't gotten to something, because I used to get it in the mail I would check in with a virtual clinic I do it, I do it, and then I like showing like the cup on the. Call. Then I stopped getting it and. i'm like. Maybe it's because they've been. With you guys for so long, and like going to the meetings and keeping up with like our stuff like. Otherwise, maybe. They don't do it as often maybe it's because insurance doesn't cover it as often now I honestly I wasn't sure."
304.0,Provider,"Okay, but at that point that would be the time when you would need to call virtual clinic. Okay, and. So we did put you on quarterly because i'm. Like you were doing well, and you have spaced it out. They want you to get a more frequently now. i'll probably monthly. But I think yeah, especially if he has to go to the lab you guys just go together. To quest. i'll let Dr hopes for it no."
5155.0,Patient,"Oh, I emailed him this morning already."
304.0,Provider,"You emailed him this morning okay good good. yeah okay. yeah and it worked out because I told him I was going to meet with you anyway. So I think I don't know if me hear the same thing from everybody like I didn't get a cup I didn't get a cup I think people are not understanding, like the reason is, if you miss a certain amount like then it triggers that you have to go to the lab."
5155.0,Patient,In person so. there's like I said there's. there's. One right down the street from me at least you're in general um. So I don't know like Do I need like an order will i'll call the virtual clinic and ask them what.
304.0,Provider,"yeah yeah if in a some if they say that you do need an order then Dr Steve can put it in. So yeah it's not yeah it's not just you, but I think once one, two, if they do say you have to go in person. will put you on monthly and then what will happen like so I don't know what day of the month, they send it. Like so what's today the the 12 so maybe the next one would be around December 12, but they should send you an email like it's kind of like a shipping notice."
5155.0,Patient,"That it said, like I would get an email, and then it said, you should have received your. Like the package or whatever it came in Manila envelope, and there was the company. So I was just. Like I honestly it's, it is my fault for not like following up with it more, but like it used to come pretty. consecutively like on."
304.0,Provider,"Time yeah So if you skipped some, if you like, just didn't do it, then it it stops and you're supposed to go to the lab. So. So I think that maybe wasn't communicated to people, but once you yeah so I go saying once you go to the lab and person get it done. we'll put you on monthly and then you'll get those shipping notices and so it's going to say like your Cup is on the way, if you don't get it within a week that would be the time to call. And figure out like well, it was delivered like I can see, on your chart you know so called virtual clinic they'll see on your chart like nope it was delivered on this day and you're like well I don't know my neighbors stole it."
5155.0,Patient,they'll send you another I live in. and
304.0,Provider,"But if that happens, a lot so, but if that's happening a lot again it's like well okay you're not compliant with getting your uds cups at home you're going to have to go to the lab."
5155.0,Patient,"And I can. Honestly, if it's easier i'd kind of rather go to the lab. Just because I don't want to have that like on my I know it sounds weird but like I don't want to have it like on my chart that like Oh, she got up she didn't do it like i'd rather not have that if it's easier for me to go to the lab I don't mind doing that either. I don't know I honestly I don't know what's easier I just I don't want to like have it on there that like it got sent she didn't get it just because during the day he's home. Now he's has a probation officer, so I don't know if he's going to try to see if, like. You know, try to use the urine sample or trying to see us like the cup thing or I don't know I don't know because I don't know if he just didn't give me the mail. Because my mom would look out for it, too, because she would see that I would get those Manila envelopes and she's like oh i'm like I don't know, maybe because i've been doing for so long, they. are not."
304.0,Provider,"So we're going to put you on monthly um. I mean that's. Normal the normal processes, you get that email confirmation you get the cup like I mean, I think the mail usually works for 95% of people, so I don't know why, like 80% of our patients aren't getting the cups when when you know they get the rest of their mail. But if in, then you need to do it like within a day or two of receiving it in the mail. Okay, like it's. going to trigger that you're overdue if. Let i'll have to figure out how to like change that in the system, but I mean if you're saying that you want to go to the lab every month. I don't see why you couldn't."
5155.0,Patient,"know I said I just I don't mind I just don't. Know it's just like I don't want it to show up that I missed it, you know what i'm saying."
304.0,Provider,"Right, I mean if you miss it it'll show up that you missed it. yeah I mean if they send it and you don't do it like we're gonna be back in this situation again and, like basically they're telling Dr holds for to shorten your prescriptions. You know so it's going to be just really more inconvenient for you to have to like go to the pharmacy more often basically that's kind of like the only like lawyer that they sort of have on you right."
5155.0,Patient,"Well, I think that true is it like I said i'm going to do whatever I have to do to like. Make sure everything's paid so."
304.0,Provider,So what So do you want me to put something in your chart that you're going to go in person like going forward.
5155.0,Patient,um.
304.0,Provider,Well i'm going to call it a meal.
5155.0,Patient,"When today. or i'm going to call them and see when I can set up to go in person. Get. on track with it. and We can try the monthly thing if, for some reason I don't get this Cup, or if it doesn't come in, or if I don't get it be a male because, like I said i'm not the one that gets some mail. And i'm not saying that the mail like that there's something wrong with the mail i'm just saying, sometimes I don't get my mail because he's home he grabs the mail and he gets all that it doesn't get to me. that's what i'm saying like you know so. By that, if that doesn't work like within the next two months, then i'll just go in person, because I don't want there to be any room for air."
304.0,Provider,"yeah that's kind of like I mean we do the uds cups just because it is a telehealth program so it's like we do the virtual therapy from home, you can do your uds from home but that's also part of like your deal is that you can safely receive your mail. So yeah I appreciate that that if if you kind of think that's not going to work that yeah that you can go in person, so. Okay, so I will, I will just notate that in your chart but yeah call virtual clinic that way they can make sure that the orders are there because I don't want you to show up and and not be orders so. Okay, thanks for doing that Christine yeah let's hit our next next appointment and, if you want, I can do earlier. Better."
5155.0,Patient,yeah maybe.
304.0,Provider,"In me it's like before the holidays, I know thanksgivings coming up, but let's meet in like December. house. House like December 17 is a Friday."
5155.0,Patient,yeah.
304.0,Provider,that's good okay.
5155.0,Patient,And what.
304.0,Provider,Better for you.
5155.0,Patient,We can do like 9am or 930.

5155.0,Patient,"sounds good, thank you."
304.0,Provider,"Sure, have a good day. bye."
