298.0,Provider,I don't hear anything.
17742.0,Patient,"Oh yeah actually. Oh yeah oh. yeah just give me one SEC. Yes or micro dosing with that. When that shows up he explained it to me when I talk calm, you can also do it the right way, if you want I just recommend that you're sick like really like you have. three distinct withdrawals sentence before you take the medication, because otherwise you go into precipitated withdrawal, do you know, do you know what that is. yeah it's like if you're high if you're if you're on fat take it. You don't send you with a withdrawal. So you want to wait. Before okay. As long as you're aware of that, though yeah you know."
298.0,Provider,What do what john's feel like for you.
17742.0,Patient,it's more irritating anything else feel it and just I mean like just runny nose and just era just irritating.
298.0,Provider,Have you been on a ne ne products before like suboxone stuffing attacks. yeah when what when was the last time.
17742.0,Patient,Maybe a couple months ago.
298.0,Provider,"you're not currently on methadone correct, have you done methadone in the past. Okay, and how did the medicine work for you the suboxone in the past."
17742.0,Patient,it's worth it's worth it was just me not um you know. showing that you know it was just me just showing back up and getting it again.
298.0,Provider,"You said 11 1968. Or was it 11 911 1990s okay. um so with the micro dosing you continue to use alongside of taking the main ingredient in which is called buprenorphine and there's no naloxone added it. But by the time one week is over, you are on the suboxone completely some people like it, because they don't feel the withdrawal symptoms as much other people feel that it's not. it's not fast enough for them so but it's up to you if you'd like to try it for a week to go on slowly or, if you would like to abstain from drugs for a minimum of like 24 hours, four days is the. ascent know is leaking out of your fat and so you can be in withdrawals for up to four days, because fentanyl is so much. Staying in your fat and leaking out. What are your thoughts."
17742.0,Patient,I think I smoke smoke this morning hard.
298.0,Provider,"Okay, and we that's okay i'm just asking do you want to do the little tiny doses and smoke for a few days and get yourself onto the medicine quickly or do you want to abstain and then go on it at bigger doses."
17742.0,Patient,"yeah i'll just rather i'd rather i'd rather just do it, I mean i've already i'm ready to do it."
298.0,Provider,"Okay, so if if and when you do get sick just know that you power through it, because you'll get on this medicine okay and. i'm looking at what you were on before and you were on three films a day, not very not for a very long time did that work for you three films today, or is it too much."
17742.0,Patient,"It was all right, but I mean all while. Back to smoking."
298.0,Provider,"Exactly now three films, is my top dos you you do get saturate the opioid receptors at two films a day, but some people feel like they need that third film so i'm going to go ahead and give you three films a day. and Basically I would start it and cut them in half put them under your tongue, let them completely dissolve nothing in your mouth 15 minutes before. 15 minutes after you can swallow it after it's completely dissolved, but it really doesn't do any good the it's absorbed through the mouth, so the longer that you can. have it in your mouth dissolving like up to 15 minutes, the better the easier it is. Not better, the better it is for your system, the more you'll absorb it. hmm is there anything I have not asked you, that would be really good to know about you."
17742.0,Patient,A phone number.
298.0,Provider,Okay. i'll make sure that they get that.
