386.0,Provider,Start time for 34 pm. I Patrick my name is mj and one of the prescription coordinator medical assistance i'm going to send a request for you to start your video here okay.
5599.0,Patient,Oh gotcha.
386.0,Provider,Sometimes it's a little bit easier to get a request when you're on a.
5599.0,Patient,Go flip the camera there.
386.0,Provider,"We go perfect i'm mj i'm one of the prescription coordinator medical assistance on staff i'm going to go ahead and get things started for you on. I spoke with one briefly about your case here, and so it looks like we're requesting for suboxone and then the adderall prescription was sent in already today, so you should have an adderall sent over to the rite aid pharmacy on 310 West lake street in mount shasta already. But the suboxone just wasn't completed through so um is suboxone the only met that you're needing currently. Correct Okay, and I have your strength of medication, as the suboxone and the strength of the eight milligram dash two milligrams sublingual film and you're currently dissolving that three times a day."
5599.0,Patient,Correct.
386.0,Provider,"yeah Okay, is that brand name that you're taking."
5599.0,Patient,It is.
386.0,Provider,Why.
5599.0,Patient,"yeah I tried, like the tablets or whatever, and, for some reason they make me just super sick."
386.0,Provider,"Sometimes, when you go back from the tablets versus the films if you're not spitting out that excess saliva after letting it dissolve, whether it be buechel or underneath your tongue, it can cause you to have severe upset stomach cramping and diarrhea nausea. vomiting Those are all symptoms of that medication not being taken properly so anytime, no matter what type, whether it be the tablets or the film's make sure that you place it on for the film's you're just placing that underneath your tongue correct."
5599.0,Patient,"Correct yep. All right, yeah please. The films i've never really had a problem with, I think it produces much of the saliva is the tablets do, for some reason."
386.0,Provider,yeah and it's better always so what I highly recommend is just making sure that you take like a SIP of water first place it underneath your tongue. Once you place in underneath your tongue you let it dissolve it usually takes the film's dissolve pretty a lot quicker than the tablets do I will say that you don't have that great feeling. So 1015 minutes for the dissolve and then with any excess saliva I recommend spitting it out into the sink taking a swish of water swishing it around your mouth and then spreading that out to that's just to prevent. prevent any any type of upset stomach. The last when was your last dose of the medication.
5599.0,Patient,When I woke up this morning. was my morning so around one.
386.0,Provider,Oh yay.
5599.0,Patient,yeah work super late.
386.0,Provider,"And so that was like a early am and then, when are you currently experiencing a type of withdrawal symptoms."
5599.0,Patient,"Oh no not at the moment, like my next dose is usually a six or seven o'clock."
386.0,Provider,you're a night owl. Where you work at night.
5599.0,Patient,yeah yeah my main like. Work block is like nine at night till three in the morning.
386.0,Provider,"got it. So know where to draw sometimes any recent relapse of any kind, using opioids heroin methamphetamines."
5599.0,Patient,nope. No relapse now think about a year and eight months.
386.0,Provider,yeah congratulations that's a huge accomplishment. that's huge.
5599.0,Patient,yeah haven't slept one time.
386.0,Provider,"You know it, it takes failure in order to succeed and i'm sure that you took so many steps to get to where you're at To begin with, so should be proud of that accomplishment is huge. Absolutely, and so, with the suboxone eight dash two milligrams sublingual film what is, as I review your chart. looks like you're currently enrolled in our program for opioid use disorder, as well as you're working on consistently as well, doing some type of daily activity. The care intensity recommendation right now is that your current group therapy appointments are at twice a month and then your current individual appointment therapy is twice a month. But because of your recent no shows what it's recommending is that it be changed to a suggested group frequency is three times a week and then your suggested individual therapy appointment frequency is twice a month. because she didn't tell was sent in the prescription request for the adderall today and she sent that in for you and gave you a two week supply my suggestion is just to follow up with her in regards of wanting to know like. Is it necessary for you to be seen three times a week or can we just kind of override this okay."
5599.0,Patient,"i'm gonna be doing, like the I think she's when said it was like that care group or whatever Monday."
386.0,Provider,yeah so and I tried getting in touch with you prior so um would you actually be able to do a care group tomorrow morning at 7am.
5599.0,Patient,"I wouldn't be tomorrow I wouldn't be able to do it, I got a busy schedule like i'm going to be working pretty late tonight and then yeah. super busy all day tomorrow but Monday I the 1pm one I could be there for sure."
386.0,Provider,Okay um and then did you complete out the band seven your surveys that you typically would have done.
5599.0,Patient,"yeah I did, I want to say three surveys and then I did the video compliance one also."
386.0,Provider,"Perfect we'll just pull that up here so um and that's fine I was trying to see if you're able to come up tomorrow that way because you're. The prescription recommendation right now is a two day supply, with no additional refills. And so, when when came over she's just like she's like well the next care group is on Monday i'm like the next care groups tomorrow, and so I was just like she's like can you message them and see if he'd be able to do that i'm like absolutely and then they just didn't. They didn't respond back to me in time, so you are already over here so. no big deal um let me bm seven so I got the band seven today I got the program compliance video questionnaire the PQ 9am new to the uds for us, I appreciate that and your acl surgery, you did all of your stories today and the uds so thank you, thank you, thank you so much for that. makes my job, a lot easier."
5599.0,Patient,yeah I feel bad the last couple of months for me with my job or my business has just been freaking crazy and yeah.
386.0,Provider,"I get it i'm here I I literally told when she's like can you will lock your room, we have one more and i'm just like I just want to be done for today. Though you're it's not. This is what I do so this is, you know it, this i'm here regard I would have been here until five, no matter what so, whether it be documenting or talking to a fabulous person, such as yourself so. Not not a not a big deal, I am going to just keep up with the compliance standard here the prescription recommendation i'm going to override the two day supply, I am going to get you a bridge for four days to get you over to Monday. When you go to care group on Monday, what you're going to do is you'll go to your care group and then you'll log back into the prescription vc triage department. And you can or I can give you my direct line for you to text me that you went to the group, I can confirm, and then, once I confirm that you were able to go to the group, I can get you another script out. To get you over to your next appointment okay um so what I have here is currently that's scheduled, you have you have an appointment on the fifth."
5599.0,Patient,yeah I got group on the fifth and then counselor on the Seventh and then i'm meeting with chantel on the 10th. And then yeah the care group on Monday. So I think I got yeah for next week. Okay.
386.0,Provider,"And what what i'm going to do is i'm going to bridge you for the four days today Okay, and that will get you taken care of for the 30th first, second, third. And then you'll go to care group on the on Monday and then, when you go to that care group on what will be able to do is i'll probably be able to get an additional two day supply out for you. I can't override it two times in a row, unfortunately, so i'll be able to get a two day supply out for the fourth and the fifth and then on the fifth just make sure you ask shontelle for the prescription renewal. Okay okay does that make sense, yes. Okay perfect perfect so last dose 930 in the morning when approximately when I am with no withdrawal symptoms know relapse right it pharmacy we change that today correct."
5599.0,Patient,"Correct yeah to one a little bit closer to me, I had called them and because they used to have issues like keeping it in stock and it would be. Like sometimes three days till they had it back so I had switched, but when I talked to them today, they said they have having that issues with it so."
