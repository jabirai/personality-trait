So I forgot to turn on the recording, which is a shame, because we were talking about how he missed his appointment and I asked him if he could go down to three, he said no, because if he. gets to three he'll start buying on the street suboxone he says, you won't give me some tracks, I said, but you doing okay on suboxone and let's see what else um so he got his strips and so add three minutes to what I already did with him."
