527.0,Provider,"hi this is Andrea, this is an individual session for asking appears. hey Tina how are you."
11651.0,Patient,Good how are you.
527.0,Provider,Good. How house healthy band for the last couple weeks we went a week so.
11651.0,Patient,"It was good, I I had a good time visiting my family and like. I don't know if it's because I missed them or what but like. I can, I want to move closer to them."
527.0,Provider,yeah okay okay.
11651.0,Patient,"yeah I just, I would like to be closer to them. Because I feel like i'm. Like I said I don't know if it's because, like I missed them I don't get to see them very much and then like maybe I don't know if it's because i'm on break and whatever, but I feel because I don't really have any family here it's just me. And, and I have, I have friends here. But I don't have family here and and I felt like um. I just felt more like myself being with them. and And I was. i'm going to do some writing about it today. To try to like. see if I can dig in my socks like where it like where that comes from, but. As I was driving home from. Teaching some yoga classes, this morning I was trying to like think about that, like why Why do I feel more like myself when i'm. You know. With them versus here. Okay, and. And I think because i'm here on my own that there's this. I have this underlying. sense of. there's like this underlying competitiveness within me because it's like i'm on my own, I have to make it have to get by gotta. I gotta get my can't fall behind and. And so to do that it's kind of like being survival mode, I guess, even even if it's just like hanging out friends. Okay, and i'm. Like I said, I have to write about it to figure out to get a better idea where it's coming from, but I don't know it just. I felt at home, because I was with my family. Even though early my home, you know."
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
11651.0,Patient,"And I got to meet some of their friends that i'm really glad for them, because they moved. They got they got their house like i'm. right before thanksgiving and. And I know, like my my dad's. is pretty introverted I can see, I can see where I get a lot of my treats you know. from him and. he's pretty introverted and and I. You know, moving can be hard when you get yourself established was like a social group, and especially when you're an adult and working and everything like that and but they got a dog. Over a year ago they got the dog during coven because they were my dad works from home and that mom's job is work from home now, and so they thought well forget it like now it's time to get a dog. he's he's really cute he's really smart and so. They. they've been making friends with people from the dog park they go to every weekend and sometimes it's just nice to hear them talking about like getting together with their friends every now and then and doing stuff and i'm. One of one of their friends is actually about my age and he came by one of the evenings and we all played cards against humanity together. yeah. Now I just. I missed them I miss i'm alone, I do I do want to be closer to them. But then the other part of me is like well, what do I want from my own life, you know and and a lot of that seems to be like. Closer to here, you know, at least, at least for now with like school for sure, but I did. I did look at the university near where they live to see what kind of like physics programs, they have. But I don't know but um, so there is a there is a cal State University. i'm. Not very far from where they live it's probably like maybe a 15 minute drive or so it's really close and they had they do have like. it's a cal State University, so they have they do have a physics department and they actually do have a physics, with the emphasis of astrophysics for undergrad. yeah so i'm just I wanted, I wanted to be closer to them."
527.0,Provider,What it sounds like you had a wonderful visit elsina.
11651.0,Patient,yeah.
527.0,Provider,yeah I felt like what was what was the expectations going into it.
11651.0,Patient,"I was really nervous about because, like they know i'm in outpatient for eating disorder and. I don't remember I don't remember, because you and me or rhonda and for those with rhonda or or both of you that I spoke to about it, but I had some anxiety about them seeing me like after gaining so much weight since. The last time I saw them and I didn't and I thought about like saying something to them before going down there to like. For me to eat my consciousness, hoping that they wouldn't be shocked when they see like my body different but I didn't I didn't say anything because, like. I was so busy with finals and and it just it just wasn't a priority to like. call them be like have gained a shitload of weight since. He just wasn't like and other things that were more important to me, so I didn't say anything and I. When I got off the plane, and that was my That was my expectation that they're going to see me they're going to be shocked and they're going to think like something wrong with me and. And there wasn't. Is is probably all just like. This is probably all just created my own mind. But when I got through like the security checkpoint and they saw me during face Max because we have a statewide mass mandate again and. In my mind that was like oh my God they're short they're shocked like I was like reading too much into like their body language and their facial expressions behind a mask."
527.0,Provider,Okay being like.
11651.0,Patient,"Oh God they they they can see all the weight that i've gained and oh my God and. And, and I didn't I did. They didn't say anything about it, and I was the first one to say something, and I was like I gained a bunch of weight, there were like. So, and I was I had gained like 30 pounds or like no you didn't I was like no again like 30 pounds or look well you don't look like you've gained 30 pounds and i'm."
527.0,Provider,Like.
11651.0,Patient,"Are you being honest being nicer like no like you gain weight, but like we don't it doesn't look like you get 30 pounds like you're fine like okay and and my dad and I like he he took me grocery shopping when we got back and then. We were talking and my my dad he's my dad struggled was like you know his eating and he he has he has high blood pressure and he he does he does eat a lot of like. Like he he's even brought it up to me, before like about his bingeing and stuff like that, over the years and, and so we kind of talked about that and and. And he he started telling me, like all kinds of shit that he's done with food, he was like i've used i've done this i've done this up this up this this news like you know I tried to do my best was like taking care of myself, but I he's like you don't need to worry about leap. Year okay. So just felt good being able to just be open and honest with them and not feel like. A failure of a daughter, because I gained points. and and And I noticed like I noticed this last time I was with them too, but it didn't it didn't affect me quite as much this time but it's still something that I picked I noticed for like. Because of like. The 12 sucks work that i've done. Over the years, I like using my writing on resentments and things like that, like looking at that stuff. I do notice. I do notice how they. They still hold on to not not towards me, but like with other family members, they still. harbor a lot of resentment. towards other people in my family and they like to I don't want to say they like to but they they they frequently bring up. Like something members and will start to like you know vent about them and I just kind of I don't and I don't want to like feed in so I just like okay and i'm like okay now let them talk okay. And I don't really engage into it, but it's it's just something that i've noticed and and it's like wow. i'm i'm able to pick up on this because i've done a lot of work over the years, because i've i've seen it myself and. You know, at least for them they're not engaging in self destructive behaviors like drinking and blocking out to any drugs over it. was having a little bit of grudge holding i'd said I can't do it, but um. And I noticed like. It was a little bit it was slightly triggering for my eating disorder. brain. Like my my know my step mom she's she's like a slim person she's like tall and slender and her her weights gone up and down over the years she's ever been like what's what's. often considered to be overweight, but um. So she's like on the seller side right now and it's hard for me to not notice these things because i'm really sensitive to it but. sure it hurt her eating patterns, like her frequency of eating and how she talks about. Like. i'm just going to have some cheese and crackers and hey man i'm stuff that was a big lunch i'm like. You were like three crackers. us achieve cheese."
527.0,Provider,"I call, yes I call bs."
11651.0,Patient,"yeah i'm not gonna say anything because I under because I know. I know what it's like to be in that so i'm not gonna say anything but so that was a little bit triggering for me just to be around like like that. and hear her talk like. I just i'm just never hungry until just then i'm starving and i'm hungry and all and I eat a huge meal and it's like this little tiny thing and i'm like. Okay. hey i'm sitting here like. 2530 pounds heavier i'm like. Okay. But. Again it's like it's not my place to say anything. Nor do I want to say anything, because I know and it's not my place to like sit here and say like she has some English or because I don't know what's going on in her mind, so I only know what."
527.0,Provider,i'm sure.
11651.0,Patient,"And then relating it's when i've gone through my own mind, but like even if she does have. Like a PR curve with proclivity to like diet culture stuff on a conscious or subconscious level, I know, when I was engaging and stuff like that, if anytime anybody brought up anything to me about that, like calling me out for having a disorder which was very rare, but it did happen. I don't talk to those people anymore yeah and so it's. it's just not important, you know to to engage in that kind of stuff and. So i'll just say like oh yeah whatever um I don't really like like I said I don't engage in those conversations i'll just. i'll just here like my step mom in this case i'll just. Take what she says as just a like a declarative statement she's not opening up conversation she's just saying something out loud i'm like okay. But uh."
527.0,Provider,"Did it impact, how you chose to eat, while you were there."
11651.0,Patient,"No, no, and I actually and I noticed this. too I. ate regularly I had I ate breakfast and ate lunch and dinner, and like she thinks she baked a bunch of like not a bunch she baked like two different kinds of Christmas cookies and. So I would snack on those like throughout the day to and just like if I wanted something I would get up and get it. And I had no. I had no. Food cravings I had no like cravings and I had no because I didn't have a craving and and have an urge to binge on anything. I get here. I got here yesterday, I, like my first night alone by myself, I started to want to like eat a bunch of food and start craving and i'm like wow okay. This seems to be triggered by being alone."
527.0,Provider,I was getting ready to say.
11651.0,Patient,"yeah and so like wow okay. Why, why is that, and is there, like a solution for that, because I shouldn't have to depend on having to live with other people that are close to me for me to be like balanced, you know but. it's like why, why was being alone, a trigger. And so. So that's something I. feel like I need to be looking at. um. And I wasn't just like sitting here like. with like. No other stimulus, except for food, like, I would like I watched. I watched they have cosmos Carl Sagan cosmos on YouTube for free, so I have been watching that and that like I love watching that show and. And and was texting with a friend also so it wasn't like. It wasn't like I was just sitting here and avoid you know. for whatever reason it was just like. Being by myself and. yeah."
527.0,Provider,"Well let's look at like comfort when you're by yourself, like how have you. How have you used behaviors, whatever they may be. When you're you know when you're alone to comfort yourself."
11651.0,Patient,"yeah and it's usually been something that's like. That seems in the moment right before the actual behavior like a good idea for self comforts doing but it's not like. Like not just the eating but also like prior to getting sober like my idea of self soothing is like i'm going to sit here and smoke a bowl of my face by myself i'm going to sit here and i'm going to drink a. glass of wine, but the bottles me out of one glass i'm just going to down this whole bottle of wine, because, like i'm chillin by myself. Relaxing and. that's not healthy for me and it doesn't. Like it doesn't feel good and was like the food is it's. Like like there's still is some disorder, like, I want to restrict Europe like I want to control and like not do it, but the other part, is like well. I don't need it, like my body doesn't need him sitting here and i'm trying to like you said self sooth with the sing I body doesn't really need. And so that it doesn't seem like. So, because it's something that I don't my body doesn't need it it's like it feels less like a way of being with myself in a way of like escaping for myself. and And I and i'm used to doing that, but like. I didn't have any. I didn't have any thoughts of like like self love it wasn't anything like I hate myself or don't want to be here wasn't anything like that there was no conscious like. There was no conscious thought of disliked towards myself at all, I was just like oh food by myself, I want to eat this not only this now and."
527.0,Provider,But there was the thought of I really enjoyed my family and I missed them.
11651.0,Patient,"yeah and. there's some guilt to like not. Because I did I did a little bit of writing last night. But I didn't. write everything I wanted to excited go to bed early to get up early this morning but i'm. So, like I love the people in my life like like I care about the people my life very much and I. And there is a level of love that I do feel for the people, my life but it's not the same as like with my family and so. As I was writing last night the guilt that came in and the writing I did, after eight. So that the this realization didn't come up until after I had I had overeating the back, it was like a bag of like basically trail mix like nuts and dried fruit and i'm. So, like the people that i'm living with now that i'm renting from. Like I love these people, and I feel like they're they're like my family away from home. But they're not my family and so as i'm writing about how. You know how I enjoy spending time with my parents and how I felt, you know more, like myself, and how I love them. I started feeling guilty like. On a conscious level like I see like Bob and Sharon is like family to me. But they're not, and so I don't. experience the same internal feelings. And so it's so I, so I still don't I don't feel comfortable myself and. Then I felt guilty because, like well if you feel like they're your family why can't you, you know be yourself or be your whole self. What is their day and it's like and it's like it Oh, it falls into okay wow. This is really it falls into my fear. it's it falls into my fear of using a manipulating other people to get. get my needs met and i'm like thanks. we're done now. yep and I did I did the same thing. This is something that I noticed when I got sober after rehab and like. There was a there was a person who. We don't we don't talk anymore, but we were we were friends and he. he's about he's nine years older than me. know. he's 11 years old, is about a decade or than me. And, and we got we got along really well and we used to go he he would take me to. I think it's in Berkeley oakland but in the Bay area we every Sunday morning, we would go to the the Buddhist Zen Center and they had a as it's called a zaza meditation where it's just sitting meditation and it's like. it's amazing student you sit for 45 minutes there's like 12 people in the room meditating and it's just quiet it's so quiet. And everyone's sitting there. having their own experience, and then you close off with a with chanting ritual and then after after the whole thing everyone gets together and like it's free to go to. You know, to show our gratitude for the facility, we help clean up the area so like will sweep and take trash out and things like that and rake leaves and everything, and then we do like tea and a little like. luncheon or something together. Afterwards, and talk, and so I used to do this with my friend every Sunday. And then we'd hang out outside of that too, and like we did a thanksgiving together, but he. So there's a there was a period where like my car had broken down Oh, it was because the collector my car run out, so I had a."
527.0,Provider,bit of.
11651.0,Patient,"Raj and he he let me borrow one of the cars, he was like here the cards years until you get yours back don't don't worry about it just you know put gas in it, but yeah just drive a car was like wow OK, and then after I got like my car back and. Eventually, like he he later. expressed that he had feelings towards me and I I didn't reciprocate these feelings and then after that I feel guilty, I was like. he's taking me to this place every week he wants for me healing borrows car now his feelings, for me, I can't reciprocate that. If I can see this friendship and he continues to give to me and I can't give back to him in this way i'm using him i'm using him and I can't do this, and so like I stepped away. Okay, and I didn't I didn't say those words to him, but I did kind of step back a little bit and like. We were at a friend's house. And he he didn't call me out on it, but he did say like I feel terrible and I, and I probably shouldn't have said. What I said I probably shouldn't have opened up to you on that. And I was like why he's like because we're not talking that much anymore, and like you're my friend, and I feel terrible about I should have never said that. Because our friendship means a lot to me and I felt like I just like and he was like but it's Okay, because, like I like. it's okay that you can't reciprocate these feelings towards me because I know somebody else can and i'm and i'm all and i've also met another person that it seems like there's you know. reciprocity with this friendship and I was like Okay, and then it just but, but then it felt kind of weird like well if he's getting entering a relationship, you know it just doesn't seem right. But I felt terrible because it's like i'm using this person now because he's he's given me these things he's provided me resources that I can obtain on my own and i'm using this person and I don't want to use people because I used to use people and stuff all over them and so. I thought, like out of fear. out of fear of potentially inadvertently using him as a as a resource, instead of as a human being as a friend, I was just like I can't be in this friendship, even though I had no intention of doing that it still felt, just like i'm subconsciously manipulating this person. Okay, taking advantage of their feelings towards me to get what I what I need and. And i'm afraid like that i'm that i'm doing that, with every one of my life and so. To avoid that I don't talk I push everybody away for me. Because I still don't have, and I think part of it is because, like. I still don't have much to offer to other people. I still don't have much to offer to help other people in the way that i've been helped by others because it's like a lot of it has to do with shelter, a lot of history with shelter and. or things like I financially cannot afford like shelter or like another car like, if I had these things. And I had a friend, and I would in a heartbeat be like, yes, if you need like a roof over your head until you can get on your. sleep on my couch you know you know, take the trash out once a week or like dude it's like you know just don't like the a swab but like yeah stay here. If I had another card, you know i'd be like yeah you can use my car I told it, but I don't have these things, and so I feel like I can't give back in the way there's like this imbalance, you know I feel like i'm experiencing and. And, like those kinds of resources that that people are offering me to help me. take time to to obtain and i'm working on that, but it's going to take years and I don't. I don't even know if i'm halfway there, and like. I guess I just feel guilty. and And I feel ashamed of it, and I feel small because it's like I know my 30s now and I, and I don't have a stable or secure enough life to like help other people in this way, you know."
527.0,Provider,Because you're supposed to or. where's that thinking come from.
11651.0,Patient,"I think I feel like i'm supposed to and like this isn't. And I don't think this is a. it's from what i've learned at 12 step recovery it's like. we've given you the life, you know we've given your life that you don't deserve basically so like. You need to be of service now, you need to give back you to give back you show your gratitude and giving back and giving back and so. I don't think there's anything wrong with that, by any means, but there's a level of guilt that comes with it because it's like I can't give back in the way that I. That i've been helped you know."
527.0,Provider,"Right now. Right now elsina I think let's look at like in this moment, maybe not but what am I doing to. give back i'm going to school i'm learning i'm teaching and Tutoring. You know you have different ways of giving back you're giving back yourself life, right now, most importantly, by taking care of yourself."
11651.0,Patient,"yeah and it's hard. it's hard to see it that way, because it still seems so like self focused, you know, like. i'm going to school, so I can support my life when like there's. nothing wrong with that."
527.0,Provider,But right.
11651.0,Patient,"Right go feels like. Like in 12 step recovery it's like. Are are like four top character defects are selfish self centered self seeking and dishonest. One focusing on my life i'm focusing on myself some self centered i'm trying to obtain resources for myself to be secure so that's selfish. i'm trying to establish my life so that's self seeking some focusing in on myself I don't know where there's dishonesty, in that, but like so I can tell us a recovering like Oh, those are character defects i'm being selfish and being self centered focusing on myself. that's what led me to being a drunk being self centered you know so there's God, so this is why I don't like 12 step recovery, this is why, like i'm not like."
527.0,Provider,Because what is the definition of all of those and is that your definition. Like does that equal you those definitions does do those equal you.
11651.0,Patient,"I don't know. Okay, I don't. yeah um, but I see what you're saying that that i'm that I am giving back in a different way might not look exactly the same way that people have been given to me and and I."
527.0,Provider,"You can't give back to people if you're not making yourself a priority. If you can be financially secure and stable. That will allow you to give back in the ways that you may maybe you do free yoga classes for somebody that can afford them or a discounted rate, because you have an opportunity now to offer that to somebody I don't know i'll seen it, you know it's gonna be you, you have to look at. Self listen us what's that selflessness."
11651.0,Patient,"In my brain goes to the extreme like well, I just have to be an aesthetic and completely like renounce all materialistic things and like live in an ashram and be a monk, and like give up my car give up money give up my job, give up my name. give up my identity. i'm. living in a room and be a sponsor full time. yeah so. So that's like. i'm trying to speak mindfully so I can say what I mean. Without being overly emotional. birth. A lot of that guilt I didn't have until after like getting into like a."
527.0,Provider,Okay.
11651.0,Patient,"I don't know what my life would look like, if I had never gone to a. And I think. That. It was a first it was a good first. place for me to be. To have support from people who understand what it's like to to. live in alcoholism. And not feel like a separate freak of nature from society. so that I could get sober and start to. See myself and see the world around me."
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
11651.0,Patient,"With a clear perspective. There are parts of it, though worldwide I don't. Like the guilt that i've accumulated. and The fear that's. Trying to think of the right word. The fear that's. induced from. The frequent statements from a lot of Members in meetings saying this is the last toss in the block and if you leave here if you leave a are going to drink and if you're going to drink you're going to die, so if you leave a you're going to die. And if you choose leave a is because you're selfish and self centered and self seeking like. I don't agree with any of that. But after being around that for such a long time it's been like. I started going to aim 2014 and like being around that, for as long as I have been. it's like. It almost feels kind of like a cult trying to hold you in. and But then it's like well. Nobody was forcing me to go nobody's forcing me to stay, I always had. The freedom to. come and go, as I wanted. But being naive not understanding not trusting anybody until finally starting to open up to people in the group or in the program the people that were closest to me and I trusted the most other people telling me like i'm going to die if I leave. it's like well I can't but i'm not happy here, you know i'm sober and i'm glad it's over i'm a lot happier than I was done but i'm not I still can't say that i'm happy under this seems like. The life that I want this doesn't this doesn't seem like the life that I want to live so you're telling me i'm going to die if I leave. which I know it's all bullshit. But it's almost like and we you know I know we've talked about this before, but it's but it's like Okay, so I just don't want to be around anymore. But there's a part where it's like. Okay now let you know and. This goes back to where you're you have brought up with me like finding other activities or communities outside of like recovery focused. and And I want to do that, like. I want to do that it's just as hard with the school and everything."
527.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
11651.0,Patient,"But i'm. Like I don't even know how to start doing that. I would take that takes time to start establishing like. You know, new friendships and things like that, and I still like i'm still friends with some people that i've met from like 12 step and. I have talked to them about like high feeling that none of the people that I stayed friends with. None of them have like said anything to me like oh like. For sure about this stuff right, you know. except one person who, but she doesn't. She oh she's on that I told you about who is like I would hate to see you turn your back on the 12 steps, because they look really good on you like. yeah."
527.0,Provider,Are you turning your back if you take the pieces that you need from that program and use them.
11651.0,Patient,I don't think so.
527.0,Provider,"Okay, and that's what's most important i've seen it like. What is your, how do you want that to influence how you choose to live your life."
11651.0,Patient,"it's made me a better person to be more present for people to like. Have a genuine interest in like getting to know other people. and also to become more forgiving. towards other people for just being human like. Like like the example that I used with the comments that my dad and stepmom are making about like family members and stuff like that and. And my seven was her her eating habits like. i've learned because of being in recovery groups. Like I don't need to participate in that kind of stuff and it's okay that they. Bring that up. And that's just where they are right now, maybe they'll always be there, maybe they won't but. i'm not like. it's not my place to like teach them a lesson, you know it's just where they are and I don't. I don't need to point a finger, you know and and i've learned i've learned that, and so I can. I can be. An understanding compassionate under intolerant person. With with anybody in my life, no matter where I meet them from. and"
527.0,Provider,Which is your service.
11651.0,Patient,"see it like knowing like knowing that doesn't. Get rid of the feelings of guilt or shame or fear of like. Are they right, am I going to die, you know. Like there's part of me it's like. an incredibly i'm incredibly grateful. For 12 step because. Again I don't know where i'd be if I hadn't. started before you know. But then, on the other side it's like I wish I had never exposed myself to it and."
527.0,Provider,So both things are true. Okay. Can you accept that both things are true.
11651.0,Patient,yeah. yeah.
527.0,Provider,"So how do I, how do I move with knowing that that's true, how do I move through that guilt and shame. Why is that there."
11651.0,Patient,"I wish I could say that there's like. I wish that there was like. A quick formula or solution or fix or switch. And I don't think there exists any of that and I think the only thing is just time. to let it to let those emotions be what they are. As they are for the duration that they need to be and I can't. I think it's better than i'm aware of them. Okay, accepting of their presence. Instead of trying to ignore them and save them down, but I also don't want to be. I think right and I, and I think i'm doing that right now i've just not made it like conscious like this because I haven't put it in words but. I just don't want to be driven by those emotions are dominated by the emotions. I don't want to be."
527.0,Provider,Can you feel them and let them go. and release them.
11651.0,Patient,They come back.
527.0,Provider,"Okay, so feel them and let them go."
11651.0,Patient,How do I do that. How do I do that.
527.0,Provider,How do you love feelings go in your body.
11651.0,Patient,ate food. And then I feel bad.
527.0,Provider,"Okay. Oh, not that cycle. Not that cycle king. What does letting go of guilt feel like in your body. Where do you hold it where do you keep it and how do you release it."
11651.0,Patient,"I feel guilt. Like around my heart mm hmm okay. I feel around my heart and. my throat, and my shoulders my head. And i've not. willfully let it go like okay guilt you're gone now and it's like it i've not been able to ever do that it's just taken. Time and time like. Continuing to live my life, based on my own conscious actions of what I want to be doing. And just. Like. Like my. guilt that i've held from like my last romantic relationship. it's mostly gone now um it's it's mostly gone now but it's it's taken almost the entire duration, that the relationship was for to start to get that light and and it's just really been like. Processing it by you know. Talking about it with others. writing about it. Even talking to the person occasionally just to kind of see like the reality of where things are right now and and instead of like believing my fantasy ideas. and staying on my own path that does not focus on the relationship where the guilt came from and it's. Those actions and then just time. Staying committed to myself. And it feels lighter you know. A lot lighter it feels. Like. Like. Wait there's less English and just being a person."
527.0,Provider,"Okay, yes. i'm gonna send you something okay. Because. it's just what you are describing. want you to. Practice this. is called radical acceptance. Have you heard of it."
11651.0,Patient,mm hmm.
527.0,Provider,"So I want you to think about that with some some situations, specifically the ones you just described and walk through that be able to walk through that process for yourself. Because I think it's going to allow you to recognize like. How it's hindering you. And what would help you to. find some resolution. In time is. is true, like, I think, time does help in that process. But also, am I holding on to it more than I need to. Like Am I prolonging the pain. More than 92."
11651.0,Patient,"yeah I can see. How that could be entirely true also. Because it's a long time, like like."
527.0,Provider,The example of the relationship with.
11651.0,Patient,"We weren't even married you know it's like. that's a long time. and It could be like you know holding on to the guilt or holding on to that grief or the remorse or whatever. coincides with like the ending of relationship or that the ending of something in one's life. Is. comparable to like my self harming behaviors you know I am. Like it's another form of like. Self abuse on a conscious level like keeping my. my mind in a perpetual state of. Depression because I keep going back to these thoughts and these feelings and. Re and ruminating on them and then through rumination like reigniting them as if it just happened yesterday, or something like that. And and euro the time, like the time seems to have been like. The most effective thing, but like it takes time. and I heard of radical acceptance I don't I haven't like really put into practice, obviously, but i'd heard of it and from. Tara Brock I listen to her podcast some times, she is. she's a modern day Buddhist and. that's how i'd heard of it and. When I. When I do practice like. More regular mindfulness and meditation. I haven't done it with emotions, I like when I meditate i've usually just like do kind of like spatial awareness meditation. I haven't really focused more like inward. But when I do that there's there's a sense of like. Non self there and through non self there's no attachment to these feelings or that or even a story because it's non self so there's there is a story, but i'm not involved in it and. And it's easier to see things to will not six months looking in but it's it's. Stepping outside of it. And like. Also, think about it. It doesn't keep me a moon from from being an emotion, sometimes, but like I think about like in terms of. Just like the nature of human beings and like. Our our biology of behavior and things like that. Like it's like oh. it's only special to me because it's me, but in the Grand scheme of things and i'll humanities like i'm not the only like this, this is what humans do so it's like. You ruminating because that's what you do. But when I think about it. From the outside i'm not like in it, but when I step back into myself a minute and. yeah i'll look into the. Radical acceptance."
527.0,Provider,"All right, we're gonna work on practicing some of that see how you do. Good work today wow i'll see now you did some soul searching. Thank you i'm glad you had such a wonderful time with your family, though."
