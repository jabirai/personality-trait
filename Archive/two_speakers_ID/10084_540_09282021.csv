540.0,Provider,"Everyone got through it Okay, though."
10084.0,Patient,yeah We made it okay.
540.0,Provider,"Okay, good all right okay so what's going on with your mom."
10084.0,Patient,same shit different fucking day excuse my language.
540.0,Provider,So.
10084.0,Patient,"She might be dad went to Oregon. Friday or Thursday, Friday came back Sunday he left Thursday night so she needed me. So she was really nice, you know, so I opener and then as soon as he came off. Yesterday afternoon raving did she get it i'm like. wow so packed up my ship left you to yeah i'm gonna go home now."
540.0,Provider,But you guys were able to have some time while she was nice.
10084.0,Patient,"So weird gassy because. When i'm there, I mean she's telling me how miserable she is in the marriage. You know my dad's not. You know, he doesn't kiss her hugger he's not whatever that word is i'm thinking of."
540.0,Provider,A faction that.
10084.0,Patient,"Actually, thank you know he's the other bedroom now because my mom has the. restless restless leg syndrome from the chemo."
540.0,Provider,mm hmm.
10084.0,Patient,"So she keeps them while she sleeps, and that makes him mad. And she's telling me that she's ready to move out she's gonna go to assisted living and. Okay, well, I feel sorry for. Then I can also look at it from my dad's point of view he's probably tired of her being a bitch all the time. well. yeah I mean, and she says, you know of course he's grumpy diane he does everything for me, he has to the shopping the cooking the laundry. You know, of course, he's grumpy and i'm like yeah but you know you still show some affection, you know that's your life companion, you know. I don't know so I felt for her when we were talking for those two three days about it, you know."
540.0,Provider,So you guys had two three days for you were able to have like some okay.
10084.0,Patient,"Great yeah Okay, so what is. What is it my little brain shrink or help me understand this."
540.0,Provider,"So I mean it's hard because it's a hard circumstance for anybody to be in, especially when it comes to your dad he has to take care of everything i'm sure that though he tries to get away from the negative talk from your mom i'm sure that it happens. So the affection can sometimes it also can sometimes go away if your dad starting to disconnect because he fears obviously that death is going to happen. yeah they start to disconnect. Because. In a way, it's a sense of control where you're able to any and it's you're not able to feel that affection, because you're already starting to cope with the loss."
10084.0,Patient,"I see yeah yeah you know when my brother died and. My dad was talking to my mom and I, because we were very upset. And I looked at my dad and i'm like well how come you're not upset and how come you're not crying you're always in control, you know he's got to be the strong one in control of everything. Any well there's two different kinds of people diane there's people like me I come up on a situation and I see a bunch of sorrow and sadness and everybody crying and I back away from that. Because I don't want to do that i'm like well how did you learn that he said well my dad died when I was 13. And my Nana said you go up there, Robert and you say goodbye to your father don't you cry you hold it together and you'd be strong. And he said and that's what I remember when it comes to sorrow is I don't have to be crying and weeping I can still feel it inside but I don't have to show it on the outside. wow. that's I don't know i'd like to cry."
540.0,Provider,"I do think that there's certain people and families that have to hold it together for the others, like, for my siblings that was that was me and my mom's here know where I was the one hold it together get everybody mind their p's and q's make sure everyone's good. And then. kind of help everybody, through it, so I think that it's needed. and family for there has to be that one person that you can look at and it's sue's you."
10084.0,Patient,If that makes sense.
540.0,Provider,It just kind of like suit the room.
10084.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
540.0,Provider,"Man it's it's hard, a lot of us, especially when it comes to cancer there's no right way to cope family members and that's why a lot of tension can arise there can be just because everyone cope so different it's a I mean it's a different type of loss than just like an immediate loss. Where it's just."
10084.0,Patient,that's done has been lying. it's just lingering you. Use your mom passed from cancer to right.
540.0,Provider,"yeah yeah. So there's definitely that lingering but but with your dad and your mom that that sense of comfort that she's also wanting that affection. He may not be capable of it, right now, too, because so if his mom so he's already grieving so he's already he has to put that face on like his mom taught or wasn't his mama taught him that."
10084.0,Patient,yeah yeah. My dad oh yeah.
540.0,Provider,"So he's already. He may be already putting on that show for himself to get through as well, and for everybody else, so instead of it just being an abrupt and then it being the funeral services and everything like that he has to be like that, and definitely right now until. things happen."
10084.0,Patient,"yeah cuz even at my lana his mom's funeral. I never saw him shed a tear. He kept it together, you know total good composure. And like three months afterwards they have like a game room my mom and dad do where there's a pool table and all that, and he had some enormous stuff in there and now he used to keep a coffee can out on the back porch with their cigarette butts in there. And he kept that. Like POPs What do you do, and he said what What do you mean I said well why are you keeping this oh I don't know because it was my mom's. there's that sensitive, you know it's in there."
540.0,Provider,And then there.
10084.0,Patient,"yeah you just doesn't do it. yeah. And I could be that way when you know tragedy happens in other people's life. mm hmm like my coworker 16 years or fiance got killed in a in a car wreck just boom and I felt now that I look back, I see myself as my dad in that situation. You know I held it all together from my friend. You know."
540.0,Provider,"And that and that position it's. it's so important. Early there has to be that one structured stable person and and sometimes it's nice to be on the outside, to be that person. For like a friend."
10084.0,Patient,And yeah.
540.0,Provider,get them through it. But it's yeah it's hard with family because I mean everyone's a part of it so yeah.
10084.0,Patient,"we're friends, a whole different ballgame when it's family."
540.0,Provider,it's a whole different ballgame.
10084.0,Patient,"crazy. So, on my niece's my nephew and the baby's mom had to quarantine here too."
540.0,Provider,Oh really oh yeah I think you said that oh man so busy house.
10084.0,Patient,"Was it was horrible. Because the mom doesn't watch her. So i'm in bed i'm sick in the babies and the baby only one to be with me. mom and i'm like okay Come on, so she's feeling better and i'm feeling shitty or right, so I nephew and her mom I said you guys kind of watch her I gotta sleep. And i'm laying in a bed, and I can't sleep, because I know she's running around I can hear her feet. Running all over the living room and also your total silence done like oh. So I get up I go into the kitchen and she had one of those 18 pack of eggs. Oh, you like the kitchen floor. yeah and then I just lost my crap. You know I just blew up you guys you guys should be watching her i'm sick you guys are fine come on help a little bit, but."
540.0,Provider,What were they doing.
10084.0,Patient,"Playing video games. Oh, goodness yeah yeah. yeah. But so now they're back together again okay."
540.0,Provider,And how happen.
10084.0,Patient,"I guess they're doing Okay, but before they left here because they were here for two and a half weeks. quarantining and they were broken up before all this happened, and so I sat them both down and. that's it I don't know what you guys are planning it's really none of my business but it's my business when it comes to my Nice. You guys want to make this work, why don't you guys still stay separated, you know shauntel you you live with your sister and Nick you stay at home. And why you guys try dating and and going at it slow, because you guys boom moved in together you guys have been broken up, and now you're gonna move in together again and just. take some time apart yeah like okay Okay, and then my nephew lied to me for about two weeks saying, she wasn't she was and wow it just scares me for my Nice, you know."
540.0,Provider,And how much do you have your nice still do you have her.
10084.0,Patient,Well it's gone down to about 75% of the time now.
540.0,Provider,Okay. But so majority.
10084.0,Patient,"yeah like she's in my bed right now sleeping okay yeah, which is good, you know cassie it's so hard, because she went camping with them over the weekend so she was gone for me for three days it was back she's a total mess. Just a hot mess she doesn't listen she doesn't mind. she's just a little just a raging little bitch when she comes back they don't have any boundaries or any rules or anything."
540.0,Provider,"And I mean that's difficult to so it's like have her more. And then you got to be able to have that consistency, where it's not just her coming back as like a terror with the boundaries."
10084.0,Patient,yeah.
540.0,Provider,But then it's also outweighing it's.
10084.0,Patient,"yeah but then moms like trying to be the mom of the year, you know she say why why spend more time with her i'm like okay. Well, what do you do with your today you read a book with her or you take her to the park, you know spend some trying to teach her how to get that bond going yeah she's just on her phone 24 seven the moment."
540.0,Provider,"I think that's a hard thing that I think it's like my generation, where people don't understand that there's so much more to being a mom or a parent. My dad than just the title. yeah so actually doing the parenting where you have to do the good the bad the ugly that in different, you have to have those boundaries, especially at this point of their life, where you're setting their life up. To be able. to live and to know what to do and have the moral support but. But it's also technology so there's so many, but I feel like it's my generation that has steered away from parenting and it's been like. Pretty pictures on social media and. And that star mom yeah."
10084.0,Patient,"And like I told her, because now, when much comes back. They I have a tablet for but she can only use it for maybe 30 minutes, it has to be a learning thing that she's playing with on a computer on the low tablet. which he also has one with them and our older sister who's eight she has a cell phone. mom just gives her the cell phone gives the baby the tablet let's sit on it all day long. When she comes here, and she wants to and i'm like no we have rules, you only do 30 Minutes that we have to go outside and she just throws a fit yeah. You know so here I am being the bad guy you know."
540.0,Provider,Have you told them the roles that you have that they. should be okay.
10084.0,Patient,"yeah but my mom says well you know what anti if I wanted to my instagram account is so big that I could start making money from it. And she has a friends only APP or something. That is, I don't know what that is friend yeah it's like you could actually people will pay you to do things. Whether it's your makeup. show your boobs. know that."
540.0,Provider,yeah. I think I would.
10084.0,Patient,Have you heard about it.
540.0,Provider,"I think i've heard, I think they have a few of those different Apps i've. been learning. yeah I think that i've been hearing more about it in groups, people will talk about it and was the other one, but I think that I have heard about it. But."
10084.0,Patient,yeah yeah Steve.
540.0,Provider,"yeah I know that there's like a lot of Apps that are out there, for what is that called like fetishes."
10084.0,Patient,And I.
540.0,Provider,"kind of like that, but that, but it may be a different one following the same."
10084.0,Patient,"Well, I was watching tick tock a couple weeks ago and there were people on there all the time that. People actually send them gifts and money and stuff. is like so there's well in the world that think they have this nice connected relationship with this person is posting things and that's like wow how sick is this world. it's crazy, but she told me, she was going to get an instagram account for much enter sister. And i'm not she's not even three years old yeah dude. And the eight year old you can't do that there's perverts out there. I know you what i'm powerless there's nothing I could do. You know."
540.0,Provider,"it's very difficult, especially especially social media and how everyone invest so much time, energy and just their life on social media. I mean you'll see it when people. You think that we would have learned from coven and just taking in who's around you and actually being present and. But now I mean you'll see people going to the restaurant and they're they're on their phones again and."
10084.0,Patient,yeah.
540.0,Provider,"And like not a year ago we weren't even allowed to restaurants, so I mean why didn't we learn we didn't."
10084.0,Patient,"Know like when my mom was here, I made her an eye tacos we're sitting in the kitchen and I said Okay, this is, this is our time and then she picks up her phone and i'm like What do you do take a picture of the food. And i'm like no so I grabbed her phone I put on the other side of the table. And she was actually like going through withdrawals she was like, can I just have my phone just for a minute I just watched it and i'm like No, this is our time together."
540.0,Provider,Now.
10084.0,Patient,"you're going to concentrate on what I say i'm going to concentrate on what you say we're going to visit we're going to communicate without technology without we don't you're not take a video of what you're eating nobody out there you're eating, you know."
540.0,Provider,"yeah, and I mean I i've always been I mean i'm a grandma like I like traditional ways I don't like being on the phone I like dinner I don't like any of that. But like I found it to if I go on vacations if I I got like an actual like. camera so that i'm not on my phone or anything if I need pictures i'll take a picture, but I don't have to look at them like and then I can maybe weeks later download them onto my computer and then look at them eventually."
10084.0,Patient,Where have you been all my life.
540.0,Provider,"nobody's like that anymore, though, you see people on their. phone and then they're editing the pictures, while they're on vacation i'm like enjoy your vacation."
10084.0,Patient,Put the phone down look at. Look at your family gosh crazy.
540.0,Provider,"it's just. We have too much that's except i'm accessible to us, I it's just."
10084.0,Patient,yeah.
540.0,Provider,And I don't I don't think we were ready for all of it and it just consumes technology consumes us.
10084.0,Patient,"Oh yeah. I mean. Work when. Facebook not really my space, but Facebook and instagram I have to admit I would sit up for hours and do it. yeah there's either a look and look and look and after a while i'm like well look at the laundry pile up God damn I kitchens dirty you know because i've been doing. So yeah and then all the drama that goes with it."
540.0,Provider,especially nowadays everything's political.
10084.0,Patient,Out there and.
540.0,Provider,it's just social medias it's it's too much and social media it's privately owned so it's already filtered information you're not getting a whole picture of things.
10084.0,Patient,I mean they don't want to believe that.
540.0,Provider,"I know I know so it's. it's insane it's insane that people don't understand that what we're getting most of it is filtered so you talk about the news you talk about social media really the only act accurate information, you can get is on like web pages that show both sides like reddit."
10084.0,Patient,or yeah.
540.0,Provider,read it yeah. yeah. Twitter used to be something that was unfiltered but they've started filtering things now.
10084.0,Patient,"Oh, do they really."
540.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
10084.0,Patient,"it's um it scares me for for their future like my mom and I were talking about, because they have a lot of money for my dad and. My mom is always hung that over my head like a carrot yeah well you're not gonna get any of this $4 million unless you do this or you do this and. Finally, I told her you know I don't want any money I don't care I don't want any of it yeah but she always against that tried to do that with my nephews and they don't care they don't listen to her, but we had a. pretty good talk about, because now, you know, since we had that three good days now she wants to be in the world. And what to do with my niece is with the money. And she asked me what I would do and i'm like well I would do whatever you want me to do you know but. You know. I told my mom if you did lay down these guidelines of what they have to meet in life before they can have 10,000. You know i'm going to have to follow that right."
540.0,Provider,"So so yeah and so, if you're the executor and she has something in the well, you have to follow what she says. yeah but, but if she says i'm leaning up to diane kinsley to decide what to do with my money then it's up to you, so, then, but if she were to say that leave sounds whoa to this person give this person these rings give this person and I don't know. A dresser. Then you have to follow."
10084.0,Patient,"yeah because, for once, over the last three days when we were together. She wasn't doing the carrot thing. You know, we actually had a conversation about about her belongings and. I was telling her that I might think about selling my house. And then stay in my mom and dad's House you know and by whoever out, you know, whatever they weren't my house is huge it's too big for me. and That we actually had we had like it used to be, you know we used to be close when she first got diagnosed with cancer. You know, we talked about a lot of things and we communicated well, and so we had a little touch of that but it's so easy for her just to it's gone and she's back to a bitch and then I cry all the way home."
540.0,Provider,And and that's The thing is the waves it's going to be like this. So trying to. If you can start sensing like one she's going to like start flipping the switch.
10084.0,Patient,yeah.
540.0,Provider,"Then, making sure you spit out Oh, but it's gonna happen so now going into it, knowing that. But sometimes even just saying it to yourself to try not to take it personal because it does happen to I mean I worked in so it's not just my mom like I worked in a nursing home for a long time and you'd see that, where. Family would come in and then sometimes it would end with people just running and crying. yeah so then each time it had to be sometimes people will just be like Okay, like, I can tell like tone of voice when my mom is getting that way, and then i'm going to skip battle and. We would help out in that process so sometimes I mean if your mom was looking into Assisted Living that could potentially help you in the process to."
10084.0,Patient,"yeah yeah definitely. yeah now you'd be proud, when the phone so she started being a real bitch like a week and a half, I just didn't feel good I was so sick and that's my thing you know what mom i'm not going to do this, I gotta go and say don't you hang up on me again. starts that like you said you know i'm just like I can't do this mom I gotta go i'll talk to you later and I hang up on her. Okay, done that probably 20 times now."
540.0,Provider,And you'll probably do it's one or more times.
10084.0,Patient,"And our you know, but thank you cuz Thank you, thank you, I had been able to do that. And when I get off the phone I don't cry anymore. it's just like you know what she was in control of that she messed up I don't have to go into that that space where she was yeah well and that feels good Now I know I feel like a. like an adult."
540.0,Provider,"yeah i'm glad that and it's also it'll allow you to have these moments with her too, so instead of just cutting it out completely you're able to still have moments."
10084.0,Patient,"Right right. yeah because after I hang up on her I don't call her the next day. I wait for her to call me and then that is called me she's a lot nicer. and loving and you know she says, I wish we could communicate better, and then we try to talk through it and sometimes we can sometimes we can't but it's a whole different ballgame cassie."
540.0,Provider,Oh good.
10084.0,Patient,Teaching me that. Always is.
540.0,Provider,Any little gems i'll try to think of them.
10084.0,Patient,"Right it's just you know even my dad my dad said I went over there, and he says so, you know what I was worried with you hanging up on mom all the time. But because he gets here the brunt of it right. Five times did it, she was ranting and raving he said I just went into got a beer, he says, but now she's like God damn it she puts the phone down it she doesn't say anything she does she does away rave she just sits there and thinks about it. Okay, so that's good thing I said oh good. yeah yeah. it'll help all the way around."
540.0,Provider,It well.
10084.0,Patient,yeah.
540.0,Provider,And there's going to be moments where you're not going to be able to get through the barrier but. yeah yeah.
10084.0,Patient,"I do it's funny as she used to call me back when I would hang up on her long, long time ago. She. called me back."
540.0,Provider,And she probably now knows the boundaries so she now knows that you need that space everything needs to cool down and then restart whenever you guys talk next.
10084.0,Patient,it's weird it's kind of like parenting.
540.0,Provider,yeah.
10084.0,Patient,Like I barigye my parents.
540.0,Provider,"In a sense, I think it comes full full circle, I think that if you think of it as a full circle where I mean you start off and diapers you start off having to be kind of told and talk to, in a certain manner. and have like a regimen and have the specific guidelines what you need to do. If you think about it. At the end of life, you still need that too, so you get back to. All of those things that some kind of like Benjamin button style. Know oh it's a good movie. yeah long but good yeah."
10084.0,Patient,"yeah yeah just when my mom had her. Her surgery or cancer surgery. And I stayed in the hospital with her. Every day, every night, it was like eight or 10 days, because she lost control of her bowels. and has had so many patients, you know they could come right in and change her. Well i've told the nurses, give me the stuff i'll do it, and I remember the first time I was doing my mom was crying she's like you shouldn't have to do this, you should go get a nurse i'm like no they're too busy and i'm like mom you change my diapers now i've cheated years. You know, but it is like coming full circle."
540.0,Provider,"Oh man, I remember my mom she was so so stubborn. So separate I don't even think it was like it was till like the like last maybe two weeks, where she started becoming continent, but she man like regardless of like how like bad she's like she was, I mean she would walk herself. Really her yeah she was so stubborn with that she's like i'm not gonna put my pants. Okay mom she's like no i'm not i'm not going to do that."
10084.0,Patient,well.
540.0,Provider,"Good for her though gosh so stubborn that was her stubbornness that's, the only thing then yeah."
10084.0,Patient,yeah did you end up having to change her and help her.
540.0,Provider,yeah yeah at the end of it on the last.
10084.0,Patient,"Well, if I lost you. I lost you. I can't hear you well. know."
540.0,Provider,"So, like the last month, so she had that to climb that they say and then she had that few days, where she was doing, like everything like she was like up and talking and like lively. yeah so she had all of that, and then all of a sudden, for two weeks she was just in bed she had like that rattling."
