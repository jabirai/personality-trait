416.0,Provider,Just like. That happens. yeah So how have you been managing without your suboxone because you've kind of be out by now.
9097.0,Patient,yeah good today today's my birthday out not good. yeah.
416.0,Provider,"So, are you. I mean, what are you going to do, how are you managing."
9097.0,Patient,hoping to get this meeting done good big okay for me to get built.
416.0,Provider,"Okay um well you gotta go to the. you've got to go to the clinic the rx clinic let me see I don't know if they're still open, I don't know that they are. So you gotta. I would call in the morning because they're open at like 4am Pacific time so what's that like 7am your time. If you call them in the morning and let them know you need a bridge until Thursday."
9097.0,Patient,And they wouldn't do it because I had to get my meeting with you for so you know.
416.0,Provider,"Okay, they told you okay. I said, make the meeting huh."
9097.0,Patient,So.
416.0,Provider,"Okay. So um. How can we just trying to think because. One of them was a work thing, and the other one could you I mean, is there a way for you to let us know and like cancelled the group so that you're not. showing up as a no show. Let me see if they're showing up as cancelled or no show."
9097.0,Patient,"Like the one with my phone and stuff when I got ran over you know, obviously I didn't, then you know."
416.0,Provider,How do you get run over.
9097.0,Patient,"is in my lunch box and new I you know was getting ready to go and Guy that was driving the truck is back in the truck up you know, to go ahead and you know pick me up he didn't realize my lunch box back there, so we got everything going, I mean phone. Everything."
416.0,Provider,"Okay, so all right Okay, so I see that there was."
9097.0,Patient,You have so you've missed the last four.
416.0,Provider,Groups one was canceled on the ninth than the 16th was a no show the 23rd was a no show the 30th you cancels. Okay.
9097.0,Patient,"My phone was the only one, I didn't write. You know, but."
416.0,Provider,You have to.
9097.0,Patient,"Usually my wife she's what does it mean you know she's pretty good about it, for me, you know."
416.0,Provider,"All right, well. And so. yeah tell me tell me how everything else has been going it sounds like you've been. Working a lot are. They working long hours."
9097.0,Patient,yeah pretty much.
416.0,Provider,Like what are your normal hours market.
9097.0,Patient,We don't have. Like a normal day I guess we'll be friendly. You know. Maybe 230 you know. You know. I can work into five.
416.0,Provider,Oh that's pretty normal I was under the impression you're working from like six in the morning until late at night or something.
9097.0,Patient,"No, no, no, no, like that you know. I mean just ever now, it will have you know something goes so. far you know. But you know. For most part, you know but it's where we're at so we're in the. we're like. On the. backs of like where we're at you know. And we have no cell phone service Inshallah again so you know that's what gets me I like our 45 minutes. I say yeah."
416.0,Provider,"So that's. yeah that makes sense. I mean, would it be easier for you to like just go to a suboxone clinic. He wouldn't have to deal with therapy appointments and. Groups and stuff. you're you're. Pretty stable, for the most part right like."
9097.0,Patient,"yeah me it would be a really good I mean. it's just that. it's just my insurance that's what gets me there's only like two of them in the town, how they live. And anyway, they don't take my insurance. say I was going through you know I spend cash and everything. that's whenever they dropped me and said, you know, I was considered like insurance fraud or some shit."
416.0,Provider,"Okay. So, are there any better like even an hour away you."
9097.0,Patient,"could go to with your insurance, I mean. what's every you know it's just a lot easier to do this and. I mean. I mean it's just so hard. I mean it's ridiculous there you know."
416.0,Provider,"Okay, I mean i'm not trying to get rid of you i'm just trying to think."
9097.0,Patient,About what's the easiest.
416.0,Provider,"way to think about what's the easiest for you, because, like if you could go somewhere. when somebody is brand new in recovery I want them with us are on an Inpatient or you know intensive outpatient or something like that, but when somebody has been stable, for a long time on suboxone. And it seems like you know just going in once a month to get your suboxone refilled or whatever."
9097.0,Patient,If you can do that makes sense because you don't sort of need that intensity of.
416.0,Provider,"You know the groups, all the time and everything."
9097.0,Patient,"Exactly I mean I would I would rather do that you know it's just the problem lies, you know, then I don't know it's completely different here in Tennessee and what is it is everywhere else I guess. pharmacies man. it's about you know, for one, you know. So I get you here by insurance, you know. It is, I mean it just."
416.0,Provider,All the time yeah. it's like it's. A mess out there for you guys.
9097.0,Patient,"I mean, it really is, you know, because they have the. Especially walters you know they have they make their pharmacy people God, you know that can be non prescription and stuff so. yeah really it's mostly what's around you know. have a lot of. Other choices, you know I guess what you know you probably California, you know people."
416.0,Provider,"Well, if you wanted to check with your insurance to see if there was anything, even within like an hour drive because that you can do like once a month, we can help you and give you like a list of things through your insurance that. might work."
9097.0,Patient,But.
416.0,Provider,"But if you want to keep up with us like i'm i'm all for it, I just trying to figure out how to make your life as easy as possible, since you are pretty serious."
9097.0,Patient,I would rather stay on that you know I mean it's. You know there's there's probably like the easiest you know. You know. Learn everything like that you know.
416.0,Provider,"And then, in the wintertime to things slow down for you, I would guess."
9097.0,Patient,yeah you can't run chainsaws dark you know.
416.0,Provider,yeah. So what do you do in the wintertime to keep busy.
9097.0,Patient,"I still work there, you know. Just."
416.0,Provider,Not different hours okay.
9097.0,Patient,yeah you know just nobody's the Marion I guess you know.
416.0,Provider,"So um okay. So, are you going to be able to make it to group, this week, are we, no, no, you don't. Let me see what group you're in. Because we change things around. You might not even know this because we've."
9097.0,Patient,"known about it, oh."
416.0,Provider,"So you're in the 130 group. But not this. This week we don't have the 130 group, it was last week so we're doing every other week. 130 or sorry it's 430 for you every other. and But that's a problem for your. Even more. sense if we want to have group."
9097.0,Patient,"yeah I mean. What they told me, you know, in the. You know that you use one have made blocked on that you know. A few you know."
416.0,Provider,me I was going to be blocked.
9097.0,Patient,I mean that it's.
416.0,Provider,Because you it's because you haven't shown up.
9097.0,Patient,"yeah me I thought that was funny anyway, because you know, last time we talked you know, once a month, you know. September one you know."
416.0,Provider,Let me send a message to mark who's your care navigator and Tracy really fast i'm going to send them a little message really quick. You have.
9097.0,Patient,To do for me there. Much better.
416.0,Provider,"So Marcus i'm i'm. sending a message to. mark and Tracy. And I just. wrote, yes, you missed the last four groups to were cancellations to were no shows when you lost your phone run over. And the other one you had to work. you're out of suboxone today's your first day without it. you're going to call in to the. The prescription line for a. bridge, but since you're still assigned to the fourth 30 group on Thursdays that's now every other week and it doesn't meet. This week, it will be a long bridge so i'm just asking them what ideas they have. To senior what we can. do about this, but. When you call into the prescription line, let them know that. That you're. Reading this week. Let them know that your group isn't happening this week."
9097.0,Patient,Okay next right.
416.0,Provider,"Next Thursday so. So that you'll need a longer bridge oh might have to get. approval from Tracy. for that. And then unless Tracey wants to move your group, if you and there's a 1030 group that we run that I know she moved a lot of people into and the 1030 groups so what's that 130 your time but you'll be working then right."
9097.0,Patient,"yeah that'd be. very, very hoping we'd make that."
416.0,Provider,"Okay, so then that's The only other option okay. So let me, let me, let me see what happens with Tracy but calling the bridge line in the morning. i'll let them know that you made it to this. Group and everything or to this meeting."
9097.0,Patient,"meeting tomorrow, do you know what that is."
