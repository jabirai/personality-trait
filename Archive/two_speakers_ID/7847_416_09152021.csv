7847.0,Patient,I am uh yeah i'm outside on the patio thanks.
416.0,Provider,How are you doing.
7847.0,Patient,Seven minute i'm doing good yeah has been a long while. i'm doing good working a lot keeping busy kind of stuff so.
416.0,Provider,Lots of Tutoring.
7847.0,Patient,And so much Tutoring substituting. i'm still not a tutor oh.
416.0,Provider,Okay. So you're substituting a lot huh.
7847.0,Patient,"yep five days a week or No four days a week, I keep friday's off for me and David."
416.0,Provider,"wow. So, I imagine, maybe some of the stress that you were feeling around you know not having steady work and money is is that hostess alleviated that a little bit."
7847.0,Patient,"i'm a little bit I still haven't gotten paid for my first month I get paid like at the end of this month, so there's still a lot of stress related to that. But I at least know that good money is coming because i've been working pretty hard so. Good good."
416.0,Provider,yeah. Even last time we talked you mentioned to some some of the challenges with your girlfriends who had gotten pregnant.
7847.0,Patient,yeah.
416.0,Provider,Is that still going on.
7847.0,Patient,"um yes and no they decided not to do polyamory anymore, because of their relationship, I guess, their marriage was on the rock so I decided that everyone else has to go that included me so. i've still been like seeing her occasionally or rarely I guess i'd say, like me and David was with her and some of her friends to a dinner, like last couple weeks ago. But the that it's pretty over."
416.0,Provider,i'm sorry. How are you feeling about.
7847.0,Patient,um I was really sad when it started like I got really depressed for at least a couple of days. But I talked it out with Jerry and David and I got a feeling better and. started looking for dates again. So i'm i'm pretty much over it. let's dress up but i'm over it.
416.0,Provider,Have you been dating somebody else.
7847.0,Patient,"No, not actively i've been trying like i've been. On okay keep it a lot trying to get a date but I haven't gotten any one yet."
416.0,Provider,Have you met her too.
7847.0,Patient,yeah I met her on OK cupid.
416.0,Provider,"isn't there, like a poly specific dating site."
7847.0,Patient,"There is, but it's not populated very well. So a lot of people in poly groups will talk about it but it's just there's nobody on it so there's no use in using it. yeah okay keep it as good because they do allow you the option of putting that your non monogamous which the other ones don't so. yeah okay keep it has been the best go for polyamorous people."
416.0,Provider,"And so, other than I should find all of that how have your moods and have you been feeling pretty steady or a noun or."
7847.0,Patient,"i'm a little up and down i've had some moments, where I feel are really a. Very impulsive and all the other things, and like my sex drive through the roof. and other times i'll feel a little down but it's been like a couple of days of each here and there, for the most part, I felt pretty normal or mid line, I guess, I should say."
416.0,Provider,Okay. And are you shouldn't tell still monitoring your left hand levels pretty closely. Okay. So what's on your mind to talk about today.
7847.0,Patient,um let's see I started or restarted dating a ex boyfriend. he's from the beginning of my polyamorous journey so he's the first person that I actually dated.
416.0,Provider,Oh wow.
7847.0,Patient,"So that was like seven years ago and we've been off and on like since then. Three years ago, was our last breakup and that was my doing. So we we met up and we got a couple of drinks and then before I knew it we were kissing and that was that so and then I met his Burt his live in girlfriend. So she's really cool. let's see Oh, I have this same. thing David gets on me about. Since I haven't got a paycheck yet I haven't been able to pay so my bills and David has been asking me if I could pay my bills and I would say no, and need like. I don't know how you would put it, but he would he would say to me like you know you have to ask for help if you if you get to that point and i'm like no no i'll just wait until I get paid and unpaid, that means I will know, the late fees, and all this kind of stuff and. Like I don't know like I was thinking about it, like sitting here thinking about it before I got on the call with you and i'm like I was with my husband like I had no problem, asking for money when I needed it. But I guess our relationship was a different dynamic because, from the beginning, we shared an apartment and we shared all of the expenses and we split everything together, whereas here it's like David takes pretty much everything and I don't split any of it, I just take care of my bills. So, asking him for help just I don't know it doesn't feel good. And I hate doing it, but he insists that I should cast him when I need help. I don't know what's up with that."
416.0,Provider,"way. So it sounds like like the difference is that your dynamic with David is just really different, and it has been from the beginning, but it also sounds to me like David maybe wants to change that dynamic or is open to changing. Or you know."
7847.0,Patient,"I I i'm willing to it's just. I don't know like I have so much of my. Independence like taken from like after the divorce like I don't I don't pay for my lodging I don't pay for my food. I have a car like, but even that like I owe half of it to David. Just I don't know."
416.0,Provider,"So the not wanting to ask is is. Some pride and shame. mm hmm yeah. yeah you've been working hard, but you know just over the last year, at least since i've known you to work on your financial independence, and you know you, you are independent so many other ways so anyway, that is a big deal to. Are you ever open to having that financial arrangement with somebody again where you are kind of merged, in that way or no."
7847.0,Patient,"I am. I do like keeping separate bank accounts, which I did with brad as well. which we shared all the expenses, but we kept separate bank accounts, so a manager on money. So i'd want to continue doing that. But yeah i'd be willing to. i'll talk about it, I guess, I don't know how to."
416.0,Provider,"Take that and. But i've seen work take it or leave it just is to have one joint account that's just for like household expenses and people contribute it based on. contribute to it, based on what you're able to contribute. Right so like. put together a budget and. If you make less money than you contribute less but you're still contributing right you're still contributing like proportionate to what you may. And then, and then keep separate accounts as well, I don't know if that sounds appealing to you, but i've seen that work with other people."
7847.0,Patient,yeah i've i've tried that with my first husband and I didn't really like it too much yeah okay also is better than just communicate. what's just the problem that i'm having is communicating.
416.0,Provider,yeah well it's an uncomfortable topic. What I mean but it sounds like it has kind of a bigger meeting for you.
7847.0,Patient,"yeah. i'm not sure what it is. Like it does feel like independence, a little bit or. No, no, relying on someone else or."
416.0,Provider,I mean there's a vulnerability there.
7847.0,Patient,I don't like feeling that i'm not self sufficient. So.
416.0,Provider,What is like when you think of. self sufficiency means.
7847.0,Patient,hmm.
416.0,Provider,Was. tied up with sign up and all that for you.
7847.0,Patient,Right i'm mean I guess able to supply your own needs. For one.
416.0,Provider,"Is that an always thing, like every single time without fail."
7847.0,Patient,yeah that's how I am. perfectionist.
416.0,Provider,"What else is tied up know that. Was this a hard conversation to have in the past, when you."
7847.0,Patient,"know from the very beginning of our relationships we live together and we split all the costs of everything, like, I was very much so firm about that and we continued that throughout the longevity of our relationship. Splitting bills and all that kind of stuff."
416.0,Provider,It sounds like there was more of a power balance there.
7847.0,Patient,Right.
416.0,Provider,So it's may not be about the communication necessarily as much as it is about the financial power imbalance.
7847.0,Patient,"yeah because even though, like me and my husband split things like I was still the one keeping track of everything and. yeah just keeping track of all the bills and everything that needed to be paid."
416.0,Provider,"Okay. So it, there is something here about sort of like power and control and balance."
7847.0,Patient,yeah.
416.0,Provider,"Are there other aspects of your life, where you feel like that."
7847.0,Patient,"Transportation like I really like. have this thing with not relying on someone else to transport me somewhere. I used to when I was with my first husband. Like his dad just like always insisted on driving us places and i'm like no I can take the bus and take the subway to get there and it's fine. Then he likes just insanely insisted, because we were living with them at the time and it just like it drove me NUTS so like I have to either have a car or have a way to get places where I need to be. Where I don't feel good about things."
416.0,Provider,So there's like an escape route element to it. To be able to get out.
7847.0,Patient,"And there's some of that like escape route, I mean I don't know if I would call an escape route, but i'm with David and I like. i'm scared of what would happen if he was like no longer here. Like well what happened to me like when I get the condo when I, like you know where i'd be able to live here and take on payments or. You know what what happened, and he basically. In part of me knows that, like all my other partners would be more than willing, so let me live there. Like Jerry already calls his house our House so like I know i'd be able to live with him. mean can we're still kind of new and to dating again, so I don't know about him, but I know at least have Jerry. But even Jerry like he has retirement plans to basically sell the House getting an rv and travel places, so I don't know how that would hurt."
416.0,Provider,When you were young did you experience like housing insecurity and stuff like that.
7847.0,Patient,We were poor and we lost our first house foreclosed. Before that we were in an apartment that was owned by my mom's dad. Religion that for a long while. you're already always worried about rent all that kind of stuff.
416.0,Provider,"That makes a lot of sense, so that feeling of being vulnerable brings you right back to that place where you weren't really vulnerable. That housing insecurity. Which is I mean that's a fundamental thing that's base right it's the bottom of maslow's hierarchy. it's hard for us to really be comfortable learn grow do all the things that we need to do in our lives when we are really sure that we're gonna be okay with our basic have our basic needs met right. So for you this is this comes down to almost like a safety issue when asking for help, or rely on someone financially for these basics. You think that David understand some."
7847.0,Patient,"Well, no, have ever communicated it to him. We had like the conversation before I knew that I was going to be living here permanently of you know, this place being my place kind of a thing, so we had that conversation. And he's communicated that he wants to always live with me so there's no, you know concerned about that as long as our relationship stands. which I think it will or pretty pretty confident that it will. yeah."
416.0,Provider,"So if you were to have this discussion and kind of share this with him, what do you think is responsible. For your did let him know why it's so difficult for you to ask. for help and like kind of a history of where that comes from and all your background thoughts on all of this about like what if something happens to them and they're relying on him and then yeah."
7847.0,Patient,yeah. i'm sure he would understand. Just uncomfortable.
416.0,Provider,"yeah those are hard conversations, especially when things are going well, hard to rock the boat and. stir that up right. What do you think will happen if you don't have that conversation."
7847.0,Patient,"No, I mean, I guess, we just continue on as things go and like i'm assuming that sometime later in our relationship we have like this discussion over like you know wills and things like that. But I feel like right now it's not really too urgent of a need to talk about."
416.0,Provider,yeah.
7847.0,Patient,yeah so.
416.0,Provider,"Well, you know I mean. If he keeps bringing it up right if he keeps saying like Why can you not ask for help, or by then, and then it might become a more urgent discussion right, then you may need to have to you may need to answer that. question but. I understand your reasons for not wanting to start the conversation. No it's a seem to add some stress to you."
7847.0,Patient,"It does. Like right now I have like pretty much very little in the Bank, but he, like he just gave me money to pay off my credit cards, because he doesn't want me to pay in the interest and late fees and all that kind of stuff like you want me to pay them out completely, so I did. And what I have left isn't much like I mean, I guess, I got 15 days left will pay day or need to really do is cover my gas costs which i'm sure I can do with what's left but. yeah."
416.0,Provider,"So. Is there, I mean is spending an issue for you do. You think you had mentioned at one point, you were struggling with some. kind of impulsive spending."
7847.0,Patient,"yeah I mean I can do that occasionally. And I always put it on the credit cards which i'm sure David doesn't. But. yeah a little bit of a problem with spending. But what i'm like this, like I don't buy anything for myself. And that. To David is also like a problem, like. I shouldn't go without needing something. So. It will pretty much everything that I need he buys or we buy at a grocery runs so I never really need anything. I have a long list of wants like things that i'm saving for her. Were things that I want to get one you know the paycheck comes in, if I have enough for it. Like anytime something POPs in my head i'm like Oh, I need that I just put on the list so."
416.0,Provider,"Okay, so but it's not like impulsive getting yourself into big that kind of. Situation okay all right. No good I mean they can go with mania afraid or even hypomania so. Okay well and so. sounds like the plan is that you're not ready to have that discussion, but you all you'll. you'll be ready to have it when it's necessary."
7847.0,Patient,yeah.
416.0,Provider,But you're not ready to bring it up.
7847.0,Patient,"I don't know I haven't I haven't been tracking my news on my APP anymore, which I should do, but I know. yeah I know i've had at least one day, where I was super depressed like I wasn't self harming or anything, when I was really, really down and David asked me about it and then asked me to tell him what it was like and all that kind of stuff. But I was like maybe one or two days at the most. And then I had a day, where I felt like really hypomanic and like a lot of energy and like I need to go go, and all this kind of stuff. But that only lasted like one day. So."
416.0,Provider,Okay.
7847.0,Patient,I don't know what else was going on in my life.
416.0,Provider,"Well, we were already scheduled our for our next session on the 22nd which is just next week right so um so we can always check in Ben and I it's just a plant, the seed in your head and. Part of me wants to keep doing you know twice a month with you and do these like little short sessions just for check ins, because I know that things when things do change for you, they change quickly, and I want to make sure you're okay. And so we can we can do that the other option if you're confident that you, you are David or somebody can reach out if something does turn quickly. Is we could go down to once a month because you have been pretty stable."
7847.0,Patient,Right yeah.
416.0,Provider,"So you don't need to decide, but it's it's a thought."
7847.0,Patient,"Okay, yes, good to know. Because like you said when I do change, I do change really quick."
416.0,Provider,"So we I think we would have to, we want to have a lot of confidence that. That you are David will be able to reach out like if if anything changes quickly so that we can you know get you get you back in the fold."
7847.0,Patient,"mm hmm now Howard, David reach out when he reached out to the phone number or. What do you have to do we have."
416.0,Provider,We have a release of information for him gently.
7847.0,Patient,believe so.
416.0,Provider,"Let me double check. hold on, I have to log into my new system so i'm not gonna be able to see you for a second. So if you're making funny faces feel free. i'm hoping. Okay, hear me what your chart and see if we have releases for. Then it should be under documents. So. For David we do. Okay, so if i'm if David needed and we have an Roi for another provider Jennifer Rivera. But yeah and yeah so if if David needed to contact me and you he actually should have my email, I think, or maybe doesn't anymore, but you can give it to him."
7847.0,Patient,I can.
416.0,Provider,"i'm allowed to talk with him, because I have that Roi from him so he certainly he can certainly always reach out to me, let me know what's going on, and I can be like okay let's let's get her and let's see her right away, and then I can leave chantelle in, and we can do the whole. response so. So just fam and we don't have to do it that way, so just planting the seed right. We can decide to keep doing this to."
7847.0,Patient,Okay.
416.0,Provider,"so nice chatting with you, as always, and I will i'll See you in group. or no i'll see you next week on the 22nd. Okay sounds good. hey idea."
