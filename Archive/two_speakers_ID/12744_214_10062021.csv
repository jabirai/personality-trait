12744.0,Patient,Oh no fine Thank you.
214.0,Provider,"Okay, so what's going on."
12744.0,Patient,um. The past weeks have. been pretty good.
214.0,Provider,"Okay. So, when you say pretty good. What does that mean."
12744.0,Patient,i've been staying kind of busy a bit doing a lot. of work is still kind of annoying for this. out all. I did go out of town this past weekend I had a lot of fun they're socializing.
214.0,Provider,And how's that feel to socialize.
12744.0,Patient,"It was fine I like getting out like any like. Because I took a long I took over for a four day weekend and I went out to long beach to hang out like what's your friends. Now that's really good I like getting out. Actually, like. Not like worrying about like just work or whatever."
214.0,Provider,"So, so the reality is like the interventions we talked about about like not isolating understanding our worth understanding, you know that we should feel good about ourselves and engaging with other people there's the benefit you see a benefit to it. it's also an important fact of you isn't it."
12744.0,Patient,I think so.
214.0,Provider,Right so. When we get in that. In that neutral position. We should lean on the interventions like friends distractions taking some time off self care right some self care. Maybe that's something that you have to implement a little more of. So it becomes you know we don't feel like we're stalled.
12744.0,Patient,"yeah I didn't I didn't really think of it like that, as self care, but it definitely was."
214.0,Provider,"Okay, so what what has the self taught you about yourself or. The importance of what you get out of it."
12744.0,Patient,"I think, just like i'm. just trying to find enjoyment in life and i'm valuing myself, for I think I definitely happen. Even like. This morning because I came back like probably later yesterday."
214.0,Provider,mm hmm.
12744.0,Patient,"I was just kinda I didn't put it out something job applications at other places, just because i'm thinking like I feel really underappreciated where i'm at now. And like I don't know I just feel like I could I could do better writers are better."
214.0,Provider,do better room would respect them.
12744.0,Patient,"Just where i'm at work wise I feel like i'm definitely underpaid, and I feel like i'm just kind of underappreciated where i'm at right now but i've looked up just a little like. I said I was nervous or scared to look for a job elsewhere."
214.0,Provider,"We what we talked to we talked about that you know your although you're unhappy your fear is greater than happy to move forward. Now you're still holding on to that door knob, which is the old job you're afraid to close the door and open a new one, what would that leave you that you don't like that feeling. I get that. But then we got to worry about are we adding are we adding a lot of stress to. How do we feel about ourselves, for not moving on like it's kind of a one of those weird things right."
12744.0,Patient,"yeah. But I don't know I feel good about it because I did some applications to like different jobs. Like last night in this morning and I feel pretty confident like a couple of them I take on probably a cold or qualified for. But i've kind of at a point now where like I just really want to be, even if i'm getting paid like the same amount, I rather just work somewhere else."
214.0,Provider,"And what what, when you say work somewhere else is in the same industry."
12744.0,Patient,it's still like a fabrication while the industry.
214.0,Provider,Okay.
12744.0,Patient,it's not too far in about 30 minute meal.
214.0,Provider,"I mean, what do you think what do you think those chances are that your motivation is going to tell you that this is what you got to do like you got executed and move on."
12744.0,Patient,"I don't I feel like if I get the ball rolling more it's just like a momentum, I guess, just keep doing it. and I bet I do have some safety nets like I have savings. I have friends that live nearby that can help me out, and so I feel like. Having that safety net and thinking about that, and I feel more willing to like take bigger risks just kind of like. try something like move on."
214.0,Provider,"Okay, but but let's just let's just like look at this for a minute it's great that you have supportive friends right and it's great that you like, have a safety net, but like How long does that mean like what's not really mean I know it's there, but what how long is it there for."
12744.0,Patient,"yeah I don't know that's why I was, I was just thinking it's like a momentum I don't know how long I laughed but if I just keep moving."
214.0,Provider,"I think the idea here is. Maybe you're not saying it but i'm hearing it maybe the idea is to fall into the safety net, which forces you to move forward, am I hearing that."
12744.0,Patient,"Now. Okay, I think i'm having. i'm i'm less apprehensive about moving forward, because I have a safety net, where I used to. I used to not want to do anything because. The biggest fear I had was like Okay, if I lose my job I can't afford to live here i'll be homeless I can't feed myself wherever I don't have that kind of fear anymore."
214.0,Provider,"But how long would your friends and your money last year, I mean let's talk realistic now."
12744.0,Patient,What just with money wise I have enough for probably six months brand as friends like. That happy by go. live with that's not really an issue.
214.0,Provider,How would that feel to you and yourself values eli.
12744.0,Patient,"used to have. bye bottom because I like the idea of like being independent and I kind of working for everything I have but. I know, especially like this past week. I feel like. I could. Like. Probably rely on more rely more on people around me. And I don't think. That it makes me feel any like less than myself when I were thinking about it. When i'm thinking about it, so I did talk about this with like some of my friends this past week or."
214.0,Provider,So then. We have a great improvement of self worth and self value. yeah we're no longer feeling like scared or afraid we're feeling like we have enough support that this will be okay without impacting me mentally.
12744.0,Patient,"yeah exactly. Okay, I still have some type of like. Like I guess like. nervous a little bit, but I don't feel like it's going to like stop me from like. Trying to make like a move or try to make a career change or just a job change, I mean."
214.0,Provider,"Does it does it. Does it excite you to think about this like you know what this would be pretty cool just to take a moment for myself i've got six months in the bank I got some friends to maybe I need to just rethink where I want to go, what do I want to do is there some sky excitement about that."
12744.0,Patient,"I think there's like some yeah like especially one of the jobs, I to it's like an area that's. Not too far from here that's really cool and it's by like bunch of people, I know, and it looks like a really, really cool shop to work in I got excited to give that, if I might get that job, but you feel like just like a change and. yeah like there's some excitement to it well i'm kind of thinking like it's just something new, different."
214.0,Provider,"Do you think that. In your overall understanding of yourself, do you look at this as like a major improvement for eli eli was six months ago, where he lives thinking about now making these changes."
12744.0,Patient,"yeah yeah it's like the. I feel like i'm definitely filing myself more like by my work that like by time or like I know that I, I could do better than where i'm working at now I think under appreciated underpaid. Now i'm trying to do something about."
214.0,Provider,It when you say you're trying to do something about that what is it that you're trying to do.
12744.0,Patient,"I guess like looking for a different job, but I did like speak to my supervisors because about like possible like a raise and I should be getting one but there's this. Really stupid thing that's keeping it from happening it's just really annoying."
214.0,Provider,Which is.
12744.0,Patient,"Why i'm doing for my one year review back in May and I haven't gotten any yet. And it, I was talking to my foreman today, and he told me that is finished, like he because it hasn't got to him, and also the production manager it goes like different people and now. it's already filled out and we need our production manager to sign off on it and give it to HR and."
214.0,Provider,"Oh, my goodness."
12744.0,Patient,"yeah but um. he's out of town he's been out of town for three weeks on an install job and he won't be back, maybe till next Tuesday. So I and like it's just frustrating, because I know that. Because my format told me that, like the review was good, they are pretty satisfied with my work and I will be getting a raise and it's just like annoying to think that Okay, well, I just have to wait until I manager comes back to town to get it. has been here for almost like a year and six months now. I was supposed to get it back in May."
214.0,Provider,And how much of a raise you talking about.
12744.0,Patient,"I don't know. Because it's not a Union shop so everybody has to negotiate their own pay. But I am like really underpaid, right now, especially industry standards and California, especially on the coast, I make I make enough to like get like a small apartment here but. I don't know."
214.0,Provider,So.
12744.0,Patient,"I want to know how much the race days, because. By side, like the other jobs, I wanted. Probably like. A pair or like."
214.0,Provider,"So. What happens when the brace comes in, it falls short of what you think it is."
12744.0,Patient,"I don't know if they'll change too much because I i'm still looking for for either way and I got different job, but if it is like. If I think it's enough to where like i'm being paid like a fair wage for my Labor then i'll probably stay."
214.0,Provider,"Because I think for what are you studying for, though."
12744.0,Patient,"I I guess just the job because I have got promoted everything, other than pay goes on. Like i'm now doing, like. Because like in the shop like before I was sort of like. roscoe like I will go to different. areas and i'll help out fabricators or i'll do like small production stuff but this past week. i've been doing, like bigger units and there's this thing in the shop where they have this really big whiteboard. All the all the fabricator names and like whatever job they're working on and. This past week, like my name is up there now it hasn't been there before, but so like now I am like a fabricator there and i'm like working on units and really big stuff I have more workload I. Just. yeah so essentially they have already given me more work to do, and it is kind of satisfying I like having staying busy, and like doing something that's. kind of challenging that it kind of makes me think a lot. Rather than just like very tedious. Production stuff I was saying before. But again, like I i'm still not paid what I think I should be and that's kind of frustrating where. You know, like I got a promotion and like Labor like what's expected of me, but I haven't gotten like a pay increase reflect that."
214.0,Provider,"Right see so just be careful, you have some mixed terminology i'm not sure you're catching yourself. You know, on one hand, I see. i've been promoted, on the other hand, I see the bigger jobs, I enjoy it, and then we go back to the pay and it's like I don't know so like. You have mixed emotions to about it, not that it's a bad thing, but be careful you're not in a catch 22 where you really want to go, but then you're justifying and rationalizing why you want to stay that could be a little dangerous."
12744.0,Patient,"Why, I think I want to go just because I feel underappreciated there, and if I was paid like if I was given a ways or that reflect at my Labor. That would make me feel a lot better like I was being appreciated."
214.0,Provider,"Okay, and I don't want to take anything away from you i'm sure you're very good at what you do, but this company has waited a year and six months and still hasn't come up with any money. So even if they come up with money. Would it still not result of being on the under appreciated."
12744.0,Patient,"yeah definitely yeah I mean yeah it's really, really."
214.0,Provider,"Unless they're going to come up with $25 more now, which I hope you go, but I thought that that's true."
12744.0,Patient,yeah.
214.0,Provider,"i'm just saying you know you need to like these, these are these are things that companies do psychologically like making somebody. person in charge or foreman or supervisor and then they don't give them the money. And it's like we're going to give you all the title and all the responsibility, but we don't really appreciate you because we don't give you the money, if you want to appreciate somebody. You give them the title and the money right and what I don't want you to lose sight of, especially this weekend that you said, I have my friends that we went out, we had a good time I don't want your job to. You know suck you back into the negative hole and I don't want you to leave it either, but I want you to be real like. they're not going to come up with the money that they should. to appreciate you, but then you need to be conscious about how do I people's how do I keep my current standard of living, I agree with that, I do, but, at the second at the other hand, I also want to be reflective like. We can't really bitch about it, if we're not going to change it, we may have to step back a minute see you know what for now. i'm going to hold on to this and accept that i'm Okay, with it, instead of making these definitive lines, like, I want to be appreciated I should get a raise. Maybe we need to take a step back and say you know what when another thing becomes available that's probably when I take the leap but i'm gonna do this for now and i'm Okay, with it, like get to a little more acceptance."
12744.0,Patient,"yeah yeah. I think I could. change my way of thinking, because again like I put all the applications and. If I can other job comes up and. It looks like. it's a better opportunity I. I probably should like. Like think of it like if something if I see. If I see something that comes up I. I share it just like oh i'm already here already comfortable."
214.0,Provider,"I think it's not about being comfortable I think you're being very rational about your thinking. Where do I live, I live, where I live, I like I like i'm near the ocean near my friends, I think those are all good things, but they don't want you to do, though, is rationalized like this is the only job you love you have like. yeah don't do that what you can say is OK, so they don't appreciate me that's okay this job gives me all these other conveniences that I like right now, but if something else comes up. I may leave these conveniences because I want to be appreciated right like use that terminology to see i'm accepting but, if something else shows me appreciation on move on."
12744.0,Patient,"yeah. yeah that makes sense because. I can't do any right like right this second because I do have like bills pay and everything so but yeah. I think, like a. About owning my own following my own self bye. hey guys should I like. I guess it's more than like what i'm paid it's like how i'm being."
214.0,Provider,"Exactly. How I mean because, even if they were paying you $200 an hour they treated you like crappy you'd be in the same boat i'm not appreciated. and make a ton of money. But i'm treated like crap like there's no win right, I think you enjoy what you do I think you're very proud of what you do. But at the other hand, you want to employ doing the same thing show me something, and obviously money has a big way of talking, I agree, but on the other hand. appreciation is letting me know you appreciate you me and me now waiting almost two years for race that's not appreciating me and even if you were to give me a substantial raise I still would be behind because I should have gotten a raise over the. yeah i'm always gonna have to play catch up to, but at this point i'm going to accept the way you've treated me because I have all these conveniences that I like I like where I live, I, like my friends. it's easy, this is easy, that I like that, but if something comes about, I may give that up for that, and I think that's the way you should look at it."
12744.0,Patient,I agree.
214.0,Provider,yeah.
12744.0,Patient,"i'm I try to. I felt like I was like almost there, but now I do think I was kind of by knowing I was placing a lot on the pay raise. And I think I was kind of like. downplaying the fact that it's been over six months, or nearly six months that i've been trying to get this review, and they have a big kid and."
214.0,Provider,"You know, and then the conveniently you have a great review and there's no reason why you get and raising the guys away it's like okay so like how you know, every time i'm close to grabbing the box you keep moving it one more step and. it's like. yeah and i'm not saying i'm not saying that that make you feel bad what i'm saying is, these are tactics that employers use to keep good employees, they do. But the idea here is you still feel value there you still feel like you know you enjoy what you do, you have these other things that's fine everybody has other things. But the idea here is, you know, right now, you just add acceptance i'll get the reason on get the race, but i'm still going to put my feelers out, just in case something else comes my way i'm going to take it. And I think that's a great way to know you're not stuck but you still moving forward right. Right cool, so let me take a look at some other than you seem to be in good spirits, you seem. To be like enjoying life like you're in life."
12744.0,Patient,yeah I definitely have like just getting out more socializing like. Sure just living but yeah work is still just like one little thing that's always kind of. dragging.
214.0,Provider,Good no no suicidal ideations nothing something. that's great.
12744.0,Patient,yeah that's great.
214.0,Provider,To hear.
12744.0,Patient,"yourself, for it like. Like by but again yeah."
214.0,Provider,"Give yourself credit right we feel you look at what you've done for yourself don't don't you know don't get into of that you know this was there and I did this. I decided to assist in these changes, I participated in my changes now i'm reaping the benefits and I want to continue to reap the benefits that's how you got to stay in it right you're the winner you're the one that's making things move, and I think that's important. So. Twice a month. hmm. So why did that go back. So you only see me twice a month right that's what we agreed to."
12744.0,Patient,yeah our next one is going to be on average somewhere.
214.0,Provider,"Twice a month, you still go to group weekly or every other week."
12744.0,Patient,Is weekly I did miss yesterday.
