726.0,Provider,hi how are you.
11778.0,Patient,"i'm doing Okay, how are you."
726.0,Provider,"i'm good, how are you feeling."
11778.0,Patient,"um you know. I I had. A feeling Okay, you know I had another scan data and I got the results yesterday and i'm good progress on the parasites from the last scan so all of those um. You know I would say, I had about. 10 different parasites, I was dealing with on the last game, and none of those were on this game and i'm dealing with for parasites now. And so I. I i'm just I have my writing. protocols for those specific parasites. And i'm so i'm you know, and I haven't I haven't started writing just yet, but i'll start tonight and overnight sets at bedtime."
726.0,Provider,For it sounds better than hand right because.
11778.0,Patient,"yeah it was. wow 10 or 12 last time. And I had. a pretty good list of at least 10, and so my the practitioner that I work with um she she was very encouraging and. But she wants me to to my detox pathways are are stagnant meaning they're little they're not moving fast enough. Because i've been doing a lot of qe. there's a full moon this weekend, but after that she wants me to not. Take any type of. Clean cleanser to kill for two weeks. Okay, but she said, I can rise, but because she's trying to help to clear up my pathways my. Face so yeah. So i'm. i'm dry brushing i've decided i'm going to dry brush at least two to three times a day and I have a full body vibration unit. That I cannot depend on and it drains lymphatic."
726.0,Provider,So i'm not afraid.
11778.0,Patient,Now so i'm going to dry brush. Before getting on that and i'm going to do that i'm gonna try to do that three times a day. yeah yeah.
726.0,Provider,"sounds like you're making progress in the right direction, four out of 10 that's that's awesome."
11778.0,Patient,"yeah yeah i'm. i'm pleased, but I still i'm still dealing with um I can still feel some parasites. But I can tell they're different they're not like before. So i'm dealing with another group and hopefully. After this scan i'm just gonna i'm gonna stay really positive and. That i'm gonna. have one or none to deal with that are stressing my system, because you know i'm told we all have parasites, but mine have gotten you know a bit out of out of sync out of control, so that's why i'm dealing with what i'm dealing with."
726.0,Provider,"That must have been quite a journey, because in it's not like you were very busy person before having this I remember our first session and you were saying how you were working on the time and kind of like go go go, so this is really slowed it now."
11778.0,Patient,"Oh yeah i'm just this has changed my life um. And my husband, you know he tells me, you know you. i'm doing better now I get outside a little bit now and I walk and so forth, but he's saying you know, a person. He says you're going through a depression, because you're staying up in this bedroom upstairs all the time, and I was staying upstairs in the bedroom quite a bit. But I was doing things related, but I was focused on myself, you know because I do foot baths there's some detoxification foot baths associated with the writing and it's sometimes they're like an hour hour and a half, each program and I like to run maybe two or three in a day. yeah so um but yeah but I haven't I haven't gotten but the one thing I have not gotten back to doing is cooking. And i'll cook my vegetables that I I eat but but cooking for the family, my husband has just been a sweetheart um and he's been you know he goes to work and he comes home and he just. He makes sure that. You know that I eat and that he eats and he's but he's told me I gotta do better. I got he says, this is the last book."
726.0,Provider,well.
11778.0,Patient,"i'm hoping that you know next month, I can you know integrate you know. Get back into yeah yeah."
726.0,Provider,"Do you think it's it. Is it that you don't really enjoy cooking that lunch like do, what do you think is the reason that you haven't."
11778.0,Patient,"Well, I did cook for thanksgiving because I do that, every year, but emotionally I just haven't been focused I just haven't you know. i've been just so wrapped up in what i'm feeling and. i'm trying to stay positive and. You know yeah so even yesterday, I asked him I said, what are you going to eat for dinner. Because I wanted to know what I was gonna eat too, but. But. There was there were left over, so I was fine. You told me I ate a sandwich at one o'clock so i'm flying so that meant that I had to figure it out."
726.0,Provider,"Are you on a special diet, with these parasites like do you eat meat or anything or yeah."
11778.0,Patient,"I do, I do eat meat fruit for the protein um I eat very low fat I I am on a special diet, I. And you know I I do eat meat for my protein and I eat you know, vegetables, I do eat brown rice, I made bake a yam you know, but I don't I don't eat like fatty foods, I don't eat sugar I don't eat little to no carbs but i've been dropping some weight. So every now and then i'll I may eat some car or something to to kind of help me because I don't know. I kind of think that my weight loss might have to do with my thinking and my my whole condition. You know. Because I had gotten down to my weight like like when I got married several months ago. And that was a really tough time for me because I didn't know and my family didn't know what was going on, because I. get it yeah um. And that was the time where I wasn't getting sleep and my my parents talked me into going to last encinitas. And that's how I got connected with bright heart, and so I had to get some medication to help me sleep. So once I was able to sleep. My hope my person now I you know I started gaining I actually gained some weight, while I was in Las encinitas because I I had to eat what they gave me and I ate three meals, a day and I actually gained about four pounds while while I was there and. But now I don't i'm not. i'm like 148 right now 148 which is not a bad wait for my height that's fine, but when I first started, I was at 175. that's a lot of weight that i've lost but it's healthier for me. But I don't want to lose any more."
726.0,Provider,yeah yeah. you've been through this health journey it's like.
11778.0,Patient,The different.
726.0,Provider,"versions, or like your body changing and. yeah yeah I mean that the body feeling like it's changing because you're losing the weight and also then on top of that all of the medical things that you're doing that the holistic approaches that you're using. yeah yeah but it sounds like the holistic approach is is giving you a feeling of hope, though. Because I can imagine that was very hard at the beginning, not. Oh, what was going on."
11778.0,Patient,"yeah you wouldn't imagine, I was in tears, most of the time, I still get a little emotional."
726.0,Provider,But i'm.
11778.0,Patient,"Happy i'm kind of cry now but. yeah just to talk about the stuff that I went through emotionally to end people thinking that I was crazy and you know yeah it was it was really, really tough, it was tough but i'm i'm very hopeful male and I know I have to just stay focused and stay positive and. One of the things I told my husband, I said what would really make me happy if we could shop for. A new mattress so that he needs an adjustable mattress so that he can come back so that we can sleep together because right now he's he sleeps in a recliner i'm. In the bedroom but. i'm in the bed by myself. yeah um but anyway, we will see, we have to work up to that um. Maybe next month we'll be able to start looking."
726.0,Provider,"yeah. yeah I mean it is one of the things I talk to me about about wanting to have more intimacy with your husband, too, because this has also gotten. has changed the I guess that relationship quite a bit just because of the different roles that you guys are playing."
11778.0,Patient,"yeah yeah yeah um. He. You know. He overheard me talking to the practitioner yesterday about my scan and. He said, did that lady said you had lice. I said I said she didn't really say it was a life, she said it was some type of bacteria and it's related to line lyme disease. and She said it's something that i'm. Like a mite when he overheard him and so he says he says, oh no he says. So he it's like he feels he's gonna catch something. So I have to work on, will have to work on that he'll he'll soften up will have to just go online and look at it more specific and. You know, but that's i'll have to work."
726.0,Provider,On the issue before you got the like the diagnosis and before you found out what you had what did anything was there any significant life changes that were happening during that time.
11778.0,Patient,"um. Well, I don't know if I shared with you that my dad told me he had a dream, did I tell you that."
726.0,Provider,"Yes, that he had a dream."
11778.0,Patient,"That I was going to be attacked by having a 10. yeah yeah Okay, so I told you that i'm. The only significant um I would say. change was that I realized it came it came out, I should say. That my past trauma. and I have never shared it with my husband."
726.0,Provider,or.
11778.0,Patient,"You can bear married 35 years. And he has a major in psychology and so he's zeroed in on it, and he said that was a date, rape, he says, this is what because my husband has always been the one he always said that I, I never give him 100% you know. So anyway, he was he was he was very upset. But I told him I didn't keep that from him purposely because I I just I didn't know I just thought that it was you know, I was you know, I was engaged to him, so it wasn't a big deal, but he told me that he's the one who bought it about that has been the most I should say. signal. thing related to my marriage. yeah and that's why I want to make sure I don't carry I release all the baggage, you know and that i'm not carrying anything moving forward. But. I don't you know. I didn't know what was going, I can tell you that I didn't know how, when I was losing the weight I didn't know if I was coming or going I didn't know. And I think other people didn't know whether I was dying with something or if I had some type of grave illness I didn't know either, but. um yeah but it's i'm working through it and and things are getting better."
726.0,Provider,"So Tommy like. During during the times when you have downtime and you're not doing the self care. about the racing or anything um how are you feeling like what are i'm sure it's like maybe a lot of emotions have been coming off since, since all of this."
11778.0,Patient,"And you mean my emotions. yeah um. You know. I i'm in some some groups like forums online groups large groups where I can, where I can there's other people that are dealing with the same thing that i'm dealing with and some of them. Are it seems like they're just going on with their lives and they do, they just so i've been you know um. it's take I I had not been able to wrap my. head around having a normal life um I haven't been. You know it's and you know of course that i'm not vaccinated either I don't want the vaccine um so that kind of keeps limits on me also. But. I you know. I just. You know it's it's just been an emotional. drain you know I can tell you that, and I just tried to talk to. whomever I can you know whether it's a friend or my parents, because they're very supportive to keep me moving forward and staying positive um. And yesterday when I got my skin it it just. kind of solidified that to me that you know what you can do this. One of one of the things on the scan report, it says it tells me, and it has on here a belief statement it says, I believe I can be healthy, this is something that they want me to continually. proclaim you know affirmation."
726.0,Provider,To say it half.
11778.0,Patient,"A lot and several times a day because I guess, they can pick up from my skin that. You know there's some emotions that. are tied to having health issues, you know."
726.0,Provider,"Yes, yes yeah. So right now i'm like i'm asking questions because I i'm not as familiar with with parasites are So where are they all like the ones that you have right now, where do you feel in your body."
11778.0,Patient,"i'm the mage them most of them, I feel, in my legs and my feet. But. I do. I do have movement in my head sometimes not as much. Not not as much so. And when I if I wake up to go use the bathroom like about four or five o'clock in the morning, I feel them they're they're moving around. My torso you know my abdomen and and that's something I I didn't really feel in my abdomen area before this last. Before this last scan so i'm dealing with a new parasite new new different parasites that were their patterns are a little different. So, but i'm hoping what now that I have the protocols, the writing protocols for the specific you know, then I can start knocking these out and and where I you know i'm not feeling that activity. You know. You know, early in the morning or late at night I don't mind doing the activity where they're leaving because that's what a lot of the activity, I do feel. They know travel up they'll go into. there's like a spinster valve it's connected to my digestive tract. it's like right. between my breath but."
726.0,Provider,yeah I could.
11778.0,Patient,"feel them, I can feel them go in and they go into my digestive tract and then they of course they go out the other way."
726.0,Provider,I got it.
11778.0,Patient,"But it's it's I sometimes I get heavy movement i'm at least before this last scan I got a lot of heavy movement, and I can feel the relief, you know in my body that they exit their lead left. yeah so um. that's. You know the practitioner that I talked to she says she's never had she's never she's had parasites before, and she went through something similar to me, but not as bad as me, but she said that she's never known anybody that can feel that so hypersensitive like me we're. Connected to. The activity that I feel. yeah parasites."
726.0,Provider,"I know that sounds like a strange suggestion, but I wonder if you um if you had a conversation with your body and telling those parasites so be like, I wonder, you know how because I know that you're Christian and I know that your family's very much believes in prayer. I wonder if you proclaim that this is my vessel, this is my body. Yes, I am I am asking you to to go away, I want you to leave or something. along those lines."
11778.0,Patient,"i'm i've definitely done that, before i'm more of a command yeah. And, and I have had some movement from that lately I I used to do it all the time, but I used to vocalize it and my husband would get upset with me because he was trying to sleep um but um I I definitely I kind of. Like like I do coffee enemas and so. When I do that that's like my time it's like i'm in the bathroom it's like my time my prayer time and I do a lot of affirmations. And I pray, and so I do definitely make. Those declarations, when I have that that you know quiet time for my."
726.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
11778.0,Patient,um but yeah I I definitely um we'll start back you know even like right before I go to bed. i'll definitely do that.
726.0,Provider,"yeah cuz I mean i'm wondering just that that connection with your body and in having the conversation with the body, even though, even though everybody. You know the world we live in it's like everything they put everything separate from each other, but really like it's it's a whole system."
11778.0,Patient,yeah it's.
726.0,Provider,"Working together, and so I wonder if I wanted to actually try something with you today, this is along the lines of. Of the work that we're going to be doing. Okay, so um I want you to just focus in on the sensations that happened in your body, so it just focus nate if you were to scan your bike from the top of your head to your feet Where would you feel any of these movements happening."
11778.0,Patient,i'm writing my legs. Right in your life okay legs. A little bit in my abdomen but mostly my legs right now.
726.0,Provider,"Okay, so this is what we're doing today so um I told you about em Dr, so this is this is also part of the mdm but we're not processing a memory. or an event we're going to just be processing what's happening in your body, because sometimes doing this can help you get some insight or some information that's connected to the to the parasite i'm thinking. And like I said I like to be curious and just keep an open mind so let's just see what happens. Okay, so what you you don't have to actually do anything except just follow my fingers with your eyes okay. And just focusing on what happens in your body um when you think about let's start with your feet, how you feel them in your feet and I want you to follow my fingers on the screen."
11778.0,Patient,"Okay, can you hold on one, second, I want to. Get grab something really quick."
726.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
11778.0,Patient,Okay i'm ready.
726.0,Provider,"Perfect so before we start I like to set an intention for the body and the mind and we're and you can just gently ask your body to just. If there's anything that you want to know any information that's connected to these parasites for for them to show up whatever it is that you're ready to to know at this time okay. So your brain is is gonna give you information or you're going to start feeling sensations in your body it's totally normal it's part of that process okay. So I want you to just follow my fingers Okay, and just focus in on what's happening. Anything show up."
11778.0,Patient,In terms of what I feel.
726.0,Provider,You have anything come up when you were following the fingers.
11778.0,Patient,When you say anything come up you mean a sensation or.
726.0,Provider,Be sensations images thoughts that pop up.
11778.0,Patient,um.
726.0,Provider,"it's Okay, if you didn't get anything that's fine."
11778.0,Patient,"No, I didn't I didn't really get anything. Okay yeah."
726.0,Provider,"No that's Okay, so what I asked you, is when you follow my fingers you don't want to move your head you just want your eyes to do the work. Okay Okay, if I go too slow or too fast just let me know cuz, then I can accommodate it to your comfort level okay. Okay, so just focusing on the feet and. And how you were saying how you feel them usually it down where your feet are okay."
11778.0,Patient,"um I. There was some little fluttering at the at the beginning, but it didn't it subsided um. and And i'm soaking my feet right. yeah because I have a another 15 minutes to go, so one of the programs. But. Just just a little. There was some movement at the very beginning, and then it stopped."
726.0,Provider,"Okay. You want to continue on. But it's up to you, we can we can continue like you know, having our session."
11778.0,Patient,yeah we could yeah let's continue.
726.0,Provider,"So so let's do one more time and I want to see if if any connections between the parasites in your emotions come up. Sorry, so let's see let your brain over wants to, because sometimes when someone starts doing this, if they're thinking a lot about what they're doing it's you have to just let your brain kind of go where wants to go, because it knows what it's doing it's your body processing something. So let's just see what happens if. Maybe there's a connection between parasites and the emotions and and if we don't get anything that's okay. we're just going to try it let's be curious and just see what happens okay. Good alright so just follow my fingers."
11778.0,Patient,"You know I felt I did feel some emotion during that one um. You know. feeling. know the feeling of not having control, you know um. That has been something that. has been my biggest challenge through this the course of this whole journey. Because i've always been one to have a plan, a or plan B or be in control, you know. But I I. It has it has. I. learned definitely learn i'm learning patience, but it is something that. Really. it's been the most difficult part because it's like I want to make it right, I want to make things right for myself for my family but I it's out of my control. So. i've got a head cold, let me blow my nose but. yeah i'm. As far as I can remember, going back to you know. School you know college high school i've always been one to. A. Somewhat of an introvert but but. i've been very organized and planning and setting goals and doing things i've always had. You know i've always written down, you know my goals and and and having a plan. And so. And that's been my life i've been very structured. But this is just taken me all out of my element, you know so um. But. I guess it's it's it's it's been. You know it's a positive in a way to tip. So that i'm not so i'm. thinking that you know you know, I have to release I can't control everything you know so."
726.0,Provider,wonder where that comes from.
11778.0,Patient,"to want to be in control. You know I just know that. You know what. Since the past trauma has come up I, I know that I wasn't not in control when that happened and. Emotionally it really took me. It took me it took me down for a while, because. You know because I I. lost my virginity you know, and that was something I prized you know. And so. You know I I went through I guess it took me a couple of months to get over all of that, you know you know the breakup and the whole bit you know, and what I did I I ended up buying me a new car and that kind of helped distract me, you know. and And I I do find that that's what I do, I trust i'll buy something um you know even for for other other people, you know to. You know, I think that I I don't. I don't put the time. You know, it takes work to put the time in to. To. To develop you know relationships and you've got to put the time in and and I just know even when I had my kids. I didn't bond with my daughter, and so I bonded with my son somewhat, but still. You know, and I just remember remember. With them coming up, I would buy something you know to to. To make them to please them, you know, but I didn't put in the work you know. You know that deeper relationship that bond and that's The thing that I think i've. i've lacked probably in a lot of my relationships. And with my husband. You know he's he's a sweetheart you know um. he's always wanted to he tried to pull you know things out of me, and I would kind of you know. close down a little bit. You know I realized that now that you know I didn't know that it was the past trauma, but I realize now that I definitely want to put in the work I was what moving forward for our relationship to to blossom you know, and I want our intimacy to be I want. You know I want communication I want better communication I was the one that wasn't communicating. with him. From the heart, you know it was more superficial, you know um. But arm. yeah so. I. So I mean yeah. I don't know if you want to have something to say."
726.0,Provider,"No i'm wondering, too, if you know. Part of it sounds from listening to you is this feeling of wanting to be in control right and then. And how that that past event that happened to you, you know it wasn't with your consent, so that feels completely out of your control. yeah and I almost think that you wanting to build these relationships to be deeper and to feel more meaningful. With your family. I almost wonder if that will be part of your physical healing as well, because I wonder if if part of it is that feeling of guilt or shame about that."
11778.0,Patient,"yeah I definitely was that guilt and shame and that's why. I. You know I told my I told my mom you know and. I was very emotional and share that with her um. I don't I don't I really don't know why I didn't share it with my husband. um. yeah. I don't I don't know. Because. You know I now I try and and talk, talk very you know communicate with him and share my innermost. You know desires, you know I do that now, but sometimes I think he. Because of everything that's going on and what. He would I don't know if he doesn't. You know I don't know I don't get the same response, like, I think I should like, I would have gotten like years and years ago. You know i'm. well. Because he's he's gone through counseling himself and. Because of this, you know because of how this past trauma of bide has affected our relationship so he's gone counseling himself. yeah I um. I I really feel that i've released all of it. yeah and and but you know of course he. yeah he wants it to be more structured and official by have going through therapy."
726.0,Provider,I sing.
11778.0,Patient,So that I know because he wants me he says he wants me to to take care of me first. and make sure that i'm good. And then we can move on to our relationship. yeah so.
726.0,Provider,"that's not healthy that sounds like a healthy perspective. has been. But you know, I think it do you think that you didn't tell him because at some level you felt like. um. It I don't think it has so much to do with the whole trust, if not Maybe it was a way of not becoming uncomfortable with with. with him, maybe like you know, like once you tell somebody something it's like you want to make sure they don't keep bringing it up because maybe it's something that you just wanted to forget about I wonder if. You did that, just because you just wanted to forget about it and not. have to go back to that time."
11778.0,Patient,"You know I I didn't even I didn't even think I. I took on a victim. Like the attitude of a victim, because I felt that it wasn't my fault, you know I shouldn't have gotten the backseat of the car um. But maybe I didn't want him to judge me um I kind of wish I would have shared it with him earlier but I, in my mind, I think I had just tucked it away I had. And the reason why it came out. um it's because someone was praying for, for me, and they begin to to tell me. to release some things you know from when I was a teenager when I was young. yeah when I was a child, so some things came up as a child and and that I shared and then I began to talk about how. This the guy that I was engaged to how he he took my virginity and I began to weep and cry and I never done that, before and and that that was the very first time, my husband had heard it too, so of course he's you know shocked and. that's how. You do. It all. evolved."
726.0,Provider,"You know. I invite you in there, I would you be comfortable, then you know how you proclaim you know with your body, you tell it on to the parasites to go away right. I wonder if you can reclaim that virginity because, even though it was a physical act right for you, for you, it was more than just a physical act, it was really like something that was special to you and it's like is there a way that you know through prayer. Through writing it's like. Through proclaiming like I take back my power like that that was mine. That was mine."
11778.0,Patient,"Yes, I."
726.0,Provider,wasn't he he doesn't own that he doesn't take that.
11778.0,Patient,yeah. I can do that.
726.0,Provider,"just see what happens like you know, once you do it see what happens in your body How does that feel when you when you say it out loud, or when you think it. happens like. Something happened, do you feel some resistance with it, it just anchor come up just get curious about it and proclaim it back it's yours, this is i'm taking this back. So what happened to my body when I say that oh my God it's been a long time."
11778.0,Patient,Okay.
726.0,Provider,"Okay. So we'll nisha we're almost. Like wrapping up with time. So I want to make sure that we have an appointment set up for. For next time. Now I am going to be taking some time off for the holidays um so I have availability in the first week of April, after the New Year um is there any specific day or time that you would like to.
