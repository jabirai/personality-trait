16106.0,Patient,"But we talked before. But i've spent the night over there three times already, and he caught up and honest others ship. But now i'm like you know I, this is my goal like you know I do want to be married and all this stuff but I don't want to play house and I. i'm now i'm thinking now like now that i've had time to myself, because I have them been at my grandfather's house i've been at his house. First night with me being here so i'm thinking and i'm just like are you moving too fast, like way. You need to think about this like I know. Like. You need to really think about this. So I don't know."
759.0,Provider,"yeah well it's been since the last time I talked to you spend two weeks and we spent a week with him at his house are often on and you feel like you're moving too fast, like it's going too fast."
16106.0,Patient,I don't know if I am or not.
759.0,Provider,"mm hmm. Well, in terms of you know, some people move fast, some people may slow, you know what do you feel like your comfort level is."
16106.0,Patient,"Like I would want to be with him. You know. And really because it's like I don't feel like we're moving fast, because when you're in a relationship you're getting to know that person so whether or not like, if I was to marry him it's still will be a journey of getting to know who. We are. So I don't feel like i'm moving fast in that sense, but i'm thinking like I you know what i'm thinking like i'm thinking long term like I don't want to play House like I want to be married, I want to be. He has kids like I want to be a step mom you know stuff like that. But is that what he's thinking. You know. that's where i'm at with it like okay you're moving fast, but. I know this is what you want, but what does he want."
759.0,Provider,yeah you.
16106.0,Patient,"can be on two different levels, I don't know."
759.0,Provider,yeah you can want something totally different yeah yeah so you really liked him what's about him depth you like.
16106.0,Patient,"I like that it feels familiar, like the moment like I got on the elevator with him, I was just like I don't know it just felt like I knew him in another lifetime like. develop hillier like I know him I don't know."
759.0,Provider,How but yeah.
16106.0,Patient,"It really. It natural and. I don't know I like that he gives me that he has a demanding job, but he still prioritises me cause me checks in with me. Nice, you know I like that he's established he's a producer, he was there, and he was signed before by jermaine dupri. Oh, I like that he's established in the entertainment field like that's what I. The songwriter he he doing everything that I want to do."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16106.0,Patient,I feel like having him as a connection that's good like.
759.0,Provider,yeah how all this thing.
16106.0,Patient,he's 35.
759.0,Provider,"Is 35 you're still in your 20s right 20 757 yeah okay well, he is not that far in a trim yo you know. That that's even di he's not that far in age."
16106.0,Patient,"And then he was saying things like. We need to make the bed, and like I need to make my side of the bed like he he's from my understanding, it sounds like he's looking for long term. Oh, because when I met him in person he kind of was just like telling me like how he is like he's high maintenance and certain things that he. You know, requires or he wants and i'm just thinking like well that's natural the things that you're requiring like that's just who I am like that's not nothing to me like. yeah I mean certain things that he does and i'm just like we get along like. I got told my mom I said he wants, you know they make the bed like he makes a big deal but i'm making the bed, and my mom said, will you make your bed every day so that's not a problem. Natural things that I do he he that's why I was like I feel like it's. from that."
759.0,Provider,"yeah natural yeah because you guys have. A lot in common. yeah. Well, you know, in terms of what you want, and what you need. You know, wants and needs can be different, you know, like in terms of. What you need from him if you need you know, to establish like if this is going to be a long term commitment. I think you know you have to write to xm you know it's just going to be something that is you know going to it's just just a fling are unnecessary trouble you know, so I think he you know, having the conversation with him early on, because you don't want to get to attach."
16106.0,Patient,"Right from add like I don't want to me especially like spinning, and I was somebody that's easy to get attached to them."
759.0,Provider,"yeah it's easy to get in touch you know, so I think you gotta you know say early on, but where is this headed like do you, you know feel like we can be long term, or is this just a fling for you or something that is you know this uh you know, like. Something that's not going to last for too long, you know I think you're well within your right to access them and have that conversation because that's something like you feel like you need. yeah oh yeah so yeah I think Kevin a conversation with him did he call you back last night. No well that's a red flag, a little bit for flag, you know because he's supposed to get back to."
16106.0,Patient,yeah. So that's why i'm like. I feel like. I don't want to let the crazy out the bag and what I mean by that is like I don't want to.
759.0,Provider,Press wrong. yeah.
16106.0,Patient,"And so that's why I was kind of conflicted on like how do I address this, I do I mentioned it or do I go with the flow, you know but i've done that in the past. And I. do that so hearing you say that it's like okay that's confirmation like I can move forward and don't be afraid of saying I do need that. You know I need. reassurance, I need to know I need to have some type of understanding on how to. maneuver."
759.0,Provider,"Because when you know you know. And you know right you don't want to just have it just be like you know run of the mill you know club two things you know so. yeah you know, I think, establishing that it's going to be a good thing for you and you know some growth like if you're able to do that, you know for yourself because, like you said in the past, you had let things go with the flow and it didn't work out for you. yeah."
16106.0,Patient,yeah I think that's good.
759.0,Provider,"yeah and be confident you know, like be confident that you are someone were fattening. Right you're worth you're worthy of love and worthy of everything that comes with it. You know so. yeah just say you know hey baby, you know, are we, you know, like do you feel like this can be something that is going to be, you know. A relationship, you know, in terms of how you know you see me and I, together in a feature, or is this just something that you know it's just going to be short term for you or how do you feel about the way things are going and see if he get it answered."
16106.0,Patient,So checking in I think that's a great idea.
759.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
16106.0,Patient,yeah i'm going that.
759.0,Provider,"yeah I think you should do that you know, so you can you know feel secured, you know, like it's just going to be something out secured yeah. yeah but kudos to you, you got yourself a home man before you, since our last session."
16106.0,Patient,"Better though it gets better. that's Sunday okay so his name is travis but he he goes by, he has a stage name juvie so I call him if I say juvie or travis that's the same person. I. Lawrence the ex. boyfriend the old guy. He thought Sunday."
759.0,Provider,What does he want.
16106.0,Patient,"Sunday.

So I said Oh, that was a good thing you know, and he and I said, you know you know what do you want or whatever and he's like oh it's too late. And I like. Late but i'm thinking like I wasn't going to meet with him because I don't. Have a desire to see. That yeah."

16106.0,Patient,"And it's been going ever since and then Lawrence caught me again. Oh, my. God, I want to say he called. Tuesday or. or Monday. mm hmm and it was funny because, on Sunday, when he caught know on Tuesday, before I connected with travis I was thinking like plot like pre meditating on what I was gonna say to him, like. Am I don't want to do him stop calling me keep me blocked, you know cuz he was unblocking me when he wasn't around his girlfriend and then blocking me like just keep me black leave me. yeah about like what I was going to say TIM next time I talk to him, and then, when he called me I didn't even feel that way anymore, and I kind of I was like man I fabricated the story a little bit of like. He called and he said Oh, how are you and I was like i'm good and he was like. Are you busy, and I usually means I always want to try and see me on my lunch break or something and I was like yep very busy, and he says, oh Thank you so much for not calling me and I was like what."
759.0,Provider,yeah. That mean.
16106.0,Patient,"Well you're busy, I just want to say hi i'm going to try and call you in a month. I say yeah. About that I said. The reason I haven't called you is because I got a boo like. Oh i'm so happy for you, I said yeah and I live with him now so stop calling me. And he was like okay well i'll talk to you later i'll say goodbye."
759.0,Provider,"Now, goodness gracious you gotta you gotta just nip that in the bud. yeah if he doesn't he has a fabricator little bit, but still just nip it in the bud. That yeah."
16106.0,Patient,"yeah cuz i'm like the fact that he thinks that I would wait a month for him, like i'm. Oh, he."

16106.0,Patient,"yeah and he, like and another thing that I like about him is like Lawrence has seven kids. wow and he never like I never met them only met like one or two and I knew one of his daughters before him so that's how I met like you know some of these kids but he always kept separate, and I felt like. That was the issue like they had a problem with me and they really didn't know me and."
759.0,Provider,It like.
16106.0,Patient,"It just was too much in this like he, like Lawrence will be like Oh well, my son is getting in a car like i'll call you back, he would never talked to me on the phone in front of them or.

There was when she was like you don't have a real problem, she pissed me off that's the last time I talked to her, and I was like. Last month, or go like that was a while ago so she was also everything worked out and I just looked at my mom and mom was I just tell her yeah because I don't want her my business like. she's just like she she looks like oh so once I just tell her yeah and I was like yeah so everything she asked me I just haven't done it yet yeah yeah and then she's like. Oh, why you sound like that I said because i'm pressed for time, like, I have four hours is me and my mom I have to move everything out. Like I don't have time for these I just need to drop off refrigerator so, then I drive all the way to her apartment. And I see a text message from my cousin saying Oh well, we were anticipating you to bring the refrigerator bad we don't have anywhere, to put it so you have to keep it or throw it in the trash. And i'm like. All are and i'm like i'm outside and she was at what we can keep the refrigerator refrigerator was outside behind her parked car there's nothing i'm sending out front front of her apartment like there's i'm looking at her car. there's no. idea, she can take refrigerator. At because I didn't tell them because they've been called and trying to see what's going on with me and I didn't tell them what's going on with me. yeah I will call her the day before and said hey i'm coming out there i'm dropping off refrigerator it would have been different, but the fact that I didn't say anything they feel some type of way about it. So I. said Okay, and I just hung up the phone and i'm blocked her I haven't talked to her residents and then I see, I can see, on my laptop when blah blah people text me and she takes me like five days after that and was like oh hey needs is checking on me checking on me you just be a nosy. concerned, you would have called me the day after, I know you know, whatever just wanted to see how, if you were really concerned you're not concerned."

So why. You should have been, and then you call me like six minutes after that six times and trying to make it seem like you've tried to call know you'd be a messy you when. I told you, I was dropping off refrigerator you went in a room I know exactly what you did wrong talk to your daughter yeah I was communicated and that's how it happened because housing that she texted me three minutes after that she wasn't even involved.

On her name and she took a screenshot of it and sending it to the family talking and gossip and I said see that there's just too much. yeah. Too much and y'all want me to associate with that, like why y'all you don't even check on her, she just had a birthday. you're in called her y'all need to talk to her every time you i'll talk about today, they say Oh well, she came into the family history, they came in the family, when she was 14. mm hmm that's her dad didn't want him her dad you know want her around us.
