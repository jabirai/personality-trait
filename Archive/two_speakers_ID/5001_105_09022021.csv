ID,Role,Message
105.0,Provider,let's check audio let's make sure we got.
5001.0,Patient,Good. Okay it's because it wasn't recording it. How are you.
105.0,Provider,i'm fine Thank you and yourself you're in Florida.
5001.0,Patient,"know we missed your flights attorney we're leaving and like it like two hours, as I was, like nine giardia impact those. gonna do your call shower head to the airport. yeah it's been a crazy few days, a few weeks, few."
105.0,Provider,weeks yeah. Just thinking back to some of the things you were sharing last time there's no shortage of things to think about. If you notice this last week.
5001.0,Patient,"yeah you know, I think. I noticed that i'm stronger than I think I am I have noticed that. i'm um. That part of life is just kind of this roller coaster of emotion or events happening in our lives and as all what we decided to do with it, I guess you know and just kind of the choices we make and i'm kind of just interrupt collecting on the fact that you know. I think I told you this before, but when I was going through my mom's pictures. and watching their progression. You know the drugs and whatever. And then so and then. Being at the celebration of life, you know, and I never particularly liked my mom and I never particularly get along with her thought of her as anything other than. kind of an ass you know it kind of a not a nice person, but there was people at our celebration of life that spoke in that we're really touched by her you know at like friends and family and that were genuinely touch fire, so it was nice to see that. Even though I may have seen a side of her that maybe they didn't or maybe I have experiences or resentments that I haven't gotten rid of she really did live. a pretty good life and that made me happy, you know, and so that was good and then coming home and then you know these little girls. Like their parents on Monday, decided that they're going to they told the judge that they want to relinquish rights and. And the judge said, you know let's wait a little while so you know, like so that's not something you regret later and but that seems like the path that it's going down so then. really looking at these two. Really challenging but beautiful little girls, you know it's like Okay, this is a clue there's a reason for it, and I know we talked last time, like. there's lots of kids that need help and there is there is, it gives me hope that is true. But you know I think at the end of the day, like I am there's a reason why i'm here and there's a reason why becky's here and there's a reason why becky and I are. In the best place we've ever been in a relationship when these kids came in and we've done nothing but grow closer honestly, which is strange, but. But you know it's just I don't know I feel like sometimes I think there's no way to do this, and then I do it, and then I. Then I reflect back like wow damn way stronger than I thought of like I thought I was you know I never thought I could get through celebration of life without being intoxicated in some way, shape or form, you know. And I wasn't I was in my 100% for right mind and I felt good I felt like I looked good I felt like I represented myself and my family and the. upward most positive possible you know, like way like I felt like it just all worked out, so it just made me really reflect that i'm not i'm not as weak as I think I am."
105.0,Provider,So I wrote some of what you just said down. case you forget.
5001.0,Patient,"Now, thank you. It has been it's been you know I mean when I don't know i've spent the last four and a half years or four years little over four years, like. really thinking of myself as this like. Like broken person, you know and and. And I still think of myself like that, sometimes, but for all, most of them, but lately I just feel like wow okay Nicole like here, you know, and I know this is like kind of somewhat shallow but. But I was able to put together this beautiful celebration of life and my brother helps but, for the most part, I was able to do it myself and. You know, as becky's helping whatever but and it ended up being great and if I was on drugs before like would have been a wreck you know and. Whatever, and so I think I just have always thought like oh you can't do that or oh you're not good enough for that or that's not something you'll be able to. Like whatever something will happen like you'll mess it up, somehow, but I don't know it things seem to be coming together pretty well."
105.0,Provider,But a nice change.
5001.0,Patient,yeah.
105.0,Provider,You have those thoughts.
5001.0,Patient,"yeah it's, it is a it is. I think both becky and I in the therapy that we've helped like I think the therapies really helped us like even. On Tuesday, when we were in group or whatever right before group her and I gotta fight and like over something stupid, but I thought she hung up on me, but she was in my earpiece. And then, my assistant was sitting next to me and I was like a hellish fuckin hang up on me, but she hadn't hung up on me and so, then my assistant was like well that's rude and I was like I know and then so but here's a shit about me."
105.0,Provider,Oh no. Oh no all.
5001.0,Patient,Right good.
105.0,Provider,Oh yeah.
5001.0,Patient,"And I agree with you, and then I was like and so, then you know, but I will say right normally that would aspire all this out of control for a couple of days like right. So, then, I was like park leg, and then I got in group and about whole thing with a group, and then I she attacked me like hey that was rude. You know my sister has a crush on me and I know that, and so, then she's like that's rude to be like. Talking shit from your assistant, who are making it sound like we have flaws, or something you know, and I understood that so immediately just apologized neared what she said I apologized I took accountability, for my part and moved on."
105.0,Provider,How did you address that are you addressing that.
5001.0,Patient,The crush part she's not she's she's she said that I had to give I had we had to replace sounds like this is too much so. Her last days.
105.0,Provider,"What do you attribute to. What would be a label for what happened with turning to that assistant knowing she has a crush and saying oh that was rude now, how do you between you and I, how do you explain what that was."
5001.0,Patient,"You know I think is me like honestly so angie it drives me crazy anyways that's my assistant she. has always like we always used to say she's like single white female because she has some weird obsession with me that's weird like I don't know it's strange. But um I think I was just upset like I was like I had too much man, I was trying to join group with you guys I had another meeting. That was going on, on another computer so literally had to computers and my phone at two meetings and trying to join group. And becky happened to call at that time and I answered it and I just have broke like like that, like I can't play guys like I, like you know I can only handle so much like before I was like too much, but I just like the way that we were able to you know. fix it move on. yeah."
105.0,Provider,But what did you learn that. I can't handle I mean there's only.
5001.0,Patient,"Oh nevermind I thought becky was trying to get him to the room, but it's my dog. He knows how to open that. And so I think I learned for myself, though, that in that moment that I have like a I have a tendency to. Let my feelings and my emotions all sudden just come out overflow and like blurt out versus and that there's an appropriate there's an appropriate time and place for. friends and family and friends or family to say certain things and I sometimes don't have that filter and I know that about myself but i've been working on that a little bit more than usual. yeah so like because I know that there are times, where. i'm. Oh, my gosh can you hear my dog."
105.0,Provider,And now.
5001.0,Patient,"He can open the door of his nose. Oh yeah, then I was he doing. He can open his nose and he's a golden doodle and our handles are like this, you know and so he can do it this. Is smart and. yeah, so I think. I think. I know where we were but it's things that."
105.0,Provider,filter failure.
5001.0,Patient,"yeah so yeah I ever didn't see when I get overwhelmed I don't have a very good filter even with the kids even just in general, like I don't have a good like. stop talking. Good nervousness I just talked, no matter what anger talk like it's just like stop just stop. getting better but it's not always a good thing."
105.0,Provider,"Well, there was. Two computers phone becky and probably other things that she had booked at the same time or didn't have booked but that this all this stuff was going on."
5001.0,Patient,"Well yeah and my assistant sitting in my office i'm trying to join group she doesn't know that I. Have recovery problems or issues or whatever, she doesn't know that i'm trying to get her out of my office, it was just too much. She just chooses like sitting in my office would leave. And it get in a meeting and she's like oh i'm involved in all your meetings about this one girl. So she's just she's like I can do the meeting for you i'm like no like I need to be there, like it, because it's like you know it's hard to explain, you know it's like it's a doctrine. Thank you know."
105.0,Provider,"there's none of that stuff of just liking, having that attention with her."
5001.0,Patient,"um no, I find it annoying honestly like. Maybe it's flattering but i'm annoyed by or most days, she calls me nonstop it's insane that's part of the problem."
105.0,Provider,I do need to review some of your goals we've just make a quick statement at least about each one. I want to rebuild. yeah how's it doing.
5001.0,Patient,I think it's way better than it used to be honestly way better.
105.0,Provider,And how do you measure that.
5001.0,Patient,"i'm just one what's going on in my life like like you know what's happening and how i'm responding to it. So you know, like confidence like if i'm responding to things that happened in my life confidently then it, I know, like Okay, I must be doing well with that and the feeling inside of like okay used to be, it may be a five of believing in myself and now, maybe i'm at like a seven or eight."
105.0,Provider,"Oh OK, I see. Well that's very tangible. So let's see and really the objective here was just to identify the barriers to it, I think i'd like to close this particular objective doesn't mean we can't. write, one that still reflects the goal itself so if I want to rebuild. My confidence that's your goal your stated goal. what's left to do, or what continues to be a challenge in the rebuilding of it."
5001.0,Patient,"Then just maintaining and like maintaining that I. Like. Am who I am I have you know I am good not you know, like I. have the ability to I guess I don't know I guess it just like. reminding myself of the accomplishments over the last four years."
105.0,Provider,"So that's. that's a how and that's excellent. that's how you might continue right is to continue to remember your accomplishments that's what you can be doing on a regular basis, but let's just take a look at the goal itself is it still something you aspire to. have more confidence, a sort of a yes, no question, or is it done is it there."
5001.0,Patient,Is there.
105.0,Provider,"Okay, that might be a cool alright so. let's go to another one. I want to learn about the implications of staying on the buprenorphine as well as implications of tapering and tapering off."
5001.0,Patient,i'm going to taper off. So when I come back from Arizona my goal is to taper off and I I talked to the doctor and i'm done like this medication is such a. it's so hard you know and not that I don't love this program and not that I don't I mean honestly like wholeheartedly you guys have changed my life but and. Then I cannot this medication is so like with all the travel and as much as I have going on in my life I hate being tied to it. So I had talked to the doctor when I get back on the. On I think it's the 10th or may look real quick. yeah So when I get back on the 10th and the meeting on the 14th or the group on the 14th i'm I want to start tapering okay.
105.0,Provider,And you're at how many milligrams down.
5001.0,Patient,"One point something like. 1.5, I think, or something."
105.0,Provider,let's see what it's got a little record here. medication.
5001.0,Patient,1.2 million and.
105.0,Provider,"It says 1.5 prescribed on the 31st or something on the. Okay 1.5. So. that's not quite the same as what the goal is now because so let's look at it again, I wrote down what you said and I hear what your plan is. I want to learn about the implications of staying on it, as well as the implications of tapering and then tapering off so. If you were to say what is it that the specifically this buprenorphine and now, are you on suboxone. Okay, so what is it that it has been doing for you. This whole time for it."
5001.0,Patient,"Like it's a safety blanket honestly it's. kept me from going out it's suppressed any cravings that I may have had, and you know I don't know i've heard conflicting things, but I feel like for me personally it's been just that a safety blanket and that it keeps me from obviously going through withdrawal."
105.0,Provider,"Tell me more about. How has it been a safety blanket that's a metaphor right so. I get to a straw that's the chemical dependence part, so we might say that means I don't have withdrawal symptoms get that but how is it safety keeping."
5001.0,Patient,"It just is one of those things where if i'm having a bad day and it's a. Thought or if it's something like man that sounds good or oh my gosh then it's like what is then in the back of my head i'm like it doesn't make sense to do that because you're on suboxone so what would be the point you know, and I haven't had that in a long time, but it's like why. you're it gives you that time I guess that buffer to think about. Like to really process that like. Even if you tried to go get high like it wouldn't you can't because you're on suboxone."
105.0,Provider,What will you or place. You can't get high what will you replace that with if you do not have that safety blanket.
5001.0,Patient,"Now replace it with look at how far you've come, you know we sat you know for years and a beautiful life for to get high."
105.0,Provider,Are you forgetting how hard life can be it can feel pretty painful.
5001.0,Patient,"yeah no I can't no i'm, not forgetting it's there. And I think i'm going there more in the last month and I have a long time so. You know, so I think that and I. know I know."
105.0,Provider,"So you've got a thought Look how far i've come. And what do you do with the. Well let's take one give me give me a negative thought, maybe you've had recently what you did with it."
5001.0,Patient,"i'm gonna need a thought, but like with my family, I was very nervous like okay you're more comfortable with your high or you're you're funnier or you're free you're you know go let you know I wish I could do that, like in your head, you know in my head is. Within within seconds i'm like okay that's ridiculous."
105.0,Provider,And what is it about when you showed up anyway. What can What did you see yourself as so there's this i'm funnier freer you showed up.
5001.0,Patient,"And then. And then those able to have conversations as able to have my brain wasn't all sporadic all over the place. You know this is something that I was trying to explain to becky to recently, you know I have add and it's pretty bad sometimes, but when I was on. When I was on the. When I was taking pills, or when I was doing heroin, it was like my brain would calm down or like my I would feel like I could think straight almost again, it sounds crazy but and so. So I felt like it would just like calm the crazy and so, then it just so, then I think that sometimes they go oh my gosh. You know, come calm you down."
105.0,Provider,You remember noticing. The faces and reactions of people do you remember seeing their reactions to you. What. What you notice.
5001.0,Patient,"Who are nice and warm and like very like you know it was nice it was like proud, I guess, have preferred calm and like what's going on in my life and no not a lot of people in my family quite new maybe, but I think seeing the differences from when I used to be, to now. It seemed like people kind of I mean they said they're embarrassed rate, so they thought they won't say I was an addict they say like. Oh, she had a drinking problem or something so then but to see how well i've come like I think are far i've come I think people started like they felt good about it, I guess, I don't know."
105.0,Provider,"Our city with. face to face. that's a general one did it could be you didn't see anything, this is this has to do with that same condition you just talked about, which is the ADHD it's not uncommon for folks with that cluster of symptom to not be really paying attention to the people they're talking to their face. that's how we bounce back Oh, maybe i've been talking too long. Like We saw this is a really precise question Do you remember noticing someone's face."
5001.0,Patient,and moving soon.
105.0,Provider,So homework pay attention if you want to it's just one more skill it's naturally as missing from that same filter it's.
5001.0,Patient,"It would be nice to have that because. I because you know i've thought often to treat this ADHD like I thought I should maybe get on something or whatever, but I don't want to be on anything else and but he doesn't. she's not really you know we're not really support she's not really supportive of being on something and so i've tried but it's going it's very difficult. didn't try to explain it. And if she gets it like she says, sometimes it's sometimes I can control it sometimes I can but. I can't like sometimes it's just."
105.0,Provider,"You guys may decide down the line, to have an agreement, she may do some subtle thing like this say notice my face. Because you are reacting probably on some level right it's just you're nervous blah blah blah, but the key is, we can see someone's head turns away they're no longer looking at us, they need a break. Right, the not something rude it's just we notice, maybe you don't it's a great feedback loop to go oh. hey me check in to see what i've been talking about just being absorbed give them a chance for feedback show them that you care about how they're receiving information so a nice way is to look at face."
5001.0,Patient,"And then, what about so that the weather on the opposite end where so. Like I don't mean to be dismissive towards people and I don't mean to not listen or taking what they're saying, but sometimes it's so hard when they're just talking talking in like it just there's so much going on, like do you have any suggestions on how I can better. yeah like like my sister in law, I guess, apparently, has a big problem with me with the fact that, like i'm very dismissive towards but you know i've heard that."
105.0,Provider,"Remember, we talked about the voice."
5001.0,Patient,mm hmm oh. Buddha them like what it when I.
105.0,Provider,"made it you made you, you want me to control these people i've never met. You want me to do something with them."
5001.0,Patient,I want you to tell me how I can. Better like react to them or whatever I don't know i'm so like i'm just.
105.0,Provider,"I don't know you could say. it's not this complicated you go back to just the truth, I don't say anything fancy first of all, you got all the skills, you need. And the stuff you're doing right now oh Sarah Jane. I want to take in what you're saying. I want to go back to this first part and not lose what you had said earlier. What was that again, you said when we first went in here, and you were talking about this. or. You know, whatever the truth is, I want to, I want to talk about that thing you said earlier, I want to talk, I want to hear everything you said. I don't remember the last part of been just sort of preoccupied with the first part, you said, whatever the truth is something wrong with it right, but that shows an interest, it shows you can only kind of process so much at a time I don't know what's going on with you. I don't know what the truth is what's the truth, do you really not give a shit about what you say. i'm just curious. Maybe she boring do maybe you really don't."
5001.0,Patient,"I mean half the things people say I don't really. I mean you know i'm not trying to be rude and I know it comes out rude. I care sometimes what people think, but. I mean I don't know. Maybe, so I don't I wish you know it goes back to the whole empathy thing I wish I had more of. A way of like being. Not rude or not like like just. I don't know and I guess again change myself, but I wish I did have a longer attention span so then maybe I could take in what people were saying, or, if I can be. nicer."
105.0,Provider,"So it doesn't look like content aside the contents a little draw people's lives are really not all that interesting sometimes but you do want. Whatever this audience is to not be pulled by you pissed off by you agitated by you. pushed away from you, you want them sort of if I could say approximately you don't want them to go away just fine no complaints just that no negative response from this interactions communication neutral okay well. yeah then that's those social skills right just being able to. Have empathy maybe yeah caring about."
5001.0,Patient,"something you don't have man, I really wish I could have empathy I do i'm around."
105.0,Provider,"All all this is is it's taking your experience and you drop it in to someone else's and taking there and bring it to you, so if you say. Do you really think you're that interesting all the time, I know all the times the acceleration Jay you really think you're fat interesting is your life so interesting. Have you ever found like you're talking about a story and even you lost interest in it. Okay. yeah I mean, so you know it's. This is about two human beings wanting. To have this other person find them. interesting. We want to. So give it to her the hearse the hymns. By asking some questions if you can send some questions. You already know how to do this. Get let's see if there's an example out there we're done reviewing goals and we can come up with more which might have to do with empathy is that something you want to work on."
5001.0,Patient,"Or it is, it is Sunday or on. A genuinely there are things it's funny to certain things will catch my heart right and i'm like oh like that got me but there's other times, where i'm like. Not compassionate and not I don't have that and I want to have it and I don't know if that's something that you can learn I don't know if it's something you know, some people clearly have it. Some people don't but a big goal, right now, I think, for me is that i've been noticing it's my add seems to be running rampant when I have lots of things going on in my life. It seems to get a little I don't want to see out of control, but I have a really hard time focusing on like becky and what she's asking or like you know, like. Like she. it's like simple she only wants a few minutes of my time for me to really listen, but those few minutes seemed like forever and it's hard sometimes to just focus on that."
105.0,Provider,"Okay, so. you'd have described the problem it helps if. You can identify what your goal is see if you can say I want this I want."
5001.0,Patient,I wanna come up with tools. to remind myself to stop and pay attention.
105.0,Provider,Sorry i'm. Go to I want to increase skill of empathy I want to come up with tools to stop and pay attention.
5001.0,Patient,mm hmm.
105.0,Provider,alright. So let's take. Which one you want to focus on. today.
5001.0,Patient,"Would you say today. Now I don't really know, I think the biggest thing for me right now is that. Like life is going really well and i'm putting into play all the things i've learned with you and, like its life is really for me it's going pretty well you know I mean there's nothing crazy and. being happy with that, but then kind of pushing myself outside of. You and we get content. Is stop. Working and then we fall backwards, so I just want to keep like progressing forward. Does that make sense, yes. And he will."
105.0,Provider,tell you where I think you should progress which I don't tend to do.
5001.0,Patient,"No, I want to. I do."
105.0,Provider,"My next step, what was going to be, but I won't do that you gotta tell me. hi just do this so one of the key pieces with addressing symptoms and just because ADHD is. Quick it's a quick terminology, but just so you know. It is you might think of it as a. learning disability of executive functioning. So I don't really think you know I get a little annoyed sometimes with ADHD but because of the ease of how easy it is to say that for communication just going to use that but just know that i'm more conceptualize it as. Just. You know, organic brain tissue development and meeting skills and I just I just don't land it just diagnoses I don't tend to just land there I see it as a cluster of symptoms but anyway so just for ease of communication so. You. have been able to accomplish and just just listen to the question and see if you can really just investigate you have been able to stay attentive and focused here with me. How did you do it hold on don't answer just think do research into your own mind how this is a how question you would did accomplish it. should come up with the things that you did, how you got here on time how you. stay focused you did didn't get up and walk around you, you did a lot of things to come across attentive and focused so it's a how questions and it's a very deliberate one how did you do it today, you did certain things to make that possible to know what you did."
5001.0,Patient,"yeah well I do I know. I know that I. keep reminding myself it's rude to be fidgety it's rude to not look at you it's hard to not like try to listen. they'll ask me anything we really talked about today, but I try like you know because that's like. Like. With even with the dog like at the door, you know it's like but I Q just reminded me so it's rude listen. pay attention focus."
105.0,Provider,"Now that's a significant thing that. Think, the key here is we look for evidence that indeed, you have the skill right, you have it. and being able to say it's rude to fidget and then, whatever else. to know. I don't know, maybe he didn't say it so i'm afraid to say anything else, but instead, what you said was I listened and focused and listened and kept saying is it saying to yourself again it's the how. that's what i'm trying to do."
5001.0,Patient,"Just it's well there's. I mean, I have, I know what. what's the word i'm looking for like basic manners if I you know I. sit and listen that's rude not to listen, like. get the most out of this hour so like let's sit and do this this, and this, or whatever you know, like I get it there's basically when you. stand in front of someone and you shake their hand you shake their hand and then you look them in the eye and like I get it it's like this checklist of. You do these things, because that's the appropriate thing to do, and then it's when you're looking at them and talking to them and discussing it, and then it's it's past that so it's like the step five to get out one to five, but then after five i'm just like. Like you know."
105.0,Provider,An ad we're getting somewhere in those I don't know I know it seems like I should but I don't you actually have a checklist of some sort of social etiquette. In which there's you don't fidget you sit look them in the eye and. I listen and focus.
5001.0,Patient,"yeah like you know if you're talking to someone and meeting someone you you shake their hand and look them in the eye you, you know you introduce yourself whatever. And then you sit and then that's and then you try to make conversation or whatever it is, but it's like that that after part where then whatever conversation I just brought up or talk to her meetup or whatever it's that next step after that, where i'm gone by, that okay."
105.0,Provider,"stay there. So i've got it i've got it. It is let's say you have memorize some. yeah, this is what we'll talk about i'll get the conversation started and you get there, and now this person's mouth is moving. and your oh. Oh."
5001.0,Patient,"Sick uncomfortable awkward and that feeling come over me of like uncomfortable and awkward. I think that's why I struggle to to make, I have a lot of friends is very interesting, I have a lot of like. friends or acquaintances but I don't feel like i'm deep connections with most of these people."
105.0,Provider,"let's it might be useful to because I I might be able to experience something therapeutically if I have a sense of. When you're with me here. Do you feel awkward and uncomfortable did you this morning, are you right now."
5001.0,Patient,"No. it's that moments in between where like it's the moments in between where so you meet someone you talk to them, and this is where it goes back to the confidence part for me is. I think the one through five, I know I have down, and I can come across. Intelligent well put together, whatever you know the the things so it's after that then trying to carry on a conversation I become intimidated awkward and uncomfortable and then shut down or walk away. And before, when I was on drugs it didn't really matter right because I was just like free and like didn't didn't have to overthink was what to say or was that the right way to say it, or was that the right word to use or shoot I should have said this, or you know I mean it's like. it's very anxiety, it gives me a lot of anxiety."
105.0,Provider,first thing. everybody feels that. Did you know that.
5001.0,Patient,Iran kills that.
105.0,Provider,"I know Okay, but but let that in let it in. They do. Again we go back to nothing's missing with you. there's nothing missing that awkward. Right and that that is a his. way, deep down, like that we all kind of wonder what to say next when it doesn't flow, sometimes it doesn't flow you default to some sort of deficit in you. Whether it's confidence empathy. Is this my ADHD you you come back to this. You are not wholly responsible for this right. This just may not interest you may not be interesting. or this person dropped the ball this person's anxiety they didn't ask you a question. But underneath all of that. it's Okay, we all feel it, they all feel it. there's nothing wrong and missing and you. just sit there with that for just a second okay that's a baseline fundamental piece. That might need a real just pull it out that it's okay that you're like well huh. What else is going on, you know as in. It can lighten it up there's no shame there's no blame it's just we ran out of things to talk about like Oh, I guess we're both kind of sitting here stymied we don't know what to say to each other and it just it hit a wall it's not something missing in you."
5001.0,Patient,So for the goods.
105.0,Provider,"I know that's why I brought it up it's why number one. Number One. Because you keep i'm right I shut down i'm intimidated it's getting worse, we all want that flow everybody wants that flow can have it all time everybody. And you take so much pride in this ability to write to sell be this this way of being with other people, but. Sometimes it doesn't flow and it's got nothing to do with your skills okay so just let that in I I know you think it is like way, deep down it's not that happens to everybody, it just get stuck for an endless number of reasons that just an exhaustive list we can't cover today. Sometimes you know you're tired you're bored you really don't want to be there, your brain just took a shit and you forgot something to say I don't know it could be anything. Sometimes it's them but it's baseline it's not because of some fundamental flaw in you. So. that's the given that milk may take time for you to embrace that sometimes we're going to meet people and it's going to be awkward it's going to suck but the suck image can be less if we say. guess, we ran out of stuff to talk about real quick in your head or maybe someday."
5001.0,Patient,out loud out loud.
105.0,Provider,"Fine Joel Of course you don't have to I can get away with a lot, because since humor but in your head at least you can say it well, that kind of fizzled out quickly. Any right and then you're like well, I guess, I don't have another you know appetizer some you want anything from over here the layer that yeah the layer you have is. it's quiet. awkward intimidated, they seem to know what they can keep it going, why can I keep it going."
5001.0,Patient,Now.
105.0,Provider,"That layers the one that we can take off. Go back to. listen to what they're saying use the stuff you've already been doing. And either ask a question to investigate more and be curious about it, something about if you're really listening see what I don't know if it's what's happening is the all these mechanics are being used like. Oh, my God what's there so fucking step six with the Fuck am I supposed to say right now versus listening to what this character is saying. Some piece of it in some little feather relevance of connection may come back to something that interests, you really listening versus a structured step. might be useful to have a piece of content on this one. Do you have anything where you are like. I want to make a good impression I don't know what to do right now feel awkward kind of wish I could get high I wouldn't even notice this, I would just be yakking away like I don't know we have anything for that came up."
5001.0,Patient,"yeah I mean that's. With like in general that's How was the whole so the whole celebration of life, every time someone come over and talk in this awkward leg. And then, then you know I always overcompensate with things and I hate that like you know, like Oh, but he knows, but hacer oh back and I didn't like or overdone that like versus. To stop and listen to what they're saying and pay attention and like taken what the whatever it is, I I need to learn that I don't need to overcompensate to make myself look better or that I don't need to."
105.0,Provider,"I suspect, I hear what you're saying I hear what you're saying, but what I wonder is really if the work that you and I can do in this can be something you practice is. sitting with silence I just did it to you and I bet you didn't even like that just now."
5001.0,Patient,No it's so awkward.
105.0,Provider,I know. But.
5001.0,Patient,yeah.
105.0,Provider,You won't believe what will happen. When you can sit with it your timeframe is so skewed. Right your brain moves. extremely fast. Now that's lucky for you. You can take for granted that. Even when you feel like it's snails slow just slow slow the rest of us can tolerate a great deal more. Time in between.
5001.0,Patient,"Statement yeah yeah I know it's funny because. You know, like becky says a lot, where she needs silence to decompress she needs or she needs that pause between conversation to think it through you know but i'm already on like i'm already way past that."
105.0,Provider,Music needs. space between the notes for TV music.
5001.0,Patient,Oh sure yeah.
105.0,Provider,said it.
5001.0,Patient,yeah and you sense okay well you know you're making sense when I get it hang on it that's funny.
105.0,Provider,Like that metaphor i've had that one for about 20 years.
5001.0,Patient,i've never heard is very good. make sense it clicks with me.
105.0,Provider,"Right so um. You know, find your way, one of them is."
5001.0,Patient,Taking the taking the.
105.0,Provider,"Taking one breath in through the nose out through the mouth there's plenty of groups i've done one where someone says, do not and we just practice. boy that that's a strong, you know you have a strong feeling about that. gives us some time to think about it. So. We breathe, we make a you can memorize like you, you know you'd like to have some structure, you know we have this little phrase that we might say boy, and then we breathe, and then we say a non committal statement. i'm going to give that some thought. Though so there's lots to do. But philosophically if you. Can not accept. That this is a relational event. It takes these two people, it is not a skills deficit of yours, you are not broken, remember, we started today with hey i'm not well, you might still think so."
5001.0,Patient,Good now broken.
105.0,Provider,"And you're not broken, we can all benefit from. from learning more. You know, but it doesn't mean that you're broken. So yeah good um. So I want to just review a little bit that question I asked is not a small one, when I said it, how. Did you accomplish the success in an exchange with someone that you are satisfied with or you liked the facial response from someone is. Your best resource you investigate your own way that you've already cultivated hmm let's say you were you know you call yourself impulsive. I just blurt out whatever i'm just have a big old mouth I just say were several months wow wait a second let's see if that's true hey I remember last week, I was at this meeting, and I was like I wanted to speak. Oh, my gosh I wanted to talk, but I didn't how did I do that look at your own how you did it. And you were lovely today, you were able to identify a lot I kept saying you know. Through its route to fidget I paid attention to my body, maybe a one point you moved it into a rocking and I don't know what else we're doing with your body that you were doing things you. Are your best resource the answers are there it's just we've gotta just kind of investigate moments when it worked you do know how just playing a time you stay quiet. And you listened, because it was some value in it like I better listen to this because they're they have information that I don't have I gotta listen to this. or I won't be able to make an educated statement I got to hear what they're going to say you're doing it and we just got to find where that is. Okay you're doing it. All right, what do you want to meet again."
5001.0,Patient,"So i'm. i'm in Arizona until the 10th, but I can meet in I can meet anytime i'm going i'm open."
105.0,Provider,i'm taking I think all upright heart really even the electronic health record has taken a vacation on Monday.
5001.0,Patient,Oh good yay.
105.0,Provider,"Oh, I. Like but the record minute we're not even open the computer web based like if you close like what anyway so good thing yeah all the docs decided we don't want to have group i'm like okay fine that I won't look any plan to. So lightening up a little bit next week and everything's kind of booked up doesn't mean there won't be a no shot but. i'm. It looks like it. It looks like if you could do Sep tember it's a Tuesday, though September 14 at eight."
5001.0,Patient,"Oh so well so i've been trying to do that group now which, until we get you know so then it's been until my life comes down a little bit, and I do group on the 14th. Tuesday, but. i'll be back though so i'll be hopefully on the 14th my life will be back to somewhat normal."
105.0,Provider,you'll be in new Mexico.
5001.0,Patient,"On the 14th yes, I did yeah. I better now yeah."
105.0,Provider,"So if you want you could do that 8am and then you could talk to you, you want to go Thursday or Friday I think they want to know moving forward, where you're going to be, but I I can't keep track of my caseload about where people are in their."
5001.0,Patient,"Groups you guys were. So I don't mind this is the thing and I don't mind doing route on Fridays that's actually the best group, for me, the issue is is the prescription gets all wonky. And then it becomes very convoluted and frustrating and hard so because she's been writing the week week, and so, if I go on the Seventh, which I have written down for me to go. To Group then she'll give me seven days which will only take me to the 14 so, but if she doesn't and she does it till the 17th and I can do. Tuesday and go to grow so."
105.0,Provider,"Small I can't she's not here. But both of you have to work at this you've watched probably she will just get that. yeah that doesn't always work, so we have to say, Dr gabrielle. Okay, transferring my group to Friday the seven teeth. You know, when we calculate the number of days, how many days are you prescribing for what do you have. Is it and you Kevin number you don't say what is it tell her is this many days will I get me through the 17th. forced to look."
5001.0,Patient,Perfect so good so let's do the 14th then.
105.0,Provider,"Okay, am."
5001.0,Patient,desert yeah.
105.0,Provider,"write yourself a note to remember that this prescription is going to take some attention, or it."
5001.0,Patient,So well yeah i'll make i'll bring it up and say like this is the date and then i'll start doing the groups on the Fridays because that makes it way easier for me. Great earlier 14th or time.
105.0,Provider,"8am and then your group will be on 11am. On Fridays Fridays, so now that leaves no backup just so you know right it just does."
5001.0,Patient,It snow yeah it's fine.
105.0,Provider,Okay.
5001.0,Patient,"All right, what."
105.0,Provider,Do you want to say. Do you need anything right now. No okay.
5001.0,Patient,everything's good.
105.0,Provider,"Okay, be an investigator of the how how did I just do that oh my gosh I wanted to say 20 things to this guy I didn't how did I do, that being an investigator and come back and tell me."
5001.0,Patient,sounds good.
