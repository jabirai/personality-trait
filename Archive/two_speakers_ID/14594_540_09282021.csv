Alright, for transcription I was just messaging my supervisor and then voice at virtual clinic again so police are on their way and they're gonna let or contact me with any update. But. She should be i'm guessing sleeping by the time that they get there, so I don't know if they're gonna take her to the hospital or anything. um. Other than that. I don't think anything for transcription. Thank you."
