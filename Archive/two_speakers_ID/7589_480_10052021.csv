480.0,Provider,On her.
7589.0,Patient,"yeah and literally, the only thing that kept me from knocking her on her ass right, then, and there was that might stand in between us. So I mean. it's it's settled down since our you know hasn't been as bad, but."
480.0,Provider,She running her mouth about.
7589.0,Patient,"How What did she say. Trying to remember. Oh um okay so. I don't know if I told you i'm Dave been bring it my mom's cat got hit by a car. And died, and so they got a new kitten. And for some reason they've been bringing the car over when they come over for dinner. And, like all it does is Tara shit. right because they let it do whatever he wants, you know when it when they're home because they don't you know they don't care, like my mom's house is. i'll just be honest my house mom's house is trashy like we have not lived in like a completely cluttered house with like clothes everywhere and piles and you know I mean like it just. moms are very clean perfect. yeah when it comes to comes through a house. Like I don't understand why everything else for high ratings wine and shit but it's like she does not clean up the House at all. And I mean i'm not being like. exaggerate right now, like it. I don't know how the hell she doesn't have her shoes. Like. it's not bad and. Well, you know they bring the cat over and it like gets in my aunt's plants and auction over and just creating more messages for her tearing up who knew last chairs and i'm like you know. Like real respectful. I mean i'm sure she doesn't care that you bring the cat over but don't let it tear up her fucking house. League and it just you know it got to me, finally, and she. I think she was staying all night is what it was. And she was sitting there irritating my and about who can frank stay with me can frank stay with me blah blah blah talking about the cat. man said no, several times. Well, and she wanted to get shitty about it so i've freaked out on her and screamed like as loud, as I could like she doesn't want the cat here in the fucking story. I like period. And all yeah then it turned in to her runner my back and I. was ready to plant her on her ass play League, I mean that was just all those to it, I just. I was writing."
480.0,Provider,So what do you think is most triggering for you about that you think it's the disrespect.
7589.0,Patient,"Oh absolutely yes. Because I mean. I know i'm not the greatest person I am but I sure as hell don't sit here and tear up the House. You know, like maybe once upon a time I have, so I don't really have room to talk, but."
480.0,Provider,"Well, you can't say that because you still. Like even if you've made mistakes in the past, you can still have standards and expectations for how people are going to be hey."
7589.0,Patient,"You know, so I mean like it says, you know different time now and I I just I can't stand the show like nobody's going to talk to my hand that way in front of me for one and talk to my mom that way in front of me like period. And I. Care who you are I don't care if you're fucking seven foot 300 fucking 400 pounds I won't stand for, I will say something yeah. Well, I like I have before when it came to somebody being disrespectful and I sure as hell not gonna stop now like, I mean i've been literally face to chest with somebody you know I mean much bigger than me over being disrespectful i'm not scared of anybody. Playing. When I say like that happens, my. Common sense goes out the fucking door."
480.0,Provider,Like well that's what it sounds like it's totally a ptsd trigger for you so i'm wondering like what is. This correlated to in your past as far as disrespect or someone disrespecting you.
7589.0,Patient,"are probably still goes back to being bullied. yeah I mean even. I mean not always did I stand up for myself, but you know I guess. When I do for either myself or for somebody else it seems to fly out, you know. With with no control almost like I don't want to say quite like a blackout, because I used to have lockouts when I get pissed and they were a lot different than like what it out, because, like before, when I used to get my like in school and stuff I wouldn't be able to remember what happened."
480.0,Provider,really interesting you like totally dissociated.
7589.0,Patient,"Literally like totally see read like like i'm gonna fucking murder you and there's not sure you can do about it, like. yeah walk out. yeah and you know, usually wouldn't stop unless I like snapped out of it."
480.0,Provider,"Right yeah because what's happening is your brains getting pushed into the survival mode so fight flight freeze. So your thing is fight, obviously."
7589.0,Patient,"So I mean you know, like I said it's a lot better now I have obviously calm down a lot. But I mean I do get pushed pretty close sometimes but I mean like I said any disrespect whatsoever towards my as like an instant. Like snapping thing. I mean it it's an uncontrollable like."
480.0,Provider,she's your family that makes sense. Because you're going to be protective over her the most because she's your closest family member.
7589.0,Patient,"So I mean it just. I don't know we've been trying to Connor. talk a little bit more, because neither one of us slave really open up about our feelings like how you know I mean we truly feel. We kind of I guess talked a little bit cuz she's been down about shit i've obviously been down in Russia. And we kind of I mean we didn't really like get into it like well I guess once emotions started showing then like dot one it kind of quit you know what off, but like we were talking about. Now i'm talking about she's always running like everybody always has that woman doing something like fully including me. And like we're talking about. My cousin he doesn't come around and he doesn't he doesn't even color."
480.0,Provider,And that's her son.
7589.0,Patient,"yeah yeah and. You know, it really bothers her. She like was talking to me about she's like you know I don't know what to do, do I try harder or do I give him this distance or you know, and I was like whoa I mean I honestly don't know because Todd is a fucking mama's boy. Like."

She said something about joking around and he took it as an insult and started sharper now remind you i'm 16 she's like 13 or 14 at the time. Like Todd Lee calm down like she was just joking.

7589.0,Patient,"You know I mean, but with the bypass like they literally bypass your stomach with your esophagus in your intestine but they're leaving your stomach and."
480.0,Provider,"So then, what does your stomach do once it's in it's just."

480.0,Provider,I know people who have done this leave it's just gonna take me a minute to think of hill.
7589.0,Patient,"i've had several people tell me like I feel like people go for the bypass because you're able to lose more weight. doing the bow. Okay, like 50 to 75 pound difference with the sleeve, and the bypass."

7589.0,Patient,yeah toy till you heal.
480.0,Provider,wow.
7589.0,Patient,So it's it's she said it's anywhere from a 16 week shilling process for either.
480.0,Provider,For both so for both it would be similar recovery as far as liquids for a while and then like slowly start to build up to eating real food.
7589.0,Patient,I mean either way like it still scares me cuz I mean. They can't do it i'm laparoscopically.
480.0,Provider,I have to actually do an incision.
7589.0,Patient,"yeah yeah so that's one thing that's got me a little on edge about it i'm going to make a decision, I don't have to make a decision, and so they go to schedule a surgery and that's not for a couple more months. Trying to quit smoking has just been. Like I haven't even gotten to my doctor to get on the Channel because i'm just. i'm just not ready yet. Oh, I gotta get ready real quick."
480.0,Provider,"Well, and that's one honestly like quitting smoking it's almost like you have to be done emotionally way before you put them down physically."
7589.0,Patient,"And that's been one of my I mean that's been a bigger coping coping skills, then pokemon house or anything else that i've you know."
480.0,Provider,Do you use dates.
7589.0,Patient,Only use the vapor for marijuana.
480.0,Provider,"trick it to be effective, for you are now."
7589.0,Patient,Every time i've tried to do the next Tina makes me.
480.0,Provider,"Show. that's a good way to quit because you can get like lower percentages of nicotine, so you can like wean yourself down."
7589.0,Patient,"And my whole thing was going to be, you know or i'm quitting so like maybe you know I can pick up a little bit on the week to kind of replace that you know of smoking still I get used to not having my cigarettes. Oh, then the darker I don't think I got to tell you this one, then the nutritionist lady wanted to come back with well you gotta quit smoking weed to."
480.0,Provider,Like. Have the surgery unless you quit. Oh no. i'm. Sorry that's the.
7589.0,Patient,"Number one thing that's been helping my back so much lately. and yeah yeah I. I really I don't know I don't know if it's like you know opinion thing. or not. She tried to tell me that I can't do any thc. Not even like edibles or like tinctures or anything along those lines, and no CBD which doesn't make any sense to me because you can't test for CBD. Like."
480.0,Provider,"Well, did she give you a reason why is it because of anesthesia Is it because."
7589.0,Patient,"My insurance won't cover the surgery if there's truth to my system, well, I brought it up to my pain clinic nurse, I was like, so I will question I was like. You know I know obviously you guys do a lot of surgeries like way more in depth than the bariatric to think, have you ever heard. of somebody getting turned down for surgery like either by you guys the doctor himself or an insurance company for having thc in your system and she's like absolutely not sure they're gonna ever heard of that in my entire life and she recommended that I call my insurance company. Just shoving."
480.0,Provider,It is not something that I like I know insurance has tried to do that with smoking and stuff like oh i'm not going to cover this if you still smoke.
7589.0,Patient,"I can see, but she's trying to tell me, even if I get my weed card. That it can't be in my system that my insurance will turn me down."
480.0,Provider,yeah it doesn't make a lot of sense.
7589.0,Patient,"It doesn't make any sense to me, but unfortunately and i've talked to this about. To a couple people and they agreed with me mount Carmel is like a religious hospital. So, like that's where I can kind of see it stemming from you know they don't agree with certain things so they're gonna tell you, otherwise. experienced that before with doctors so wouldn't surprise me if that's what they're trying to do. So I don't know I don't know for sure, because I don't want a chance to call my insurance, but."
480.0,Provider,The problem is to get it out of your system it's. Like 45 days right i'm not smoking.
7589.0,Patient,"And it's been. I mean. i've been soaking. probation. And it's been almost two years now, so i'm like. Oh."
480.0,Provider,No.
7589.0,Patient,i'm just gonna.
480.0,Provider,really hope you don't have to quit because I know how much it helps you.
7589.0,Patient,don't either like I literally started bawling in the office and i'm like dude every single time I find something that helps just a little bit Vegas drag out from underneath me like oh you can't do this anymore. I.
480.0,Provider,news is they're not saying you can't do it ever get you just might have to quit temporarily to get ready for the surgery. But it would be doable.
7589.0,Patient,"So I mean we're not. too worried about it i'm more worried about the smoking cigarettes, that I am just smoking weed but."
480.0,Provider,harder to quit than any other drug I swear to God.
7589.0,Patient,"i'm calling you, I have never had this much trouble trying to quit some like anything else i've done, you know, besides one I obviously got in trouble than I wanted to be rebellious about it. But you know any other time that i've tried to quit smoking i've just literally like quit like that, like, I, like me and my friend were literally topping kegs every night of alcohol and I just got more to that one day and was like Oh well, i'm done. It just."
480.0,Provider,I think process.
7589.0,Patient,"Was shit really easily, and I think that's why I can quit things so easily, and I feel like that's why I experiment with Charles a lot."
480.0,Provider,If you need to.
7589.0,Patient,"Get bored ish it like very, very quick. You know I i've done. i've been on several kicks where i've done nope for months and months and months, and then oh my God well i'm done and then never touch it again never talked to any of those people again."
480.0,Provider,In the addiction world.
7589.0,Patient,"So we're going to show you how you know, like it just kind of. It goes back and forth."
480.0,Provider,Have you asked yourself about chantix.
7589.0,Patient,um I was gonna go through my family doctor because I I don't think she wants me to get on xanax but i'm honestly i'm not gonna be able to do it cold Turkey.
480.0,Provider,Did you ask her about it.
7589.0,Patient,"I did she. i'm trying to remember how exactly her response was because it wasn't like. Like rude or anything but she. said that, like the type of medicine that is. She didn't think like i'd be. I don't know. Like she has basically said that she didn't think I should do the Channel she's thought that I should either do the patches the GM or hold. On I was kind of like well you know i've never had a problem with the suboxone other than i'm still on it. Right, where I would have.
