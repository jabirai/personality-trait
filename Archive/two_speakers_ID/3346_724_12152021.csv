I generally my sleep pattern is pretty I don't know I go to sleep pretty late early in the morning. And I generally wake up. You know, in time, to make it to work so. it's kind of difficult because I only have I can't see you on Fridays because that's what my group is, and I really realistically only have one day that I can. See you and that's Saturday."
724.0,Provider,mm hmm.
3346.0,Patient,yeah that's part of the problem.

Literally since adolescence and. there's been several occasions in my life, where I I tried sleep medication. They. It doesn't end well just just like causes irritability or depression or you know. You can't you can't take sleep medications."
724.0,Provider,What what meds have you tried grant as far as for sleep.
3346.0,Patient,it's hard to keep track of all of them.
724.0,Provider,Like track down or melatonin any of those. Either those okay.
3346.0,Patient,"Because it on take melatonin melatonin just makes me. it's hard for me to operate the next day I just feel lethargic and shitty so. But yeah tries to down melatonin ambien. or. yeah I can't remember a lot of the names of them, but."

3346.0,Patient,"No i'm. stressed out, but other than that I think i'm handling everything pretty well."
724.0,Provider,What all a stressed out about.
3346.0,Patient,"i'm worried about the arthritis that my doctor told me is developing the pain that's. probably never going to go away. Being in this program and having to worry about being discharged and the medication that. i'm on it's really hit or miss sometimes it works, sometimes it doesn't depending on my level of pain."
724.0,Provider,mm hmm.
3346.0,Patient,"And it's not like I can just call up shauntel and tell her you know it's like it. I leave a message with virtual clinic and I hear back within three days you know. So and it's not like I can take. two or more of my pain medication, at a time it's like a set dose and. I don't really know how to handle that um. yeah i'm. Having to move all this stuff and the deadlines like getting things out of the storage unit finances. they've. Like I said when the slow season so i've been getting sent home early quite a bit. and definitely and then quite a bit of debt. And was dealing with my own stuff while trying to help my mother. So mom."
724.0,Provider,Do you have anybody that can help with the moves since so that that would take some of that stress off.
3346.0,Patient,"my brother is supposed to be here to help, but he doesn't. know. loves him but he's. yeah."
724.0,Provider,"yeah, and I mean, is it anything you know mom can you and mom can both kind of reinforce that that would be helpful for. him to. Help out."
3346.0,Patient,"she's pretty pretty passive. yeah non-confrontational. it's definitely irritating a key. quit his job truck driving to come back and help and. When he wasn't working It is like. impossible to get them to do anything. Now he is working, he has helped my mom financially quite a bit. You know. it's just been like me trying to manage all this other shit well cleaning up after him."
724.0,Provider,"yeah do you guys have a very good relationship, you and your brother."
3346.0,Patient,"it's all right um it's been worse in the past, so i'm grateful for where it's at now."
724.0,Provider,"mm hmm. Like you feel like you, you guys can come up with a plan to get things moved and take some of that stress off both of you and your mom."
3346.0,Patient,"um. Honestly i'm i'm on the tail end of it and. there's not really working out a plan with him isn't really feasible like. Several weeks ago. I decided to do a little I don't know social experiment, where I brought three carloads worth the things from the storage unit and ice. and transported them all, like we're talking furniture boxes of pictures boxes of books. All sorts of stuff and I I brought it all from the car three different loads and while the truck and they filled up our living room with it."
724.0,Provider,and
3346.0,Patient,He had entire week off and then I left it there.
724.0,Provider,Just to see.
3346.0,Patient,"It move it and nothing moved for an entire week week and a half, when I asked him if he would help on his downtime. On my way to work one day. I came back and nothing and moved next, and I think it moves, so I got home from work one night and I just dealt with all that and put it all away. yeah."
724.0,Provider,Was there a reason he didn't do it or help out did he explain it or.
3346.0,Patient,No. No um. And like I said we've had issues in the past and. i'm just grateful for not having a tense relationship with them.
724.0,Provider,mm hmm.
3346.0,Patient,"So I don't really try to push them at all, because I know where it ends up. So. I just let him be as lazy as he wants, regardless of how much it frustrates me. yeah there's definitely been times, where. Take a clean the kitchen completely I do all the dishes, then I go back to my room and I come back out later that later that night like two in the morning. It doesn't make sense, how he can create so many dishes within a two hour period, you know. But. he's kind of gotten better about that, I think he hears me yelling profanities at two in the morning for having the claim of the show so."
724.0,Provider,"Well, it sounds like if you're just trying to let things blow off, you know and blow over and mom's doing the same he's not really learning that he needs to be accountable or step up."
3346.0,Patient,"Well he's 36 years old, you know if he hasn't learned now i'm not going to be the one to teach him it's going to end in a fistfight so and I don't want to do that. So."
724.0,Provider,yeah.
3346.0,Patient,"i've done my whole life, and I know it's not. I can't give him any direction."
724.0,Provider,"mm hmm. yeah does he does he get that way with mom as well, like aggressive with her, you know she would tell him to help out a little bit more."
3346.0,Patient,um. No definitely definitely heard him for us towards my mother before but. yeah. It doesn't last very long.
724.0,Provider,So what are some things that you want to work on specifically grant as far as with our sessions.
3346.0,Patient,are no man scheduling. Oh no.
724.0,Provider,"I mean the other, the other thought I had to is I mean do you want to try to find another provider that doesn't have you know. You know that just has medication management or you know therapy and not have to do the groups and everything and keep all the appointments. I mean, I know this this program requires a lot, and so I know some people, it is a challenge to keep up with everything, and so they explore other treatment options as well. So I didn't know if that was something that you feel like that you know, is something to think about or explore if that would be a better fit."
3346.0,Patient,You have thought about it and it sounds like it will be a lot less stressful but.
724.0,Provider,"I mean we certainly don't want to cause more stress, because that defeats the purpose of therapy."
3346.0,Patient,"mm hmm no I agree. yeah i'm not sure. I mean, I make I make my groups and I enjoy the groups and. I don't know. I think the groups are different because it's a set time every week. You know don't. don't have to worry about remembering something or. Creating a time space or something."
724.0,Provider,How do you keep track of your appointments now do you have them like on your phone with like reminders or on a calendar like written somewhere and you're.
3346.0,Patient,on the phone with reminders alarm so.
724.0,Provider,"Okay okay. I know, so what what gets in the way with that. Like is it just shutting off though alarms and then forgetting or."
3346.0,Patient,um yeah i'm not sure. i'm. or just sleeping through them.
724.0,Provider,"How many days a week, are you supposed to be going for physical therapy."
3346.0,Patient,"Two days a week. Okay yeah definitely so. um. They just recently started scheduling me for my days off from work and, like I said, my works been really flexible with me. It was really easy to make those appointments because i'd have to like. Make sure that I left work at a certain time to get there, I mean i've missed several because have gotten busy in the kitchen and not. Not remembered to take the time off, but now that it's on my days off they pretty much that's on every time. I don't know why."
724.0,Provider,"He. What is there other options, I mean do you have another doctor that could do your medications or."
3346.0,Patient,"No, I don't have a primary care physician now. that's another. i've made appointments to see them. Three times."
724.0,Provider,Okay yeah it's gonna say it's probably important that you have at least a primary care doctor to fall back on just your you know medical issues or if you get sick or anything like that.
3346.0,Patient,"i'm definitely. there's been. I don't know I don't know if it's. yeah there's been several times, though, where. My prescription hasn't been refilled after my groups and. I go like three or four days without the buprenorphine and. It makes me really sick. that's. that's a big stressor too. And that whole time you know I have chronic pain so it's like i'm dealing with sometimes it's debilitating sometimes I can't literally physically can't get out of bed. yeah it's just causes a lot of anxiety when I have to worry about you know, having a four day supply of medication. And then it doesn't get called in and. I have to wait, you know, two or three days for the virtual clinic to get to my provider. never send it in, and then I have to. wait for the pharmacy to get it ready. Just. A lot."
724.0,Provider,"How are things with you, with your wife grant or where are things out with your wife."
3346.0,Patient,She doesn't respond to my phone cause. been trying to. find the time to get up there and move the rest of our stuff out of storage up there. i've just been too busy here with the weather i'm not sure when it's gonna happen. He also kind of. hesitant to this here after the last time I saw.
724.0,Provider,He was the last time.
3346.0,Patient,"Probably three months ago. Okay, three or four months ago."
724.0,Provider,"Okay, I think you just seen her the last time we saw each other and the last time was like September so it's been yeah quite a quite a bit of time, since we had our last appointment to so okay."
3346.0,Patient,yeah.
724.0,Provider,"yeah so are there, you know, is there paperwork started, are you guys just separated still are moving towards divorce or. Reconciliation or."
3346.0,Patient,"I think there needs to be communication for there to be reconciliation. Yes, open to. I don't know I don't want to. go up there and pick up all my stuff and. be like Oh, by the way, I need you to sign these papers yeah. I was hoping to. have some communication with them and see where that."
724.0,Provider,Was you.
3346.0,Patient,"Go but. She doesn't respond to me at all. i've been in contact with their mother your mother. I don't know. i've been getting notifications that one of her. Credit accounts as pastor was really concerned because it was going to my email that it has her name so. I was concerned that it was a joint account that we had opened or something like that. Impact my credit. But I haven't seen any evidence that it's on my social security number. at all. yeah i've been sending her mom messages. about the persistent emails and getting her accounts best to. and I told her mom. struggling pretty hard financially right now, but if she needs $400 to pay off this account you know. i'll make it work. Her mom told me that it's not my responsibility it's her dad. Not help her with that so. That kinda indirectly tells me that she's not really doing well. And I don't know I. try to get her mom to relay messages to her. issue to delay. It seems like from what her mother tells me she doesn't really respond to her like in regards to messages. yeah my intention is to. You know. go up there and see her and see how she's doing and. have everything set up. With the documents and everything. Just let her know you know I feel like this is going on, along. If you wanted to do some therapy or. You know, try to reconcile at all. willing to, but if not, we need to get. This over with."
724.0,Provider,How long have you guys been separated now grant.
3346.0,Patient,i'm. Going on two years.
724.0,Provider,"So one thought I had is, we can try as best as we can to get your appointment like on the same day, at the same time. If that would help as far as keeping up on your bright heart appointments and, obviously, your group is the same same day in time all the time. But I don't know if that would, if that would be more helpful to try to get you know. Get that set up on our end to help with you know compliance and accountability."
3346.0,Patient,Okay um and there's no way to suffer the same is my group okay can't I can't.
724.0,Provider,"yeah you can't do individual and and group on the same day. because, basically, what happens is it's to your billing into your insurance for two therapy services on the same day. So it, you know they're like. Only allowing one service on one day. I don't know that's just how insurance works."
3346.0,Patient,So.
724.0,Provider,"yeah I know i'm. kind of kind of silly it would be nice to do that, but yeah that's just the way insurance typically works is that they only allow one one type of therapy service per day. So. yeah so as far as with that let's look at. Let me go back here. So we'll need to get because you're required to therapy sessions per month, so we'll need to get another one scheduled before the end of the month. Does around this time work Okay, for you."
3346.0,Patient,"know I need a solution, the weather's bad need at least an hour to get to work."
724.0,Provider,"Okay, then you so you would need to leave it noon, is that right yeah so okay."
3346.0,Patient,"So that's when it. that's why I sent the email that this appointment, when you change the time from 11 to 1130. I was gonna have to reschedule this one, but my boss called me off of work, because the roads are going to close."
724.0,Provider,"Now okay okay so let's do this, what about. um. What about night. I was going to say i've got a i've got a seven or 730 on Monday, the 27th that's two weeks from today."
3346.0,Patient,"But, am I."
724.0,Provider,Am yes your time seven or 730. On Tuesday the 28th. Is got a 10 or 1030.
3346.0,Patient,yeah that will be better.
724.0,Provider,"Okay okay. Do you have a preference 10 or 1030 1030 1030 okay. Alright 1228 at 1030. gotcha all right. And then I want you to think about like what are some therapy goals that you want to focus on as far as for yourself with our sessions. Obviously you know we'll keep up on surveys and attendance and things like that, but as far as like specific like you know treatment goals for yourself things that you want to improve or work on for yourself. grow, so I want you to think about that and we'll kind of come up with some goals and and put some things in place that we can focus on okay. Okay okay sounds good all right well you take care be safe out there grant and and we'll See you in a couple weeks alright. Alright, thanks grant take care bye. All right, this is to wrap up the individual session for grant Hanover and i'll see him again in two weeks, and will continue to monitor compliance issues, and this is the end of the recording Thank you."
