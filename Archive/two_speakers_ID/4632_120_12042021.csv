120.0,Provider,"Right friend okay. Because the third Eva, what do you love her, she actually loves her and she's like I have read the most. Everything in the queue."
4632.0,Patient,"I was. Sad, because so. it's just kind of irrelevant, but i'm so kind of a whole backstory here it's complicated, but essentially."
120.0,Provider,i'm trying to get my computer.
4632.0,Patient,Oh yeah i'm.
120.0,Provider,rattles and I hit it and then it stops so.
4632.0,Patient,"Well, so so my boyfriend um it sounds it sounds bad, but it makes sense. His mom has a dog that she doesn't want anymore. And it was because. His dad was really sick with cancer, and so the siblings were like let's get him a dog let's get him a dog, you know to like cheer him up and he passed and now the mom is stuck with this dog that she never wanted. She doesn't want to stock she never wanted to stop. Now she has raised in stock and it's a puppy still."
120.0,Provider,Oh gosh that's such a bad idea to get somebody who's sick.
4632.0,Patient,"yeah yeah yeah and she's just like I don't want this talk I don't you know and she's she's really at her wits end. And so. Danny was talking about heat so he's away this weekend and we were talking about it, and I was like i've watched ellie that's her name. i'd watch her, and he was like. Oh, you know that's that's a good idea, you know and. Unlike you know it might have been, it was it would have been probably weird because I never read his mom for, and I would have had to go pick up Zoe and then like hi you know but."
120.0,Provider,You know me but yeah.
4632.0,Patient,"I got a little excited thinking that I would have like 48 hours with this dog. And she she had found somebody else to watch her, and so you know wasn't required, but I don't know it was a little like. Little like I think it would have been fun to. yell test out having a dog for a little bit you know."
120.0,Provider,yeah yeah. It would have been fun to be able to kind of see how they what it feels like and what it might be like and.
4632.0,Patient,yeah and.
120.0,Provider,Our wonderful and really hard at the same time.
4632.0,Patient,"yeah and she's she's she's a small she's like. she's like a breed she's not like a rescue and she's a be Sean shih Tzu so she's like really smart and she's a puppy and so she's really like high energy gets in all this trouble, and so, like, I think. You know, probably more than 48 hours i'd be like all right, it was too stressful you know what. Just for that window."
120.0,Provider,"yeah. What are is the is the mom gonna keep it, I mean what cuz."
4632.0,Patient,She does not she does not want to keep the dog and. The idea is that her sister will take it like. there's different people that are in line to take the dog.
120.0,Provider,Okay place to go them.
4632.0,Patient,yeah yeah it's not going to go into. A shelter.
120.0,Provider,"Like I cannot imagine that such a bad to get a dog for someone who's dying of cancer, I mean it's going to be pooping every two puppies puppies are hard you know."
4632.0,Patient,"it's a really bad idea, I know I know, and I feel really bad for this woman because she's just like I didn't want this I didn't want this God damn it out."
120.0,Provider,"But even before then. died past, you know, like you know, like the dog the dog doesn't know someone's dying it's it's going to act like a dog and he silly puppy issue, which is nice."

120.0,Provider,"Now Lucy is gonna go. stand up for yourself, you have claws. what's up with that. he's got me excited about the distraction there's."
4632.0,Patient,"No nose so cute. yeah I mean that. I was actually okay. um. I. Do the past two days I mean I think vaguely during that time, but especially the past two days I don't I don't really know I mean maybe it's because I was like wearing sweatpants for like. That whole time, but my body image has been really bad like really bad i'm not really sure why. I don't know what's going on and. When I think it's been kind of bad for a while, but."
120.0,Provider,"Are you doing anything to intentionally change that because that's going to be the default, for your whole life if you don't intentionally try to unlearn that and that's why I want to ask you kind of what because that that is one thing that I told you this before. That I."
4632.0,Patient,know a lot.
120.0,Provider,"he's ripping up and move. so nervous energy i'm. In recovery, I mean, and you know this, this is not new information. But it takes a hell of a lot of work of mental work, you know and it doesn't just stop it doesn't go away you're not going to suddenly one day wake up and like your body is not going to happen. You know you're gonna problem that end, as all things body image, you know, is the last thing to change in regards to behavior so like. Like it that you know you might have you know you might stop behaviors and then have a couple of years of kind of like nagging body in the stuff you gotta keep kind of pushing against. You. and So you guys have with a battle point like when you're having the when your brain is crap it all over you about your body. Or do you just kind of lay there and you're like you're right it sucks you're right my body is horrible you're right yeah. Like that kind of thing or do you say K five pat positive affirmations go, you know, unlike seeing okay my hands are letting me right on this computer my I let me, you know, whatever it is like really purposely try to in a way brainwash yourself back to a different state."
4632.0,Patient,"yeah no I I. have not, I mean I don't I don't yeah I mean, I think. The positive affirmations I mean, like other things as well, because I don't think I think i've been like better in the past months at doing that, but I don't think i've done it in the past couple of days um and. I know. That this is not my priority, like, I know that. it's it's really far from my priority, and you know I also have. The thing happened, where I look at myself in the mirror or you know it's weird because. You know it's just it's a lot of weird stuff, but I feel like when i'm looking at my body, you know from my vantage point um it's very different, and I know this vantage point is like really wonky and like that's not what everybody else sees. And then, when I look in the mirror i'm like okay okay crazy girl calm down. But then, sometimes I look in the mirror and i'm not like okay crazy girl calm down i'm like you know. I just yeah I think because it's been very loud, I have not been fighting it. And I don't know. yeah I mean like positive affirmations but like I don't know what else to do like I mean, I think you know it's hard. I mean, I think I could get myself. yeah it's hard."
120.0,Provider,"I mean, one of the things that. You know I mean i'm just gonna throw out some different ideas."
4632.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
120.0,Provider,"And I was talking to one of the er doctors, the other day, and we were talking to this patient together and we were talking to the patient. don't do that. Sorry he's trying to pull files out of my cupboard don't that's. My that's not that's patient information, you can have that I have to actually put a lock on it, because he keeps us like I want those things. I find something else he can go shred I gave you a magazine which read that. This is but i'm bored and anyway. we're talking about OCD and he was telling me that when he was the he has some pretty significant OCD himself and he said when he was raised in a family, his mom was very. Very strict about like being good like she was very she was pretty hard on the kids. and on herself about being righteous being good don't do anything wrong, you know you get good grades you do you come home, you know kind of like that, like that was the family, culture and and so he kind of they call that scrupulosity OCD. Like where they're just kind of like what if i'm doing something bad bad What if I did, that bad you know and i've seen that a couple times in in people i've worked with but like they're really worried about accidentally doing something wrong. You know what if I accidentally do this, what if I what, if I have a bad thought, what if I, you know that kind of thing um but anyway. So we were talking about this, and he said that he had done some therapy for his OCD and he said, one of the best things that helped him. Was radical acceptance that he is bad and what he meant by that was he said, well, it goes well if i'm going to hell anyway doesn't really matter i'm okay. You know, and I thought that was it's kind of like it's kind. Of that book. The the power of not giving an F. I think that I think you know that book and. it's. You should You should read it like F bombs, the whole time throughout the whole thing, but I."
4632.0,Patient,love it. love that.
120.0,Provider,"But it's very interesting because it's kind of about. You know if you expect things to this not be okay, then when things are better it's a pleasant surprise. yeah if you always expect things to be good then you're kind of disappointed a lot, which is inherently a difficult feeling to have. And, and not to be like being a pessimist that's not what he's talking about, but more like if you accept that you know if you and the reason i'm sharing this with you because he was like. He said when he started having like you know feel obsessing about oh no i'm not good enough i'm wrong. Like well that's Okay, because i'm already going to hell, he just told myself that or I already stock or whatever and and then that way he can kind of let that go. Because he wasn't having to wrestle with it, so this is just an idea I mean that this is not evidence based or anything but what if you just said, give advice on great it's Okay, though it is what it is, you know kind of just like radical acceptance. yeah instead of like it should look different. Because I mean your body is your body and there's nothing wrong with it, but I know in your mind you're comparing it to what you would like it to be and. it's like obsessing about your feet wanting them to be a different shoe size and it doesn't help you know, like it's not gonna it's just a wasting a lot of energy. And so, instead of working, you know obsessing about that you know be like well it's already you know okay i'm fat whatever like just kind of like accept it, I mean you're not fat, but you know i'm saying just playing with that idea. No, I might be something to play with and see if it would be helpful."
4632.0,Patient,yeah I think that's really I think that's all very interesting.
120.0,Provider,I was coming wow that is.
4632.0,Patient,"it's it's hard, but I think I did I did do something similar. Because I feel like i'm in this trap, where I can say that, and then i'm so angry and i'm so frustrated about it, and then I that never resolves and I feel like. When I was first getting sober I had that same thing, where it was like i'm an alcoholic and i'd be like that's not fair, you know that's not fair, why don't I get to drink when I get to go."
120.0,Provider,But that's part of the grief process.
4632.0,Patient,"yeah and it's like no it's like you know, and I was so angry about that, and now i'm like. Okay, you guys go drink like have a fun, you know what I mean like now I."
120.0,Provider,recognize that yeah.
4632.0,Patient,"i'm no longer frustrated with it i've I really accepted it, and I recognize that that's something that I don't get to have that millions billions of people. get to have."
120.0,Provider,"Is if you're allergic to peanuts you don't sit around feeling bad that you can't eat peanuts, you know or whatever."
4632.0,Patient,"yeah and I think that I have just never. accepted, really, really accepted. That my body, if I really give it what it needs. is not going to look the way I want it to look, and I think i'm still just in this like throwing a tantrum, no, no, no that's not acceptable."
120.0,Provider,"I think that's a really good insight. you're recognizing that that there's a part of you that. Like you're hitting your head against the wall and everyone's just like Okay, but you're the only one suffering, you know you're not. Because I know you mentioned, I was looking at my notes from last time, and you know you were kind of constantly trying to prove yourself. You know, and again we wrote, I wrote the joke's on you, because you know you're the one who is suffering like you could spend the rest of your life obsessing about your body and it's not going to get you it's not going to benefit you at all and it's not going to benefit the world."
4632.0,Patient,Is not.
120.0,Provider,"You know. Until you got to think what do until like I don't know, I just want to keep encouraging you. To think what do I really want is there something else I want, because this is a distraction."
4632.0,Patient,yeah well.
120.0,Provider,"This is a side trip, you know that you're on of where you want to be where you're at in your life."
4632.0,Patient,"yeah so on the note of what do I realize, and they say, but I was just thinking so i've been watching this. I should probably stop watching it, because all the girls are like ridiculous and skinny but i've been watching the stupid show on netflix called. Selling sunset and it's these like realtors in La and they sell these million dollar houses and you know it's just like trash TV kind of energy it's pretty entertaining."
120.0,Provider,I spent a lot of time and. salons and everything you know.
4632.0,Patient,"Exactly it's like their their bit, their body in their face is like part of their job so it's a little bit different for me, you know are."
120.0,Provider,A lot different.
4632.0,Patient,"yeah yeah. But I was just watching a wedding the other day, and I just kept thinking like. You know that's one of those things I feel like i'm right now right like getting married fitting into a dress fitting into a wedding dress and then. You know, is it too tight like what that whole thing like that's something I feel like it's going to be so painful that I won't even be. You know, like."
120.0,Provider,"The dresses wrong and not your body, what if the dress needs to be changed fit your body. Instead of your body if it's some arbitrary dress. The dress you know you're trying to force."
4632.0,Patient,We just want the one that yeah.
120.0,Provider,"yeah it's not it's not your body's not the problem it's the dresses you know it's kind of like you, you know, there you have to start really changing trying to change the way you think about it, and I know it's hard, because your you know your neural pathways are well practiced with this. For years and years and years, you know, but the only way to unlearn it is to intentionally like I told I showed you the video of the backwards bicycle then we watch that together. Remember that were the guys trying to train his body to read read about a bicycle that goes the opposite way of what he's used to. And it takes him eight months to figure out how to do it and we finally does. It but he still has to concentrate on it and be focused on it, because otherwise his body will his little kid who was like five or something. Figures it out in like two weeks because he's just hasn't practiced the other way for a year he hasn't practiced the other way for years and years and years, you know and. You know, so you kind of have to you know buckle down with hey i'm gonna have to you know, like yeah and then other pieces using that radical acceptance does your body is what it is. You know I mean if you wanted to become a movie star it's been years and salons and. talking to people who make you take lenses and all that kind of stuff like that is your production, this is what I have to offer the world. yeah but eventually those people are going to get old to you know, eventually, those people unless that's really what you that's the ultimate thing that you have to offer the world is the ornament that is your body to hang on a tree somewhere. You know, for everyone to look at it like this doesn't mean anything. But I just I think that you, you know, I feel that you My guess is that you feel lonely alive and that you don't feel like you're valuable. Unless you're performing in some way and that the body is the easiest performance, I mean it's one of the immediate performances that you have to offer."
4632.0,Patient,"And I. You know. So a kind of crazy thing happened on Friday so. yesterday. I like I hadn't talked to katia for a while. And um you know I get it, she comes into work, and you know i'm already at work and. And I I had some stuff I wanted to show her, so I think I talked to you, like a little bit about the direction that I want to take the project in. is studying the female mice right and so that's kind of what i've been really focused on so I wanted to show her some stuff on that, so I did and. And she was excited about that and then she goes well, it was she told me she also had something she wanted to talk to me about um so I was like so you know, and she said. So, so the girl that you know position, I took over her name is alyssa um and so she had this big huge paper that she wrote recently. and So how this works is like when you write a paper you at least in our lab katia you can only send it to wonder, and a lot of time and katia likes to go for like the best journal. first, and then you get you know, a rejection letter and then you know you keep going down list, however, they send it to their highest caliber journal, and instead of an immediate rejection they sent it off to the reviewers. So that means. You know it's worth it's worth at least."
120.0,Provider,worth.
4632.0,Patient,"Looking at you know and really studying and so they got comments back from the reviewers and. there's a couple things they recommend it and she said, so what I want to do right now is, I want to take this paper, and I want to break it into two parts, and so, for the first paper. You know alyssa has already done a lot of there's some still some stuff that needs to be done and alyssa is going to do that, but I want you to do this super resolution microscopy. And so. If, when you do that if you'll do that, I want you to be a second author on this paper. wow and then on the second paper, she was like and so then like it's it's this big proteomics paper, and so it identifies like all these different possible targets. and She wants without one to look into one of those targets, more specifically, and try to understand how it could be playing a role or a couple of the targets and. She was like and if you do, that I either want you to be a second or call first author and I was like oh my God like what. I direct quote I said i'm freaking out and she said no you're not always like oh I. Oh, my God, because you know here I am thinking, like i'm not gonna i'm not going to publish anything for like four years right, and this is going to be a while away and, but this is still like."
120.0,Provider,that's so cool.
4632.0,Patient,By.
120.0,Provider,That is huge.
4632.0,Patient,"it's it's crazy it's amazing and I was just like she was like so are you okay with this and I was like absolutely, because this would mean that we'd only focus on the males but, like the whole thing is that. That the story that alyssa was telling is not wrapped up. And so, she wants to wrap it up a little bit more."
120.0,Provider,"Do you like, do you like her. That lady."
4632.0,Patient,yeah yeah I yes she's.
120.0,Provider,What do you like about her yeah.
4632.0,Patient,"um. Well she's she's brilliant. mm hmm she works really hard. She does you know she does. I know this is not, this is not why I, like her, because there's a lot of people that do this that I don't like but. She wears like I can always hear when she's coming because she does wear heels."
120.0,Provider,And she liked quick.
4632.0,Patient,You know yeah and she likes to wear her jewelry and her outfits and like.
120.0,Provider,I even left herself.
4632.0,Patient,"I like that, too, you know I like that that she's this incredible brilliant woman and she. looks she she likes to look Nice."
120.0,Provider,"You know, and her definition of Nice."
4632.0,Patient,yeah exactly and and I feel like. yeah I mean.
120.0,Provider,"See and and that's, the reason I asked you that because I imagine like when you saw those people on TV and you thought oh they're so thin whatever you know, like but, but you lit up when you were talking about this experiment. yeah That is something that you that actually feed your soul, you know you can tell that you like that stuff that the, the body image if that's a consolation prize. that's the cracker jack price that's like you know oh here, you know thanks for playing kind of thing yeah and. Like I want you to you know start looking at what are the qualities that I really want that are maybe a little bit more. Important than necessarily what I mean because the first thing you said about her was that she was brilliant you didn't say. Oh, she she's really tall or she's she's really good. or she has good skin or whatever yeah you know it was about what she does it's about you know we talked about the masterpiece in your life, not the paintbrush. you're not admiring her paintbrush your admiring the work that she does yeah you know and and the work is lasting you know that's something that builds throughout your life, I mean physical appearance usually decreases. Over time yeah no I mean you're probably Adam and how old, are you 24."
4632.0,Patient,We three or almost.
120.0,Provider,"yeah I mean you're you're kind of at the you know you're probably trying to hold on to this because you know it does shift, you know yeah but you probably won't shift into known until you're in your 30s or whatever, but. But still you're not going to be here, but when you're 70 I mean that's."
4632.0,Patient,that's not how it works now.
120.0,Provider,"And neither should you know, and you should have like it's like your brain has progressed since you were 17 and yeah you know, so you know you have to kind of find a different higher power to think about in regards to your what you want. what's what's the overall story of that like that your instead of worshipping body image, you need to find something else to kind of. Put as your central theater life which could be education or it could be relationships or it could be, you know, like becoming the person you'd like to become, but I know it's hard i'm not saying it's easy i'm just trying, you have to start really pushing yourself to think that way."
4632.0,Patient,and getting this news was like.
120.0,Provider,And that's amazing.
4632.0,Patient,"I mean yeah I mean, and I know it's still far away right it's still like a year from now it's still."
120.0,Provider,"filled, though."
4632.0,Patient,it's so much more than I ever.
120.0,Provider,mm hmm.
4632.0,Patient,"Ever I mean I just. and You know, it does like okay like not only and she's like I still want you to work on your project, but you know I want you to do this, and I think this is like a safer bet for you as well, and um. You know it's like. I don't know it does make me think like you know it's. yeah I mean this is like I want to be strong, for this, I want to be steady for this, I want to you know i'm going to be going in and using this how many hundred thousand dollar microscope. You know, and I need to be it needs to be very present and."
120.0,Provider,"Think about katia would she does all those things, and she can still wear jewelry wear high heels like if she can she can decorate her body how she would like to she can kind of. express that side of her yeah but she you know she's not sacrificing her brains at the time ever seen point you know. Like it like you can still be you know you can still dress up if you want to you can do the things that make you feel you know more positive about your body, but you got to work on not obsessing about the size. yeah because the size of it is not gonna you know it is not that's not the that's not the goal."
4632.0,Patient,yeah.
120.0,Provider,"Because then she's getting a paper over there and you're like but i'm wearing this size now you know, like. No one cares."
4632.0,Patient,"it's so yeah. are relevant and I just don't. I mean, I know I know it's so pointless and I know as well that when i'm feeling like disgusting I see my boyfriend he doesn't notice. He doesn't care. I mean, nobody can."
120.0,Provider,Nobody nobody cares.
4632.0,Patient,Nobody cares.
120.0,Provider,"But I know it's so so deep rooted I I get it, I mean i've been in recovery for a long time, and I have bad body image days I don't do anything to change it, I was like okay i'm gonna go be the worst is you know I just go back to doing what i'm doing. Just kind of navigate it but don't change your food to to you know don't behaviorally change things you know to manage that feeling because it's really a feeling, you know it's a bad body image it well, it is a feeling. But it's more of like a thought feeling kind of state of mind that you get stuck in. And so, when you're in that you know you guys can take care of yourself just like if you're feeling grief about something or if you're feeling angry about something or if you're whatever feeling your have you kind of take care of yourself. yeah within it, I don't be like I got six cheese, you know. But I wonder if it's a way of distracting that I wondering if it's like that's a you know what What if you're if you're naturally kind of afraid of being successful. you've made maybe you're kind of afraid of you know, because then they're like well if this paper thing doesn't work out I can always just be really thin. You know that that's kind of my my secret power, you know that that that can be what i'm good at being sick kind of thing."
4632.0,Patient,"yeah. Or you know, I think."
120.0,Provider,"it's like you're back you're back secret, you know. yeah yeah."
4632.0,Patient,"Well, and I think. what's. I mean I I also wonder. You know I don't really practice downtime."
120.0,Provider,mm hmm.
4632.0,Patient,"You know, and so I think i'm still uncomfortable with unless I have you know, unless i'm seeing a friend or less mz Danny. You know it's like. I don't know how to just take it easy, and I think I still feel like Oh, you know i'm supposed to be working hard all the time I can't I can't take a break i'm."
120.0,Provider,What does it break. Are you doing art very much recently.
4632.0,Patient,"I have not. I have been doing, one of the things i've been doing in my free time. Is shopping i'm getting. i'm getting all my Christmas presents."
120.0,Provider,Okay.
4632.0,Patient,"I was wrapping some Christmas presents yesterday. I feel like that's that's fun that's engaging felt super drawn to paint recently I got a new crossword puzzle on my phone. Right um but yeah I mean, I think I think I still don't think. I don't know. How to check out of work and be okay with that and be okay with saying no i'm not going to do any work for the next four hours because I don't want to."
120.0,Provider,uh huh.
4632.0,Patient,or I don't need to. Do mostly cuz I don't want to.
120.0,Provider,"Well, and that's how you treat painting you don't force yourself to do it, where you know when it's not you're not drawn to it, you let it be you know and. You know it's okay to do that with work to you know, unless you have an obvious if you have a deadline or something you have to kind. Of get something done but yeah if it's like just not feeling it it's okay yeah. What happens to your mind when you're have downtime like what, why is that feeling what what happens in that space."
4632.0,Patient,"yeah I mean, I think I do just feel. Really. Anxious. yeah."
120.0,Provider,"so anxious, can you identify what what thoughts are is this your body is it like a nervous energy or is it your body. yeah like what if this What if this kind of thing."
4632.0,Patient,yeah I feel I feel anxious that I feel. Like i'm missing out like I should be doing something enter.
120.0,Provider,promo stuff.
4632.0,Patient,i'm like. Oh yeah we're like you know i'm i'm i'm a piece of trash you know because. i'm.
120.0,Provider,"Welcome, and that society has kind of taught us that that you know people pride themselves on being busy. yeah you know, like what i'm so busy I said, you know people talk about you know, and I feel like I did nothing today I just sat around people are like what you know, because people pride themselves on kind of exhausting themselves. yeah but I was feeling that way at my job, the other day, because I have a Co worker that keeps working these back to back shifts which I think is dangerous because she hasn't slept. And you can't be really working with somebody in their moment of stress, you know when they're suicidal or something and you're just like yawning you know. Like you gotta be able to focus but there's part of me is like Maybe I should do it yeah you know what Maybe I should be working harder yeah I get that because there's kind of this like. glorification of exhausting yourself yeah."
4632.0,Patient,"yeah. yeah and I. I know that not I mean I know megan works like I do, I mean, I think. I don't know I mean for some reason I mean so katia said, you know I think it's because I sell this chip on my shoulder right and it's like Oh, I still have something to prove and. I mean katia believes in me um."
120.0,Provider,yeah.
4632.0,Patient,"I got an email, the other day she sent to the woman that we're gonna be working with she was like and he is a talented Grad student and I was like."
120.0,Provider,"You don't see it you just don't see it, because you are yeah he's like."
4632.0,Patient,you're a hard worker and I was like. You know i'm just like. and yeah I mean I just. I just think. There needs to know how to. yeah how to. relax a little bit I know.
120.0,Provider,So maybe maybe think of it. think I know i've said this before it's not new but let's begin to think of the person that you would like to become like what do you just caught anything katia does on her on her time off if she's ever they should bridges bridges like what do you think she does. Nobody watches TV or just you know. He cleans her part her cleans your house or rose or law or.
4632.0,Patient,"I think. This is something i'm i'm a little curious about as well because her husband so she's a principal investigator so she has her own lab, which is a big deal. Her husband is also a ppi. wow at Johns Hopkins. So they're both run in and taught they both run their own laboratory just like so much work right it's like and they have two children and i'm like how did you what."
120.0,Provider,"Did you do all this yeah I didn't do that, so I imagine for years."
4632.0,Patient,"When she came home she took care of her children and like. raise children right, and you know and like. You know that that's also something I want I did I do want I mean I think that's very down the line, for me, but. You know. I mean, I even think like. You know. there's a lot of there's a lot of things I can do in terms of just cleaning organizing I mean that's."
120.0,Provider,that's right oh me too me too i'm horrible at that.
4632.0,Patient,that's that's that's an activity that. They feel good about.
120.0,Provider,"And I like I. I I do wish you had some sort of pet in regards to that, I mean, because I know that it's not necessarily the right time, but you know, like her kids need her. You know. She automatically has a purpose, you know, and if if you come home to an empty apartment where you're like no one's depending on you, and no one needs anything from you. it's easy to kind of just engage in distraction behaviors yeah you know, but like if you haven't had a dog with like hi i'm gonna go do something, and you know, like. or like you know that you're like i'm gonna look for some i'm gonna make some dog toys i'm going to teach my dog new tricks or i'm gonna go to dog class or whatever. You know, or some other hobby where someone depends on you like, where you're like where you're involved in creating an art group. or something or you're involved in a service club at school or something. That it gives you a purpose, even if you don't want to be doing it all the time. Just like you know you don't people don't want to be, you know dealing with playing with their kids all the time, because that gets exhausting. And, but because you committed to it and because you love that person you do it anyway, and so that can be stronger than your eating disorder. Like I know somebody asked me today like what my main recovery thing wasn't it was animals like that's really what it did was. The dogs and the horses and and then meeting me and having to work really hard for it, and so you know kind of like you know they have a lab they have to run, but they also run the family and so they're probably exhausted a lot but it's probably like a good fulfilling exhaustion. You know."
4632.0,Patient,yeah.
120.0,Provider,"Is that I would hope so, if they're if they're balancing it right support each other and all that is it's going to be, you know that's a lot with it, that they have. But I mean I don't know like I do you think that there's any bandwidth to like become a volunteer for like an adoption organization, where you go and sit with the animals that pets mark during adoption events. Or you work on transport like there's a service here that. When people are in a hospital for cove ID or whatever else or psych, especially if it's like where it was completely. Like police pick them up and take him to the hospital or whatever their animals are left, and you know and there's a service here, where people will temporarily foster an animal, while the owner is in the hospital. Because I don't know what happened to mine, I have a lot of friends that would come and take care of them, but. yeah if I got really sick and you know, maybe you could volunteer for a service like that, like a temporary foster or. Something to give you like something else to think about it."
4632.0,Patient,"yeah I mean I don't you know I don't know if. There is time now. But I don't know I mean, I think I could. put a cap back on the table, like I don't know."
120.0,Provider,"Well, you just gotta you know, like we got to figure out kind of the sweet spot of having purpose and structure, without having so much that you're constantly distracting because I, we want to kind of squeeze out the eating disorder a little bit."
4632.0,Patient,"Yes, yes. Please."
120.0,Provider,"uh huh it's gotten significantly better, which is."
4632.0,Patient,"and And you know I think I wonder, though. If adding more to the equation right is like it's like I think you have like you know it's just like stress, you know you add more and then it's like i'm just more stressed and then and like I feel like if the remainder is just like me. just doing dumb stuff."
120.0,Provider,"Well yeah because you're you have a really I think that you're You were right when that your brain has a hard time kind of relaxing. You know, and so I think it fills. itself if you're not. distracted or busy you're engaged in something, and you know that's one of things about the animals is that they always you can always do something you can always train them something you can, especially if it's a dog. You can always take about for a walk you can always do something with them, and you know, for me, having a farm there's always projects like today i'm just like. You know, like I get I want the fencing I gotta do and I gotta drag the horse arena and I got to do all these things, and so there's, even if I don't but I was gonna die if I don't you know, like, I can sit around to it and put it off another day but it gives you things to do if. You know they're never bored. And that's why I just thought like if you could get involved, especially if you were like there's a vet Facebook group right now that I follow. it's so good it's actually very, very deep, I find it very interesting. That it's a Facebook group, where people you know have questions about some particular thing and their their animals struggling with. Basically, like is this normal or does this need event or whatever, and people can post it on there, and only vets can respond and so anybody else who responds gets blocked. yeah and and they absolutely do not allow any angry emojis like you can do you know. Is because they're trying because they're like that we're not going to fight we're not this is, for this is professional learning space. So, in order to comment, you have to go through this process of kind of being approved as that and if we're all over the world there's all over different countries and stuff and they're like thousands of members in this group. But I love reading their posts because it's just it's so interesting yeah like some growth or some. You know, some behavior that they're trying to figure out and there's one for dogs and cats there's one for chicken there's one boats and there's ones for behavioral veterinary behaviorist and that can come in and they're doing it voluntarily. But anyway, the reason i'm telling you this. Is they were asking if anyone would be willing to volunteer to be an admin because the admins are basically what that means is that they have to kind of. screen these people and if people are commenting when they shouldn't be you have to go through and delete their comment and put up this little. sign this is pleasing not comment if you're Not a bit you know you will be blocking, but they do it again, you block them, you know, so you know there's people that are voluntary and kind of watching this website, and I can see, because it's like you can do that, whenever you want to."
4632.0,Patient,sound like yeah so.
120.0,Provider,"Many hours, but so they were asking for volunteers and I thought that was interesting."
4632.0,Patient,yeah.
120.0,Provider,"You know so there's needs like you could. Do something where you have. You know something else that kind of lets you, you know gives you a break from life but it's something that you commit to so that you can't just blow it off yeah you know I don't know if that's just an idea. Or you know, like if you worked like if you know, like I get into animal rabbit other girls girl who volunteers at a cat rescue. Every like every other weekend So if you knew i'm gonna i'm going to be working at the cat rescue from 8am to noon on Saturday. Then you know that you can't just blow that off like it's something that you think about something in and then, when you go home, you can so budget verge if you want to you know, but hopefully it's given you a little bit of purpose, so I don't know it's something to think about."
4632.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
120.0,Provider,"Because that time is there, whether you fill it with volunteering or purging. But you've done great with the behaviors that sounds like you've had body image issues, but I what I appreciate, is that you, you recognizing the body image stuff that's hitting your heart and it's like a tsunami of thought."
4632.0,Patient,hey yeah.
120.0,Provider,it's so so hard but you're not it sounds like you're not turning into behaviors.
4632.0,Patient,"So there was. A Benjamin smaller side yesterday and so that means that I have to be solid this weekend, which I think. I can do it's hard because Danny Sana here he's away he's running a marathon. So my."
120.0,Provider,marathon I could you go watch him.
4632.0,Patient,it's in San Francisco.
120.0,Provider,Oh OK.
4632.0,Patient,So no.
120.0,Provider,"No okay yeah no. I bet you might be able to I mean think about if you hadn't I mean not too late now, but like if you if you save them money you from binges and you could buy an airplane ticket."
4632.0,Patient,yeah well you know if he does run the Boston marathon so this time he'll be if he gets the right mile. Then you know I don't think i'd really want to sit and watch a marathon but.
120.0,Provider,yeah.
4632.0,Patient,"Because I don't really know where you, you know where do you sit right."
120.0,Provider,"They don't know how you try it you don't know till yeah yeah, but I could you know that I could."
4632.0,Patient,we'll see.
120.0,Provider,"I mean, I imagine he has people in his life that are going to go cheer for him, you know, unless he's going all by himself I don't know."
4632.0,Patient,"yeah I think he's chatting with friends, I could be wrong about that."
120.0,Provider,"Because there might be other people, I mean I don't know i'm just saying something to think about but."
4632.0,Patient,"There, but so he's not here, so my plan for this weekend, since I had three days off, I was like oh i'll go to the lab go through some stuff to. Go to the lab. and I have some work, I want to do um and then you know give myself a nice activity give myself a time like I like this idea i've been trying to do this more being like. Okay at nine o'clock depending on how many hours, I worked right like nine o'clock I check off nine o'clock I check out and then I can do whatever I want. I can do. You know I can just play a crossroad on my phone because I it's kind of fun and having fun with that um. yeah I haven't been."
120.0,Provider,"How are you doing with meal planning, are you eating. Three times a day. yeah are you trying to you know, are you just kind of like scattered with it."
4632.0,Patient,"i've been i've been good, because I got this new I changed from East to get Hello fresh, which is a meal planning, and now I get imperfect food so that's just a lot more food um but it's not organized in a meal format, so I have a lot of different. Things I can cook um so I got like salmon and template this week, so I you know and getting multiple proteins multiple vegetables multiple grains so. i've been doing good the body image has. made it a little harder."
120.0,Provider,Because that's one thing that colleen has told me multiple times regards to you is that you know that it it you just keep restricting and that that's what sets.
4632.0,Patient,yeah.
120.0,Provider,"like this, you have this underlying you know the body missing I think drives it probably and you know it's like I don't want to eat enough because I want to maintain. A low weight, you know, and I want to keep my superpower of eating disorder, you know I have, I must keep it, you know I must not you know, but if you really could. You know eat, to the point of fullness are you weighing yourself to. Know okay good."
4632.0,Patient,Absolutely not.
120.0,Provider,"But if you could figure out how to kind of nourish your body, it probably would squish out the binge purge behaviors at least. Because it's hard it's hard to binge when you're not hungry, you know I mean like when you're not you might eat some, but you know you don't enjoy it as much because you're not. it's like if you just ate dinner and then thanksgiving shows up you're like you know it just it doesn't taste as good doesn't feel as good."
4632.0,Patient,It doesn't.
120.0,Provider,"know but, but if you kind of secretly like this is forbidden, then it feels almost like a rebellion a little bit what you do and you know, we know that you have a bit of a rebellion. For sure and Lucy. Why don't you see why are you whining. Because I need everything to need to have meat you're not fulfilling me. I took her collar off cuz I was like you don't really need it when you're in the House. Oh really in the House. she's kept anyway, so if she ever did get."
4632.0,Patient,she's chipped oh Nice.
120.0,Provider,"i'll have my animals are because I i'm paranoid, and I want."
4632.0,Patient,A lot. Oh she's so cute I can't.
120.0,Provider,hear the teddy bear cat.
4632.0,Patient,he's so cute it's not real. face.
120.0,Provider,"My gosh Greta when I had to get to pee last night. I use both uses cats and Lucy usually both on the bed. And georgina used to but ever since a moose arrived cheese doesn't want to shoot I haven't seen her for on the bed a lot so she's. she's usually hangs out she's she's a different. month or you have met her because she's my cupboard cat. yeah like saying on the cover its most the time and so she's very sweet, though."
4632.0,Patient,yeah.
120.0,Provider,"But anyway, last night I was like sleeping and Greta I had to get up a bit you know you know I can't move because I have a cat on the set and kind of decide. Oh, and so I like pick up the blankets and move them over my body and put him down and gratitude. wall. It she doesn't even wake up like I get out and come back and I cried like a baby baby for back over to the other side. Because it's just cancer just hilarious because I like you know, have to like like a. Like a hammock like super up under the blanket and just. And she just like. You know, like she doesn't."
4632.0,Patient,"Look, you."
120.0,Provider,just looking at me like. Just kind of staring at you and i'm like what. I could do next Saturday.
