298.0,Provider,"Okay. It looks like you're almost coming on. hello, Melissa. I am doing well, no complaints happy to see you i'm."
14708.0,Patient,yeah i'm sorry I haven't been feeling very well at all last week.
298.0,Provider,So sorry.
14708.0,Patient,"yeah I had someone sticking with me and they actually stole my car seven had a car for like a week and it's just been a really like ongoing aggravated process so. I was having been making my anxiety up a lot lately. But I also have a model all out of my. My lamictal I ran out yesterday was my last one. Okay, so i'm actually coming up at the end of everything right now."
298.0,Provider,"But wasn't just a day or two ago, like on know that was no, you should be coming up on everything. So let's go through it. here's the problem I need you, I can't. You you're going to end up getting discharged from our program if you don't go to all your appointments so. i'm going to have to cut one of your scripts down till you are, you know compliant so are you taking the circle 20 minutes 25 milligrams twice a day."
14708.0,Patient,"um I am, but I could probably cut that one down if I need to cut."
298.0,Provider,"any of them you don't know no, no, no, you don't need to cut. it's it's how many times you go to the pharmacy like. The one that all. Caught It is like the clonazepam how often are you using the Finance of him."
14708.0,Patient,"um I used that pretty much every day, but I was also wondering if since i've been on that so long, if I should maybe be going on something else that is similar or what I should be doing it will happen on that for quite a while. I don't yeah as strong as a you know used to be, because it doesn't seem like it helps."
298.0,Provider,"it's not it's not as strong it's so easy to build. Tolerance to any any benzodiazepine we can try and switch you over to another one, but at the same time it's all benzodiazepines and you've used those receptors and they're just not like they used to that's why we go down and you're on a pretty decent sized stills."
14708.0,Patient,And so i'm kind of in the midst of a I guess you'd call a mental breakdown of sorts so that's kind of why i'm are medicated now that I.
298.0,Provider,Normally we got our donors.
14708.0,Patient,"it's cuz i'm kind of that they took them a really long time to figure out with me, what would work medication wise, so it probably looks weird but they. Were they found it for me, because I have so many conflicting things like my fibromyalgia and then my anxiety and my ptsd and trauma and depression, I have all these weird things going on. And so they've they've had to check for hard time finding the right combo lamictal has been very helpful with my pain and everything so. That has been a good medication for me so far i'd like to think more about what could potentially you know be good if maybe if it went up on that medication if that would help with my anxiety because it's, the main problem i'm still having is my anxiety and my motivation. I my anxiety is still been crazy but. You know, but my motivation, it gives me anxiety, even worse, because when I can't motivate myself to do anything, such as login for cause or anything like that it's like that that really messes me up obviously so and I find it, you know my i'm still not having a lot of motivation. Unless I take my adderall that day, but you know it's it's a must it's one of those days that if that doesn't happen, then I don't I find I don't really have much of. motivation at all and i'm wondering if paxil is still probably the right option or if there's something else I needed maybe take for depression, on top of everything I don't know. I just know that the gavin's been helping in. The quantum been was once upon a time, but I think I might need to change and go to something else."
298.0,Provider,is so high you're. repentant is so high that it should be doing better than your clin as a path.
14708.0,Patient,"Right, but it has. been it barely."
298.0,Provider,It helps a little at your clinic Pam is destroying your motivation.
14708.0,Patient,"Okay okay. Well, I don't know that that's true because some days, if I don't have my chronic pain and I can still get motivated, if I have an adder but otherwise it's very difficult to get myself, out of a. Panic attack so."
298.0,Provider,"I don't know it's like trade off one thing for another itself. Right, the long term use of a benzodiazepine is low motivation brain."
14708.0,Patient,Okay don't leave.
298.0,Provider,don't leave so. that's why it's not a great.
14708.0,Patient,"Train What about something like panel to use in conjunction I know they have given that to me in the past, would that be considerable to how. amazing down on some gabba or something."
298.0,Provider,That would be awesome.
14708.0,Patient,"But gabapentin doesn't I mean, I can see how the executive medication tells at least help a little really the gap and just helps with the aches and pains. And you know from a fibromyalgia it doesn't really help with anxiety all that much."
298.0,Provider,At that level but. It doesn't.
14708.0,Patient,"it's not really it's just me, maybe it's because i've been on that for a long time, too, but it actually really never helped too much with my anxiety it just helps with aches and pains with fibromyalgia a little bit. But not not like crazy, though not like the mixer helps with text aches and pains actually. Like so does my for that."
298.0,Provider,lamictal helps with aches and pains.
14708.0,Patient,"It helps with for me, for some reason and i've been trying to figure out why that may be, and like if you know if that helps if there's anything like it that I could put in conjunction with it, that would help even more with my pain, or if."
298.0,Provider,you're not at a high dose yet not even close with. A MIC. I love nickel isn't going to cause a brain fog.
14708.0,Patient,go up to.
298.0,Provider,Be silly I have people I have people on 400 because their depression it's just okay.
14708.0,Patient,"All right, well, I like. It was too much for me when I went on it to 201 month time it was like it had a mess me up I had it wasn't doing too great on it, but as I just went down to the 155, but that was over a year ago, so I think I can go up to 200 again and. yeah."
298.0,Provider,I think it's been in your system long enough. yeah and it would probably do fine.
14708.0,Patient,Right okay well that should help then um and hopefully that will help us some of the anxiety to that would be great.
298.0,Provider,"it's not as a rule, it doesn't really help with anxiety in a direct way it helps by lessening the depression."
14708.0,Patient,gotcha perfect. that's. All for.
298.0,Provider,"And so i'm giving you propranolol you can take it whenever you want. Like it's at it twice a day. It just calms. The body down. If you can use it to lower any of your other depressants use it instead. Even better, like it, you can get rid of. Lower your gap that can lower your lower your seroquel anything. can do. seroquel can also take away your motivation."
14708.0,Patient,"I was wondering about that, because it seems like i'm sleeping a lot more, since I. saw this one, a lot coming off of that I don't really notice it doing anything of significant value to help me so."
298.0,Provider,"I don't know, I think."
14708.0,Patient,yeah go off it.
298.0,Provider,uh huh I think you should go off is because we're running into the problem of what's called polypharmacy there's too many.
14708.0,Patient,"I gotcha all right yeah that's that'll be good to get rid of one of them, oh."
298.0,Provider,And I have the ambien for sleep at night.
14708.0,Patient,Oh yeah.
298.0,Provider,"and Now let's talk about the Finance of him. I almost don't want to make any choices with it, this month. And if I see you regularly. let's talk about going devalue them."
14708.0,Patient,"Okay, all right that sounds like a plausible."
298.0,Provider,So look at look up value look what people are saying it's a long acting benzo like clonazepam.
14708.0,Patient,"think I was on it once before I just made me a little more tired, I believe, but. yeah."
298.0,Provider,You don't need that help.
14708.0,Patient,"But you know, like if if i'm gonna have to try to figure out one I mean i'm probably going to take a usually at night, anyway, unless i'm having panic attacks and the day. I don't have so. yeah we'll just we'll see how this goes fingers crossed."
298.0,Provider,"I hear ya. yeah I hear you, you know people who see me often we usually figure it out, but."
14708.0,Patient,I haven't been so great thanks a lot. i'm gonna get better.
298.0,Provider,"All right, any suicidal or homicidal thoughts. know how have your moods didn't."
14708.0,Patient,"Even kind of like up and down but it's been really stressful because i've been looking for a new place and my car got taken. or just been going through a lot, like the last like month and a half, so I feel like i'm a little overwhelmed and so it kind of makes sense for my moods to be up and down more than usual, but I think it is something worth noting, though, so. A bell more Moody than usual, and I don't know if it's just the stress, or you know if it's medically. Think it's probably just the stress. Getting your card stolen is not. Not a very stressful thing, while you're trying to move. Okay, that makes things crazy for a minute."
298.0,Provider,"Alright um. The lamictal is going to help with that moodiness irritability that's what i'm still does so you'll be. Okay, that way. I how's your appetite."
14708.0,Patient,"it's pretty good it kind of comes to goals, I mean when i'm more anxious obviously it's not you know, a strong I tend to not be as hungry when i'm anxious so. it's been coming going more going recently because anxiety been crazy again but it's been an average of. Nothing crazy."
298.0,Provider,"Okay, then I will see you at group and make."
14708.0,Patient,A call.
298.0,Provider,With me.
14708.0,Patient,Tuesday at one right.
298.0,Provider,That is correct.
