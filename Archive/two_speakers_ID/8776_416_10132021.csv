ID,Role,Message
416.0,Provider,Sir. it's going well how about you.
8776.0,Patient,"doing just fine kind of cozy spot in the corner of my room and Tina just got out of the shower a little bit and got dressed yeah wanted to be more you know, upright and moving for this meeting."
416.0,Provider,yeah how have things been going in your life.
8776.0,Patient,"Work and your friend good everything yeah. I had a really good day yesterday um I brought over some poetry that i've been writing over to my friend jerry's house, I have no Jared since I was like 13. And he lives really close by so hadn't seen him in a while, because he was out of town. But it was really cool because we just got to hang out like one on one and just talk about movies and joke around and stuff and. he's gonna help me format, some of those poems so into like a little magazine because we used to make the scenes together like when we were teenagers and stuff so that was awesome. yeah. I got to play drums at his house for a little bit to which I hadn't done in a really long time. yeah things have been going pretty good yeah."
416.0,Provider,"Okay, good so um any talk to you a little bit about groups and MED follow ups and stuff like that, because you are. You are high on the list to get discharged because you haven't seen tanya and and you've missed some groups. what's going on with that."
8776.0,Patient,"Well um so yesterday I set an alarm. For group I was totally you know the night before like prepared to wake up and do it, and I just slept through the alarm entirely. So there was that and then yeah last time we talked I was getting i'm getting the same amount of meds from a different doctor here at Nevada county. So I wasn't sure if I still needed to continue to see titania I guess there was kind of maybe some confusion there."
416.0,Provider,"So, and I mean yeah I know you probably don't need to continue to see her as long as you're getting it from another source. And and that's and you're feeling stable on that, but um. But the group thing is kind of a big deal."
8776.0,Patient,"Okay um yeah and like I said, like, I was been wanting to and i've been like trying to make it it's just a maybe it's just too early in the morning there's an 11 o'clock one as well right."
416.0,Provider,"um yeah i'm sure there's we have groups, we have a lot of different groups but they're not they're not with me, it would be with a different provider, but yes, a time that works better, for you, we could look at that."
8776.0,Patient,"Well, I mean that's the that's the tricky part is I would prefer to be in your group on Tuesday it's just i've been having a hard time. Because I want to be like you know, like up and like awake and have breakfast in me and dressed and all that stuff by like 9am and it's just been really hard for me to say i'm not much of a morning person it's just been really hard for me to like. You know, be like up and present you know, instead of just rolling out of bed, and like really high, you know that makes sense, so it's I need to just. Yes, keep that alarm for every Tuesday I just set a reoccurring, one on my phone and just get into the habit of having to wake up earlier than i'm used to on that day, I think, is what I gotta do yeah."
416.0,Provider,"So what what can we, I mean, can I problem solve with you and help you in a way, I want to make this work, so not so it's not all 100% on you, if there's something I can do, if you do need to go into another group or whatever."
8776.0,Patient,"He I think it's really it's just. The time like at 9am because Tuesday is like always my day off that's like the restaurant workout is closed so like for me it's like my almost like a. sacred day or something or it's like that's like my guaranteed day off and that's probably why i've been having a hard time kind of like getting up and moving super early because that's like my Saturday, or you know in my world. As far as scheduling um so yeah I think that's also why i've had a hard time attending those because back when I was unemployed, you know it wasn't hard like it's just you know fitting in. Work and just yeah hanging out with girlfriend and just you know, keeping up on shores and you know just the general life stuff. Has it's been kind of exhausting like just adjusting to like living here in Nevada county just as far as you know. Trying to cross all my t's and dot all my eyes and stuff so certain things like slip through the cracks I guess then group therapy has been one of them, so yeah, but I do understand that it's I need to take it more seriously obviously so i'll have to. yeah. I guess i'll just have to yeah."
416.0,Provider,"Okay yeah that sounds fine um so. You you've been talking about some of your struggles with Nevada county lately how, how are you feeling about that."
8776.0,Patient,"um. I think it's just i'm still just adjusting you know i'm like I think. growing up here, you know. And then leaving for 13 years and coming back and it's like you know all the the scenery is still the same, but obviously like you know. The people have changed and just the world has changed so i'm like seeing. This my hometown for different perspectives and like from a customer service point of view it's like."
416.0,Provider,Different if you've changed to right.
8776.0,Patient,"yeah exactly that's so true I was way different when I was 19 not not significantly different, but yeah obviously like i've grown since then so. um but yeah I mean that was that's why I like brought up hanging out with Jared yesterday's because that's the things that I need to start doing more often. Instead of just like pretty much the only time i'm in town, like in downtown about a city is when i'm like working so like that place used to be like a fun place for me to go and see my friends and stuff and like go and get some food or. Now downtown to that a city is like it's like a chore going there, instead of it used to be like a fun place, so I think that's. weird I don't know like so I guess what i'm getting back to is that I need to like you know, specifically like call up like some of my friends and like set time to like hang out with them. yeah and then it'll make this Nevada county feel more like home, you know. Being around people that I care about like yeah."
416.0,Provider,Have you seen any of them.
8776.0,Patient,"yeah yeah I mean I saw Jared yesterday and I actually ran into. Four of my friends, I like a Park, it was really ran I was like running an errand like yeah I got to see them for a little bit so. it's cool like I still have friends from like high school that are you know they live in the you know general areas just you know we're all adults, how we all like jobs or partners or you know what have you. So I don't get to see him as often, but I think that part of that too is that any duck reach out like to the friends more often, because you know. Like set a date or a time to like yeah hang out with them and then I feel like I said i'm repeating myself, it will feel a little bit more like home, I think."
416.0,Provider,"it's like is it hard to do that with. With the is like, are you spending so much time with your girlfriend that you're not getting that balance or what's happening."
8776.0,Patient,"I I think that's the chase yeah and I also I don't wanna I don't want to spend so much time with her that we end up getting like burned out on each other, you know, like I. I think it's good to like have changed only have like a day or so like or you know, like an evening every once in a while, where we're not hanging out like she understands that like yeah. So we're working on that too and that's just something i'm just gonna be like i'm just gonna go hang out with so and so another friend for like a couple hours and working out later yeah so far that's been working like yeah."
416.0,Provider,"Okay, good. um so. ups and downs mood what tell me what's going on what's on your mind to work on today."
8776.0,Patient,"I don't know I mean. I feel like relax right now, you know, like, I mean because the spot i'm in my room, which is my rooms, been a really important place for me lately just because. it's it's reassuring to know that, like, I have a place that i'm not going to like have to move randomly again in a few months because I just moved so much in the last year. um but yeah as far as like ups and downs it's mostly just work stuff like I just I need to like what i've been trying to do is just like physically move slower and like take deeper breaths so I don't get caught up in the like. You know whirlwind of busy restaurant stuff. um."
416.0,Provider,yeah it can be a hectic.
8776.0,Patient,"pace yeah and well I also I started working a couple shifts in the kitchen making pizza there too. yeah because, like it's just like a thing, where it's like just a couple days a week they'll have me like you know toss the pizza in the air, which I learned how to do like a few years ago, like like worked. In a lot of restaurant pizza jobs so anyways it is kind of falling like throwing the dough in the air and like you know, making food like that way less interactions with the customers, obviously. So yeah I think switching that up a little bit has been kind of cool you know it's messy hot work but it's also like yeah less than interactions with customers because that's been like a major stressor for me is just how. Like the general public will just randomly interact with you in this really bizarre really unpleasant way and, like wow like."
416.0,Provider,You just get a lot of rude people are.
8776.0,Patient,"Basically yeah like. yeah yeah and or just like a like a lot of like communication language gap barriers, because there's like a lot of. folks from like Spain, live in the general area i'm like we've they work on weed farms and stuff like trimming. um so it's kind of wild it's on what this is totally rough guests number but it's like almost like sometimes like 30 40% of our customers. they're from Spain, so like culturally it's really different and like you know the language gap there's really weird and it's not like they're not like. Bad people they're not like those aren't really the rude ones necessarily sometimes they are but that's been a bizarre thing because there's like a lot of. like an influx of a lot of like Europeans i'm not like whatever like I have no control where people will move or why but it's still strange thing like okay didn't I don't remember that being a thing because it's totally wasn't like you know back when I was a teenager so."
416.0,Provider,yeah interesting.
8776.0,Patient,"yeah so I guess that's also part where I was talking about like adjusting TV here, too, is like yeah there's like a whole new like immigrant culture here that's like that was pretty interesting like ago."
416.0,Provider,And it's connected to the wheat business.
8776.0,Patient,"yeah yeah there's like. yeah it's like also a lot of like the Humboldt area and stuff too, I think I don't know too much about it but. yeah it's just there's a lot of cannabis that has grown in this general area up here and. I don't I don't really know the origins of it, but for some reason, a lot of like people like to go to burning man like from Europe, just kind of caught on to this town and knowledge, a lot of them live here now like okay it's burning man people from Europe that's. Not the town I grew up in i'm not like upset about it it's very bizarre if that makes sense, like yeah. So that's also you know, like I said part of adjusting to living here too, but. Honestly yeah like I told you last time we talked so like I went on a really beautiful walk over to the park, the other day kind of impulsively and was just like smelling the. Post rain like Moss and leaves and stuff so there's a lot of like beautiful things, and it is really quiet here so there's like a lot of like there are a lot of perks of living out here too, so."
416.0,Provider,Did you grow up like going rafting and stuff because you're right on the American aren't you.
8776.0,Patient,need like the yuba river.
416.0,Provider,Oh yeah.
8776.0,Patient,"But yeah I did a lot of like camping and stuff when I was a kid and yeah when like swimming it like leaks and stuff. yeah so there's plenty of nature to. enjoy out here, which is cool it's just tricky finding the time to do it to sometimes just you know busy with work or on my off days left to like you know run errands that I didn't have time to on a date so they were to them. yeah so it's just important to like find. Those moments, you know where I can slow down and like kind of. enjoy my surroundings or try to just like clear my head. yeah i'm just trying to build that in."
416.0,Provider,"I mean do a lot of your the got the friends that you were talking about wanting to reconnect with a little more do did they do that kind of stuff too, because that would be a good way to see them and combine it with some outdoor time."
8776.0,Patient,"yeah yeah definitely Jared has a dog named rosie he takes her on walks and. yeah they're actually know you mentioned it. My housemate know he has this beautiful like ozzy shepherd dog that's like. Really smart that he got recently I got to take him on a walk around the neighborhood the other day, which is really nice, just like it's a quiet. afternoon surrounded by trees just walking this nice dog so i'll get to like watch him more often i'm sure now that I like gotten used to it know how to put on his harness and stuff so yeah."
416.0,Provider,"yeah So those are some good ways I mean you know, the thing about it is like you said you're really busy and it's really about having to schedule it in right like actually make time for it, because otherwise you won't be able to."
8776.0,Patient,"yeah I was just thinking about that before we you know connected here like yeah like actually like choosing a day and a time like to do it, rather than. yeah rather than it just kind of randomly hopefully works out sometimes you know yeah."
416.0,Provider,mm hmm.
8776.0,Patient,cool cool sounds good.
416.0,Provider,Maybe a goal for you.
8776.0,Patient,Totally.
416.0,Provider,"I might be good. and So that and then last time we talked you were also kind of still getting you had your insurance stuff squared away, you had your provider, but you were still working on kind of getting caught up with appointments and all that good stuff."
8776.0,Patient,"i'm i'm set now yeah I got my I got my car back pain and sertraline refills from my doctor and i've got a trial set from her too so yeah. I haven't had any issues with that recently, which is really nice it was like a very confusing stressful chunk of time for me, but yeah seems to be working out."
416.0,Provider,"Nice. Okay. Well, what else."
8776.0,Patient,"I don't know um. My my friend carolyn like I haven't talked to anybody about this, but my friend carolyn texted me like I don't know a week or two ago, so my friend john Mars he died, like last year. And yeah we used to be like a band together for like years and we lived together for a long time and we kind of. We didn't have like a falling out like like we didn't like have any like big argument or anything like that we're just like kind of drifted apart, you know it's definitely still friends, but I really like. hadn't like seen him or like really interacted with him very much except for just occasionally seeing him around oakland. And yeah that happens, like. During the pandemic and I, there was no service for him or anything that I knew of and like it just kind of. I don't know I have grieved a little bit and processed it, but I guess what i'm saying is my friend carolyn just texted me like last week and was like. Oh john didn't die from a drug overdose he died from a heart attack, just so you know, because you have the same heart condition to this is dad. But it was just I mean I just like I don't know how how I felt about that because I was like well it doesn't really change the facts that. That mean he's dead either way and I just like had kind of a weird narrow like a weird. image in my head of how he died and it's just kind of like I had to like maybe like paint a picture of it to like. be able to cope with it, and then, my friends, just like yeah I did a different way and I was like. I wasn't like upset because i'm glad she communicated to me, and she the tone of the text was very sweet, and she was like I just wanted to let you know, so you can maybe have some closure. I was like well, thank you for like letting me know and like you know, giving me that information but. I don't know I just I felt."
416.0,Provider,It sounds like it did the opposite of closure for you.
8776.0,Patient,"A little bit yeah I kind of was like I really wouldn't it doesn't really make much difference like to I mean I guess it does, but yeah it kind of like reopen something that I just kind of didn't even have much of a experience. Even bloody initially died like months ago. And then I was just kind of like moved on from it and kind of a our like all right, like that happened that was fucking weird and it sucks but anyways, I guess, I just wanted to get that off my chest to somebody because I just still still feel weird about it but i'm like. yeah. That was kind of a lot."
416.0,Provider,"But i'm sorry that's I mean it yeah it sounds like it really, really brought it all back up for you."
8776.0,Patient,"And like like I said it was like when it happened, it was just like. It was just like a weird time because I was just like super depressed because of the pandemic and being unemployed and all sorts of weird shit going on in my house back then in oakland and I just kind of like didn't really. I didn't really like it is in fact affect me in the way I thought it would because maybe I just had way too much other shit going on in my wife at the. Time just kind of move past it without really. Fully dreaming about it, or something I don't know so that's just been like this can."
416.0,Provider,See you're having kind of a delayed reaction to it.
8776.0,Patient,yeah.
416.0,Provider,yeah it's just a really experienced that grief.
8776.0,Patient,"It just that just kind of pops up occasionally you know, like it's not like. Something that's like super heavily weighing on me, like all the time, but you know i've lost like a lot of friends over the years, too, so maybe it's like. It was just like hey I don't know. I just."
416.0,Provider,Are you. Are you doing anything to kind of. Like to honor him or.
8776.0,Patient,"um I mean I listened to the music that we've recorded every once in a while and that's kind of fun um but yeah maybe I that's a good point, you should do something. yeah. yeah. yeah trying to think of something."
416.0,Provider,"rituals are important in grief they're really, really important and I definitely strongly recommend if you can. some type of ritual to honor him to say goodbye to speak your piece to him."
8776.0,Patient,To call that's a good idea yeah.
416.0,Provider,yeah something something special.
8776.0,Patient,"yeah cool yeah i'll think of something that's a good that's a good suggestion, thank you."
