Was weird is um. i've been like you know, the first couple of days, I was on it, I noticed like a slightly rotation, while sleeping like i'll be in a state between sleep and still awake going something touched me or like, if I have dogs like if the dog with my. career my leg or something I get highly irritated him, I cannot get off we like.

I can just watch my my wife watches. Watch those types of shows. yeah. You know, he comes out on. This man. So he starts, you know, usually I get kind of like I get overwhelmed like because his his anger kind of fuels mine, so I feel like a little emotional myself I wanna I want to say shout out like no way."
527.0,Provider,Right.
6750.0,Patient,"yeah no but um I noticed, I was handling pretty good I didn't let it like get to that boiling point in my head. Like that usually goes on all kinds of crazy happens in my head, while he's doing that and I didn't really you know it was like down like to say i'm on a level 10 I was probably down to like a six maybe a five."
527.0,Provider,You know.
6750.0,Patient,"So I noticed a slight difference in that um yeah so I mean. everything seemed normal only thing i've been focusing on this week, we got done with my wife's birthday party on the 26 everything was really fun there we had like. A low rider type of. Party I had all the decoration how all these like big banners of like old school cars and stuff and she liked it a lot. Good yeah so we did that. Like turned out well now just getting set up for Halloween is want to have more family come down for Halloween. I think i'm like the only house in my neighborhood celebrating Halloween. Like where's the spirit, you know. who's gonna who's gonna try to do outdo me starting next year I come crazy with it, you know. i'm sitting here, looking around, but then I think some of the neighbors like i'll walk heard like a kid crying. Too scary because I got like a it's like a skeleton guy. bag and you just. treat it as like a which, like this and she's like all boned out. And yeah you know, in the spider webs and then I got like the lighting. To like I got everything on the spotlight so. slowly and little weird but. yeah cuz my neighbors that come around the neighborhood and they always walk, this is a walk me. Okay, because there's a lake nearby so everybody's walking I see a lot of people, you know this nice that's nice it's Nice. Just for one kid away only. Like traumatizing kids. toning down just a little bit that's funny yeah. there's this huge spider that i'm going to get it's freaky looking for really big spider pick it up and put them on this giant web that I have in the front so. From that either. yeah."
527.0,Provider,that's fine. that's fine yeah. So how are you and your wife doing sounds like are you guys working on things talking more finding time to talk more.
6750.0,Patient,"yeah we actually talked yesterday, we took a US day, but we were talking at same time so. We talk. We talk i'm more i'm more fiscal with her now I mean you know, like, I noticed. Was hugging her. You know kind of tending to her needs more like you know. We will see if, like we hold hands, we test. stuff I usually don't do that I feel like. angry in my head anymore to like. Like I don't want to do anything now i'm just like. You know i'm participating so um yeah we've been talking a lot. Right now we're just talking about i'm probably going to take over the arm, because my mother in law needs ihs ashley's in home care taker. So I have my mother in law is it's in her sister's name or sister hasn't been over here how long. you're doing your duties taking her to her dialysis taking here. And do this and prepping her will she doesn't do that so i'm like i'll take it over out i'll do that. i'm not working at the moment, so let me, you know handle that i'm pretty much doing it anyways I. males and help her out with a lot of things, so I have no problem doing that. So we just been working on trying to switch that over and over so she's going to be all this stuff actually selecting free money so there's no. that's not good so. yeah so we're just going to switch it over."
527.0,Provider,sharp I was gonna say how I was gonna ask if that was going to cause a conflict of any sort with.
6750.0,Patient,"him I don't think she she has really nothing to say about it, you know. Right now she's like you know. In a bad place, one of the owners of apartments that she's living in selling the apartment and she's probably not the move, and she just got a new hoeven and her husband takes care of his parents and they've been living in that apartment for years. So many years and they're like. That on a fixed to rent but they've never up their rent for how many years, so they didn't live in there. And it's because they never fixed up the place they never fixed up the apartment and now they my father in law, been working over there, he just fixed up. The bathroom and everything else, and now they're selling i'm like wow really so now she's like stressed over money and it's that so. You might find it, I mean you know she does. Well, she needs to talk to you. About because somebody needs to take care of her and she can pay for nothing so i'm not. too worried about it."
527.0,Provider,"yeah yeah yeah well and it sounds like probably letting your wife manage it, you know with. Her sister versus you know you trying to stay out of it as much as possible, I guess, as the in law. yeah yeah."

They would take these guys would come by from Ireland they're in college and they will come out here in their work with this movie company and the young kids you know, in the early 20s apologize, but the way they talk I wasn't away. All right, you guys are so straight Irish folks man. You know i'm not like the stereotypical way Irish guys talk to you guys talk like you know they're they're from. There were pretty cool some alive, they were from. I forget whether it was. Really out there, but it's amazing to see. I don't think a lot like. London, like the copy like you know when it comes to like clothing lifestyle, they can be a lot of what British folks too so yeah I can imagine always want to go there, Ireland London. I would want to go there and Spain that's like a big. Okay let's for me to go to. yeah the first place, if i'm going to go to Europe first one, the same. Tokyo Japan. Domestic why don't want to go I didn't want to go to New York New York is like one of the places i've been wanting to go to since I was a. kid I like so. yeah definitely. travel plans. travel plans and. This i'm trying to get my wife on board she's never really traveled too much sugar to Hawaii I got my mom's simple life. Those are all my mom's family all live in Hawaii in a while. And I got somebody somebody cuz other so I took her in the kids out there, we went twice, with all the first time I took her out there, she loved it she. that's nine ever yeah she was always like in the Bay area. Much you went out there are actually people are so nice. to worry about nothing you know she's. Constantly locks or car make sure it's like before she leaves you know, like why you have to do that well, not even even the park your car they won't even do that then. i'm like. Everywhere else in the bait you know that's not in the Bay area is. Hella cool. yeah cool Nice, you know depending where you go, you know it's it's very pretty tough. So people. You know a lot of everybody want money and things like that you know. So no love no live around here so. You know the you can see it so. I said everywhere else you're fine on stresses like they do."
527.0,Provider,"yeah. yeah. Okay, good, well, you seem like you feel like you've got a little bit of weight off your shoulders to. Alex you feel like you're you can take a little bit of a breath and and you know think through things for yourself and feel a little more. You know, regulated, I guess, to."
6750.0,Patient,"yeah that's that's very true for like I mean literally like we need to unlock my shoulders because I used to be a lot of tension in my neck. thing, it has been with stress on. And I think like like really cracked cracked my life, all the time and. I can do it don't worry. I don't usually on tried to but i'm going to one time i'll just. A couple days ago I just turned my direct mail correct or woke them up, but then my nexus loosen up. And i'm like wow like. I, like my nexus better and I don't feel so tense and I call it crunchy like my my feels like. A weird and how like not just feel like everything's lose I can move it around. that's to do with just the stress and the one those are doing so yeah I was I just there's this one thing, and you were talking about this in the last meeting group session floating floating floating on and i've been seeing that. That of that phrase i'm assuming that I can movies. As long as i'm listening to and even talking about it in my drug classes, I take a. second chance they're talking about floating you know this lady was like no I kind of tree life by now like. i'm at the MGM grand in Las Vegas and i'm in the pool in the lazy river and I just flow I don't pay attention and nothing, and I just you know. And I just and I do my thing i'm like I want to feel like that, but I mean that's that's kind of how you know I went out just just float on this don't fight the current."
527.0,Provider,i've been in the water.
6750.0,Patient,"You get just you know the navy seals and get dropping the water, a lot of them by Kathy a rescue because we try to make it current it's like don't go with her and just float I feel like that is a life metaphor. find it so now that I have that that kind of in my mind, a lot right now just floating. yeah for relax I mean like I was nothing to really fight because it's probably not going away, you know i'm so wanting to control everything in my in my home that. You know i'm just gonna end up making myself a mess and my family and mess up the same. sex or make sense to just kind of let it go and just see what develops because i'm so worried about the future and I think that. I mean, it needs to go this way for good things to happen, you know it doesn't things develop naturally well themselves, I think, with proper guidance and you know structure yeah but I don't have to be like on everything else oh did it this way, after the on the desktop here. And then oh yeah like you know I. All I said I just know I actually they're constantly want to like get away from or dislike you know cancel it. So all that all my life right now it's just let it let it let it be let it go, you know."
527.0,Provider,yeah yeah and that's that's sometimes hard to do just to kind of ride ride those waves. yeah. ride those waves say times.
6750.0,Patient,yeah you know it's trip is when I was a kid. By fear until those days we've been drowning. i've always been like kind of scared of water. When I go in the ocean. I don't go for it all.
527.0,Provider,yeah.
6750.0,Patient,Keeping everything like you know don't go past my chest.
527.0,Provider,yeah yeah I mean that's a little far you know.
6750.0,Patient,"i'm gonna go. yeah exactly and that's that's you know I kind of like I don't know if it's an Epiphany I thought, but like i'm like maybe that's why. i've always had the dreams of drowning things like that, because I don't flow I don't know how to flow, you know just in general in the water period i've never like I would try and panic is. This something that I can't control the water, you know, water is going to do what it's going to do. I think that's like a huge thing for me i've always as a kid been scared even when I go swimming pools and i'll go with my friends, my friends in the water things like that i'm. Sorry, get the heck away. Like if one guy comes to. push. If I can't reach the bottom and my friends are swinging on like. And they used to think they think that it was funny and I was sitting there, like in there would be like a don't get Alex and i'm like no. Right and they got on the odd panic like out I would. Do something to save on life and that's just makes sense because I was so nervous in the water. Is I can control it and that's like this is like water this life is like water, you know, let it do what it's going to do. To take you down. yeah and that's that's exactly how I feel a. lot of sense yeah i'm just working on that trip and on everything so much. that's what I do is I usually trip on everything. So."
527.0,Provider,"Who better about that good well i'm glad to hear that for sure so. I know it just it's just. Giving yourself some grace and patients to allow and some time to work through things, and you know get the medications figured out and and you know continue just improving on communication and setting boundaries and yeah it's just all a process that takes some time and. And you know we all want that immediate quick fix but that's not always. not always. The case when we're trying to change old patterns and behaviors that have been going on for a while."
6750.0,Patient,"And that's what i'm working with with my mother counselor. we're trying to work on communication my communication has been horrible. that's. The next step understanding, you know the boundaries and then there's communication boundaries or communicate ways of communicating you know assertiveness there's that. You know, rigid and there's there's like you know passive aggressive. yeah I think what how I am i'm very passive aggressive. Because I just fit that criteria, just like i'm like oh that's and that's what I do is I don't. Obviously sarcasm I use, you know, a really cool sometimes. You know I don't really notice i'm doing that you know it just comes out that way. I do leave it to learn behavior my mama mama would do that. But um I just I see myself back to like and I don't want to say it's going to burn up communicate better. And more effectively converts. You know, huge thing I don't realize i'm doing people on. like that. yeah i'm thinking i'm being Nice by saying that, like that what else is going on my head is like ratchet ratchet."
527.0,Provider,"To me, that just seems like the best way to do it, but now that's."
6750.0,Patient,"Still, not a good way to do it. So yeah you know work on communication also I need to. I have to send a sign over these wait not waivers but i'm. from other counselor so I need you."
527.0,Provider,know a release of.
