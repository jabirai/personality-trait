You would I correct that say your dad did die, but then he'll be like Okay, well then where's my dad or just let him."
760.0,Provider,I. Think. You do you are you considering putting your kids and to see his child psychologist or something.
15653.0,Patient,"You have that reset yeah there will be starting, probably in a few weeks. She wants to meet with me first we're just. inundated coming out to my house and Luke and seth separately so it's really nice. And I think there."
760.0,Provider,"I think what I would do is get like a make a list of questions, and you know and just just to give her that information so that kind of gives her something to kind of work with and start with. You know."
15653.0,Patient,that's so sad makes me think of all the people that did go.
760.0,Provider,Perhaps he's relating that because maybe he knows somebody or he saw something on TV or with or somebody that he knows that that happened to I or somehow relates that so.
15653.0,Patient,yeah pretty smart.
760.0,Provider,"yeah, so I would just like I said, make a note and talk to talk to the psychologist when you when you meet them. Let them know because you know you should have some time to kind of consult either before or after. So Jacqueline here talk to me about your habits, how you managing all the stress and the anxiety and worry what how how, how do you think you're progressing with that, what are your strong points and what are your weak points with managing that."
15653.0,Patient,"So my strong points are that i'm able to get through life with my kids, but I feel like i'm not doing the best that I can so I need to really then that brings on a sense of guilt and depression, so I don't know."
760.0,Provider,"So what are the, what are the parts that you're not doing that are not all you can what specific kinds of things."
15653.0,Patient,Like spending more time. More time with my children.
760.0,Provider,Okay.
15653.0,Patient,"I feel like i'm always cleaning the House 24 seven and if i'm not cleaning i'm taking care of them, and if i'm not taking care of them i'm cleaning."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so it's this constant chores like being a mom and taking care of the chores."
15653.0,Patient,"But I don't like I don't know I need to like ruin my schedule and stuff to. see my mom's cooking broccoli or kale and. I just need to be more routine I hate routine see even change, I guess change gives me anxiety. Like overwhelming when I said routine that felt overwhelming but it's not as overwhelming, as it was before, before anything just I would have to just sit still I couldn't move because the. feeling overwhelmed so much."
760.0,Provider,"With seems like you already feel you seems like you already have a schedule, because you said you're kind of go back and forth cleaning cleaning the House and caring for the kids so you kind of already have a schedule. Do you think the cleaning helps you kind of cope with your feelings is that something that helps you manage anxiety, maybe."
15653.0,Patient,"Know anxiety when the House is dirty and like. To me, the House is always dirty it's not even like the way I want it and then instead of like. Cleaning all the time i'll clean like. It could be hot so much cleaner my house and so much organized, but I don't know I just, then I get stuck and then I just clean like. I just like disinfect and surface clean and stuff like that, so I don't know it's just I don't know what it is, I know that it's not going, I know that I can do, I feel like I can do more, but I just get this hope or sense of anxiety man I start to think and then."
760.0,Provider,"So what kinds of things do you want to do for to deal with that better deal with that anxiety what kinds of coping skills, would you be you have any idea what."
15653.0,Patient,"I want. more productive time with my children. And so, if I were my mom says like don't worry about the cleaning, but I feel like she's a very clean person. And I get stressed out because not my house see if it was my house i'd be like Okay, you know the dishes are dirty and I can do that later on. I feel uncomfortable leaving here and so it's just it's you know I got to get it done now or my mom I don't know if I revert to being a kid because, when she was. When I was younger, we had to clean, every day we all had our true I had it my chores since I was five years old. And we all had to clean every day, and then on Saturday we had Saturday cleaning so she I grew up pretty like everything had to be really nice and clean stuff like that, so it gives me anxiety and I think it takes me back to that time. So, then, I want to, and then I sit around and then like ponder off stuff why waste time. And then, like I don't know. Do you, thank you, thank you."
760.0,Provider,"Well, I have another question for you, because i'm trying to get to to. Something that maybe you could add to your list of coping skills to better manage that, but do you do you think that it's true that it did take the time to like. I don't know take the kids to the park or read a book together or do a prep together something as you say, productive time with your kids do you think your anxiety would interfere with that."
15653.0,Patient,"It works, yes, the park would. I don't know why I get overwhelmed at the part so Lou. He can only stay at the park for a little bit and said he just throws a fit every time, leave and it's kind of hard with both of them. So I have to be totally fixated on Luke, and that means leaving set by himself, and I feel uncomfortable I get uncomfortable like you know he's going to hurt himself. or because Luke if he wants to go into one direction we're going that direction if we don't he's gonna have like a full on sludge freakin not Minoan full fledged will just start hitting me and like throw themselves on the floor. kind of because temperature engine This is like well yeah I guess."
760.0,Provider,Because i'm getting his way. yeah. That sounds like another conversation to have with the with the doctor when. He or she gets her.
15653.0,Patient,"yeah the we're working on it at school, you know his behavior she came with really violent behaviors. I don't know if it's sustained after a head injury that he had the head injury that he sustained in CPS. But he was never my baby who's never mean like that he would get irritated or if he, like if he didn't want you to sing or anything or talk to him, he just put his hand over your mouth. But he wouldn't like hit you and hurt you. So I don't know if it's like something like you know you get a break a dream fix your eight years."
760.0,Provider,"yeah that would be something to check with the doctor but it's also possible that. You know kids deal with traumatic things and split up of mom and dad and that kind of thing too so again, I think it would be helpful for you Jacqueline to just sit down and make a list of everything going on with your kids so that you're prepared to talk to them."
15653.0,Patient,yeah.
760.0,Provider,"After the psychologist so that would be one thing there so so you would not you would. be helpful to you what kinds of. So what kinds of. activities would not create anxiety in you, that would be more enjoyable for the three of you, your your two boys in yourself to."
15653.0,Patient,"Like. Like. I get stressed out like how many take care of my kids. Like financially, because you know, I was like I said numbers. yeah it made 7000 a month net so it's like I took that home. And like to go from being a nurse to being on welfare it's just hard stresses me out around my own home. So that's a big stressor like. And then I don't do anything about it and then."
760.0,Provider,But your mother is supporting you but uh You say there.
15653.0,Patient,"As you said, yeah but I can't stay here like this is not a. place where I can stay, I have to leave you know, on the weekends just in order to follow the rules."
760.0,Provider,Oh wow.
15653.0,Patient,we're telling everybody like i'm living here like it just feels uncomfortable sometimes.
760.0,Provider,"And where do you go on. weekends, when you leave."
15653.0,Patient,"My sisters or family's house is or somewhere. Oh, get out you're not cute come on get out i'm having privacy time I have the door closes and he comes through the this little door it's like. its own. Little closet that leads the outside, to the inside and he's just opened it up and you're sitting there looking at me he's so cute I love my kids. Okay, go seth out."
760.0,Provider,Please.
15653.0,Patient,they're so used to being with me all the time. yeah they're amazing like that's. Then I get excited because then I get overwhelmed and I don't do nothing and. Then i'm like oh you're a loser parent.
760.0,Provider,"These kinds of. Can can I stop you for just a minute Jacqueline. When we sit and stew with these kinds of things you know these kinds of worries. You know your your housing situation and your employment situation is not something that you can like fix right now in the moment. I think kind of like looking at life in terms of stepping stones, like you, you are at a certain location in your life, I understand that that it was really shocking to you and difficult for you to go through the divorce that you went through. But to consider to sit and continue to think about it and ruminate in it is just going to further your anxiety depression and it's going to make it harder and harder to get out of the hole you're in. So I kind of would like to use this session, if you're willing to kind of focus on some concrete things that you can do to start with some baby steps right now to get you. get your some of your anxiety and depression lifted a little bit and start making even just small improvements, even if it's just spending more time with your kids something for you to feel positive about is important. Is that they sound like something, because you said you want to spend more productive time with your kids. yeah so would that be a good goal to kind of start with."
15653.0,Patient,yeah i'm sorry I started to space off spending more time with your kids like what did you say.
760.0,Provider,I was saying that when we. Have you have you ever heard of mindfulness Jacqueline.
15653.0,Patient,No probably not maybe I have but I don't remember mindfulness I think I learned it in mariposa but I can't remember.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, because what happens when you're depressed and anxious and feeling traumatized by what events in life we sit and we still with those negative thoughts those negative emotions and this this. spiral that creates and every time I continue to think and feel these things it just gets bigger and bigger, making it harder and harder for me to do the things that I want to do like find my own place get get employment those kinds of things. So one thing that I wanted to talk to you about. Today, would. Be to start looking for some. small things that you can do to address that that so the worry isn't just like constantly going through your your thinking and your brain. causing more and more anxiety."
15653.0,Patient,"yeah Nice, probably to do that."
760.0,Provider,yeah. And sometimes when we have a lot of obstacles in our life but it takes a while to get out. And you kind of have to take like break things up in little.
15653.0,Patient,Little practice.
760.0,Provider,and work on this piece. This piece in order and then move on to the next piece. Is that something you want to do.
15653.0,Patient,yeah sure.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so mindfulness would you like to try some mindfulness right now."
15653.0,Patient,For.
760.0,Provider,"Let me, let me see. Do you have space is your or your kids settled as far as you know. Because i'd like to do like a maybe a five minute meditation with you to kind of teach you a little bit about my meditation."
15653.0,Patient,Okay.
760.0,Provider,"And I want to, I want to. mindfulness is. It can be a meditation but it doesn't have to be meditation it's it's basically a way of living. it's it's not something that people typically learn how to apply 100% right away. It is pretty simple, but our thought habits and our emotions often keep us from are we forget and kind of fall back into old ways of thinking and feeling but mindfulness there's there's two main course to mindfulness being in the present moment. And not worrying about the past and not stressing about the future and then letting go of judgment. judgment of self judgment of others judgment of situations or the way things should be or or all of that so that's that's the two main pieces of mindfulness and mindfulness is proven to help people learn to better manage anxiety. So, how does that sound to you. You want to give me your. You. give me your impression of what I just said or. your thoughts."
15653.0,Patient,i'm. Not to overwhelm myself kind of like and then keep thinking about it just kind of focus on the present like right now what you. want well it basically. and night to like let my thoughts get carried away. it's.
760.0,Provider,"kind of subtle it's it's not it, you know. mindfulness means not that i'm going to let not let my thoughts get carried away, but when i'm feeling anxious, or when i'm feeling worried, I say to myself. You know something like I I seem to be really anxious right now i'm seem to be really worried right now. and Because what I think happens when we get we sit and stew about. Things like lack of employment and those kinds of things. It kind of it blocks our ability to kind of calm down and think so. Being in the present moment and letting go of judgment and you're not going to be perfect at it most people aren't I know most humans, we we definitely do not live in the present moment, most of the time and we're constantly seem to be judging different things in our life so. As I said, it's a practice. So, would you like to try this you know, and it can be meditation but it doesn't have to be i'd like to try start with a meditation with you right now, can you can you rate for me, before we start your are you are you open for this or you're not."
15653.0,Patient,"You know, open for i'm sorry."
760.0,Provider,"Okay um can you rate your anxiety for me on a scale of one to 10 right now. seven seven Okay, can you sit sit comfortably in a chair."
15653.0,Patient,I don't have a chair in here but i'm feeling comfortable okay off like can I laid back.
760.0,Provider,"Are you on your you can lay down that'll work. Okay, so we're going to do. Let me see should I do the breathing one or do you think you do you think you're holding things in your body like your emotions in your body or do you think maybe breathing would think of the breathing one would be better so just want you to take a moment and get comfortable. And I want you to. Take deep breaths in. breathe in deeply. And it's going to be important to. breathe in through your. breathe in through your nose. And we're going to put our gentle focus of attention on our breath. going to pay attention to the coming in and going out of your breathing. letting go of any expectations. Simply focusing on awareness of the breath in the moment. you're going to allow your body to settle in feel the bed underneath you. arms to your side. I suppose. Again, focusing your awareness on your breathing. notice the breath coming in. And the breath going out. follow your breath with your awareness. Follow the breath, all the way in. and follow the breath, all the way out. not trying to change the way you're breathing. Just breathing in. And breathing out."
15653.0,Patient,After use the restroom i'm so sorry.
760.0,Provider,Okay.
15653.0,Patient,"chairs are like Okay, and then um do you want to start over."
760.0,Provider,"I kind of do want to start over did I want to ask you, though, before we do that was was this challenging for you or."
15653.0,Patient,No actually start starting to feel good because.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, great."
15653.0,Patient,"Well, I think about it, the more stressing it."
760.0,Provider,"Okay let's start it over there. Okay, so you're going to lay I guess you're going to lay on your bed. you're going to notice that your body is going to start to settle in. Put your arms comfortably to your side close your eyes. bring your awareness to your breathing. Remembering to breathe in through the nose. noticing the breath coming in. And the breath going out. Follow the breath with your awareness. Follow the breath, all the way in. and follow the breath, all the way out. not trying to change your breathing in any way. Just breathing in. And breathing out. breathing in. feeling the breath as it passes through your nostrils. breathing out feeling the breath as it needs your nostrils. Keeping your awareness lightly and gently on your breath. breathing mindfully in the present moment. breathing in. I know that I am breathing in. breathing out. I know that i'm breathing out. If thoughts come in as they always do acknowledge the thoughts. Without judgment and let them go. Let them drift away like clouds. floating across the sky. and bring your awareness back to your breath back to your breathing. back to the present moment. breathing in. I know i'm breathing in. breathing out. I know i'm breathing out. Each time, your attention moves away from the breath distracted by a thought of something you have to remember to do, or maybe something that's bothering you or worrying you just notice the thought acknowledge the thought. And then let it go. bring your awareness back to your breath. back to the present. letting your full awareness be on your breath. As it comes in. And, as it goes out. notice the familiar rhythm of the breath. breathing in I calm my body. breathing out i'd let go. When you bring your awareness, to the breath in this way, you are connecting the mind and the body in the present moment. The word for breath and the word for spirit in many languages is the same. So, bringing your awareness to your breath connects your mind body and spirit to the present moment. dwelling in the present moment. I let go in the present moment. continue to mindfully breathe. Following the breath, all the way in. noticing the slight pause at the turning point, as the in breath becomes the out breath. And following the breath, all the way out. noticing the brief pause as the turning point of the out breath comes the in breath. Aware of the steady familiar rhythm of the breathing. As we bring this meditation to an end, keeping your eyes closed for just a little while longer. take a moment to notice how you are feeling. Your body. your mind and your spirit. If you like offer gratitude for this time have taken for yourself to be quiet to breathe. And to bring yourself back into balance. So when you're ready slowly come back into the room. Aware of your body. Laying in the bed. And whenever you're ready open your eyes."
15653.0,Patient,"close the door i'm almost finished. Big ready go. No that's not an invite to stay go please moms on a monocle. So please be respectful let's use our respect, are you teaching mommy or Daddy to be disrespectful. You are oh wow he's mine then you're being negligent. Okay here teach him how to be good. Oh come on drawn him. sethi, can you please go set go. Please. stay there. will get you mark with you only find him. James. Can you get him a marker. No or. are asked her Allah. Hello."
760.0,Provider,i'm here.
15653.0,Patient,Sorry.
760.0,Provider,Now rate your anxiety for me after finishing that short medicaid meditation.
15653.0,Patient,"it's a three. So okay that's pretty good I was often thinking about certain stuff I like going now. Okay, so I mean I got good, though, that really felt good just thinking about what I would be doing things that are like doing. Art pottery."
760.0,Provider,"Okay. Well mindfulness can be a meditation but there's also mine, you can be mindful, as you do, certain activities as well, you don't have to meditate to practice mindfulness then like I said, the main to quiet our parts of mindfulness is being in the present moment and also letting go of judgment. So you can be mindful and wash dishes or you can be mindful and. You know eat something. or even just take a walk. So is that something that you would like to pursue a little bit more."
15653.0,Patient,yeah sure for sure.
760.0,Provider,"I have that. I have, and again keep in mind, it is a process it's not it takes practice to kind of get used to kind of reprogram the thinking. But I have a single sheet on mindfulness that I could email you. Have it saved in my computer, but I kind of want to show like this Oh, here it is. It has. Has a description of what mindfulness is. As well as some of the benefits of mindfulness which include reducing symptoms of Depression and anxiety. Improved memory focus and mental processing reducing rumination. ability to adapt to stressful situations and improved ability to manage emotions and, if I can you see at the bottom."
15653.0,Patient,there's.
760.0,Provider,"In the Green boxes there's three different for different mindfulness exercises. That I will go ahead and email this to you Jacqueline and and would you be you know it can be just five minutes a day, just to kind of start out or anytime you notice your anxiety hit a six or higher. You know there's like there's a one that's called the five senses and that literally takes like a minute to two minutes at most to do. And can help just kind of turn the dial down on that anxiety because the more we hold on to those emotions and build them it's just continues to spiral and making it more and more difficult to focus on the tasks that I know you can do does that make sense to you. So you know, starting with little steps and I like your idea of wanting to take some time with your kids and spend productive time with them. would be good for them to maybe you could do the five senses one with them. it's good for their mental health as well, and the five senses is really simple they just you name five things you see. Four things you feel, and when I mean fee I don't mean emotions, I mean like as far as touch or maybe temperature in the room, or maybe the sun, on your face those kinds of feelings three things you hear. One thing you taste and one thing you smell, and you could make that a game with your two boys."
15653.0,Patient,Okay yeah that was actually that's a good one. And that is about. That makes me happy.
760.0,Provider,"that's that's the fourth one on this sheet that i'm going to email you. i'll try to do it right after session if, if I can, if not, I will get to you by the end of the day, but I want to confirm your email Jacqueline. Jacqueline santana. 341. At gmail."
15653.0,Patient,"yeah. Are you able to are you able to write like a small little Jackie attends therapy bi weekly. or. Maybe something what we're working on, or something minimal, are you able to do that for me."
760.0,Provider,"It can be done by bright heart health I usually the there's a different department that takes care of that, and you would have to sign a release of information which is they'll help you with that as well, what have you but yes, I can send a message that you need that as well. Perfect okay. Okay, so, would you how often over these next couple weeks before we meet next time, would you want to try some of these mindful exercise."
15653.0,Patient,"i'm going to try, every day, if not like I mean i'm not gonna put like a lot of so I did my resume last week, like. Two weeks ago, like we discussed so that I got that done, I am doing assignments. i'm going to try, every day, but if I don't try every day, every other day i'm just going to try it and whatever I do I do whatever I don't I don't because I don't want to set myself up be like oh I didn't even try or do anything but. Well i'm going to."
760.0,Provider,"Try to Kim Can I make a suggestion. um there's a mindfulness walk on this sheet. But you could you could mindfully do tasks. You could literally take two minutes of time and, as you are let's say washing dishes or cooking. And mindfully in the same way, we talked about remember when we were doing the meditation we all we we focused I know i'm breathing in, and I know i'm breathing out. So let's say i'm going to make my my my son's a peanut butter and jelly sandwich I can utilize mindfulness by taking some deep breaths. And I know i'm going to the refrigerator i'm getting out the bread i'm getting the knife from the drawer and just mindfully moment by moment what i'm doing and incorporate it in whatever tasks, you have to do. So that it doesn't have to turn into this long meditation. Because I think I think that consistency, the new habit is what helps the most. Because you know habit works when we have habits that are destructive that that we're ruminating about all these. All this anxiety all these horrible things that happen and it just constantly going through your brain causing these feelings of Depression and anxiety is build build build you're doing that consistently. So, and that becomes now a habit in your life so mindfulness is a way of kind of trying to root that habit out because it's really not helpful to you and replace it with something more positive. Okay, so look for little things does not have to be a meditation, I think, maybe three times a week, if you think you can do a meditation if not we'll practice in our sessions as well, we can do meditation again next time and. Practice that. there's also a mindfulness walk. So you, you know I don't know if that's going to be something you can do with your boys, but you know it's good if you can find the time and space to maybe take them and do that. So does that sound good."
15653.0,Patient,yeah.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so so you did your resume have you have you started looking online."
15653.0,Patient,"I have, but i'm going to start looking more."
760.0,Provider,Okay okay all right. Do you have any do you have any questions about mindfulness.
15653.0,Patient,know when are we going to meet.
760.0,Provider,"Again, well, I again. it's every two weeks, but I do have some good news about that. I can now they have given me the ability to schedule my own appointments. yeah send you to care navigator I can do we're going to do that, right now, Jacqueline. The you like the 10 o'clock."
15653.0,Patient,yeah 10 o'clock fine.
760.0,Provider,"Let me see I already have on on Thursday January the sixth, I have a 10 o'clock already, but I could book you at 11 would you rather 11 or."
15653.0,Patient,11 when.
