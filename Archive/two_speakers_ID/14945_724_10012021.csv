The idea of this assessment is going to ask you questions about your medical history your psychological history your social settings we'll start off with some demographics, some generalized information.

724.0,Provider,And where are you at now.
14945.0,Patient,"Currently i'm staying at the Hampton inn. I just got kicked out of an extended stay, a few days ago, because I was letting. homeless drug addicts come over yeah. I think the capital, I thought I was selling drugs or something so yes. i'm really glad i'm out of that space, I was gonna die there if I stay there."
724.0,Provider,What what was going on there just lightly drug use or.
14945.0,Patient,i'm just. Too laid back and know what take people take advantage of mean. So I I find like. blocked watching people's phone numbers and I just yeah. I had a job delivering pizzas there's several people there that I worked with they were really like math and pills and. So I quit that job we.
724.0,Provider,know how long it was that.
14945.0,Patient,Like last week okay.
724.0,Provider,You made all the changes in the past week and the past couple of weeks so that's that's good so a lot of changes oh yeah.
14945.0,Patient,"yeah I mean. I do. know. Where my life was heading, if I can do really."
724.0,Provider,"Well, you made the right choice definitely my."
14945.0,Patient,"don't know what i'm gonna do i'm gonna still like like tomorrow i'm going to check out here, I booked 390. And I don't know where i'm going to live in, I mean i've got money. I haven't burned through all my savings yeah but."
724.0,Provider,"You were thinking about going and like impatient. Just. For now, and get some assistance from."
14945.0,Patient,"Some of my family wants me to do I don't know I mean, I guess, I don't really have to have the state insurance, but I don't. know if you just get stable on suboxone and."
724.0,Provider,"One minute they can do that stuff too, you know what I mean like. Well, they can help with other stuff you know. placement residency drought in Arizona, so I don't know what it's like, but a lot of patients that I deal with currently are in California, so the housing market is tough for like rental and trying to get it with hud and all that kind of stuff and. If you haven't started any of that stuff you're just looking at you know some difficulty, whereas like where to start you know what I mean just even like you're like the start point would be difficult. To kind of solo that you know I would recommend like Inpatient care like for sure, because they the case management can help stabilize you. If you can get certain level like if you're going to look like what a medical acute care where they can. manage you if you're having symptoms, or anything like that medically getting stable get john the medication kind of get you in place by you. 30 6090 days have some stability and then you know set you up versus you're just trying to figure out on your own you know I would strongly recommend that I really would."
14945.0,Patient,yeah let's. say.
724.0,Provider,"You need some stability right now and you're going to try to manage all this stuff on your own it seems a little chaotic. I mean you can't keep keep hopping from efficiency stays efficiency stays I mean I just I just met you, you know what I mean but you're smiling see you know it's it's accurate, you know, so you know what your limitations are right now, a little bit. Just love all the care as much as we would love to. help you and keep you here it's like you would probably benefit from impatient for a little bit and then bounce back here when you're done with this place, always be here, you know."
14945.0,Patient,yeah.
724.0,Provider,"So what. What do you think is there, like. Is there a place in particular that you've been before that's so so it's okay or. I mean you got to think like what else is going on you've you've cancelled people out of your phone you left the offense and she plays because you knew it was a trap. You know what I mean like what do we walk it into tomorrow morning. tomorrow night look like."
14945.0,Patient,"I don't know probably book another hotel somewhere. I just been working as much as I can, so I can. That that's not long term submission."
724.0,Provider,"know I mean it's yeah I mean it's not you need some some stability like right now. More than you need to you know what I mean like. You kind of you're kind of doing it a little bit at a time, whereas if you go into Inpatient you can get squared away with that and then. By sometime you don't have to worry about where your next meal is going to come from you don't have to worry about spending your money you don't have to worry about where you're going to sleep for the night. You know it's not going to be the Marriott you know what I mean a lot of those state facilities aren't the greatest but for the purpose that you need currently they would it would suit your needs quite quite fun."
14945.0,Patient,yeah. I would like to go back to sober living.
724.0,Provider,"Now, and you can do that too, you know what I mean."
14945.0,Patient,"I tried to do that about a month ago, but I like I quit all the drugs. For over a week, but I was still failing and drug test, and then I just ended up. crashing this dude's house and he had a bunch of trucks in a pit and high end."
724.0,Provider,"whereabouts in Arizona, are you."
14945.0,Patient,Right now i'm staying Chandler.
724.0,Provider,Chandler. what's the name what's the name of the facility that you went through last time.
14945.0,Patient,"most recent one, a few months ago was called on the hook it's in Mesa. And I really wasn't a huge fan of that facility ever have another place called crossroads."
724.0,Provider,crossroads know.
14945.0,Patient,Which maybe I would consider.
724.0,Provider,crossroads zombie say.
14945.0,Patient,"Like if i'm gonna go back to the place, I went to last year."
724.0,Provider,Last year.
14945.0,Patient,"cornerstone, but man it's super expensive super nice me really good insurance or."
724.0,Provider,So i'm obviously i'm not from Arizona so give me some cities that.
14945.0,Patient,i'm not from Arizona you ever would come out here to go to treatment like three or four.
724.0,Provider,Okay Where are you from originally. Missouri Missouri okay all right.
14945.0,Patient,So if i'm if I end up. moving out of Arizona like do you guys still like.
724.0,Provider,"we're we're we're nationwide so like it doesn't really matter like where you are cuz. we're everywhere at this point, you know what I mean. So. There are. All sorts incorporated. crossroads."
14945.0,Patient,"I think there's a few locations I don't know a lot about it, but I just."
724.0,Provider,"Well, I have a bunch of crossroads is nationwide to i've got one here in my state a lot of the patients that I. That I supervise or that are under my caseload come from crossroads in California and, therefore, like all over the place in California so i'm just trying to. we're just trying to find something that's nearby you. yeah so phoenix. phoenix."
14945.0,Patient,"Like 50 seconds Thomas, and I think it's the best phoenix or scott's though yeah I guess it is phoenix."
724.0,Provider,"How far away, is that from you."
14945.0,Patient,14 miles that farming.
724.0,Provider,"All right, so here's the deal man. I think you should call them. I think you should call them. Because they're not you're still actively using like on and off it's not very consistent your. it'd be hard for you to get to a like a sober house, because you know they're going to want some stability and it's it's better if you come out of a program and go. In transition into the server house they kind of prefer that that method, plus a lot of these places will plug you in to the Community and you don't have to do a bunch of the work for it. yeah I think you would benefit a lot from him actually most of the patients I deal with that have been from crossroads, they don't have anything negative to say a lot of them say that it like it saved their life they it was exactly what they needed it when they needed it. This this level of care it's like at the lowest like the assumption is that people that are coming in, are like super stable, you know, for the most part. and your housing is unpredictable your job is unpredictable. yeah you need you need higher level of care for sure. And you've already made the you know you've already taken the initial steps, because you, you want to get right so you're on the right path. And I know that this pie doesn't seem like something you want to do and there's probably some resistance so going impatient but. You will get it in the Grand scheme of things like the end the short term you're going to have to commit maybe 30 days to 90 days or whatever, right in the short term, but in the end 90 days is nothing when you start to measure it against yours right. So right now it's fox but, but you can honestly tell me that things are awesome right now for you."
14945.0,Patient,So rather than whether it was a couple weeks ago.
724.0,Provider,"yep, but it could be a lot better, a few weeks from now, if you do this."
14945.0,Patient,This is true.
724.0,Provider,"You know what I mean. So that's my recommendation, like I don't know like if we're going to be able to get she like the level of care that you that you need and if you're. yeah I mean if you're struggling now, you need impatient. And this place is open 24 hours you should hang up with any call them."
14945.0,Patient,yeah. resistance.
724.0,Provider,"And I know why he resistant man, but. it's hard to commit to that you know that process right now, you probably weren't thinking about it when you signed up for this tonight, but i'm telling you right now professional."
14945.0,Patient,All i've been here for my. Parents and my. sisters like go to rehab.
724.0,Provider,"Give me all the things you've been hearing from the people that care about you, is. What we have. that's not the worst thing that can happen when somebody is addicted to drugs right with your family still cares they're still with you. Know pretty much you to get right."
14945.0,Patient,yeah.
724.0,Provider,"So at least you have that support network in the background, you have saved insurance, you know what I mean like you might as well use it. You know, make it work for you a little bit. Go get plugged in get some stable housing for the next month to three months, whatever it is, whatever they allow you to do. take advantage of the case management happened help you get housing when you get out you'll get a couple a couple months of clean time under your belt come back to a place like this, when you're a little bit more stable and then you're off to the races man like. Right now, like. you're not you're not a good headspace right now for this level of care, I mean we can do, we can do all this kind of work and set you up with scripts but. Like you're in and the fallen off because it's just not it's not going to hold you accountable enough, and right now is what you need is structure and accountability and. you're not going to get that through telehealth today to three times a month you're just not you know what I mean so. I don't want to waste your time I want you to get right, you know that's why i'm in this business i'm in the business of putting myself, out of a job every day. Because I want people to get right Okay, so I don't know you, but I give a shit enough that I think you need higher level of care and then come back and talk to me in a couple months."
14945.0,Patient,makes. yeah.
724.0,Provider,"So do that for me, I want you to call this place, I don't know time is central time where you're at so."
14945.0,Patient,10 times you guys it's like a 30 year.

I know I see it in your face you got that that resistant pool you're halfway and you're halfway out man just just commit to it call them, you know, let them know that you want help that you're willing to do whatever it takes, you have the insurance you got all that stuff just just go. No quit playing games. yeah yeah do that for me. All right. call that number. And then we'll be here, you know what I mean like you can. You can contact us when it's time to transition out of that place and into sober living and then you need medication management. This place will be glad to help you out man for sure you can ask me again, you can tell them that it was the guy that gave you a hard time and all that good stuff but you know generally I care about you man, and I want you to do right so.

Whatever they tell you to do do it. Your family will be happy and then six months from now you'll be happy you'll be in a much better place you just got to put some hard work, and right now all right."
14945.0,Patient,"yeah, no, no."
724.0,Provider,"don't think about it too much just act, you know. When we're in recovery or when we're an active use we don't really spend too much time thinking and trying to be analytical right we don't do any of that shit we're just trying to get get right or get what we want, when we want it quickly. And right now you're resistant a little bit don't just like everything else right now act on it call them and then follow up in the morning, all right."
14945.0,Patient,Okay.
724.0,Provider,"alrighty and good luck keep us posted. All right man. Good luck well. For transcription That was the attempt at he buys like social assessment for Ian Barnard he needs my recommendation is higher level of care he's still actively using multiple substances he's not in a stable setting. To be engaged in this level of care he's just not. Know stable housing and he's in and out of efficiency, hotels just left the last efficiency hotel because they essentially turned it into a trap House just using constantly he was asking me there. is used bezos. methamphetamines opiates alcohol all that stuff within the last two weeks, and probably and probably more recent he's somewhat of a poor historian he's disorganized. he's resistant to and patient level of care, but that's the recommendation that's what he needs at this point, he says to high risk for this is current modality i'd like this recording to be saved for risk management, for the time being, and I suppose i'll send an inquiry. For him to seek higher level of care he's going to contact crossroads and he was instructed or encouraged to do so once he hung up the phone with me. No further action."
