386.0,Provider,"Thanks um I hope that's a good thing. um yeah nope I don't see that it's been sent out, yet I will put another request in there, for it to be sent. But it's a possibility it's a possibility that they may want you to good to go down to the lab prior to. Having it being mailed out and that could be what the holdup is um. But right now what it's doing is because of the multiple no shows it's reducing your prescription order to a two day supply, with no additional refills I have. Your next fill up your next appointment, on Thursday, so what I can do for you, this would be basically last chance to get you over to group. Is I can do a two day supply with one additional refill. To get you taken care of but I definitely am going to need those surveys done and then your bps evaluation, which is tomorrow, so what i'll do is i'll do the two day supply and then, when you go to the bps evaluation, I can send an additional two days supply for you. Okay, and. That way we can get medicated and that way you're not miserable i'm not fun so. I will call over to discount drug Mart in the next five minutes, and then you should be good to go from that point on again it's a two day supply so it'll be for quantity of four. With no additional refills But then when you go to your bps evaluation i'll confirm that appointment has been went to and then i'll send in the additional two days. After your home to visit Ohio. yeah I wish."
