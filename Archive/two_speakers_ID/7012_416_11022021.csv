416.0,Provider,"I am just thank you for saying that I am just so amazed by you it's like you know what's amazing is that you always knew there was a part of you that knew yourself so well. When I first met you, you always knew that once you got to the point where you didn't feel trapped by the methadone anymore. That. That you were going to kind of launch. and There was nothing that was going to get in your way with that you, you knew yourself, while you tuned into it and there was nothing that was going to get in your way and here you are."
7012.0,Patient,"Well i've been trying to expand more on my spiritual side, obviously with everything going on it's not. it's not ideal for that that self exploration exploration because of how busy i've been but i've definitely tried to make it a priority. To. Be more open minded and just kind of. Like be more woke I guess and. You know."
416.0,Provider,"there's sort of a season for everything you know. There was a time when you needed to tune in to yourself a lot more heal and yeah stay really focused on that. And that was an important season in your life and now you're in a different season, where maybe what you're looking for a little more now is a little more balance I where you don't totally lose that piece, but it doesn't it isn't the sole priority anymore."
7012.0,Patient,"Well, this thing it's it's it's hard i'm juggling like seven things right now. Like I counted them, the other day, like it's a lot, but like you said i'm trying. I, the only way I wouldn't things is if I just go and do it so i'm trying to learn a work life flow balance doing my best. Like we've said before, I might have work a holic tendencies. i'm trying my best my roommate is here to help me regulate everything and he's like a goodbye and that's why I chose him as a roommate and he kind of helped ground me."
416.0,Provider,This he did a lot of the same job stuff that you do.
7012.0,Patient,So he runs a weed business.
416.0,Provider,Oh interesting.
7012.0,Patient,"makes a weed isolates but not like weed but it's like cannabinoid isolates better, more medicinal like CB CB N and CBD and stuff."
416.0,Provider,So it's not. Your chemist roommate.
7012.0,Patient,"For you, is perfect exactly."
416.0,Provider,"A weed chemist of all people, that you. found and."
7012.0,Patient,"i'm good at finding people. it's one of my strengths i'm not good at, and I am learning to acknowledge what i'm good at and trying to find people to tell the nitty gritty that i'm not good at. i'm trying to learn how to be. My own like manage people I guess it's kind of stressful but i'm learning."
416.0,Provider,"yeah you know I mean give yourself some grace there's going to be. it's a new thing, and you are masterful at brave the brave taking on a new thing so that's your thing. yeah but it's tough for you sometimes to be patient with yourself, while you're in that learning curve."
7012.0,Patient,that's what i'm learning is patience is I need I need to work on my patient with other people to.
416.0,Provider,end with yourself.
7012.0,Patient,"And I need to work on communications with other people is the thing it's like I need to be transparent. Because i'm used to just doing my own thing you know just being focused on me so now, I need to learn how to expand that because people are just like my sister's boyfriend. i'm trying to help him and he's just aimless you know i'm trying to get in to see a therapist and i've got I got him to get him it's like I feel like a parent I feel like i'm parenting people I help them pay rent and it's like you guys owe me money sorry i'm not a bank."
416.0,Provider,"So what what is it about you that feels like you have to take on that role for them, especially when you're so stretched."
7012.0,Patient,she's my sister.
416.0,Provider,But he's not your brother.
7012.0,Patient,"Well, I was helping my sister and my sister is the main. You know i'm trying to help help sit, you know I love my sister. yeah i'm gonna help. are now any wrinkles that might be needed."
416.0,Provider,"yeah that's fun to watch I think it's I think it's great that you're helping your sister and when you're so stretched thin and you're still kind of getting used to this new schedule, I think that it's fantastic i'm not trying to say just you stop. But really pay attention to the impact it's having on you. Because you know if it has too much of an impact on you, if it really starts to affect you then you're not going to be helpful to her anyway right."
7012.0,Patient,to your point.
416.0,Provider,or yourself or anybody else.
7012.0,Patient,"i've definitely been neglecting some self care, just like Because of all this stuff going on, but I feel like once i've settled in it's pretty new like. it's been within the last month since we've seen each other, you know it's like been, but we can have since i've moved so it's like i'm trying to. situate my room trying it's an entrepreneurship department so i'm trying to put everything together about some new furniture and i've been to Hollywood and like I went back and trying to do it myself, because I need to know how to do this stuff."
416.0,Provider,"mm hmm. You have some pretty high standards for yourself you've gotta you know do all this work, plus you have to you know get good grades Plus, you have to furnish and you know move out and work all this and help your sister and, like all this stuff so."
7012.0,Patient,Just be aware it's hard to find good employees and that's why I tried to do it myself.
416.0,Provider,"Yes, it is so, what are your options, if you can't find good employees and you realistic can't realistically can't sustain doing it all yourself. Then, what are your options."
7012.0,Patient,"I mean, I can always i'm planning to if everything falls to pieces, just focus on the modeling and catering stuff. But I can at least pay around."
416.0,Provider,"Okay. You know so identifying your your biggest priorities and putting the majority of your effort there and then the other stuff is like well, it needs come along i'll do what I can, with the rest right, but having a little more grace with the rest of."
7012.0,Patient,"It I know it's like here i'll look them up right now i'm I have a runway coming up on the fifth and then my fourth i've been movie screening and then. I. asked. me look at the dates. How long are, that is when you do there's a lot, he said."
416.0,Provider,well.
7012.0,Patient,So they're like three hours they pay $100 an hour.
416.0,Provider,it's great.
7012.0,Patient,This. Is it's a really good food they have like a couple hundred thousand dollars. which it.
416.0,Provider,I mean this stuff is so exciting it's exciting for me to hear about.
7012.0,Patient,It.
416.0,Provider,I know I need my pretty. we're freezing a little. Sorry. Lately yeah it's a little funky.
7012.0,Patient,Sherlock.
416.0,Provider,"yeah maybe, do you think it might be better yeah. me Daniel."
7012.0,Patient,My computer i'm sorry. hey that's okay. yeah there's a lot of things to do. So i'm just like setting everything up. Like in a month or two in my head it's like in a month or two once everything's in place.
416.0,Provider,fi movie.
7012.0,Patient,My computer it was close my laptop was. closed and I just started doing.
416.0,Provider,"Okay, that was a moment but. All right, so. So yeah you've got a lot going on, so it's about finding some balance identifying some kind of your priorities, putting most of your effort toward those priorities and then. Finding things like opportunities to sort of I always call it stealing time like steal time for yourself like something just randomly gets cancelled, there you go you got some time right and. Using that time, not to like you know faceplant into social media but. Using that time to like. Do something that makes you feel good."
7012.0,Patient,Literally I haven't been on my instinct I don't use i'm not big into that kind of stuff like i'm just i'm doing it i'm not fucking cloud chaser.
416.0,Provider,I love it. never heard that before cloud chasing but that's so accurate.
7012.0,Patient,"Wait if I had time to post about this stuff sure, but it's like i'm actually doing it i'm not trying to like brag. If I mean that's always who had been it's do this and do something right, you know what I mean."
416.0,Provider,"that's right, and you are. You got to feel proud of yourself with all of this going on."
7012.0,Patient,"it's. it's not necessarily pride, I guess, I feel like that's kind of. arrogant way of putting it, but I know you meant, I know that you didn't mean it like that it's, just like in my head. i'm just. Trying to stay busy and trying to figure out my own way, I guess, and going and trying to go with the flow. chart it figured out along the way."
416.0,Provider,Have you run into a situation yet where you're. i'm guessing you probably have. It where you're surrounded by.
7012.0,Patient,yeah. Not not heroin or anything I don't surround myself with people doing my opiates. But like coke or I can't have been my stuff like that have. spine.
416.0,Provider,is struggling at all.
7012.0,Patient,"yeah I mean i've experimented myself with like mushrooms, I guess. mushrooms. And like plant medicine, but I like to Michael knows I don't want to a trip out and like take too much, I see the Morris tool as of. late, I want to be out of this reality. You know what I mean."
416.0,Provider,"mm hmm yeah you've talked about the micro dosing thing i've had a bunch of people ask me about that and I always think of you like Oh, I wish I had Daniels like expertise. Right."
7012.0,Patient,"Well, quite honestly, the epic to see his. own for, especially for this era energy activity within it, for people that are depressed that don't you know you know the advocacy ready for SS horizon so in our eyes was only like 40 50%. So I really like being in La it's really cool to see the evolution of plant medicine being integrated within Western medicine. And so you really interesting time and, like, as you probably already know, like this is literally like the most culturally turbulent time that we've seen in centuries so it's very it's a very interesting concept to be a part of it."
416.0,Provider,"Yes, I mean I feel like i'm a part of it, too, just not MLA, but it is. It is. Very it's significant."
7012.0,Patient,I feel it's very significant and a lot of people don't understand the implications of it.
416.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
7012.0,Patient,And i'm i'm just going like I said turn and go with the flow and going along with the ride and looking at the epic disease and i'm trying to treat it as something that can benefit people in the future.
416.0,Provider,"Right not something to run away i've been doing this whole this whole series in groups and you don't get the group as much now but i've been in this whole series in groups lately about feelings like emotions that gets stuck in you. And how anxiety and panic are often. that's actually what they are, like the shaking the panic it's actually emotions trying to express like pent up stuff is trying to express and. So my theme has been about being in right like what happens if we lean in and thank thank the difficult things. Thank you, emotions Thank you unpleasant sensations because you are important, you are such important signals your important information and if I push you away i'm not getting critical information about the world around me and about where I am right. So when we lean into those instead of push them away, and I feel like that's part of it too right is seeing seeing the world and the things that go on with us in our interactions with the world as critical information. That helped us survive and help us function in the world, rather than placing a judgment on it one way or another right. Which is kind of similar to that's what I think of when you talk about the micro dosing piece is like it's a tool to help you tune into things if you use it that way, and some people use it, the opposite way to avoid things to push them back. Exactly it's all in like how you approach it."
7012.0,Patient,"mm hmm I agree and there's a lot of these fake there's like I I would only ever do something that has clinical trials and studies within it, and I tried to do the smallest amount possible first you know. To get the desired effect, I don't want to be gone. Because that's not the goal."
416.0,Provider,Right. I mean you learned firsthand better than anybody that doesn't help.
7012.0,Patient,It doesn't work that's not that's not what I want. yeah.
416.0,Provider,I want to such a practical person.
7012.0,Patient,"And I yeah, but I understand that. My with my disorders, my mind my neuro chemistry, especially with this, the drug abuse that i've done it's probably out of whack and these medicines can actually help me if I use them correctly."
416.0,Provider,"yeah yeah well and you are one I don't you know you're not one to get your information, your research from YouTube you actually."
7012.0,Patient,give you that link.
416.0,Provider,I use it all the time.
7012.0,Patient,it's all right.
416.0,Provider,it's amazing.
7012.0,Patient,"I gave it to my so what they did was they they hacked. This girl from my cheat sheet active standard I don't know how to pronounce it. she's like a computer science. genius and she had every database of every like hospital every place that is doing clinical trials research papers, like the works and so whenever it's uploaded to one of those places it's uploaded to her server to as a PDF file."
416.0,Provider,than anything.
7012.0,Patient,"And it's like, why are you charging and trying to capitalize on information vital information that can revolutionize our society."
416.0,Provider,Right yeah instead we make them dumber but through YouTube right.
7012.0,Patient,"I know right you when I watch YouTube stuff I literally just take you with a grain of salt in late. Summer yes Okay, this makes sense, but the rest is bullshit."
416.0,Provider,"Right. yeah it's not that everything on there is wrong, but it is like, please do not make this your source of. vibe nation."
7012.0,Patient,There there's a literal person curating this content and they already have their internal biases that are in place that they don't even realize probably that they're projecting onto this. So you need to do that with research papers and clinical trials to. Look at what. What source and where they're getting their information from any to be a long line of misinformation.
416.0,Provider,yeah and who. Who pays for the study I mean all of that right yeah exactly. that's all are you still in statistics.
7012.0,Patient,yeah. Here i'm doing stops right now.
416.0,Provider,And that's that's one one right. yeah.
7012.0,Patient,i'm in stats and psychology right now.
416.0,Provider,"Oh well, perfect they both. nicely."
7012.0,Patient,"I know, like, I noticed that they kind of coincide together, I didn't realize that till I took them i'm like oh we're both talking about samples and we're both talking about population sizes and we're both. yep yeah i'm like oh. yeah Okay, then."
416.0,Provider,Did you ever read that book that I suggested to you that i'm thinking fast and slow.
7012.0,Patient,I haven't yet honest.
416.0,Provider,I mean you've been a little busy so it's understandable. you're gonna love it you're gonna love it so much I just yeah.
7012.0,Patient,it's fantastic that bathroom slow. mm hmm and then I looked into scholarship stuff apparently I can't apply to scholarships until i'm a student at the school.
416.0,Provider,Until you've been accepted.
7012.0,Patient,yeah exactly.
416.0,Provider,yeah yeah exactly I ran into that to my son.
7012.0,Patient,"So I think I have to wait till next like once I start. Making the fall and then do it, I."
416.0,Provider,"get it, I don't think you have to wait until you start, but you have to wait until you know which school you're going to wait you've been actually accepted."
7012.0,Patient,"yeah so i'm waiting for cow sale as accepting to, then I was then i'll work on that I still need to work on my research i'm working on a research paper right now i'm bipolar disorder. i'm just. Using that website. I tried it I I wrote it on the. whiteboard for all the 18 year old kids in my class and he didn't know."
416.0,Provider,They do they need to know.
7012.0,Patient,"What you're. Trying to teach them all right again psychology i'm always the one night trying to prompt the conversation, and like. herding sheep."
416.0,Provider,I love it hey. I read your paper when you're done with it.
7012.0,Patient,yeah I can send it to you.
416.0,Provider,If you if you want.
7012.0,Patient,"I would love to yeah if you want to read it, I will definitely send it to you."
416.0,Provider,yeah.
7012.0,Patient,"To me it's due on the 22nd, so it should be done by the end of the month."
416.0,Provider,Great I mean.
7012.0,Patient,"i'm. i'm trying my best to do a PA formatting me it's my first research paper and it's probably not gonna be perfect so don't judge me too much i'm doing my best, though."
416.0,Provider,And I am not even the tiniest bit worried APA I think a piece pretty straightforward.
7012.0,Patient,It is. yeah I. Just need to work I just need to work on the citation formatting and everything.
416.0,Provider,"don't you have, I think, in mind, I haven't written a research paper and a long time actually. And when I bought my new computer the the word program that I have actually you can tell it which format which citation format to use, and then it kind of does it for you."
7012.0,Patient,"Have i've just been using this website called night site and then it's like with a K K and it see it.com and. They so what one of my English classes taught me about it, and it has like a pulldown list of MLA and APA formatting and then you just input, the right fields right name of author website. And then your rates it into the APA format in for the bibliography."
416.0,Provider,"This i'm going to sound really old for a second in my generation, when I was in college and Grad school, we had books APA format, but we had to let you look through it, I have it in. I know, things have come a long way."
7012.0,Patient,"it's a new it's a new age and that's, the problem is that there's too much information. Not enough people that are able to actually understand. that not everything you read online it's true."
416.0,Provider,yeah I mean even just sorting through it is so tough yeah.
7012.0,Patient,Oh yeah takes a certain type of temperament and a certain type of mentality to be able to viably understand what's going on.
416.0,Provider,It takes an awareness of confirmation right like yes your brain has lots of biases like how are you going to at least be aware of that.
7012.0,Patient,"Well, what I try to do is like I tried to acknowledge my biases and then. Actively try to go against them."
416.0,Provider,"Right well that's why in science, we."
7012.0,Patient,We dispute things.
416.0,Provider,Instead of proving them. seek to disprove them.
7012.0,Patient,"Because it's not I mean like you said, like within a mathematical proof like it can be proved improved improved improved, but if it's just proved once, then the theory is not sound. So they look for the disapproval, not for the oh it works for all these situations. yeah but if it doesn't work for one then it's not a sound theory."
416.0,Provider,yep science and math are so cool I love them.
7012.0,Patient,All right. I know me too.
416.0,Provider,"So you have a lot going on you're trying to balance it all you're in this sort of like new season in your life, and so, if I can give you an assignment it's to give yourself some grace. Okay, and remember to remember to that everything will come it doesn't have to come all at once, you don't have to do everything at once. sure. Your priorities and let some stuff go all right."
7012.0,Patient,it's hard for me.
416.0,Provider,I know it is.
7012.0,Patient,"I want it all to happen, right now, and like it to be in place already, and it's like I have this vision in my head and say we need to do this now. But. Not everyone wants to they they like the vision, they just don't want to work. and say all right well. Why do I have to do it all."
416.0,Provider,"yeah. it's because you're willing and because you put that level of pressure on yourself to do it, but there's there's that's dangerous territory for you a little bit right."
7012.0,Patient,well.
416.0,Provider,as strong as you.
7012.0,Patient,"Will, what do you see happening as like a potential negative like I don't see myself relaxing but right."
416.0,Provider,"Now so worried about relapse i'm more worried about just your overall mental health and well being right when we when we exist without some balance when we're unable to. You know, find some genuine downtime, especially when you go from really having a focus on yourself and your mental health to such a crazy schedule in such a quick. Such a short amount of time it's it's jarring and we do need to adjust, so I know that you're ready and you hold yourself to these very high standards, but just give yourself a little graces you adjust."
7012.0,Patient,Just literally everyone's been telling me that lately. yeah you're not the only one.
416.0,Provider,"Okay, good."
7012.0,Patient,"i'm sorry it's hard for me it's like i'm working I need to get this shit done it's like. In order for me to. chill and relax like that I need to put everything in place first. So that's why i'm doing this, but I still need a feasibly pay rent and people like my sister and her boyfriend want me to help them get back to work, and all this stuff and it's like Okay, then. answer me when I text you to confirm the dates do the itinerary or I can't trust that you're going to do it right, I love you, but I come on. Yes, Sir, I found I found some other people that were going to do instead."
416.0,Provider,"Okay, I mean I think that's reasonable right."
7012.0,Patient,"me too. I told them that i'm the word and if there's more stuff that comes up, I can get them in but so. You need to show that you're punctual and I on time at night out it."
416.0,Provider,"that's right, and you know I we create in a lot of ways, our own our own road. We forge these things, so you can help them as much as you want, but they have to take these steps in order for things to actually occur right, you can be responsible for their behavior responsible for your own."
7012.0,Patient,"you're sorry the saying goes, you can bring your horse to water, but you can't make it drink."
416.0,Provider,"Exactly exactly yeah. Right. So, keeping all of those healthy lessons in mind as you move forward and giving yourself a little Gray. sure that you're building and a little a little you time.

And I. Just at this point in my life i'm just so over that and i'm just living my most authentic self because I could care what other people think and try to match their frequency and if they don't get it, they don't get it they're just a sheet."
