298.0,Provider,"Okay, so. Our program is, you see a therapist once every other week on zoom. And that is. that's one part of our program another part of our program is group therapy group therapy it's done one hour once a week for the first month and then you can request to change that to twice a month. After that, after the first month if you keep all your appointments, you can make that request and then for anytime you want to make an appointment with me to write prescriptions diagnosis, I can do those things for you and you can make a one on one appointment with me. And I let me tell you what happens in group therapy group therapy is not really a time to share a lot of personal things as much as it's a time for skill building. therapist and myself are there in group with eight to 12 other people on zoom and the therapist will present some topic, whether it be shame or boundaries or whatever it is that the therapist. brings us a topic, and then I am there the whole time anytime anybody wants to chat with me they can and that's so that is done, that is our program those three things I can't take group therapy out it's all together.

You know somewhere where you go where they take you off drugs, even though I wasn't on drugs, I wanted to maybe I thought, maybe they had group therapy, where I could go and sit and listen. Because. to learn how to deal with my insomnia, because of this, and they put me on. They put me on a benzo. I have no idea why they did, that I was there and they put me on. Of course, now I can't remember it not value and they put me on."

14776.0,Patient,"announced clonazepam and I was coming you know, and I was so desperate because my family was really hurting from from the Lol thing. And I was kind of desperate, so I didn't really question it until after I left and I thought well at least i'm sleeping you know because it helped me sleep, but then I realized what I was on. And I. didn't want to be on it anymore, and so I was on it i've been on it for about six weeks and now i'm trying to get off of it, and I am I am going to somebody who is I don't know if you've heard of the ashen method of getting off of. getting off of lenses I don't know if you've heard of her. Her name is heather Ashton she's from the UK and her her, she has gotten a lot of people off by putting them on value and then taking them down from value going down very slowly."

298.0,Provider,Okay. Did you have any hallucinations or delusions.
14776.0,Patient,"I mean, but my main goal first, before I do anything is, I want to get off the benzo because you know, like i've said i've had. A couple experiences, through my life I had one about 20 years ago where i've always had a little bit of trouble sleeping and my doctor gave me down mean I don't know if you've ever heard of it. domain is a benzo and I didn't know what it was at the time and the doctor didn't tell me and I didn't bother to ask and it helped me sleep. And I took it for six years and then he I didn't know, and I just they stopped making the the brand name and the generic didn't really help me, so I stopped stopped at cold Turkey. And for a year after that I think you can imagine what happened to me and I really didn't know it was happening to me until I actually looked online and found heather ashton's. You know, whole article about you know transferring to value and getting off valley and but by that time it was too late for me to do that. So I have been, and then the other time, I was on Volume I realized that I was not addicted to it, but I was dependent on it, so I myself, I decided to just I had value and I decided to take myself off of it which I did."
298.0,Provider,Okay. What do you.
14776.0,Patient,"And sorry, my main goal and what makes me really upset is the fact that I did this again, you know with the because I was kind of desperate with the. Lol problem and I can't believe that this therapy plays put me on on this on it."
