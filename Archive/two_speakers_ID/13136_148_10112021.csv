148.0,Provider,hi Courtney i'm gonna change your name on the.
13136.0,Patient,Oh yeah I sorry I don't know how to do that i'm on the iPad so.
148.0,Provider,"Okay that's Okay, I was like who is this. You, how are you doing."
13136.0,Patient,"i'm doing good i'm in Hawaii now, so you know a lot yeah, a lot has changed that's kind of why I took like a little break from bright heart just because I was trying to kind of get settled and everything um but yeah i'm here in Hawaii at my other mom's house and. i'm feeling good about it, you know it's it's definitely a big difference between this environment and my other moms and in California. It seems kind of very neat and. So that feels good um. So yeah that's good and yeah. So."
148.0,Provider,happy to talk to your X.
13136.0,Patient,"um. I I have been I was that your dog. Sorry it's okay. um I have kept a little bit in contact with him, mostly just because I had kind of left my car there in his possession, because we had kind of made this agreement that he was going to kind of watch over it, for me, i'm till I have to go back to California, in February. Because I have the breathalyzer in my car, so he was saying how I basically had asked him, you know, can you please look over my car and make sure it gets it service every month i'll send you the money for that. Because I didn't really trust my mom would go or remember the day or you know not be able to pay for it with a card, because she doesn't really have a debit card that's, the only way, you can pay for it. So um you know we've been kind of keeping in contact in terms of that but, as far as like our like you know, like relationship wise I haven't really been like i've we've both just kind of. I mean I don't know there's been ups and downs like since i've gotten here. He was the one that took me to the airport and everything too, and so it was and I, like you know, obviously we both cried when I left and. You know, we had we would talk for a couple days and text and be kind of like loving towards each other and like facetime and stuff and then. And then he would just kind of switch up out of nowhere. So, but as far as like my feelings towards it i've kind of just learned that like there's nothing I can do to control the situation, and right now, the best thing to do is to really just focus on myself, so you know i'm not like. obsessed with the fact like Oh, I have to talk to him, you know every single day, or you know, like he has to talk to me or text me i've kind of like allowed myself to not really. Like rely on that or be disappointed when I don't hear from him, you know, so it kind of feels good just to kind of like take a step back. Even if you know, the future is uncertain um who knows really what's going to happen, but I think that yeah like I said, I think that, right now, the best thing to do is to really. focus on healing ourselves for."
148.0,Provider,"Lately, so it sounds like you're in a really healthy place with it. yeah yeah. And I have to say what a difference than you from the last time we talked because it seemed you look really good you sound really good. yeah see."
13136.0,Patient,"Oh yeah definitely I I know you know I just I feel like in that environment at my mom's house, I was just really drowning in that, and so. You know I I do feel like I knew that in my heart that if I was to change environments and just to kind of have some sense of normal normal see. Back in life and just you know, the whole thing of like leaving so OCD and getting anxiety triggered and being around my mom and everything and her negative impact and stuff so you know. yeah it's been great and just being here, obviously in Hawaii has made me really happy to be surrounded by nature and to have days, where like I can go snorkeling like I went snorkeling last week with my mom's partner with like my step mom here and. It was just so beautiful, like you, they had bought me a snorkel here and like just being underwater and just kind of feeling like okay like you know nothing else really matters right now seeing all the beautiful fish all the little yellow fish, you know and um. well. Okay i'm sorry um so. You know um yeah anyways it was it was so beautiful like I saw a turtle and it was like so special. To me, because I like swimming like right underneath me and I just thought it was like wow it's like a very spiritual kind of thing for me um. And yeah just you know, like being out in the sun being like I feel like the sun kind of I need like vitamin D a lot, I feel like I struggle, maybe with like. A seasonal depression type of thing, so I feel like sometimes if i'm not getting enough sun or not being outside enough um it's like I just feel like i'm like you know so like lifeless almost and then so when I get like the sun, I feel like well i'm recharged like I feel energetic and. I just feel good."
148.0,Provider,makes such a huge difference doesn't it.
13136.0,Patient,yeah for sure.
148.0,Provider,So when did you get there and who I.
13136.0,Patient,"um my flight was September 18 I believe. Okay, though yeah so about a month i've been here about a month, and the first um so I didn't I haven't gotten the vaccine yet and. I didn't get a test in California, so the first 10 days that I was here to quarantine um so you know that was like a little difficult for me, but it wasn't too bad I was just still like happy that. I was here, and like I had my space and stuff but then, you know as soon as I was, like i'm free like it kind of was like Oh, you know there's so many more things to do so, I got really happy about that and then um. I. Okay, so. let's see I kind of like wanted to like have you lead the conversation and ask me questions, because I know, sometimes i'm just like Oh, and then you just like sitting there listening um so I don't know actually maybe i'll just i'll just let you ask the question."
148.0,Provider,"Whatever feels. healing for you, I mean sometimes it's really important to let everything out that's coming up for you. So did you was there, something that you wanted to share with me."
13136.0,Patient,"yeah okay so okay um alright, so the first like 12 days, almost two weeks that I was here, I was obviously important to for the majority of that and I was home, and so I didn't leave at all, so I obviously did not drink at all during those times. And I felt really good and I felt really strong. um and the day that I was kind of like let loose and I went out to go job hunting, I went out and I had. I went to like the second place, that I went to a restaurant and I got hired like on the spot. Well yeah so I was like oh like you know i'm so proud of myself and everything and. I feel like at that moment, I should have just been like wow i'm so proud of myself, I, like you know this is maybe like a reward or something for being sober but. Instead, I was just like okay I got the job done because I was supposed to go out and be job hunting for like a couple hours. And I was kind of like Okay, and then you know just like being like out on the town and like being alone, I was just walking by and I saw like a lot of people. You know drinking having a good time and it looked fun and and I feel like in those moments like when I see people laughing or having fun or smiling when they're drinking. For like a split second I like try to convince myself like Oh, you know that can be me like I could be having fun too, and that looks fun, you know. And I need to like train my brain to be like okay obviously there's gonna be people out there that have fun. When they drink in can control but that's because they control themselves, you know, like they're not getting absolutely wasted or having to continue to drink after they have one or two or creating chaos in their life, you know. and destruction and just like losing everything you know, and so I. In that but in those moments like I don't really think about all that it's not until like after so it's like time and time again, I I tried to think oh like you know, this could be a possibility, and then it just turns out that I proved myself wrong every single time so um. So yeah so that day um. I had drank and it was kind of like it was kind of like the you know the universe, it was almost like kind of like a joke, because it was like. Everybody was like oh like let me buy you drinks and the bartender was like Oh well, from the Hawaii you know, like drinks on the House and. All this stuff like I wasn't paying for it because I didn't have really any money when it got here, so it was kind of like. ironic, you know, like, and I should have just stepped away, but of course me like having that tendency I couldn't handle it, so I did that day and um I kind of flipped it together like I didn't really. don't think that day like I. Like got caught or whatever by my by my parents like that don't think that they knew. But then I started work, so I have like that, one day, and then i'll say Okay, you know I kind of had a little wake up call like I was kind of like huh you know, like. The have a memory, but it's kind of fuzzy but it wasn't like I blacked out, but it was still kind of fuzzy and I was just like oh man, you know, like I should eat feeling again and so. I was, like all right, you know, like i'm gonna be i'm gonna just take that as like a misstep and then just continue to go down this path. I started working at this job and I started befriending a lot of people obviously and i'm also to like at this particular job was at a restaurant, and so they had like a policy among you know the perks of working there like they had a discount 50% and like. It but then at the end of the day, they would have what they say a pow Honda so it was kind of like if you get off work and you're you know over 21 and you can get a drink for free. And so. That I, and I feel like I kind of knew like I feel like oh God okay this isn't really a good thing for me, you know, like this, maybe isn't the place to work, but I kind of just battled between my head and you know, like. The good and the bad and I weighed the pros and cons and I just thought you know, maybe I could be stronger but. every night, it was just like you know I would see my co workers and stuff and I just wanted to sit down and talk with them, and they have a drink and then. I would get like a ride home from my female coworker because I read like five minutes away driving and I got off me later i'm like 930 or 10, and so my parents were already in bed, so I would get rides home. and I had lost my ID so I lost it I lost my purse Okay, so I think okay actually I was wrong, now that i'm recollecting everything so that first time that I did. I did kind of get caught because I had lost my purse so that day that I went out and got that job. And I just been kind of walking around and then I ended up somewhere I don't know and I left my purse somewhere or somebody took it for me to be honest, I don't really remember um and so yeah so I lost everything I lost my ID my social security card everything in my wallet. My phone. And just a lot, and so, but the job, where I was working they had already taken copies of my ID and my social so they already knew, you know, I was over 21 and so that was kind of like. Then, that was like the only place that I could really unless they were to like us somebody to get it for me so anyways I started, you know getting rights whole and stuff and then like. I would just like like I said, like, I mean after one like it's like I have this voice in my head it's just like keep going keep going and so. Highly would like my coworker I asked her a couple times and she gave me rides home to stop store. And then. Last week. i'm gonna go out and my. My mom loves to my mom is here now so she's like doing dishes from Senegal my room um. So. My gosh I just lost track of my mind. Okay, so last week here on the Sierra club that's good um so yeah so last week, I had gone to there was a birthday party for one of the girls that my work. You know I knew that there was going to be drinking there, and so did my parents, you know so they didn't really want me to go, but I have promised them i'm like no just let me go, let me go. Because this is like my one chance you know to just like actually meet everyone outside of work, you know and. It was like at this beach and. I had gone and I was so I asked my mom for right there, and she refused she didn't want to take me, so I just kind of said okay well. You know, whatever i'm going to take off walking then and i'm just going to go find a ride, so I took off and I ended up getting picked up on the road, you know, I was hitchhiking but by a woman and. I will never really get in the car with a man like that I don't think but. anyways um she was like oh Where are you going I was like well this birthday party at the speech it wasn't that far, and she actually ended up knowing the girl so she was like okay i'll take you. So I ended up there and we ended up there pretty early it was like 11 o'clock in the morning, and it was like going to be an all day thing you know. So I ended up there really early and then like immediately as soon as I got there, it was like there was like. 412 packs of like the hard salter's which is like my choice drink, you know I don't really drink like wine or I don't really drink a lot like hard alcohol I kind of just like the little filters and stuff. So anyways it was like hitting the jackpot you know it's like whoa like there's like it's like for me it's like oh like gold, you know and so. I started drinking, those are not first like it was okay like for a little bit, but then progressively throughout the day it just got really bad and I ended up really embarrassing myself I ended up like. Getting confrontational with these two girls um and then like somebody else that had known them was like you know don't be talking to them like that and kind of like almost wanted to beat me up. And I went in the ocean and almost like drown because I was so like i'm a good swimmer but if i'm intoxicated I don't have any strength really and i'm like 110 pounds so that's you know, like i'm so that was very dangerous like I could have died, I literally couldn't have died and then. I just yeah I like ended up like getting out and then I was like passed out for a while i've been now like, just like really embarrassing. Things that I did, and I really, really felt bad because, like in the moment I wasn't thinking about you know other people's. Concerns or like feelings, you know and then after the fact, I really thought about it and i'm like wow I I I think like I ruin this girl's birthday, because. You know, like, I mean there was a lot of people there, there was like probably 20 something people there, but just to have like that kind of person around. And feeling like also to like she probably felt really stuck because she was like you know. How is this girl going to get home, you know, like we're not going to just abandon her, but like she's messing this up and giving everybody a hard time and just making everybody really worried and stuff so I really thought. hard about my choices from that day and that happened last week, so that was like about four, I think, five days ago now, so um yeah so since then I. I haven't drank at all and I I did quit that job I just told them like respectfully like I don't think that this is the place for me, and I feel really ashamed about my auctions and everything, and thank you for the opportunity, but I don't think I can work here and. And like I did apologize. To a couple people that were really helping me out a couple girls that from that day. And one of them, you know, a couple of them were like understanding and they were like it's Okay, and then a couple of them, you know they didn't even respond to me so. I really just thought about that decision, and you know, of course, like being here to like the stipulation with my parents was to stay sober and they've already given me now like two chances, so this is kind of like. they're kind of like okay like you know this is kind of like the last straw like if this happens again then you're going back to California, so I I don't know like. You know, I think that I kind of maybe jumped the gun and I was just thinking like oh yeah you know, like i'm going to be friends and stuff and I really realized from the situation that. I am too weak right now to like be in social settings where I feel like i'm going to be tempted and i'm too weak to be like maybe hanging out with people my age kind of thing and like. just maybe that like right now I just kind of need to take a step back and just be alone and it doesn't have to be lonely I just have to. Like really like love myself and love my own company and hang out with my mom and my parents, you know and her like my mom and her partner and do stuff with them and just stay on track and. Get back with the counseling like I had a really hard time because you know, like I knew right heart was here too I just feel like I had been. So all over the place that I didn't really know you know and but now that like i'm clear headed and I really thought about it i'm getting back on track with the counseling I think that will really help. And i've looked into a meetings as well, here in the area, so there's one here. there's one here every day it's like a maybe like seven or eight minutes away and it's every day at noon, they only have one but it's every day so and it's in the middle of the day, and my mom said that. She would even be willing to go with me so that felt really good and i'm going to i'm going to do that as well, like really. set my mind to that and do that because. I do know that I have the capability, like last time I stayed with them last time I stayed with my mom and her partner. In their household I was sober for like three or four months, I really got my life together, I was working I had financial stability. and put the breathalyzer in my car I got my license back like I was accomplishing all these goals that I had like lost track of and just been kind of negligent about, and they are really you know. they're really good for me in the sense of like they're they're like Okay, you want to do this, like will help you, you know, like, if you want to better your life will help you in this way, you know, will take you where you need to go and. Do whatever you know, like today we're going to go try to get. My ID from the dmv and you know they're gonna. Try to help me like get into social you know stuff like that just stuff that, like my mom really wouldn't help me out with and I know that, like i'm 24 should be able to do it by myself but. I don't know Sometimes I feel like you kind of need that little push like even if you're still in your 20s. it's still kind of a hard time like you kind of feel like I kind of feel like I was just kind of like pushed into this adulthood, and I didn't really grow up like knowing a lot of life skills so. i'm kind of learning late with all this stuff but you know it's good to have that support so. I am really."
148.0,Provider,"say, if you have the support, then take it. yeah yeah."
13136.0,Patient,"yeah because I really don't want to go back to California, at least not now, at least not until February, when I actually have to go, because I do really want to just be here and have this time to get strong and. You know, and like I said, like, I know I can do it, I mean. Last time I stayed with them, I was sober for like three or four months until they moved here to Hawaii. And then I had that's that's around the time that like covert hit and, like all this stuff and I had to move and. So then, obviously I kind of fell back down that rabbit hole but um they're really good for me, and so I really want to take advantage of this and I really do want to be serious, and I feel like you know. Also to like during that time, I really thought about it and during that time I was going to in a meeting like at least three four times a week. And having that like. In the daytime I feel like really kind of like every time I would step out of a meeting i'd be like Okay, I feel that much farther into the belief that today I can make it sober because I have this huge Community that's here for me and people their stories, you know everything. So yeah that's I feel like i'm going to do that and i'm going to tell them that I want to go to one at least you know, three, four times a week. which I think will be really beneficial."
148.0,Provider,"yeah and I think that's really smart, because if nothing changes nothing changes right you do things differently to see different results, so if you just keep. doing what you're doing and not you know coping with those cravings coping with those urges when they come up recognizing the triggers what your addiction is telling you Oh, I can just have one release Lee can you just have one. And it's questions like that you need to ask yourself when those thoughts pop up Okay, I know this is a. risky thought for me, because my brain right now is telling me I can just go and have one I can just go and have fun and nothing bad will come from it, nobody will find out those are the things that our addiction tells us because it's so manipulative."
13136.0,Patient,"yeah definitely like I think I read somewhere in a book from a actually that. Like those thoughts that tried to deceive us like that, like they're like snakes in the grass like we don't necessarily look at them like being you know. We kind of like want to trust it and we want to trust that you know, like we have those like doubts like maybe I can you know, but it is really truly snakes in the grass and every time you you learn your lesson again, you know that's just plain and simple with alcohol."
148.0,Provider,that's the cycle of addiction.
13136.0,Patient,"Yes, yes."
148.0,Provider,"um so there were a few things that stood out to me when you were talking I heard I should a lot I should I should have done this, I should do this. let's just take that word completely out of your vocabulary, because the only thing that's doing is making you feel bad about what you didn't do right what you didn't do differently. So instead of I should I want to reframe that and to I can you know i've learned this is what I can do, moving forward and talk to yourself that way, instead of I should have more I always say to people don't should on yourself right it's like putting yourself down. Another thing I heard you say was that you were weak and I also want to reframe that for you, too, because you were absolutely not week. You were struggling with addiction and in early stages of recovery you're very, very fragile you're learning you're starting to work a recovery program all over again, but I would never say that you're weak."
13136.0,Patient,mm hmm.
148.0,Provider,"And then just telling yourself, you said something about Oh, I can do this, but I can be strong right. I think one that is an addictive thought to that's very risky thought if you're throwing yourself into risky situations where you know there's alcohol, where you know you don't have a lot of time in your recovery. i'm gonna say more times than not you're going to fall into a slip or relapse right. So it's not about being strong. Right it's about being smart and knowing what what your brain is telling you being able to identify it if you think about yourself as two selves one is your addictive self one is you're. recovering and so herself. If we look at your addiction and how long you've been active in your addiction that's the side of you you've been feeding for so long that side of you, naturally, is going to be stronger right now, until we get more sober time on your belt. Start feeding your sobriety more. That will eventually be stronger than your addiction, but right now in early recovery, the best thing that you can do is avoid those risky situations don't tempt yourself right."
13136.0,Patient,"yeah definitely um yeah I really liked what you said about like you know not. Not like it's not about a matter of being strong but just about being smart because yeah I think if you're smart then you're not going to put yourself in that situation. And if you're strong you know I mean you can say you're strong but everybody knows that I feel like. Not unless me, you know me like there's no i'm not saying that there's a possibility that there might be one day, where I am. I have more time under my belt like you said, where I can be around an environment where i'm like. You know what yeah you know those people are fine, you know I mean they're doing that thing, but I don't really feel like I need to partake in it and it's not like. Oh, my gosh you see that and I want that, right now, and I want to be like them, you know. But i'm so i'm not saying that there's no possibility that will ever get to that, but I know that especially I think within like the first year it's very, very important to. To be mindful of those things and to know like you know, and obviously like it doesn't have to be like I think like you know, say, like you get invited you know to an outing I don't. feel like it's necessarily like you know you don't have to be like oh like you know will is there going to be alcohol there you know but. I feel like if you just know who you're surrounding yourself with and you see their patterns or behaviors then you'll know like you'll feel the two and two together and you'll be like okay well yeah I mean you know. I see that person drinking every day, or you know, especially like or on social media though they're posting about drinking wine, you know, like obviously you'll know that person is probably going to be drinking, or whatever you know."
148.0,Provider,And are those the type of people that are going to be conducive to your recovery. Probably not probably not yeah.
13136.0,Patient,We know yeah.
148.0,Provider,"If you're trying to get sober, the last thing you want to do is surround yourself with people who are drinking."
13136.0,Patient,Definitely and that's why I like. yeah that's why also to I just really don't wanna go back to my mom right now we can milder mom because I just feel like. You know I just feel like. i'll just. go down.
148.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
13136.0,Patient,yeah.
148.0,Provider,"I also want to just remind you that. Be because you struggle with the disease, because addiction is a disease that doesn't make you weak right. I just want. You to remind yourself of that when you're feeling maybe like you're weak or that you could be stronger just know that you didn't choose this for yourself, this is a disease."
13136.0,Patient,"yeah I think like yeah I think a lot of like that negative self talk has really stemmed from. Just like over the years, all the shame that i've had and all the broken promises that i've had towards people and then. You know, obviously, people have feelings about that, when you break their promise, or you disappoint them and so obviously they're not going to be very nice about it, especially time and time again. And people are going to have these ideas you know about you and, like preconceived ideas that Okay, you know she's saying this, but she always says this so it's going to happen again. You know, and so um and like you know, maybe I have been called week in in the past, and you know, like maybe. I have been told, like you're going to be like this forever like you're never going to change, you know just very like negative things. And I tried to really drown it out, but I feel like with also to like with the disorder that is very hard for me to take that criticism and I really, really get emotional about that."
148.0,Provider,And i'm.
13136.0,Patient,"Like all dwell on that and then it's like. When I get in my negative self talk it's like I have all these voices in my head, like all the things that i've been told, and I start to believe them, and so I start to tell myself that too. So it's really important for me as well to you know i've not, I know that in the past we've talked about you know, the fact that it's not about what other people think it's about what I think about myself and I need to become. I need to become stronger than other people's opinions about me and the only person's opinion that matters about myself is mine. You know, and knowing that and just becoming so strong and kind of like having like this Armor like you know this Armor that's like you know okay you like not taking anything personally and just having this like. This growth in my mind like knowing like Okay, you know, these people are going to say all these things are these people are going to expect the worst from me, but I don't have to. I can expect the best from me, I can expect that this time I am I am serious you know I can expect that I believe in myself, you know."
148.0,Provider,yeah reprogramming i'm fat and that self talk.
13136.0,Patient,"yeah and um yeah and it's like so. I don't know I sometimes with the disorder, also with the borderline I feel like it it, it makes it very difficult to do that, though sometimes because sometimes I feel like I. Have like a God complex like i'm like okay yeah like nothing can bring me down, you know, like I am strong I am fierce you know I can do this. And then it's like and then like the next fluctuation will be like wow a very like depressive episode and like wow like I do, I even really know who I am like and. You know, like all these all these negative things so it's like back and forth and that's where I have to understand, as well as that, like, I am going to. not always have good days, where I feel like that, but those are the times, most importantly, where I have to just be gentle on myself and remind myself like. To like Courtney like you are dealing with a disorder, this is just an episode, right now, like you can feel the emotions, but you don't have to dwell on it and just try to really like retrain my mind. To think to go to a more positive place and maybe, if I have to like when I when i'm feeling like that, or maybe when. i'm thinking about people like what things you know people have said, or you know just down on myself, I think, like maybe what would really help for me is like to write down like affirmations you know, like I am strong I am."
148.0,Provider,You know.
13136.0,Patient,"Lately yeah. um I had like printed out. This like there was like 60 something like positive affirmations and i'm just like maybe not so much like affirmations but like good quotes you know to like really like remind myself and I had actually put them up on my wall and. My mom took them down because she had packed up my stuff but i'm going to print them out again. Because I was going through like saying, every day, where I would look at it. And I would before I stepped out of my bedroom door I would look at that and just have that mindset and it really did help and then, if I was feeling down i'll just go back and like read like maybe two or three or four of them.

You know you're just you're going through the ups and downs of it all, and I feel like you're learning so much every time you have a slip."

148.0,Provider,call on remembering that time different sort of forgotten.
13136.0,Patient,"I feel like that's like I had a couple of appointments to sign up. With bright heart like when I first got here, but I miss them because, like I didn't even think about the time difference and I. was like. Man, you know. um so yeah i'm definitely like now i'm like Okay, when we think about in my head and then i'll write it down, you know."
148.0,Provider,"Okay, good good um remind me what your date of birth is 0406 1997 8pm for me 11am for you. i'm gonna put you down for 60 minutes and ritual i'm. Alright, well, I think that we. Really caught up today covered. um is there anything else that you wanted to talk about."
13136.0,Patient,"um I mean. Oh let's see how my mom wanted me to talk about today with you like kind of like what I can do. To deal with triggers and like because pretty much you know my mom and your partner they've been together for like. 1516 years, so I met mandy my step mom when I was really little i'm still like you know, like 1011 um and so she's been in our life a really long time so obviously you know. we've we've all been together we've been in family dynamic for quite some time um and it hasn't always been easy with that necessarily. We used to do family counseling and we've we have like a couple things always come up. It was always kind of the dynamic of you know mandy and I fighting and then my mom being kind of put in the middle. And being tugged at both sides like when we would fight I would remember like. it'd be like a race like who would call her first you know, like would it be me or like who would get to her first you know who gets along lover he would get to the first be the one that you know, will always win the argument or you know, have the other one reprimanded you know and. So obviously as an adult you know, things have changed for sure and i'm just kind of trying to learn really to like how to work with them right now, and this dynamic because i'm. There, a lot older, so I mean you know age is just a number, but they feel like they're a lot older so mandy is like 67 and my mom just turned 63 I believe. So you know I mean to me that is older um and you know so they're they're kind of like they kind of have like they're kind of set in their ways here, you know, like they. have this routine you know and they get up every morning they go to class their little aerobics class and stuff and. But then like around two or 3pm they come home and it just put on their pajamas and then they're like okay we're you know we're just winding down and then they'll sit on their computers or mess around or watch movies or TV, you know for so long and. I noticed a lot that like when they fight now like i'm being the one that's kind of dragged in the middle of it, you know and. I mean, because now like, as an adult my opinion matters more and and what i'm fighting with either one of them to. That we all confide in each other when we have arguments or disagreements, you know, like it's always like Okay, these two and then like the you know, like it's always kind of like okay. Well i'm fighting with my mom so i'm going to go talk to me about it or my mom's fighting with my mom or my mom is fighting with mandy she's going to talk to me about it like it all kind of works in this triangle um. and also to like they have like their moods and stuff you know, like my mom my mom is on like medication and stuff for like depression and. Everything so i'm like Sometimes I feel like you know I don't know she's a little not I don't know I don't know how to explain it really without like sounding bad, but sometimes I feel like she's almost a little bit numb to a lot and. I that's how I felt to be honest, when I was on in a depressant but um mandy is quite the opposite, I mean she takes nothing she does nothing and she's very hot headed and she's very impulsive and she is kind of like similar to me in the way of like. When we get angry we get angry in the moment, and then we get mad, and then we yell and we you know my screaming yell at each other, but then like five minutes later it's like Okay, are we done like you want to get over this let's squash it. You know, whereas like my mom has a whole different approach and she's the type of person that's like if you piss her off she'll hold a grudge for like days and days not talk to you hold it all in and then she then she goes. Okay, so um I don't know I mean and like also to like i'm just trying to i'm trying to really show them, I know that they're kind of you know, right now, like they're very not. Trusting of you know, like my word or you know everything and i'm just trying to really try to just regulate my emotions and not be triggered like today we're having an issue because. mandy is saying you know, will you know it's always like what if, with her like well what if you know and like. You know, and will she needs to do this, and she needs to do that and stuff and it's sometimes i'm like just chill like. You know, like, I feel like this is triggering to me like i'm doing what I need to be doing like I told them hey I was like. I have looked into the a meetings, and I do want to go like i'll go to one today, you know and i'm like today i'm doing my constantly like i'm going to talk to my counselor i'm getting back into that, like, I know I screwed up but. You know i'm I am taking the steps it's not like oh I screwed up well, let me, you know blah blah blah through life and then do it again, you know it's like I am very self aware like you said and. I know that nothing's going to change unless something changes so i'm trying to show them that I guess and but sometimes I just you know, obviously it frustrates me when it's like. I have to just remember, though, like there is a reason why people don't believe in me and it's because I have shown people, time and time again that this is going to happen. But I always feel like you know, like when I feel really set on it i'm always like you know, like why don't you believe me just believe me just believe in me, you know, like. believe that I can do it, but that's where we've come full circle back to the thing of like you know I really don't need other people to believe in me I just need to believe in myself. So that's what I really need to work on a lot but. yeah."
148.0,Provider,"i'm you know setting some healthy boundaries on both sides right and then respecting those boundaries on both sides is really going to be. Crucial right now, as you are doing this work on yourself naturally dynamic of all your relationships are going to change right you're you're getting healthier and you're doing a lot of healing um. Have they ever been to a non non or Al anon meeting for themselves."
13136.0,Patient,"My mom has mandy hasn't but my mom has gone to al anon yeah quite a few times. yeah she is you know she has me and then she also is my brother who she very much loves both of us, but she's just she's had to watch us go through so much suffering and so much you know just chaos and and she's she's also you know, a former alcoholic so. Jesus over now for like. 15 years, so I I respect her for that a lot, you know um. But uh yeah so she's gone and she's the one that said, basically, if I want to go to an A meeting should be happy to go with me."
148.0,Provider,"Good good okay yeah i'm and again something that you said earlier, which I completely agree with is you know just show yourself some kindness show yourself some grace be patient with yourself remind yourself, and you can remind them to that you are doing the best that you can. yeah yeah."
13136.0,Patient,you're.
148.0,Provider,"on track and. yeah you know you can't. You can't gain the trust back overnight right it takes time, but right now we're just focusing on today and getting so and making it through the day sober."
13136.0,Patient,"Just today yeah. Oh yeah and that's like a huge reminder to that I remind myself and I remind them all the time is like. You know, it makes us very nervous I feel like as addicts and alcoholics you know, to think like. You know, like when people talk about three months, six months a year, you know or your whole life, it makes us very like oh like it's like this way it's just crushing down on you when you're just trying to accomplish today, or maybe even like the next hour. hour. or a minute or five minutes you know, like it's very like sobriety is very much a very small small steps at a time."
148.0,Provider,yeah.
13136.0,Patient,"You know, and so and that's what also makes it hard is because it's like. You can't promise people forever you can't promise people, tomorrow you really, really cannot but you can promise them today, you can promise them the next hour, you can promise them the next five minutes. And then, once you have maybe more time and you feel more confident, maybe then you can kind of be like you know. I am on this wonderful path, I have been sober for three months, I really do believe that I can make it to six, you know and that's when I think that you can start, but especially within the first 30 days it's like you really have to just. focus on today."
148.0,Provider,yeah just today um I do have another good movie on Amazon prime that might be good for you to actually watch with your moms and it's more of them. Okay that's a father's perspective of.
13136.0,Patient,"Oh, I know what I know what it is it's with Jim no not Jim i'm Steve carell right."
148.0,Provider,"yeah beautiful boy. They have to it's a true story, you want to make sure you won't be triggered if you see drugs or somebody using."
13136.0,Patient,"yeah yeah I mean I would love to watch it again, but yeah the i've watched it and my mom. I don't. know I don't know if i'm yeah it's funny we actually saw last night and my moms like Oh, did you see them I like that's a good one, and I was like I did that's a really good. a really good film and from the different perspective as well um. There was like another one too I watched it, I just wanted to share this one with you because Maybe you can look into it, if you're interested there was one that I had watched. about a month ago, and I actually watched it at my mom's House back in California, but it was on hulu and I can't remember the name of it, but it was with Mila kunis."
148.0,Provider,I just watched that recently feel that's a good one.
13136.0,Patient,"yeah yeah. And I think that that one for me it was really eye opening because that one you see from her perspective, you see that she. You know, is trying to like promise like you know that she you know, but every single time it's like people don't. People don't trust her and they don't trust her and they don't believe in her and so from that like perspective from her perspective, I really saw that like wow you know, like but you also see the fact like she really does really wants that shot like so badly, you know i'm just."
148.0,Provider,goggles of addiction is what it portrays. You know yeah perfectly another one um I think that's a newer one with Julia Roberts has been as back I don't remember if it's on prime or netflix but that's another good one similar to beautiful boy and. What was the one with Mila kunis called.
13136.0,Patient,I forget. yeah but neither.
148.0,Provider,"i'm Courtney, I have to get to my next. session before I let you go, I just wanted to ask you, I saw some. bruising and some scratches on your leg and me."
13136.0,Patient,"Oh yeah. That was from last week yeah That was the ocean, the rocks very rough out there, this whole kino raw so it's not like normal raw it really scape seal and then yeah the bruises just from all of this is really just from last week, when I was drinking at that party."
148.0,Provider,"yeah so um I want to give you one more thing I know it's a lot, so if you don't get to everything this week before next session that's Okay, but I want you to make a list of all the things that have happened when you're drinking."
13136.0,Patient,"Okay, like, I remember you had to sign that to me, I never got to it so i'll definitely do that okay good."
