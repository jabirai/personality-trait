To to holiday okay. i'll just report that over to your provider that will your providers aware on you should be able there's a possibility that. i'm going to get bridge out for you, for medication renewal and it will be. For the two and a half per day, and it will be a four day supply with one additional refill just to get you taken care of until your next appointment, which is on 12 eight. And then again that's for group, and then you have that appointment scheduled for individual therapy on 12 nine. So when I call in the prescription it'll be for four days but there'll be a refill attached to it, so you just have to go back to the pharmacy. And they may not allow it, depending on your insurance plan and the pharmacy they may not allow you to pick this up until tomorrow morning, are you going to be okay, in the meantime."
12730.0,Patient,"Of course, in the morning at nine o'clock. To test."

386.0,Provider,"it's a unique situation um, but I would send out a text message, once this orders completed and then what I would. recommend is just contacting the pharmacy after received a text message I recommend calling over the pharmacy about 30 to 60 minutes after you get that text message, because what they had to do is write it down on a script pad and then enter it into their system. Okay alrighty. But other than that absolutely not a problem is there anything else that I could assist with today."
