12751.0,Patient,Good i've been doing good I just i've been having.
741.0,Provider,A lot of lead.
12751.0,Patient,A lot of drug theory.
741.0,Provider,dreams.
12751.0,Patient,yeah.
741.0,Provider,yeah using dreams are they realistic.
12751.0,Patient,yeah.
741.0,Provider,yeah scary almost time.
12751.0,Patient,yeah.
741.0,Provider,Okay um. When was your last when was the last time you used what's your what's your clean date Do you remember.
12751.0,Patient,The 17th of. July.
741.0,Provider,"Okay, so that was will see of it September, October yeah that's about right that's 90 days you're at a 90 day mark. And what happened is see our body of the cells in our body remember. And so they are remembering and the cycle that our bodies go through when we detox and get off of this stuff and every 30 6096 months, nine months a year, you know, in the 12 step programs, they give you. coins or or for various links of clean time right. Well, they do that for a reason because it's during that period of time that your body. starts remembering and getting on. Getting antsy basically. And and wants you to go back to doing what you were always doing. And so. it's your way it's your body's way of getting that out of it. And they're not they're not very much fun, especially when you wake up and you feel like you've used, and then you feel high all day. Is that what you've experienced."
12751.0,Patient,yeah.
741.0,Provider,"yeah. that's awful. I used to wake up in a panic. Did you just wake up. Yes, no you didn't use. Your all right. So it does happen, and I don't want to minimize it it's not. It will happen. For a while around your 90 day mark and then it'll happen again, probably around six months, probably not as intensely at six months, as it is."
12751.0,Patient,Right now.
741.0,Provider,um and the further away from your clean day. That you get the further away the less intense they'll become what's scary is when. you're five or six years down the road and they have one and you're like what does that come from. there's usually something in your life triggering it.
12751.0,Patient,But.
741.0,Provider,"They do happen it's normal. there's nothing it's not. it's not anything to get concerned about. If you weren't having them I might be a little you know wondering what's going on. But. The fact that you're having them means that you're going through a normal process of recovery. Okay. Anything else going on bugging you, and if you have any questions about that that um."
12751.0,Patient,"dreams and stuff, though, though I. told her about it, she told me, basically, what you told me."
741.0,Provider,So we're not going into yes.
12751.0,Patient,"We telling you the truth, I had. I had a friend yesterday that he has a drinking problem, and he got. About four months ago, and he got six year to present yes."
741.0,Provider,"yeah and that you know and that could be another thing that kind of triggered your your dream, you know is that you know. Our behavior has consequences, and when we get involved with the legal system, those consequences can be severe. And when stuff like that happens you're supporting subconscious can kick in and freak out basically. Our bodies are very, very complicated. And they do really interesting things. So they don't they don't. Our bodies are. Sometimes they get really confused, based on what we've been doing, you know. And okay. hmm. Okay you're caught up on all of your surveys and your drug screen so that's good. Okay yeah you just finished all those."
12751.0,Patient,yeah.
741.0,Provider,Have you um. Have you been depressed or i'm feeling like you want to hurt yourself or someone else.
12751.0,Patient,Though.
741.0,Provider,No okay just second and make sure. Sometimes those can trigger dreams to. All the dreams can trigger you to get depressed.
12751.0,Patient,So i've always been a big dream.
741.0,Provider,Big dreamer. Depending on your ideas of spirituality there are people who have like. They tend to see visions in their dreams or. When they meditate. and Some people call them seers. and I believe that some people are more gifted that way.
12751.0,Patient,"yeah i've been an intense retriever I could dream, they say you don't you're not supposed to dream to your deep into a deep sleep, but I could start dreaming literally. can manage it all asleep."
741.0,Provider,"Right right. yeah that makes sense, I actually dream more when i'm in rem like my eyes are like fluttering around where i've just barely gotten to sleep, because once I go into that deep sleep i'm like come on."
12751.0,Patient,yeah me too.
741.0,Provider,"All right, so you're going to group."
12751.0,Patient,yeah.
741.0,Provider,how's it working. You like your group learning listening.
12751.0,Patient,i'm not a big talker I really talking other people.
741.0,Provider,uh huh.
12751.0,Patient,"And it was like it was I was getting like it was saying, people with it, but it just seems like every week, though it up."
741.0,Provider,"yeah. Right, so the more new people, the more uncomfortable you get."
12751.0,Patient,yeah.
741.0,Provider,"yeah I make sense. um. We don't tend to be social butterflies. for whatever reason. And I the way I figure it as a lot of addicts prefer on they have trust issues because they've been burnt. um. At least most of the people that i've associated with have. um. And I think that's one of the reasons why people object to going to outside support groups. Because they're the. The attendees are change regularly. But the funny part of it is, is that life is change. And we unfortunately have to figure out how to cope with change. So um. What happens to you when you when you experience change that. You don't want. To experience."
12751.0,Patient,All that you know you would you would they ask you to talk a little like.
741.0,Provider,say you stay quiet you listen.
12751.0,Patient,yeah.
741.0,Provider,Do you take in what's being said.
12751.0,Patient,yeah.
741.0,Provider,there's nothing wrong with.
12751.0,Patient,Listen like I just fade out.
741.0,Provider,"Right right if you're listening and and can actually learn from what they're talking about, then you haven't wasted your time. And you're not I mean that's. that's a good thing."
12751.0,Patient,So let's do the logistic you're full of shit.
741.0,Provider,"Well, sometimes. Some of them are. I mean, and at times we all are, especially when we're new and recovery right."
12751.0,Patient,yeah.
741.0,Provider,"I mean we walk around thinking that that. You know our thought is revelation light, you know. And that's not necessarily true. We have."
12751.0,Patient,"you listened when you listen to some people like they just were taking a couple pain pills here, you know. Like all this happens, this happen, like you, don't even know that. You know, because you're aware doubt that but uh."
741.0,Provider,huh.
12751.0,Patient,"You did a fear you to experience, did you think it was hard that."
741.0,Provider,"See, they can learn from your experience, thank you. actually find some gratitude. From your experience."
12751.0,Patient,See.
741.0,Provider,You would actually by by sharing your experience. You can actually bless somebody. You can help them. Find gratitude for where they're at.
12751.0,Patient,yeah.
741.0,Provider,"hi. So just a different way to look at it sometimes sometimes we need help, looking at it differently that's all. So do you go to any outside support groups."
12751.0,Patient,Though. Okay yeah I just can't deal with it.
741.0,Provider,"Okay you're probably not ready for that yet. You can go to them online now. The outside like a or na or celebrate recovery or smart recovery or any of those outside support groups. There online too, so that you don't actually have to get up and go, which is a good thing. But you may not be ready for that right now. And that's okay."
12751.0,Patient,yeah oh you're older group.
741.0,Provider,"I understand. I do understand that. But sometimes for health, we have to do stuff that we don't really want to do. Right."
12751.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
741.0,Provider,Like did you really want to get up this morning.
12751.0,Patient,"yeah I did, but I had you."
741.0,Provider,Right right. So do you have a certain time that you go to bed and a certain time that you get up every day.

12751.0,Patient,Basically I got the bad car wreck.
741.0,Provider,yeah.
12751.0,Patient,"Basically, like everybody else out there, we get there."
741.0,Provider,"yeah. yeah they give them to you until they say, oh no you're gonna get addicted too late, you already are. Right."
12751.0,Patient,Before you as prescribed.
741.0,Provider,"Right. And then, they said, you know they're going to make you addicted so they yank on. And then, then, what do you do. You get really sick or you go to the street to."
12751.0,Patient,Do.
741.0,Provider,"So I was not one of those. I was. Actually, one of those in. Doing heroin and cocaine, I was a literal junkie. So anything that I asked you to do and in our sessions i've already done it. I have 15 years sober. This time I had 13 years, the first time. And then I relaxed so. i've been out there, doing the doing the the recovery thing and i've been out there, doing the messed up thing so. i'm not going to ask you to do anything that I haven't had to put myself through doing okay."
12751.0,Patient,yep.
741.0,Provider,"So, what are you doing for pain, other than taking suboxone. Okay, are you still experiencing pain."
12751.0,Patient,yeah.
741.0,Provider,All right. So I assume that I would assume that one of the things that you would like to do in treatment is learn how to manage the pain more effectively.
12751.0,Patient,"Is that accurate I know i'm a dog. marriages, but again by every day with it."
741.0,Provider,Okay. As it as good as you think it's gonna get.
12751.0,Patient,yeah.
741.0,Provider,Okay okay. You don't have those periods of time when you really wish to get a break from it.
12751.0,Patient,Of course.
741.0,Provider,yeah. I will ever. Have you ever tried meditation to try to control that to get that break.
12751.0,Patient,Law just take it as well.
741.0,Provider,Okay. So you're you're you're still relying on the pills and granted it's not an addictive pill. But you're still relying on something outside of yourself to handle it right.
12751.0,Patient,yeah.
741.0,Provider,"That may be that may be, or you want to do, I can't make that decision for you, but there are other options. and So what do you expect, what do you what is it that you would like to accomplish man in order to get your suboxone you have to do therapy so Is there something that you'd like to accomplish in your therapy."
12751.0,Patient,What if they.
741.0,Provider,just want to stay clean okay.
12751.0,Patient,Yes.
741.0,Provider,"Yes, staying off the street is a good thing. Do you use. marijuana to. Are you clean. Okay. To see your stable you're living with your family. Your anxiety is gone down to a minimal level. same what the depression. Are you drinking. Okay, you just smoking. yeah all right. yeah I don't like the taste of it personally. So do you consider yourself a spiritual person."
12751.0,Patient,No.
741.0,Provider,"No okay. All right. um. I will say this, that the next time that we meet. We can start working toward a relapse prevention plan. If that's something that you're interested in doing."

741.0,Provider,"Okay, so next time I will. Bring. A worksheet which i'll email to you, and in fact I can email it to you now, if you would like for me to. and And you can look over it. and answer the questions and then we can go over it together next time how's that sound."
12751.0,Patient,yeah that's fine.
741.0,Provider,And then we can start putting together a i'm a plan. So that we can keep relapse from happening.
12751.0,Patient,Okay.
