10832.0,Patient,"I was trying to get on my laptop, but when I went on, it was like no audio they're like we can hear you and I was always so I couldn't hear anything back i'm like oh my God, I have to cancel it was like wait no I don't got my phone so we're good."
416.0,Provider,Nice it worked out. pull up your last. With me look at the notes really quick.
10832.0,Patient,How are you. Sorry.
416.0,Provider,What did you see.
10832.0,Patient,A bunny a crochet bunny.
416.0,Provider,"Oh hold on I can't see you right now i'm looking at your notes. Sorry, oh i'm okay ah, I remember what we talked about last time. No, I ready so tell me in how are you what's been going on since we talked last time."
10832.0,Patient,"I mean same same same I am. For to help with my anxiety I don't know if i'm supposed to do it, but I take to boost bars a day one at night, one in the morning, so what's been actually really helping is if I take them, both in the morning i'm that's kind of alleviated some. As far as like not being able to focus and stuff so I know my anxiety has a lot to do with it, but."
416.0,Provider,Have you can tell Anna. How can you have you checked in with chantel.
10832.0,Patient,"need to ask. I need to ask her about that on. Friday I just wasn't you know beings, it was I wasn't going over the dosage is the same, I was just taking them at the same time figured it was the same as my. suboxone cuz I take it all in one shot and she said it's fine but i'll double check for sure, with that because I want to be wrong Okay, but. yeah no holidays are coming stressing me out, I still have to order my daughter stuff and I haven't."
416.0,Provider,"Has there was there, did you have any luck with the therapists that I gave you."
10832.0,Patient,"I haven't looked yet I was gonna start looking after the holidays it's too much right now. I might so this this weekend i'm thinking about leaving messages so with me it's like a procrastinating thing. Like i'll do a little work i'll get discouraged and then you know, obviously I have other leads to go on, but now. I feel like overwhelmed so my dad's like you have to do one thing at a time and for me it's just like everything at once, like I don't know where to start. And then I always make excuses now i'm saying after the holiday, but I guess I should probably just do it and get it over with it's just. I don't know why i've always been this way I just can't manage to actually. Successfully do something on my own like I always need help, and I feel like it's cuz my dad is always been the one helping me. I feel like i'm not sufficient, on my own like i'm like dad what do I do next one is obvious, you make the phone calls."
416.0,Provider,"So you don't have a lot of confidence in yourself, is what i'm hearing."
10832.0,Patient,"Is that's what it is i've been told that my whole life it's because my mom I have. No confidence at all my dad's always tried to make it a little bit better, for me, but she pretty much stripped all that, I mean. even trying out for stuff, as you know, kids like sports and stuff I always quit you know I never follow through with anything I started, something that I liked and then I just stopped doing it just because I felt I wasn't good. And my mom let me do that she'd condoned it so instead of telling me, you can do it and pushing it, you know she just let me quit and. But so that's pretty much where I stand with that. I guess i'm just nervous of all the outcomes from everything i've never thought about Christmas i'm nervous. about the therapy thing with the whole situation how how it's going to go, so I just stall."
416.0,Provider,"Okay well i'm gonna. yeah I wish that worked right, because then you but they it just doesn't work that way."
10832.0,Patient,yeah.
416.0,Provider,It just doesn't make it go away.
10832.0,Patient,"To do that, so either, because this week, I was like I promised myself i'm going this weekend Saturday i'm going to make a phone call I don't have to talk to anybody right away if they don't answer, they will call during. The week give a message and i'll be like it's a lot thinking, I have to call these people and explain myself over and over over something that really hurts every single time having talked about it. So that's why I have what we're doing it, you know i'll put it in a little work and get discouraged like okay I don't want to do that anymore it's too hard to talk about like to explain my situation, and then you know."
416.0,Provider,"Okay hold on i'm gonna. want to show you this, let me see if I can find it. yeah this is. Come on. The images so hold on one second. Time zoom in okay alright So here we go. Let me share my screen with you real quick. This is an image that's really powerful for me right, like when we have big tasks to do if we don't break them into tall steps they feel very out of reach and it's easy to just give up. But when it's a bunch of little ones you weren't looking way up here right. before you know it you're up here, but all you have to do is look at this one right here. And then that one and then that one right."
10832.0,Patient,"that's been something I struggled with my whole life was. easily getting very, very overwhelmed not knowing how to. Like you know. Where do I start, you know it's like a kid trying to clean up their room I hear. My niece she's fires all the time, like kaylee clean up your room and she goes, and she starts crying I don't know where to start like. She doesn't know what toy to pick up first like where do I put the toy, though, and you know i'm like that reminds me so much of how I feel on a day to day basis."
416.0,Provider,"Okay i'm just reading my notes myself so. You mentioned, making a call. and doing you want to do it this weekend, so that nobody answers."
10832.0,Patient,"Well, not necessarily so, nobody answers it's it's so. I want, I have a full day i'm not at work, stressed out trying to make the time dad hey I got a call these people can you hold on. And I can I have time to actually place these phone calls, but also, I know that not everybody answers, especially on a Saturday so i'm able to leave a message. Like briefly and they call me back, maybe a separate time so I don't have to like just pour my heart out to all these people and, like you know, a couple hours it sucks it's really hard in it stresses me out for the rest of the day I don't know why it works like that, but it does I just. yeah I got issues it's just hard, even the therapy sessions i'm always crying afterwards, because they're hard. yeah they're they're really hard to you know. crack everything back open when you spend all week trying to just tell yourself it's Okay, and then having to talk about it so."
416.0,Provider,"Well, how about we just spend this time problem solving."
10832.0,Patient,Would that be helpful yeah.
416.0,Provider,yeah I understand not wanting to like. pull the scab off awareness when you're already feeling so vulnerable.
10832.0,Patient,yeah.
416.0,Provider,We don't have to do that.
10832.0,Patient,"No, I mean it's not it's definitely not you, I mean even the group's it's just it's all you know it's a lot of emotion and like you know, usually I hide it but. it's hard. Because it's the only time I really talk about anything is when I have my groups and stuff because I just don't. You know everybody's heard everything already from my family I just i'm burnt out on it. Now i'm expected to make the steps to change things and i'm just I have like the roadmap, I have everything I need to do it and i'm still stuck and i'm like why."
416.0,Provider,"It feels like you're stuck that you're not you. You have come so far already. you're here. it's really normal in any time you're moving forward in life to slide backwards, a little bit. yeah and then have to keep going and it feels like a kick in the gut when it happens."
10832.0,Patient,yeah big time.
416.0,Provider,"yeah, the key is to keep going, little by little, even if it's just one tiny, tiny thing, even if it's just making one phone call all you have to do it's that inertia, you know that gets you when you stop doing stuff and it's really hard to get going again."
10832.0,Patient,I guess I could take it like that to do it just a call a day if that if that helps eases my stress a little.
416.0,Provider,"spread it out, nobody says, you have to do it all in one day and often like putting it out for a while, puts more pressure on it right, because then it's like the lead up to it."
10832.0,Patient,"always like on the back your mind, like, I have to do this, I have to do this well just wait, you know wait for this day to come and i'll do it and they just the whole outcome of everything, even when I do all this stuff I just i'm I think what makes me stall is like I just. it's just going to is going to be so much work it's, not that I don't want to do it it's just the beating i'm going to take along the way you know, trying to see her it's just it's really hard."
416.0,Provider,To have you found to pick up.
10832.0,Patient,"And i'm not even going to see her Christmas, I can't call her because he won't let me. He didn't let me call her on her birthday, just because he wanted to be a Dick but. yeah it just sucks. At where I put myself so."
416.0,Provider,"How are you, you were saying that you know you don't really have any room or space to express yourself last time we talked we talked about making sure that you have some journaling or someplace. To express your emotions. And yeah not."
10832.0,Patient,"yeah yeah no I started writing. i'm going to get a book that I don't like the one I got I got a pretty big one, but. I have, but I find it so hard to sit and write. It like i'm doing it, but it's it's like therapy all over him, you know. Giving it all."
416.0,Provider,"And it's going to feel that way at first, and it will get easier, with time. yeah right because you won't have so much it's the build up of stuff and the sticky the starkness of it, I don't think that's a word, but I just made. it's that build up and how stuck it gets right it's sort of like the oh it's the overwhelm that you're feeling right it just became so big. And it was already."
10832.0,Patient,"yeah I did I think I did a couple of memoria was only i'm only doing it, if I were to do it more it's a couple times a week, I think that have like three right now and that. It was hard, I tried doing it the first day and. I was like I can't do this anymore, this is too hard, because it's one thing to feel it, but then to write it out and actually like read it again you're just like oh my God. Look. look up right now."
416.0,Provider,"mm hmm better out than in, though. yeah yeah it's alarming it's not something you don't know by yourself you're feeling it you're experiencing the physical symptoms and the emotional symptoms of it."
10832.0,Patient,You know.
416.0,Provider,I get it out.
10832.0,Patient,"yeah definitely I just. It helps though writing oh there's you know, writing and doing stuff with my hands, because I spent so many years with a needle you know injecting that. When i'm not moving my hands are doing something with my hands like I start getting anxiety so that's why I started like crocheting stupid about it."
416.0,Provider,it's really cure.
10832.0,Patient,It is almost done you guys.
416.0,Provider,hearing a year you got mad skills lady at.
10832.0,Patient,"The top of the head there we'll see. But it that paint. painting writing this I tried to find stuff to keep my hands busy the writings a little more emotional but. yeah I might just get a mite I was thinking about just getting a better book to write in because the one I have is more of like my Taro journal which isn't like. So, like it is. It just doesn't go as deep as it does with my thoughts, you know, so I have that in my Taro and then i'll have that, but I think if I just get a separate book i'll feel like the two or you know Taro Taro and then Charles for gentle. Perfect yeah and I can actually look that one or something."
416.0,Provider,Were you able to we talked about the anxiety and phobias workbook are you able to get that.
10832.0,Patient,"No thanks for reminding manage to do that that's what I was on Amazon, I was like I know, once he gets."
416.0,Provider,here for a reason.
10832.0,Patient,"And like I do that so much. Oh, my God, no, I really wanted that book yeah I hope they have it on there."
416.0,Provider,They do that's where I got mine yeah.
10832.0,Patient,"Okay, let me go on and they really need that I was like. That you had."
416.0,Provider,To go good one.
10832.0,Patient,Do you write in it.
416.0,Provider,"And you can definitely it's there are like. yeah there are see. there's there's quite a few exercises. But there are, I mean if it's just yours yeah I would write in it. yeah there's like. pages like this where, are you."
10832.0,Patient,Oh yeah.
416.0,Provider,quizzes and stuff. Like that so actually it's interesting and this one that I just happened to land on. Is panic attack worksheets about body symptoms and catastrophic thoughts during panic attacks. And then you know.
10832.0,Patient,When you're having a panic attack or do you to it like.
416.0,Provider,"It was with me. there's another thing that I was going to look out for you can find it it's. Just I write it down. 13 pete Walker that's what I was going to look it up, I wanted to share this with pete Walker the. Steps for ptsd flashbacks and pants hold on. I want to find that and i'll give you the link for it. yeah. there's a PDF."
10832.0,Patient,let's.
416.0,Provider,Get specific flashbacks.
10832.0,Patient,yeah. You do yeah.
416.0,Provider,"Do these lead to panic attacks, for you. Okay, so this is a really, really good one i'm going to share my screen with you and then i'm going to make sure that you have this. i'm going to make sure you have this PDF."
10832.0,Patient,You think you can email it.
416.0,Provider,"mm hmm. shirt I am. Alright, so the first first step is to acknowledge what's actually happening right, I am having a flashbacks yeah i'm having a flashback right because that takes us in pulls us into the moment. Instead of you know, drawing you back to what actually happened but it's just acknowledging here I am i'm in this moment i'm having a flashback so even saying it out loud. And then, reminding yourself again out loud if you need to I feel afraid, but I am not in danger, I am safe now I am here in the present. Right so own you're right and you need to have boundaries you don't have to allow anyone to mistreat you if you are having a flashback because you're in a dangerous situation you are free to go you get to leave you get to speak up if something is unfair, you do not have to be mistreated."
10832.0,Patient,"yeah it's the trauma associated with all the flashbacks I have that it just sends me off into like a full blown you know. yeah no um. it's really bad like I can't change what happened and that's what gives me, you know the most anxiety, like all the all the things. All the horrible things that this person put me through like. I yeah it kills me still still have nightmares I wake up yelling you know, and my sleep and i'm like what the hell was I just yelling at you know."
416.0,Provider,"This is where these skills come in right, because what it is, is your your body your brain is stuck in that loop and it's re experiencing that that thing that happened."
10832.0,Patient,Like over and over.
416.0,Provider,"Because it's trying to process it. But reminding yourself, I am right here, I am right now I am not in that space right. I am safe right here, right now, I am having a flashback that's what's happening. Right. And then speaking reassuringly to yourself right they talk if you talk about your inner child here it doesn't have to be your inner child. It can be your inner younger adult version of yourself right it's the girl who was trapped there the girl who stuck speaking to her the way she needed to be spoken to in that moment."
10832.0,Patient,you're.
416.0,Provider,Offering her comfort and love acknowledging that she felt lost and scared. right that she felt terrified.
10832.0,Patient,know.
416.0,Provider,"So and deconstructing the eternity thinking what that means really is that just acknowledging that the flashback is going to pass. Okay, that in the moment it feels like this is never going to end right. And it's easy to get pulled back there, but what this is is a flashback and it will pass it will end."
10832.0,Patient,"yeah I totally freeze when I have like just completely it's like watching a movie in your head over and over and half the time during the day when i'm trying to work. i'm trying to like at least mute the video, so I can try to concentrate but it's still it's still going and it's still going it's still applying. But every now and then it just It makes me like completely just stop and I realized. Like oh no, no, or I just start crying or I start, you know hyperventilating and that's happened several times like a it's just it's almost like you're there it's like it's it's weird. it's like you're for a second everything I see is like it's different like my actual site makes it look like i'm at that place where I was it's weird I can't even explain it it's really odd."
416.0,Provider,"So um I mean I don't think you have to explain it, because what you're describing is perfect flashbacks it's pts it's complex ptsd it's very. So your body is just it's as if your brain and your body are responding as if you are so in that exact same situation."
10832.0,Patient,yeah what it feels like.
416.0,Provider,"So, reminding yourself that you're in an adult body. That you have allies that you've skills, you have resources that you never had. When you were younger and, in this situation."
10832.0,Patient,You know.
416.0,Provider,"And then starting to ease back into your body, because you know that panic that fear that flashback it launches us right into our head, so we get away from our body, and you know you're. preaching the choir here, but like your breathing gets. Really rapid in shallow and your your blood pressure, goes up like your you know your body releases, a lot of adrenaline and. So coming trying to come back into your body and gently actually asking your body to relax right feeling each of your major muscle groups, you can tighten them and relax them. breathing slowly and deeply try really hard not to hold your breath. slowing down finding a safe place to unwind ensued. wrap yourself in a blanket get yourself a weighted blanket sometimes that helps if that's comforting to you. afraid of the animal, you know, whatever it is right."
10832.0,Patient,"yeah. I just like a year now almost a year like. How much longer is that i'm like i've told my dad always have i'm just i'm so tired like oh. I just i'm so tired of it going and like I get it smoke stop playing and. He was he's like well why are you so angry day or something like that i'm like that. It wouldn't be too, if this thing was just not fucking stopping all day long just non stop."
416.0,Provider,that's yeah you're right.
10832.0,Patient,"Like psychological torture, sometimes i'm like oh my God."
416.0,Provider,So heather I want you to read the number eight through 13. I want you to read them i'm not gonna read them to you.
10832.0,Patient,resist that inner critics dress to sizing and catastrophizing dinner.
416.0,Provider,"Yes, you did."
10832.0,Patient,You stop stopping to halt to unless exaggeration of danger and constant planning to control the uncontrollable refuse to shame hate urbana yourself channel that anger of self attack into saying no to unfair self criticism. Use thought substitution to replace negative thinking with them with a nice list of your qualities and accomplishments okay. So. Basically it's saying to avoid. shaming hating or. letting yourself and. All the crap.
416.0,Provider,Right it's it's i'm stopping the thoughts that spin from the flashback right.
10832.0,Patient,Oh everything adds up.
416.0,Provider,"saying you know you might be saying to yourself, something like. I made all the choices that landed me here it's my fault this bad thing happened I don't deserve to feel better I deserve to keep feeling off or whatever it is right, like that to kind of come into your head. that's what. that's what they're saying they're saying. Stop on those thoughts. refuse to shame hate or abandon yourself. Speak to yourself into what you needed at the time."
10832.0,Patient,No.
416.0,Provider,channel the anger of that you're feeling to attacking yourself into saying no to unfair self criticism. Use thought substitution to replace the negative thinking with positive things about yourself your qualities your accomplishments.
10832.0,Patient,"that's so funny because I do try doing that a different I mean it's not worded exactly like that stuff but. I do try that's what like it's okay you're never gonna have to see any of these people ever again and then half of my rain will be like but oh my God, you understand, like what just like what what you did, and like what was done and then either. But it's all right that's not you know you're not gonna have to live the rest you're not Why would you live, the rest of your life. With that over here like you know less not your entire was a moment, so I do do that I go back and forth all the time and that's that's why i'm so tired all the time, so i'm just like shut up."
416.0,Provider,yeah exhausting.
10832.0,Patient,"It is yeah, but I do I do try to do that and. Think it's something i'm just gonna have to keep trying to do a till it stops, I guess, I don't."
416.0,Provider,"yeah you're you're already doing some of it, you just this is. This is like a recipe to help with flashbacks so you've got certain ingredients in the recipe already there and we just want to add some more right make sure that all the ingredients are there let's keep going let's do number nine."
10832.0,Patient,let's say allow yourself to grieve flashbacks and opportunities to old unexpressed feelings of fear hurt and abandonment and to validate and then to the child. Past experience of helplessness and hopelessness healthy grieving can turn our tears into self compassionate anger into self protection.
416.0,Provider,This is what we've been talking about right. yeah getting those emotions.
10832.0,Patient,feel the feelings.
416.0,Provider,feel the feelings.
10832.0,Patient,Of color hate that.
416.0,Provider,"I do, too, I do too i'm a therapist but I mean I."
10832.0,Patient,feel it.
416.0,Provider,"I know of course you don't because it's really, really unpleasant. But you have to get it out."
10832.0,Patient,You know.
416.0,Provider,"I mean, and more importantly, you deserve the space and the opportunity to get it out and let it go for good."
10832.0,Patient,You know.
416.0,Provider,So let's go on to number 10.
10832.0,Patient,"cultivate self or i'm sorry cultivate safe relationship and seek support take time alone when you need it, but don't let shame isolate you feeling shame doesn't mean you are shameful educate your. intimates about flashbacks and ask them to help you talk and feel your way through them. that's one thing I don't know. I think my shame is isolated me for a very long time. But then. When I think of going out i'm not like you know, a friend, you know actually a one of the two friends, I still have that we're good people. The last minute go do something and I just don't feel like it's not because that's I don't feel shame like oh my God, you know. This and that I I just feel like I want to be alone like I just I don't have interest in doing things with anybody or like I have no other people's feelings, because my inner so overpowering. yeah that's why i'll never be in a relationship again probably I don't have the capacity to deal with somebody else's feelings like a I can't but part of it so probably a shame there's a lot of shame associated with. All this that's most of my anxiety."
416.0,Provider,"it's very connected to shame for you. So I love this sentence right here, take time alone when you need it don't let shame isolate you feeling shame doesn't mean you are shameful."
10832.0,Patient,So.
416.0,Provider,"We are not our feelings. Right. I might feel. Sad, one day, but that doesn't mean I am. A sad person it just means that's what i'm feeling, probably in response to whatever. Right, and I might feel. angry. But i'm not an angry person. The same thing I can feel shame about something that happened. But I am not shameful. Does that make sense."
10832.0,Patient,"yeah I mean I guess the thing is with me I don't feel like i'm you know I, I know I made some bad choices, but as a whole person I don't feel like i'm a shameful person, but the shame that I do feel is so crippling like it's. You know that's. that's the big thing that matters like yeah I probably am not a shameful person, but those moments, where I feel that shame, I definitely feel it like it's."
416.0,Provider,"yeah. You know yeah and there and that's good that's good that you're seeing those things as separate I think that's a great step and the shame that you're feeling is we're going to honor it right we're just not going to let it isolate you and it when you're ready. I mean, one of the steps that we will take is going to be around forgiveness and moving past the shame. I don't think you're quite there yet, because you're still kind of more in crisis and that, but we will get there, we will get to the point where we address that I mean you've actually seen. I don't know if you've noticed, there are some of your group members. Who are a little more like a little further along in their recovery and kind of out of the crisis phase. Who are. Who are doing this work right now."
10832.0,Patient,"so, which ones which sometimes because sometimes everybody has their moment, so I guess, I have never thought of it or looked at them like that yeah."
416.0,Provider,"yeah I mean they're doing the same stuff and that's when you start to find forgiveness and let go of shame and it's I think it's probably one of the harder steps to take, but that's relapse prevention right there. Because it's it's these it's the trauma the shame the feelings that we have about ourselves that keep pulling us back into the past and keeping us literal. So just for now it's really is just the cultivate safe relationships and seek support right. not letting shame isolate you it's there you feel it. Will just honor it. it's just something you feel right now but let's not let's make sure it doesn't isolate you and the first thought that came to my mind when you were talking about your social support was your sister in law. So it doesn't have to be friends right, it can be like I know your brother and your sister in law are important to you, your dad is important to you."
10832.0,Patient,Those are pretty much the only people I hang around just because.
416.0,Provider,And that's fine.
10832.0,Patient,"I can't even go to the store without having a panic attack, I tried to buy some clothes, the other day that's like that I had I literally grabbed two things and I had to leave just because one that was worried about running into some because i'm in. i'm on the opposite side of town of where I live, to but still in rancho I lived on a different side of rancho and I could still easily run into people. And I felt everybody was staring at me in the store and everybody knew everything, so I just like grabbed my shit and I left, and so I got to work through that for sure that's been an issue my whole life but. it's pretty bad right now so staying with them is like I don't really do anything without them. Now."
416.0,Provider,"So it's also speaking up to them and. and educating them on the flashbacks that you have so that they can be supportive saying this is what I need when this happens, or i'm just having a flashback I need to be alone for a few minutes right being able to ask for what you need."
10832.0,Patient,"With it, when it's them, it makes it easier if I was out in public, with a friend, it would just be you know more, shame and humiliation."
416.0,Provider,"Right so we're not ready for that. nobody's gonna push you through that right now we just want you to be stable. yeah okay so that's Okay, nobody i'm definitely not pushing you to like get out and go to places that worry you and stress you out night we're not there yet. yeah Okay, so no worries about that so let's go on to number 11."
10832.0,Patient,learn to identify the types of triggers that lead to flashbacks avoid unsafe people places activities and triggering mental processes practice preventative maintenance with these steps when triggering situations. When triggering situations are unavoidable. I already do that. Right definitely cut everybody out.
416.0,Provider,"Okay, so you do avoid people places and things that are triggering."
10832.0,Patient,yeah I don't you have.
416.0,Provider,The second part to this is really adopting these 13 steps. And you know practicing them as much as possible when things do come up right when triggering situations are unavoidable when you go back to a flashback it's it's also practicing this so there's it's kind of a two part.
10832.0,Patient,yeah yeah that would make sense.
416.0,Provider,What about number 12.
10832.0,Patient,"figure out what you are flashing back to flashbacks are opportunities to discover validate and heal our wounds from the past and abandonment, they also point to are still unmet develop developmental needs and can provide motivation to get them met."
416.0,Provider,"it's interesting because you brought up one earlier. Your sort of unmet developmental need around. or around confidence right and feeling like you are a confident and capable person. And in doing new things. and tell you things right so. I know that that's true, but you, that is an unmet developmental need for you, and it does trigger a lot of stuff for you right, it certainly contributes to your anxiety because you aren't hearing around the confidence that you can handle this stuff."
10832.0,Patient,yeah big time.
416.0,Provider,So figuring out what your flashing back to right.
10832.0,Patient,yeah.
416.0,Provider,"it's discovering validating and healing our wounds from past abuse. And it comes back to some of the earlier steps to around talking to that person, the person who experienced the abuse in a way that she needs to hear right in a loving way in a kind way. Right we're not going to judge her we're going to speak to her as the vulnerable hurt person she is."
10832.0,Patient,You know. Okay.
416.0,Provider,"And then, what about number 13."
10832.0,Patient,Be patient with a slow recovery process it takes time and the President to become what does that say an.
416.0,Provider,adrenaline right. yeah you to like have your adrenaline uh huh.
10832.0,Patient,"yeah and considerable time in the future to gradually decrease the intensity duration and frequency of flashbacks real recovery is a gradual process often two steps forward one step back, no not attained salvation fantasy don't beat yourself up for having a flashback."
416.0,Provider,So i'm going to send this to you heather what are some ideas of how you might use this in your life.
10832.0,Patient,"Oh, I mean i'm sure there's a lot, and that I could use."
416.0,Provider,"What do you want to do with this information, though, like do you want to print it out and put it around in different places to remind you how do you want to use it."
10832.0,Patient,Probably just try to price it. don't know.
416.0,Provider,But if you printed it out and put it like next to your desk places where you get like attacks a lot.
10832.0,Patient,yeah at home and at my desk probably.
416.0,Provider,yeah I would think keep keep copies around and definitely yeah like absorb it memorize it go with it.
10832.0,Patient,You know that might help. Hopefully.
416.0,Provider,yeah I was thinking about like How would we articulate a goal for you around the panic attacks and the flashbacks right because they're connected for you.
10832.0,Patient,"know, I think it would help, though. Because I mean there is, I mean I do some of the stuff on there, but seeing it written on paper, makes me feel like i'm not so far out there, you know I am trying to deal with it as much as I can that's obviously other people have felt this way you. Know written."
416.0,Provider,And a lot of people are going through this I use this with a lot of my patients.
10832.0,Patient,"Oh, you do."
416.0,Provider,"In and it works, I know people swear by this."
10832.0,Patient,yeah no seems like it.
416.0,Provider,it's really good stuff and when you're feeling more stable. We may want to consider em Dr for you also.
10832.0,Patient,whenever you think it's time you just let me know.
416.0,Provider,"Well, I think. I yeah i'm going to get some common a cop consult with my supervisor on it, because she does em Dr and asked her what she thinks. And then let you know i'm not am Dr certified, although I plan to get certified quite soon. But. But she is so I just want her expertise senate she's been doing it for years, because the last thing we want to do is make anything worse right, we want to make sure that you are in the right space and have the right prep and everything to be there."
10832.0,Patient,How did they do it over online I don't understand it's not something you need to be in person with or no.
416.0,Provider,"It turns out, you don't yeah the the i'm movement activation works online just as well. A lot of times it's even better, because the people, people feel safer in their own home usually. more open and relaxed. So um okay. So I emailed you the 13 steps the subject line just says print me and practice me."
10832.0,Patient,I give you that.
416.0,Provider,"Okay, and. Okay, and journaling getting this up right. And this is about breaking things into small steps heather right, you are in you've been in quite a crisis."

Really, so we want to try and deactivate you a little bit, and these are really great practices to do that the breathing the journaling relaxation techniques hot baths."

Is what we want to, we want to get to because when once your call, we can process through a lot more of this and we just have to kind of remind your body remind your brain that you're not that you're safe that you're not in crisis. And so let's let's first build those skills. And it's okay it's going to take time it's okay that it's going to take time in a sex for you."

416.0,Provider,"sucks for you, but it's good time."
