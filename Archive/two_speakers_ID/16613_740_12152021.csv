16613.0,Patient,Hello.
740.0,Provider,How are you.
16613.0,Patient,i'm doing well.
740.0,Provider,how's everything going.
16613.0,Patient,"um yeah it's going good I mean yeah we haven't spoken, since in two weeks right."
740.0,Provider,yeah. how's it been.
16613.0,Patient,"it's been good. yeah i've been taking. This acting class, so I have to memorize lines. yeah and i'm learning about breathing which a lot of the exercises are also there like things to help with your voice, but I think it's also. kind of work that I mean I guess the instructor is also is familiar with like Chakra work and he was saying that a lot of this stuff and it's supposed to meant it's meant to come from your gut and not from like your chest area. you're reading. Quick that so it's it's been good it's been yeah it's been a lot of i've been very open to like learning new things, I guess, but i'm still sort of behind with work like i'm just. I think i'm, just like in the thinking about things mode and not in the writing."
740.0,Provider,Things yeah yeah.
16613.0,Patient,i'm probably will start because I might have like a bunch of deadlines in the first week of January.
740.0,Provider,So how has the writer's block been.
16613.0,Patient,"I mean it's it's fine I it's not yeah I guess it's me being resistant to like looking at the page, but I almost feel like i'm almost ready it's more just like a half to you know it's kind of like when you know."
740.0,Provider,"uh huh. No, you."
16613.0,Patient,"When you want to change it's like that's the only time you can change and I kind of. feel that same way when I you know go back into my scripts and stuff. But I will say that, like since taking since starting this strattera I feel less anxious, which I think we had spoken about. In the Group and also with. Dominique but with you as well, and I yeah which has been really great like I didn't realize how anxious or how much of that I was working in like such a place of like being fearful and scared. So it's just even like wrapping my head around like this kind of new sense of clarity, I suppose. yeah which is really nice. So that's I think that's i'm like wait this feels different so that's kind of like the odd thing about having less anxiety like. way too revealing at. yeah it doesn't I always just like elite is the bulk and I draw soon Nice. I guess I didn't realize I had I was operating. I was operating like that, until I started taking your Tara and i'm not sure if it's like a placebo effect or not, but i'm really happy like i'm really happy that I feel this way. But I do still get sleepy like what I was driving I did like have to go and stop at a like get off the freeway and stop and like take a five minute nap because I just couldn't like keep my eyes open."
740.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16613.0,Patient,"And I don't know if it was also because I was tired, because I would just done a surf lesson. um but yeah I was just I it's happened a few times and I am just wondering if, like the part of Tara where it's supposed to address this like sleepiness like that part of my ADHD if that's gonna when that will kick in I guess."
740.0,Provider,When do you have group again.
16613.0,Patient,"it's just once a month, so I think I can I was just there last week, so not until January."
740.0,Provider,And the providers will. Just ask. that's the best way for us to know it just.
16613.0,Patient,asked about what.
740.0,Provider,And when in regards to when the. hair is going to kick in. Or will it will it actually was asleep.
16613.0,Patient,"Well, no, well, I when I talked to dominate group last week, like privately she had said, like we should just give it a month, and so this. 15th it'll be a month now. And then."
740.0,Provider,"Tomorrow, it will be a month."
16613.0,Patient,yeah tomorrow will be a month.
740.0,Provider,"Okay, so basically after tomorrow, if the sentence continue to pursue seeming to let us know."
16613.0,Patient,The sleepiness.
740.0,Provider,"Yes, that because that's important and the last thing we need is you fall asleep on the road."
16613.0,Patient,yeah yeah. yeah. But yeah i've also been thinking about the assignment about what would marry look like what would a confident. And I almost wish I almost wonder like i've been resistant to writing.
740.0,Provider,about that.
16613.0,Patient,"But I almost feel like I wonder if i'm. I wonder if i'm also just I feel like because that question was posed, I also think about it more often now when i'm moving about my dad having. interactions with people. So."
740.0,Provider,This is Lisa speaking in your brain will take there.
16613.0,Patient,yeah. um.
740.0,Provider,How do you dress your confidence level now.
16613.0,Patient,"know I mean I don't know, I think. Well it's been pointed out to me. That, for example with work, I always put my work first before myself. and Like with these applications and these grand things it's actually that I have to address, who I am as an artist and not my work because they're really funding me and not my work in this way. Right um so that's is like. yeah I mean, I guess, I still also i'm so. figuring out like Oh, you know, like i'm it always takes me, you know some time to be like oh i'm worthy to write this and i'm more the for this grads and all of. These things. To apply for it and stuff."
740.0,Provider,"So a lot of times are we get so consumed in our work. That we basically. Allow what we do to shape, who we are, when it's supposed to be the opposite it's because of who we are, this shapes what I do. yeah right and that's how it's supposed to go, you know, the thing about it is, is that if, when you allow your word to shape who you are. Then means that there is something doesn't go your way or if something does not perform the way you want it to be before then you, you will personalize it."
16613.0,Patient,If you ever see.
740.0,Provider,"yeah and so it's supposed to be the other way where you're going and. You say what can you do. What can I do i'm gonna tell you. You know, you know I like to do things I look at me weird strange and I answer it. Because I guess they expect like this real deep answer you know real philosophical and stuff like that, where it's not a deep enough that they profile, the thing about it is, is that you just have to change the way you think and change the way you see. If it is really truly is the belief. You believe that because you do good at what you do that, it is your job to shade, so you are when you supposedly there. Is because of who I am. That causes me to do a good job. So it's a belief. isn't belief it's a core belief, because you have developed this core belief you're saying that producing is your identity when that's not the case. The core belief is because of the fact that I am worthy. And that that I am. That I am significant enough to be able to render such things to the public that that's reason why people want me. And that's the reason why people have given me grants and that's the reason why is not because of the fact that of the work that i'm putting out but it's because of who I am they causes me to put out the work right. So basically you giving credit to your job, instead of you give a courtesy to say yeah. This is a belief, I know it's not they'd, be it is not their profile, but I guarantee you it's tough to change what you believe."
16613.0,Patient,"yeah I mean, I know that I am I know that i'm a good person like worthy of things and. Obviously, like I know it's a little bit clear to me how when i'm enjoying myself and when i'm having fun and when I. Am like a little bit more playful. With the way that I think, or with the way that i'm interacting with people, it also like it makes it when i'm playful and it I don't know if there is a better connection. between me and, like, for example, me and my siblings like when i'm more open with them. Then a respond more yes to me, and we, I feel closer to them. But yeah I do tend to when i'm really busy I do tend to shut out people I guess."
740.0,Provider,When it really yeah and i'll actually the people can actually be a good inspiration for the for the roadblock.
16613.0,Patient,yeah.
740.0,Provider,Your your your interactions with people can actually help. With the writer's block. yeah because in your exposure the end in your bio me help to spark and it helps it helps you be creative.
16613.0,Patient,"I feel like i'm constantly i'm better at reacting to something, then. You know, then it being something like I somehow feel like I respond true or when i'm. Responding to somebody it's responding to a question like I don't have an answer i'm just asking a question. Which is something that I also forget constantly too so that's why I feel like my memory is just also like I I need to work on my memory. Like, for example, the thing that I I have like it's i'm, this is what i'm memorizing. This is the thing and then I figured and then I looked it up online are some actors memorize their lines and then this is like how they do it, which is really cool. Which is basically like just taking the first word of the line the first words of sorry the first letters of the words and then doing it that way. Which is nice because it's kind of confidence building because i'm always like afraid that i'm i'm always afraid that i'm like dumber you know. Like I don't have. i'm not as. Like. i'm not as smart, as I was when I was younger or something like that, like I don't make things as quickly as when I was a kid."
740.0,Provider,yeah. So. um.
16613.0,Patient,He.
740.0,Provider,The confidence that you have you yourself. yeah it makes it more difficult when you're less confident.
16613.0,Patient,"yeah I mean it's. True, I mean, even when I was. Like when I was surfing, it was like I got in my head and then I couldn't do the thing that's supposed to be wrote. yeah. it's I think it's my it's my kryptonite."
740.0,Provider,kryptonite.
16613.0,Patient,"like this. Like it, you know they say that or there's like this Chinese proverb that says, like the problems that you have when you're three is basically the problem you're going to have for the rest of your life."
740.0,Provider,Your day.
16613.0,Patient,It was it's a Chinese proverb it's like something.
740.0,Provider,"Okay Okay, no I don't want to do. With the coach i'm sorry."
16613.0,Patient,"No, no, no, I mean I but it's like some proverb like that, but I almost feel like I can remember. Like I have. One key memory. And it's of me being like three or two and like sticking. toilet paper up my nose, all the way up my nose here and then and being like that was a good idea, and then realizing that I couldn't take it out and being really afraid and then I just hit it like I didn't tell anybody. And I was and then my and then I guess it started rotting now, this is the part I don't remember I just remember that part being like Oh, this is a good idea, and then doing it. But then, and then this is, of course, like a story that's been told to me that, like then my brother smells like obviously it was like rotting for a few days and then. Like if you that smells bad and then I had to go to the hospital and they have to take it out. But always be like that is probably the start of I mean that's not the start, but I will always think of that as like oh that's like when I felt like I did something really bad. And that I, I was gonna be like I wasn't I wasn't in trouble."
740.0,Provider,hmm. Were you what was the two sides of your lung.
16613.0,Patient,tissue tissue I like rolled up a tiny thing of tissue.
740.0,Provider,And I had to. live up there.
16613.0,Patient,"yeah it was like I saw it on it was like I always remember because I still remember like the dust. I remember how it was so sunny and dusty that I like pick the pick this thing up and then rolled it and then like yeah just sniffed it all the way up my nose and then, knowing that I couldn't get it out, and then I was just like let's wait and see."
740.0,Provider,But being a better way see.
16613.0,Patient,yeah.
740.0,Provider,"Well yeah I mean yeah I think I mean yeah it's understandable i'm glad that you are, that you are able to identify the same up when you are afraid. And it's basically like you said it was the fear of getting in trouble. Because you know you did something that you should. yeah However, this is not the case. This is empathy the thing about it is, is that you can carry over. That same belief into this case, even though it's completely different."
16613.0,Patient,yeah. yeah it's not related.
740.0,Provider,But the emotions are.
16613.0,Patient,yeah. yeah.
740.0,Provider,Braden with. fear of being afraid and being fearful. takes you back to that moment. So being emotions of the thing. Is if the situation is different stages of how emotions can be duplicated over different situation. However. The belief. is therefore it starts. yeah but the thing about it is you have to. Try one belief in order to. pick up another one. Another something that you want to work on in regards to competition thing.
16613.0,Patient,yeah I mean I guess it always worked out so.
740.0,Provider,"Anyway, to. Even in the midst of working out, you will lose yourself in the process if you don't work on it doesn't make sense. yeah yeah hey listen if God with workout workout it is at the same time you're going to lose who you are but I work at. Your career workout. uses what working. Does that make sense. it's my job to interview you in a selfie with me about me me tell me about Mary what is what is married. And then you, you know just say you're talking about your job. yeah and producing and writing. That, I would say, actually, this is a movie about you Lucy you get so lost in doing what you do that, you haven't taken the time to get to know you for you."
16613.0,Patient,yeah. I mean I. Do I know I feel like I know I know lots of things about myself. For sure.
740.0,Provider,But even though you know lots of things about yourself. What are the things about yourself that you're confident me.
16613.0,Patient,I don't know. I mean I. don't know I don't know that's such a broad question.
740.0,Provider,"dive that a brand. is affected question because the thing about it because it teaches you the difference it teaches you the difference to let you know that even regardless of whatever you know about just that that's one thing and it's really good to know things about yourself, however. My question is. That would you know it's not about what you know it's about what your company."
16613.0,Patient,"Right, where my confidence."
740.0,Provider,"Which is why you ride this graph. One day in March or April employees, want to do it okay i'm engaging. Imagine something for you to think about. So, other things that you do know about yourself."
16613.0,Patient,yeah.
740.0,Provider,What are you confident in of the things that you do now.
16613.0,Patient,"I mean, I know. I mean it is, is it can it be very basic because I feel like I know that i'm kind like I know that I have to treat like I know that I like to treat people and things like very gently and carefully."
740.0,Provider,Do you treat yourself time and very gently and carefully.
16613.0,Patient,i'm a little harder on myself.
740.0,Provider,"Okay, so you can't be a walking contradiction."
16613.0,Patient,"I mean that I have. I mean that I, you know I."
740.0,Provider,Know give you.
16613.0,Patient,"nobody's true I suppose it's true, but I do like. I don't know I think i'm funny sometimes I. I know I say, I know, sometimes I blurt things out when i'm not supposed to. Be and that's got me in trouble a few times. I don't know I feel like i'm always trying."
740.0,Provider,"So I have a question. And I heard you say that i'm always trying, but I want to know when do you feel like you're succeeding. you're right very nice you own questions tonight Okay, you all know."
16613.0,Patient,When do I know that i'm succeeding.
740.0,Provider,"Or what, what do you feel like you're feeding us like you said I feel like i'm always trying that's cool i'm glad that you always made it up, but I want to know. When do you feel like you're."
16613.0,Patient,"I don't know when I do something like when I got when I am in boulder and i've accomplished a problem you know when i'm working out or something and it's like Oh, I did it."
740.0,Provider,"Is that is that a success for you, or do you just feel like Okay, I did it."
16613.0,Patient,yeah sometimes I just feel like I did it.
740.0,Provider,"Well, I guess, a little rephrase my question, have you. Ever felt like. you've succeeded. In anything."
16613.0,Patient,i'm sure I have.
740.0,Provider,Definitely you just got to think about it.
16613.0,Patient,"I mean, I think, like on interpersonal interpersonal levels with my family, I definitely feel like i've. Like shown love, or you know have love been loving and that always felt really good that kind of. nope not that kind of success, what kind of success, are we talking."
740.0,Provider,"Mind you, this is talking about you and you alone now what you give to other people. But your own success. Once you feel like you would work because, like you say you said, I know that i'm always trying. You didn't you didn't say what you're trying to get you just know that you know that you constantly make efforts and things."
16613.0,Patient,"I mean yeah I wish. You judging myself like even when i'm driving and i'm I have a stick shift car i'm always like Oh, I like didn't shift good enough or something like that."
740.0,Provider,"Okay, so they made your best judgment."
16613.0,Patient,On.
740.0,Provider,Your.
16613.0,Patient,Really.
740.0,Provider,you're really going to give you. know what do you think about that so you're telling me out of all the things that you could ask assessing the one main thing that you could actually pick the date is judging yourself.
16613.0,Patient,"I mean it's The one thing I feel like I do anything I mean isn't that what isn't that what it means to like was not what self awareness is i'm not sure. I don't know. I success such a weird word I mean success is so successful so hard when I don't feel where when I. Have these goals that i'm trying to get a taste like working on and. The thing is, is, I know that it's not like I know not to wait to not to wait. And like I guess it's also maybe this is a push and pull but like i'm not trying to wait until everything is perfect to do anything. Although it sounds like that actually. yeah I don't know. I think i'm hard on myself for sure. I think yeah but success wise I don't know what i'm successful and i'm successful in when I like. it's all so superficial it's like Sometimes I feel good when I put on like the right clothes I don't know."
740.0,Provider,"So. let's let's let's get the actual definition, shall we so that we can."
16613.0,Patient,So that we can have what.
740.0,Provider,Success yeah. The accomplishment of an aim or purpose.
16613.0,Patient,"Right. yeah I mean I have had success i've definitely accomplished some things and. I have accomplish goals okay. But you said, what do I feel most successful in that i'm doing right now. yeah."
740.0,Provider,I can do that I don't even active I think that's a quick.
16613.0,Patient,"Question Oh well, I don't know I mean I was just gonna say i'm. not sure. I feel like. I don't know I think successes. it's. Like I don't think I want to measure myself that way."
740.0,Provider,"I know you measure yourself the judges, though."
16613.0,Patient,"I know, but It just seems like if i'm going to do that, then it's going to be really exhausting in the same way that you said, like if i'm always measuring myself based on work well if I don't get what I want, then i'm not going to be i'm going to be completely. You know devastated when I don't get it so that's why i'm that's why i've been you know, working on myself in this way, where I feel like I am you know consuming like feeding my mind working out. You know, doing the things that I want to do like surf lessons, or like exercising and like bordering I mean in any you know, like these. These social things like going out seeing friends. Behind deeds."
740.0,Provider,Like I feel like are. Great.
16613.0,Patient,Those are things that i'm I like know myself more because I do that okay.
740.0,Provider,"Well, the purpose of my question is a question I guess a little bit, but the rest of the main answer is, you make your own. Right, because the thing about it is you're trying to live up to somebody else. Just make your own. It takes too much work into much effort trying to live up to somebody else. When. What you're doing now. And what you're accomplishing now may 5 all by itself, you just don't see it that way. This is how you measure it you measure it according to how you see other people do. The benefits your confidence, the most."
16613.0,Patient,You got to stop it.
740.0,Provider,"You got it and that's the thing I tell my pay, I thought I thought another cleanse that I had after the only person that you should compare yourself to what you did you were yesterday."
16613.0,Patient,yeah.
740.0,Provider,"Because of it because, regardless of fake everybody has to start somewhere. And the fact that you're making effort and it just trying imagery attempting, and what you're doing what you have to do. Why is it not good enough. What do you have the judge day what does that have to be such a detriment to you."
16613.0,Patient,yeah.
740.0,Provider,"that's all. it's just a belief and that's something I would encourage you to do. To change your belief. not looking at your career if something that makes you. But, looking at yourself. is something that makes you career. it's not about it's not about the business. Because if you're no good in the business no good. You are the reflection and the business. it's, not the other way around. It just really comfortable with the. hive into our work. But the fact that you're doing these things you're taking. Would you say taking lessons out on the water and stealing a lot of these."
16613.0,Patient,are full time to.
740.0,Provider,Maybe go.
16613.0,Patient,"yeah but I. yeah but I, I mean i'm not going to do it again until January, because while i'm going it's i'm doing it here in La but i'm going back for the holidays, to the bay area and all that stuff and. yeah I have to practice, I have to practice things. yeah there's definitely like you know there's that part I remember when I was seeing some adult was seeing a therapist for ADHD. And he was saying how like there's a part of your brain there's like this voice in your mind that like just wants you to procrastinate and that wants you to do like actually enjoys it when you're not doing what you're supposed to do. mm hmm because then you're giving that part of your brain this attention that they want and so there's like. And I always think about that sometimes when i'm like. You know, sometimes it's really automatic when I just like you know I there's part of me that just is like I am so lazy I don't want to get out of bed, but then there's another part of me that doesn't think about it, and just get it gets out of bed. Like I don't make that decision. To get out of bed I just. Get out. And i'm always wondering. Like i'm not always wondering, but I do wonder, sometimes like. Which is the. Which is the like I think it's all like Avi I think that it's all of me, all of these different parts of. Like the one that's you know the one that's criticizing myself and the one that's like not and the one that's automatic and all of that stuff but I, I just wish that there was more of a. harmony."
740.0,Provider,and
16613.0,Patient,All of all of those all of the voices are some you know what I mean I don't know.
740.0,Provider,You know what I mean I know you're talking about. But. You make them harmony. You know. I used to teach a class called the neurobiology of. And the crazy part about it is. there's a there's a there's a piece that. People don't know. about the brain. And the thing about it is. Is that you control what you. Now you can't control what goes in your brain. But you control with phase and what leave.
16613.0,Patient,So how do I spell all this bad stuff.
740.0,Provider,"By putting in a whole lot of good stuff. I know it's kind of like man i'm gonna get you back on the fly, you can just have a. Look, for me, but if. I took a major thing as simple as possible ain't no point in me, I know what it means to pretend to do others prolific certainly don't make no sense and you can practice it. But I have never seen somebody try to move somebody into a room does not make it. So, in order for you to you know, be able to move into a room first you gotta wait for the people that say no to get out, then I got to claim it and make it suitable to know for you to go in there. same thing. I don't want to run out of bad stuff. You got to claim that first and then you got to put something and saying, because if you don't put anything else and you're going to revert back to what you know. it's the same way. Even you know go to the library you ever met us to check out a library. library book. And they give you an expiration may give you a date, the more you have to shake your booty becky and if not, after they stopped paying and late fees, you know, like do they sell them Lacey buffy. Within the crazy part about it is we bring you back in they give you an option, they say either you can check it, you know you can renew it. yeah right the crazy part about it is, is that if you chose to renew it, that means the date the actual expiration date no longer exists, they give you a new one. Which means you get a fresh. And then the old days never really existed, because I gave you a new one. same thing when you renew your mind. You got to be able to take that which was old. and push it by adding new thing. that's not the way it pushes you got to add stuff because of that what's the point of trying to get rid of something if you're not able to. put something in its place. Right you don't put anything in this case you're going to revert back to what you know. that's. I mean that's how ago. Basically, thought would say. They said that you can you can you can you can help a bird flying over the heat. But you can help you can you can so you can actually help it make to make sure it doesn't do the math. Controlling the bird flying over here. which you can make sure that i'm doing on this and you either. I think my thoughts. You can control what comes in there, but you can show the same or leave. It just the practice. yeah."
16613.0,Patient,it's just like a practice of being like all right. goodbye thoughts.
740.0,Provider,"Well, I wish. I wish it was that easy yeah if that's the case I wouldn't have a job okay. But it's not that easy it's just a practice and sometimes you got to get it right, sometimes you're not but the more you practice it, the more you realize the more you become very optimistic about yourself that's the whole goal is to be. optimistic about yourself about your perception about what you see about who you are about your dealings with people about your business these type of things and it takes work of course it's easy to be negative absolutely that's, the first thing we jumped on negativity. And it's hard to be positive. You know my one of my favorite colton feels is this is when in doubt do with Harvey. And the crazy part about it is, the more you do the hard thing, the easier it becomes. And the stuff that was easy becomes a hobby. Like i'm prejudiced saying someone so to the point to where to me if I say if I say negative if there was like a scene. Like are you paying you think they like the UK UK we don't want to be positive, we want to own IT and literally anybody that comes with something I always come up with a composite and I know I know it's been something that maybe we want you to wall with them, I can't do that."
16613.0,Patient,"No. But I mean i'm you know it's like well I have, for example, I noticed with my. With my sister who's. 12 years older than me and. I think my mom used to do this as well. And my brother doesn't do it as much, but we used to do it a lot, but I noticed with her still is like when we're on a facetime. it'll be like my brother got a haircut and she'll be like say something not that it's not negative but it's definitely a dig and i'm like, why is it always the first thing. And it really puts me off. But I don't say anything because I don't want to like I don't want to make her feel uncomfortable either, because I think that's something that's sort of like been ingrained or built in like you know. to criticize. To be very critical because our maybe our mom was quite critical in this way. Anyway, I try hard not to be credit I try not to say I try hard not to I try hard to keep. Like from saying anything. Critical or unkind I suppose."
740.0,Provider,The WHO to other people.
16613.0,Patient,To it to other people.
740.0,Provider,"Okay, I mean."

740.0,Provider,You should. yeah because it will help change this.
16613.0,Patient,yeah.
740.0,Provider,Of the same every you put it to being kinds of other people how about. Putting the same effort and see yourself yeah.
16613.0,Patient,"yeah I gotta do that, or else how i'll just be a hypocrite right."
740.0,Provider,A walking contradiction.
16613.0,Patient,But that's like also very Catholic I suppose I mean i'm an ex.
740.0,Provider,Catholic.
16613.0,Patient,"i'm an ex. Okay i'd rather I grew up. I grew up you know from fourth grade through high school went to Catholic school and I think you know there's a whole thing with Catholicism that they teach you where it's like you can sin, and then you can go to confession and then you're you have a clean slate."
740.0,Provider,And I night yeah I don't know.
16613.0,Patient,"But I mean that's why I feel like a lot of Catholicism like even when I was a kid it was really backwards, because there's."
740.0,Provider,So much.
16613.0,Patient,hipper there are so many just hypocritical.
740.0,Provider,"I don't. mm hmm I agree completely. Thankfully i'm not canceling. Oh, my gosh. yeah but. You only have good to other people, as you want to yourself. yeah that would you give to other people can you really say that is Jane when, if you don't do it for yourself. Can you really think that you're coming from a place of genuine care and can fire anybody you don't give it to your own so."
16613.0,Patient,"Do you think that that's something that can be like, if I know that it won't be something overnight, but if that's something that i'm continuing can continually practicing and aware of, essentially, I will be this. thing and it's not something that i'm. Thinking about."
740.0,Provider,yeah. If if it wasn't the case I wouldn't be. yeah I mean so say I know was not the right.
16613.0,Patient,You know I own you know it's I mean it's hard.
740.0,Provider,"it's right in the crazy part about it it's the simple stuff that's the most hardest stuff. Why, because we ignore these things. We dismiss these things we you know we'll we'll ignore the smallest thing and then go get a book about something greater. that we consider to be easier. But if it's a small simple things considered to be the hardest why, because these are the things that we've ignored for years. And that's the type of barriers that I am because I realized this the simple thing. that's the most powerful thing because it's always get overlooked. But i've discovered that when people do the most simplest things they'll come back to like leave me oh my gosh I. realized like i'm. telling you i'm telling you and that's the same, I discovered this for my own self because you think it costs to be harder than it, oh no we gotta be you gotta be a formula to the fact that it has to be signed, it is just people know is really nice. You know I used to watch barney when I was a kid I don't know you know who barney us but. I was bored when I was a kid you know barney taught all levels, how to be key. You know how to have manners and stuff and one of the songs I remember the most, you know that they have the phone and says, please, and thank you all the magic words. You know, please, and thank you all the words. And the thing about it is if they do you know, when you say, please, and thank you it's a long way. Now they don't even hear people say, please. They just rely on. But you know the crazy part about it is, is that if simple things like that they're born in total long time ago don't say they called you to be the person that you want."
16613.0,Patient,yeah.
740.0,Provider,The cause you to be polite and to have men. And values and things like that. And how to honor people and how they kind of know how to how to address it with the right way it's the same kind of simple type tactic that helps you be able to think better be better feel better do better. produce better all that kind of stuff and that's what i'm saying. It that's why I always say I know that my answers may or may not be be. But they difficult.
16613.0,Patient,"I mean, I definitely think I take care of myself a lot better."
740.0,Provider,"I agree, I read this stuff, and so the thing about is is the stuff that you listed that you do for yourself I think it's great, the problem is, is that. it's very domestic."
16613.0,Patient,It doesn't it doesn't stick.
740.0,Provider,"We can do something. Because we know we need to do it. versus, we need to be something. Because we know this is, who I meant to be. Doing and being two different things. yeah yeah you can do something, because it's fun to do absolutely. But the thing about it is, is that at the end of the day. Is that the person that you're trying to be. Why does why, why does what you do not speak into the person that you're trying to be because you're a fun person your interactive. Your time that you're all this kind of stuff so okay if that's if that's the attributes that you care to other people, then why you can meet a person to sail. You do fun thing. But it don't fit. into the person that you actually want to. Be that's what you want to produce. Because the person that you're that you want to yourself you're judgmental your heart to your heart and you said bj you judge a 70 criticizes you really, really tough on yourself and other kind of stuff not manager i'm trying to understand how we can go surfing, but we can't be. Now we can do. You see what i'm saying doing and being."
16613.0,Patient,yeah.
740.0,Provider,"it's possible that it's supposed to go the other way. Because I am a fun person, these are the things that I do."
16613.0,Patient,yeah.

740.0,Provider,"yeah the change would you believe about yourself. into the part in in be more. Be more. intentional. About. Who, you are what you like about yourself and who you're becoming. When you can appreciate the person that you're becoming the you become more confident yeah where you can appreciate the person that you're becoming been assessed to be confident when you can't appreciate the verse."
16613.0,Patient,yeah.
740.0,Provider,or when you don't know.
16613.0,Patient,Something I don't know.
740.0,Provider,"i'll course not, I know you know i'm just saying in general."
16613.0,Patient,yeah no but it's funny because I think about like when I think about who I think of when i'm being hard on myself and stuff.

740.0,Provider,"Okay now we're going to pause right there because that's that's the beat the subject for another time to when i've been with time but. I want to pick back up on that, though, because of the fact that we need to identify the root of where does that come from and why you see a carry that over. To say."
16613.0,Patient,"Well, I mean I mean I should let it go because I don't I I don't I think it was just like a really deep hurt that I felt."
740.0,Provider,It can be. Either that you felt that you feel.
