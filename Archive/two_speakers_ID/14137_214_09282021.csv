214.0,Provider,Why do you do LSD.
14137.0,Patient,I enjoyed the visuals. that's it like that's The main reason I do it is just I get a lot of visuals being an artist. I get a lot of inspiration ideas for.
214.0,Provider,How often do you use.
14137.0,Patient,"That one. I haven't done it recently um. We I would say, probably a good movie like every couple months like maybe every three or four months, like I usually do it at a shows, but even then, though I don't do it very often."
214.0,Provider,"Enough so that helps me there, so we were at this so let's talk about mental health if you don't mind, have you ever been treated for mental health."
14137.0,Patient,Like Institute.
214.0,Provider,"Know like counseling psychologist Dr you went to the doctor and said listen, you know. I don't know man like I you know I don't even I want to go to bed I don't feel like going to work or whatever inside of you have you ever went to somebody for mental health, because you said cannabis helps with the anxiety."
14137.0,Patient,It does help with anxiety i'm the only mental health that i've ever received was court mandated when I was 13 or 40.
214.0,Provider,"So, when you say anxiety you haven't been diagnosed, but you to you, you have anxiety right."
14137.0,Patient,"Oh no i'm so the person that diagnosed, it was a doctor recently i'm here in Washington so within the last two years, I was diagnosed with anxiety for my health care physician here."
214.0,Provider,And what did you did your health care physician prescribing medications.
14137.0,Patient,"They did what they said that I can take it as needed, since I don't have it every day like it's usually, when i'm under a fair amount of stress that I. feel like I would need it to call out."
214.0,Provider,And what's the medication.
14137.0,Patient,I have to go get it do you to go get it.
214.0,Provider,yeah.
14137.0,Patient,"it's called. A spiral bus pure one. Be U s P, I are Oh, and he."
214.0,Provider,Is from okay and what's the milligrams of fight on last.
14137.0,Patient,Five years.
214.0,Provider,"And, and when is the last time you've taken it."
14137.0,Patient,it's been a while.
214.0,Provider,"And is it fair to say, because I don't want I don't want to say this is what you're saying, has the cannabis been actually treating this and, therefore, no need for this medication."
14137.0,Patient,"I think it's a good alternative. Okay, I. Personally don't like taking medication every day. or. Doing taking pills every day like I take birth control, even then, though, like, I prefer not to but it helps in many other ways for me."
214.0,Provider,"Now absolutely absolutely well known okay alright, so this gives me an indication of this alright so. You started off by saying. that it was better and I didn't capture after, but it was a learning communication with my partner, and then you add a family later, so this is where we're still at correct."
14137.0,Patient,Yes.
214.0,Provider,"Perfect alright. So. When when we're thinking we have a communication issue, are we not able to verbalize it, or are we. angrily of combustion double verbalizing it."
14137.0,Patient,I think it's more it's a mix of things um I do know that I can get easily triggered or defensive um when certain things are brought up or communicated to me. um but then I also get frustrated and when I feel that i'm not being heard or understood and resorts to we yelling or getting really emotional.
214.0,Provider,"isn't understood that's totally. I think what I was trying if you don't mind. When I hear communication I hear. A lot of things that I processed by saying one is you know what was childhood like did we have a good modeling and sometimes we do sometimes we don't, this is not reflective of view right now. And usually we noticed that the modeling has been off as a child and children aggressively can talk, but when they get triggered or they become defensive there's something else that sparked again not talking about you just making reference right."
14137.0,Patient,Now I totally get it.
214.0,Provider,"Okay, so like I I, there is a diagnosis that's you know combustible and it's it's it's it's it's actually how someone reacts when they feel like this is the only way someone's. going to hear what i'm saying is by yelling like being I don't want to use the word aggressive because that isn't right or fair to you. Well, you know we get it's volatile it's very volatile because somehow or another, and something was parked inside and then you know, this is the way we protect ourselves with our Armor so I just wanted to get those those. That wording from you to understand you a little bit Okay, so do you think anybody in your home life struggles with mental health."
14137.0,Patient,"i've been told the from my mother, my grandmother suffered from major depression and I do know that there is some mental health issues on my dad's side, but he wasn't personally around, but I do know that we do know some of his family members that may either be bipolar or have. I think they said possible schizophrenia, but I can't quote I can't be 100% sure on that one, but I do know, like my grandmother from my dad side does suffer from like major aggression in science, like very hot or cold type of thing, but I don't believe she was diagnosed."
214.0,Provider,"Okay, and. Do you think you have any cross addictions."
14137.0,Patient,So sorry.
214.0,Provider,"Cross addiction so i'm feeling frustrated my anxieties taken up you lean into cannabis, because you believe. that's an ancillary spice that provides you a benefit right, but do you have any other things negative so then negative requested pictures of negative I use alcohol drugs or whatever, or you know, so you don't believe you have any right."
14137.0,Patient,"No, not at all like honestly I even try and refrain from smoking too much um because I know it does hinder my ability to do things like. Normally, or want to do things and all that other stuff the most the time I do is just to help call me down in a moment, but no I don't run to it, every time or with anything in general."
214.0,Provider,"Okay, fair enough. Has your partner so i'm using i'm trying to use the words respectfully as you use them, so you use a partner right has has this person said to you what they see in you, when you get volatile."
14137.0,Patient,"Plenty of times when a lot of people say things so but yes, he has said, some things to."
214.0,Provider,"me, are you internalizing them, or are you hearing them."
14137.0,Patient,"hear them and I do a fair share of self reflection um and I do understand that there are some things that I can do better at. Either vocalizing or communicating or at least allowing myself a space where I don't allow myself to be upset triggered um, but I do also understand that there are some things that. from his part on his side that."
214.0,Provider,"So what I heard was a two way street communication, a good flow of if you're going to give if you've got to learn to take if and we've got to learn how to do this. In a way, that's respectful not only to our relationship, but as to adults exchanging information, we need to be cognizant of how we may be. auditory really hearing things that are not comfortable to us is that kind of what's got is that kind of what you'd like to get into. Yes, okay fair enough and and thank you for sharing that alright, so what was good summer for me. What What was it like growing up as a kid in your family."
14137.0,Patient,"before the age of. six it was fine it was happy. It was at the time, is just my mother, my grandmother, and my. younger sister i'm living at my grandmother's house um no major things happened, but after the age of six as one my mom had found somebody that sexually abused me for seven years. And so that household is very chaotic, not a lot of communication arm. And a lot of these tendencies that my mom wasn't quite aware of, because she worked she was the provider she worked three jobs, he. couldn't hold down a job so most of the time he was kind of like the housewife i'm taking care of the kids but eventually at some point it got pushed on to me where I would take care of my siblings I would be the one cooking or cleaning or whatever."
214.0,Provider,"So, if I may just i'm only going to go back to some not all right now, so you actually were thrown into a role. That you not necessarily agreed to nor were you ready to accept that that age. Did you say you were sexually abused that six for seven years."
14137.0,Patient,Yes.
214.0,Provider,Have you ever addressed the trauma.
14137.0,Patient,"Other than the ones that the Court mandated no I personally have it, they mandated me to go to two types of therapy for at least a year or two years can't quite remember."
214.0,Provider,How did the courts get involved in mandating you to treatment.
14137.0,Patient,um I finally told somebody at the age of 30.
214.0,Provider,"Okay, all right understood. So I know this is a ginger topic and I, I will be very respectful of it, this is a component right that can be a major fracture. So it'll it'll ultimately be up to you how you want to address your fractures whether you think communication is first. Whether you like you know what maybe I don't even want to address this with you i'm not i'm not looking to entertain it, I want to be respectful that it's your journey and i'm here to help you with it. But just know that this, this is a major fracture right, and this is a fraction which, in the fraction sometimes when we're like. trying to figure out the answers why like Why is this happening Why am I, like this what's not happening in life, why can I give further. We know that these major fractures are a component of what's happening not necessarily all of it but part of it. And it's best to try to figure out when and how to address a fraction when are we ready for cast when are we going to go. You know, to get physical therapy these all metaphors for what I try to be very ginger on topics like post traumatic stress syndrome sound like what what is ultimately going to be the total care we want to give in and can we provide. Some concrete evidence that maybe that some of the things that are going on with communication or systemically. From the PT has the form, where you never had control, you had no validation there were a lot of things that were going on. known or unknown, but there are unresolved we hold them and maybe you want to do something with them, and you don't so that's just going to be my speech for now i'm going to let you determine how you'd like to work on that."
14137.0,Patient,"No, I completely understand. And I do know that a good deal of like communication my triggers and things like that do stem from that being not being heard or not be. Like allowed the control that I would like, in my life, and I know I can be very controlling a very a lot of handful of things i'm trusting someone to have that kind of control is extremely hard for me. From I do so yeah like I mean both of them would. would help me and I do know that solving the the trauma from my past would probably be the biggest. Help and it would definitely trickle down, but I would like both to be handled. I know i've been like avoiding it for quite a long time, like, I was 13 and i'm 32 now so. In a fair amount of time."
214.0,Provider,"Okay, so, can you tell me what sixth, seventh and eighth grade it was like."
14137.0,Patient,"A six seventh, eighth grade, I was in Emerson. Remembering certain things like that is difficult for me um. I don't know if i've just always had memory issues but it's just like certain things is just hard for me to remember in school, I know I at least did. well enough um. I usually was an A or B student um I was very soulful I did have a fair amount of friends. See Oh, I was a part of a program that they had just started in middle school. That focused on math and sciences. And I did really well in math and. sciences and so they created a class. One class they were doing a test run where they picked a group of like 20 to 30 students and they start coming to class and kept them in that class for the remainder of their. middle school years, so we really stuck with them for six seventh and eighth grade um as well as doing competitions every year for certain categories."
214.0,Provider,Your brain.
14137.0,Patient,"isn't these i'm mostly is, though, it was very rare that I brought with me, because I know my stepfather at the time didn't like it when I brought home a B."
214.0,Provider,"And, and what about your social ability, do you think you were social you had a group of fans like words was that."
14137.0,Patient,"i'm at the time in school, I was very soulful I hung out with had a group of. Think maybe 10 kids I hung out with, I think it was three know five girls and maybe about five or six boys that I hung out with consistently okay. But it was only In school I wasn't allowed to hang out outside of school um if I was, I had to ask permission, and it would only be for like maybe an hour after school and then i'd have to go."
214.0,Provider,And what was high school like done.
14137.0,Patient,"A high school. I still kept my grades up um. I was initially put into an honors English, but I didn't realize that. Oh, I didn't know that we had to do like some readings and stuff like that, so they have to just take me out of the class, since I do be too much reading to catch up on um but is, in my classes um. I was also very social um I was club President for at least two years of an anime club, so I was a part of clubs um did enjoy. My fitness classes, I did try out for track."
214.0,Provider,"Very. Very socially active. Yes, Okay, we graduated correct. Yes, did we decide to continue education was trade school."
14137.0,Patient,"The first two years after I graduated I decided to help them off so working helping her with taking care of my brother or sister i'm. So working to give her money for food and stuff like that, but after that I did go to college i'm completed my a liberal arts and then I had transferred to the art Institute to get my bachelor's college I graduated with a 4.0."

Like compared to the rest of my family, like, I think, out of all like he's probably the best relationship that I have not saying that my other family members are good or anything like that, but he's the one that I get along with the most because me and him have a lot of similarities."

214.0,Provider,"You also have to do the survey, those are like. critical that we have those done okay um i'll get that done and then you're supposed to see me twice a month, so what's your availability like."
14137.0,Patient,A currently I use my lunch to talk to. to talk to you or whoever i've spoken to um I usually work till 630 on Monday through Friday unless i'm doing crunch and then the hours can be pushed longer.
214.0,Provider,"For us. So, then, the reality is like six o'clock at night, is a good time 636 30 your time is a good time. Alright, so let me just see from them. Would would 7pm your time work for you."
14137.0,Patient,Yes.
214.0,Provider,"All right, so can we schedule an appointment for me and you October 13. And we said. my tongue. I live on East coast in New York City."
14137.0,Patient,Is it getting called it for you.
214.0,Provider,Oh no i'm in my house in Florida right now so.
14137.0,Patient,it's.
214.0,Provider,"yeah it's 90 years, so I think in New York, when I left it was mid 70s, it was you know we starting to make that transition over to the goal well."
14137.0,Patient,"yeah i'm in Seattle, right now, so that's what we're experiencing. The transition between nicole's."
214.0,Provider,"Sure sure sure alright any questions, for me, before we go."
14137.0,Patient,"No, I mean. Then, that I really have actually really enjoyed our talk."
214.0,Provider,"But good i'm glad, and I will make a strong attempt to have something tangible to say so, what do you think about this right. So i'd like to believe. The facts off for me, is when i'm working with somebody it's a partnership it's 5050 nobody holds a higher card. Nobody holds the lower card, everything is always respectful we listened to what we're trying to coordinate and it's always in agreement if we can agree and we put that away and we move to another one. I don't force therapy I kind of have my own little trickery that I do to move to a process and it not be so impactful right because my job is to. To be tender to be empathetic is not to be hard in rip apart things that supposed to be a seamless move, so my sessions usually only last 30 minutes and I think that that's beneficial. To a person, because after this person leaves me there alone for 13 days like is they only see me twice a month. If we have one hour sessions, you can open up a can of worms in one hour and then this person has to just. 13 days along so dangerous I do things a little differently, but they're strategical in in a benefit, but you know I will incorporate that to you and say so, what do you think about it so yeah that's how we'll work together."
14137.0,Patient,"When it makes a lot of sense i'm like not having such a bit I don't want to say investment, but like you said, opening up a huge can of worms and then just having to figure it out adjust and just have so much to process after that. So this."
214.0,Provider,"Okay, good, because a lot of people are like I want a longer session i'm like so you want it, you want more pain, because that's what this group is brings pain. Because brings uncomfortableness the springs I don't like being alone I don't know why I talked about it and we run the fear of someone saying I no longer want to discuss this, so I think if we do anything anything. it's my of putting our feet in the water ankle high knowing we won't drown, but we are in water and we can get comfortable with ankles and then we'll move a little above ankles and. Before you know will be waste time we wouldn't know how we got there, but all we know is that was safe when we're moving through it so that's how i'll work okay. awesome so then i'll see you on the 13th and if you in in the interim i'll have somebody reach out to you with the new group number and surveys that you need to do okay."
14137.0,Patient,"Okay, thank you."
214.0,Provider,awesome it was a pleasure Thank you so much.
14137.0,Patient,Okay.
214.0,Provider,bye bye.
