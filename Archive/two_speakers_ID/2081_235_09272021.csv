I got into it and I filled out my fastest thing so. I guess i'm going to be able to get to the loans to and I don't even like I looked up how much I owe it says zero like they're not even making me pay it back right now, where our income is so bad that. we're like there is no poverty is higher than us there is no line for us."

Actually, over two years, but it was like taking 12 units a day or 12 months a semester for 1234 semesters and to college classes per summertime it was like over 60 units and I was able to get a certification plus I took domestic violence and trauma but. yeah you just a couple of years and then you have to pass the state exam which will have to you know find out you'll get prepped on that on."
2081.0,Patient,"A really hard, is it, no, no, you."
235.0,Provider,"you're going to learn 1313 different disciplines, of being a counselor you know codes and ethics confidentiality you're going to learn about.

2081.0,Patient,So that. It starts in January.
235.0,Provider,"yeah spring semesters so that that means, if you take six units, you get half faster which, when I got out it faster was 50 $500 a semester for 12 units or more for classes. with you, I think, maybe just trying to take a couple of classes, because you got the kiddos so that's gonna you know find out what first you got to talk to a career counselor okay."
2081.0,Patient,"You know i'm i'm going to I looked up a bunch of places and I thought, like the best one I was just going through them and. I decided on the University of Cincinnati so I just started on."
235.0,Provider,"Oh Okay, they got it they've got substance abuse course over there."
2081.0,Patient,"yeah and it's all strictly online there's one where you can go to it, of course, but there's one that you can do totally online so."
235.0,Provider,whoa wait.
2081.0,Patient,They had a one I was looking at was like a Christian based one. But they wanted they wanted their their stuff you had to have your computer had to be apple like everything had to be after. yeah own sleep I hate it I hate apple like.
235.0,Provider,"Well, the reason is because apple has the most security."
2081.0,Patient,They have yeah.
235.0,Provider,Here already so.

Say apple you know android systems are even I i'm with you, I like android to my phone is android but as far working. The the apple is the one that that I use and. Now. I gotta leave ownership to where the scholarship was $500 for the laptop so you can apply for that once you get into the Program."
2081.0,Patient,"yeah I hope that that's what i'm trying to figure out like how they. Like. How they're gonna let me get that because I I can't find that you know there's no way, but like how how I can get it before I have to start like because I have to have it to start, obviously."
235.0,Provider,"Well, just I think the thing would be would check with the universe Cincinnati and. With the career counselor make an appointment with the with the virtual counseling appointment with the career counselor and see what all you need to have. To be able to qualify to get into that program they might have you know it might be able, you might be able to just go ahead and take that substance abuse. or with opioid use disorder program or what was our service date a DS addictive disorder studies that was the name of the the.
