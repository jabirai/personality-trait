My body is still here like going to the bathroom and stuff really weird because it just pan, you know here. yeah that was on Tuesday and I had to run errands and it was raining and it was like. I just told the kids I said, you see how carefully Oh, people can be. don't let it get you down i'm fine but yeah, but it was a. traumatizing."

9529.0,Patient,"yeah well not directly on obviously not directly on the kneecaps are beginning be gone. But I just told the kids they said keno wine my knees didn't break. Nice go like this with your leg, you know as an actor right back and forth as a glitch. So I thought I think it I just take it as a teaching moment. i'm personally."
383.0,Provider,very creative interview. yeah.
9529.0,Patient,yeah.
383.0,Provider,"So, are you taking a few days off so that."
9529.0,Patient,"I can't go, he asked her day off. yeah it was Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday and I took another day off today because there's just I just felt I need I was like traumatized. So when you think about it. I mean it could have been disastrous. You know, and it was, but it was kind of like somewhat disconcerting, I have to drop down and get my pen I dropped it. been resting resting and and then in the happen."
383.0,Provider,"i'm still here, I can still see you."
9529.0,Patient,"yeah okay I got it. Okay. So i'm and then my the company that I work for the district and they're rolling over to another company that will be handling the payroll and handling um did jobs and things like that, because obviously. i'm assuming they take your that the people that they have doing that could be better used in another capacity and they can you know so um. So it, you know, probably concept period between a lot of people but life happens, you know. You know. So you just didn't matter it's kind of a pain you're gonna have to do that everything over again, but it's very easy. it's just dealing with technology, and you know electronic signatures and why. All this stuff. So I can't get okay just stop you can do over the weekend. You don't need to do this now. So anyway i'm not sure what we talked about before we begin to talk about something and I actually forgot."
383.0,Provider,"yeah well actually so last week, I mean last time I saw you, you were very pleased because you had a positive interchange with your son. And so on related to your birthday, and so you were feeling really. and learn to bed, he is pursuing writing and. So. That seemed to be bolstering your mood and you did express some. struggles, where you live. With the values of the people in your area."
9529.0,Patient,"yeah they are. it's um. you're not um I don't know how to put this they're very they live. They only know what they know, most of them is they lived her all their life. Not all of them, but most of them it's. Being from Los Angeles your views, a little larger okay compared to. them. And, but yeah there's a lot of things that I, I actually have been we tried, I know that Todd todd's working he goes to work at four o'clock in the morning. haha any of these working as a teacher's assistant and the classroom obviously he's busy. mm hmm let's he's trying to get a book out. and Then he is with the wife had his Chariot little bit she's on the code codependent side. But then I really believe down. All of my sons are a little bit on the codependency. their father was still list. Okay, so."
383.0,Provider,"I think that's something that you said you wanted to talk about it was related to your your acts. And I think it might be, if you just wait one moment here, I can see if i've got if."
9529.0,Patient,"There was some audio issues have happened and i'm not sure what to do with it either concerning my granddaughter but. there's a lot of things that have happened, for example, as far as my ex husband goes. And he did a crappy job period and he didn't do a great job with his other kids from the other wife taser. Not that they're nobodies the bomber anything, nobody said drug addict but the point is he he didn't leave a sense of something for the kids to look up to some place for to go for wisdom. You know. And i'm not sure, maybe that's jack when do that himself, but oh now I remember about jack but what it was, is that. I have gone through it, I really feel that I have given him a large large token of grace for all of the crap that he has done, he has done some very toxic and vicious things to me, since our divorce and i've loved a lot of a go and there was one incident that happened with Todd. and Before he was going to do his sermon he invited me to come and see him do a sermon and jack's wife came up to me. And she was going to give me a hug. And so I saw that and not to embarrass her I just put my hand down, and I said hi Regina here like to shake her hand whoa she. got very upset by that. Like you know. And you know um. And then she proceeded to go into the church and talk about it. With the family that was there and gabrielle was there todd's wife who's super sensitive herself and always has got to look good and. hasn't quite gotten the graph that we screw up we make mistakes and we're going to continue to make mistakes and that's what separates us from God. But she takes you seriously and I think she was embarrassed and. My friend who was with me. Was upset because she didn't come over and say hi. And I said he realized he'd been gossiping and she's embarrassed. I said she didn't know what to do, I said I wouldn't worry about her but anyway, but this caused a lot of problems and shaq called up rob and said I don't like what your mother did at church. And what I did is I just put my hand down. Instead of hugging her, I mean it's not like she was that close to me I knew what she was going to do so, I just said hi Regina. and She didn't like that well that has caused."
383.0,Provider,A problem that you not want to give her a hug.
9529.0,Patient,"Oh hell no Why would. She she was very aware that my house has been taken away from me, she was very aware that my children are being manipulated for me, he has been very cognizant of everything, why in the world would I want to hug her cal know she also knew he got me fired three times now. Whatever reason that I have to hugger. I mean she's you know she's yeah anyhow I wasn't angry at her but damn no I don't want to hurt you. You know I mean you know I want to shake your hand, I will be cordial. i'll be maybe even talk to you Okay, but you know, no, no i'm not gonna asked her I who, but no hell, no, you do not get to be intimate with me no no Absolutely not. I look at hug says embrace. Of the acceptance and embrace of whatever and no I can't so just recently rob asked me if I could set up the. coven test form and he had no idea would be so you know extensive i'm in Oregon now he's in La so I needed information like his social security number, and all that, so I get column. And I caught him on where he was doing an estimate and I felt bad and I said I need the information so he gave it to me i'm like a dumb but I didn't write it down. So I just put it in, and whatever anyway, so I needed it again, so I called up. jack can Regina has placed the business and. Then she answered the phone and I said Regina is that I already called rob I said i'm going to need personal information do you have a social security, he said no, why would I. As the room, because he works for you that you have so scary she is no he's responsible for all that, and then I remembered that's right it's one of the reasons why a divorce your husband. Is because he's his teeth, the government I didn't say that I said oh okay and but i'd asked her I said cuz rob you know this is getting a covert test, and she said, oh yeah he mentioned something about that. And I gotta tell you that bothered me. You know um is that all I mean you just show alou for mountain. You know um but I didn't say anything but then keep bothering."
383.0,Provider,"Okay, can I just clarify it bothered you that."
9529.0,Patient,"She is such a cavalier attitude about it. possibility that he might have a coven. I said doesn't matter if he goes to the homes of your prospective clients, as long as you get your money. to hell with his house. And until with their health and this yeah that bother me. But I didn't say anything but it probably did prompt me because she said well you know I wouldn't you know. wouldn't we wouldn't have any endeavors and I said okay so good day. that's all I said. I just say good day. And that's it then jack call rob sound like your mother calling me, you know blah blah blah blah and I to Robinson once you tell them the next time. He tells you say you know dad and mom you are divorced i'm not your latest song if he has something to say to her why don't you call her and tell her. Tell. Anyhow, but so so always before I would always Okay, it was Okay, if he was going to be there and blah blah blah about no more. If I know that him and his wife, are going to be there, I don't want to be there, it day knew, when I was sat your entire got married I was set on the bright side in the back row. They knew it. So you know, this is no, no, no. No more the throne of grace is over okay I don't despise him but yeah if you're going to be at a certain time, let me know when you're gone so I can come, otherwise you won't come."
383.0,Provider,"Okay, so."
9529.0,Patient,"They don't get to be okay anymore okay that's it I even wrote a letter to them, years ago, email just saying you know, we need to discuss this as Christians things that have happened. And they never. They they never wanted to. They just want to bury it. Well, if that's Okay, if you bury it but could pooping on me Okay, then okay cuz thinking you're stirring up stuff i'm not so that's it and i'm okay with that. So I have no no. i'm not angry I just don't want to deal with anymore. So. Anyhow, tell so that was it about that was said about my acceptance."
383.0,Provider,yeah I just. want to just kind of. Ask. With regards you say you're not you're not angry and what i'm hearing is you're setting a clear boundary and you.
9529.0,Patient,send it yeah I am I am. Totally am righteously offended at two different things that have been done to me.
383.0,Provider,Okay.
9529.0,Patient,"And I don't wanna I ruin, you know more free passes."
383.0,Provider,"mm hmm. You know yeah and. I would. suggest or I observed that there actually is there is anger and that's Okay, I mean. That that you do have a anger about how you've been treated in the past. No."
9529.0,Patient,"yeah it was extraordinarily offensive the things that have been done. And Nino they feel that they have a right to express themselves. Look little you don't. Show I mean not without repercussions. And so now you have them. So. Then that's it, so I know that's going to cause problems or whatever I really don't care, there have been problems already was in my family and I have been very cordial been very nice and it really has worked. Just kind of looking at that that's that and where do we go from here."
383.0,Provider,"You you when you're with yourself wherever you are and you're reflecting on these events of the past. You are. Like from what you're expressing to me, you are. You feel angry about it. yeah yeah. sang offended in and because it keeps happening."
9529.0,Patient,"So you know if something happens one time even okay even another time but come on when you keep doing serious offenses like this is not a little things Okay, this is not like not shaking your hand Okay, this is like getting me fired three different times. This is, you know, putting me in the back row of a wedding when I should have been there when probably maybe in the front room. You know, because this is my son got married or doesn't matter so all these little. Things that they think they can do to me and my Todd never knew today know, two years later. That I was sat in the back row. So you know i'm I mean I didn't come up and say well you know at your blog that I never get that. I just shut up instructed in not. enough for not. Showing. Any."
383.0,Provider,"And the thing is, is that just for mental health. Mental health perspective if you know i'm as if we carry anger from an event that happened 45 or 50 years ago or 18 years ago. still unresolved situation because we're carrying that anger with inside."
9529.0,Patient,How do you resolve it.
383.0,Provider,"Well, in. That can be different for different people."
9529.0,Patient,or I can't write it down they don't want to resolve it.
383.0,Provider,"Right right but within yourself, because otherwise you I mean you can continue to carry. The anger and you likely will, as you said, you know you're really offended about what things that happened and those things that happened were a friends to you, they were disrespectful to you, they were hurtful to you. and and You were. upset likely then and continued to be upset about those treatments which were in fact disrespectful and hurtful and. A number of."
9529.0,Patient,amanda they didn't stop.
383.0,Provider,"My point is that your anger is going to live inside of you for the rest of your life with the situation, unless you decide that you want to somehow find a way to let go of it but, otherwise, it will be there inside of you. and"
9529.0,Patient,"Probably I probably need Maybe I should tell Ashley Ashley the reason why I left her wedding is because he was like deja vu then of me being sat in the back row of your uncle's wedding and when I was sat by myself at your wedding. led a table only by myself, it was really kind of hard for me. So, in order not to cry or get upset I left your wedding and nobody knew why, when I saw your mother in law, she said, oh do they buy CDs and emergency yeah so lovely wedding yada yada yada in our lab."
383.0,Provider,"Right so so we're solving our anger does not necessarily mean to. take it to the people or the that were part of the story. It doesn't necessarily mean that. In fact, often it doesn't but. i'm definitely looking at where we're still holding anger about the past is a worthwhile. endeavor. Because the thing is, is it does have an effect of making people bitter you know, a sense of bitterness about certain things that have happened and that persists. Over you know process it doesn't go away."
9529.0,Patient,mm hmm.
383.0,Provider,So.
9529.0,Patient,"Well that's why I think it's really best if i'm not around them. You know, so not now I an idea I feel actually kind of good. That now as far as i'm concerned i'm good excuse is never going to stop. You will continue to have conditions and the conditions are that if we're ever engaged together in anything anywhere if I say something that you don't like. you're going to. Take a Bulletin out about it. And I don't want to be around them."
383.0,Provider,"Right right so you're setting a boundary to protect yourself and that's really a healthy thing you know, because you you, these are not people that you can really that you can trust and they might do another hurtful thing. You know, and then that would just layer on another. memory and another thing to deal with that's very that's a that's a healthy setting a healthy boundary what I think what i'm just sort of reflecting back to you is that some of the anger from the past still sits inside of you and who's going to is you know kind of. It you can. Look, to resolve that or or not, but it is an energy, you know of. that's present. yeah and your body and in your mind."
9529.0,Patient,"yeah. No, I guess i'll have to. look into that. You know and make sure that I know what to do you know, like you know these are true, things are not made up things there are things that happen, and they continue to happen and probably a lot of that would do to well, first of all. He had or not been assigned to trying to find your testing thing for rob and putting it happen okay buddy is that rob song yeah."
383.0,Provider,"well. Actually. it's you mentioned about the codependency and. It does seem a little bit I mean he's a full adult and configure out these things. To ask you to do it is is you know I, I wonder why he wouldn't have just say."
9529.0,Patient,"He had the only thing I could think of is that he did, is he said he had a couple estimates back to back and he wanted to make sure that he got a covert test, because he covered. covered a shift and later found out the person T covered head coven that's why he's covering the shift so just to save guard from the other job."
383.0,Provider,"Oh yeah I mean it makes a lot of sense that he would want to get tested, but to ask you to set that up in a difference you're in Oregon and you may. go down to La that is. that's it could you could have made the choice to say rob i'm sure you can figure i'm sure you can do that, you know."
9529.0,Patient,"Right I didn't I didn't know I figured well I just Google it and find it and just get to them and say you can do it here. You know, but the point is, is he could have asked them. But he didn't. And the reason why rob and Craig and Todd do not ask jack. Because they are not a reliable source."
383.0,Provider,"Right, but he works for him right."
9529.0,Patient,"He worked for him, yes. yeah he'll do estimates for him, and along with his other job."
383.0,Provider,mm hmm.
9529.0,Patient,But in the only reason he gives this mid form now is because jack is afraid to go out by himself. So it's not the love of his son to help him make money. district be selfish.
383.0,Provider,Okay.
9529.0,Patient,"period and rob knows that I haven't discussed it rob rob said. I won't say anything Okay, but that's how jack is jack is very self encompassed. Any marriage is some somebody who loves us to happen so when I was married to jack and he treated his family ill, I told him, you can't do that. You cannot do that. But he's very just somebody who. is afraid to say anything to her. In fact, he told me that she wants to be a teacher, but she has to be in the business answering the phone as well, one she just told me he will Monaco, be a teacher. And you know work it out. There guess she doesn't have the competence do that and I wonder why is she talking to me about this. i'm in the ex wife. For you're talking to me about this. And then only tells me that she's desperate has nobody else to talk to him."
383.0,Provider,"Right So what do you, what do you feel like. How, in terms of your own therapy in. What is it you, you want in terms of. Working on this in your own therapy session."
9529.0,Patient,"I just um. there's a lot of things that i've been putting up with or. um I have to say yeah i've been i've been putting up with a lot of things. And so. um and, unfortunately. You know, we I had an. craig's praise wife. daughter had her baby. and You know i've gone ahead and sit Matthew a gift. That his stepson because I figured well if Craig wants to be mad or something about this, I I don't you know there's, not that I don't care, but. I between you and a 16 or 17 year old boy who needs operation. Well, you, you do not okay you do that, you get new from your wife and you're getting it from yourself, I guess, but that kid is not so I went ahead and I included him and I think that told you, I was making cookies. uh huh Okay, well, I sent my cookies out. and You know that just in math math it wasn't good It just shows Ashley Ashley did not see anything when Ashley is another well anyway ashley's the latest thing now but. dd sent me a picture of her of her new baby. Her grandbaby. uh huh and. So he's very cute and she told me his name. And I said, you know just you know, did you know I really am glad i'm sure to be a good grammar. So um and, of course, when I found out, we sent her against. You know so i'm in that's what you do right. That is what you are supposed to do as a family unit somebody share something with you all, be it, I guess, my relationship with dd right now said a text level. And maybe it'll stay that way or were there i'm not going to really be concerned not too much I can do about it. So. But in the meantime, I have a granddaughter that we are very concerned about. i'm very, very concerned about her. She has a very. Controlling mother in law and controlling mother."
383.0,Provider,"Okay, so i'm just going to ask you again and."
9529.0,Patient,You know.
383.0,Provider,"took what does this what is, how is this related to your individual therapy, what is it."
9529.0,Patient,"really well because. I would feel really bad. If something happened to Ashley. And like she committed suicide. Now is that a possibility yeah. Unfortunately, yes I think so she very withdrawn. has become very withdrawn and I go so."
383.0,Provider,"So do you have a relationship with her, do you."
9529.0,Patient,"Have a very, very. Close but no not since she's got married you're."
383.0,Provider,"Okay, so she's married and you did have a close relationship with her, but you don't anymore. Right and so, in terms of. For you, in terms of you're talking about this in the session is this. So that you break that distance and and reach out to her directly about how she's doing or do you just know through other people about how she's doing."
9529.0,Patient,"And nobody really knows her she's going and according to rub Craig according to he spoke with my friends and Michael and Michael said that Ashley in her father. She has nothing to do with a father now she's angry at him. Okay, so."
383.0,Provider,"So this is, to some degree it's being information that's coming from rob who's getting some of this information from. Craig right."
9529.0,Patient,"No, not from Craig."
383.0,Provider,Okay.
9529.0,Patient,"No robbed us and ask Craig and I certainly can ask Craig okay so um I unfortunately. amanda what happened in this family is that jack dropped the ball. He gave his children no skills for reconciliation, for being able to talk things over. I have us. out and they had children and they're doing the same thing."
383.0,Provider,"Today, and this is all beyond your control right."
9529.0,Patient,Online control but. I can bake cookies and I said send notes and say that you're cared about and I care about you know expectations of hearing anything back from them.
383.0,Provider,"So this is what you've been doing, and this is what you continue to do choose to do. Because you don't have control of how they're that these dynamics and. How they're going to respond or not respond and what they're really engaged doing in their life."
9529.0,Patient,"I think they're pretty well all not doing that right, I mean they're coping you're going through coping. In their life and."
383.0,Provider,And that you write is out of your control that they're not doing that great.
9529.0,Patient,"Right it's out of my control. But what's in my control. is to let them know there's a window, you should door. there's someplace you can connect with there's not gonna be judging. And that's just just going to have an open door reason just come in and."
383.0,Provider,Do you think that they're aware of us.
9529.0,Patient,"and Canada. You know um. I just don't think they know i'm like Michael Michael you know was when I keep out the cookies, you said you know yeah Thank you and you know, Colin said, thank you Nicholas didn't. I don't think out of selfishness, I just think he's pretty overwhelmed."
383.0,Provider,"Right and so. What i'm hearing, though, is that for you, it is meaningful for you to get a response back."
9529.0,Patient,"But i'm not going to not do it because they don't respond uh probably this will be the first year that Nicholas will not get homemade cookies for me, for his birthday. um and you know another little gift, he will probably get a card. You know that he can buy something on Amazon and that's about probably all that i'm going to put into it, why because he doesn't respond. Okay, and you know um I can bake cookies for other people, you know baking cookies is very time consuming."
383.0,Provider,"right and it seems like you do get disappointed when you don't get a response. Here, so that can contribute also to feeling like your family is not treating you very well when you put yourself out, so what i'm sort of trying to kind of. move in the direction of is. What can, how can you manage the feelings and emotions that are get stirred up in you related to your family and putting."
9529.0,Patient,The only.
383.0,Provider,"So. We don't have too much time left and disappointment is getting close to the end of the appointment. I just think that this is something to look at you know, because you could tell me a lot of different scenarios of how your family is dysfunctional or not. You know, treating you well, it hasn't. But that doesn't necessarily resolve the emotions of. hurt within you, and since the therapy is about you and how you know what can you do or not do to manage your own emotional landscape."
9529.0,Patient,"hmm well I do know one thing will i'll. i'll write about this and I guess next time we'll talk about it, but the only thing I can on the bottom line is if something happened. To anyone in my family."
383.0,Provider,"yeah so you said this before and i'm aware of it, if something happened you wouldn't want them to feel that you. you've made that pretty clear and how you engage with them, I think that."
9529.0,Patient,"Right, but you really don't have any choice either you can stop and not do anything and then you know, then, if you don't do anything and you don't get any. Thanks or whatever before Destin are going to happen okay okay."
383.0,Provider,Talk about this in another appointment. But I just want to note that there's some some surveys that need to get get you back in the green.
9529.0,Patient,"Okay. I here's what happened with the Wednesday. Okay, I i've been working so I haven't been able to to go um I did redo the survey when I did the last time I was there to wednesday's ago but i'm also will soon and go every other week so Shan chow said she was going to put me on her list, I guess, he has. A group that meets later. During during. During the day and after that would accommodate my been able to work."
383.0,Provider,"Okay okay well that that would be good, I think. You can probably go ahead and submit these surveys."
9529.0,Patient,Okay.
383.0,Provider,"The group, whether you go to the later group or the earlier one."
9529.0,Patient,"I let me understand this and, even though I only go every other week I need to do, distribution, every week."
383.0,Provider,"I believe, so I believe you, you need to do them for your appointments if, to the best of your ability that's."
9529.0,Patient,"Even if I don't have an appointment just do it anyway, once a week I."
383.0,Provider,"Think they're supposed to be done once a week but double check with the virtual clinic on that. yeah and so, in terms of making another point with me we're really close here to the to the end of this of our time so."
9529.0,Patient,I think we already have learned. I think so.
383.0,Provider,"Okay, let me just take a quick look I. Okay yeah you're right we've got one on the 14th."
9529.0,Patient,Right. OK change there.
383.0,Provider,For 50.
9529.0,Patient,yeah what i'm sorry for. For 15. yeah that's October. My phone's been acting up today. So. That is. The 14th.
383.0,Provider,"Yes, yeah. yeah so take care of your body you just were in that jolt of a fall, so I hope that you know i'm glad you're taking some days off of work to kind of recover from that. yeah yeah."
9529.0,Patient,"No, I am i'm going to work tomorrow but. Because it's a special ED class and it's very hard to get people to cover those."
