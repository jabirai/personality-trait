120.0,Provider,"Okay. I imagine you're tired. it's a race to the end, sometimes. feels like that. For sure how are you feeling about how this semester went in general."
16059.0,Patient,"i'm feeling good about it, I have all a's so i'm proud of that, and I had to drop a class not like earlier on, to make time for this program as well, and I was disappointed about that, but I am glad that I don't have to worry about it now."
120.0,Provider,"mm hmm yeah good good. Good this is, this is a class and of itself going through this program you know it's a lot of work. A lot of a lot of stuff so. So you're tired. and Like both physically and emotionally."
16059.0,Patient,mm hmm.
120.0,Provider,How do you think you've been doing with food this week.
16059.0,Patient,"it's been very difficult this week i'm stopping going that well i've been feeling pretty down as well lately, like the past couple of weeks. Usually, a little bit messy but. yeah that definitely goes now."
120.0,Provider,Tell me more about how you like feeling down like kind of depression or. This. or.
16059.0,Patient,I guess a little bit of like depression type symptoms i've never like. Like that for really but kind of been feeling like that recently i've just like feeling really down. and motivated like just can't shake the feeling of like being down.
120.0,Provider,"yeah. it's hard you know and. You know, especially when you're. you're not seeing you know kind of I mean do you see the purpose for this hard work that you're trying to do like do you see like that you're making progress, or is it kind of like Why am I doing this."
16059.0,Patient,"No, I definitely like I see the purpose of doing it."
120.0,Provider,Okay.
16059.0,Patient,"it's just like I see a lot of progress with like things with my dad kind of like the got on that and. Then, not much with like the eating itself."
120.0,Provider,"yeah yeah yeah we got to figure out how to help you with that. Like what, what do you think you, you need. What does your gut tell you."
16059.0,Patient,"really sure I mean I like i've tried, a lot of different things with like. Setting the alarms having recovery records and new minders having support with my mom having squirting group, like for eating thing and then queuing and I have kind of made like a more structured meal."
120.0,Provider,plan hmm.
16059.0,Patient,"So last week it was like. she gave me some ideas kind of to do, like last week and then for this week we went through at our equipment last time, and we did like okay for snack you're going to have a high bar and dried cherries and things like that and it's not really been helping that way either. Like are you."
120.0,Provider,"Are you doing it, or do you know what you're going to eat you just don't need it."
16059.0,Patient,"yeah. Okay, like it's like I just feel very paralyzed at times like not not able to. Do it."
120.0,Provider,"Okay, all right um. Did you and Kelly and talk about your weight."
16059.0,Patient,"kind of yeah that's that, so I am a medical appointment last week on Wednesday, after this movement, and I was very surprised, but Dr Anderson said that I had lost a couple of pounds."
120.0,Provider,yeah homie I talked to her about it. Okay yeah. And that was right after you've been home.
16059.0,Patient,yeah.
120.0,Provider,"And you tell me a home that you need more, because your mom was kind of on your case about it. And i'm hoping that that is testimony to you that your body needs more food because. You know that your perception of what you're eating and what your body's doing is worked, you know that you're in it, because I thought, my understanding is you probably were thinking that you gained weight."
16059.0,Patient,"Oh yeah I thought I had gained. A lot of weight, like my my body image, I feel like I haven't really been seeing myself accurately really. yeah like I thought I had gained like 15 pounds."
120.0,Provider,At means yeah yeah.
16059.0,Patient,"No, no that's not logical."
120.0,Provider,And you've actually got the opposite direction. yeah you know it's not even just that you didn't gain is that you lost.
16059.0,Patient,yeah.
120.0,Provider,How did it feel when she told you that.
16059.0,Patient,"I would start like my mouth literally like. Open I was not expecting that at all, because to mention it until the very end, when I was getting ready to release she's like Okay, so you asked a few pounds that was like. And it wasn't even just like a little bit of weight, she said it was like a few pants. I don't know what it really was but. it's very surprised. And then I kind of felt reassured a little bit of like Okay, I can do this, I can do this and I don't have to worry about."
120.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16059.0,Patient,"Like a weight, but then, on the other end it was like I kind of felt proud kind of felt."
120.0,Provider,"Like isn't it yeah because there's a part of you, you lose weight you're like yay then yeah."
16059.0,Patient,And there's that other part of me that's like okay now to do anything you can to keep going that way. as well.
120.0,Provider,"mm hmm yeah because you know there, there is. um you know there's a lot of different kinds of theories and approaches to this, and one of them is to know your weight, I have a couple patients that have done better when they knew their weight, because they recognize wow I do have to eat more you know. Because they never believed us when we were like you have to eat more you know and they're like I don't need to blah blah blah blah blah, you know. And I actually recognize the basic we gave them a concrete range is that your body needs to be in this range, for your body to be. You know, like functioning at a normal level or a healthy level and it wasn't until they actually measured it themselves that they could. prove to themselves, and that was actually helpful for them, because then they can use their perfectionist tendencies to shoot for that range. You know kind of like if you're given like like like at school, if you're said that this is the this percentage isn't a this percentage is a be this percentage is a see you know if you kind of know where you stand. You know kind of like at school, if you're given scores, and you can see where your greatest and you can see where you're at you recognize where you're going off track. Instead of just them, saying do a little differently this way do a little different this way and you're like well what what's my grade you know, like you, don't know yet so. You know that is an option, most people like i've been worried about letting you know your weight, because I think it's going to send you for a loop. But you know it could be a motivator to, but you have to be committed to staying in that range kind of like shooting for the a instead of being like yeah i'm happy to see you and it's great you know kind of thing."
16059.0,Patient,"or whatever yeah because when I was at like with you event we I was given a range, and so I was told my way. Think. every Friday we had my checks to go in. And so I knew on Fridays, and then on Tuesdays we would do it at home, so I. I saw it, and I heard it. So. Like I just I always wanted to be on like the lower end of the range and I could not go above range, I felt like and. yeah I don't I don't know."
120.0,Provider,I mean were you able to. Accept the you know staying at the lower age were you able to say I need to eat it like was that was that helpful for you. Or did it worse.
16059.0,Patient,"I think it was kind of both because, on one hand, it was like giving me permission to eat and stay there."
120.0,Provider,yeah.
16059.0,Patient,"But then, on the other hand, I felt like it was too high, so like I was constantly kind of battling that with myself. Like. On nba. games too high."
120.0,Provider,"Right right. You know cuz I like I said generally most the time we do blind weights and most of the time. That is what's recommended or it has been. Historically, in traditional eating disorder treatment that's kind of the approach that they usually take you know, but there is another train of thought which is. i'm having you know your way and practicing accepted of that because I think that you're kind of in this magical world of i'm supposed to be a lower weight. And that is absolutely a lie. That is it point blank lie. And so, one of the things you have to do is kind of wake up to the reality that you're not 14 you know. When you were 14 maybe your body was that size, because you know when you're like because the kid your body changes like your body should be bigger than it was when you were you know 1112 1314 like that kind of thing. That is. That is what is reality. And you know there and part of you is going to have to you know they call that radical acceptance of this is what my body is."
16059.0,Patient,You know.
120.0,Provider,"It doesn't matter, what I do to it if I can't put on pretend pretend glasses and be like Oh yes, I should be a lower weight, because that is completely a lie."
16059.0,Patient,yeah we just talked about radical acceptance last night action.
120.0,Provider,"huh yep. Radical like like I am i'm five foot 11 i'm a crazy tall my shoe size is 12. I can't find women shoes that fit me. Like I can't make they don't even. Most places if you go in person, the highest ago was 11. yeah and payless used to have like one i'll or one thing of 12. And, but then payless I think about a business now. That, at least this around here I don't know, and so I always have to get guys use, I have to buy 10 men men 10 and a half, because that's what fits me. And I but i've accepted that. i'm like I don't even bother looking at women shoes, because they don't make them, and so I try to find men shoes that. That I feel like aren't horribly masculine in."
16059.0,Patient,Nature yeah.
120.0,Provider,"You know I had a guy at the hospital that day, a patient, that was a he was a jackass but he's like. you're you're you don't have to wear your shoes are really masculine he was saying things like that and i'm like yeah I know you know, but like years ago that might have kind of like been like motor of shoes, you know it kind of it could have done that yeah. But I also know, he was being a jerk. And also, it is true, my shoes are more masculine because I I don't have a lot of choices I can't affect my size of my feet and so that's an example of kind of a radical acceptance. You know. So you, you have to figure out how do I accept that my body needs to be at a different weight than I would want it to be."
16059.0,Patient,You.
120.0,Provider,"know what do you think about that idea because that's. The value of knowing your weight is, you have to you also have to practice acceptance of it, not just knowing it be like nope that's unacceptable, I have to make it lower, you know that that's part of what you're struggling with. Is you know you're going to have to accept. You know it's kind of like. You know, if you want the sky, to be read it doesn't matter how much you want it to be read it it's blue, you have to accept it blue."
16059.0,Patient,yeah.
120.0,Provider,"You know, or if it's snowing outside and you really want to go. To the pool, and if you want to you want to go sunbathing. It doesn't matter how much you want it. doesn't matter how badly, you want to go to the pool it's snowing you know, so you kind of that's an example of like I can yell and scream and cry I can run out there and sit in my bathing suit and be like i'm going to make it be warm you know it doesn't it's not going to do it."
16059.0,Patient,"yeah it's just like and I feel like I. I kind of felt that way back in like maybe. March or something maybe april's here like dang I really wish I could but. uh huh like kind of like. I feel like it was a very brief timeline like that and kind of changed because I don't I kind of felt like that, because, like that's the only based kind of sounds like. A mom you say their machines making say there. can't do anything, then like once I got more of that control back, I think it was like okay. Like I actually can do it now."
120.0,Provider,"yeah well and and and another reality that. It is a reality is that is true, you know you, you are an adult you do not have to be in this program. do not have to be in any Program. You know, you can starve yourself to death, if you wanted to. You know, like you, you have that. That is that is a choice you know just like you could go start using cocaine, do you want it to. You know they're there are consequences like it would really damage your relationship with your family. You know, particular your mom because she worried sick and she'd be on your case, all the time. And you would have that you know, but you could do it, you know nobody's going to force you. You know, you would probably end up in a hospital once in a while, but even that you know you, you can you don't have to be in a hospital, you can AMA you can leave and be like I don't care I don't I don't want to. i'd much rather be said, so you can go out and be completely alone in the world, but you're thin you know, like you have your i'm sin, you know, like like that is the ultimate goal of your life, you could do that you know if you want. You don't have to follow anybody suggestions you don't have to follow Dr Anderson you don't have to follow your mom you don't have to follow us, you know you can do what you want. But you know as people that care about you. probably more than you care about you. And the hope is that you will trust that you're that you need to let other people help you. make those decisions, because your your perception is kind of worked, but you know, there are a lot of people that say screw you all i'm going to go do what I want to do anyway. You know people do that you know they don't usually it doesn't usually turn out real well for them. You know, so that part of it is you have to decide. Whether you're going to trust your eating disorder mind or the voice of your team."
16059.0,Patient,yeah.
120.0,Provider,You know.
16059.0,Patient,"I feel like I really do trust voice and 19 I just feel very stuck like very like I guess just that paralyzed where I think it's a good way to describe it like I know what I need to do, I do, that I can get my snack out and then I sit there and stare at it. So. it's almost as if my mind and body act on separate terms at times."
120.0,Provider,"yep yep. yeah they do because. You know you're it's it's very much like that. That ambivalence is both of those things, or two, at the same time. And you know that that is the you know the essentially that horrible part that are the horrible thing that eating disorders are. Is that you know, most people with most addictive type behaviors don't want to keep doing it, you know I mean they want to, because it's an addictive part but they're not like proud of it, you know, but an eating disorder, you know society praises you for being thin and so. You know if you had a pornography addiction society's not like yay you keep doing that that's a great idea, you know. Like you'd be like, I want to be done with this so badly, you know, like it wouldn't it wouldn't be praising you but in an eating disorder it's crazy that society kind of praises illness."
16059.0,Patient,mm hmm. yeah.
120.0,Provider,I mean it's crazy that you can look at a woman's magazine and see. An article about loving your body on the very next page is a diet at. hmm yeah.
16059.0,Patient,"It can seem like we watched a video last night also and Catherine like these, acting crazy."
120.0,Provider,Do what which video was.
16059.0,Patient,Killing us actually.
120.0,Provider,Going a softly yeah.
16059.0,Patient,yeah like the fourth one.
120.0,Provider,"yeah that's it's a good one. But you know eventually you kind of have to figure out which team you're on. You know whether you're on ed's team, or whether you're on. Recovery team, or whatever. So. I agree with you, I kind of. went in talking to Dr Anderson and colleen. And I agree with you that you're making a lot of progress in the emotional realm I think you're doing really good at recognizing where some of this has come from. And I wanted to give you the assignment today of writing a How dare you letter to your dad. And because I know that you've never really had a voice there and I want you to kind of go ape shit on this letter you know. And like. I wish I had you in person, because I would go outside and just smash ice cubes and check them against the wall and you know throw it as hard as you can tell your arm falls off or whatever, like, I want you to write out how dare you letter. Because I do think that. that that is a big source, I mean I mean there's a combination of your temperament which is you're a pleaser you're kind of passive you're. You know, want to be good, and so you're kind of you know, being thin is kind of in your mind probably you know similar to being wholly being good being clean to being Look how good I am kind of thing."
16059.0,Patient,yeah.
120.0,Provider,"And I think that that part of your temperament is like that you're harm avoidant as i'm i'm that way to I want, I want to be like good i'm gonna be i'm gonna do my best, you know. um, but we have to awaken the other side of you have out there, that this sucks what the hell, you know and to get kind of angry at it. You think about it you're probably secretly really pissed off. Because you know i'm eating disorders are frequently anger turned inwards because think about how freakin mean you're you're a mean person. To yourself yeah extremely mean to yourself, and I did that, what do you how do you feel when I say that to you."
16059.0,Patient,yeah I mean I definitely agree with it.
120.0,Provider,"Okay. Okay, because I want because it your initial thought is that, like i'm not mean i'm really night, you know, because you are nice on the outside. But you're very mean. on the inside. You know, and so we have to help you take that meanness and find a different outlet for it. For the anger and turn it outward."
16059.0,Patient,yeah.
120.0,Provider,"um. But I also. agree that you know you might mean so so here's here's a Kelly, and I were talking and Dr Anderson we're talking, you know about higher level of care. And we do think it's probably a good idea to do an intake with them, because I feel like there's a part of you that kind of wants that anyway, is that the case like is there a part of you that kind of wants a break."
16059.0,Patient,"kind of I mean I feel like. I feel like it was kind of how it was with this, I op like I was like I don't need that right now. And it's like I gave them with acid might be nice and then I was like okay let's do it, and I feel like the more I hear it mentioned on like. I could see how it's helped one like hearing like olivia and katie in and everyone like talk about their experiences in it like I just feel like there's a big difference in the mindset so last. night I feel like could be helpful from something like that, but."
120.0,Provider,"yeah well, I mean and and I agree with that, like one of the benefits of. In higher level of care, like an Inpatient program is you get thrown in the deep end really quick. You know, because you don't have the option to make your own choices. You know. You you kind of get thrown in the deep end really quick and so you kind of go from zero to 60 really quick and then you stay at 60 met you know i'm just making a metaphor. And then, when you discharge, we as I O P help you to try to stay at that 60 you know, to keep Isla like olivia's doing that right now she's trying to white knuckle it she's trying to stay on her meal plan she's trying to. Keep eating the meal plan that she had when she was in a higher structure. You know and and so you know you go from zero to 60. What what you're trying to do is you're trying to go from zero to 20 to 30 to 40 you're trying to work it on yourself, without being thrown into 60. You know. you're trying to kind of increase your speed you're trying to kind of match it on your own. But in a higher level of care you're just tossed in there, and you don't have to work your way up. And, and I think one of the things that's difficult for you is because you're a people pleaser i'm sure that if you get thrown into higher level of care you'll be like yeah i'll do it and you'll be star student, you will do it well because that's your nature. You know. And so I think you'll be able to do it, I think you'll gain the weight, you need to I think that you will maintain the way you need to. I think you'll do it because everyone is there, ready to applause you know there because you're kind of like your pleaser you know you want to do the right thing and also you don't have other options. You know. And, but right now, you don't when you have us kind of harassing you a little bit you know, but you have to do it, you know, on your own there's nobody there to you're not going to lose privileges, if you don't you know high level of care, you might lose privileges, such as phone calls. You know, or you might lose the ability to to walk sometimes if you're that sick they'll make you be in a wheelchair things like that, like depending on the program some are. Pretty or harsher than other ones, but good it's good, and if you need that. And so. You know my concern one is that if you go to a higher level of care. And it's just going to be about everybody else. But that's okay if that's what it needs to be that's okay. Because that might be where you're at, and then we would work on the other end of with iot as a step down instead of a step up. yeah you know. So that would be a thing, and the other would be. That. It would. The other thing that i'm worried about, though, is that. i'm worried that you don't think we believe in you, if we recommend higher level of care, because you know, I think that you are very capable of this and I want you to know that you are capable, because I don't want you to think that you're not capable. of it. Some a little bit worried that if we keep pushing for a higher level of care that you'll be like well i'm too sick, you know but there's a part of me to that also makes maybe you kind of want that maybe you're needing to prove that you're sick enough, you know."
16059.0,Patient,"To me, that."
120.0,Provider,"You know kinda like we talked about with your dad you know, like he never believed that you had a problem, and maybe you do need somehow to validate that by being in a program I don't I don't know."
16059.0,Patient,"yeah I definitely resonate with a lot of ways, because I feel like there is. Like some some sort of validation that would come from the. Because no kind of like prove to. My dad or whoever that, like you, like this is real."
120.0,Provider,"yeah that you're hurting. you're in pain you're hurting and because you're you haven't had a voice, and so I think there's a way that you're trying to say that how you're running the high desert How dare you letter, through your actions. yeah there if I get sick enough if I almost die, maybe just maybe he will notice."
16059.0,Patient,"yeah and then like that the like feeling like you said, like if you guys all recommend it, then I would feel down kind of but. I definitely feel that too, because it feels like why can't I just do it, you know, like it's like I just feel so stuck on that why can't I just have one on one. Like everyone else's calling their meal plan for the most part, at least, like like why can't I just do it definitely doesn't make me feel like kind of makes me want to beat myself up a little bit about it. But every time it's mentioned at least earlier on, it was like oh. But now like, as i'm hearing more it doesn't carry that much weight, but definitely still listening."
120.0,Provider,"Right. So um Dr Anderson. texted me and also feels that maybe we should have you go ahead and do an intake because the waiting list is like three weeks. At least for the facility that she I don't know which one she was looking at, but it depends on what is in your insurance. So if we're going to take that route we. You know, especially if you're hoping to go to school next semester, you know we have to get on this because you're not going to be able to otherwise. you're going to be on the whole semester next semester. Because that's kind of the reality of it. Unless somehow your school offers like online stuff because you know if it does, like I know my college offered. independent study that you can do at your own pace, and so I did a lot of it actually while I was in treatment, because we always had study hours in pay in when I was in treatment. Where people could do. assignments like therapy assignments or people could read a book or whatever like you know, there was some downtime so it, especially on the weekends, and so you know you might be able to you know do some of your work that way I don't know I don't know what your school offers."
16059.0,Patient,"I mean with coven and everything right now, as a big big thing are definitely having it. haven't really looked into it. Much with the classes, that I signed up to the currently take but Dr Anderson did mention like last week, she suggested like it might be time for high level care, I was like. She said something about like helping me figure out how you can delay the start. But then I don't know it's like all that work would pile on later. What."
120.0,Provider,yeah yeah I don't know how it works that's why I don't you might have to you know talk to you have a. counselor or anything at school or. yeah.
16059.0,Patient,"I have like a general advisor the advisor I had left the College, so I just have like a randomly assigned one, but I do have."
120.0,Provider,"It might be good to make an appointment with them. Especially before you. Go home, for you know this semester or whenever you're done. and say hey, this is a reality, I very well could be going into a treatment facility, you know and it, it could be two months to two and a half, three months, sometimes to be in a in a facility to where you'll be unable to attend the classes. and Even if you took classes online, so if the classes require you to be at a certain place at a certain time, like if they're just live, you know that probably wouldn't work because you don't know what the schedule is at the facility. know, and so it would have to be a class where you watch videos and then you do assignment like you do at your own pace. Like that might might be an option about you what but the advisor probably would know if there are courses like that. You know, because the other thing that I was thinking of is, if you do go into an impatient and then get out like you know in two months, then you're halfway through the Semester and then what like I don't know if you can join partway. and I don't know I mean an advisor might have to let you know that. More if you would stay at home. And you know if you would stay at home with your family and finish up the independent classes with the plan to rejoin for like summer term or something like that."
16059.0,Patient,yeah.
120.0,Provider,So it's kind of. You know it's a hard thing to know what to do with.
16059.0,Patient,mm hmm yeah for sure.
120.0,Provider,You know how long your winter break is.
16059.0,Patient,Two three weeks.
120.0,Provider,Okay.
16059.0,Patient,"yeah I think we go back to school on January 10 so depending on the last day of classes is Friday, this week, so if you didn't have finals it would be like works fine, but for me it's going to be three weeks."
120.0,Provider,"Okay. yeah i'll have to. January 10 is when you go back. Yes, right and then. The other thing we talked about was possibly having a joint call. With you me colleen your mom and Dr Anderson. About kind of like coming up with a plan because. You know colleen and I are both kind of of the the camp of you can do this. You know because I hate to kind of. You know, like given to the like, and not that it's giving into it, because it's not if you need to go there, you need to go there, you know, but I also. You know you're doing so much good work I hate to kind of interrupt that. yeah you know. And I hate to interrupt all of you know your your schooling and everything. But if we need to do that, you know we you know because we're going to kind of create like a contract that if you lose any more weight than you won't have a choice. You know that that's what's going to have to happen. But I also want you to be hundred percent honest. With me that if there's a part of you that's like. I really want to go to a higher level of care, then let's just do it. No let's not fart around. Because I knew, when I was in it, when I was in a situation I kind of wanted that because I was I kind of like the same reasons you kind of already said. You know it, it kind of proves that I do have a problem yeah. And, and it proves that you know it will kind of give you a break from. Everything else, because when you're a perfectionist and it life is hard because you're constantly stressed, you know. And when you go to treatment, you know you don't have to be worrying about school are. You shopping or. bills, or whatever."
16059.0,Patient,You just have to worry about eating.
120.0,Provider,And going to group or whatever it is.
16059.0,Patient,yeah it would be nice to just have like still focus on.
120.0,Provider,"yeah and I don't know which facilities, Dr Anderson looked at as far as the I don't know which ones are there, I mean I I love for you to you know you probably will have to go out of state, because there are a lot of programs in your area that I know of."
16059.0,Patient,yeah I don't think.
120.0,Provider,That there's like.
16059.0,Patient,recommending what we're gonna say.
120.0,Provider,I know what he recommends.
16059.0,Patient,You recommended ERC Chicago.
120.0,Provider,yeah Chicago there's ERC Denver. there's Center for discovery there's Castle would there's. there's a ton of them. But I don't know which ones are in your. Insurance and which ones have. Better are waiting lists.
16059.0,Patient,Then another one that. A family friend of ours. I think like to this place in Arizona was like metal.
120.0,Provider,The metal.
16059.0,Patient,house or something.
120.0,Provider,rosewood there's a there's a meadows there's wrote there yeah Arizona has. They yeah they have a pretty good facility down there do I people have gone there.
16059.0,Patient,There are some ever change.
120.0,Provider,"Which is where I live in orem I mean you talk. that's a really good place. You know there's there's different you know places, so you might have to like look on some websites and see what you think."
16059.0,Patient,yeah. definitely look into that.
120.0,Provider,"Okay um. So. So, going back to your your food choices, I know we talked last time about having more specific foods such as a kind bar or whatever, I mean I would prefer you have like a regular granola bar and on a kind of bar because again that feeds into the safe food kind of thing. i'd rather you have like a single serving packet of chips, you know that would be healthier for you right now be I mean, because I know it sounds weird because I got a healthy food healthy food, but for you, you need to be doing the opposite of healthy food, so to speak. You know. You need to be working on moderation. But so even even with food, like a kind of bar that's a relatively easy say food that's hard for you to actually eat."
16059.0,Patient,yeah I do like this.
120.0,Provider,Go ahead.
16059.0,Patient,I feel like there's not really like any food or I feel very comfortable eating like there's at least something that everything that I just can't quite feel comfortable it there's not really a true safe food as.
120.0,Provider,"Well, and and the reality is there won't be you know everything is going to be uncomfortable until it becomes comfortable. You know. And I and it's kind of like the thing that if you're waiting for it to become comfortable then you're not going to get better because it's not going to. become comfortable until you practice it. it's like saying I went on how to ride a bike but i'm not willing to try to write it. And the point oh yeah suddenly be able to. And, but I know you're scared of the feelings that come up when you do eat it because, like when you do eat something. I know colleen had said that your recovery record is very you know very shame based worried about what people thinking and what you know when the reality is nobody's thinking about anything about you, but I know that you think that."
16059.0,Patient,"yeah definitely very shame and guilt and anxiety ridden like those are like the three three main ones that I would say it is very much focused on. What other people think what other people might say, never happens, I mean it happens, but not not often."
120.0,Provider,"or your dad would say things but. You know, know that it, but you have to figure out how to. You know. Like acknowledge that, even if someone said something it doesn't matter. Like if they don't get they don't get to vote. And their their vote. doesn't count."
16059.0,Patient,or whatever yeah.
120.0,Provider,"i'm trying to think if there's any other. I don't know if there's any other facilities. In your area that because you know php is nice because you go, you know it's kind of not quite impatient but it's also more expensive, in the sense that you have to pay. An upfront apartment while you're there if you don't have one in your local area, you know impatient you live there and so it's included in the cost, you know with that, but some places, well, I don't know you'd have to look around, because some places might have like. A living area I think I think ERC and Denver has like an apartment complex part of their Program. But I don't know. I know that. Center for change here in utah they the people in the php program living in an apartment that's a few blocks away, and then they just pick them up everyday in a van. and bring them to the Center for programming, so I don't know. um. What do you think about that going back to me it was kind of beat this this dead horse for a bit about. Like higher level of care, but is that kind of what and like i'm trying to understand what you are wanting."
16059.0,Patient,"I wouldn't let you stay I love this group. near you and I would love to do stay with this i'm. kind of torn because more than I hear people mentioned him I could be I could see the health plan, I think there is a part of me that wants it like is no part. Because it's very inconvenient, at the same time, we can just. having to go to different states, and you know, like. yeah I just very, very term."
120.0,Provider,"yeah yeah. It is, it is, it is hard you know it's never going to be convenient, unfortunately, you know. Unless you went like. Over the summer or something like that, when are in a time when you're not in classes, but i'm wondering, you know your your advisor might also help you be able to. see if you I don't know how penn state works for summer classes, do they have summer classes, like a summer semester."
16059.0,Patient,You do.
120.0,Provider,"return or whatever it is, because I don't know your enrollment some some schools have enrollment or you're only enrolled for fall and winter, but. You know, you might be able to kind of assume that you're going to take winter off, and you know, to go to treatment and then resume. In summer or spring or whatever they whatever However, their setup yeah. So i'm going to write. They do."
16059.0,Patient,"mm hmm yeah like it's not like a like your enrollment is phone spring, but they have some are available for you to do."
120.0,Provider,"Okay, so are there three like semesters or trimesters I guess."
16059.0,Patient,um it's considered like two semesters and then they have summer courses available so it's like. They are short and.
120.0,Provider,yeah that's How was it.
16059.0,Patient,"Okay yeah the class a little bit longer and lane just said, I can fit everything in, but I think."
120.0,Provider,And do you know if you would have the option of enrolling for summer. Or do you have to a different kind of thing.
16059.0,Patient,"Now it's the same thing, I think, even just schedule classes. Okay, as is, I think. That you might have to do something like accept a contract for it but. Other than that."
120.0,Provider,"Because that's something that you could do I mean i'm brought down to have you talk to your advisor to about. What your options are as far as deferring. Or, as far as independent study classes, where you can do it on your own. On your own time. Because if you did go to a php Program. You would have time at night to do classes, if you wanted to, or you would have time on the weekends. And, and even if you're in residential you would still have some downtime you know, but you couldn't you know be like, I have to be in this class every Thursday at three or whatever you know."
16059.0,Patient,yeah. Okay.
120.0,Provider,"So, as far as assignments. How do you feel about writing that letter to your dad that you don't have to send it, but just to write it."
16059.0,Patient,feels weird like it almost feels kind of corny TV. I don't know how much like you know. I can like feel a little bit of anger towards him like I don't know how to express it really.
120.0,Provider,that's what. yeah that's what this forced to kind of Let it come out because you don't know what you don't know how to do it yet that's why we have to do it and figure it out.
16059.0,Patient,yeah I can I can try that.
120.0,Provider,You know because I want you to kind of keep writing and tap into the frustration. Because when you shared those things in group everybody else did.
16059.0,Patient,yeah.
120.0,Provider,"They were feeling it, you know. And so, and that's why that's kind of why I wanted you to do that in group was because I wanted you to kind of. Let them help you feel frustration towards it yeah. And then you're also going to talk to your advisor. And then I also want you to do an intake did you guys schedule that yet."
16059.0,Patient,"No, not yet."
120.0,Provider,"Do you know if you were going to do that, or if your mom was going to do that it was going to do that."
16059.0,Patient,"Dr anderson's that that a. Case manager could reach out to me. I go back into that. From from like the penn state. Okay, I could. correspond with whatever place and I go back to the office today for men check so."
120.0,Provider,"Okay. yeah. I think that would be good, because I do feel like we need to get moving on it, if we're you know if that's the direction you're going to go. I do feel like a push to get moving on it, because I feel like otherwise it's if you're if you're not fully like committed to i'm going to make this workout patient, you know, then. If that kind of back doors there and you're kind of kind of wanting it anyway, I think that it's going to be make it even harder to really continue working, you know, in an effective way at this level, you know. When do you leave campus to go home."
16059.0,Patient,next Saturday so.
120.0,Provider,OK OK i'm curious How far is the drive i'm assuming. How I want us to drive.

16059.0,Patient,horrible nightly.

120.0,Provider,"super weird. yeah yeah it was 50 something here yesterday, and it was like so beautiful so sunny and then it's supposed to be snow tonight, and then the high tomorrow is like 26 and the lowest like four or something i'm like what was going on."
16059.0,Patient,It was like 19 or something it was like.
120.0,Provider,"Another place. Yes, i'm. all over the place."

16059.0,Patient,yeah comes and gets me. To have a campus a car on campus. As a freshman.
120.0,Provider,"Oh OK, I assuming that you. Like What if you live in the park I guess you'd have to just walk is that just because 100 parking spaces."
16059.0,Patient,"They do, but it is kind of expensive to get the permits and then they run up kind of quickly in all good areas and then, if you don't get one fast enough. And you're like way put out further why that would even be to walk."
120.0,Provider,"Right, yes, it was going to be sense yeah."
16059.0,Patient,yeah but next year I signed a contract for an on campus apartment with three other friends and we get parking in the Latin there so. Nice i'll be know the slack so.
120.0,Provider,"yeah good. You know, because I know when you're you know, on campus it's kinda like that is your world pretty much, and so you don't really have to leave much. yeah, but it is nice to you know, to have cars to go on like weekend excursions."

And you have to re invent a new way of thinking. ya know so you have to kind of purposely.
