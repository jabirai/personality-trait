13105.0,Patient,And now right.
506.0,Provider,You know what I mean.
13105.0,Patient,it'd be like. Three strips just whole strips road. So then vetting thing.
506.0,Provider,"Okay, so, then you want so, then you want. You want three strips a day."
13105.0,Patient,"of eight millimeter. But you know my pharmacist said he's so he's so full he said. For you, if you'd like, if you want to send over the same prescription that i've been taking but then send over the three milligrams in case there's a problem I he'll fill just the two and a half. You know and."
506.0,Provider,"I think it should work with it should work with that three strips a day and you figure it out, it should work that's a standard dose. So then."
13105.0,Patient,We can work with that yeah.
506.0,Provider,"Okay, then I think it should go with that because. it's a standard dose but i'm just going to say i'm going to say, to make it easier on you're going to take one strip three times a day and we're going to call it, and you figure it out, you figure it out."
13105.0,Patient,yeah what I need. yeah yeah right.
506.0,Provider,Okay. Okay.
13105.0,Patient,Okay sounds good for now yeah that'll work.
506.0,Provider,"that's the highest dose that there is so you're on you're on the maximum dose a day of this. Okay you're you don't you don't get any higher than 24 milligrams a day. So you can figure out how to dose this like if it's one strip and then a half a strip or once or whatever you do whatever you do, you have 24 milligrams a day. And you, that is what you can figure out moving forward."
13105.0,Patient,yeah that sounds very good.
506.0,Provider,"Okay Sally I have i'm sending this in I have to run because, believe it or not, I have a group right now we have. A group. And it's the last group of the day."
