And I expected him to say hey Chicago has been badly I don't want to travel, but he actually communicated to me then he's got his mind you know go fully remodeled, in which case the black comes to refer to which I was very pleased to hear. So that's kind of where That said, if you remember, there was some conflict with his brother."

And I said that's very out of character for me to have that Raymond when you will be natural it's very tolerant, whoever like you have to understand i'm trying to do to your brother and. Anyway, we talked to Todd and he kind of expressed to me that you really wouldn't want to get in the way and he really doesn't include anything about sex just having a tough time. yeah you appreciate it and I felt like Okay, this is one less thing now. And most redeeming part about, that is, I know Asian continent. And I felt like you find kind of stood up. And kind of rose to the occasion like nobody wanted to be in that situation that he kind of finally made it happen. So that is really nice because I wasn't even sure he had it intense."
383.0,Provider,So you weren't you are glad that that G prompted him to do that. yeah okay. And how are you. In terms of what you were saying about just really feeling like you're not you've been not doing well how has that shown up for new in terms of just like your baseline mood or. What.

I feel really bad I go all over the place, I feel so agitated and when I have when i'm about 10 to seven days a week from appointments clearly. Not fun. And upon from, but I can now easily like. recognizes, I guess, they can my period I know Okay, this is what happened."
383.0,Provider,Let me.

383.0,Provider,mm hmm.
5970.0,Patient,"that's at least dangerous, though, but apart from that I just really feel like I can't. See, it is to say. Just feel like I need to sleep for a month. feel tired and I go anxious and. I feel anxious that odd times and if i'm not anxious about something many thrown it's it's because i'm beyond the point of caring and just like oh my gosh I can't even deal with this right now. I feel like you know, a healthy response to anything any. Excuse i'm i'd like very reactive, or like just not reactive at all, just an interested."
383.0,Provider,"Okay, so kind of do you feel sort of numb."
5970.0,Patient,"No, I don't I I react pretty intense to get things because this bill or things sometimes, though, like it's not like a noun which is i'm just like oh this I know my experience better and sometimes. And you know see like walk or. friends or something like that."
383.0,Provider,"Well, that doesn't sound, but you feel like that's problematic or is that just a function of kind of understanding life, a little bit better I."
5970.0,Patient,"Think, the second part is definitely understanding my little bit, the first part of being reactive and 30 inches or things I know I can't control. I feel, like, I would like to. react that way, because at the end of the day, other people in the stress all the time. I get my war there's this other manager who. I know it's a bit strange definitely toxic masculinity vibes from him."
383.0,Provider,What kind of vibes i'm sorry i'm not hearing.
5970.0,Patient,"Toxic masculinity. OK OK hates that i'm a manager and he just always used to say, well, what can you do this for me calls be like in the morning and says, can you do this by the octagon. It doesn't assign work to me and your colleagues, they have to have a ask nicely and get help of kind of relationship then tells me what to do so, push back. And when I push back like correctly because it's the right thing to do, he first wrote to my manager who smiles a colleague than human that didn't work he wrote my deputy director like and my deputy director is Mona was telling about, that is a bit of a difficult character. And he wrote me a like a fully written email saying this is bad feedback we should discuss this and then I talked to him and I will say this is maybe not aligned to this is guy me not mine. So he prompted me to kind of like go talk to him, which I did today. But I feel like been that kind of stuff happens I also feel extremely educated. But I feel like in hindsight, I shouldn't have been because."
383.0,Provider,well.
5970.0,Patient,"yeah it's just been a lot amanda like a be working crazy hours and doing some like. work outside of my program to support my Program. Which i'm happy to do but it's just been taking a toll, because now i'm dealing with a lot of work. You know, with my friend increasingly just it's almost like oh my God just another person's life is just. You know just taken from them. it's just been a lot really I just feel like it's been a lot, and maybe i'm doing my best, maybe i'm responding on that race just feels like not."
383.0,Provider,well. Do you want to share with me a little bit about your friend or during do you want to finish this pair talking about the situation with your boss.
5970.0,Patient,"Before finished talking about my boss. So I repeated directing can be a little. I don't know he's he's a strong personality and he likes like. she's a veteran so he likes might come at you, and he expects you to come back at 10 but that's not my personality. And when mean I don't do that he says to me it's me down and he says by lighting you're having trouble managing. And i'm thinking to myself, I shouldn't be having to work around your personality, you should be doing my job. But he's unapologetic in the way he behaves and. You know this is a person who I found out from another colleague, when this is going down that he treats a lot of people these things mean fine from doing different jobs before this, but this."
383.0,Provider,Is the deputy director.
5970.0,Patient,"So on like united airlines and one of the city and county of San Francisco. Both organizations, but soon, because of the way he talked to people. And in response, they asked him to resign so it's not me, you know, and I know i'm not being reactive anymore, because people i'd worked for being supportive, but it also looks like he doesn't mean any harm to me. it's just how he walks and i'm just adjusting to kind of working with someone of. That caliber. very professional backgrounds. And we can."
383.0,Provider,Be i'm sorry it's really hard to hear and i'm sure that it's hard for you to talk too loud because you're at work so.
5970.0,Patient,"yeah so it's just yeah it's just a different calibers personality. Experience on their side. it's it's kind of been like a whole lot of energy managing that. And I, and I almost wonder if I should Nice. job to do as well. So that's that's that's definitely been difficult. I don't quite. Have the time. Because if I do on demand support I don't get it, but apparently that's what I should be doing."
383.0,Provider,I see I see so they're kind of wanting you to step up and be more. assertive direct. Demanding kind of the way that they are. Okay. and Is that something you think you can deliver or you know you're willing to. Meaning that you're going to play by their rules and sense I guess.
5970.0,Patient,"i've decided that i'm going to find some middle ground. i've also started pushing back and be like well just because i'm asking you politely doesn't mean like this wiggle room. i'm not being kind of giving only given him more. audience the case various which I happen to get because of the nature of my job. So I kind of encouraged him to kind of take steps to. or just encouraged him in different ways by showing him that i'm loyal and you know not not trying to take this you know spark away just letting him shine because I feel like they're also they can be threatened by me, because they work with their superiors."
383.0,Provider,"Okay, and and who is the thing I speaking of now my boss."
5970.0,Patient,"adapt any direct yeah yeah so I work with some of the directors and i'm always now started looping in giving him an opportunity to speak and giving him some info beforehand to speak of. Although my work is not his wheelhouse so kind of paved the way for him to have a better sort of thing without feeling threatened by me. And on the other hand, I politely explained to him and even when he's being kind of. You know, in a way that I don't find professional just i'm not saying it's not i'm just saying it's not my style. I by the push back in the stone, or you know, in my own tone and just kind of disconnected things."
383.0,Provider,it's.
5970.0,Patient,Something i'm working on.
383.0,Provider,"yeah sounds like you, are maneuvering quite well, I mean that you're. He I mean you're. aware of how you want to be and you're following through with how you want to present."
5970.0,Patient,"yeah i'm not going to change my entire personality around someone here's the thing I mean this is the 21st century doing that isn't individually favorites. Too much of that and i'll have lost weight on my. So i'm trying to move very carefully when i'm just it it just takes a lot of energy out of me. I feel like it shouldn't be a part of my work at all. But i'm really terrible attitude towards it, because I feel like you know this this shouldn't be happening in the workplace in the standings but. I also understand that. Whoever that sits in that chair, because it's a facilities deputy director. know they come from a facilities background, so I will eventually have to deal with this kind of behavior anyway. So I might as well learn now. As."
383.0,Provider,"well. Is there anything else you want to speak on in relation to your work, or do you want to show up in about your friend or."
5970.0,Patient,"You know I don't mind moving on um. yeah so that was kind of phone do speak so don't get too someone I know from school but also she has been my one of my very close friends cuz it. So it connected into different ways. I would say this goes for my best friends growing up, not just growing up like. She was my best friend until like five years ago, until we kind of moved to different countries and couldn't really keep in touch as much anymore."
383.0,Provider,And where did where was she living.
5970.0,Patient,The girls who passed away.
383.0,Provider,mm hmm.
5970.0,Patient,She was any internal. Okay yeah so we went to school together.
383.0,Provider,And there were she was loving when she passed away or.
5970.0,Patient,"So it's kind of crazy she had gone to her. Final. pregnancy. And another character, temporary, but the training that that pregnant mothers go to. And she had contracted with that. And because pregnant women are more prone to respiratory illness, she just had a really hard telling them. Who says days and days of torture, because. Anyway, should say the ice for 10 days, she ended up delivering the baby on the eighth day. And the whole hope was lost the baby comes on she regained constrained. To baby was still on."
383.0,Provider,Ms.
5970.0,Patient,"And then at nine months I just kind of crazy I don't even think about how this is supposed to go, but I know it's not the what's happened at the end of the tone. And then, after she doing with the baby she passed out and she never came out of it."
383.0,Provider,"And she know that that they know that the baby had did not was not alive, you know, did they know that."
5970.0,Patient,I think she did.
383.0,Provider,A mom I mean your friend did.
5970.0,Patient,"I think she she kind of like lost consciousness after that. it's also very hard to talk to families about it, because my parents or their parents and. Informations like I don't know ask my parents much I just listen to what they see and don't quit them about it because it's very traumatizing for them. And the thing is, you know, no one can see her she's an icy bed alone isolated. Right spin couldn't see her her toddler couldn't see him not waiting. My goodness, you know so. Then, when she passed away it's awesome like my. Best friend's birthday that day. So right, you know we can plan this whole thing. it's just a lot to process from our you know. But I also feel like I don't get to say no, I get to say that, but also like a whole family's given her own parents are also."
383.0,Provider,Aware that they're.
5970.0,Patient,"they're all like not me because, although they're in the same country in the same city she died all alone."
383.0,Provider,Right right.

383.0,Provider,it's just.
5970.0,Patient,Such a trauma now she was 29.
383.0,Provider,My gosh.

383.0,Provider,Between the time that she got covert and the. went into the hospital was that but they're just a few days there you know between the time that you went to that doctor's appointment and then caught it and then with their.
5970.0,Patient,"She didn't quite realize she caught it for a long. She only realized, she was she had caught it when her like test was hurting because she didn't sound like fully traditional sentence. And what my dad had heard from her dad and his mom she realized she had courage he became really sensitive about going to the hospital."
383.0,Provider,She became very.
5970.0,Patient,"apprehensive like she didn't want to go to the hospital she didn't she didn't feel like they would. She thought they'd keep her bad drugs and how the baby and all that so. Also, about a little irritated because my friends there's a lot of victim blaming. Everyone talking work because she should have known this this business this i'm like. I know she didn't have the rational thing and get them, but she also be paid the ultimate price she lost her baby and her own life and, secondly, as women, we should all understand when we get happy we all use our minds, a little. So I don't I don't understand what it's like to be pregnant and how all those hormones and."
383.0,Provider,Fear and.
5970.0,Patient,"protective instincts that nature just. put on you, for no reason I just I can't imagine, I don't understand why anyone has the right to blame the victim."
383.0,Provider,Right right.
5970.0,Patient,But people have a baby oh.
383.0,Provider,"Well that's a very tragic situation, no doubt, I mean. for everyone that's a part of her life, you know, and then the rippling out."
5970.0,Patient,Oh yeah just. i'm also very fearful because it's covered is that large insurance. or their. Parents are both vaccinated but then i'm fascinated with the greatest parts and it's you know.
383.0,Provider,"seems like I mean. I remember talking to you when it was like it really wasn't a thing, and in Sri Lanka. yeah yeah. You know yeah."
5970.0,Patient,"My trip home. i'm supposed to go home in normal. I basically kind of given up the idea that i'm going on now, we just it just feels they can on my steam to do not know that I put myself at rest. If you like, give me roxanne internally been. fascinated by boxing I contrast and mean keeping safe. I have faith that i'll be okay, but at the same time I don't really have faith that I won't be a carrier or I will do the right thing in the middle of the global pandemic. To be around those people who else do it."
383.0,Provider,Right right. Now.
5970.0,Patient,like this right thing to do even museum to parents like two and a half years now.
383.0,Provider,Right right. I do do zoom calls or and facetime facetime or.
5970.0,Patient,"Skype facetime. it's also been less lately, because I just feel like I don't have any downtime. that's been a team."
383.0,Provider,"Well, how is your relationship with G, do you feel like that support, I mean supportive. resource in your life."
5970.0,Patient,"He said he's feeling water so it's like he looks at me to the best of his ability and you know he talks, through my day with me and tells me about his. Tracy tracy's level best to show up for me. I appreciate that."
383.0,Provider,But must feel good to have that.
5970.0,Patient,I think that's the only reason i'm like doing this well in this situation.
383.0,Provider,When did your friend passed away when did that occur.
5970.0,Patient,"is on the second of september's my friends, but."
383.0,Provider,I see. Well i'm sorry that's a. that's a tragedy what's this going to be their first child.
5970.0,Patient,"Second, show."
383.0,Provider,You mentioned okay.
5970.0,Patient,"yeah because. I feel you know I feel like since then to know i've been doing that. In terms of that. I just feel like there's so much going on a holiday, we have trying to recover one thing, so I can jump from one thing to another. And I will say the whole thing Idris brother, I think it just just threw me off quite a bit, and now that it's like. kind of sorted out, I think i'm kind of trying to. Trying to work through it, but I still feel a bit rattled."
383.0,Provider,uh huh.
5970.0,Patient,Which is interesting because it's been two months. But you know I just I just really want to get back to a normal place again.
383.0,Provider,And when when you Could you elaborate a little bit more on when you say that you know get back to a normal place what.
5970.0,Patient,"is going you're being on like. A more. sort of. I feel like i'm just want to kind of work through something on the other, that's challenging every week send something new. Whether it's was our country of some sort or loss so. It just feels like a lot and just I just don't like one week of my."
383.0,Provider,"Life like there's just it doesn't you know. I think that we can't count on that you know we can really only count on this particular moment and how we feel in it. You know how we feel in this moment and then how we feel in the next moment and how we're approaching the moments of our life because anything can happen, you know."
5970.0,Patient,that's true.
383.0,Provider,"So it seems like you, are striving to manage your moment as skillfully, as you can. I think that you know, having a new relationship or kind of going from not being in a relationship to being in a relationship is also. You know, changes the dynamic of your life, you know changes. can change a lot of things you know you, you have that person to touch base with and that creates less sort of time just by yourself, so sometimes we're we're actually a little bit not maybe as centered as we might be if we had more time. Without connecting or without you know socializing, so to speak. So it brings with it, you know wonderful things and then also challenges, other things too I think sometimes."
5970.0,Patient,I see.
383.0,Provider,"So. Do you feel like the medications that. you're taking in through bright heart health are helping you, I know that you know you went through that thing of. feeling like you weren't really attended to, well, and you know I didn't know even if you're going to stay with bright heart health after that, because that was not a good experience for you. and"
5970.0,Patient,"yeah it's just. I didn't want to leave write articles, mainly because you. Nutrition, but also, I don't really always have the best experience by shauntel I feel like. The medication themselves are good probably. Just feel like you know, a touch bases, with a once a month with. um she does some things that are concerning to me like. I say sorrows on the monthly."
383.0,Provider,"Sorry sorry it's so noisy out there, I just close my window again."
5970.0,Patient,My ssri Romney is filled not field it's prescribed once a month right and it's.
383.0,Provider,kind of.
5970.0,Patient,"A pain, because a that thing is not always in stock so when it's prescribed on monson one. You know. The pharmacy takes a few days to feeling because they have a back order moderate or whatever. Like on the fourth of July. For instance, the. pharmacy field it on that Sunday at. 4pm on. sunset five I couldn't make it then as a result, I was pathetic for today's. let's let's say that's okay I haven't brought it up before that I would like to retire he feels better um I don't know I just feel like to so many adult things like ever texted saying hey you were meant to feel this drug you have and. Then she asked me whole bunch of questions without just looking at my chart. I did trying to change my provider, so I asked them. You know the virtual clinic a holiday right, and they were like you have to talk to your provider to change your provider."
383.0,Provider,Right right.
5970.0,Patient,"And, of course, this appointment takes forever to share deal and by the time i'm done, I know i'm on medication and my concern is getting filled and I feel like that creates an atmosphere of feeling anxious about your medication, rather than knowing what to say. yeah. it's a good thing I don't really know what to do with that situation, because I know if I tried to change my provided will make it very difficult for me and I I. I texted shauntel saying hey can you refill this and she was like well, you should have an appointment and I said I had an appointment with you, two weeks ago. And then she asked me this whole question why like why aren't you in groups, and I say. To my chart. You know she could just read my chart before she speaks to me or you know. Just make some big festival things. And i've been having a difficult time, but the reason I haven't been able to change that is because it seems very difficult."
383.0,Provider,"Well, I am. I am not all up on how these the medication gets refilled and. If you notified her like a week in advance. With that solve the problem, or is that unrelated she needs to see monthly in order to refill is that the gist of it."
5970.0,Patient,"depends on what it makes sense, all right, I don't think any doctor ever has to see the patient monthly for that. But she kind of makes the point of doing that i'm not really asked her why. Add puts me in a very uncomfortable position it's just an ssri it's not a controlled substance. And she prescribes it and it's a it's in both of our best interest for me to take it every day without within doses. You know that's really uncomfortable with everything else, I understand that she has to see me honestly."
383.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
5970.0,Patient,"Well, I do when I whenever I do notify her own tax she just doesn't read my chart and then she goes I call you up to see me. Like I did see you, it is just too early to refill then it's you know I shouldn't have to tell someone that it's their job."
383.0,Provider,"Right right right. Well, I can put in. You know I can put in the inquiry that you would still like to change providers. It is. I just it's tricky because i'm out of that power domain, you know, in terms of the medication providers I don't. I mean, I can put the request in that she will see a shoot. If you still want that I can still throw it out there into the and see if that can be accommodated for you. Now that other purposes chantelle has agreed that you don't need to attend groups at some point along the road she agreed to that. Because most people do it's actually like super rare that they allow someone to to not attend group. And i'm i'm kind of don't want to rock that boat, because if that boat gets rocked you might it might be like you know you need to attend groups."
5970.0,Patient,"What even own groups, I have no one's ever explained this to remind you. Is a group therapy."
383.0,Provider,"it's group therapy it's kind of more it's also it's actually more psycho educational and a touch base with the with the medication provider, whoever that is so. Meaning some people will. I mean if you were in a group would be your medication provider, that is, you know assigned to that group, along with a therapist. Oh that's worse. yeah so the therapist does a section, you know section in a psycho educational section. And every therapist kind of does it differently and and then the medication providers do their thing me, but their thing is checking in with every patient to see do you need refills how are you doing. With your refills or you know if you need to make an individual appointment with the medication provider, for whatever reason, so that's why the medication providers like it, because they get to see everybody once a week. And it's really is good for. keeping up on refills and that's where the I think the whole is with you because you're not an NGO. room, so the medication provider is not seeing you to check up on Where are you, with your refill needs and so forth. Some people find the groups are you know so it's it's a it's a medley of people, you know it's that's the best way I can put it, you know you. could have the kind of job you have, and then there could be somebody that has like a chronic illness and has been in bed for a year, you know there's there's there's a there's a lot of different kinds of people in these groups."
5970.0,Patient,"This is number, all you need to get oh no. yeah no comfortable with that."
383.0,Provider,"yeah you're you're on the camera you're all you're seeing the other people and they're seeing you. And it's confidential that you just have your first name last initial and there's that measure to maintain confidentiality, but. You know, we have group discussions everybody kind of I might present something and then people discuss in relation to that topic whatever thoughts, you know. They have about it, so can be interesting for learning different things about mental health. it's a more of a psycho educational approach with discussion."
5970.0,Patient,"That does sound good, but the privacy reasons, with other people present I don't feel comfortable doing, especially with how unique my name is."
383.0,Provider,You do have a very lovely unique name.
5970.0,Patient,"And you'd be surprised. Like knowing what I know about technology I don't feel comfortable. I don't believe anything is private and confidential, even if you're on a computer on private line and can always pull up my phone and record this."
383.0,Provider,that's the thing that's really. kind of daunting these days.
5970.0,Patient,"yeah I mean the kind of job, I have to kind of profile i'm building, they can afford that."
383.0,Provider,"Well, so then we're kind of back to the. The thing of if you put a request in for a different provider. They really want you to be there in group."
5970.0,Patient,"mean. it's you know I don't really I just wish shonda would be on top of things. I feel like at the end of the day, yeah okay group makes it easier for her, but you know, like I do make monthly appointment, you know that's that's whatever amount of money that's paid to. My appointments, I never and i'm along the very short. So it's just really I wish she'd be on top of things, so I can trust her. yeah but instead i'm get stuck with situations like Labor day weekend writer. prescription couldn't be filled and then couldn't pick it up because of mcs are closed. And this is just an ssri, this is not control drop."
383.0,Provider,"Right right well, maybe like a week when you looks like you only have like a weeks left worth or two weeks. Even two weeks left worth and maybe. You start making that contact, so you can get that refill in."
5970.0,Patient,i'll try that i'm seeing her own in. Another 10 days. yeah and that will be just in time to feel the prescriptions that smell So hopefully she'll be more responsive to stone.
383.0,Provider,"yeah. I mean, maybe you might even want to give her a heads up before your appointment if it's going to be that close because I see your appointment is on the 30th. Her. and So what do you want to do in terms of individual do you want to get back on the bi monthly regular appointments."
5970.0,Patient,That sounds good.
383.0,Provider,"All right, so let's go ahead and just get that lift in terms of."

5970.0,Patient,"But I go. To the gym I train me to train and then. Each song I love it don't get me wrong, I really like socializing I think i'm just still adjusting."
383.0,Provider,"yeah well, we can just schedule an appointment like once every three weeks, and maybe that would be easier for you to manage because the thing about scheduling and canceling is it. It becomes complicated, for you know, I have to cancel this and then, if it's not cancelled, you get charged and then it leaves the spot available for people and and so then that's you know."
5970.0,Patient,Just I understand it's it's cheap everyone involved. So do you have any availability on the. Eighth of October.
383.0,Provider,yeah so um. What would be great as if we could get on something regular. You know I mean do you feel like you would even if it was once a month that you would want like an appointment on like the first week of the month. On for on a Friday that that would be the best for you or with your traveling that might be with on a Friday i'm just don't know if that's without a day that.
5970.0,Patient,"So what's happening is you know, we have every second Friday deals. Okay, but some of those Fridays i'm traveling but I know for a fact that on the eighth i'm not. Okay, and that works for me. Subsequently, I think. I should do a knowing like knowing what weekends, I have off. Okay, because i'd much rather talk from home."
