741.0,Provider,"I saw opioid. replacement okay. Okay you're gonna have to do a urine drug screen for us it's like frequently past do, which means you're gonna have to go to a lab. So just pick the lab this closest and most convenient for you to do it with. And then tell the virtual clinic. And then they can send the orders over and get it done so that we don't have any more, so we don't have any issues you got to surveys that are due and that's it."
15798.0,Patient,yeah.
741.0,Provider,So.
15798.0,Patient,I just know okay okay.
741.0,Provider,I just want to keep everything up.
15798.0,Patient,yeah.
741.0,Provider,So that they don't get their know their nose out of joint you know.
15798.0,Patient,"Right yeah I haven't heard anything about the urine test, I was wondering about that."
741.0,Provider,"Oh yeah cuz the last one they sent the last one and. And it says it was delivered so that's a tracking stated that it was delivered, but it was never done."
15798.0,Patient,Okay.
741.0,Provider,"So, since it's been so long they're gonna make you go to a lab."
15798.0,Patient,Okay.
741.0,Provider,And then.
15798.0,Patient,"what's like the normal rule on that because I feel like I like miss like an orientation or something, because I feel like I miss."
741.0,Provider,"Okay well. And you know how this plays runs is like we're always um. Things are always changing right. yeah because it's online technology and it's actually kind of a new system and, and I would think so anyway and. That we've changed it now, so that the. Surveys are going to come out on the first and the 15th. Okay, and and then the drug screens come, you have to do the first one, and the lab which I think you already did so they mailed you want. And as long as you get one, you need to make sure that you get one every month, if you haven't gotten it by the middle of the next month call them and tell them you you read your drug screen. Okay, when the package comes in the mail you'll know what it is, because it comes from bright heart."
15798.0,Patient,"yeah I mean I. thought it, but I just never like."
741.0,Provider,You didn't know what to do with it.
15798.0,Patient,yeah they never told me what to do with it and then like normally and group so let people know if they to do there's. My and I never heard anything.
741.0,Provider,Okay yeah.
15798.0,Patient,yeah I mean.
741.0,Provider,"So, so when you get it don't wait for anybody to tell you how that virtual clinic down take you they'll send you to the right people telling me that your urine drug screen and you need to do it don't open it. just keep the package and tasks Okay, and then they'll tell you they'll put you in touch with the right people that you need to be. A nurse, I think, monitors it and you open it and they give you the instructions, step by step. Okay okay and but. Yes, now they're doing a more of an orientation and letting people know and we're trying well, and let me put it this way. I, as in my groups I am trying to make sure that people understand how it works and what they're supposed to do so, you know I can't speak for everybody else, but I know as what i'm trying to do, because I understand how confusing it can be. and yeah they just changed it they had those silly. Surveys coming out every single week, but now they they switched it to where they come out around the first and the 15th."
15798.0,Patient,"Okay, because I just. was told like I just go back to the first email I got with the surveys and fill them out, I really casually."
741.0,Provider,that's fine that's fine and you just need.
15798.0,Patient,That but i've not gotten any other emails with new ones ever.
741.0,Provider,"I believe you they don't always um things have gotten past they've actually had to hire some more care navigators and they're in training, right now, so i'm sure there's gonna be a bunch of mess up along the way isn't the learning curve right. So it happens and and yeah they don't always get every I mean I don't know I wouldn't want to be a care navigator personally. Because they have way too much stuff to do."
15798.0,Patient,"I believe it yeah we yeah i've been filling out just the initial. ones yeah. When I got in the first email and that's appears to have been working for me, I know I didn't fill out the last two weeks because I canceled my group appointment last week. Because I was on vacation. Right and then this week, our group got canceled so, then I just didn't thing to do it, I guess."
741.0,Provider,that's all right um. yeah it was canceled by your provider oh yeah that's perfect and actually both cancelled it for some reason.
15798.0,Patient,yeah I don't know.
741.0,Provider,I don't either. And then yeah you canceled the other one and you cancel the peer support. The wire a peer support. On the 30th. Oh no don't ask me.
15798.0,Patient,A peer support.
741.0,Provider,"yeah some kind of report appointment. But I don't know it was clinical communication assessment, I don't know monique is out sick today."
15798.0,Patient,"No, I did not kids a lot."
741.0,Provider,"No, they did."
15798.0,Patient,yeah okay.
741.0,Provider,"yeah my apparently somebody else did. cause monique was out sick whoever, that is, I don't know who that person is so."
15798.0,Patient,I think that's what they said yeah.
741.0,Provider,yeah and and then you been yeah I know you've been attending you just haven't attended. supposed to get to appointments with me. And we didn't see each other in December at all.
15798.0,Patient,Yes.
741.0,Provider,"Because I. Because of whatever we I don't remember why but, on the third I didn't I handled."
15798.0,Patient,"Yes, and then. I just hide."
741.0,Provider,"And you just find available, and then the last week of December I wasn't available anyway so."
15798.0,Patient,So I would have probably.
741.0,Provider,"yeah I was. I was really, really sick that last week so."
15798.0,Patient,i'm sorry to hear that.
741.0,Provider,yeah me to. get over it.
15798.0,Patient,yeah.
741.0,Provider,"And alright so that's fine, but we need to make sure that we make appointment or."
15798.0,Patient,I have another one with you this month as well.
741.0,Provider,"Okay, good. Already, yes, you do awesome so that one's already made so we're in good shape there because you'll just take care of the urine drug screen. yeah and the. Surveys you don't have any surveys overdue we just have three that are do. Physical. A physical health, the BAM and the pH Q."
15798.0,Patient,Okay.
741.0,Provider,"So um. And then. So. What kind of things, would you like to work on with me."
15798.0,Patient,"Do I have to do that safety plans, Joe."
741.0,Provider,And if we already know we already created the safety plan. It looks like. When I went to check. You said that we already did it and I looked at it.
15798.0,Patient,I don't think we did do it.
741.0,Provider,"Oh no, we did not."
15798.0,Patient,A lot you're going to do it next time we met.
741.0,Provider,"yeah Okay, we need to do that real fast. will get that done. Alright, so. I need you to think about the thoughts images moods situations behavior. That act as a warning signs that a crisis may be developing and I need three different warning signs. So, like if what what is it when you get. And what do you think about. How do you feel. And what is it that you're telling yourself, when you become so suicidal and hopeless."
15798.0,Patient,"I mostly just feel like they're intrusive thoughts. Related to like my anxiety like it's not really something i'm like ruminating on is the like. Because I know I got flagged for this, but like i'm not suicidal I mean."
741.0,Provider,Right right.
15798.0,Patient,"intrusive thoughts that are like i'm going to kill myself and it's just like POPs into my head, but I would never actually consider it if that makes sense, like."
741.0,Provider,are high.
15798.0,Patient,So I know why I got flag. But I also i'm like. I view them as intrusive thoughts like I don't view them as something that is serious.
741.0,Provider,"Okay. and I put that down intrusive thoughts that's killing so it's basically. Like a mini one part one. But what create, why does that pot thought pop in your head. Frustration is it out of hopelessness."
15798.0,Patient,Okay okay.
741.0,Provider,"Where does that. same. So shame is a big one. Okay, any gear button there and."
15798.0,Patient,um yeah I feel like they're pretty similar i'm just like when I think about like.
741.0,Provider,"Well, there are two different things. So we can talk about the difference between the two. yeah. And Okay, so one other. warning sign um. Is it your anxiety or depression. or."
15798.0,Patient,anxiety. I feel like my depression is due to anxiety if i'm experiencing a depression it's because i'm so anxious usually.
741.0,Provider,"Okay, and what kind of what kind of what is it that you're afraid of."
15798.0,Patient,"i'm. kind of puzzled the day. And recently it's. I get really anxious about. kind of like getting stuck in these patterns, where like someone dies because i've had a lot of death in my family and like just feeling like it's going to keep happening forever and i'm going to be in survival mode forever and it just feels kind of shitty."
741.0,Provider,anxiety regarding loss. yeah okay.
15798.0,Patient,"And being worried it's going to like. Keep. It will never allowed in life, and like not be moving forward with life like."
741.0,Provider,"Okay, and okay."
15798.0,Patient,Being a failure.
741.0,Provider,"And you could be a stumbling block. Okay. All right. So all that kind of that kind of helps because those are some things that we can talk about shame and guilt and what the differences. and And that might help you a little bit. And then we can work through some of that. Shame stuff that you feel. Okay Okay, and the other thing as we talk about grief and loss. Because. The reality is that grief and loss are a part of life."
15798.0,Patient,hmm.
741.0,Provider,"It is actually a part of the cycle of life. And we're going to experience that loss over and over again throughout our lives we just are because we're gonna lose people. yeah we also lose other things. Like. jobs. And friends and boyfriends. huh i'm pet. Because i've had stopped last as long as we do. And there's a lot of different things, you can lose. And then it will affect you. In the same way. And it will some of it is there some of the loss that we experience is very devastating I had to write a goodbye letter to my drug of choice. Because, yes, it was not healthy, but it was something that I did for years and years and years and in for a long time, it was my best friend. Because it helped me cope. yeah but to to stop doing it is a loss. So there's a grieving process, even when you stop using drugs, which, just like really sounds really ridiculous to me but Daddy is what happened."
15798.0,Patient,yeah make sense.
741.0,Provider,"Alright, so do those two items kind of. That that and building the support system. Because it looks like it looks like right here, you and I mentioned something about building a support system, which we all need to do. Because. We are not islands, we must live in community. He and if I was good at everything that I would be superwoman but i'm not."
15798.0,Patient,here.
741.0,Provider,So some internal coping strategies things that you can do to take your mind off your problems and talking about these these warning signs. And they can take your mind off your problems without contacting another person So what are some of the things that you do to distract yourself from the intrusive thoughts or getting bogged down in the shame and guilt or the anxiety that you feel. From loss and it becoming an issue every time you lose somebody. What are some of the things like do you do any direct relaxation technique or meditation.
15798.0,Patient,"i'm if i'm really anxious about something I will do grounding. Okay, I also. Try to like recognize the anxious thought potter and that i'm doing like. Okay i'm saying, or something like that or black and white thinking it's a popular one for me."
741.0,Provider,yeah.
15798.0,Patient,"I don't know, I find that pretty useful, because then at least I know what i'm doing."
741.0,Provider,Right right. yeah.
15798.0,Patient,"And then. Usually like i'm. Like just like watch TV or listen to music or like get up and do something else, like do something. or like right like."
741.0,Provider,Like working out.
15798.0,Patient,Like distract myself.
741.0,Provider,Basically okay.
15798.0,Patient,Are we to bug.
741.0,Provider,"Like I said I can't spell. Okay, and then i'm. Just. So with activity. yeah. All right. So what about um social settings and people that profile that distraction. Well, you, you said something about going to say something about the park. Are for a run well worth it."
15798.0,Patient,Though I know I usually like when I work out I usually do like a class on the peloton.
741.0,Provider,"Okay, so you don't really go anywhere."
15798.0,Patient,So yeah.
741.0,Provider,Especially right now yeah. and
15798.0,Patient,I mean what's a good distraction for sure.
741.0,Provider,Okay work.
15798.0,Patient,I work with kids so they're pretty funny.
741.0,Provider,yeah and you have to be totally present to really be able to experience them.

Like to do this, and I have not done it in very long time, because it has not been bad enough, but like i'll take i've gamma penton for acute anxiety and I usually makes me go to sleep. Just because, like if i'm having like a panic attack like a full blown panic attack, then I like it's really hard for me to talk because i'm trying to breathe."

741.0,Provider,"I mean I communicate via email but it's kind of hard to get a sense of personality and stuff through the email, so I was just kind of curious what's he, like all right well and. What i'd like to do is send you some information on grief and loss. it's gonna it's an email. Okay, and it's going to look like a lot, but it was because the grief information packet I had to do it one page at a time. It looks like a whole bunch but it's not okay. Okay, and so I think that's what I want to start with, is working on that, but just because you're dealing with a fresh. Fresh loss in your life. yeah that that is impacting you right now, so I figured that this would be a good time to do that."
15798.0,Patient,I agree.

15798.0,Patient,"Right that's what I certainly did but it's good to it's always good to talk about it and because I don't like talking about vulnerability with my close friends, I prefer to do it with professionals so. Why would I want if they ask, but like. I would never like bring it up, because I just feel like at this point, it just sounds so ridiculous and like i'm like so pitiful, though."

15798.0,Patient,"that's crazy. To me, I think it's just like my age to you know. mm hmm not a ton of people my age have."

741.0,Provider,"wow okay. It also like okay my parents were older when I was born. My mom was 35 when I was born. And so my mom was 35 my dad was 37 when my brother was already 13. yeah so here is this little bitty baby, so I have a whole different experience. Then, on top of that my grandfather was the oldest of eight kids. He, so in that whole span. That the variation in age from my grandfather to just to give you an idea my dad's uncle was like three or four months younger than him. wow because of my grandfather youngest brother was like younger than my dad's."
