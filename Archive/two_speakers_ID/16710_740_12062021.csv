740.0,Provider,"Okay, thank. You so much. Nice to meet you."
16710.0,Patient,It seems like it's been everyone's goal this year to like see how much they can Fuck with me and make me think i'm crazy.
740.0,Provider,i'm.
16710.0,Patient,"i'm just so tired. Of this. Like I. I just realized. He is in the symphony. fucking kill. i'm just fed up with everybody and like i'm so fat being poked and prodded and everyone's just like fucking with me and not being straight it's so crazy. it's like this crazy should i've ever heard of. This guy in the symphony. He plays trombone too, but I just it's something I realized five days ago, like when I listen to spotify spotify isn't social media it's just like you listen to music it's not. like Facebook like who's. Using spotify as social media, but I realized this guy spent the entire year like on spotify thinking, I was talking to him. When really I would just like hear a song or think of a song and like add it to my playlist for the month like minding my own business, and he was we were apart the whole time for a year, and he thought it was like a dialogue. and It wasn't until like recently. And like we both love each other but that's just so crazy to realize that that happened like that, and he got his ex involved to like. You know, help assure me that I wasn't getting me today. For from his perspective, like I just lived my life being me today in this industry that's a big reason I had a breakdown and I need this help and he was kind of like a last straw because he's like so powerful and I do like love him like we love each other it's just like. When you hear you have bipolar and that you'll struggle with delusions or struggle with like feeling like you're in love with people. And like that's such a mind Fuck like. I just like why wouldn't you just send me an email like that's such a mind Fuck. And then he got his ex involved, you know, and then in there, making it this whole like and I do want to create music that's what I want to do in life, you know. Like that's what i'm here to do, but they make because they're these like California big artists. And they're part of this like oakland art community and they made it this whole like spiritual thing of like we're watching this artists like come into their own because, if I just haven't have any sort of mood like. of any kind or right or hear a song I like I just put it on a playlist. So i'm really good at like if i'm in a mood like I can think of, like a dozen songs that fit that mood. Because I just like listen to music all the time because i'm a musician that's not. But I just realized like for six months, all of these eyes have been on me like a spectacle of like me figuring out my shit with neck, and then the X being involved in like now like I posted something on my story to see it randomly and now like. Like 30 verified musician accounts are like watching me now because they think i'm like the next like billy eilish but that's just so fucking insane that it's like sure I had like. Like. A guy in the Cynthia and I fell in love cool, but now it's like everyone had their eyes on me the whole time. that's so weird in the X was like so involved. Like that's super fucking it just is so crazy. That it almost made me freak out because i'm like what the Fuck why. Is everyone fucking with me, you know."
740.0,Provider,So I want to make sure I get it right so with the spotify account. Other people can see your account. yeah the people can watch you.
16710.0,Patient,yeah. But like who the Fuck watches spotify. Except for him.
740.0,Provider,To 30 their music.
16710.0,Patient,yeah because it's i'm just. Like a girl in college like I hear a song and i'm like cool like what the Fuck.
740.0,Provider,But maybe they just like your playlist.
16710.0,Patient,They do and I guess it's like spectacle it's like super fucking interesting the drama of like a college girl pushing away a symphony musician like I can understand that entertainment from like a musician point of view.
740.0,Provider,So you know when the guy was together.
16710.0,Patient,"Well, I realized he spent a year of his life saying I love you and I did say I love you, but I need like that was maybe a week ago. And i'm like leave me alone, like everybody leave me alone. Like i'm generally pretty patient, but they everybody is pissing me off because, like what the Fuck that's the most crazy shit i've ever heard and if i'm actively battling to like not feel crazy it's like everyone is just trying to. freak me out."
740.0,Provider,i'm having holes here but i'm learning how to put this all together so there's a guy. That you were talking to him the same funny. yeah okay. yeah i've been talking for a year.
16710.0,Patient,"He used to be. I got to San Francisco he was a teacher figure that's why. i'm away because I was 18 he was 24. When we started being in each other's lives and we got really close, but like neither of us were crossing any lines. So from about. On we've been in each other's lives. Okay um. And now he's like 29 ish 28 ish and i'm like about to be 23. But we obviously broke apart during the pandemic. uh huh did we both dated other people. Like totally not thinking about it. Like why Would I be but he did like love me but I didn't know that I didn't know that he liked loved me the whole time and he, like. she's so fucked up like."
740.0,Provider,"Come on, keep on with the story come up."
16710.0,Patient,"Here broke up with his X because, like it wasn't me. In a way, that's like. yeah like he thinks i'm the one."
740.0,Provider,"Okay, and."
16710.0,Patient,"Any sure about it, and I think the one that i'm just like."
740.0,Provider,"The word of the conflict, what is it it's disturbing you feel bad."
16710.0,Patient,Because I just like i'm ready to feel normal and not feel fucked with like that was so confusing and draining.
740.0,Provider,How was it confusing.
16710.0,Patient,"Because I didn't know that he was sending me messages on spotify I thought he just wasn't speaking to me, I was just minding my own business."
740.0,Provider,So I mean I don't really know how spotify work so that's ongoing learning from you today.
16710.0,Patient,i'm not a social media.
740.0,Provider,"it's like why. When he says, I have to send an email, I can send messages on."
16710.0,Patient,"It wasn't messages, it was it was a message in song form."
740.0,Provider,"Oh, my."
16710.0,Patient,"My like he wrote, which is just like really cute but i'm like what the Fuck is going on."
740.0,Provider,What do you mean well.
16710.0,Patient,i'm just like I don't know.
740.0,Provider,"Anything shady let me, let me help you out apparently the main isn't over you apparently they still love you apparently he still wants you. Apparently the girl that he got into in the pandemic were just the fall back, but, of course, at the end of the day, she couldn't be true because he still wants you. So that's where his heart is and so he knows that you hang out on spotify since he knows you have a major account on spotify, then what he did to get your attention was the thing you love miss just through song that's. Not messing with you that's just let it they're just going over the top, to let you know that he's still love you that out any. So keep things in perspective, I know you haven't been on your medication, so I know it's kind of like lift but. You got to keep things in perspective I don't care if there's the way you were talking you acted like alien some more shauna contents your different benefit amphetamine unlike but what it is, is perspective, you I mean you just fell in love with a guy and he fell in love with you and."
16710.0,Patient,"i'm just like. I think i've just been struggling with this for months and i'm ready to have a routine and feel normal like I was just feeling good and then it like sunken like I didn't even think about I had only looked at like. I didn't look at the whole year I just realized it's been a whole year. it's been since last. Like December, but I thought it was just like. The last. couple I thought it was just the last month."
740.0,Provider,But how did you identify that it was the whole year.
16710.0,Patient,Because I looked.
740.0,Provider,Then you went you went to look back on here.
16710.0,Patient,"Like I was minding my business, I was talking to him, I was just minding my business."
740.0,Provider,So let me exit is how you know the follow up.
16710.0,Patient,"Because I looked back at them and I like put them side by side. In every single day has been a reply. Or the last or every few days has been like a reply. To this I listened to. And he kept. texting me and he kept texting me during and I was like Why would he leave me alone like we don't live in the same place. Because i'm such a bench. Well, I don't say like that."
740.0,Provider,"Well, basically, he was just trying to get your attention."
16710.0,Patient,yeah and he kept texting me and I. didn't understand. I didn't understand that.
740.0,Provider,My thoughts. you're irritated because of the safety defending him just coming out and being and being. open and no i'm just i'm just ready to like.
16710.0,Patient,feel where reality is.
740.0,Provider,What do you mean in that What do you mean.
16710.0,Patient,I will I just figured that out and i'm.
740.0,Provider,All because you missed it in as a year later.
16710.0,Patient,"No it's I just figured all of this shit out. And i'm like ready to like feel normal, because when I. Would meant when I would say this to like a roommate or my dad and they're like, how do you know how do you want to like kill people because you're like stop like i'm so exhausted of this like constant. Because i've been battling that because that sounds. crazy to to interpret it like that, like that is such a crazy thing to think you know because I wasn't looking at the whole year i'm just so exhausted of."
740.0,Provider,"Like oh i'm so done. Your brain is scattered. yeah let's put things in perspective. Right so first we understand you haven't been on your made I haven't seen you know before. You drop off the face of the earth, because I feel like if I would have told you this, or if I would have told anyone, while I was figuring it out."
16710.0,Patient,They would just be like no now you sound crazy.
740.0,Provider,I don't have to be a sound crazy.
16710.0,Patient,"I know, but everybody else in my life did. I know i'm. What do I even think about this."
740.0,Provider,What do you think about it.
16710.0,Patient,I know that I love him it's.
740.0,Provider,Just like.
16710.0,Patient,"Oh, my God has X cotton ball."
740.0,Provider,What is X do let's talk about the eighth what she's.
16710.0,Patient,"been she's been creating i'm on spotify I just realized since summer. she's been creating me for me like supportive playlists. Because I think she could tell that because Nick nick's therapist was probably like well she saw that you dated this 30 year old artist. You know, and that didn't end she knows you broke up with her so she's probably like doesn't want to date, you because of that i'm sure he, like talk to her. I know that he did. I think it was flattering that it's because it's true it's like Why would I roll the dice on this guy who makes like six figures he's in the symphony like I don't know his character. He has like exhibited a lot of frat boy like toxic masculinity previously like Why would I I don't want to be someone side piece, and I saw that like. This woman that i'm like whoa like that's who I want to be when I grow up like he dumped her like Why would I roll the dice on that was was my original stance. is like from a 22 year old who's a nanny and like doing music on the side it's like not to make this a class thing but it's just like you like there's validity and looking at people's dating history, so I didn't understand when she all."
740.0,Provider,"The heart wants what he wants. I know doesn't matter if it's six figures or if if. If if if a Commission based job they get paid, and that would mean, I mean the heart wants what he wants. yeah money, I mean money is Co. But it's not everything. I know i'm saying, and so I mean the thing about it is the only thing you can do is be clarity. Right, so the best thing you can possibly do is to reach out to him. yeah."
16710.0,Patient,I will like once I feel settled.
740.0,Provider,When I.
16710.0,Patient,I don't think i've felt settled. Because I didn't I didn't know that that's what happened and and I don't think I felt settled. Since the pandemic started.
740.0,Provider,mm hmm. You know me mentally settled.
16710.0,Patient,yeah mentally settled and grounded in my body. And like I think i've just been like coping. and pushing through. And like not.
740.0,Provider,Only was he happy.
16710.0,Patient,I know I will it's just like and that's why it's like I cannot talk to anybody until I. You know verify.

740.0,Provider,drive yourself nuts.
16710.0,Patient,I know I verified it and I just like have been in a coma of like what the Fuck for the past five days and now i'm finally like coming out of my skin. Because it's like every it feels like everybody wants something from you and you just are so confused.
740.0,Provider,Or what do they want.
16710.0,Patient,I don't know I i'm just like i'm really independent.
740.0,Provider,"For this is what you have to do. Right, so that you have to have evidence I was talking with them about Paula group, this morning, oh yeah my mom Oliver."
16710.0,Patient,"I will be back. Soon, I know I am i'm just like."
740.0,Provider,"i'm so confused, I was saying this about bipolar group this morning. yeah we actually showed a video of how to actually practice. Really. Right so yeah you would you would have learned a whole lot if you as a group, but. My thing is this and I told him a lot of times we shape our live. off of an assumption. And misinterpreting what what you what you what you think you know, or what you think you see without proper evidence does that make sense. and end of the day, you have to be able to. prove this to be true if you cannot prove it to be true, then nine times out of 10 is just joy is just show if you plant your mind playing tricks on me. magic air there has to be evidence right saying, where, will you go to court, but plenty of people have gone that route because it wasn't enough evidence to support the challenge. In the same vein, and this kind of situation man, and you know i'm saying and, at the end of the day, i'm gonna tell you Okay, you need consistency you're not consistent do you have to be consistent, you have to be consistent in this program. You just know your medication like you can't you know i'm saying the crazy part about it is, is that you, you can try to figure this out on your own if that's the case, but what you need us for."
16710.0,Patient,I know I can't i'm just like. everybody's driving me crazy.
740.0,Provider,I believe your jacket when data possible and a lot of like oh.

16710.0,Patient,"Good in like I just want. to wake up and have coffee in feeling the President, again I feel like I just went through a war. And I guess I did like I went through a pandemic and then this whole confusing situation with an egg."
740.0,Provider,"So. Basically it just i'ma tell you what it really sounds like. What it sounds like to me it just sounds like that you're grieving because of the fact that you missed that. You miss the cues and you weren't aware if allow has been a whole year, and many things that have happened since being but I didn't see it I didn't see the side I missed the cues. I missed it all, you know said I was you know, I was somewhere else you know wasn't looking at wasn't looking into it, and then I missed the Info now what would what could have been something. We will never know."

This is what people what people love you that's just what they do I literally I had in my. head and loose bands and St Lucia. And all that kind of stuff and i've had around."
16710.0,Patient,tax free. yeah.
740.0,Provider,"yeah I mean no that's the message that they were just go out there, I didn't know yeah with to get out of this stuff."

740.0,Provider,What will you say to wake up and being the President i'm trying to understand what they mean I guess i'm i'm i'm not a baby.
16710.0,Patient,"Just because real overnight. I realized that and I said I love you back. In kind of because I know what his you know, like situation and I know like his dad and, like the Faculty and everything like he wouldn't go through all of this, unless like he thought, this is it."
740.0,Provider,mm hmm.

740.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16710.0,Patient,And that's a crazy thing to realize overnight.
740.0,Provider,well. I mean yeah so it just sounds like your mind is just completely blown. Because yeah sometimes we see these little stories on TV.
16710.0,Patient,yeah.
740.0,Provider,"And then we see leftovers on the movies, and so like they but we didn't we would never imagined it would turn out but it's like a fluke like this."
16710.0,Patient,yeah.
740.0,Provider,"So yeah I mean of course you can always jump negatively by somebody with my emotion. or see. But see that's the thing you gotta be careful. You i'm saying, because of your past history and things like that you know same with someone has finally came to you or when they finally love you many times it's hard for you to be able to receive it, based on what you've experienced in the past. So the end with situations like these come up, and this may mean it sounds like he's genuine a year i'm saying insincere and actually wants to you. Then it's so hard to be able to fathom that he even want me you i'm saying or, at the same time trying to figure out or trying to poke holes in the situation was trying to see the flowers to see was really, really matter that's too much work. yeah either. Either is real and you know that is real all it ain't real and you know that it's the fake."
16710.0,Patient,Know it's real.
740.0,Provider,that's that's.
16710.0,Patient,that's higher than.

16710.0,Patient,"I think, just like not. i'm not know what the next couple months are going to look like like i'm starting to because I had a big shock like I feel like i've been hit by a train or like a bomb fell on my house. You know and you're just like shaken up and you don't even. know what to think yet like i'm ready for the dust to settle and it's just going to take time."
740.0,Provider,You know your.
16710.0,Patient,Emotions until the dust settles.
740.0,Provider,"Right, I mean you're not going to know what's going to happen in the next couple of months. yeah right, the only thing you can do is take it one day at a time. We got to where you, you know, to offer you thought would say don't push the carriage don't push the horse before. the cart before the horse right. Because, at the end of the day when you try to push something. When you try to push something ahead of something else that's how you end up overwhelmed and you end up stress that because we try to act like a fortune tellers and remind readers and we just couldn't see the future you guys, the only way, you can do. Is focus on what's happening today, and today you are loved to. somebody wants you today, you love somebody and today you're going to finish the Semester."
