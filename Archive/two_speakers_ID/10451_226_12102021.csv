As a as a perk so before that I was going I was utilizing the SPA I was getting massages I was doing yoga getting really heavily into it, then the pandemic hit and I lost my job of 10 years. and yeah Mike went on. So that like that outlet was gone it got completely taken away from me, so I found another outlet, which was core power yoga and it was a hot yoga class and it's $80 it's really expensive. month and. And even lost without a mouse like a like I get it you already without a mask with a mask I can't even imagine you're in like 110 degree room with a mask your sweat from your from your face down like it's disgusting. up doing that I got a membership at anytime fitness i've been utilized and but lately, even the gym like I have no motivation. I should have my old routine. During the pandemic my best friend was the general manager at the gym that she worked at, and we were going to him privately and we were like so we were working on a lot, but I was working out her and she was showing me techniques and stuff I could do, on my own, without her. Oh, the gym helps me a lot even walking like around my neighborhood but not like right right right across the way, like I don't want to run into him. So I go like I go to this place down the street from my house it's called the summit. A good like two and a half miles in like, then you can brown or you can run like so I was doing that a lot. I go on. And, but it's been cold lately. Though after work I go I go to the gym well. Oh. Like I feel like I need a personal trainer I need somebody to kind of push me. I might need like to get into a boot camp, or something I don't know."
226.0,Provider,"Because you know anxiety just has to be managed. managed manage. Like every day, even when you don't have anxiety. What about meditation We tried that before."

10451.0,Patient,and
226.0,Provider,"I would go hold on, let me say so it's really it's Chapter four and it's it's under relaxation, so it talks about the importance of relaxation, it talks about how shallow breathing affects your whole system. And you know it goes into like abdominal breathing and it's really the abdominal breathing that you want to do because that's where you're really getting that oxygen into your system and that's when. that's how you really calm yourself down and that's how you keep your mind in your body really calm. it's like it starts at like page 90."

10451.0,Patient,Okay.
226.0,Provider,"So don't worry about that sometimes that's off putting for people they're like oh no I don't want to do that. But you know anxiety and depression, has to be, it has to be managed like it has to be managed every day, you have to do something every day. Even when you're not feeling depressed or even when you're not feeling anxious, you know you have to do something, whether it's like exercise meditation yoga you know you're coming you're calming your mind your mind is calm your body is calm right."

I just kind of need a new challenge and I need something to spark my interest again that's why, like, I want to possibly look into yoga instructing and."
226.0,Provider,yeah you can get your certification not sure if core power offers that that I know there's plenty of other studios that do.
10451.0,Patient,"yeah they do actually it's like $2,000."
226.0,Provider,"yeah that's about right. Okay, so that's good that would just give you kind of mix things up a little bit you know you could still be do your best titian work and then teach some yoga classes, you know. However, you would like you know, whatever that looks like. Okay, so let's talk some like short term and long term goals, what are what are a couple of short term goals that you want to work on."
10451.0,Patient,short term equals. I want to start saving my money. there's no excuse to not save my money because I live at home. But I have a spending problem I do. I I feel like i'm working paycheck to paycheck. For us to pay off my pay my bills and sometimes splurge on whatever I want in.
226.0,Provider,What are you spending your money on to save a spending problem why.
10451.0,Patient,"It would it's just like stuff that I need like I don't have any winter clothes so like I you know I bought a pair of to two new pair of jeans you know, like that don't have holes in them like you know it's just like it's not a luxury. it's up that I do need, but then like I splurged on a pair of Vincent camacho boots that I didn't need it. But I got like I got a good paycheck so I was like I can't afford it, but now now i'm like pinching pennies because of it."
226.0,Provider,hey all right so saving money is a short term goal that's a good goal so maybe what you want to do is come up with a number like set aside have a separate account that you know you just transfer money. You get a paycheck it goes into your account and then take X amount out and put it into another.
10451.0,Patient,account.
226.0,Provider,And you just kind of.
10451.0,Patient,You know. that's kind of what I need to start doing.
226.0,Provider,You know so.
10451.0,Patient,You know.
226.0,Provider,"Maybe like before you get paid again, or when you can get to the bank just go and open another account."
10451.0,Patient,and I have logic spanking and I have a Bank of America.
226.0,Provider,"So you know just make sure you're taking that waste, whatever the number looks like to you sometimes some amount out of their chair that you know that goes straight into savings that you can."
10451.0,Patient,They say 10% the eke out of your paycheck he put it into the status quo.
226.0,Provider,"And if you just keep doing that you'll realize like wow you know i've got no saving money you know, and you know really think about like when you think you want to buy something. Look at it as Okay, how many hours will I need to work to pay for this. So you know if something costs $300 you're going to go Okay, how many you know eight hour days, do I have to work for that. So if I have to work, you know 338 hour days i'm just throwing out numbers, but you know, so I would take three whole days to just pay for this Is this something that I need."
10451.0,Patient,yeah.
226.0,Provider,"So, looking at it that way. can be it can you know, bring you back to reality and go Do I really need this is just a need or a want."
10451.0,Patient,"So yeah that's The other thing too like I work on like I work I get paid by working on the amount of people I see. I get paid hourly, but I also get paid a Commission based. On my tips, but all my go to it goes to gas. In the you know. To come I do I commuted be about 25 minutes away from work I work in."
226.0,Provider,thousand oaks.
10451.0,Patient,"So I leave our before I start, and I get there just about like 15 minutes prior to my shift and I clock in on my phone. yeah like it's been coming a routine but I didn't have a job for like 10 months. So going back was really weird to me."
226.0,Provider,"yeah it's like getting back into the swing of it, you know it's just and that creates a little bit of insight into so."
10451.0,Patient,"um well, I want to get a new car. As a financial advisor that helped me through Pepsi and she also put me like. She works at Toyota. got me a good connection with Toyota. So I could get a really good sticker price deal or whatever they're offering for the month of December January."
226.0,Provider,"Okay, what how what's your goal like what's the timeframe in terms of buying a new car."
10451.0,Patient,I wanted to do it like on my day.
226.0,Provider,"Okay, so that's in two weeks or. To me."
10451.0,Patient,"You are a third, so a. few weeks away and but yeah. You know I could be February."
226.0,Provider,yeah totally that's what like you know you want to just make sure that you've got enough obviously and. You can cover the payments and. you'll be okay. I was like.
10451.0,Patient,"I could start building my credit again. I got. My start just kind of being part of you know, like yeah I could start getting my own identity again like oh."
226.0,Provider,"yeah and that's also a really important point that you bring up you know you know regaining your identity, because your identity was wrapped up in that really bad relationship. You know where you're spending a lot of money on and you're being physically and emotionally abused that's you're obviously very traumatizing that takes time to heal from. And the best way to heal is to find yourself and to do things for yourself create your own identity, as you said, create your own independence. Your own autonomy so you're no longer attached to that relationship, you are your own person and now you're in a healthy relationship so focusing on not self sabotaging that relationship, because the because he's nice feels new and weird and different. And being Nice and giving and spending on you is how it should be that's healthy."
10451.0,Patient,yeah.
226.0,Provider,So don't get confused unhealthy is what you had.
10451.0,Patient,"But I don't want to have any resentment, you know, like because i'm not contributing enough or like."
226.0,Provider,"So the conversation can be look, you know, and you might have had this already i'm not in a place right now, where I can contribute a lot when I get there, then I will you know, but what you contribute is your time together having a good time laughing creating memories, you know. Being in a relationship isn't about how much you spend on the other person it's the it's the amount of time that you spend together and the connection that you have. So there's things that you that don't cost a lot of money or don't even cost anything that you can do that are really fun and healthy and. A way to connect."
10451.0,Patient,"yeah like tonight we're going to my cousin sweater party. And he's going to meet me there and then we're going to go and just you know, be a part of the white elephant, and you know I get to introduce him to my cousin finally. And everybody what's what's really scary is the last time I was there, there was an incident with my axe murderer, and it was very. i'm trying not to remember it but it's like it's it's like kinda like it's not the same, like, I cannot keep comparing him, then you know, like I can't like. I know that people aren't really weren't you engaged last time I saw you like i'm scared that i'm going to have people come up to me tonight asking me like who you know who's this guy like. Oh."
226.0,Provider,yeah. You can say yeah I was and now i'm not. what's your boyfriend's name. Matthew Matthew. Matthew.

226.0,Provider,You are okay.

226.0,Provider,"I would talk to shontelle. yeah don't do that without talking to Sean tell. Okay, because we don't want you getting into a place where you take a big dip and a dive that doesn't need to happen that's what we want to avoid okay. Okay, so whenever you and I know that you want to eventually get off the medication and I get that Okay, but let's do this let's let's do this the right way. Make sure, make sure that you have a conversation with shauntel because she's going to be able to guide to pay she's going to be able to say hey let's try this let's do this okay. Because."
10451.0,Patient,A lot of anxiety lately is because i've been weaning myself off.
226.0,Provider,"And and and that could be and so here's here's here's another thought it's like maybe waiting to do that, until after the first of the year. yeah now there's a lot coming up with the holidays, sometimes people, it can be tough for people you still have some trauma ptsd from your past relationship. Like maybe processing that first before you start to get off the medication, you know let's let's do this methodically."
10451.0,Patient,"Okay, are taking my normal dose."
