510.0,Provider,"Oh daughter in law you're right you're right sorry about that yeah okay oh goodness is she is she doing Okay, are the symptoms mild severe okay."
11310.0,Patient,"Okay, all right now."
510.0,Provider,"yeah just sort of taking care of herself and is she under the care she in contact with her doctor via Tele you know, medicine and. When to outreach if things were saying and OK OK that's still pretty scary. When you sort of get that news. Have you had exposure or were you around her are you at risk at this point. Okay. Okay, oh I hope she I hope she does Okay, it sounds like she's doing all right. matter kind of running its course that sounds like or symptoms are are manageable at this point."
11310.0,Patient,yeah right now.
510.0,Provider,"Okay okay um I wanted to check in and let you know and manny may have already shared this with you, but he will be your new therapist I knew, you would actually requested, so it was indeed. I got the final list this past Friday, so in my last sessions definitely this week i've been able to give people hey this is your person, so I I knew, you were going to be really happy because you actually had requested it, and it was. honored and I love that it was honor because he you scheming group so now there there won't be that feeling of a God or like start from square one, he knows you and I think. He probably knows you a little bit better than me, even though you've been very consistent with your appointments. He gets to see you actually even more regularly so you'll get to see him for individual so at the end of this week my last day is Friday. On Saturday, technically, I think that's when all my cases will be officially transferred to the new people and the care nav team, they will outreach you or send texts email, however you've asked to be notified to come to the virtual. clinically Okay, so you should get a text saying come to the virtual clinic to schedule, you know appointments with your new therapist so that's that's how it should be if, for whatever reason, that isn't happening, you can just call in to say hey I need to get on manny schedule. Okay, and. And the other piece, so I was really pleased to see that you, you got manny and then manny and Dr Malik and I all consulted after your last session and I think. I told you, I was going to outreach them and talk to them about moving you to bi weekly, and so we we did various console snowman he should have talked to you about it did he review what we decided."
11310.0,Patient,He hasn't said anything to me.
510.0,Provider,"Oh, goodness Okay, he said, I said, do you want to tell her and the next group you'll see her before I do i'm happy to tell her but Okay, so it sounds like he did it and I apologize I you know, he was supposed to. Basically, OK, so the three of us consulted and we we agreed at the end of October, so really this started November that you would start bi weekly so give you the five so you have one more month that you will be expected to do weekly. appointments and so that was what we ended up talking about, so I would continue to participate engage do your part and group I know you attend but it's also part of that participation, and you know when. You are prompted. But that's what we all three of us agreed to so that will be something he will have to I was hoping, I could put the change in but I can't do it yet, because I won't be here at the end of October, so he will be responsible. for making that adjustment within the system that way your actual chart set it will eventually say bi weekly for groups so that way you only. have to attend, because then you know you don't want to be penalized for for weekly right your schedule, we need to match in the system, and so I thought that was. A good, a good thing to share as well i'm sorry man he didn't share that with you, but I wanted to make sure that was reviewed so."
11310.0,Patient,That yeah we had a lot of people in great okay. Please yeah log name.
510.0,Provider,"Oh really Okay, and that makes it a little trickier he said he was going to have you stay after so but no worries i'm glad. i'm glad that we're having our final session, I just wanted to kind of get you up to speed on where we were at so that's good news and eventually and i'm not saying now this takes a lot longer because. You started you started back in April, so if you continue with bright heart i've seen patients have their therapy adjusted as well, but that takes a lot longer for now, it still will be every two weeks with manny so that. won't be shifting for a bit, but the group I think you've definitely worked and shown your consistency around that, so I hope that helps what are your thoughts to that."
11310.0,Patient,like that.
510.0,Provider,"Okay, all right yeah so."
11310.0,Patient,Every week.
510.0,Provider,"yeah so it would be so finished out October weekly and then November but make sure you'll really need because I can do it, it will have to be manny are technically Dr Malik. Either one of them has to basically enter in the care intensity adjustment, so you just want to make sure that happens before November, you know. are really November 1 but so just keep that in the back your head. One of them needs to do it, but yeah so I was happy to make the recommendation so that's what we agreed upon."
11310.0,Patient,yeah.
510.0,Provider,"yeah um I think for my final sessions i'm just really giving. You all this space to kind of talk about what you have found helpful with our work together if there's been a particular topic, or just anything you wanted to reflect. So far, I wanted to give you that time and space, and I also wanted to ask if there are you know, as you will eventually transition to manny, what do you think the goals. And what are the things that you to want to work on if you've been thinking about that, and if you haven't I want to prompt for you to be thinking about that, what do you want to be focusing on. So those are my two questions for you, so what has been most helpful or least helpful amanda I mean I always love feedback good bad in between what have you found helpful in our work together."
11310.0,Patient,going to therapy often do you go into group actually. yeah yeah like it.
510.0,Provider,"Are there particular topics that were discussed resonate with you more than others, that you find helpful, do you like hearing other people's stories and just realizing you're not alone like what if you found helpful about whether its individual or the group."
11310.0,Patient,"That i'm not alone. Okay, what people here, then they got on there."
510.0,Provider,"yeah was that surprising when you were in the group that you heard those stories or did you know other people were going through it, or was it, you know, once you were in it and kind of hearing what was it like for you."
11310.0,Patient,It. Really. kind of cool that way I know i'm not going on out there. yeah make. Some new friends in Greece.
510.0,Provider,Can yeah you.
11310.0,Patient,Like to be intimate with every week you mean it's like and then you miss them like somebody's not there and then you're like wow where they are today.
510.0,Provider,"yeah yeah and that's that speaks to group cohesiveness right when you start to recognize and you, you really are forming that cohesiveness and when someone isn't there you're like where are they you know hope they're doing. Okay, I. can't wait to see him next week and yeah so that's good and you've been very consistent, so you definitely have seen i'm sure people who are more consistent or less consistent so."
11310.0,Patient,Okay yeah.
510.0,Provider,"yeah Okay, so it sounds like the group is super validating What about individually, and I know, sometimes when I prompt for questions, sometimes you're not sure what to talk about other times there are things that you do, but what is this process for individual been like because it's been. Different it's been tough it's."
11310.0,Patient,"been good for you like, what did. You think good."
510.0,Provider,OK OK OK yeah having that time and space.
11310.0,Patient,Are you there.
510.0,Provider,"Oh, I mean, can you hear me. Oh i'm listening to amanda you're frozen. Oh. amanda. My Internet is working my seat oh I lost her okay so she is it looks like you're rejoining there you are."
11310.0,Patient,"I don't know what happened it with you, was there, but I couldn't hear anything you said or nothing so."
510.0,Provider,"yeah you froze on me and anytime I always check my own system, and I was checking in my system was up and running and like oh."

11310.0,Patient,yeah it was a my again I think it's my bluetooth.
510.0,Provider,"Okay, I know, sometimes I just some people if they have a call come in it kicks them out of their zoom and i'm sure there's a way you can change that but okay good you're back. You know so well good i'm glad the process has been helpful and you've been really consistent. With your appointments and I appreciate that and that says a lot about your investment around your sobriety and your treatment as you transition to manny and what do you think you want to continue from a one to one perspective, have you thought about what you. Are there any particular goals that you're thinking you want to kind of. continue to work on with him."
11310.0,Patient,Just basically what we talked about.
510.0,Provider,"yeah. yeah yeah and I know we've talked about self care we've talked about making sure you know, using compassion kind of giving yourself that kindness, just like you would to others. Because we know, sometimes that inner critic can get really, really vicious. So. Well, good it sounds like you continue to stay on top of your goals i'm assuming no concerns and medications any relapses cravings urges since we last chatted. Okay. and your support system, it sounds like that is still in place have there been any significant changes since we last chatted no. yeah okay so what's it again okay all right, well, I really appreciate your time i'm glad we had our final session today if you didn't have anything else i'm going to wish you the best take care, and you will start to work with manny hopefully quite soon."
