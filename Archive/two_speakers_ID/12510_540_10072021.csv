12510.0,Patient,"There is no closure. There is no closer when someone when someone passes away that you're close to you know, so I just. I don't know i'm just i'm tired and I don't feel like doing anything and I don't feel like going to work and I don't feel like going, because I know it's going to be a hassle having to you know, take the bus or right here, all the way to San Jose and i'm just tired I just.

Five or six o'clock and. I just i'm trying to cut Kathy now as much as possible and that's not helping either."
540.0,Provider,mean Murray you're also going through some so you already had. Some grief that you haven't been able to do. And then on. Another loss.
12510.0,Patient,yeah.
540.0,Provider,So a lot of times when the system was. Trying to work itself out and. just starting to start to work on the process of grief and then you put another one. it's gonna be hard.
12510.0,Patient,yeah.
540.0,Provider,"And I know, and I know that it doesn't feel like you can get closure when you lose someone, that is. So close and near to you, but eventually once you start to be able to work."
12510.0,Patient,through all of it you've endured.
540.0,Provider,"that's when you start to find the closure, but right now you're not close to that at all, because you kind of you now it's just piled one on one on one, so now we have to start working and like we've talked about before where you you. etch slowly, as you can. Right now, it feels very far away. And it may, it may be so right now I feel like you're going to get that closure. But the slower that you can go to it and even doing it, little by little. that's okay. it's gonna happen were you able to do page."
12510.0,Patient,yeah I read like I read like them like a chapter and I haven't. I haven't been able to go back to it but i'm gonna. try and get some more reading done tomorrow.
540.0,Provider,What has the reading bent on and for like this chapter so far.
12510.0,Patient,"It must deal with. Like how I guess. kind of just dealing with things it in general, and I, you know i'm trying to like pay attention when i'm reading but i'm just so like it's so hard to concentrate and stay focused and my memory so bad that I just. it's like I can't even. Remember."
540.0,Provider,"So, right now, it may you may have to go even if. He may have to go at it and. scan it first with like a highlighter so when you're reading something a lot of times, or even having the reading and then writing on. Of what you're reading. A lot of times that. will help gain the information, a little bit. I know that you're exhausted, and a lot of this is."
12510.0,Patient,going to be pretty time consuming.
540.0,Provider,"For you definitely don't want to push yourself too much, but it could help you get out of that mode exhaustion by by letting your brain getting."
12510.0,Patient,If that makes sense. I know.
540.0,Provider,I heard right now.
12510.0,Patient,"yeah i'm just like. I don't know I when I feel like i'm okay or and I feel like i'm having like a like a normal day I just. I feel like I don't need. Not that I don't need. therapy, but it's just I feel like Why do I even have to deal with it right now, you know just if those like."
540.0,Provider,Maria do you think it would be better for you to do every other week that may help split up this therapy so that's not so taxing on you every.
12510.0,Patient,"single week. yeah it's just I know that I do need the therapy and I know that you know i'm. there's going to be a day, where something's going to set me off and i'm a spiral and i'm really going to need the help. But it's just so frustrating I hate group therapy, I absolutely hate it and I don't want to do it yeah. I am i'm doing it out of obligation, you know I don't go to group therapy I won't get my it one."
540.0,Provider,More. Try to lessen a little bit of I don't want to. see each other twice a month and then. Obviously you'll do groups. And then hopefully that will be able to relieve. Some of the stress comes. Seeing someone twice a week and maybe a little too much right.
12510.0,Patient,Now yeah yeah.
540.0,Provider,Why don't we why don't we plan on reconvening not next week.
12510.0,Patient,But the following week or.
540.0,Provider,"Okay, at this time."
12510.0,Patient,Okay.
540.0,Provider,"Alright, so it gives you enough time to try to maybe do a little bit more reading, but you don't have to go out to reading fast you'll have. To wait. To start working on it get some rest, but if you need anything always. check and then whether or not, if it's the weekend, if I can come on or if another person will come at that point but. we'll get through this, but you may just need some of that time to start processing as well."
12510.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
540.0,Provider,"Alright, so why don't we plan on meeting in two weeks okay. Okay, all right go get some sleep."
12510.0,Patient,"All right, okay all right. bye Maria alright."
540.0,Provider,"Alright, for transcription I do want to know Tate so i'm going to be changing maria's care intensity i'll be seeing her twice a month and she'll be doing. But. group therapy, sir. I have noticed the past month that it has been a little bit harder for Maria to be active in therapy weekly, I think that it has added to the load of her stress, so I definitely don't want therapy to be one of her stressors so. I think it would be beneficial if she did twice a month and that to make it not overloaded, on her the loss of her on it's too fresh to process right now so she needs to also process on her own time so talking about that right now it's going to be a little a little much for her. And I don't want to pull away from treatment just right now she needs that space to process so going forward I may even try to just make our. Every other week sessions or twice a month sessions to be like 1530 minutes still just short check ins, I think, at this point in time, to make sure that she continues to have a good relationship with therapy. Just that space, maybe what she needs right now. Other than that nothing for transcription."
