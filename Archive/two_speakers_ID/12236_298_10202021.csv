298.0,Provider,"it's too high, of a dose for you, even though it's a small dose already I have people that take five times the amount you do to get them to sleep, I want you to cut my tablet and half and I have even people who take a half of a half. But if you wake up groggy it's too strong."
12236.0,Patient,"yeah and that's I woke up and I couldn't actually fully wake up, so I just I was like i'm not going to take this now until I began."
298.0,Provider,"yeah so try it tiny, how are your moods."
12236.0,Patient,"And they were I was doing better and then I had some problems with my daughter, and so, with the stress of my daughter, and everything like that I noticed that I was starting to just feel more just out of it like just wanting to sleep again and stuff like that. Things have gotten better between me and my daughter, but i'm still just crying for no reason one day i'm fine the next day i'm not. I keep going from happy to just not even there's, not even in between now there's just i'm either happy or really agitated."
298.0,Provider,"Okay, well, it doesn't sound like we've gotten to the right dose yet if that's still happening to you remember, I told you that we could go as high as 400. The cell i'm trying to be conservative for as long, but if you're still having the mood swings then it's not the right dose yet, and when you and what's Nice is this won't alter it won't flatten your personality which is nice sometimes. antidepressants will flatten your effect and it doesn't work that way with mood stabilizers which is nice. And so um. And Plus we have to be really careful with. antidepressants with you, because it can make you manic and so it's better to just go with the mood stabilizer and find that dose that will work better, for you. And remember that if you develop a rash, you have you know stop it, and then take talk to me about it okay. Okay, and just continue and you're going to do there any suicidal or homicidal thoughts. No, no okay um. how's your appetite."
12236.0,Patient,um I feel like i'm overeating I feel like I just want to eat constantly.
298.0,Provider,"All right, well um. anything new."
12236.0,Patient,"No i'm, the only thing that's going to be i'm going to be having gallbladder surgery. i'm gonna have my gallbladder removed yeah okay."
298.0,Provider,"And as far as i'm the wanting to eat constantly I want you to look up a medication called contrave. Okay, and that it has an antidepressant that won't affect your bipolar, but it also curb your appetite it's stopping the eating. And it is a combination drug it's pretty expensive, but if I separate it out and give you a little bit of each and do it myself your insurance will pay for it so. Think about it, and if it's something that you want to look at a little bit of weight loss and stop the eating That would be an option. Okay, and um. Anything else that you'd like to talk about."
