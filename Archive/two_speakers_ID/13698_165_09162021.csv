165.0,Provider,Okay okay so since Tuesday you've not had a full dose.
13698.0,Patient,Since Monday was my last full dose.
165.0,Provider,"Okay. Okay okay um so I um okay so here's where we're at I because of the amount of no shows, and I, and I understand the circumstances, and so, because of that, I will i'm going to. grant you a pass okay. Otherwise I would send you to group tomorrow it's called the care group and we would have we have those every day we have one every day of the week, and so at mind. Right now, my the recommendation that I must follow or should follow it says that you should go no greater than two days of medication without an appointment. Now I know Julie came very well, she trust my judgment, I will give you medication to your Tuesday group it's not going to be in a full prescription though it's going to be in two increments do you have a car now are you are you in mobile now."
13698.0,Patient,"Now I don't have a car my boyfriend does so he could. get it. For me, take me or whatever."
165.0,Provider,What time is your group on Tuesday.
13698.0,Patient,It says three well three my time.
165.0,Provider,"Okay i'm sorry in the. afternoon that's Okay, I just want to make sure that I don't want you to go without medication to So if I. Okay, so."
13698.0,Patient,"And I just want to I don't think i've had any no shows, and once I started I think they were all like in the beginning, before I could figure out like how to do it, is that correct or if I had some sense and."
165.0,Provider,"So it looks like there was a no show on. OK, so the 14th is the day of the accident right."
13698.0,Patient,yeah it says he was that one.
165.0,Provider,"So there was there was a peer support hall that shouldn't have been. marked as a no show actually hang on. They shouldn't have scheduled this in the same day if it was actually Okay, and will not change it, let me actually edit this. I don't know what it will look like, at the end, but there have been. yeah so it looks like these are pretty much like at the beginning, eight, nine and then you cancel on."
13698.0,Patient,"I don't think. I did a makeup one, for one, but I know I think I missed one or two, but that was like the beginning when I, and I was trying to get in I just wasn't doing it on time."
165.0,Provider,"yeah it's hard, but those but the therapy therapy is another one too so like you missed the bio psychosocial ways."
13698.0,Patient,So my family has had coded but I I also don't know how to get that I get notified by though about those but I know that's not your problem.
165.0,Provider,"I know it is no, it is, I mean if you're not getting notified of your groups or your appointments and that's not then that's an issue."
13698.0,Patient,"telling me by email and i'm checking those i'm terrible at checking those but um so i've tried to make it a point since then, but I. I. could be notified."
165.0,Provider,"I don't know, I think that I think. That once I mean it looks like it looks like there were some. So I looked at, through these and it looks like they actually did reach out to you by phone a couple of times oh that was 914 hours a day, the accident, so that one, let me look back here a little bit further. But they did call you on the 14th so they have started calling you and and sending you text messages. looks like there's actually an APP that you can that you can use chess. Yes, and and Jamie it looks like Jamie i'm. Okay, so it looks like on the 17th of August, they reached out to you to contact us. So I would go to the compliance, do you do, you have the X, do you know the compliance virtual clinic meeting ID."
13698.0,Patient,"I don't know, do you have it handy I could write it down."
165.0,Provider,"When I can get it for you, I don't have."
13698.0,Patient,"I don't have it right i'm not making excuses for it i'm just trying to make sure I don't miss. any more in the future, this is all i've been i've been clean for four years, and I was just getting my medication like once a month, so getting back in the swing of like."
165.0,Provider,yeah.
13698.0,Patient,"it's, but I just define."
165.0,Provider,"Unfortunately ya know and, unfortunately, so it's a whole new world the telemedicine, like a whole new worlds. completely different from anything i've been doing this almost four years, so I know, and you know, even when we started coping. And the schools are doing homeschool. yeah it was like I."
13698.0,Patient,Like.
165.0,Provider,"I had been doing this for two and a half years at that time, and I still couldn't get it like it's you know I mean it's hard I get it, I. understand, and so, but so there's just going to be like a learning curve and then you know, unfortunately, when you when you are, you know, trying to catch a grip of it. When you are you're used to being stable, we have to see stable, in order to give you longer prescriptions and so. On and so that's that's tough with a rocky start as well. So. I will, I will give you a bridge until Tuesday group. But after that we're going to be at a place where. Under I mean we're going to be in a place where you're going to have to. it's it's not going to be as easy, unfortunately, just because of where we're at like the computer system right now says two days without a without a refill until they're seen. So i'm already doing, above and beyond Julie, like I said Julie can trust my judgment, and so i'm going to make a judgment call on this one. But she really wants you to be in group, it may mean she's been writing on your prescriptions every time to refill out group so and that's where the prescriptions are written, so let me just go and then what are your withdrawal symptoms right now."
13698.0,Patient,"Other than just being a little achy and very tired, but I don't really know what's from the wreck and what's from."
165.0,Provider,You sound a little stuffy is that from.
13698.0,Patient,"coffee, but my nose is all swollen. Okay that's."
165.0,Provider,From if I heard it or if it's.
13698.0,Patient,I don't think I had coded but the rest of my family did so also just getting over sickness too so i'm not quite sure what is. Withdrawal symptoms and what's other circumstances honestly.
165.0,Provider,"I, are you having any GI issues. No okay all right so um and then have you had any relapses. No okay. Okay okay so i'm gonna let me get the I asked them for this all the time, so embarrassing um. Just like write it down somewhere what is a combined see. i'm so i'm going to call on average for you to get you to your to your appointment, I have a pharmacy of kroger and. 1093 state road bypass. Yes, me bypass okay already. So I will leave the prescription with them."
13698.0,Patient,Thank you very much.
165.0,Provider,"yeah but what I want you to do, though, is, if you have a pen handy I want you to go to the compliance virtual clinic. And I want you to talk to them about your. And you can even use my name and which should be easy to remember, because it's Danielle i'm. On the on. I need ask them to review your no shows for 914 because. And i'll send them a message to because there was you had two appointments scheduled that day and technically we can't have two appointments on one day, so they shouldn't both be no shows. One of them should be canceled because it just they shouldn't have even scheduled the insurance won't won't allow to a day so just ask them to review that and then also ask them about the chess that, like the game ch E SS APP. Okay, so they'll be able to help you out with that. and Then they'll and then that's in tell them, the reason is because you need some sort of other. reminder or way to get to group you're just you know just let them know hey i'm struggling getting getting to my appointments because i'm not the email isn't a very reliable reminder for me, or whatever you want to say yeah. And then here's the compliance vc meeting ID let me know when you're ready."
13698.0,Patient,i'm ready.
165.0,Provider,"or nine eight. Okay 168. Okay, who 2119 there's not too, too, is it's just one two. So 498 yeah please do yeah."
13698.0,Patient,Please do 498168 to 119.
165.0,Provider,"Perfect you nail that. OK OK OK, so let me and I want you to sit with me while I call in the prescription just rewrite my not really quick."
13698.0,Patient,Okay.
165.0,Provider,"And you're taking the two two tablets a day right at eight. milligrams dash two milligrams okay. And i'm going to put in there that we talked about it and that i'm giving you a pass, but that we're we're going to tighten down the we're going to bunker down and the other thing just pro tip if you call before your appointment, we will cancel it instead of no show. The notion was bad you don't want to know show cancel. cancel is completely different cancel it doesn't do anything to your chart either way, so you can cancel without being a no show and that helps."
13698.0,Patient,To just.
165.0,Provider,"I mean even like like hey my appointment starts in five minutes, but I just got a car accident, I understand, like. that's not it that's not easy to do some you know, like, I understand. That wasn't your mind priority, but like as an example, poor example sorry."
13698.0,Patient,But no you're good.
165.0,Provider,You understand what i'm saying right.
13698.0,Patient,"I even more for that, because I was gonna try i'm just gonna lay in bed, but go and I just slept right through I slept for like 48 hours almost straight, it was."
165.0,Provider,A bummer.
13698.0,Patient,don't really know why.
165.0,Provider,"Well, no, your body goes. there's trauma."
13698.0,Patient,"So let me see here. I do know that in the past, it was a rocky start but i've been trying to get better, but if this APP I think would really help me because the only reason that I have. I think i've missed since i've started it just because I wasn't aware of them and I know like i'm not trying to make an excuse that was it's on me to know, am I just yeah i'm not used to."
165.0,Provider,"It totally makes sense, I understand that there's a transition there's totally it's totally a learning curve it's totally a learning curve, I absolutely get it. So this is going to be a seven day supply Danielle i'm it's weird to say that to somebody else. So it's going to be a seven day supply it's going to give you enough medication to get you one day pass your appointment so you'll have a full day of medication on Wednesday. But don't let that deter you like, when you look at your bottles and see that you're you know you have to whatever like remember that when you have two tabs left or even three tabs left your about time for a group, like. that'll be a good reminder for you yeah if you don't like know that like hey I only have three tabs left that means I have a group. Today, or whatever okay. um. I want you know we want people to get better we're not here to be mean you know what I mean so. We would do want to make sure that you are taken care of and medicated and all that good stuff so um let me go ahead and call your pharmacy and then i'm just going to disconnect from audio and then i'll come back in from to audio and i'm done okay."
13698.0,Patient,"Okay, thank you. hold on a video call with my doctor. says hey. Fresh. pepper. visit me. It. going to come in and a little bit. A little bit it's hot out here."
165.0,Provider,"Alright well that long wait That was all I was on hold. Okay, so it's left with them, they have the prescription there I did include on the sig that you must be seen for further refills so. i'm going to i'm going to put that in your chart that we talked about it, and that we understand that we're we're where you're at but we're just going to start where we're at and move forward okay."
13698.0,Patient,Okay perfect Thank you so much.
