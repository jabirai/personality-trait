I also. struggle with depression. But postpartum is only for a couple years and it's been you know, three since my last birth and no like. should probably talk to someone if this is still this bad and. it's getting in the way of me. doing more for the kids like you know saying yes to two or three park goes a day. Sometimes, I just want to stay in bed in a cold dark room, with all the you know lights off air conditioner on it's quiet and. My kids come and go hey mom can we go to the park, can I can, can we go later today when it's not so hard, or can we go tomorrow and. yeah I feel like i'm making too many excuses with the me like I still take them out and do a lot we went camping this weekend, you know.

That we were getting along with we have kids the same age and she keeps asking for my address, and I am so reluctant to give it to her, because she told me this story about another friend she had they were like. She wanted to be pen pals and the other friend didn't she's like i'm not good writing letters and the mutual friend was like that's Okay, you know i'll send you letters and then like. She got a couple back from the other person and they stopped and then she told me like she started writing letters to the husband that she showed up at the House a couple times and like trying to figure out what happened and talk to me just like that seems like a lot. It for someone that you said it was Okay, they didn't write you back."
226.0,Provider,Right.
15286.0,Patient,"So i'm. i've been like ruminating on that for a couple months, but like she still wants my address only and I don't want to do. Because I don't I don't want to slight her because we have mutual friends, I don't want this she seemed. she's really nice, but at the same time she's like talking about that other lady that stopped talking to her and she's like I think she's bipolar or something and i'm like that's kind of judging you too. But like this seems like a small thing that I shouldn't be thinking about so much."
226.0,Provider,So i'm other. Like do ruminate over other thoughts to.

My step mom my first step mom not her used to hit me when I was like from two to five, they said, every day, I came to school, I was crying people started hitting me at the wedding when I was to like he's just maybe alert me he's a narcissistic jerk pretty much not protecting his kids."

What did I did not reach out again."
226.0,Provider,Do you have do you have a relationship with your mom.
15286.0,Patient,"So she's been the opposite of my dad in my life my dad was kind of neglectful my mom. So when I read about narcissistic families and like how some people have the golden child I feel like i'm her golden child like she was planning my life. She was living through me she was like she would PowerPoint presentation like here are your options, if you want to like. go to school and have us pay for it, like you can do this, and you can do that, and like yeah that's I mean for living in a parents house that's reasonable for them to have you know expectations, but like it was all laid out for me like here's your menu of your life and and. It wasn't all a cart it was a prefix. she's she's been taking over I i've been distancing myself because she's been trying to take over with my kids a lot like she tried to potty train them she's been lying to me about. taking care of them like where she goes with them and, like I don't think she's going to do anything bad with them, I just don't appreciate. being treated like the third wheel, with my own kids you know. yeah um. But lying really got to me that. Just. Just ways that I choose to raise them and, like trying not to dress them up in the dresses and the dolls and all the pink and the like i'm they can choose what they want. And like she was laying out dresses on their bed, and like telling me no I haven't gotten that many dresses at all, and like. The potty training thing is huge to me because i'm like don't train them before they're ready, I told you not. To do that before they're ready and they're not ready and that's my job. She was overstepping a lot."
226.0,Provider,So she doesn't have many boundaries.
15286.0,Patient,"No she's horrible noun chase you would read my diary she would come in my room all the time, like. I had no privacy from her."
226.0,Provider,yeah right. Are you working. Okay.
15286.0,Patient,"um I work for family and for my grandma i'm a property manager she lives, I would have added town, and so I managed. three buildings and ventura and then I helped manage one in thousand oaks with my cousin, which is a medical billing but. i'm in charge of three commercial properties."
226.0,Provider,"Okay, so that's full time."
15286.0,Patient,I work from home so that's nice I get to spend lots of time with the kids and i'm just. Running paperwork all day. Calling contractors and stuff.
226.0,Provider,Like that imagine.
15286.0,Patient,"it's not horrible like. Unless there's a big project going on it's pretty quiet, you know, aside from day my toilets leaking like okay here's the plumber."
226.0,Provider,wow okay good all right.
15286.0,Patient,That work is not a lot of stress in my life.
226.0,Provider,Okay So what do you get the biggest what's the biggest stress in your life right now.
15286.0,Patient,"i'm gonna say like family and social stuff has always been. The biggest stress like. i've been opening up to my extended family, a lot more recently like this year, which is, I am really surprised at myself like talking to my aunts and setting boundaries like with my mom like. My my grandma wasn't doing so well, she was in the hospital in and out she has dementia and there was the she got put on hospice she got taken off yeah but. My mom was going over there, half the week and then my aunt the other half and and it seemed like for a while they were trying to. invite me over when only my mom was there to you know, and I set a boundary with my hands and like look i'm not going to get into details, but. Can I come over when it when it is there and mom and it's going to take we're not like on horrible terms but it's going to take a while, for us to be on like good happy terms. And they they were receptive and they listened, and that was it was really helpful."
226.0,Provider,"Okay, and then what about your husband's side of the family, do you. Do you guys get along to get no okay."
15286.0,Patient,"His dad's okay his mom. His mom doesn't get along with any of her daughters in laws, I guess. God yeah she's. she's one of the she came over and like when my first was born like not even my mom had come over yet, and I helped her like she was helping me do the first baby bath in the little tub and stuff like that. And then, after we get out of the bathroom like I pick up the baby and she blocks me and she's like give me the baby and i'm like. No i'm like I don't I don't feel safe when you just block me like that, and then, when she was leaving she grabbed my legs and she shook them and i'm like I just gave birth. Like three days ago she she shook my knees back and forth like next time you need to let me hold."
226.0,Provider,wow.
15286.0,Patient,"And that was the start of our bad relationship before that it was fine once I had kids sheet like flip the switch and I think she was, I think she was worried that our relationship would be bad like her, other. Endless us. yeah."
226.0,Provider,That does your.
15286.0,Patient,fulfillment prophecy.
226.0,Provider,Exactly does your husband get along with her like to see.
15286.0,Patient,"Not as much she gets along better with his dad she gets along with his older brother and he's. I think he has resentment about that that she like she won't respond to his tax but. If he talks to his dad then she'll get back to him. yeah his brothers the golden child in their family like they have supported numerous failed businesses for him and then like carrot would come up with something smaller and really well thought out and they're like no. So he feels like. They moved away from the House that he grew up in to move closer to his brother to and like. he feels kind of slighted by them constantly except for his dad who's you know always putting in a word, for him."
226.0,Provider,"Okay um. Any legal issues right. Okay, any financial issues that you're dealing with right now."
15286.0,Patient,"No actually my husband negotiated for a raise from my grandma for me, a couple years. Which. was really helpful of him, but also, I feel kind of silly for not doing it myself. Because we weren't doing well, a couple years ago and it was like paycheck to paycheck. and"
226.0,Provider,"Has that result it's it's improved so much thanks to him not me I it wasn't me that did it, which is why i'm like."
15286.0,Patient,Kicking myself. yeah we're good.
226.0,Provider,"Okay, so are you have you met with shontelle yet."
15286.0,Patient,I don't think no.
226.0,Provider,"Okay, do you have an appointment with shontelle for she's a nurse practitioner for prescriber just curious."
15286.0,Patient,Maybe I did I don't I don't. I don't think.
226.0,Provider,"I know it gets confusing there's a lot of us in the beginning, and so have you decided that you're not going to do any kind of medication, then."
15286.0,Patient,"I would like to try first without medication, because I also haven't had therapy, I think I did talk to shawn tell because she asked me that question."
226.0,Provider,yeah that was shauntel okay so you've never had therapy in the past.
15286.0,Patient,know when I was seven my parents were doing a divorce court for a new custody battle and they had me go to someone for like two or three sessions that was like rearrange this dollhouse and hit the couch with this phone by as hard as you want and she's fine. I was they use that as the excuse for me to not get tested for anything for my entire adult lessons.
226.0,Provider,"Okay, so let's talk about a couple goals, what are some okay want to work on in therapy."
15286.0,Patient,"When I was talking with Carla at a different place Carla different place we were talking about. More balance between my Overdoing things and my not wanting to do anything for the kids like I want to be there for the kids I don't want to like I want to be able to set boundaries more I want to be able to like let people know what I need. And at the same time, honestly, as a lot more. Or at least maybe find a compromise like not maybe not a third hike today, maybe we just you know walk to the little Park, or you know, maybe not the third park today, maybe we just take a ride to a duck pond or something but."
226.0,Provider,"compromising yeah that's good. um. So. The Overdoing and the not doing. can be. related right, because if you overdo you're not going to feel like doing something for two or three days. So the Overdoing is where boundaries will come in and some negotiating and say hey let's do this, instead of this so it's about. Making it it's about having things kind of flow and where you're not feeling depleted and you're not feeling overwhelmed and you're not feeling so fatigued and tired. That you want to stay in bed all day, so we have to watch that, though, because that could be that's the depression kind of sneaking into. Okay, so sometimes like with therapy once you start talking about the things that have made that make you depressed that that are weighing on you, that are challenging difficult challenging to to work through. That will that kind of eases eases those feelings of sadness or. You know the depression part, so we just need to keep an eye to see if you know, because if you're feeling like okay well the therapy part isn't enough, I might need to go on some medication, then you know we'll just like constantly assess for that I know that that's not your first choice. For sure, and I know that you're sensitive to medications and. Sean tells great you know Sean i'm certainly not i'm certainly not pushing medication here. shauntel is very, very good. She doesn't overprescribe. And I think that that's something that can also really impact people when there's just they're taking way too many medications right, so you know let's just kind of let's just keep an eye on that we weren't a monitor your depression and. You know, see how how you're doing and."
15286.0,Patient,let's see let's.
226.0,Provider,Go ahead.
15286.0,Patient,"On the same lines of depression feel like when I do make it out of the bedroom, I would like to be a little more positive with my husband, I feel like when i'm if I complain about something that puts him in a bad mood and then his bad moods and you know we kind of just like."
226.0,Provider,Right yeah okay.
15286.0,Patient,We both mirrors.
226.0,Provider,yeah.
15286.0,Patient,Is it hit me.
226.0,Provider,"So that's where the therapy can help as well, because then you and I talked about the things that are bugging you and you don't have to take it to your husband like you can kind of get it out and talk about it and we're going to talk about some coping skills to. But it sounds like you do have like you've got coping skills like you're hiking you know are sorry. camping this weekend. You know stuff like that, but you know these coping skills are real it so. anxiety and depression, have to be managed so here's what I say to clients depression is when you're living in the past and anxiety is when you're thinking about the future anxiety is about creating something that hasn't happened yet. So when you're thinking about the future and what might happen you're going to create you're going to create some very uncomfortable feeling. Internally Okay, because you're it's worry and you're thinking oh my God. You know this this and this right. So when you're getting that racing heart and your hands are sweating you're obviously going into anxiety mode okay. Sometimes anxiety is triggered by little things big things and things you don't even know. there's kind of appears so there's ways to manage all of this manage depression managing society so we'll talk a lot about that too. it's coping skills, you know, like okay what am I going to do. You know how do you manage anxiety medication meditation yoga walking."
15286.0,Patient,breathing to do more yoga.
226.0,Provider,grounding grounding exercises and you have to do this on a daily basis it's a routine okay.
15286.0,Patient,it's more than once a day.
226.0,Provider,"yeah it's not just like Okay, well, I think I should do it today no it's like every day, you want to your your goal is to manage your field you're managing your emotions you're managing the depression and the anxiety so we'll talk more about that okay um. Okay, so are there, certain days and times that work better, for you."
15286.0,Patient,"morning is like nine or later you're usually good strap off is maybe like eight 815. For my oldest and then. I can, I can usually do day times."
226.0,Provider,So can can you do with a nine or a 10 be better on a Wednesday.
