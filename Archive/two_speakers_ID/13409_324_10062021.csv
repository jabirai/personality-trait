A couple times literally I was like oh my God a few more minutes obviously here. You know, but a couple of times throughout the day and like I said they have Apps to even on YouTube they have little short ones. yeah i've used a couple of white three minutes. And just I mean it makes such a difference so you've got to remember to take your vehicle."
13409.0,Patient,"yeah it's hard. it's hard to separate it all, because it all becomes this big ball of. hectic feelings. So I will try to do that, though, because I don't I was a girl, no, no, no we're not eating thing. anorexic. So you don't always know i'm hungry. I have scheduled meals, or at least steps. So we'll get back on top of that."
324.0,Provider,"yeah you know and it's no more than. I don't know what what types of her life but i'm like on a Sunday evening, maybe. Maybe one or two dishes and we put one in freezer and meal prepping helps a lot. yeah intestine and take them out, and you know you know one dish one or two days and then for the other one out to get through the rest of the week."
13409.0,Patient,"We were talking about doing that, while he was in treatment, but he's almost done as far as we know. At least with the first round. But it's it's something i'd like to do.

324.0,Provider,Even. And when you say that. But to your self care car.
13409.0,Patient,Then.
324.0,Provider,"go out and take a 10 minute walk and go somewhere and just sit with them. yeah and and relax and just meditate animals, because I have them to you probably heard. You know they take me to a happy place. yeah and so i'm able to. Even with mine I get them in I kind of just for that moment forget about everything else was born on."
13409.0,Patient,That. I knew yeah now that I know works. You don't usually think about it during all the drama but yeah.
324.0,Provider,"yeah. yeah I want you to take care of yourself. As far as you know, who's going on, I do have to any point any self harm box."
13409.0,Patient,"No, not so. To hit him a lot you. And I know it's naive, but i'm i'm kind of hoping, something has sparked in his mind, yes, we will leaguer asked coma or not cancer or not rather. Put your shit together, hopefully, that works, I know, but. We never actually left the House before."
324.0,Provider,"And this, one of the I just I don't know what the term. i'm going to call it, maybe caregiver stress, but what I have learned those that are closest to you when they're going through a lot they. tend to kind of push those closest to them. away. And I don't think it is intentional, but I think some of it, he may have feared, he was thinking you know. yeah there may be their fear is there, so they tend to kind of. I guess maybe act out and. yeah they're pushing those that are closest to them away not realizing hey you know which of those away we're you know we're going to be out the door."
13409.0,Patient,"We had a talk. That were brief one and. You know I said. you're an asshole all the time, but a drunk asshole is a intolerable situation, I will not deal with any more of it either drink and be by yourself, or don't and we can at least tolerate being near you. But no, you will die alone, and if you keep this and and soon. They told him not to drink. A couple beers fine but. Yet, three days off in these two of them here is completely blazed."
324.0,Provider,"Is it cold, is it colon cancer."

324.0,Provider,"What am I not he'll be there, but. yeah definitely alcohol. People don't realize alcohol to see it was for. The risk of cancer. yeah. Does he does he feel issue with alcohol, does he think there's a problem."
13409.0,Patient,"He thinks it's hard to quit but he I don't. I talked him into the employee assistance program but I don't know if he went more than the first time. So I don't think he knows that he's an alcoholic. He knows he's got a heartbeat it's hard for him to I don't understand the correlation between cleaning the House and being drunk that doesn't make sense to me. But. we're having our Halloween party we. canceled it and then it's back on again so he's cleaning a lot, I know, with me being off pain medication entirely I can help much so, he wanted to clean the House me just got completely wasted nothing really got clean. I don't understand I don't understand. Wanting to feel out of control. hi hi."
324.0,Provider,"And if anything issue like that alcohol is. What helps him cope with what yeah. What people will do that you. know what helps you cope, and they place their particular. Drug drug of choice. yeah alcohol or whatever before that becomes their coping. record."

324.0,Provider,I don't live. In America.
13409.0,Patient,"Okay yeah I don't I don't wanna I don't want to increase it if it's just situational I have enough medication and be. ready to get that. Oh shoot her room. or she's gonna kill. left the door open because he likes to sleep in there at night, but it looks like. scrappy got in there and got her garbage can."
324.0,Provider,Oh scrappy.
13409.0,Patient,"and Feed on this link and apparently. boy dogs I swear. This is why we don't have them. I think. He said November he's supposed to be having his own place by November. So hopefully. scrappy will at least be spending weekends, with this person again."
324.0,Provider,"My Facebook medications when you put them up. you'll see it on there, you should have a refill on on on both."
13409.0,Patient,"Thank you, has one less thing to worry about. Last time they had a problem with my medication Aaron showed up in uniform and they could not help him fast enough oh your medical to oh my God i'm sorry okay let's fix it. By whatever words. I have this I have don't want them to fix it and and like maybe try methadone or something and get off it completely faster.

324.0,Provider,"Okay, and then the morphing."
13409.0,Patient,"Yes, which is what we've been cutting back on but. This is a really big cut back. To none."
324.0,Provider,For the morphing which one you said they're running out of. The pills for more. Now this is. My. area. But with you being on the people North thing that. We do have pain doctors that board part.
13409.0,Patient,"Oh. I don't think it's a matter of the prescription no I think it's to fill it it's walgreens. Always. it's it's either oh we've we've run out. pretty much with both of them there they always don't have it in stock whenever I I submit my prescription you can't submit it. So. Usually I have. Extra as as a buffer. Because it happens so often, but I don't anymore. said again."
324.0,Provider,"We do have special is it by heart. yeah. I know you have any doctor already good. condition of the pharmacy. yeah OK OK, I see what you're saying."
13409.0,Patient,"because sometimes health mental to get involved in, and they have their own pharmacy but it's the. Controlled substance they can't send anything. It has to be physically picked up. olivia the way. Just might be a lot bit you're doing it."
324.0,Provider,isn't an option to change just completely turn farmer.
13409.0,Patient,"In theory, yes i'd have to go through my pain specialist, but this is the one I switched to after one of the texts called my neurosurgeons office and talk to one of the medical assistance into saying I had to take she messed with my medication, right after back surgery. So, instead of being on a little bit more for a week, I was on less a lot less right after back surgery. And they weren't going direct they weren't going to do anything about that, so I switched to a different walgreens. But they're usually consist, they were consistently, the only one that would structure. This most of the time. morphine is not all that common I mean like biking in and yeah but, having been on it 15 years that doesn't work. Sure, would be nice when it's gone."
324.0,Provider,"Oh good point you're still in the process of trying to. Still paper download the dog. Yes, okay."
13409.0,Patient,"They don't want me to go too fast, because of relapse. So it's i'm i'm impatient but i'm also not stupid I don't like the pain I don't like the pain and definitely don't like withdrawals it's just messes with my head, because my all of my family's addicted to something, and now I am to. It was something I was very proud of. stuff happens I."
324.0,Provider,"And what happens is so many. So many people you I mean you're in pain it's not that. yeah I just take this just. For. yeah right, you know back surgery, I mean a serious and you have to control pain and so that's what happens. These applications after. A certain length of time, then it becomes. dependent develop. Well, and."
13409.0,Patient,"For 10 years I couldn't get a doctor to even send me for an MRI they they would just say, well, if you just take the medicine, I gave you. Medicines down your fix it. So after 10 years I finally got somebody doctor after doctor after doctor somebody's friend he sent me for a scan and i'll be darned there really was something physically wrong with my back. Only i'm on all this pain medication so. Having to stop working and and all the depression and and. boredom and not. just sitting around. Because it's really hard to tell your body to exercise when it's already in pain. So things things got a lot worse because of that and there's really nothing I can do about that anger. or not it usually it's usually you but not this time."
324.0,Provider,"With me. How. I can't remember if he. told me. days or not let's see, I have Wednesday or Thursday. about a month from now, which would be either the third or the fourth."
