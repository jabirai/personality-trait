8621.0,Patient,"Because. yeah my hands stress a lot, so I guess my body reacts to it. And then uncomfortable so like. How can you. How can you enjoy the process of learning if you're in pain does that make sense."
740.0,Provider,"yeah so that's that's i'm saying you may need to go ahead and make an appointment for orthopedic doctor. and easy that you can make the appointment, some people. Some people. may want you to get a referral, for your the primary your PCP or you could just make the appointment with that a referral it depends on where you go, but you should. make an appointment to see orthopedic doctor, so they can they can be able to help address the issue that you have with your hand. I mean handy shoes, I understand I had surgery on my wrist. So I definitely understand how it can be really painful I had surgery on one roof, and then I had the flare up in another room. So among so, but if you go to ortho ortho be able to leave let you know what it is, and then they can help you. kind of work through that you they may give you some exercises, they want to do, they may do X Ray they may give you a prescription I don't know that's not to do but it's best to go, so that you can figure out how you can get that resolved, and they can reduce your anxiety. i'm sure it will reduce your anxiety and once you know what it is."
