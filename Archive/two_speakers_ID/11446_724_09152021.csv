Or do I need to be off the hook for my surgery. So that's one reason why I don't want to do it by surgery. yeah I don't know what they're going to say test me so far. I just don't want to be on it. I mean it makes me feel good to tell you that."
11446.0,Patient,"Sure yeah I mean that's that's what mood altering substances, do you know they make us feel good for our bet and so it's it's looking at the negative consequences of it, though, that."

11446.0,Patient,"Well, and I think I think being able to keep your soda too, because if you don't you're going to crave it more and then you're just going to want to drink it even more than you'll probably drink even more than you do now. You like binge drink it, so I think finding ways to have your sodas throughout the day you know, even if it's you know, maybe, maybe, reducing the amount, but adding you know, adding some other things in between. Which is probably water, which would help you know that helps just to cleanse your organs and keep your bowels going functioning well and."
