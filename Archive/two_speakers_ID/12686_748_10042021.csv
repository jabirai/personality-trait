12686.0,Patient,"um I don't know I assume the Tara shared. Some notes with you, or something so I don't know exactly what you want me to catch you up on."
748.0,Provider,"You know she actually didn't share a lot i'm sure she was really busy, the only thing i've had is your that I that I did review is your history question near I really like getting to know people by just getting to know people so."
12686.0,Patient,All right.
748.0,Provider,And you can just start where you are so that you're not feeling like you have to backtrack lot.
12686.0,Patient,"yeah. Okay, so I guess my issue is the. i've been suffering from depression, for a while now i've had it for. My whole life, basically, at least, since you know i'm not sure remember. But um I got divorced in 2016 and since then i've been pretty much you know, having very serious issues. just trying to function your team focus. Okay, I haven't I haven't worked since then i'm currently living with. My mother after I was on my own for a couple years and then just a really bad and I needed to not be living by myself anymore. So. I also believe, or the probably had ADHD for. My whole life. i've always had problems with focus and attention, it was a gifted kid but you know it's like those the stereotype of like absent minded Professor right the. You know, things are supposed to be hard or easy for me in terms of like academic tasks and that kind of thing but. Just like maintaining the daily schedule and staying organized has always been very difficult for me so starting with bright heart like one of the things I wanted to do was not just. You know, get back on antidepressants but tried stimulants so i've been trying at all for a while and I have an appointment on the 20th with Sean towel to follow up. But i'm kind of struggling, because it is affecting my ability to sleep, I still got very little sleep last night just. Before talking to you. And I don't know if that's necessarily the meds themselves that are causing it or just the you know there's some things that are still like a trigger for me. muscle i'm still like getting kind of like upset about stuff on a regular basis, I don't know um."
748.0,Provider,"Can you. just heard about that, can you tell me what kinds of things are triggering you."
12686.0,Patient,"I don't know most of my social interactions are online and I guess, sometimes I have a reputation for sort of like going on rants or just like needing to get stuff out and I don't know last night or really literally yesterday, but then going into last night, for whatever reason. I don't know that's there's a whole complicated backstory not sure I did want to feel like but it's really getting into all of it, but just like. I hadn't seen anyone in a long time and in person versus dependent It started with someone that I knew was in town and I saw her on Saturday. And that one well, I think that happened, but I guess, I just want to know, I thought it kind of like exhausted and I had talked about some stuff with her that just kind of stirred up stuff in the past, well again my marriage. So just like yesterday, last night I was just like kind of on a tear about like just wanting to vent online about. i'm. About like how I feel. Like the reason that I got divorced was ultimately that we had very different ideas of what like. We wanted in life, you know, and I still have a lot of feelings about like I don't want. The traditional you know markers of success and I i've always felt kind of like pressured into. A certain life path by somebody to be my dad when I was younger and my wife later on in life. Well, I don't know like I was I had like sort of a repeated conversation with channel like I don't know if. it's healthy for me to. You know sort of like treat like. Like Twitter as therapy or whatever, just like you know, like. i'm telling them in front of a public audience, but their stuff I feel like I sometimes only really figure out in the process of having those conversations, like last night I just. You know I just and I was kind of reacting to something, but I did pretty much setting you know what, if I had my ideal why, if they would be like the sketchy guy who lives in a van right like what would what always like frustrated me was the. The. Lead it's natural for me to I really feel like it is natural for me to like get bored with a certain place get bored with a certain situation and want to move on, but I have that kind of like. wanderlust whatever you want to call it feeling when I was kind of judge that in myself as I mature right and then other people are judging me for it and. Like you know the mature thing to do is to be able to commit to something to put down roots right to have a plan for what you want to. build with your life and I just kind of feel like my marriage ended because I. I just kind of snap like I ended up like I was on that path, and I was in a much better position to do that, but a lot of people, but I just ran away from it. You know, and I think a big part of like one mulling over in my head, since then, I was like. trying to convince myself will argue with myself like whether I have the right to just decide hey that's how I want to live my life. If I want to like die, you know, whatever age and I never had a steady job and I never had kids. And you know I know it was never part of any like local community and i'm the guy who like wandered from place to place there's no nothing wrong with that lots of people have done that right and that's how I keep trying to tell myself that there's. there's definitely ways in which I feel like i'm not happy with my life, the way it is, and I wish you know I were more productive and more responsible but i'm trying to separate that from having a specific. goal or plan in mind for my wife, and you know, like, I really. Like I really just kind of like. One of the things that I was kind of like getting upset and dumb and I was like you know what I don't want to. I don't want to get married again like ever again it was a mistake to get married, the first time and I knew at the time right like not just marrying her I didn't want to get married I don't think i'm the kind of person who wants to be married right and the the at the time. People treat adele's like oh that's cold feet right like that's just a maturity and that's how everybody feels how on on them feel. When they're about to make a big commitment but you get over that right, you make you take the plunge and make the commitment you realize this is where you're supposed to be. and eventually you're happy and you, you can't imagine anything else, and that has never happened for me right, and I even said, like. You know, like the i'm always like i'm the kind of person where it's like i'm always arguing with myself in my head, so I already know that like. rebuttal you know before I even heard of zones, you know i've already gone through all the loops and everything, but like like you know. One of the point of getting divorced, it was like you know there's the voice in my head saying well you think that your life's going to be like you know you have this ideal life like you're 25. When you get divorced doesn't ever how it works out right it's like you're not going to get like a dozen like hot girlfriends. you're not going to be like partying every night, you know it's your life is going to be the same as it is now only are alone it's going to be worse right and I really like. At some point, I just gotten mad was like you know I don't care if I never date or have sex again in my life right, I would rather. Just be alone than be living in a life I don't want to live and i'd rather have nothing than have this and, like. i've always kind of felt like it wasn't like a double bind right like. we've ever had have arguments with my wife like I don't want this thing I don't want to move here I don't want to do this, I don't want it it's like those are like well, what do you want to do instead do you have a better option. Right and I was never I was always on the back foot when confronted with that I was, I have a very. Very good."
748.0,Provider,hey that isn't true you are.
12686.0,Patient,"Right i'm never good at making my own plans or deciding what I want to do. And i've always been kind of passively led around by somebody in my marriage was a lot like that right, like the line was a kid was like my dad. Making plans for me, I never learned it to like be the one in charge of you know there's like that stereotype like I wasn't a mature dude who needed a girlfriend or wife to like be the the like responsible ones and make plans right like ultimately was like. I don't have to know what I want to do instead you know I don't want to do this and, just like the most like extreme like. You know, like i'm not suicidal now right, but a lot of times you know, knowing that it's not like a rational thing right like it's it's not a good thing to want to kill yourself, but a lot of things. That almost feels like you know suicide is a cry for help right there's just something I would rather have nothing at all i'd rather be dead than do this because that's like the only way I can say, like no right like instead of like like that's a way to say no that's like. an ambiguous, as opposed to you know I just don't want to do this, I don't wanna I don't wanna I don't want this relationship, I don't want this job. and always hearing like well, what do you wanna do instead what you want to do instead, what do you want to do instead you know just like feeling so helpless about when when when."
748.0,Provider,"I was like you also feel powerless. yeah. In this culture yeah well with what the expectations are because I hear so many expectations that that sort of run you're thinking well if I don't do this, then I should do this people tell me, no one would you mind if I got up and close that door my dog opened my door. Okay, I I really apologize. I just want to make sure that it feels like we have the privacy and. And the space and because I want to honor your To me, this is a very sacred communication, so what i'm really hearing is that one of the things that really runs you and runs. runs a lot of the internal dialogue is should should should should. And those should are coming from. Cultural expectations and maybe, at least, it seems like something that that your dad used to say to you, things that your dad used to say to you, and then that got. repeated by your ex wife that you found somebody else who, who is. who lives by a lot of expectation. And so I don't know that I really hear what you do want other than to be separate from this very rigid structured cultural. norm that everybody's supposed to adhere to and you don't want to."
12686.0,Patient,"yeah and i'm when I say stuff like i'd like to wander the country living in a van right like I don't I don't know if I seriously want that because I intellectually like I know like that's a rough lifestyle. Most people could try it on there was a woman who you know, was a damn life blogger, who was like murdered recently right and so yeah I know there's um. But you know, like sometimes it feels like I only ever get to like what do you want when i'm not like these moments of. emotional extremity like. My my last fights with my ex wife like are really the last fight like just said, like what do you what don't you have. That you want right, what is it that you don't have because we have so much there's you know there's so much privilege right like really like whoa. You know she was very agree right like I do all these things for you, for you, what do you not have that you want, and I just I like freedom. I want to be able to walk away, you know I would I would I wouldn't give all of the stuff up and I did I did like my walk away from a divorce it's like almost no like physical possessions, I give up all the stuff to just like be able to walk away and have nothing holding me back and."
748.0,Provider,make you happy.
12686.0,Patient,"I don't know. I felt a lot of guilt about that right because that's really not a thing that in and of itself that you have right it's still a negative it's a lack of something I don't know. When I when I first like the first week after the divorce, I thought, like, I was trying to like keep my spirits up like now, I can do anything I want right, and then I couldn't think of anything that I wanted to do and I guess that's when the depression came in, but."
748.0,Provider,"perfect description of depression. yeah now, if anything, I can do anything I want and there's nothing that I want to do."
12686.0,Patient,"That I mean. Oh, I mean. When I want to try to tell people why the divorce happened. It was the year 2016 felt like a lot of things, just like in the country and everything. Wrong wrong. fault like really threatened and scared. And I think we just had opposite reactions to that and her reaction to it, which was already common was like. um because I feel threatened and scared I need to have certainty in my life right, I need to like. put down roots, I need to have something I can all feel like I always fall back to the always be there, so don't want to join us to own a house to buy a house in cash right, so no matter what. will always have the House. She wanted to get well, we were married, but she wanted to like you know really start a family and make it serious right have kids. And I don't know I just feel like my response to feeling under stressor in danger is the exact opposite right like I said, like if i'm in danger. than I need to i'm always looking for the exit was looking for the way out, I feel safe when I feel like I can run away not stand my ground right like that's my safety is like the only can jump in the car and drive off and disappear somewhere and. I mean I don't know I still kind of feel that way right like that's not. that's not really how I live my life and i'm like aware that it takes a lot of. effort to like really realistically be able to do that. But, just like you know the the big thing like you know what fear of commitment I keep saying like. If I wanted to like to say, like what's your weakness what's your problem, like the the the shortest way to say is like fear of commitment right well, the reason I don't have a job right now is like I. I think about like trying to commit to some like plan for my career at this point, and I just sort of started getting like anxiety, just like thinking about it about having to make a choice you know. And yet, like you know. Like I I think of it as a bad thing and yeah like it's it's like like fighting for the right to not have to commit to anything was like I gave up like everything for the that freedom, you know I still value it, I still like. You know, like that's like maybe it's a stream thing, but like that's why I got so mad like saying you know what who the hell else is businesses if i'm a bomb who lives in a van for the rest of my life right like like who gets to tell me that i'm supposed to do. If I had something to prove before then, I think I actually proved it, because when I left, and I was the one. Who ended up, who is who's responsible for entering the marriage and she and I would both agree that on that right, the one I left, I had a house. I had a steady income, I was like a lot better off than a lot of my friends, it was legalism that's what she was saying was like we were in the perfect position to like really commit and start a family and I like. You know I burned every bridge I like through all of that away as permanently as I could because I just didn't want it. And like if I, I have no idea if I have such a hard time with introspection and with like knowing what I want just by thinking about it than that I feel like you know I can only say what I want based on looking at my actions when push comes to shove, what I do and what I do. Is I don't want to commit I want to be able to just walk away, I wanted to like. I said, like in my ideal life, you know I make a new set of friends every two years right I think upstages from somewhere else, and I started playing with a blank slate and that's like my. that's what I actually want like that feels good to me it feels a mature right like that's supposed to be like."
748.0,Provider,"Labels it in mature but but going back, I mean I I don't think you labeled that in mature that sounds like what you want, but I also go back to what's curious what i'm curious about is. Why, what is it about relationships that last longer than you're using the. Designation two years, what about that isn't appealing to you, having someone in your life that has known you for. A decade and and is there for you and cares about what's going on for you and you feel the same, what do you what does not appeal about that let's find out what does."
12686.0,Patient,"No, no. No that's interesting. Because one I got divorced from eliza one of the next things that I did I didn't do right away, but eventually I did was I just like went through all of our mutual friends. on social media and I just blocked all of them, and I was like saying it stresses me at the time when I said and I sent them a mass email at this time, just like saying you know, this is not personal and. I don't want it to be taken as personal or like as an attack or whatever is like my opinion of you, but I just I do not want any further connection. To my ex I want to cut off my social graph from her just like thinking about it and being your that situation is, you know I cannot handle that right, and that was how I justified it to myself at the time. But since then, you know, one of those people had been my best friend right and I actually got like a go between. US and someone's like Greg is really broken up that you decided to stop talking to him. And he really wishes you would reach out, and you know he doesn't know he doesn't understand why. You assume that he would take her side and the divorce, because he was always much closer to you, than to her and I felt bad, but I never even once really considered actually reconnecting with him or anyone else, and I really. I really feel like looking back like it wasn't just that it was like I want to be free of this whole social context, I was in I wanted to like I want to drop. All because because it was so intimately tied up. You know, like we were the couple that a lot of people like you know, like like you're looked up to, or whatever identity was so tied up with, just like in general, like having the having a past a history feels like such a burden, you know and. I guess, when you say like you know right like like I keep saying it's the mature or it's bad right like like i'm projecting right, but like I was raised in. A culture not just that you know my parents are in Chinese immigrants and everything so that's one thing, but also other reason very conservative Christian culture right with a lot of like ideas about maturity and accountability and almost like I think this. This thing, where I go like picking fights online or something is like you know I have those voices in my head and I need someone to like. stand in for those voices, so I can like argue with them or yell at them, but like you know, like like there's a lot of people who say well that's you know it's not healthy. to want to start over again right or is it to like he people at arm's length that way that makes me not trust you like, you must be like a abusive or dangerous person, because you know if if if you don't want people to like have. If you don't want to history with people you want to keep on starting over with people that must mean you're leaving a bad impression right. And and and I don't know, maybe."
748.0,Provider,you're leaving a bad impression. I just didn't want to leave the relationship.
12686.0,Patient,"I just don't want that. burden of I don't know i'm like I watched a movie randomly I don't know most of the movie isn't that relevant but there's just like you know it's a movie about a girl going back to her hometown. For thanksgiving after going to college right and she just sees all our old friends and she says like I wish I didn't have to know so many things about all these people. Because I don't care. Right I wish I didn't have to look at her and know what happened to her in fourth grade and know that she hates him and the you know, is he dated her for low right like like the burden of being in that context of being in a Community quote unquote right like. I don't know like to me that's. that's just. it's painful it's a kind of. I don't like feeling. The responsibility that comes with that you know."
748.0,Provider,"that's that makes up Okay, so it sounds to me as though, one of the things you're describing is. hello, I want to say this, it feels like you're telling me about why you don't want to live up to other people's not just expectations but definition of the way that life is supposed to be. But what I really am starting to hear is that emotional. The the experience of connecting to others, and knowing all of their really their. Challenges and realities. It it's a huge wait for you, because you feel it so deeply. You carry a lot of people with you and and. And you feel it all the time, even though, because you are. I don't know if I can describe this well, but I get the sense that what's going on inside of you behind this wall. Is all emotional turmoil, but what you talk about sounds very intellectual it sounds very. thoroughly thought out and and it's based on parameters and beliefs and does that make sense. yeah yeah. So what people here is your belief system but that's not really going on its internal pain. And that internal pain gets weighted even more heavily because of. The fact that the more people that you're exposed to an experience the heavier the way it is because you feel all of it."
12686.0,Patient,yeah. I make sense.
748.0,Provider,and your pain is enough for. You that's all you want to have to deal.
12686.0,Patient,"yeah I mean. Okay, I guess. I guess, when you say that. Okay, so I guess i'll be i'll be candid about something I didn't tell her about, but one thing that's been. going on with me and that i've you know kind of tried to downplay in my own mind, because I don't I don't want it to be a big deal has I don't I still don't think I would seriously do it, but. You know, at some point, you know, I was just talking with people online and. It was like some of those abstract like you know political thing which is like saying like you know I don't see. what's morally wrong about sex work right if it's consensual and everyone's treated well. And I don't see why it would give me something to judge and then suddenly it was just like you know the seed planted in my head and I actually started like. Going online and researching and looking up like directories for sports and stuff and I was like you know, like like actually like. Like making a list of like someone, I would like to contact with I feel okay about this now do I have the money to afford this and, just like mulling it over in my head and like sort of almost like being like addicted to the sides i've never done i've never done it right and um."
748.0,Provider,"Are you talking i'm sorry to interrupt you, but I want to be clear, so are you talking about becoming a sex."
12686.0,Patient,"Work, no, no, no i'm talking about hiring."
748.0,Provider,A sex worker. yeah okay.
12686.0,Patient,"I you know I think this is something else those words came out last night, like like I didn't you know I I didn't I didn't come clean about that anybody, but like. Just like saying you know. There were there were other people like shining in just being like. You know at this age right like I know someone like a lot older than me I don't feel like ever getting married again and i'm fine with saying that the fun part. Of dating, which is the value of the early part of the shallow part is all i'm interested in right like going out. dancing seeing movies, you know hooking up but I don't need a partner, I want a partner right, and you know at the age of like whatever like 55 or something I think i'm old enough to finally say that. Without like self consciousness like say that and I almost feel like. Like that was like a lightbulb moment from is like what's the fantasy here really like, is it really has you know the risks and everything and you just you know, whenever i'm in love with feel I do like feel. Like bad about it right like like like with my upbringing animals feel like it would it would be mostly like a rebellion against the morality, I was raised with right but. But at the same time it's also like what I feel like I really no I want is like I want. To go out with a girl, I want to have not even like the sex part I just want to go out with a girl and enjoy girls company and no there's no possibility. of going further than that, like just like absolutely know for a fact there's no like marriage material discussion others know like escalator taking you optimally the next you know."
748.0,Provider,"there's not even let's not even talk about marriage there's, not even a second date. Right, I mean you could choose to see that same person again but it wouldn't be a date. A transaction. Right yeah yeah. And, and you know what I what i'm hearing you tell me is yes, it would be about the physical side of things, because that's what you're paying for but more accurately it's about having connection that has a very concrete, tangible beginning intent."
12686.0,Patient,Right.
748.0,Provider,"So that you're not having to take on their energy and I don't know if that word makes sense to you, but because you're carrying so much now i'm not making a comment about the rest of it, because ultimately that's up to you, I do of course want to at least include. The truth of it, which is, it is important to notice, whether or not that's the propensity toward another addictive behavior. right which is. But that's something you have to look at and own and and I don't know I don't know you get to know whether that's whether that's a pitfall in your life, whether addiction is a big deal in your life. Actually. But I I hear it, I guess, one of the words that I haven't set out loud yet and i'm starting to hear is there's you you you present very. Very rationally very thoughtfully you've thought through a lot of things you're obviously brilliant your IV you use the word gifted you're obviously very, very intelligent, but what i'm really hearing is a very quiet rebel. And i'm guessing that rebellion wasn't allowed in your life."
12686.0,Patient,"I was. So I guess yeah. Like big thing. About like the elephant in the room is that my childhood was really. abusive with my dad and i'm still like. Still really not okay over it, I have like a minor like bureaucratic thing to take care of like his name is still on some of the bills getting paid in this House, and he doesn't live here anymore has been divorced from my mom for like 20 years now. And I need his help I just I just need to call them and tell them, you need to I need your consent to get your name off of these things right for both of our sakes right but I haven't done it yet, because I just don't want to talk to them, but. ya know it was really bad it was physical when I was a kid like I my arm he broke my arm, when I was like 10 years old. that's that's like almost like a. that's like the most like that's the biggest thing that happened, it was almost like. And I almost just want to lead with that because I just want to like make it like on ambiguous almost feel like I have to like defend myself like that that happened, and that was like characteristic of the things that happened, you know. And so yeah no I still have a lot of resentment, just like you know. He was my template for authority growing up, I have a hard time not hearing as wasn't a recent one so Whenever someone tells me what you shorter shorter than or can or can't do you know. And for him, it was really tied up in like you know I don't I don't want you to waste your life I don't want to waste waste your potential. I feel like like literally saying like you know, like, I feel like i'm doing my duty to you as a father, I would not be doing my duty to if I let you. Be lazy and screw up your life, like all these other kids right like I feel like I have to like push you to like achieve the success that you're capable of, and I really screwed me up you know i'm."
748.0,Provider,Still rebelling against him being living in your head.
12686.0,Patient,"yeah I mean this was actually another thing that happened online as like. A like an insight that happened because someone else at something, but just like. On those viral tweet right like like everyone was mad at because everyone was kind of trolling, but they were like. This is like the person was like so you're always complaining about your parents wiping your ass when you were little, but you graduated from college didn't you right and I was like you wonder why some people seem to sabotage themselves all the time. When there are people who will say to their face that any success on their part. Is validation for their abuser right and that wasn't something that clicked for me until I said it, but soon, as I said, I was like oh yeah I was like oh my God like and I know. That, if I give her ever give him like a good news about my life or things are looking up about my life like he's going to take it as well, then I did a good job than I, but I I did that I did what I supposed to do and. So."
748.0,Provider,you're not achieving. Any of your own dreams is about punishing him.
12686.0,Patient,"So when it's done, maybe, no."
748.0,Provider,"And it really reminds me of a. That I like very much about resentment or. Well resentment is really the best word to describe it, that it's like we drink poison hoping that it will kill that other person. And so, the reality is that you don't get any joy. Because he's still living in your head. We need to have him amputated from your brain. Because you deserve to have a life that you want. None other than spending your life punishing him for what he did, to you, and the reason is. We live in a culture in a well this isn't necessarily fair but but it feels this way to us when it's going on that doesn't that doesn't take seriously that damage that apparent can do that you're describing so explicitly and so beautifully through your pain. So it's up to you know I will use another line that I like, which is the best revenge is happiness. So let's make our work together about how to make you happy. Rather than how to prove him."
12686.0,Patient,wrong.
748.0,Provider,"Now what i'm gonna see, I just want to make sure oh could still got 20 minutes. What I would I would really, really like to do is put some attention on. Creating an idea of things that would make you happy things that would make your life work better, if he had nothing to do with your life. And kind of talking and better does if he has no interaction in your life doesn't sound like you have to interact with them. No okay. i'm what i'm really wondering about as a concrete step toward, that is what other ways what other avenues might be open to you for getting him off of things that come to your House, or have something to do with bills and it sounds like bills, is that right."
12686.0,Patient,"yeah, and I mean it's you know it's self defeating because the biggest thing I can do is to. Just make that phone call."
748.0,Provider,Well i'm.
12686.0,Patient,"get him to go. I talked to the company before and they said, we can remove the primary account holders name without their consent right so it's a one time thing that I have to do you know but."
748.0,Provider,that's someone else who could do it.
12686.0,Patient,Now I don't want to make my mom do it because.
748.0,Provider,You are.
12686.0,Patient,yeah yeah it was worse than with me so.
748.0,Provider,i'm does your mom have an attorney for the divorce.
12686.0,Patient,"And the horses, a long time ago, so I don't know she's she doesn't have like an attorney like that she's in contact with but. it's, not that I keep selling myself it's not that big a deal right it's just one."
748.0,Provider,"is a big deal. Okay let's stop telling yourself that because it actually is a big deal because the person who feels like they have to contact your father is the 10 year old with the broken. And that's painful and that's scary and that's a feeling of i'm going to contact this person who's going to abuse. So. don't diminish the fear that that part inside of you has. And and and I know that you don't have people close to you right now, because there has been a lot of cutting of ties Is there anyone you feel connected to online."
12686.0,Patient,"yeah there's there are, in fact, a few people. yeah."
748.0,Provider,"Things that come to mind one is if you're if you feel connected someone online you could you could open a chat with them or. You know message APP or something while you contact your father, you could also contact your father, while we're in this session."
12686.0,Patient,Setting. yeah. let's not.
748.0,Provider,Do it alone. Do you know anything about his schedule Do you know anything about when the best time would be.
12686.0,Patient,"I don't know he's retired, so I think there's no particular time."
748.0,Provider,"Okay, good."
12686.0,Patient,"um but. yeah I mean it's, not that I haven't talked to him before it's just that, after a long period of not doing it just you know feels harder to start up a conversation with him."
748.0,Provider,feel unsafe.
12686.0,Patient,"Not in that way um I don't feel like i'm. I don't feel like i'm triggered in that way, like i'm not afraid of him right like i'm a lot bigger than him now and i'm not that the good guy you know but. No it's just that I just I them, I feel bad for talking to him, you know. Just feels like. I know it just it feels like my my dignity, has been insulted by having to be like. To pretend to be like friendly to somebody you know because he doesn't even acknowledge that he did nothing wrong, and I know like with my mom. i've heard her talk about like how. How painful, that is to like just like pretend that things are okay, with him, because he just kind of like. edits history, so that nothing bad happened right. I don't know. But yeah i'm. that's important yeah."
748.0,Provider,The edits history.
12686.0,Patient,"it's your life yeah. No i'm. I mean, even just like. I feel like I have like this rift with not so much my I have a younger sister my younger brother. my sister it's four years younger than me and my brothers, he was older than these were four years apart, and I feel like I have much more of a rift with my brother just because his experience of growing up with my dad was so different from mine like even if. Intellectually he knows sort of what happened, he doesn't feel the same way about my dad that I do you know. and"
748.0,Provider,I are already gone.
12686.0,Patient,Sorry.
748.0,Provider,Had he had had your dad gotten tired and less attacking with your younger brother or was he already gone.
12686.0,Patient,"I feel like he just didn't. He didn't he didn't care as much it was like I was the firstborn. yeah so i'm ready to start with that, but also like my brother is smart, but I was like a genius or whatever, and I was a kid. And he put all this like importance on. On that all his hopes on that you know, and he didn't care as much about what happened with my younger brother and I guess he's sort of like learned to pick his battles or something. But sometimes I just go and I look at my younger brothers life, and I know he's had his own struggles, but you know he's he's like pulling six figures he's a. Pro software engineer, you know, he did everything right right and like partly that's his personality that he is more like my dad or like, at least in terms of like the things that they value, you know. But also, I just like he didn't have my experiences so I know he thinks that a lot of my like my emotional stuff he doesn't get it right like I like that whole like drinking poison despite someone else kind of thing, but he hasn't been through it. So it's just very hard for me to like you know talk about it with someone who doesn't. feel the same way, I was like well i've tried to like like analyze like what would the rational thing. To do in this situation and, like none of nothing i've done for the past few years has been rational right just from like like the cost benefit analysis right like. There was always possible for me not to end up here, there are always things I could have done, you know I decided in a certain sense to end up here and I can't particularly why right but."
748.0,Provider,"let's say your brother your brother only sees it, that result results of. The pain and and therefore judges, it is your choice of behavior rather than. No experience of what you've walked through."
12686.0,Patient,"No emotion I don't know everything that he's been through session judge too harshly, but it feels like that sometimes."
748.0,Provider,"Well, and. yeah yeah I mean we we can't really know what another person's in our experiences unless they become very fluent in talking about their inner experience and our culture is is committed to us not doing that so most of us don't learn how. And, and so often what happens is our our lives become our story. Because we don't have the language to speak it."
12686.0,Patient,and
748.0,Provider,And you've made a commitment to learning that language. Because of the pain before. The work that you're doing right now is all about them. And that takes a lot of courage. I don't know if you give yourself credit with them. yeah absolutely. What is what is your situation with your sister.
12686.0,Patient,"she's kind of like the peacemaker in our family. Which is kind of like stereotypical because she's the only daughter and she's the middle child. But you know I feel like i'm on i'm on better terms with her than the rest of my family I can't really. Talk to my mom we don't have much in common, we don't even really speak the same language like literally her original her language is Chinese and she doesn't speak English very well and I don't speak Chinese very well and there's there's a cultural as well as language barrier. But I don't know my sister is going through a lot herself, she has a chronic illness, she is you know engaged and she has a lot of like there's a lot of backstory with her and her fiance. Now that she's just the only with a lot. So I don't really feel like burning her. And she lives across the country calm, but. I know she is one of the few people I really do feel like I could. Like turn to if I had to but it's just hard for me to do that."
748.0,Provider,"Well, and right now is not the right time because. What you've worked to do what it feels as though you spend a lot of your time defending what the way that you've chosen to take care of yourself. it's evolved the pain when, in reality, if you take a step back and look you've done a wonderful job of protecting yourself from from more pain bombarding but then there's this inner argument about because people don't. approve of the way that you've done. Your whole life becomes arguing about why you've done it. What the next step would be for you to move forward now that you've created this insulated world. You you've made it not possible for people to intrude on your your experience. Like that already. So what it feels like is now we can start to work on what is going on inside. What is it that would be. helpful in healing for. The word I want sort of surgically removing your father from your inner experience. Right and that's really where the work is. we've got to do some surgery essentially to amputate him from your break. And, and we never do that we it's never possible, but you can transform that relationship and become the protector of that young and i'm sure it started long before you were 10. Long before you return i'm sure you are identified as a genius probably first grade. Right. Now, so the expectations of who you should be, and you know, I have a friend who used to talk about. The way that his mother. treated him was as if you were a bonsai tree. just be a little clip here and then you'd be okay, and a little clip here and then you'd be okay, but the constant message was you're not okay. And it and your punishment for that for now I don't know what your dad's expectation was when you were a little boy. But i'm guessing it wasn't to be playful and fun and enjoy your childhood. So that's The other thing is, you have to have a childhood. No matter what your birth certificate says your ages you've got to play. I have a feeling that that's part of the sex worker thing. yeah no ties no responsibility, I just get to go play. And it's adults that's a that's an arena that feels playful. So I don't know if any of this is helpful, but what it is, for me, is it's i'm really getting to know you."
12686.0,Patient,Thank you yeah it is helpful actually.
748.0,Provider,"I just want to, because we are getting close to the end of the session, I just want to tell you how unbelievably honored I am that you would open up to me like you have."
12686.0,Patient,In the.
748.0,Provider,first session I just feel really privileged and really sad. about all that you've walked through and words let you.
12686.0,Patient,Okay.
748.0,Provider,"And what i'm committed to is what you said at the very beginning of our session, you really wanted, but all our labeling which is freedom. You don't need freedom from. Having a life that you might want whether that includes work or or friendships or connection, you need freedom from the pain. I. So I talked too much, and I knows that."
12686.0,Patient,But no that's Thank you that's helpful.
748.0,Provider,And thank you for showing up is there anything you'd like to share. For the end toward the end of our session anything further.
12686.0,Patient,"On and there's a lot of other stuff to go into but that i'd rather go into with the time to really go into it, but now, this has been better than I thought verse session would be so thank you."
748.0,Provider,"And like I said it's my privilege to be with you and. Would you like to set a goal for now, between now and your next session. If you would like to set a goal, something that comes to mind is not necessarily doing in but identifying what you need to be able to feel supported to move forward on one of the things that feels the most important from the session getting your father out of your House. So not doing it it's not like well just do that you know pull yourself up by your bootstraps that you don't need that know what do you need internally to support you to make that phone. let's have that be the goal that you try to. sort of ruminate and think about and think of that young part of you, what does he need to feel safe enough to make that call."
12686.0,Patient,know.
748.0,Provider,That feel like a goal that would be worth working on.
12686.0,Patient,yeah. Thank you.
748.0,Provider,"Absolutely, and we can talk about that and group to move to with it feel safe enough if you have an idea that comes up when you check in. Okay we'll wait till the next session."
12686.0,Patient,"Thank you um do we need to schedule, make a schedule for the next appointment or."
748.0,Provider,"um you know I because i'm so new i'm not sure if I can do that I, I imagine it and i'm delighted to do it when would you like to meet again."
12686.0,Patient,We just do it recurring Monday my name. Because that's easy as it.
748.0,Provider,sounds like you plan to me and i'll reach out to the scheduling team and and let them know that that's our plan.
12686.0,Patient,"So that you don't. All right, thank you so much."
748.0,Provider,"Oh it's been an honor Thank you again for failing, for I hope feeling safe enough that you could be so open."
12686.0,Patient,i'll see you tomorrow.
748.0,Provider,Absolutely take good care of you.
