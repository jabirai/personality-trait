14727.0,Patient,"Man i'm i'm all right i'm I mean I keep I don't know I just got my son back from the airport and stuff this weekend and drop them off at the dorms and stuff so it's like even making my. whole thing was applying for the master's program stuff more real and I had to do a zoom meeting for that just before this and I don't know i'm just kind of I know I can do it, but i'm scared either way with our don't get in when they're good to get in it's fairly yeah yeah."
298.0,Provider,It took. The fourth time me applying for a master's program for my specialty of of mental health for me to get in and by the fourth time when they accepted me in it seems so surreal like like are you sure that I was just a crazy.
14727.0,Patient,yeah and that's it I didn't realize it it starts to summer session I mean I thought I had to fall asleep like do get accepted and I found out know if there's a summer session that's the first session and.
298.0,Provider,"refresh my memory, what is that you're going in for."
14727.0,Patient,My social work. gotcha Emily.
298.0,Provider,badly needed to.
14727.0,Patient,"yeah and it's the advanced standing program too so because I have a 4.04 my bachelor's degree I qualify for the advanced standing which it's two years online, it could be, one year on campus, but I have a little and so. Online is much more suitable for me."
298.0,Provider,"Oh, I hear you much, much better. Here today."
14727.0,Patient,"I was gonna talk to you about well a couple of things i've been not working with my therapist and even my doctor I talked about them with like my. Problems I mean with the ADHD stuff that and my therapist was like i'm not sure and and we were talking in the last like month and a half and she's like you know what you might be right. You do. Show ADHD symptoms and stuff so that's something that maybe in the future, we might be able to try to start to work to address. know how."
298.0,Provider,"yeah because you're inside and so high, and your benzodiazepines are so high that the problem we run into is you're you're basically. it's not good to mix stimulants and benzodiazepines it's an upper and a downer."
14727.0,Patient,yeah.
298.0,Provider,You wouldn't like the feeling that it would give you for your mood.
14727.0,Patient,"and see that my my doctor suggested which i'm trying to wait for is they actually have an http group she referred me to some kind of wait for the referral for that. Okay cuz I really work on that. But My other concern was to see I don't mean like I know that I took my pen before and then two milligrams that four times a day and it worked well for me it works better, for me, than the xanax does. But I don't know if that is something that would be possible."
298.0,Provider,Not at that dosage not at six milligrams.
14727.0,Patient,All this actually eight milligrams a day it was for today.
298.0,Provider,"yeah okay I I wouldn't be willing to do that, you might be able to find somebody else who might be you're at my talk to some the xanax and it would cross over to klonopin the same four milligrams if you wanted to do it that way. And then I could always give you a referral out, you might be able to find somebody else who was willing i'm not i'm not i'm just trying to say I don't want to lose you, but at the same time, I know you need to take care of you."
14727.0,Patient,"Great well, I mean right now i've been i'm I just I want everything to be stable before school starts is what i'm looking for. And if I can actually my my doctor even told me that she would be willing to take over prescribing the benzodiazepines and my other stuff once I get into the ADHD group. But I have. To wait for that referral so at this point, I mean if we can keep the xanax where it is, and maybe that might be the best thing for me."
298.0,Provider,Maybe what about switching like the nighttime dose or a quantum pen and using the xanax in the daytime.
14727.0,Patient,"And i'm not even sure how that would work, what does that mean."
298.0,Provider,"We you take so you right now, you get two milligrams twice a day of Santa What if you did too many milligrams of xanax for one of your doses and two milligrams of klonopin for another dose."
14727.0,Patient,i'm.
298.0,Provider,just leaving it the way it is.
14727.0,Patient,"To maybe we should maybe i'll just leave it the way it is right now and try to figure out with my doctor and see. How to move forward with that, and I mean she has you guys all have access to my therapist to because i've signed our allies and everything so. um and I need to actually make an appointment with my doctor anyhow, because I have to get a referral for. cardiac MRI anyhow so and that's Another thing I need to make sure that my stresses and anxieties are lower, because if I don't. That can actually pause my heart have more issues and yeah so that's really, really, really working to try to get everything figured out and under control, especially before I start the master's program so."
298.0,Provider,"Well, that makes complete sense."
14727.0,Patient,"yeah because I mean i'm going to be adding more stress doing that, so I really need to make sure that I feel comfortable before I jump in with both feet, but i'm not going to be mentally able to handle it. So physically to so. Right yeah and like what I got did a stress test, and she said that she's not sure what she's seeing my heart is actually what she's seen because she couldn't see a clear enough on the sonogram. And you said it doesn't make sense, my age for what she thought she received and i'm like okay so she said I don't want to even talk to you about it until. You know you get the cardiac MRI which can be a couple more months out anyway so she said just manage your stress and anxiety and try to keep it as low as you can."
298.0,Provider,And that's.
14727.0,Patient,What i'm trying to do.
298.0,Provider,"Okay, well, we don't need to be making MED changes or. Increasing your stress."
14727.0,Patient,Right.
298.0,Provider,"Sorry. Is there anything else, I can help you with."
14727.0,Patient,I just I just thought it might be good to touch bases with.
298.0,Provider,"You, I know that you know what's going on with everything."
14727.0,Patient,"And I know it's because my household is slowed down, you know I mean I don't have. My grandkids that i'm caring for and my you know my daughter that i'm caring for and my you know my oldest son than me, you know why it's just me and my husband and my younger sitting behind me with his headphones on watching videos right now. So I mean it's calmed down where you know my responsibility for like people has lessened. Which is the only reason i'm even entertaining the idea of trying school. So yeah. it's it's much more calm environment. calmer environment leads to a little less chaos for me."
298.0,Provider,"That was true. All right, well, thank you for calling i'll talk to you later."
14727.0,Patient,"All right, thank you and then we'll just do this still through the group Fridays right. Okay, so see you Friday."
