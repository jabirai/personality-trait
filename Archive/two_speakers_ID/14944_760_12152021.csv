Like for this appointment because I had two appointments I can't I though it might have been Dominique and you, at the same time I don't remember I. sent me. yeah Okay, I was.

760.0,Provider,"Okay, so have you been."
14944.0,Patient,"i've been doing really well i've had some like a little bit of change happened here recently. My husband is, I think I talked to you about him a little bit he has well, he was really ill and I don't know I don't know if I really focused on that anyways he was really ill, because he has alcoholism and he was with someone that is really not. A healthy person like she's really abusive and like a lot and so he kind of he made the decision to leave there and so he's come home."
760.0,Provider,and
14944.0,Patient,"yeah we're going to be working together to because he wants to be I don't know he wants to come home or be here and. that's what our kids want and we've decided that we're going to try we're not going to guarantee anything because. You know I don't know what I know that I love him and I know that I want the best for all our kids and everything, but you can't really you know you just have to play it by ear kind of thing."
760.0,Provider,Is he still actively drinking my Dell.
14944.0,Patient,"um yeah he's detoxing currently and he actually needs to enroll in this program right now he's doing way better than. When I say abusive with the relationship that he was in the lady set a fire underneath the bed i'm trying to like burden like while he was sleeping like she he is like sores all over him he. I know she's burning all this stuff in the fireplace she burned all my he said she was going to burn my kid does stuff like she's actually like I don't know if you heard of the show deadly women she's like really a crazy person. Okay, and I kind of like he tried to call he's tried to come home before the last time he was ill he wanted to stay, but I had my my boyfriend see my ex boyfriend and her a lot of light like they like he abused me. And i'm with domestic violence and he's in jail and like I don't know they're almost the same person, but she's a little bit crazier. than he was but same day same thing, but anyways he didn't stay because I let he asked me to ask him to go, because he was here during abuse any solid the guy was doing to me and I let my abuser back end, and so my husband left you know until. I don't know i've been. Thinking about it for a long time, and like. Really it's my kids. could just switch honestly but they're you know we have to do it in a process like he has to get better and he wants to do that, like it's not me forcing him to do sobriety like he actually has. liver he's 32 and is livers. Completely pickled and his kidneys. Oh it's not going to be easy road but I don't know."
760.0,Provider,As he has he detox medically.
14944.0,Patient,"um he. I would have preferred that but he's honestly he's already, the last time he was ill he had to cut back, he was drinking a gallon I think a day I think that's what he was doing and now he's down to where. He drinks. Just when the like shakes Come on, and I got guys drinking water and he's a far better off than the last time he had come here and so right now yeah he's a doctor's appointment today or tomorrow, and if he was in. Okay, God. yeah I was going to request pots, I mean I was going to see if the doctor wanted hospitalization possibly but he actually came he spoke through. A lot better than i'm really surprised like he has the will to you know our kids because we're the kids are there with um they're not in our custody they're in what do you call it there's like CPS like the. I don't know when the Court has custody over. them there and that it. Should the system, so my mom has them she lives next door."

I you know it could like the lady was saying, like you know you can't afford to take any setbacks, you know, like because. of his issues and the thing is is like I told him and i've proved it like throughout this process that nothing will take me backwards, no matter what like I will keep going. And, if anything, I have to do what's best for the kids so he knows that. doing what is best for them, and I, I have no problem in ever asking anyone to go ever again."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, all right yeah."
14944.0,Patient,"That would be before they got home, he has to actually. You know, get on he's on the first steps of it and. we'll see how it goes but we're you know we're on that level we're separate entities, like my journey is going to continue on, and if we if they cross paths we do it together, you know that's great but i'll never stopped going because race and Lucy are babies."

Wait yeah because I don't find like focusing on like I tend to like want to help people like I I tend to want to be like you know here I. I can see the golden you, you know, instead of like going Okay, well, I see like good, but like looking at this to and. You know, you can always take this on every time like you can always help people because they have to. You know, they have to help themselves, and some people are just going to try and drag you down like you know they're gonna sit on you like you're there like floaty device, and like they'll get better and then you go down. i'm realizing that like as I go along, so you like go a. long way on that already."

14944.0,Patient,"Yes, I have. A boundary. there's no more i've given everybody that I know have enough chances and I. don't need to do that anymore, because if they want to do it they'll do it and they'll do it for themselves and they will I mean he'll do it for our children and himself and if he wants his family and if he doesn't then he won't and I will keep moving on."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, all right so. So you want to have healthy relationships and you want to set boundaries. continue to set boundaries."

Florida has a bit of control, right now, because. she's the caretaker of your kids, at least for now so."
14944.0,Patient,yeah for now. And she tries to that with me like i've had therapy like just seemed like it was based on just her my relationship because it's just so. dysfunctional the way we communicate she drove me nuts.
760.0,Provider,Okay.
14944.0,Patient,"yeah she's a much better grandmother than mother that she's a good mother, he always how do I need a but she can't emotionally mentally I just it's not there for us so. You know, sometimes there are out because I do have anger and like things and like I feel like I used to have more outbursts on her. I went from pleasing her all the time when my husband I were married like our marriage like I would always. Say i'm sorry, and I would never take give her blame for anything i'd be like okay me i'm sorry i'm i'm sorry mom because she would stop talking to me and i'd be like oh I don't like it. Now I turn that around and she doesn't like that she likes that other relationship, but so now it's I do everything wrong she does nothing wrong and. She doesn't like to be told anything, or if I bring it up, even in a nice way she goes I don't want to hear it get out of my car she wants no feedback there it's not really healthy to be like that, but. um so I started I leave her house I, although I can't do this all on the phone it's like I gotta get I have to there's a point where I know I gotta hang up or not answer again."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so you, you have to give yourself space when the."
14944.0,Patient,"Car with her, like, I have to work on, because I still do sometimes I like like i'm freaking out like when we're in the car ride to. it's hard to because she helps me oh like you know i'm like, but sometimes I feel like she's doing it so she can be like Okay, well, I did this for you and Look how you're like to show me something like. um but the car rides are hard, because I get a migraine and we've gotten down to the point where she's like get out or like i'm not getting up. feel pull over yeah."

14944.0,Patient,"Stay clean yeah yep um I don't the methamphetamine i've only used it the last year, so i've got 32 years of life without it, so it really was. um you know it, I like being really thin like I like being really thin and I help with my add and I didn't get a high mentally but I really don't. There is no methamphetamine and children and happy life and I like to being them I like I love being a mom and. I want to be happy and that stuff like i'm learning to be happy with myself that's another thing is my self image is a big thing of my life when I do get depressed it's usually because I don't feel good about myself, no matter what I do."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so we can work on self esteem."
14944.0,Patient,"yeah that's a big one, because that's the reason why I was using his I could fit in all these click extra small clothes and. It felt so good, even though to other people, you know they probably at a certain point they're like okay either your. Maybe saying or you're on drugs or like people are guessing like you know or I probably don't work out and they've been I pray that they probably knew I didn't work out like to get them like so. High yeah it's not really a healthy thing, but to me it was like i'm on top of the world because i'm like oh i'm so yeah."
760.0,Provider,"We would you like to include on this treatment plan some some type of a goal of getting your kids back. To continue, because I know you're doing you're already taking these concrete steps, but would you like to include that on there to complete this process and get the custody of your kids back. Is there, she is there's something like that. yeah So what does three things you're doing to get your kids get back."
14944.0,Patient,"yeah I want to continue my study of like you know, recovery and, like, for my mental health and the the use of the drugs that drug, I want to continue it, I mean I rarely recovery and never stopped like you never. Know balding so. must go on it, because you know there's going to be a point where it's like you some day, you could feel down and. You think about it's like the drug or something that made you feel better and then you know you have those thoughts they're getting less, though, like you know I feel it's only when I feel like i'm really looking like all look in the mirror and i'm like I got anorexia before. I was almost. Always so i'll be looking in the mirror and I go oh my God I can't believe you can't fit in any of these clothes and it's like you're looking at you like you don't look the same and. that's when I go if I used, then I would not eat probably and I would just lose a quick like you know 10 pounds or something five pounds like. It would not take that long and that's the only time that it's like that, like, I really do that's the only reason I freakin want to use it's weird. But I don't feel it's getting really few and far between because I now realize that, like a lot of people are telling me oh you look healthy like you look fine agree like you're healthier than. you've been a long time, and so, and my kids like they always told me and beautiful, so I am starting to work on that."
760.0,Provider,Self image thing. So the self The self image kind of spills over into body image.
14944.0,Patient,"Yes, yeah do you myself yeah."
760.0,Provider,"All right. So tell me Marbella. Do you think you need to lose weight, or do you think that or if you went to the doctor right now and and and or the nutritionist let's say that. and asked. about your weight and your overall health as far as diet and exercise what you would you be told."
14944.0,Patient,"I think they would say. to exercise, because you like your weight is fine, but if you want, I mean exercise is healthy and that if you want to you know tone up or like you know be. Like feel better than exercise would probably be the route to go, not only is it good for your body it's good for your mental health and it just makes you feel good you know I can say about like my doctor and I just talked to him."
760.0,Provider,he's really okay.
14944.0,Patient,"yeah he's athletic he, like run he's like older really like he's like in his late 70s, but you still run and bicycles and actually was his medical assistant, and so we go way back and. he's just like so yeah that's what he told me."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so does that sound like some type of a goal."
14944.0,Patient,"yeah, I would like to set a goal also is this is this program so anything to do with my children like I normally do not stick with anything for very long because I either get bored. Or, I am just like I have so many things going on my add is all like okay Well now, you can do that later and then later never comes. Back to like honestly like I really do like like the body image seeing and how I appearance is a big thing to me and I started sprouted from my grandmother she taught me to be a certain way and so. I hate that sometimes, but I would like to have like a fitness I really would like, I think it would make me happy to feel like I don't think I need to lose weight, I just want to tone up to where I feel like better about myself."
760.0,Provider,yeah maybe it's just like a body. muscle mass kind of an issue not not wait not not quoting size or like that.
14944.0,Patient,"yeah, as I said, oh go ahead, sorry."
760.0,Provider,"Sometimes I think they say that muscle weighs more than fat so sometimes when people get trim they might gain weight i'm cool. So would that have any kind of a psychological impact if that were to happen, you will gain muscle mass or not."
14944.0,Patient,"I think at first i'd be like what the heck but, like, I think it would be nice too, because the my problem is like, I just want to like. Read to see sections, and so my stomach area, you know i'm like oh I don't like and the only time it goes away like i've ever seen like this, because they you know how they cut right there. It goes away is when i'm super super thin and it's like you know the stomach doesn't feel like it's like. No, no. Big but, like you know, and I also love in the back of my mind i'm like, why are you so focused on this graph like. it's like 33 I have two kids, and I mean people will tell me all the time, like, I see myself and i've always seen myself different than anybody ever see me."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so do you do you want to work on, maybe, maybe there's some way you could get exercise it doesn't mean you're you know. going to the gym or running 20 miles or anything like that, but is there, something that you could do, maybe as an activity with your kids that would. be healthy for you can you physical activity and finding that bonding opportunity with them. That would be good for your mental health. And just move your body just a little bit at you, is would that be something."
14944.0,Patient,"Because I wanted. It like cuz I love it that's what I found an APP and I love this off like it tells you each so it's like lose. weight or this much way in 30 days or lose weight in 30 days and tone like if there's one for toning up one for like, if you want to lose a few pounds and like they tell you each exercise to do it even does it with you like. It shows the person like doing it and then it's it there's a timer so it like so it's like Okay, and then it counts down guys 321 and then they're so. they're good I mean there's something that really most people could do so my kids and I were doing that every night that I go to my mom's for about a week. And then I was doing so i'll still have nails I worked out and then I would come home, sometimes I do this because it's like Okay, if that wasn't enough here do a second REP for here's another set of exercises."
760.0,Provider,"So I turn on music and I was doing and I was like Okay, I like this."
14944.0,Patient,"And then I just was like okay well i'm going to take a couple days, because I went out with my friend. One night for karaoke and I was like okay well I can't I don't feel like doing it today and then one day let's do like three days i'm like okay well it's been too long now, like what's the point and lost my progress. yeah I don't know why I let that happen because I was happy, but I would really like to have a goal of sticking to something like not giving up."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, can I can I make a suggestion in the way of changing that little thought. I think I think when we have goals about especially things like fitness it's it becomes this all or nothing kind of thing like. I started a program it's always easier in the beginning, once you decide to do something all can lead to do this and there's like a new motivation, because it's a new routine. And you go and then over time, you find success, and then you start to feel a little bit lots and then I miss a day or two and then instead of getting back into the routine on the third day after missing two days or one hour many days I just throw the whole thing away like it failed."
14944.0,Patient,And that's what I did.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so so working, how could we restructure thinking and belief system."
14944.0,Patient,"i'm probably focusing on that okay well. it's not like an all or nothing it shouldn't be all or nothing type thing, it should be like Okay, well, I worked out three days. And took a few days break but it's still healthy to continue on like just because I missed three days. Only missed three days, maybe next week, you will miss two days or one day, but like continuing on to show that way, I mean because it's good for me, no matter if I miss three days or not it's good to exercise."
760.0,Provider,Or you can focus on the positive like. Instead of saying I missed three days. You can say I did my exercise for three days.
14944.0,Patient,yeah I did a week.
760.0,Provider,"ago okay so. Well, you probably need some kind of a break. yeah pending on how intense it is unless it's super light."
14944.0,Patient,"I just said, I started writing it in my calendar, because I like to see like I like to see progress, I like to build and this is like i'm. Such a visual person, it makes me like that's what makes me go forward we're so i'm new I think I might. Not my I was really feels like you know what i'm just gonna start doing the APP again because also keeps track in the APP and I really liked it like i'll turn on I mean it happened, it was such a quick workout and there are things that I. I used to do modern dance in high school and like I really like some some I remember from that, like the exercise warm ups and it's just a quick program it's like your exercises like boom and you feel like you've exercised."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, how How long does it take normally when you do this specific Program."
14944.0,Patient,"But i'm each I you know I don't know how quick, I know that it's each REP of exercises like it counts, down from 30 so you're doing like I want to say, like. 30 minutes or maybe."
760.0,Provider,"A 30 minute exercise so Okay, I will you be is. Is this an APP do you think you'll be able to do with your kids like."
14944.0,Patient,yeah.
760.0,Provider,"I think you're spending time with them, or when they come back to you. full time."
14944.0,Patient,"yeah I think I should do see when I was going over there for bedtime I will we do dinner, and then I would use this, I would say okay. You know, if you want to work out with me to first they're like no. And then they'd hear me out there, because I do it regardless at my mom's I just start working like you know I feel like down on the ground i'm doing these. I showed it to my daughter comes in lay something down and she's like doing it and then my son hears us and then he comes out and then the next day that i'm like okay it's time and then they were like okay mom we're coming so yeah they will enjoy anything that is with me so. I and it's good for them, because it makes them more tired for bit."
760.0,Provider,More time for bed it's that's a healthy pattern of exercise kind of sets. Back going for them to continue as they get older and then your memory with you too.
14944.0,Patient,"yeah yeah being for all of all of us, maybe I should have a goal to like have this be something like be kind of a war, like the because that says it's such a big. thing to me like the I mean that's one of my I mean that's the reason why really because I I didn't use drugs, because I was like. yeah I use checks through literally just to lose weight like it's really that big of a deal for me, so I think that, like maybe I don't know i'm a therapy sessions, you just make sure that we can I can bring it up and just like tell you my progress like."
760.0,Provider,"The account, I want, I want to focus though just just because of your overall mental health. You know, eating disorders, is another addiction it's also very unhealthy and bad for you physically mentally emotionally, so I want to be mindful of that. You know, so I do kind of like your your goal of you know, wanting to improve yourself scene and and also your body image."
14944.0,Patient,"me, I want to be healthy, I don't want to be like sickly then anymore, I want to get to where it's just I feel i'm sorry like I said i'm like feeling okay about myself right now but. When I say my period comes or something it's like you know because."

So I think there is something wrong."
760.0,Provider,"yeah I think I think I would start with the gynecologist and and have the gynecologist you know you can bring up that question about the hormones, but start with the Dennis colleges and go from there. Okay, just just to make sure that there's not something going on physically that's causing that I don't know that's."
14944.0,Patient,"Really, I mean it's. Such a I hate being like it's a little more, since I mean i'm more aware of the how other people feel that I was like because I would just. ran it was like off the friggin on like so mean I feel like my words are like they cut like and I just want. I want i'm just demanding and like you know all those things that people probably are on their period but miners way up there with like I could chase them away like from me and i'm on my period like oh that's going to end, but I just. cause, I mean this person like who wants to keep putting up with that. You know okay I don't want. That to people I don't like it yeah It makes me not happy. Okay, so yeah maybe i'll make an appointment with the gynecologist."
760.0,Provider,"And I think I think that would be good, just to check that box and make sure there's nothing. That needs treatment or needs attention, or something. But back to the body image thing. I guess how would you feel about the possibility of journaling about body image and. What I would want you to do when you're maybe doing some journaling about the way you think about the way you look even just right now exercise no exercise. Can you write a journal like you're talking to your daughter, and not yourself and kind of play this little mental image game."
14944.0,Patient,To kind of like cash. Like talking so what I be talking.
760.0,Provider,"Since the things either things know to to journal, you would write in a journal so."
14944.0,Patient,You. would be writing in a journal.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, and, and so the things you think about your your body and the image of your body, if you can like journal about that. And then, at the bottom of the page afterwards, if you could like flip the switch switch and take make it a like a little mental imagination game and pretend that you're responding to your daughter."
14944.0,Patient,Like how she do she's see it's. Not about myself is how she say she's seeing that in herself and then.
760.0,Provider,yeah.
14944.0,Patient,"Actually me yeah I was thinking about that the other day I was like. You know, because, like sometimes I will just it'll come out of my mouth like you know say like low and way God, I like so fat or like. Getting that here, or like i'm like i'll just say something about myself and i'll be like oh God look at you today, like just sometimes like randomly. Say i'll say this little thing under my breath if I see a mirror and i'm like okay gotta walk back because um it's like whatever she live see her how much he looks up to me shy it's caught her was she watches me she looks at me like I am a movie star or something but she's. Like he's like he idolized it, I mean i'm a mom little girls look up to their mother, so I don't want to do that anymore, because I never I never wanted her to ever feel like that about her I can't control that but I can control my mouse, and when I."
760.0,Provider,"My feelings, you can control what you model for her. yeah I know if you. feel that part of yourself, then, as she gets older, you can have a conversation about that."
14944.0,Patient,Because she's beautiful and there's no I mean parents see their children is gorgeous and handsome but there's no I wanted to know I don't ever want her to feel like me ever ever ever ever.
760.0,Provider,again. it's not about an exercise about her it's.
14944.0,Patient,You know it's about.
760.0,Provider,it's about you like a little mental exercise. yeah to shift to shift that brain because. Self esteem and body image it's going to be driven by the things I say to myself.
14944.0,Patient,"yeah no I totally get what you're I totally get exercise I I, I think that it will help my help me. to shift my thinking and like think better about myself, because the more I go on in the journal and i'm having i'm say seeing saying when I see about me. And then having to think about it, and her telling me it and then it will like over time, I think it will help heal the way I feel because, after so long of responding Mike is like i'm going to probably start believing what I say. Like I get Like you, I totally get the exercise."
760.0,Provider,"Do you do you do because. The way the human being, brain works, we have these habits of thinking we think and the end of that that habits drive our emotions either to make us feel more positive emotions or more negative. And then, over time, the more we continue to think this we get this irrational belief around it and so it's it's a process of like trying to like look at that being being realistic with that. I like because I also know that you there's a mom you wouldn't want your daughter, to be like she would want her to be healthy, in a balanced way. You would want her to be fit so that she's healthy physically mentally emotionally. Yes, not to be hard on herself so there's there's a balance with that. So if you kind of put yourself in the mind frame of how would I talked to my daughter and start practicing talking to you're saying yourself the way you would talk to your daughter it's like a mental exercise for you to kind of weed that out."
14944.0,Patient,"I think it'll be really good I actually really like it. Is there's so much more to life, it starts from my childhood, I really think it like over time, I think that it will be very. good thing for me because I figured out how I would work on the honestly i've never really thought about that, so I really like that idea and I think. I think I should do like maybe pray daily like how I like because I mean for a while, or however long daily would probably be good, because you know honestly daily it changes how I feel about myself almost daily. Keeping a journal. Or, as often you know i'm I know it's like it's hard to say if you're going to do something, every day, so I say like."
760.0,Provider,"Well, the journal journal can be something short term. I don't want you to sit that. You know, in the same way you don't have to exercise for two hours a day. yeah said 30 minutes okay i'm going to journal for 15 maybe maybe pick a time that's I prefer a time that's quiet either early in the morning, or maybe before bed whichever fits your personality, because you don't want. You know you don't want the world start encroaching on your time to journal because that's like reflective time. doesn't have to be any long thing it's the. Consistency that matters. yeah so it could be a couple paragraphs like one paragraph, of how you felt the weight, you know the the old destructive. irrational belief about you know your own image of your own your own body your own self and then the next paragraph responding like that was your daughter and correcting that."
14944.0,Patient,"And yeah I love to writing is actually art and writing there are things that like I remember when I was on drugs like when I towards the end of my use like I. pretty sure I had a mental breakdown from what went on, and then and then having I wasn't using. Like it's like when you I don't know when I was using more is like the blood level of US stuff like maintain like. And then, like like doing it and then not doing it for days it was like I was like oh don't like feeling like I don't know I started having like when it would wear off, I never had experience the parent liliya feelings like."
760.0,Provider,Oh yeah.
14944.0,Patient,"Entire you I never like literally I think I was telling you like my mom didn't know. What she thought I was sober when I was using for the longest time because I was even able to maintain I. Because I never i've never been into enough to where people are like oh she's like it was at the end when I my mental health was so poor and then I was using it like maybe like. A depressant taking it and then not taking a date not are like taking it and then going days like you know you come up and then you come down and my mental health, so at that point, the parent like being paranoid and i'm. Like i'm starting to feel like okay. Like I can is someone like that or am I, because of my ex I kept the you know he's a big deal down in the small town i'm in like I was like Okay, are they watching me too, because the iPad the pearl come out and they were going to do come in here for him. So he had me paranoid too so anyways long story short, I started when I get really when I get really scared feeling or that paranoid I start journaling like I would write to take my mind off that so it's a healing thing for me to color or to write."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, well, you can write longer if you want to I just again these goals, they need to be concrete, they need to be achievable and we can start small. And the treatment plan is not written in stone, once we. Once we said, it is something that will evolve as you evolve as you get better. You might just subtract things you might add things or change things and we kind of go from there. Okay, does that make sense. Yes, okay so okay so um."
14944.0,Patient,you're showing me I need to add to the treatment blend.
760.0,Provider,Okay.
14944.0,Patient,"The big part of this whole thing is modeling like you know, the use of that drug and my body image, those are things that. would be by image has been forever and then the drug use, like you know that's so like you know the most unhealthy thing and then the domestic fight like the so the relationship with my ex boyfriend. He like a like a right to like he entered my mind like i'm a strong minded person and like he's. Nuts like he's a person that he doesn't want to let go of me like."
760.0,Provider,it's still happening.
14944.0,Patient,"really know like it's like he was under 24 hour lockdown to where he couldn't make phone calls to me, and that was probably the best thing because, during that time, I really separated like I it was achievable to get to the point where I just i'm starting to not. I don't really have feelings like that for him anymore, all I have for him is like you know I have answered the phone for him to him and. it's like i'll tell him like Okay, because i'm waiting for him to like go like completely away like I told him okay well I finally found someone. wasn't my like my husband coming back is like you know within reason I have someone that I like and I was like Okay, well, I found somebody you know I want you to know if this is not I can't we can't do this, like my kid is just not happening and. I found somebody that I, you know, the first person, since you that I really like like him, he. makes me feel happy and I thought, and then I told them like I went out with them and we've we were together and like you know, and he just doesn't. i'm like what how I don't know how to. I need to finalize that like, because the truth is that."
760.0,Provider,He want to finalize. You want to finalize the relationship with your ex boyfriend.
14944.0,Patient,"yeah I do, but then there's a part of me that, like he I don't know what it is like I feel like a he feels like it's home like he feels like. Are you have a do you have borderline and once you attach to somebody like as I don't just well I don't love easily like it takes I love my kids I love my mother I love. When I love it takes a lot, besides my you know my built in people it's like it takes a long time for me to love someone and once I love them it's like it's like a soul attached like it's like a I really love them, and so I really, really loved him."
760.0,Provider,Okay okay so you're still feeling that my devil.
14944.0,Patient,"yeah I do somewhere in my heart, like I don't. know what to do, do they do. I wanted it to be. Like we talked about you know I wanted like what we said, like it would have to be together and have a family, like you know he wanted to marry him one point when he asked me, and I just we. he's such a great like off drugs like he's just not the same as when he's on drugs, but like he started to be twice a wreck. All like he. He said a lot to me it's such a little time and it's so unhealthy but it's like I really he was my best friend that I really miss Jones."
760.0,Provider,Who was your best friends off the drugs. And he. Is it fair to say he was the complete opposite of that on drums.
14944.0,Patient,"yeah he's a monster or drugs are drugs he his eyes are like he has little beautiful blue eyes, what about drugs it's so sad like for me it's like. it's like because i've seen about the camera jail like what are you cold on there and it's like I look at him he's not a drugs and i'm like I wish, but that could be like that, but he's only he's also he's 2533 and there's a big difference in bit tool. He was married at 17 so he's you know he he did use either until this last year he's only used for a year, but he's had so much happened is the year, and he."
760.0,Provider,He has. He has a severe substance use disorder from what you're describing.
14944.0,Patient,"Also yeah he has body image. So he asked he wrote me a letter recently and he says, you know why I always because he was like be when I remember see him around. He was big like I mean really, really big like not just like I mean he had a. reason to feel like he's always been big like he was over 300 pounds and that spelled it was somewhat introduced to it, he was going to college and. This girl got him on it, and he lost all that weight and so he says, you know weren't always like why I always go back. And i've never talked to really about my body issues that he's like I always go back because of how big I wasn't like it just doesn't feel good to be like that he says that stuff it like makes me, it makes me feel better yeah so it's, I guess, he has a lot of similar issues."
760.0,Provider,"Oppression can we can we still slow this down a little bit. Yes, I remember you talking about you go ahead and fill your feelings I don't I don't need you to stop you're okay with that I just want to kind of challenge you a little bit. So he's reaching out to you mailing calling you sending you letters and he's in jail."
14944.0,Patient,yeah he's in jail. anyway.
760.0,Provider,What do people in jail what what is the thing they typically want they want peep they want to write people they want people to write back to them right.
14944.0,Patient,"yeah I don't ever write back I barely answer, because I know like CPS like but it can't it just can't be. And my kids don't like you know they don't want it to be at CPS said no, and so it's like I feel like I jeopardize but like because that's the part of this is, I can't go back to him, like, no matter what. Like, I would like to say, like I like I wish I could keep the world separate I wish that I could like."
760.0,Provider,If you wanted. To go back to that abuse Mandela.
14944.0,Patient,"No, I don't want to go back to that no I just for me it's like the fairy tale portion of it, where. he's sober and he's like exactly who I want it. Where he's like but I can't I can't ever guarantee that because that's i'm not in control of him. And he's already done it twice he started twice it for me to do it, a third time would make me fucking idiot because i've already lost so much there's nowhere to lose except for my life, like you know. Okay, so what. yeah."
760.0,Provider,"Sorry, and I had to some journaling. yeah okay. Can you journal. Can you just write down all the things that being with him cost you."
14944.0,Patient,got a new in.
760.0,Provider,"You know I think a lot of women. And maybe even some men, sometimes we fall in love with an idea. not really a person. and live with in our mind we we, this is what we remember this is what we mourn for. Completely forgetting that this is what it was over here, something completely opposite something completely different, and you know we've we've met together, you and I, a couple of times now, and every time we've met you've expressed to me, and I believe you that my kids come first."
14944.0,Patient,We do.
760.0,Provider,"And even if the system, let you have him in your life, how would that impact your children emotionally mentally."
14944.0,Patient,"The last night, they told me. they're feeling exhausted, I said Bobby or my side like he. He goes molly I don't like him, I said, well, I mean I said well. Why, I started, I was saying why that I was like that's not how I want to say, I want to ask him what. His feelings were like I don't know how to even work like. Like what is it like what I don't know what his little mind I just because I know what happened, but I wanted to why."
760.0,Provider,Did you get your kids they saw the the abuse right.
14944.0,Patient,"See I didn't think that they did, but apparently I don't know what because my you know my kids like. A lot, but I really believe that, like they did I said said he had come in at all, he could hear how he was talking to me, and he goes Bobby I heard you cry. He says, I heard you crying Bobby and I don't I hated it, he said I don't like it because I didn't know why he was saying all such need stuff to make you cry it. And why he you are you got to keep praying because I made me feel good Bobby right don't ever one of the he's in prison mommy right because they don't want to come out again because he has been to at her you. might have daughter says, I don't she doesn't like issue I don't like a bully I don't we don't want her Bobby."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so without going into details. Maybe it's just a simple answer Mr Della maybe it's you know we talked last time about ptsd and safety, maybe it's just it and I don't feel safe. And, and again there's physical safety there's emotional safety too. And i'm you know."
14944.0,Patient,"it's so hard, this is the hardest part is like. This, the last thing that's taking the longest because of my like I literally have the I mean I really have a hard time can I mean I can't connect with people on a friend level, but like. Once I give it and once I feel that my heart it's like I just it takes me it takes a while I so process of morning it, the whole thing because I it just is it just see yes, the idea of like what what I wanted with this person, but it's also like I. We grew to be friends like we're a lot like he has similar to like think about him better, like me, I wish that we would have just been friends, because that's what we should have it, because they don't. know what I want to have like. I don't think romantically like no we're magically we can't be because it's like you know he just thought healthy like."
760.0,Provider,already been having him as a friend he's he's already told you what he's going to do with the math. Because of the way that whatever the reason.
14944.0,Patient,"yeah you guys like i've never going to do it i'm not going to use it wisely finally i've you know i've had enough because he's been there, so we typed in what year it. is just like I just don't there's no bigger reason first him to like I have all like a lot of variety got the whole thing and for him it's like. I don't think he has the power to do it, I don't need to worry wonder whether about he's going to do it or not, because he's so crazy what he's audit that there's just so. I just can't. It just might hurt her because I really I just loved him like a like he just as a cup I think he's a cup for things like just the you know just him."
760.0,Provider,Can I make a suggestion. focus on you build your relationship with you. continue to be a good mom.
14944.0,Patient,that's what i've tried to do.
760.0,Provider,"Because even if he's clean and sober the memory, for your kids is still gonna be there. it's like a whole can of. You know it's done."
14944.0,Patient,it's done. And then. You would have ever again.
760.0,Provider,"yeah it's done, and even if you could legally do it and not have a problem with CPS would you want to make your kids feel unsafe."
14944.0,Patient,"No, I would never ever that's what they like what I. Like what i've had those thoughts of okay like keeping it separate me like it could never be like they're still scenario in my mind like I could come up with that, because they will never be in the same room with them, I never would have him even. There they wouldn't be able to say block. Like he's not allowed me and he knows he's not allowed at where deer they will never see him, like their child lives even like it till they're located or she related to their growth, they will never see this bad again."
760.0,Provider,"remember how we talked about irrational thoughts. I just want to question the question. Okay, maybe it's possible you can love again somebody who's not toxic or dangerous. Yes, maybe you're not quite ready."
14944.0,Patient,i've. got.
760.0,Provider,"And that's and you can still have care for this person that you that you care about. When he, especially when he's clean, you can still care for him from afar, you can still wish the best from him from afar. And that you don't have to. You don't have to save him."
14944.0,Patient,"I can't see them you. save your setup yeah I have to hear. mom yeah this was so it was an awakened eat like I still have the you know, sometimes like great out like how i'm really excited like I have the emotions about it it's like going through a grieving process. But they do come first and no matter what like I never failed ever jeopardy again of anything ever again."
760.0,Provider,"So I can. Have a conversation with yourself I miss him I love him if you want this is what you want to say to them, but at the same time, my kids come first. And just kind of keep repeating that in your mind."
14944.0,Patient,"That I should tell like. because she asked me to tell him that, like. Tell them it's over and like you know I guess he doesn't get I have our type would be direct with that, like do you think I should tell him directly that it's like there is no. Like instead of being like Okay, you know that this can't be in this like i've got like around it will try to tell them. But I don't know if I should just not ever answer again, or if I should tell him because he said if it's over like that just tell me because he's like i'd rather go through it, but like feel like you know, like have hope. I don't know what I should do."
760.0,Provider,"That could be a minute, but I don't I don't. know because these. These got these this double side, so we don't really know where, if this is just like a way in."
14944.0,Patient,Like the.
760.0,Provider,So. I think.
14944.0,Patient,ever.
760.0,Provider,yeah I honestly. You want my truthful answer. yeah I think you should change your number and block them.
14944.0,Patient,"Okay. yep. that's where i'm getting to is I was gonna see if I could walk him through the jail, which i'm sure I can block it."
760.0,Provider,"Especially if you're not supposed to be in contact with them, legally, for your for."
14944.0,Patient,"yeah they are not part of that there's also the judge put an order the judge has read I can't take it down the judge put a restraining order for three years, that I can't. talk to him."
760.0,Provider,And to ensure you can. Especially if it's a.
14944.0,Patient,"it's been a process, I have literally getting there it's just like so freakin hard it's like I really it's like a dual legal what it took to love, because I didn't even. When you when I look back at it like I didn't like the guy first and i'm just like my mom he, like soggy you by friends, so he started like. Coming around and i'm just like oh I just felt like you like you leave me alone and then like you know he grew on me and when someone. Like a love that's like oh you just love somebody it's like it's like a pastor grow over time, if you have to undo all back is like well, it took me this long and I really like now, I really love versus like okay. But i'm at the point of where the only feeling like when I cry is because i'm picturing that fantasy like that whole. I keep hearing him say I want this baby review of this family, and I think in my head that's what I want my kids that I want I do want one more child someday I do want this fit this family and that's what he says to me at the end of every conversation. So I think it's like i'm grieving that like okay yeah."
760.0,Provider,"yeah yeah so yeah talk yourself through that green green what you've got agree, but I think I really think you should just block him because that's kind of tell them."
14944.0,Patient,"No, you."
760.0,Provider,"don't know this, this will be all just to show they have nothing to do in jail."
14944.0,Patient,"Good he's crazy ass shit like if I don't know who this man like I wish I could see because he's come up with all of you Okay, so this diagnosis diagnosis. You know, he I think he might have a like I think he has different personalities and I heard him telling me that he was diagnosed with that because I see different. You there's different people in there and I there's one that I love so much he is the clear blue eyes within the other ones. He has at least three or 4am like those other ones I don't love the single single single bottom and he can't maintain that one that I love that one is only there sometimes so it's like it really is a fantasy that i'm in love with like."
760.0,Provider,yeah.
14944.0,Patient,yeah well. You know.
760.0,Provider,"We talked about self esteem building and self esteem building and it's a process of learning to love to accept and also love oneself. And everything in life, I mean that's good and bad things are always going to happen, but as we heal as we grow good things come into your life. And I would work on the kind of language that you that you were talking about that i'm never going to love like that again because you know we're going to start working on this stuff. And, and I think it's sane and healthy to you know be cautious with people in the very beginning, you don't want to open yourself to the wrong person, so you when you meet somebody, especially if it's a romantic. feeling that you're having you, you want to get to know the person before you're going to bring them around your kids or even just in your own life. yeah so so. With that is fine there's nothing wrong with taking your time to trust somebody there's nothing wrong with thinking that's well I think that's healthy, especially for somebody who has two kids that are small."
14944.0,Patient,"Here, and I would like to obviously like. You already know my husband I were married I mean i'll be 10 years this year that we're married I would really like to give that a go. Like you know if he's able to if he's maintaining like this, what i'm doing like is he won't be able to see which I mean the children mean a lot to him as well, and so he I don't know i'd like to give that a go because we had a good thing, going on asleep, for a very long time and. There was something that happened and it was not. That wouldn't happen. they'll be together but."
760.0,Provider,yeah so gonna come down to the. Whether he can maintain a recovery.
14944.0,Patient,"That and that is the base game so number one, and then it has to be eased into because I have, I may damage human that I can't just go okay like. yeah he'll again it's like it's with me it's a for anybody that I mean it's been long enough that we're a part that it's going to be the same process it's like getting to know each other and like again like easing into it and seeing if I feel like doing that."
760.0,Provider,yeah wanted. To do it on a friend level like a. Co co parenting first and and friendship second and just slow it down because the bottom line in order to be successful in any kind of romantic relationship or partner type of relationship is to have a relationship with oneself.
14944.0,Patient,"That we have yeah. And that's really what I. need is to just fit like I need to keep working on myself, because I, you have to be happy with yourself and everything about. You know inside, you have to be happy to be able to make someone else Happy New Year to make something work and have a healthy relationship with someone, you have to be happy with yourself. and work on yourself and that's my first priority is, I mean I arrays are making myself the best I can be and feeling great because that's how the kids will I mean that's they can see when i'm sad or down. I see all these things and. I have to be at my best. Most I mean not my best like perfect I don't want for me, but I have to be okay to be okay for them so that is first and then they I mean it's neck and neck there them and me, are the What matters, you know."
760.0,Provider,"yeah I think it's going to be useful for you to write them with your with your ex boyfriend the one in jail write down.

Things people are doing like showing you that it really saying I could say I love learning anything like you know anybody can say I love you to anything and I don't know if he has I don't know if he can what love is him, but I know that all he showed me that's not love. know and so, for me, I think that i'm an obsession thing like a constant see and I think it's worth for him, I mean it was when he was out here like he is was obsessed. And I mean he's waited outside my door and this know like I mean he just stood out there for and there's no making them go it's like you have to. i'm like okay that's why police gotten all this lesson is i'm like you're not going to stand outside my house like, and so I think the only way to get rid of him is to. Because he'll always try and."
