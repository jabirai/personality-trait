13656.0,Patient,How are you.
705.0,Provider,"i'm doing very well, thank you for asking."
13656.0,Patient,Thank you.
705.0,Provider,How the heck are you oh.
13656.0,Patient,"i'm doing well, thank you. You know what I was thinking this morning is with. All the things that you asked about me i'm so holding myself back from like how are you what's new with you, so I want you to know that i'm always thinking of that, but I know that's not what i'm supposed to so. hello, and I hope you're having a good week."
705.0,Provider,"Thank you and know heather, that is, you know I appreciate you asking it is quite natural that we want to know about one another and how. So, to answer your question actually my week has been very well i'm also looking forward to on the weekend is my time to like disengaged go for hopefully a pipe and the weather's been perfect."
13656.0,Patient,Perfect oh gosh i'm excited for you.
705.0,Provider,"Well, thank you, thank you yeah I love to do that just connect leave the phone at home. Absolutely yeah absolutely so you know back back to you heather i'm going to sit, you know check in and see what's going on."
13656.0,Patient,"So it wasn't good week I, I think, as we talked about before I have more anxiety leading up to things than I do when things are actually happening or have happened. So my. son, I think I mentioned, he was moving out this week, so my husband, you know brought his stuff to him on Tuesday, they followed each other and like I said it's not far from where I live, but still the idea he's gone. And so he's there and he's been there since Tuesday and it sounds like it's really nice and I think the thing that got me over the hump of the stress and the anxiety over, it is my husband came home and said. That place is really nice it's like a five star hotel and i'm like Okay, you know what then i'm okay i'm not gonna feel bad for him being by himself or whatever. But I do feel like I need to go see him but i'm having huge anxiety over driving in downtown la or driving to downtown la by myself so i'm working on getting that to happen, either with someone or by myself, I that's like my next hurdle."
705.0,Provider,"Okay yeah what area, do you live in heather."
13656.0,Patient,I live in thousand oaks so I don't know where you're located but i'm i'm we're about an hour away if the traffic's not too bad from where he lives so but it's just it's downtown la it's crazy and you know so i'm working up to being able to handle that drive.
705.0,Provider,"Okay, and just as an alternative, I live in an orange county. But the. Train Amtrak sometimes it's really nice."
13656.0,Patient,really is a good idea.
705.0,Provider,Because I hear you on the traffic part la.
13656.0,Patient,"Oh, my gosh I know it's a whole different set of rules for driving there I feel like i'm and yeah so I that's a really good idea, and you know what I was somewhere yesterday, and I saw a. commuter bus and I it said it was going to usc and i'm like. Wait a minute that's a far place for a bus from where I am so I was thinking of looking into other things because I know the parking is even terrible where he is so you know parking my car and then having to pay. Like $50 just to park to visit him like I yeah So if I i'm gonna look into Amtrak that's a really good idea."
705.0,Provider,And Amtrak to the Union station in La now has really upgraded there's even like a little CAFE I mean it's so possible meeting point it sits helped.
13656.0,Patient,"Oh, my gosh i'm excited now i'm going to look into that for sure, thank you."
705.0,Provider,"Oh. Well, thank you, I used to go up to. ventura, and so the Amtrak I loved it because you get the ocean view so great."
13656.0,Patient,"so nice that's where we just move from was ventura we moved here about almost two years ago and yeah we we were in ventura for almost 15 years so interest Nice. It and I think we. We did our time there and it was time to move on, but. yeah it's a wonderful train ride from orange county to. ventura all."
705.0,Provider,"It is and it's just one of those things where California traffic, we can either let it stop us in our tracks are fine fine like these alternative ways, and I know even with. track it's not perfect, sometimes they have delays so just know that that sometimes that happens, and when I do I just be able to get to my phone read extra news and stuff and."
13656.0,Patient,"kind. Of a time to unwind in its own way, which is nice."
705.0,Provider,"Right right it's exactly how is it then with your son and so that's one part of it is knowing he's Okay, and where he's going as is sounds like you're like Okay, this is healthy, how are you with not having him at. You know he's been there for a while."
13656.0,Patient,"Exactly, that is a. I am sad that he's not here but it's been coming for so long and he's kind of checked out of hanging out with mom and dad and he's very he was very. Like short and not engaging with me and I was over the top, like, I would go out of my way, I still was like hi how was your day, even though I get the fine or whatever answers. And he even had said, a long time, please like when I move out it'll be different i'll be visiting you and i'll be focused on. Visiting you it's not i'm not going to be this you know so called jerk that's not interested, so I think for him it'll be great because, hopefully, when I do see him the time will be more valuable. You know, quality over quantity. um, but I am sad i'm you know I go by his room and i'm just like oh he's not there, but in another way i'm kind of relieved just knowing that this is what he's been working toward and he was so ready and excited to go, so in that respect i'm i'm good."
705.0,Provider,"And that's good that you appreciate both home you're like yes say I miss him he's growing up, but it's this next chapter and he played a big part of giving giving him, you know ready and prepared to leave."
13656.0,Patient,"I hope so, I you know there's so many times, where I. Second, well, probably not even second but 10 times guests, you know parent fail on so many issues, because I was always. The type that I want to give him what I didn't have, and so there were times because he's an only child where i'm like oh no he's been spoiled and my husband would even say you're too lenient on him and. That that's just who I am i'm not the you know part disciplinary and that's not my role i'm so you know I have those battles of hopefully I gave him enough tools to be able to be independent and figure things out but. he's his own person also, so I think he's found his way of you know what he wants to do and he's very focused, so I have to just have faith in that."
705.0,Provider,"Yes, and just the fact that he recognized, of how I was at the House doesn't excuse the behavior, but it is nice to hear. He recognizes that and as to me sharing with you i'm going to have a different relationship, when I go through this next part of my life and and we're not as connected at the House, but I still be there."
13656.0,Patient,"Yes, oh I like that you said that because yeah that's a simple thing, but to hear that back to me, is a big deal."
705.0,Provider,"yeah and that, for his age that he's mindful of that."
13656.0,Patient,"Yes, yes for sure, and I think for him, it was really frustrated because all of his circle of friends, they all went away to school like right after high school and he did not. he's been with us inventor and then moved here and he's gone to junior college, the whole time he hasn't you know slacked off, but. I think it was really difficult for him to just see all of his friends, you know, doing the College life, and you know living that and then. So he was I feel like he kind of resented us for a while, because we weren't the parents that were like here's money to go to school and will pay for everything like he needed to figure it out on his own we just didn't have that kind of money. So, but I think in the past year or two he's kind of he's not as resentful and he's not as so called jealous of his friends, I think he realizes he's different than them and a few ways so he's I think he's appreciating the way that his is going, I hope, i'm hoping that's the case."
705.0,Provider,"yeah and with that too is if he's the only child and balancing that out where he didn't get to have just that opportunity to leave it's like no. you're going to stay here and what makes financial sense, where that gratitude is probably even greater where he is now I had to work a little bit more for it."
13656.0,Patient,"Exactly yeah he I think he he is a spender when he gets money like it burns a hole in his pocket, which I understand as well, but. He I think he realizes that not everything is just given to you and I think a lot of his friends kind of have that relationship with their parents so. I think he is learning a lot of lessons, even though he's been with us this whole time but he's learning a lot of adult lessons, you know more so in the what the real world will be like compared to his friends."
705.0,Provider,"yeah and a safe place to explore a little bit, but not get ahead of themselves and to build character, I mean all those things are so important, yes. All so this. Time yes. One day, at a time it's like check off your list today it's a good day he somewhere where he is say you're filling to like this is a good choice to another chapter."
13656.0,Patient,"Yes, absolutely."
705.0,Provider,sure. And for it for you and those other chapters How has it been like really taken a look and exploring and having some self discoveries.
13656.0,Patient,"I think you know what this therapy with you and even with my group as well because i've never done therapy, I am really welcoming to it and I love. That I do get to focus on my thoughts and feelings because, like I said I don't like to focus on myself, I never liked to be Center of attention, I don't like. You know too much asking about me in a general sense, because I feel like it's too self centered i'm even with friends or family it's like people ask me things and i'll kind of. hit the surface of what i'm really where i'm really at, and then I kind of you know deflect Oh, how are you and I, you know so. This has really helped me to kind of really dive in, and you know analyze Why do I do this or you know really focus on it, but. Another thing that I wanted to bring up today that I kind of want to work on and I don't know if this is something that I can only work on or if it's more of a couples thing but. Since my husband, I have been married and like I said i've been almost 25 years. I think now it's heightened because my son is gone I don't have that excuse anymore oh he's home, but the whole intimacy thing is a huge deal that I think I need to work on for my own self. He is. I mean it's caused a lot of riffs over the years and he's always like all the time, I feel like he's almost addicted to the Internet thing and i'm just like, no, no, no i'm. And I don't know why that is, and I don't know if he's more than normal or if i'm just holding back and I kind of want to figure and i've tried so many times myself to figure out why I have these issues with it, but oh my gosh it's just tough like I. I just feel like it's never enough it's never right or I don't do enough, I mean it's, so I think for me that's my next goal to work on, especially with current gone I need to kind of work on myself and then our relationship as a couple. So I kind of just wanted to. Bring that out there, that that."
705.0,Provider,"That that has been a topic this week and. It is just like you know when we talk about sex and having a healthy sex drive having a healthy sex life, yes, when you've been in a relationship, for you know you said 25 years."
13656.0,Patient,mm hmm.
705.0,Provider,"There comes a part where, how do you reconnect, how do you, you know, not only for him, but about your needs and so i'm hearing, maybe he has even a higher sex drive years isn't as much because maybe the need to connect as in a different way."
13656.0,Patient,"Yes, I would agree with that."
705.0,Provider,So now finding out those ways you're wanting to connect and then how to be able to share where you're comfortable with him.
13656.0,Patient,mm hmm.
705.0,Provider,about this. You know so to me being intimate with someone isn't just a physical. it's much more than that.
13656.0,Patient,"Yes, I agree, and it's an endless circle which we've talked about is, I am more let's hang out for the day and have a good day and then i'm going to be more apt to. That connection where he is the opposite he'd rather connect the physical way and then maybe the other will follow so. that's always kind of in a battle and it's kind of like okay well who's gonna you know give up their side should do the other and do the opposite way but um, so I think it's kind of just like a battle like a standoff like who's gonna be the one to. Give in or eight or not initiate."
705.0,Provider,"Exactly exactly. And it's Nice that you're bringing it up because it's different if you just go and you know already how it's been it's just like you said with your son he had an excuse, and then you feel like you're making an excuse, and then you feel like. Now i'm just dodging the person that I love and it's just like what's going on here. Yes, guys since i'm getting the two of you to be able to first of all talk about it because it's a sensitive topic and to be able to start to articulate where you know I need just like you described when I have a good day with you, when we go and do something and I feel connected. Then I want to be more physical that's how I am. Yes, and seeing if that opens the door to him or even sharing with him, can we do something my way and just trust me on it, you know. And you plan a date of how you feel like it's the best."
13656.0,Patient,"Very good idea he's always so he never wants to do anything he's I mean he works hard he's a window cleaner so he's very like physically. Working all the time, and he has his own business, so he has a lot of beef always telling me I have so much pressure to you know. Make the money and do all the things all these things but. i'm so he's physically tired he's like I don't want to go anywhere I don't want to drive in traffic i've been out all week have been outside all week. So for him coming home, even at the end of the day, he will he just wants to online watch the dodger game, and you know hang out with the dogs, where I. The more like let's I don't even care where we go I just either out of the House or doing watching a movie I learned a lot, instead of a documentary you want to watch or whatever, I mean. we're very opposite in a lot of ways which, thank goodness opposites attract because we are totally opposite. But yeah it's like you said I even will say like let's. Do something the two of us and he's always got an excuse, whether he's tired, or you know, whatever so that's another battle and I I don't know if that's a coven thing as well or it's like he's tired and it's well, what are we going to really do or. So I don't know so i'm just trying to always find creative ways to. still make a connection with him, even though it's hard."
705.0,Provider,"Right and we have these extra limitations you're right, it is also to where your work is different, your work is then again and I house, so it makes sense that you would want to be out of the House he's out of the House, he wants in the House."
13656.0,Patient,Definitely exactly.
705.0,Provider,"For my eyes on both ends where you feel like you're being heard and he feels like he's being heard and it is now, we take this extra dynamic of having coven and what is even open and what do you feel safe, even going to."
13656.0,Patient,"Exactly exactly, and then we have two puppies which we got in. let's see we got them in January and we got two French bulldog puppies that are siblings and one is blind because and. We were only going to get one, and then the lady simple we have another one in the pack that's really close to the one you're getting and he's blind, would you be interested in taking them as well because they'd be together like i'm going to say no to that. Oh, we got two. puppies and. There are a lot, I mean are awesome and we love them i'm so grateful we have them but they're a lot of work and we've. Since January we've kind of stayed home like we can't leave the dogs, or you know that kind of thing so that's been a lot of his excuse to and for us it's like Oh, we have to think twice before we go anywhere um so yeah that plays into it as well and. They will be fine if we put them in their candles and you know. they're going to be safe they're going to be okay, so I am hoping with my son gone now that maybe he'll kind of see things a little different and maybe we can have a little more freedom but that's hopefully."
705.0,Provider,"yeah it is and thinking of you know heather for you, how do you connect when it comes to your husband, how do you like to connect."
13656.0,Patient,"Oh let's see I am basically of 14 year old girl, as far as what I like like if my dream day would be going to Disneyland and coming home and just you know talking about characters at Disneyland or movie characters of Disney but. he's like Oh, you know, and I love stuffed animals, and so I have a big imagination and like you know i'll bring stuff down on the line to talk to him and he's like oh no we're not going to be 14 year olds. And i'm like so okay i'll save that for my work Okay, I get it, but um So for me like I could just walk around. anywhere and either just you know kind of people watch or just look at church keys or look at things I don't even necessarily have to buy things but i'd like to just. share with him things that I like or just laugh laughing is my favorite thing, so if we can do that that's my ultimate I love going out to eat, and I know that's not practical all the time, but I feel like that's the only time I get his undivided attention. So, to speak and. yeah so Those are the things that I love just things that I can connect with him and I kind of have his undivided attention because he's kind of all over the place, most of the time."
705.0,Provider,"yeah and that's what with taking what you want, and is there an area where you're willing to compromise, like with eating, could he choose the place or how if you go take out or not."
13656.0,Patient,"Yes, that's true, and he he goes in phases, where he's like oh let's go out to eat, and you know and i'm always find wherever you want to go i'm not a huge decision maker, you know, like oh we're going to go here and i'm not picky. So that's great and i'm so I feel so happy when he does say let's just go, you know to lunch or to eat. So those are the times that I really cherish and. Like I said he goes in phases, where it's like he'll go out to eat a lot and then it's like oh no let's save money we're going to stay home we're not gonna do anything i'm tired so. For me it's kind of just eggshells, like what mood is he going to be in or what you know how tired, is he or is he going to want to hang out and talk or is he gonna want it, you know so it's. that's a lot of my anxiety to, I think, is trying to figure out where he's out."
705.0,Provider,"trying to figure out where he's at and part of it, too, sometimes is breaking that pattern. If you're always trying to figure it out. Could you figure it out in a healthier way."
13656.0,Patient,"Yes, I probably you mean like I should. Do more what he, like hang out with him if he's at home or that kind of thing or."
705.0,Provider,"or instead of guessing because your crystal ball you don't know me, maybe where that is but just maybe asking him and and and your words of where it's not. You know, in a way, where he becomes defensive, but in a way, just like checking in you know, and it would help, possibly with this you're having to guess it. Which is creating your anxiety So is there, another way that feels comfortable for you."
13656.0,Patient,"Sometimes i'll well I always ask him, like how was your day or How does that job and he. Sometimes is willing to share and then other times he's like Oh, it was fine or whatever, and he won't say much he never asked how my day was which. Sometimes i'm fine with that another time oh my gosh he didn't even ask me how my day was so I will. skip over that and sometimes i'll just say oh listen what happened today and I don't wait for him to ask and sometimes he is willing to hear it, and sometimes he he's really not and I that kind of hurts my feelings and then other times when I go, you know, whatever let it go so. I guess yeah, I guess, I could figure out another way to kind of. And there are times, where he if he's you know just relaxing i'll just go out, you know go hang out with them in there. But the whole time i'm just sitting there Michael oh my gosh I could be doing this, and this, and this, and this and I don't want to be just sitting here so. I will go out of my comfort zone, and you know go to where he is, and you know i'm not at that stubborn, but then there's times, where I. will be it, you know doing my thing, and my craft area or writing a letter doing whatever and he was like Oh, why are you doing that, again, or you know why don't you. Come watch a movie with me or and it's always something i'm not interested in and there's times, where i'll just go okay i'll just come rocks with you, whatever, but I just feel like he doesn't do that for me and that. hurts my feelings sometimes so it's hard it's."
705.0,Provider,Right and it's hard to to then when you don't feel heard and you feel like it's on his terms to that want to turn around and be physical you know to be intimate.
13656.0,Patient,"that's, the last thing i'm like are you kidding me right now, no and then it's a huge fight where it's like you know so yeah it's it's an animal circle of."
705.0,Provider,"yeah so how to stop the cycle, because it's a pattern now, and you know now your son is out of the House and to sell it celebrate that as a couple. And how do you, you know as a couple celebrate and make it we're both of you are comfortable and what's the next you know chapter for you as a couple."
13656.0,Patient,"Yes, yes. And he. Is he's very. routine oriented and he'll even admit that he's got OCD issues but. He will wake up in the morning make his coffee. And then he every morning looks at real estate, because he really wants to move and he's been wanting to move to like Costa Rica or another country for ever now so. I feel like the anchor holding him back from what he really wants to do, and sometimes that gets to me where i'm like oh i'm being very selfish and then other times i'm like. Well i'm not going to just move to another country like that's hard for me to get on board with so i've even offered like we could. He wanted like Costa Rica, for example, is where is probably the number one choice and I love, Costa Rica, I love we've been there, I adore it I just not ready to. You know jump in and only be in Costa Rica, you know I miss my family and there's some friends i'd missed so i've even said, like if ideally if you. Have a or we had something there and then we could still be here and back and forth like that would be ideal but that's in a dream world but we can't have both. You know, financially but that's another thing, where he every morning is looking at real estate i'm just like oh that's stressful for me, because I know he's. Always thinking he wants to retire he wants to just be done and move out of the country and so that's another whole anxiety thing for me because I don't like that feeling of. Change is imminent and I have no control over it, and he's, this is what he wants and I not really on board with that and so that's been an ongoing thing as well."
705.0,Provider,mm hmm and i'm hearing heather that you're you're willing to explore it you're just not willing to make the commitment.
13656.0,Patient,"Yes, that is where i'm at and there may be a day, where that will make sense to me, but right now i'm and over the years I have gotten a little more open to the idea. i'm just not like let's just sell everything and go i'm still not at that point, and he goes back and forth like he'll be like oh I don't know about Costa Rica, like we could just go there and. vacation and come back and i'm like yes that's what we do, but he wants he wants space he wants like land he doesn't want to be in the hub of everything is the complete opposite of my son, so you know, and I like that idea, too, but I. You know it's just it's just hard to like just be out in the middle of nowhere to you know where i'm not at that point either, so I don't know it's just it's just hard to be on the same page with him on on a lot of things right now."
705.0,Provider,"And, just like you probably change your priorities and what sounds good he's doing the same, and then, how is a couple. That you keep the communication open and where the other person feels for two and it's not that you're saying no I don't want to be part of that with Costa Rica is just. I hear you but here's what i'm thinking and especially if you were saying your son is here, your son right now is in college it's like. Could it be just not the right time."
13656.0,Patient,"Exactly I mean, because for him, it was always okay when he graduated high school i'm out of here and then luckily that happened, and then it was okay well when he you know moves out and so now he's moved out so. that's a whole thing like Okay, this is this when he's really going to just say like i'm need to do this, this is my bucket list thing I need to do, or you know, so I don't know it's just that feeling of not feeling secure and. what's the word like grounded I just don't feel comfortable like I feel very. Everything feels temporary so I like that feeling because growing up, it was always that way and I I for once in my life just want to feel like Oh, we can this is ours and we can be here and we can fix it up how we want, I mean. yeah so I know that a lot of my anxiety comes from that feeling of. Not being."
705.0,Provider,"A low to you know lay your roots and that makes sense, growing up in that that as an adult you're like I have more control over it, so I want something stable and secure and long term."
13656.0,Patient,"Exactly, and now I feel like oh I don't have it again like it's you know all over the place, and I think my with my parents, they live, about two hours away so they're not super close but they're close enough and. I think I hate to say this, but until they're not with me anymore I kind of feel like I want to be around you know, at least in the same state as town and. I think i'd regret it if I wasn't you know life's too short and family's important to me so that's the thing too, and I think he sees that as well, so you know that's another element of that."
705.0,Provider,"Absolutely, and what cove it to its really has closed, you know people to reflect on what's important and those memories you're talking about is, I know you don't have always but it's just like for right now, I want to feel good about my decision and to stay near but not too close."
13656.0,Patient,Exactly.
705.0,Provider,"You get to come and go, as you please it's. Just like yes, you. drop in have Have a nice, you know visit and then you're out of there."
13656.0,Patient,"Right right. very true so and then for him it's different because his dad isn't with us anymore, and his mom. He goes back and forth, he was really close to her and then now he's not really talking to her, because he doesn't like her husband and. So he has a lot of you know disconnect from family, so he doesn't quite understand my. love for family and appreciation and need to be with them and I just i'm very like life is short, I want to spend as much time with them and I don't want them to be gone and i'll be like Oh, I should have. done this with them, or you know that kind of thing so that's kind of where mine comes from and he's not as connected with family or those kinds of things where the coulda shoulda woulda he's just like. he's kind of more comfortable with how he has things."
705.0,Provider,"Right and I was going to ask with when you're talking about your husband and what he wants his his retirement and the future is what are you seeing and what do you want, in your future."
13656.0,Patient,"I think I want stability is really probably the main thing I don't want to be alone I plan to be with him and I think that's my goal. I don't have a clear vision of where that is and I don't think that matters as much to me right now um, but I do feel like I need. some kind of stability and I right now I feel like if I did his thing and went to another country that wouldn't give me the stability that I would be looking for, so to speak, does that make sense."
705.0,Provider,"It does, and especially right now. It doesn't sound like that, right now, with your son here your your parents are here, you want to spend the time that you can and you want to be fairly close."
13656.0,Patient,"Yes, exactly. So, but you're willing, he gets that like I think he understands that's. my way of thinking, even though that's not his, but I think he understands that but I don't know how strong his desire is to really get out of here and. How soon that really feels like because he's he's a type that just talks and it's just like a joke, well, I mean, even with my brother and stuff it's like Oh, he just talks and you're. You can't get a word in and you don't know it's kind of hard to filter out what is real and what's he really going to do or what's he just kind of like spewing out his brain ideas so."
705.0,Provider,What do you.
13656.0,Patient,"Are you watch like walking through popcorn like Where are you know I don't even know so. it's a guessing game for me all the time. I guess that's tough, for me, because I like to wear my heart, on my sleeve and i'll just you know say here's where i'm at."
705.0,Provider,"And, but only for a little bit because I don't like to talk to myself too much."
13656.0,Patient,But I will be honest.
705.0,Provider,"You are really honest about you need the sense of security and stability, you don't care as much about where it is and things like that, but the stability and security is important to you, yes, yes."
13656.0,Patient,That is a goal for sure.
705.0,Provider,"yeah and so, how then. At the time, in your husband and some of it, where he's dreaming of what he wants to do, and some of it is how he really feels and how do you connect and make that where both of you at this time, feel good about it, it doesn't mean that you have to you know okay we're going to do an action. But just having a plan that both of you feel like your needs are going to be met."
13656.0,Patient,"Exactly, and I think that's been the challenge of where is that middle ground of you know, because we would both have to give and take, for that to even be a possibility, obviously so. it's just you know who where we go and the timing and who's gonna you know we both have to kind of find that meaningfulness I think."
705.0,Provider,"Yes, and and it's nice to think about your future, especially when it comes to retirement and then pull yourself back in to today and it's just like we have today, so we can't change, yesterday we have today, and how can the two of you come together today that makes that connection stronger. Yes, it meets both of your needs of where you are in your life right now."
13656.0,Patient,"Yes, i'm very in the moment and I think i've told you, before I don't. goals are a tough thing for me, but um I I like to live in the moment and I always am life is short. And he's always. way far in the future, I mean you know and it's it's hard it's like we need to at least be in the same time zone. You know where are we our time machines are in different places, but um yeah so I, I think we just need to kind of find that maybe myself setting some goals and then him living more in the moment and. not always so far in the future, and because that's hard I that's another thing for me, I like to live in the present because I feel like if i'm living too far in the future. Life started goes by fast and then you regret not doing this or not enjoying that moment, so that's one of my things I really try hard to. focus on now."
705.0,Provider,what's kept you together for 25 years.
13656.0,Patient,"I think we honestly, really, really love each other, he are very bakery and I think we're annoying to other people, at times, especially my son and like. Other people like you, too, I mean I think a lot of people are have wondered like, why are you guys still together, because we are so opposite. But at the end of the day I can't imagine being not with him so that's been hard for me because i'm torn between. If he really had to you know if he's like for myself, I need to just leave here and go. I honestly don't know what I would do because I feel so strongly about being with him, but I also feel really strongly about that's not where i'm ready to take my adventure so. that's a huge thing and for him, I don't know why, or what he how he really feels about why we're still together, I mean there's been so many times, where he's like you're not new, I would normally pick and you know this kind of thing so it's. it's a battle I don't even know a lot of times for me, I think it's probably also comfort, but I, at the end of the day, I really do love him I care about him and I can't imagine not being with him."
705.0,Provider,"And then the same probably it would be nice to hear from him and i'm sure for them to be able to hear from you that this is why i'm sticking through it, this is why and it's. Taking one another for granted, can sometimes happen, especially 25 years and getting back to the basics and you're talking about being that 14 year old girl and having that you know now letting that inner child out that's in the relationship today. yeah vulnerable and being able to say, like this is, this is what I like you know, sometimes with the couple's exercises it's it can be, and it sounds so simple but it's hard, because if you don't have that relationship where you're like hey we're going to do this exercise. Three things three things that you like about me three things they like about you and it's just like Okay, you have them listed or verbalize it it feels awkward. But getting through it it's those simple words of knowing that your mate can still key in three things that they like about you."
13656.0,Patient,"And I bet those things are surprising. Yes, really comes down to it. Right yeah. And I can't wait to ask him."
705.0,Provider,"yeah. And you can you know. Just However, you want to word it and just see if, if this is a place that you you're saying look, I want to work on our intimacy I want to work on our relationship. Then you being able to bring in your style your comfort zone, how do you get your needs met, and you can try different tools and it's like if this doesn't work. Get back into that creative box zone and what's next. Absolutely."
13656.0,Patient,"Very good it's so simple but I it's like you it's like you need to be reminded, keep it simple and don't make it complicated."
705.0,Provider,"It is hard, though I don't want to discount anything heather it having the person you love, even though you love them so much that you can bicker the way you pick her because you're comfortable. But having to say you know, can you tell me three things you like about me it's just like. yeah they get it out yeah yeah or however you feel you know."
13656.0,Patient,"Best yeah. And I those see. Three things would probably be stuck in my mind forever and I would probably go back to those things a lot, and that would be very meaningful for me. to know, and do you know Bobby my mind."
705.0,Provider,"yeah and for him also, even though he may not tell you those things are important. he's probably going through out as weak as they'd like. My wife still find me attractive in this way, my wife still loves this quality about me."
13656.0,Patient,yeah that's true. Very good.
705.0,Provider,"it's you know we speak different languages, usually with with men versus women and it's finding that that middle healthy balance."
13656.0,Patient,"Yes, it's so amazing how different men and women are and it's like i've talked to my girlfriend it's like, why do they make things so hard we're so simple like we get it. And it's just amazing because they're probably saying the same thing about us like how do they not just get it, you know. So funny that. After all these years, and everyone kind of has the same. The same issues in different ways."
705.0,Provider,"Right and for a man that it's more sometimes I don't want to generalize but for some reason it's more of its the physical it's the physical and that brings back all the connection. Well, for a woman and for some it's different you want to first connect you want on emotional on a middle on you know all those things are just holding hands can can you know spark that connection."
13656.0,Patient,it's true.
705.0,Provider,You get the two to be like okay we're gonna.
13656.0,Patient,First.
705.0,Provider,"Right right. Yes, yeah."
13656.0,Patient,"And it's just you know it's kind of one of those things which you know, on a day it's like who's gonna happen first and. it's because we know, I mean he knows that my thing is connect on an emotional level before and I know how his is, and I think when I it's been a period of time, where I haven't had that emotional connection then i'm more. i'm kind of more standoffish the wall is tall, you know i'm not gonna go there and I just don't want to you know."
705.0,Provider,"And, especially if you feel like you're not being heard and that you asked about his day he hasn't asked about yours you harbor resentment that resentment grows in time. until something happens that, then you like that you're like. Okay, I think, just missed that one."
13656.0,Patient,yeah exactly it's like okay reset all right.
705.0,Provider,"Yes, yeah."
13656.0,Patient,it's true.
705.0,Provider,"But knowing this about yourself it's like Okay, so now, I know that this is this is me this is how I navigate through my love life. Now it's like Okay, you get to if this is something you want to work I. Do what you feel comfortable with if it's something that you feel like you know what i'm at the place where i'm going to revisit this later on and revisit later on, but if it's something you want to really engage in more. Go for it bring in the memory box, you know take out the album's do whatever you feel is like going to feel good for you that's going to then present that energy for him to the connection."
13656.0,Patient,that's a good idea photo albums are coming out.
705.0,Provider,Huge you what you need to do heather and if it's the photo albums that brings you joy. Take them down that memory lane okay.
13656.0,Patient,good advice.
705.0,Provider,"Well, you guys have 25 years there's some staying power there right."
13656.0,Patient,"yeah I would hope so, I think, so I would hope that's the case yeah."
705.0,Provider,yeah it is and what I hear a couple of set Becker its thing usually those are the couples that stay around forever because it's the bickering and the comfortable part that is also the loving part of why you feel so comfortable to do that.
13656.0,Patient,"Exactly I know it's true and I feel you know, will do that and whether it's my brother or my parents or my son it's like. they're just in awe like oh my gosh you guys are just so much, and then I don't I don't like to do that with other people around because I know that they feel uncomfortable and they're like but that's just how we are and I. used to be very timid and I wouldn't kind of stand up for myself, but that's, the only way that I feel like I can stand up for myself with him and that's just how we are. And it's not always perfect but that's that's kind of just how it is, for me, and I. Given yeah exactly exactly. So yeah. Perfect yeah everyone's different."
705.0,Provider,And exactly and if you're striving for that perfection and site most days disappointment may settle in.
13656.0,Patient,"Absolutely yeah and I like to communicate and be there and he's not always on that page, but he he's either. Not at all or too much so it's kind of. You know, and I learned to not take it so personal if he doesn't ask about my day other days it affects me more than others where i'm just like. I can't he just asked or but I can't say that to them, because then he's defensive about it, and you know he will make an excuse or whatever, so I. i've kind of learned to be a little tougher skin about certain things because I used to be so overly sensitive and over analyze why he said this, or why you didn't do this or whatever. So I feel like i've improved a little bit over the years, but you know there's just those ongoing things and different things that affect you in different ways that. it's hard, because I don't like to be that oversensitive where things do get to me, but sometimes they do."
705.0,Provider,"Exactly and in those times, if you can relieve some of it before it builds up into a resentment of you know i'm hearing that you don't need to be checked in every day, but sometimes it would be nice throughout the week."
13656.0,Patient,"Exactly exactly and then I don't want to you know ever say that even in a car moment, because then I would feel like it's not coming from a genuine place on his part because it's Oh well, you told me to ask you how your day is and I don't feel like. He really wants to hear about us playing with Lego people or you know, whatever I was doing with my work but um but I like to share with you know that and that's. fun, for me, sometimes, because then he. can see how my day is and how I am and that I really like engaging in that part of myself and it's I finally found my calling like what I like to do, I feel like it's really where I should be and what I should be doing."
705.0,Provider,"Right and being able to when he does ask because you're asking you in the check in when he does ask to quiet, the part that is. Already, you know he's not being authentic he's only doing this, to see if you can also be aware of that to just really just just listen to what he's asking me unable to be be you and not try to judge it not trying to pay place any let you know limits are edited."
13656.0,Patient,"Right yes. make it simple instead of yeah because I have a tendency to overanalyze and you know why he said this, or why he didn't say this and. I shouldn't be doing that because you can't always do things to expect something in return or expect a certain response or a certain reaction. And that's taken me some time to because I I it's nice to have something reciprocated that you give out but that's not life isn't fair and I can't always do that, but sometimes it would be nice."
705.0,Provider,"Right, it is and it's also to that that core filling that you want something, but yet you feel like they're only doing it because you asked for it and working through that and what that means to you and it's like Okay, and part of that i'm hearing us that that drive that. Others needs come first, your need doesn't come first and being comfortable with that and more secure."
13656.0,Patient,"Yes, that's very, very true I. do think of others, first, so there are times, where I probably do things that are not probably the best choice whether it's going shopping or spending too much money. Then that's kind of like myself reciprocation you know, so to speak, because I, I have control over that and that does bring me happiness, to a certain point, and I know that's not the best thing. But at least I feel like it's something that. I am doing for myself and I don't have to worry about someone else and being disappointed, so to speak."
705.0,Provider,"yeah you hit it right there is that the more that you know yourself and the more that you're self sufficient and you bring yourself joy and all these things. Self esteem, is going to come up and that that's going to be to the energy that you present more within your household so it's like the more that you feel good about what's happening and what you've invited into your life. it's going to show people are going to fill it. you're going to feel it."
13656.0,Patient,yeah that's my goal.
705.0,Provider,"I love it I love it you you not only were thinking about it, but you had the courage to verbalize it put it out there, where now it's like now that you've verbalized it. You get to pick and choose you have control over this of what you want to do, or what you don't want to do right right and that's empowering it's like yeah I felt this but, but you know what no more."
13656.0,Patient,"yeah exactly exactly and some days are easier to entertain than others, now, and I think I had mentioned to you before when we first kind of started that my work situation. i'm like because i've been nannying for so long, I feel like that is where I need to be, but I had a couple hiccups with a family that I started with. In earlier this year and I had a really good feeling about them and then a few like a month or two into it, she kind of. Was micromanaging what I was doing and really wanted me to do a whole different field, and what I was comfortable with as far as disciplining the kids and. You know you get them out of the House, even though they say they don't want to go to the park and that's not my thing i'm very like. Okay, you don't want to go park Okay, then let's do this I can roll with it and kind of you know, go on the fly whatever they kind of want to do and she's not that way. So that was kind of a thing, and the kids were really, really difficult and they were you know screaming like I hate you and this kind of thing and. I didn't let it bother me until she was kind of like no they can't have this to eat, you have to do this, and this, and I was really uncomfortable with it and I. Had struggled with telling everyone what would you do, am I, being oversensitive what should I do and everyone's. Like what are you still doing they're like you have the choice to work with them or not, but I also had the drive in me to. Know i'm going to work through this and I want to be there for these kids and I want to kind of be a positive and a different influence for them so. I was really stressed out for a while and then I finally got the courage to I kind of found another part time job working after school with kids with a friend. So I told her that and then she was really upset because she's like I thought you're gonna be with us for a while and it was and i'm just like oh my gosh Thank goodness i'm leaving because this is very stressful for me um. And then she came back to me and kind of was like well you're working on afternoons with your new job, what do you think of just working is there a way we could do just mornings, and then i'll have. Their grammar come in the afternoon because I really like your energy with the kids and i'm thinking this is way different than what you were telling me before. Like where's this coming from and I finally said to her, I was uncomfortable with that chat we had how you didn't like what I was doing like that's not how I am. And she responded with I she kind of like took blame for that, like, I was out of line when you do your thing you're good at what you do I should step back a little. And then I respected her way of i'm not going to be as like whatever the kids want like i'm I. Like the I kind of felt like they were really happy that I was there, and so I kind of felt more confidence and I kind of just didn't worry about you know how the kids reacted or whatever and it's. i'm still with them the two days a week in the mornings and it's so good it's so much better and I don't even know how that all adjusted, but I know a lot of it was. The Confidence came back for me with just me not caring as much almost and then her kind of realizing and stepping back a little it was kind of a you know we met a middle ground so. That was a huge thing for me as far as confidence in what I do and just you know kind of navigating the different families and just the different dynamics. So that was very monumental for me because I. Really low like. I shouldn't be a nanny anymore, and then it went to. A lot of confidence which for me in my life, I never super confident, so I just wanted to share that because that was a very big turning point that just happened a couple months ago."
705.0,Provider,"Yes. I love it and with it too it's just screaming assertiveness assertiveness and you weren't passive you weren't passive aggressive you weren't aggressive. You were assertive and that is like promotes growth and so you've learned from that and yeah you know, sometimes our. Our confidence takes a dive and then there's events in life that happens, and you just run on autopilot pilot but there comes a time where just what you did you brought it back. yeah you brought it back you flip the switch. And now you're like you know what I can do this and i'm going to do it on my terms, but you heard her out to."
13656.0,Patient,"yeah it was really, really great and I. am glad that I didn't just listen to everyone and just leave and like I said I did try and she kind of she made me realize that it wasn't they didn't you know dislike me as much as I thought, and it was very it was a learning experience for me and I appreciated it so."
705.0,Provider,"Right and where she was coming from was probably the projection of something else that she was putting out for to you of what she was going through and it's just like yeah it goes all over the place, and so. i'm glad that you pulled it back in. You were the one there and it's just like look i'm willing to hear you out but here's at the end of the day, i'm going to show up."
13656.0,Patient,"And they um I was very appreciative that they were willing to work with me, because that was not on the table when I first started with them, it was like. No, we need someone here all day, these two days and. They were willing to kind of, say, well, if you can just come a little, and I was appreciative of them kind of giving and taking that way, and I know that they had other nannies that had left, and I think they were just at that point where it's like. Oh, my gosh and so like you said I think she was maybe projecting something that was hard for her and she was probably trying to help me by telling me the things that she does with her kids. That I should be doing but. I didn't take it that way, I took it as you're doing it wrong, you need to do it this way, but probably in her own way she was trying to help, but the kids aren't going to respond to me the same way, they do to mom so."
705.0,Provider,Right.
13656.0,Patient,"That wasn't working for me to you know drive them to the park or whatever, but i'm. Right yeah it's been way better."
705.0,Provider,yeah and I like where you threw into that that's not your style.
13656.0,Patient,mm hmm.
705.0,Provider,"that's not who you are, you have a different way of going about it and yeah you're not their parents are not going to have that like punishment."
13656.0,Patient,yeah I that's exhausting for me to be.
705.0,Provider,Clear like I raised my son he's doing. really well.
13656.0,Patient,I know me me me alone.
705.0,Provider,"Yes, you. do actually it's like hey i'm here i'll work a couple of hours, and you know but i'm glad heather that you said that and that you have that experience now to draw on, and now you can do this, and your other personal life professional life."
13656.0,Patient,Absolutely yeah That was a huge thing for me on a lot of levels.
705.0,Provider,"When you say you know when you respect yourself, or you say something get it out there. Sometimes it's not always well received and that's Okay, too, because you shared what you needed to share and sometimes people have their own vision and that's okay."
13656.0,Patient,"Right and if she would have said okay you're leaving and then I would have known that wasn't the right fit for me and i'm not trying to say that everyone. needs to because i'm willing to go with the flow and you know, not every family's the same they have different practices and that wasn't my thing like we're going to do things my way it was more. They were just very out of control these kids and I was trying to kind of bring calmness to them instead of the you know, like hard thing and I. Like I said it was kind of a mix of I can go enroll with what how you do things i'm not trying to change things, but when i'm here, I do things a little different and if that's the kids are safe and it's not horrible, then you know take it or leave it kind of a thing."
705.0,Provider,"And a different approach both of them may work, but this is what you choose to do exactly mm hmm. Oh that's all good things, and I think again, it just sometimes reminds you, you know that belief in yourself or it's like you know what i'm going to feel good about what i'm doing and and. Maybe i've let some of it go with the flow on some things, but some things stick with you that you're like. This one needs to be addressed, and you did it."
13656.0,Patient,"yeah yeah. And I like I said, you know I don't like to you know talk positive or even talk about myself that much, but that was a big hurdle for me, so I since then i've been kind of trying to. I feel like I do better, when I have the confidence or something is positive, like that, so the more of that I can tap into I feel like I can move ahead even more and it's a clear path."
705.0,Provider,"Right and by taking your healthy risk because had you not taken the healthy risk of of sharing truly what was going on. You wouldn't had that moment you wouldn't have had that experience and it was a growth opportunity for you and for her yeah. yeah that's very you know, we have our own like interpretations of things, or what we like, is it you know preferences and approaches and how do we just you know come together and still make it, because at the end of the day, i'm hearing both of you want the safety of the children."
13656.0,Patient,yeah.
705.0,Provider,Exactly have a different role right.
13656.0,Patient,"Now, and I think that the kids they are responding to it, I mean when I come they're like Oh, she leave I mean I. get a lot of love from them so they're they're totally different now yeah they're still crazy, but I kind of welcome that, and I still. I feel like just being present for them, and if they're upset and they throw their fists and I just give them the time and say hey what's going on and I don't know if that happens with mom and dad so maybe that's. I feel like cheering yeah it's a little it's a different person and it's a different approach, maybe and. yeah and therefore it like I just I love that so it's. All around I hope."
705.0,Provider,"And I think that to me when you're talking about that you light up, I can see it in your eyes, I can see it in your face and it's just like to the core that's who you are as you'd like giving choices you like nurturing that. And that's you know that's a talent and a gift and patients that a lot of people don't have."
13656.0,Patient,"Oh, thank you, that means a lot."
705.0,Provider,"Oh, you know again. What you're doing is so important and for the family, to be able to see that it had to take that conversation, which you were willing to take a risk and say so it's just like it all goes back you know. But doing what you feel like brings you joy brings you purpose it's like all those it's just like bring it in."
13656.0,Patient,"yeah yeah and it's so nice when. I feel like things happen for a reason, and when you can see the reason, because sometimes things happen like what is this and I, there was a time with the situation, I was like what is happening, what I can't believe this but i'm so I see why that happened and it was very good."
705.0,Provider,"Right and that will encourage you, then, to to do that again, and you know just keep building on that, and so, for, for you know what we're doing here, I think you already shared part of of what maybe until we meet again i've just exploring with you and your husband and how you want to connect. got it and when you're ready to implement whatever you're thinking about then do so and let's talk about it and see where you are."
13656.0,Patient,"Okay, that sounds great, are there any act like. Like you said, the three things that you What was it the three things you love about me are the three things."
705.0,Provider,"Go love, or like some people say love, some people say like, but I have to a couple of older couples exercise science."
13656.0,Patient,mm hmm.
705.0,Provider,"I could email you some and then you just take it and put it in your own words, because if you put it in just the words of the worksheets sometimes it comes off as not being authentic and it's just like you're already. making your own."
13656.0,Patient,"Oh, I would love that I would appreciate that I always appreciate the things you send me, by the way, so. I thank you, thank you."
705.0,Provider,"And you're able to review it, I know, last time I sent a bunch but you were just you know going to review some of it."
13656.0,Patient,"Yes, and I have it all here and i'm very visual so I love, like the tangible being able to see it, and you know read through it, I I do appreciate that."
705.0,Provider,"Absolutely, that is what we do here and I wanted to see to heather with your next appointment I don't think we scheduled one for October is."
13656.0,Patient,"Good. I think I just did this one for right now, so if you are able to schedule, one for October that would be great."
705.0,Provider,Absolutely song pulling up is Friday is the best day for you.
