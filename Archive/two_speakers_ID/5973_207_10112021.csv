5973.0,Patient,yeah like children zip lining I don't think it's. I don't think it's anything. To wild.
207.0,Provider,"Oh sorry okay um so how was over, I think it's been a little while I know I think the last time I don't know, I think it was you or I can put our last question."
5973.0,Patient,"yeah they said that you had an emergency with your next to you, I think it says."
207.0,Provider,So yeah.
5973.0,Patient,everything's okay everything's okay.
207.0,Provider,"yeah yeah yeah he got. bitten by a spider but, after a nice emergency room later we discovered it with the fighter."
5973.0,Patient,Oh man. I must have been scary and where he's all right. everything's for for these been pretty good just working a lot and. Even the same old stuff.
207.0,Provider,"Everything. Okay, I know, the last time we spoke, everything is kind of, on the other end or the other thing."
5973.0,Patient,"we're we're working towards things being better it's still kind of awkward for her and I are supposed to have lunch tomorrow so. We you know, hopefully you're just going to be her nice so we'll talk a little tomorrow and. he's you know he's kind of going through more emotional stuff that guy that she had been with that was not treat their well she just found out that he's getting married to somebody else already, and you know she's all about that. She."
207.0,Provider,Did they just break up or did he know they were looking out for for him to be getting married.
5973.0,Patient,"Well, so basically yeah they split up because he had been you know abusing her and basically she was dealing with it, but. She had found out that he had been talking for other women and so she had left him a couple of months ago, and now she finds out that she's marrying one of these women."
207.0,Provider,There was there ever conversation about going into treatment.
5973.0,Patient,"Oh yeah. Well, I told her that I. You know what she needed and then she couldn't really keep asking to be a part of our lives if she wasn't going to take care of her own. You know, like I said it's just it's hard with her, because she you know. her answer to it is Oh well, I am you know I am in truth and. She says that she's going she's talking to somebody you know twice a week and all of this stuff and. I asked her you know if I could maybe go whether the one or be a part of it, you know, there was anything I could do to help just trying to verify that like she has impact going, and you know she won't. She just makes up excuses so like I know that I need to like draw like real boundaries with her and stick to one. she's just it's so hard to there, though, just because she just really does make everything about her and she spends everything so that she's the victim and tries to make me feel guilty and a lot of the time we're. Just. It just feels like it's I hate to say a wasted effort, but it feels like a wasted effort like. she's never gonna get really get better. So she had gone up to my brothers a couple of weeks ago and. You know they swear this is silver which silver was she was there, and all of that so. You know, hopefully, they were right."
207.0,Provider,So. In one was it was recent.
5973.0,Patient,yeah about two weeks ago.
207.0,Provider,Okay okay cuz I know you say your brother or your other siblings they kind of know the the trend and they weren't in a place for willing to do anything.
5973.0,Patient,"yeah and I think with my brother I think it's just more of the same you know, I think that, regardless of what he saw. See you would try to pretend, like everything was Okay, so if you have to deal with it, you know, I think that I think that they're all kind of doing that, right now, just because we've done this thing with her so many times and. You know it's I think they're at the point where they've given up and so they'd rather just pretend like everything's okay."
207.0,Provider,i'm looking at your own. Your chart here don't you have to do a monthly service.
5973.0,Patient,Okay. yep.
207.0,Provider,I have to double check I see here the recommendation and now. I see everything here is quarterly who do you see for.
5973.0,Patient,Dr Jackson. Yes.
207.0,Provider,Everything quarterly.
5973.0,Patient,Recommendation for what quarterly.
207.0,Provider,For. Okay. you've been doing everything. you've been on top of everything with your appointments and all of that. it's recommending quarterly across the board. But I don't know that they do quarterly. MED refill for sure.
5973.0,Patient,How that works.
207.0,Provider,"Okay, so I see that. Your last week, though, was. To. Take."
5973.0,Patient,it's supposed to be to eight milligrams a day but i'm. Taking myself off of them so i'm tapering myself off of them so they're blasting me a little bit longer than they should because i'm taking less every day.
207.0,Provider,cuz I was gonna say the last time I was back in August.
5973.0,Patient,yeah yeah it's probably about right.
207.0,Provider,"So then, she would have not put in our so so your your goal is, and I think we talked about some time ago, like you, we you tried it and you felt like you were going through withdrawals, and I think we had prospects how a lot of it was more mental. Right, then it was just the whole idea of no longer being on it."
5973.0,Patient,"yeah and I think I do really, really believe that that's true I think a lot of it really is the mental side of it."
207.0,Provider,"yeah it is, and not to say that you know, once you start weaning yourself off from any type of medication your body is not going to go to. rage because it's so used to it, but I think the more you you you focus on it, it becomes more of a mental thing than it is, if you do it the right way, if you pay for yourself off. The right way, then you will feel some of it, I think that was some of the when we talked in the beginning, when we first started working together. And you talked about how that some of the withdrawal symptoms that you did experience how you were able to manage it so at this juncture, and at this point. Do you feel that your your ultimate goal is to be off of it completely never have to be on suboxone again is that what you're opening colon. Yes, Okay, and how. On this journey that you've been on how long have you been on this particular journey of a really mean yourself off of it."
5973.0,Patient,But seriously seriously i've been doing it now for like about. Three or four months.
207.0,Provider,"hmm and what. For three or four months, what are some of the if any would process that you've been feeling."
5973.0,Patient,"Well, I just you know stop I just stepped down a little bit more so, like over the last few days i've been you know, having some hot and cold flashes that's the biggest thing that gets to me as the hot and cold flashes and the other part of it it's hard for me is like. When i'm coming off of it it's weird it does like this something to my brain where like I don't want to talk to people like I just want to be left alone. And because my job is dealing with people, and you know it's it makes it hard so like i'm kind of dealing with that, right now, or like I just really don't feel like like talking."
207.0,Provider,mm hmm. And how long you've been experiencing that.
5973.0,Patient,"Probably about two weeks, three weeks it's, not that I don't really want to talk like as far as. Like I don't like feel depressed or something it's like a it's like my brain feels cloudy. You know, like like I don't I just want to be left alone."
207.0,Provider,"I was actually assessing something different, because I was about to say you sure you get a cold in my friend, because cold winter's night see you. Dealing with no."
5973.0,Patient,"No. I believe them for sure, but yeah I mean i've definitely had some hot and cold flashes even be bad. And things get kind of a he, like a I always say to people like the best way for me to describe it is, I feel like like the tin man like, especially when I wake up in the morning, like I need like oil for my joints and stuff. Like I just feel like creaky."
207.0,Provider,"And what are some things that you have. implemented because, and I think this is kind of like one of the things that I thought i'd talk about today is the pause and reflect taking a pause and reflecting on Okay, I know that one of the biggest change is that i'm really working. hard at detoxing myself from the suboxone and working, and you know some of the symptoms, as your deep detoxing and if you if you've been following up with your doctor. You do see your primary regularly or any other doctor any specialist. I think it will help to rule out, you know that there is no other medical anything known medical issues are underlying issues that will be associated So if you know. hundred percent This is all from us weaning off for coming off or taking yourself off of its maximum all of the sentence here dealing with it's not pausing and reflecting and saying Okay, what can I. Implement if I not already in place so number one year you, we are getting older, this is the truth so outside of you detoxing from this. This is, you are going to get up and you are going to feel like I need to sit down in two seconds and get my bearings together from a. From sleeping and getting up so is there an exercise routine that maybe you can implement to help with some of the 18 minutes, maybe in changing your diet, to help you with maybe from a nutritional standpoint, what are you doing anything in that reference."
5973.0,Patient,"yeah i've definitely been you know trying. To make sure that i'm eating a lot of foods, and you know stuff that's been better for me. Exercise you know, I was trying to go for jobs and even though i'm using it's probably as an excuse, I. was just you know, saying that I just did yeah I don't feel up to it but it's probably a good thing to go to go do and it's like I said I don't feel awful or anything I just don't feel good. You know it's like I. feel like I feel like i'm operating it like 80%."
207.0,Provider,"mm hmm and again it's your body i'm putting up a resistance. Like you i've been we've been doing this thing we've had this relationship for a while and now you want to change things up, for me, so your body is putting up a resistance. So while it's putting up this resistance it's still saying okay get your body used to something different. And so, increasing your fluid intake like, whether it be water like from a nutritional a healthy a health standpoint, maybe you're in depending on where you live, your and your wife or your children. could go walking a little bit more increasing your fluid being more mindful, ultimately, it is also coming down to distracting your mind from what it used to because, as we."
5973.0,Patient,said.
207.0,Provider,"A lot of this is. it's it's mental it's really just my routine is getting up and I take this medication or take that medication in comparison to changing insane. weather instead of taking this box and you're just taking your vitamins and being more. Consistent in doing that because sometimes it's just the act of taking something that you also are tricking your mind, not to say that you're going to. Completely rid yourself immediately have those physical symptoms that you're experiencing. But it's changing the routine. Retraining your mind i'm not necessarily taking the suboxone, but I am taking my. Whether it be vitamin and after I take my vitamin I increase my fluid intake like right now you're in Tennessee so it's tough word 90 you drinking caffeine. Near my friend, so the question is how much water are you drinking that day."
5973.0,Patient,Though.
207.0,Provider,"it's probably not a whole lot. So. it's distracting your mind changing in the routine i'm removing this, but what are you replacing it with. And that routine of I remove this it's like a person who is a smoker. And they're no longer smoking cigarettes, so they go and they start doing something different Okay, are you getting the same. calming soothing feeling that the cigarette itself the nicotine was providing no so, then why do you keep it's the action. it's the action of i'm just doing this, but you ain't doing nothing there's nothing in your hand it's the action of doing it so guess what it's a mind thing, so it ultimately comes down to the mind and finding a different ways to control hey. i'm going to replace it by doing something different, because that two milligrams if he decides to only take two milligrams for the day. This is a better example. I don't know if this is something, but like for birth control pills I don't know if your your wife has ever taken birth control pills. i'll give you okay. I can only give you the best example i've only tried this one, because I just. I could I I forget to take pills. So I could never do that. So if you take a pill, and you take this pill every day, but then there comes a period where you're only taking water pills. Water pills clearly is not their youth worker there's there's nothing in it it's not the same hydration it's not what what did they tell you it's the routine of your continuing. So, in your mind if you don't remember that these are actual water pills your mind is telling you that this is a pill to help prevent pregnancy, my friend for one week you're taking a wonder."
5973.0,Patient,"yeah. that's true, I mean, I know I know so much of it is mental I mean, I know, like when I take my medication in the morning, it takes an hour to really start working, but after right after I take it, I feel better it's just it's because my mind tells me I feel better you know I know that it's. it's um yeah I mean honestly, for me the hardest part of getting off the medicine is the mental stuff but physical stops going to stop. Like I know it. You know, but like i'll get through that order that i've you know I did this myself, I put myself in a situation where I needed this medication. No, I gotta deal with the consequences of it, the consequences are i'm going to feel like shit for a while I get that you know i'm fine with that part of it. it's the it's the mental part that messes me up because there's also the little voice in the back of my head that says like. You know what's kept you away from pain medication for so long, you know, like if you get off on that you know, will you go look for the pain medication know and like. rationally, I know that I will not believe that I won't but you know it's I have those fears in there, so I don't you know ever want to go back to that and stuff so. I get the mental stuff is that really the hardest part of coming off of it. yeah because I am so used to wait, you know, taking it in the morning in that."
207.0,Provider,"mm hmm so it's again changing up your routine and and I it's very interesting what you talked about the voice in the back of your head. And so, this is where that nugget and that did that, then you can associate positive self talk to negative self talk. Because like you said, we are mind create the reason for us this negative state of being so you have the positive you and you have the negative use of this negative state of you. is constantly going to give you a reason to rationalize why you need to continue doing this. yo yo mother that you love so much as she keep doing this and you know it's going to take a different level of energy and every I need to be in a different state of mind to deal with her and so that can be well. We know that has calmed you down and that's how you're able to deal with her and her her and fix you know, sometimes when my wife. When she is doing this and you know you know that all of these things are going to come in your mind and if you're always going to justify why you need to do this, and when you think about how to. How can I put this when it comes on to our state of being in our in our ultimate change of our mindset and how we counteract those negative self talk it's knowing that. Like you said number one we didn't older were no spring chicken and so without us being experienced chicken. bacon this is going to be there, outside of what i've done to myself over these years, in addition to that, I am getting older, so when I walk. i'm going to hear a couple of bones popping every now and again when I wake up i'm going to have to straighten out myself outside of what i've done to myself, so this is how I I distract those thoughts that come up. If it is from a medical standpoint, with a chronic pain, if a doctor have already told you, and you know. Michael you could take a pill to manage the symptoms or fourth manage the pain, but the truth of the matter is the particular pain like arthritis for people who have arthritis. You is never going to go away the pain is always going to come about and there's different times are different seasons, that the pain is going to be greater. So I can give you a pill to manage that pain when it comes on but it's learning how to manage it, whether, if you decide not to take a medication to deal with the same time. There is. You know, as as you go through you change and you said you know what I can do it, I don't no longer have to be dependent, even though i'm older."
5973.0,Patient,i'm still young.
207.0,Provider,"and based on your background, it seems like your girls are pretty young and given that your girls are pretty young you want to be there for them the healthy you. As long as you possibly can. And there's and there's going to come a time in their life, where you're going to have to have these real life conversations with them about how to not be dependent on certain things so hey I have to be the living example of what i'm teaching my girls. You get there. And so, this is how you now start talking to this is where the positive self comes in, because. If you get up and you intentionally say you know what instead of taking a pill in the morning and appellant right, I only take it at night so i'm going to push through, and as for a day or two and you say Okay, I know how i'm feeling, but I can get through this. And if you notice that I could get for a whole week by not taking it in the morning for a whole month by not taking in the morning and only taking it at night it's in the same way that you've implemented different coping strategies. And you've made it a whole month it's in the same way you start slowly taking away at night. Eventually, your body is going to have to cooperate what your mind is telling it."
5973.0,Patient,"yeah I mean I can't wait until I found them all, I really care I can't wait to wake up in the morning and not need to go take a pill three that's. that's one of the biggest things that drives me about is I just."
207.0,Provider,"you're off. Yes, so. it's. it's just one of those is taking it one day at a time, and maybe as you're doing it. If you haven't already solicited your wife assistant solicited solicit her assistant to help you through that process. Because, at the end of the day, it's the symptoms that you're treating your take because, ultimately, why do you take some oxygen what's the whole purpose of taking suboxone."
5973.0,Patient,So I don't feel like shit basically. In a. sense so long since the pain medication and now it's just so I don't feel like shit.
207.0,Provider,"you're taking it just to deal with the symptoms. But then. What you're saying that so far, even though you're having a sentence, you have been for a couple of months now learning how to deal with a lot of those symptoms. A lot more manageable."
5973.0,Patient,"yeah for sure, the one thing I really can't figure out what to do about. As the hot and cold flashes like I just. that's what's so hard with those is like I said because I work with people every day, you know and i'm talking i'll be sitting there talking with clients or something and then all the sudden now i'm having a freaking hot flash and you know I. feel like you know if I look like an idiot i'm sure i'm probably pouring with sweat question, for instance clients look at me like this guy having a heart attack or something you know, like I just. The the hot and cold flashes is the biggest thing that I gotta figure out how to better get through, and they don't last long you know it's only you know 10 seconds, or whatever and it's gone I just. I gotta. You know that's The one thing that has stopped me from stepping down a little bit more I think it's the hot flashes just because I I hate dealing with them, and I think a little bit worse word."
207.0,Provider,But you said how long do they last.
5973.0,Patient,All the one they found that only lasts about like probably 10 seconds 15 seconds Max.
207.0,Provider,"seconds, out of a whole 60 seconds, which means in a minute 15 seconds and how often do you get them in a day."
5973.0,Patient,Right now i'm probably getting on. Two or three times in our.
207.0,Provider,"hmm. And so, for the last three months of you coming down you've been going through that."
5973.0,Patient,pretty much.
207.0,Provider,"huh and have you just go, you know its associated with you coming down, but for two to three months of you dealing with this Have you ever. gone to the doctor to rule out any other medical."
5973.0,Patient,"i'm sorry I just I think what the response, then Sarah."
207.0,Provider,"I said for two or three months now, that you've been coming off of it, have you ever won ask Dr Jackson. Is this within the norm of you taking yourself down or is it or have you gone to your primary to explore that there's nothing else medical going on."
5973.0,Patient,"I did go to my yearly physical about a month ago with my primary care doctor and I, you know I told them when I was coming off the medicine and. told them what I was experiencing and dealing with it, and he told me that it was you know all pretty normal stuff and the best way to come off of it was to do it slowly. And you know that there's no rush and in trying to get off with it, and you know that I need to take my time and blah blah blah blah blah. But he didn't really make it seem like it was any really real concern."
207.0,Provider,"hmm so for you it's just more the frustration, or the aggravation of having to deal with it so for you that's just really what it is."
5973.0,Patient,"yeah I mean it's it's that and it's you know I can settle you know i'm sitting there were flying or something trying to close the deal, and you know, right in the middle of talking on your comes a hot flash and next thing I know you know I got. I just. It makes it difficult to my job, sometimes when. When that's going on now hasn't really stopped me from closing any deals know has it really if I had any real consequences from it now, you know I just every time I just deal with it till it's over with. As it is only a few seconds it just it's a miserable few seconds and it's you know, so I know that i'll i'll get through it and stuff it just it does it sucks the whole thing sucks. mm hmm honestly i'm mad at the doctor. That originally put me on suboxone i'm mad at her. Because I didn't know what I was really getting into. and"
207.0,Provider,getting prepared for this part.
5973.0,Patient,"Right yeah I mean you know the withdrawal from the pain medication there's a three to five day withdraw and then you can just suck it up and deal with it, you know you get through it, this this."
207.0,Provider,suboxone is like.
5973.0,Patient,You know at least get 30 days and feeling like crap and then the mental stuff This is like up to six months.
207.0,Provider,mm hmm.
5973.0,Patient,"Okay, just It makes me angry that I ever got on the medication, but at the same time I don't know if I ever really would have stopped with the pain medication if I didn't so I it's a double edged sword, you know work backwards."
207.0,Provider,"Exactly I was just like that it doesn't do you any good it doesn't do any good, because the truth of the matter is. Even though. It is you know, to get on it and to try to come off of it to positive. type of clothing and reflecting it's only going to. make you more agitated make you more effective and that's not really doing anything I think it's just looking at it like. learning how to manage the symptoms ultimately is really learning how to match and even lighten the mood and that's ultimately for you to cold, sometimes it takes lighten the mood. You know, sometimes it's listen, one of the normal natural things that women go through our next lesson. Okay, I am not rushing for that day but it's something. Sometimes and i'm I don't know if your wife can attest to that, after having children, I remember going to the doctor and saying hey listen I think i'm going to Monaco i'm having hot flashes all day. And it was something normal and natural and it is finding away and and I use this example to say. finding a way to cope with in that moment, everybody is looking at you and saying what is wrong with you, why are you acting like that and it's just like i'm just having a moment in life. it's finding a way i'm saying it just so nobody thinks the worst but i'm really telling myself this to help me to get through this moment, because I know why I am going through this moment, so I will say. Whatever it is that I need to to help me get through the moment, especially if it's visible to somebody else. it's always but ultimately it's it's it's. it's a psychological distractions hey you know what i'm having a moment i'm having my moment just give me two seconds i'm just having my moment then i'll be back with you. i'm telling myself that you can get through this by me saying it out loud, because you can visit we see that i'm I am just telling myself this because I need to get I know that this is only 10 seconds or. 15 seconds i'm gonna be all right for sholom be all right i'm gonna be all right i'm going to get through this, I know, eventually, this is going to end this is my internal conversation, but what I say to you, who is seeing me don't worry about me i'm just having my moment not be done. Another person another person might laugh and blah Okay, but then I know within myself, I need to do some form of positive some type of reverse psychology to help me to get through this. Because it's not going to be too much longer of me, putting up with this."
5973.0,Patient,yeah. Things much easier. it's definitely a good way to to address their. Even yeah the same time they'll be telling myself I know it's gonna.
207.0,Provider,"You know what's going to end it again it's the mindset it comes down to the mindset, because the truth of the matter is even though you know if you require. If you're showing visibility of perspiring because, like you said, people, incidentally, oh my God is this guy having a stroke remember this is you thinking that. that's not what the people are thinking, because the truth is there some people just perspire a lot, some people just perspire a lot i'm looking at you. Like my brother he wears passwords galore and then he always has a little thing he paid off that half the man gotta walk with a Reagan in him all the time. gotta clean the head you gotta clean, because he is forever sweating sometimes i'm looking at him like buddy, why are you fighting so much. Why are you so much, and so it's free you know that's what i'm seeing, but the truth of the matter is he just inspires a lot. He just prepares a lot my brother in law, he does too and i'm like buddy it's not that hot, why are you I just need something to eat I just need some need okay. You know the real reason why all of that is happening, but his comment to me is don't worry about me I just need something."
5973.0,Patient,yeah. it's a good point.
207.0,Provider,"it's all about it's The self taught because, ultimately, what you're doing is drowning out that negativity zach giving you a reason cannot fully meet your goal. Your goal is to be at a place where you're not taking this particular pill, and ultimately and you're doing really because I just actually was looking at your your chart and let me tell you something on Michael. I don't have a whole lot of people since you've been in the program based on this this chart. According to is going as far back as October of last year. I have 123. of wanting here you're coming off of actually if this data is right on the 15th will make it one official year since you've been a part of this problem, or at least as far back as I can see these encounters. And you've had for no show. So your commitment to your journey. it's pretty serious right your commitment to this whole thing is pretty serious and even with your no shows everything else has either been. It was cancelled, for one reason or the other. But for the most part, all of. US have one year 12 months you've only know showed consists, if I put it in a consistent basis, maybe for one month out out of the four out of the year, yet you've been a part of the program so therefore you have to pause and. reflect on the meaning of this journey, the meaning on your whole your whole recovery, the meaning as to what have you personally done to stay committed and it wasn't. The suboxone. That kept you going for this last year if i'm just going to look at this chart. It is learning to re evaluate life and it's learning throughout this whole year is the changing of your mindset and re evaluating what is important to you and how do you work through. Life and its difficulties, the physical pain, the emotional hurt the psychological damages all of that, if your commitment to doing that work. That has brought you to where you are today, it puts a box and it was only the symptoms, you were dealing with, but you had in this maximum didn't do nothing, because I have people that are more than you are. and It is unreal. Like, why are you wasting my time in your time.
