For transcription passing checked into the virtual clinic but a minute ago and now has joined this session. Good evening Patrick. what's going on hear me all right."
5599.0,Patient,yep. Sorry i'm a little late.
724.0,Provider,It happens.
5599.0,Patient,Was rushing home trying to get here.
724.0,Provider,don't take any unnecessary risks.
5599.0,Patient,"No, no, no. i've never gotten a speeding ticket and, hopefully, I never get one."
724.0,Provider,"Go knock on some wood, no."
5599.0,Patient,Oh yeah the universe.
724.0,Provider,Good all right well what's what's new and exciting we haven't really had a chance to meet one on one yet outside of the group so. Tell me a little bit about yourself. What your expectations are out of treatment and the sessions are working on what we're looking to do.
5599.0,Patient,"Oh gotcha. let's see where should I start. I. don't know like basically i've kind of been in and out of addiction, since I was a teenager. More or less started when I was 12 started drinking smoking weed because I had dropped out of school at basically in seventh grade and just kind of was yeah just party and. Over time, you know just built up to be more by the time I was 17 I was frickin I would sell weed for a few years already, and. started whatever try and cocaine and stuff like that and. yeah I did that, for a little bit until I was like 1920 and then quit that and just drank for years, probably tell us about 2728 and. quit drinking crap it's been. I don't even I think i've had maybe like two drinks of a beer in the last seven years and that's about it just basically like you know saw beer, I was just like Oh well, that seems you know unique, let me taste it and yeah like isn't the smartest idea for me, but. worked out and yeah about let's see most about four and a half years ago now, like i've always been into extreme sports and stuff snowboard and snowmobiling downhill mountain biking so broke, a lot of bones over the years and. pain level like. 37 years old and back shot shoulders are shot knees are shot and. tried doing physical therapy, to see if I can get the pain just lowered. yeah and it didn't really work at all, so my doctor had ended up putting me on. narcos and started, I just have one in the morning, half a one before bed, and I was good for shit year year and a half doing that and. All of a sudden, you know I asked my doctor hey would it be possible for me to take you know for one in the morning full one at night and then from there, it just started piling and. Three years into it, I was shit taken I don't even 15 to 20 a day."
724.0,Provider,wow okay.
5599.0,Patient,"And just just to maintain at that point, like my pain levels were so out of control, at that point, because, like the narcos weren't even for pain anymore, they were just dependency and. yeah just one day realize like Jesus Christ what am I doing here. And yeah got into a program down in reading will it's kind of weird it's like outpatient program basically down in reading at mercy, you can go down there and let them know hey I got an opiate problem. Basically, they watch you until you're in like full withdraw and then give you your first dose of suboxone and get you started on outpatient. yep so. I was able to do that in July or January 2020 and yeah i've been just the on suboxone sense and yeah still smoke weed but."
724.0,Provider,"Really, the lesser of all evils yeah."
5599.0,Patient,"Right like it's it's always been such a part of my life like 25 years now, and my careers in cannabis too. Because i'm a cannabis grower on the legal market here in California. So it's just yeah kind of hard to get it out of my life when you know I work with it every day."
724.0,Provider,yeah.
5599.0,Patient,"But yeah other than that, like the suboxone I mean for me it's more or less been a godsend like I kept trying to get off narcos and. It never worked, it would be like all right, this is the day and then six hours later i'm freaking out my guys house buying more pills and it's like. Right yeah and with the suboxone yeah I mean I had some urges in the beginning and whatnot but other than that it's been great like the weird thing about it is the suboxone does better for my pain levels than anything i've ever taken."
724.0,Provider,"No well it's because there's no so the way that it works is that there's no euphoria attached to the buprenorphine, which is what suboxone is is buprenorphine, which is an opiate partial Blocker. versus like your hydrocodone owns and actually code owns, which is a full opiate full you know being where you know fill up that receptor. Thinking like a wine glass fill up that receptor and then all the poor over. All the over spillage falls into like that sensitive zone and then that's where the euphoria comes from that's where that's where your high comes from. So what happens is the body is like. cool I don't feel any pain, right now, and I feel amazing I don't my legs broken, but maybe I should go for a run because I can't feel shit and. What happens is the body's like nope the leg is still broken, so I guess, we need another pain receptors so. Another one pops up, which is why what you took yesterday doesn't work like it did yesterday so i'm going to take more to fill up that competent at pores open the body's like we're still injured I don't know what this guys doing, we need another cup and another cut it that's."
5599.0,Patient,A damn.
724.0,Provider,"tolerance and progression constructs it's like. More and more and more, because the reality is that the baseline like your baseline health bar, if you will, like video games it's like. Now you're still injured, we haven't recovered yet, but now you keep stacking all these things on top of it we're never going to get to that point and then eventually. You you you hit a wall or a ceiling and you just can't produce any more receptors, which is why no matter how much you take 2030 pills, like in your case you weren't getting high. But yeah I think that you're getting super sick we woke as those 30 pills into the film of all those cups. And all the way yeah just to maintain."
5599.0,Patient,So what happened was. It was literally basically yeah just.
724.0,Provider,that's exactly.
5599.0,Patient,Just running from the sickness.
724.0,Provider,"To avoid being dope sick, which is when when people finally like the fun is over, you know, maybe people aren't using because it's fun anymore you're using because I can't even get out of bed or function. Like a low level they're like they should, so the butte does it it fills up that COP as a partial but there's no extra so there's no spillage there's no euphoria is the bias and chasing it it it stops you from detoxing because it fills up all those cups like it's supposed to be right. All right, but there's no break down because you get dope sick, because the receptors die and that's why you're sick and as they die you get sick and die and keep getting sick and worse and worse and worse. Which is why, like when that first here drops that that first. Initial dope sick onset people are oh hell, though, and then it goes right back to the top and that's where it stays it stays at that level like right below the surface. in perpetuity until we start doing things about it, so you take the beauty of it fills up all those COPs and everything is cool everybody's happy you're not high anymore, but you're not dope sick or cravings everybody's good. But those are separate still exist. right there still there. So, as you someday when you decide to come off of it or taper down. Your dose gets lower those cups get a little bit smaller there's a little bit of uncomfortableness that I don't feel it's not full blown dope sick I said tell people you're not gonna sneeze and shit your pants you know what I mean it's not you're not at that level. But you're not 100% like you have bad like you're probably like 92 or 94% but functioning and, over time, that becomes your new baseline. That you dropped out a limit or that because you think based on eventually you get back down to normal when you eventually like taper down a protocol, but in your case you're using the beauty as a for pain management, because you have chronic injuries and chronic pain."
5599.0,Patient,Which means we're.
724.0,Provider,"probably going to be on this stuff for a long time right, so it does its job in that respect to where it's not a hindrance it's not. it's not detrimental to your life. it's actually improving the overall quality life and that's what medication, by and large, is you know a lot of people get attached to the idea, like I don't want to be on this thing forever. forever is a long time, you know just worry about today and tomorrow, make sure that you're functioning that you can still get up and perform because you still want to live a productive life. yeah multivitamins every day they take all kinds of shit we take all we supplement our our health in all kinds of ways. This is no different so there's no real negative stigma I don't know if you do, but some people beat themselves up for it it's not worth the effort it's just like. You know I take fishel every day, and what I don't take fishel that's what I noticed that I haven't taken official you know what's about at this point it's like it's. it's part of it. I gotta do it. Right ankles whatever it is so getting. That headspace allows you to free up some of that bullshit. guilt that that we carry over to addiction."
5599.0,Patient,"You know what I mean so yeah yeah for me with suboxone like yeah i'm like with all my family, friends like i'm very open about it, like you know if I got to take my dose then, and you know i'm with five friends i'm taking it I don't care. it's like. You know if you guys, you know, look at me less well you know Oh well."
724.0,Provider,"And it's only because they don't they're not educated on the product and automate those people that tend to poo poo on other people and it's like. But what are you on your on a whole bunch of benzodiazepines every day, just to get out of bed, so you can function like a normal person be like it's not an entirely dissimilar from what i'm doing you know what I mean it's like so."
5599.0,Patient,"yeah The other thing i've noticed what the suboxone like I don't know if it like if it's used like i've done research on it, but mainly just for opiates I don't know if it like helps with like other things. Alcohol and alcohol."
724.0,Provider,does help with alcohol.
5599.0,Patient,"Okay yeah. Because i've noticed because, like ever since I quit drinking like I still have a bunch of friends that are still drink like i'm able to be around them and not drink and everything which you know it sucks, but it is what it is it's life, you know there's always going to be that temptation. But yeah it seems like once I got on the suboxone like my urge to drink was even less than it ever been and. Like with cocaine, I always did that, when I was drinking and it seems like I never get those urges anymore just. Go find some and do it, or something it's yeah it's weird how it just makes me feel more level headed and yeah well."
724.0,Provider,"A lot of that's you too, though, you know what I mean the medication is one part of it. The ability to concentrate in in think clearly and not be under the fog of like a chemical dependency, you know what I mean like allows you. Like that type of insight and because you have come from a place in the past where you're just like. yeah things are crazy and i'm not trying to complicate things any books I don't want to go back There is one other reason why you have the ability to be like yeah it's there it sucks but that's life you don't mean i'm not trying to take two steps back."
5599.0,Patient,So yeah.
724.0,Provider,"For sure the medication helps a lot, but so does your overall mental health, you know currently you know what I mean like that's how. We we say cliche shit and and counseling all the time right it's like healthy boundaries healthy coping strategies and it's like what does that mean does like really just means that you've been. around long enough to know what a bad decision looks like and what it's going to cause long. term right decision. And even if a good decision isn't fun, but you're disciplined enough to be like i'm just going to stick with this, because all the other stuff in the past sucks compared to what this, this is all right, the 20 minutes of being a guy that sucks I can't have a beard. way better than being like. The iris I lost my job I did all this, all this and it's like maturing comes with that you know what I mean. maturity comes with it so."
5599.0,Patient,"yeah cuz That was my biggest thing with you know just basically i've always just called it my addiction jumping from one to the next, like but i'm not addicted to one thing i'm addicted to something else if it's not drugs it's this or that or."
724.0,Provider,My car diving or whatever like.
5599.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
724.0,Provider,"same for. Everybody has a poison, you know what I mean and the easiest and quickest poison because humans are always and have always been trying to find ways to alter the way that they feel think all those things. Whether or not it's sex or gambling or skydiving or whatever is drugs are just the things that we're exposed to the earliest. Right, a lot of us have older siblings or our parents there's alcohol in the House that's why, when we do these assessments and we do a drug history on."
5599.0,Patient,Somebody.
724.0,Provider,"it's almost always the same it's always like the first things that they've ever experimented with was we'd an alcohol, you know 12 to 14 that's like the standard range for that type of stuff and we're like well why is that it's like those are the two most accessible things."
5599.0,Patient,And it wasn't good at.
724.0,Provider,"That it's like oh there's other stuff to let me try that you're not you can't skydive when you're 12 years old, I bet you if you could skydive or do mountain biking or snowboarding all those things like give us that don't mean rush. It would probably do that before they did drugs it's just the fact that drugs are more accessible than some of those things, because you have to grow up a little bit. Before you write some of those things. You know what I mean so it's."
5599.0,Patient,"yeah cuz That was the one of my things with the the whole growing up thing like because i'm a wall i'm diagnosed bipolar like my doctor diagnosed me but. it's weird like it's not on record somehow the way she did it like this was like when I was crap almost 20 years ago. Like she had me come into the office, and this was yeah 20 years ago back in Wisconsin and, like the whole stigma of bipolar and mental illness, back then, where I was from was like you know well, you don't have an illness you're just you're just weak so like. The end my dad was very against it, so my mom more or less asked my doctor to do the assessment, without making it official yeah. And yeah she said, I was severe bipolar and I kind of just like you know, I was 1718 and I was like whatever you know. I don't believe yeah and went on for crap another 1012 years unmedicated and yeah once I finally you know accepted that I have a mental illness and started taking medication like that was a big turning point in my life too and yeah. yeah just really able to. Take that next step of growing up, because it was like well i'm sitting here at 28 drunk party and like i'm 17 and it's like. yeah."
724.0,Provider,If you have manic episodes are you more on the the depressed side.
5599.0,Patient,"Oh yeah I was all over the place, like Fuck I can Stub my toe and my whole week would be shot, like, I would just be angry for days. And then yeah like eventually you know wake up the next day be happy, but yeah it was always just a roller coaster."
724.0,Provider,yeah or.
5599.0,Patient,"yeah cuz like I you know I lost a lot of my friends my family didn't want to talk to me anymore, because it was basically like you know they saw my name come up on the caller ID and it's will shift which Patrick. Today, is it happy Patrick sad Patrick or angry Patrick and. yeah so."
724.0,Provider,it's gonna be work yeah.
5599.0,Patient,yeah exactly.
724.0,Provider,"Okay, so what are you taking to manage that."
5599.0,Patient,takes a telegram citalopram it's a generic selected.
724.0,Provider,For.
5599.0,Patient,"A. I want to say nine years, eight years. And eight or nine years."
724.0,Provider,"No changes in the. cuz like I heard or I hear that, like people kind of like grow out of their medication. Have you experienced anything like that, like where the Africa sees not what it used to be your."
5599.0,Patient,"Know like i've always had a pretty crappy memory so. there's always been like spurts of like six months, where. i'll miss my medication quite a bit so it's almost like my body readjust. Whatever like every time I do like whatever stop taking it or just forget to take it like Am I working too much and just space it out. Once I hit like four or five days after not taking it like my anger is right back."
724.0,Provider,yeah okay.
5599.0,Patient,"And yeah like that's for some reason, like that's always just been my my go to is it."
724.0,Provider,ain't yeah.
5599.0,Patient,"yeah and most likely I my dad was always angry angry and drunk, and so I probably got it from him and yeah I just hate being that person."
724.0,Provider,Right. that's good. yeah so what what's your will double back to the suboxone what's your dose for suboxone Berta.
5599.0,Patient,I do the film strips that eight eight milligram by two or two and three times a day on those.
724.0,Provider,So 24. yeah okay good.
5599.0,Patient,"yeah right the. Like the three at once, like the doctor had told me you're supposed to take it all at once, and like did that for like a few weeks, but I was just. sick."
724.0,Provider,Okay yeah.
5599.0,Patient,"Like just always nauseous and stuff so. I myself just tried to take one you know or three throughout the day and that ever since I started doing that it's been perfect. perfect and and, for me it was kinda like to share with all the narcos I was taking it was like you know every two hours, I was taken something so to have this, you know that three times a day, I think that helps me a lot, too, just because. You know just on my brain thinks i'm doing something."
724.0,Provider,Right yeah a lot of it's like a habitual routine.
5599.0,Patient,So yeah.
724.0,Provider,"yeah well good and i'm a huge fan of the the suboxone protocols anyways because people can kind of manage their day like according to them what works best for them, so I always like that about that that. That medication I worked in like methadone and it was like you know people could only dose between like five and. Like at the latest, like 11am so it's like some people like I don't necessarily need it like this early, but now i'm like this weird routine that I know I start to feel like crap like that two three o'clock in the morning, like it affected their sleep so. I was never really a big fan like that that form of like medication assisted therapy. or right APP but I was like the suboxone because, like like people are like sometimes if I miss like you know, like it's not like, I have to go a whole day I just wait till I get home if I left the House before work, whatever it was so. I felt like it was a like a more mature way and putting the onus on the individual to like managing their life than it was like for us looks like supervising every waking moment for people."
5599.0,Patient,Oh definitely yeah I agree with that I i've had some friends that went that route and it seemed like they you know we're still very up and down in their.
724.0,Provider,"addictions yep and methadone is really designed for people that are like an active addiction and they're they're kind of like one foot in one foot out of. The suboxone like my perception of it anytime that I was exposed to, and I would tell people like they would come in. For like an intake or an interview, and you do they weren't ready and they were shot out, they were still using and i'd like the same for you man like I made get upset it's like well look man. handful of things like this, it has like the least amount of accountability, which means that i'm not going to see you. Every day, like I probably should because, depending on how you look now you probably need to be seen every day and it's like you don't have a job, your couch surfing so i'm not going to pay your rent your own I mean so. Like I was like this medication is for people that have their shit together and that's what I like about it is that most of the people that I know that are on suboxone the by and large, the vast majority of people that i've dealt dealt with. They pretty much have their shit together and they just have typical hang ups or come from a place where they've overcome the worst part of their addiction and now they're like until like the rock and roll like moving on getting out there. which I like I find to be quite a inspiring you know, if you will, so it's good."
5599.0,Patient,"That was the one thing with the Narco is like all my other addictions like they completely controlled my life, you know. From the minute I woke up to the minute I went to sleep and. Like what the norco is like my main thing with just controlling my pain was so I didn't miss work ever so I was. able to you know started working like 1415 hour days just go go go and yeah. Like yeah I have my own place car has like tons of toys like i've you know, been successful for quite a few years now, which is frickin nice comparative to the first 28 years of my life and. yeah."
724.0,Provider,I saw that how it works so that's how it's supposed to work like if you were like a kid you not I mean that mindset having the kind of success that you have right now you'd be a mess.
5599.0,Patient,You know you'd be oh yes.
724.0,Provider,yeah so.
5599.0,Patient,"yeah the money, I have today, back then, I don't think i'd be here today."
724.0,Provider,Exactly exactly.
5599.0,Patient,But yeah like. My main thing is just more or less like. Stopping the jump in as my biggest thing is what i'm after is finally finding that you know point where I can just keep going and not try to find something else to make life easier for me. Right like so he's gonna be you know difficult it that's what life is so. it's just yes.
724.0,Provider,yeah life is suffering.
5599.0,Patient,yeah it's just how you handle it and move through it.
724.0,Provider,"yep there, I saw a quote from Frederick Nietzsche he was like a German philosopher existentialist kind of guy and I don't the translation was right, but somewhere along the line where it's like if you haven't learned anything from suffering, then you haven't suffered. Which is like a fun way of saying absolutely nothing. Right, you always find like these cool quotes where it's like yeah sometimes it does sometimes it doesn't it's like. You pretty much told me nothing. You know right like at one hand this happens, on the other hand, this happens, so I don't know and it's like so truly like like all we know is like to a certain degree, is like how to be uncomfortable and then developing ways to not be uncomfortable anymore, and whether. resiliency or attrition or you know escapism whatever it is, but those that those paths are there for us like it's human nature to always try again try to change the way that we think or act or feel and because of that. Sometimes we develop negative consequences, but because of that we are where we are today, you know, nobody else on this planet. X, like us, thanks, like us, behaves like none of that stuff like and it's weird you know what I mean like so the easy scapegoat would put it all together, like religion, but if that's the case like, then, we have all these other things that don't make any sense. yeah it's like so for sure evolutionary like like some of our hang hang ups have benefited us anxiety has benefited as it's kept a sharp. You know, depression has benefited us because it, it allows us to hold on to crucial memories and cherish people when they're here longer and like it's like all these negative things have underlying positive traits to them are the see, though sometimes but it's all interesting."
5599.0,Patient,"Solid yeah it's. Definitely is like you know when I was a kid and finally became an adult and everything and look back, it was like. Always thinking about well my parents know you know they know best, or they know what they're talking about and it's like here I am at 37 and it's. Like shit I was 13 when my mom was 37 and it was like Fuck I thought you knew everything it's like. You didn't know shit you're. just trying to figure it out like me."
724.0,Provider,"yeah, which is why, like you, like a lot of us will give our parents passes for being like bad parents are like now what we thought they should have been like the older you get you're like Oh, I get it like I get what a 17 year old mom. is right, like I couldn't imagine what that would be so it's like you get a pass and a lot of things you know, hopefully you're a better person now you've learned to but uh yeah I think Joe rogan had that joke you familiar with Joe rogan the comedian."
5599.0,Patient,Oh yeah.
724.0,Provider,"yeah yeah that joke about same thing, it was like you think like your parents know everything and then one day you're standing in like. The supermarket i'm paraphrasing it and they call you like Mr rogan you're like wait what it's like. right on parents age you're like I don't know shit like you said it's like I don't know what's going on up 39 and i'm like i'm still learning stuff and i'm like I don't know I don't know I don't know what I want to be when I grow up you know it's like. yeah we're always chasing that that what if scenario and trying to expand our understanding of life and it's it's just what it is man."
5599.0,Patient,"yeah like i've learned to appreciate that and kind of embrace it instead of it, you know when I was younger, it was always a fear of mine of where my life was going and now it's like. Just try to go with it, and where it goes it goes and i'm beth just try look forward to whatever's next."
724.0,Provider,"Right yep and that that helps with like anxiety because the anxieties like fear of the unknown like we all have that. And once you start to embrace that chaos, a little bit it gets a little bit easier. to happen, but. we'll see. I will be messing so it's good so you have like a you like in a stable relationship, you have kids or anything, or you."
5599.0,Patient,"Know kids got a girlfriend we've been together a little over two years now. She that she has two kids. But yeah good relationship crap I think we've been in I think like one actual argument and the five years we've known each other and i've been together for over two of them and yeah we just get along really good, which is nice because. Every past relationship was my of mine was just frickin chaos and just hell."
724.0,Provider,yeah. You I live together or.
5599.0,Patient,"A no not yet like we plan on it, but yeah like we just kind of go back and forth like I stay at her house couple two three days a week, she stays at my house two days, three days a week, and yeah yeah."
724.0,Provider,And how old are the kids.
5599.0,Patient,A seven and nine okay.
724.0,Provider,Good age.
5599.0,Patient,yeah yeah they're good kids they they seem to like me so.
724.0,Provider,"yeah you just got to be consistent and, obviously, like like earn earn your boundaries, you know at that age, like a lot of it's like on them to fold you into like their life and stuff so. yeah your job is really just to be consistent, you know I mean I saw their kids that age and really just looking for is like consistency so."
5599.0,Patient,yeah yeah cuz like I never wanted kids and like I always tried to you know date girls that didn't have kids but yeah I ended up meeting her and yeah you know things change and yeah.
724.0,Provider,"yeah yeah it's uh. yeah it's the biological imperative for for all of us to you know have kids and live forever that's kind of like the idea, but they do have a way of like improving your."
5599.0,Patient,Your overall quality of.
724.0,Provider,"Life surprisingly, maybe not so much in the beginning, because it's like a lot of work in the beginning, but like like they really do so it's kind of cool it's kind of cool."
5599.0,Patient,"yeah I just I really like seeing the just the excitement and. The just the happiness of life, and you know the. Well it's hard to say like because you just don't get those moments as an adult you know that first time you get to do this or that or go here and yeah yeah."
724.0,Provider,All the new stuff is old old.
5599.0,Patient,"yeah yeah. yeah so it's it's Nice, seeing that and yeah putting a smile on their face and yeah yeah cool."
724.0,Provider,"Alright, so So work is good relationships are good medications good any medical issues outside of like just being like banged up and stuff do you have like any other like high blood pressure, any kind of like like significant concern."
5599.0,Patient,"And now, not that i'm aware of, or anything like I definitely need to. Go to the doctor and do some of those you know 30 year old and older stuff."
724.0,Provider,yeah annual checkups.
5599.0,Patient,what's up.
724.0,Provider,You have any primary care doctor.
5599.0,Patient,"I do not at the moment, like. It was kind of weird like the doctor that was prescribing me the narcos like when I got when I want it off the narcos. I asked him, you know, can I do to the suboxone treatment, through you, and he didn't want to do it, he basically just kind of all you're not taking the narcos anymore all right bye and it's like. Okay. And yeah."
724.0,Provider,"Probably better that way, maybe use a trashy doctor. yeah. So I encourage a lot of people, especially within this age group to get a primary care physician. Somebody that you like that you can communicate with."
5599.0,Patient,Because you.
724.0,Provider,"want to carry that relationship for a while, because, as we get older we start picking up hitches and our step. in certain places, so you're going to want to have like it like a like a good continuity of care and your medical chart so it's just like Okay, this is kind of when things really started the. occurred, maybe, and then that way you can avoid having the wheels fall off late later down the road so like a strong continuity of care in your medical history is. super important, especially at like at our age, you know I mean so we're still pretty young, but you know we're not so young, that we can't develop you know some debilitating stuff so it's important if you have insurance you paying for it, you might as well get plugged in with a provider. You don't have to say, all at once a year. You what."
5599.0,Patient,Okay.
724.0,Provider,yep yeah.
5599.0,Patient,"keeps calling me i'm going to text a real quick yeah. So it stops calling it keeps me in my stuff. What was I gonna say. let's see. But yeah like with my family like I definitely need to find a doctor like males in my family uh. Most of it, like my grandpa he's the only one that I know all my dad just turned 60 and every other male once they hit 60 it's just all downhill if they're even still in my family so. it's one of those things you know we got bad hearts high blood pressure, throughout the family and yeah."
724.0,Provider,"you're gonna want to. follow up with that because, like a lot of like a lot of blood pressure stuff if it's caught early. You know, because they have categories right it's like like class to class whatever it is, so if you can get in early and identify it sooner. You know, they can give you some medication, or you can change some things holistically and drop it down and then you can worry about that stuff like later down the road like as you start to age out but. Right eating right, you know, taking care of your body and try to be as healthy as possible will ward off like high blood pressure and stuff because eventually that like bleeds strokes and heart disease and. Right other things so."
5599.0,Patient,"That was one thing I keep forgetting to ask the doctor about it, too, I don't know, maybe you would know, like the. graphic where chantel we had did an assessment for add. Because when I was a kid I was told that I was add and my dad you know once again being who he was on my kid doesn't have add blah blah blah. yeah like you know, as I got older like I just learned to work with it like you know, like if i'm on motivated or I can get up to do this, like. There was times, where I would literally have to tell myself 1000 times like just get up and go and like i've always been a fidgety person I always got to have something going on, or shaking my leg and. So, after the assessment, she said yeah that i'm add severe add or whatever and. Since i've taken the adderall like i've noticed my eating habits have changed and like. Just kind of the some of the stuff i've done over over the years of my life like i've always been a late night eater and i'm not anymore like I used to eat like fucking five course meals at you know one in the morning. I don't even do that anymore like I have more of a normal eating schedule and it's like I don't know if that was just my add at the end of the night when I started getting tired just trying to keep me, you know doing something."
724.0,Provider,So I just eat.
5599.0,Patient,And yeah cuz she said i've lost 38 pounds since going on the adderall and. Like like five months.
724.0,Provider,that's awesome.
5599.0,Patient,yeah I was like oh like.
724.0,Provider,"What was your. What was your sleeping habits before, though, like if you were staying up till like one o'clock in the morning and then eating pretty heavy like did you sleep later in the day, like your circadian rhythm What was it like."
5599.0,Patient,You want a.
724.0,Provider,Night person or a morning person.
5599.0,Patient,"Oh yeah. way more of a night person like I mean like because, with growing cannabis like it's always better to run the rooms at night so then you're not you know, dealing with the heat of the day, or the sun. You know so most of the time you know, like when I have to do stuff in the rooms it's I usually start at seven o'clock eight o'clock at night. And then, sometimes i'm work until one two in the morning, so i'm usually in bed like three in the morning and then up at 11."
724.0,Provider,"Alright, so yeah I mean your your your shift is or your life rotation is slightly off right, which means that if you're eating at one that's typical for. You know it's typical for people that stay up late anyways you know because it just means eating breakfast later in the day, like your first meal is later in the day than everybody else's. Which launches probably closer to what everybody's dinner is and then you know your dinner is around the time people are sleeping and then maybe snacking like. Like most people will you know snack a couple times and i'm the same way, like but i'm a night person easily fall into like the night routine when I was in the service I work third shift the entire time that I was there, outside of like basic training and shit. And to me years to get off that cycle and then recently before I started this job. I went back to a third shift job and I worked there for two years in the hospital, it was like I fell right back into it and now like. Tonight, when I get get off here with you guys, I have one more session and I won't go to bed until like three o'clock in the morning and it's already it's almost 11 o'clock my time."
5599.0,Patient,Oh dang.
724.0,Provider,"i'll go over now he you know to me and i'll try to sleep until about nine or 10 you know I get seven hours of sleep so like people like you like, like me, like we're just naturally fall into that sleep cycle state. The Admiral probably helped you correct your diet and your pie burning more calories as a result is a stimulant the right so that's probably that and you're probably not eating. As much which then will again decrease like caloric intake well, then the weight will fall off and if you're busy, like all those things kind of play into a factor. So it's it's always hard to be like it pinpoint one thing."
5599.0,Patient,is being like right.
724.0,Provider,"You change unless it's like a car accidents like that's all the car got broke up, it was car accident like not like a systematic thing over time where things are happening so. Right. yeah."
5599.0,Patient,"yeah just having a more normal schedule and yeah well normal to me, I guess, not normal to everybody else but yeah like my Fijians way, alas, my girlfriend says my memory is night and day different and. Just a lot better, which is. i'm happy cuz then she doesn't get upset with me for. Because horrible with the little things."
724.0,Provider,"And what's weird and like i'm not a mental health professional I do co recurring issues and a lot of times it's like depression, anxiety trauma, which is you know people use drugs, because sometimes they have those issues like the big three or. develop the big three as a result of their drug use. So, like that's about as like the extent of my stuff like I don't know, like the the psychology of Depression and anxiety, I know, like just enough, you know what I mean that kind of reel it in."
5599.0,Patient,Right.
724.0,Provider,"But what I do know is that or what i've learned recently is that odd diagnosed childhood add is hard to diagnose a dd or ADHD and adults, because it. The symptom ology of it is Depression and anxiety. Right like like I can't focus and it's like well why it's like because now you have all these other again all these other things going on, so you can't pinpoint it where it's like well I gotta work. Late my rent my girlfriend's pissed off at me and I don't know if my car is going to start and more it sounds like all these other things are really masking the fact that you can't process Depression and anxiety. Appropriately because your attention just cannot stay with it because you're just stretch real thing and I read this. I was like that's very interesting because some people are probably overdiagnosis anxious or depressed when they're probably attention deficit if they if they roll that out if they're if they identify medication potentially a lot of those stuff falls away right. Right Okay, and so it'd be like oh you're anxious, you know or you're depressed take this mood stabilizer and it's like maybe it's not that maybe that the core issue still exist and we're just treated missing, just like we did in addiction, a lot of times the argument is like. If we could address why people are depressed maybe they won't use drugs anymore, but instead we always address the drug use first and that takes forever. You know yeah you get to the root cause maybe they won't be the drugs anymore so it's like all these schools of thought so."
5599.0,Patient,"Who knows yeah cuz I want to say her name is amy my last counter when I brought it like some of the stuff up to her like. Just how my life is and some of the things like because i've always had doctors, you know, since I was a kid well around 17 they're like it's just anxiety and depression and you know so. I just completely forgot about add, and you know just learn to cope with all the issues and when I brought it up to her, she was like basically I laid them all out and she's like your add and i'm like. Like there's no way like and yeah when we did the assessment, it was like. Because a another thing when I started getting on the adderall like I used to smoke weed from when I woke up so when I went to sleep just to keep my brain that. Like and. I don't even use it in the day anymore I just use it before I go to sleep just to help me fall asleep and yeah it's you know so like how you were saying like maybe you know that was one of my bigger issues you know, but that was really driving the bipolar and the mood swings and."
724.0,Provider,"could have been the core issue that caused all the secondary and tertiary concerns like and. A lot of times that sort of this and that's what i'm finding out more because it's one of the first things I asked people now when they're like. I do these assessments a lot now for it and i'm like history of depression, anxiety like yeah i'm like. What about concentration and childhood you ever been how was your learning learning when you were in school any issues in school behavior attention deficit or like yeah it's horrible in school, like my grades suck and it's like nobody ever talked to you about that."
5599.0,Patient,yeah see I was like or my or my dad didn't believe it's like.
724.0,Provider,"Right, maybe, maybe."
5599.0,Patient,"I was. That kid in school and like fifth grade and the teacher, would you know going on with some story and then all of a sudden i'd be the kid that just yells out a lot of noise or whatever like yeah I could just never stay focused and. Just track."
724.0,Provider,Part noise or something like that.
5599.0,Patient,Oh yeah. The slam my dad skirt.
724.0,Provider,"That stuff man, I think. The onset for that stuff really shows itself in childish behavior you can really tell a lot about kids. Whereas an adults like yeah you probably should be anxious about these things that you've got going on your life, you probably should be depressed or your girlfriend dumped you and. And now you're flat broke and you're sleeping on your best friend's couch and it's like yeah man, you should you should be all these things, but when you're younger kids don't they shouldn't be anxious and they shouldn't be super. depressing because they're not gonna deal with those variables. that's why I, like the identifying with like add is super important because it may be a precursor to like bigger issues down the road that if it's left unchecked it's going to create like just a world of shit for that person."
5599.0,Patient,yeah.
724.0,Provider,we're all the good old so.
5599.0,Patient,When I was a 1415 like my anxiety would be so bad at times like I would literally pass out standing up like mid conversation just. yeah chest pains did he sweat and then black.
724.0,Provider,yeah you're out yeah.
5599.0,Patient,"yeah and yeah first time that ever happened that was yeah just came to and surrounded by my friends and I was like. The hell is going on, why are you guys all around me like."
724.0,Provider,"it's a funny reaction, the first time I got choked unconscious that's what I was like what I came to, and I was like Why am I, on the floor i'm up and they're like everybody's like. Sorry."
5599.0,Patient,"I realized what happened, I was like this sucks."
724.0,Provider,yeah.
5599.0,Patient,yeah all right.
724.0,Provider,"All right, Patrick was good getting to know you a little bit um you go to group once a month that's the deal."
5599.0,Patient,Every two weeks.
724.0,Provider,Every two weeks are excellent yeah um so and I think how often do you do in the visual sessions that once.
5599.0,Patient,I was doing them like once a month. But uh I think they. When I was talking with compliance they set up me up for a second one this month.
724.0,Provider,perfect.
5599.0,Patient,yeah Thursday yep the 21st same time.
724.0,Provider,"Good yeah most of the people on my caseload that I got from amy I believe um I see him twice a month and depending on. Like how the conversation goes i'm not the type that's going to drag people out for like an hour, because I have to like i'm not on. Any other or any real obligation to drag your conversation out to an hour, if I can get what I can get within 15 minutes you know, sometimes like sometimes there's nothing really to talk about and we're just standing there like. Right, you know what I mean, so it doesn't benefit anybody people talk when they want to talk and you know they get their therapy and all that kind of good stuff so. So yeah twice a month because I keep it keep it solution based like if you got no problems going on for hit the finer points and then we'll keep it moving, but you know, sometimes like sessions around longer than an hour, because I got real shit going on, so. I don't like time spent so I didn't like and in college when they're like right this 20 page paper i'm like. nope you're going to get as many pages that I give you. Where I feel good enough like you know what I mean, so I don't like constraints or restrictions, I do, what I want to do and that's like the most efficient. that's pretty much it. So we'll meet up here a couple weeks and and. we'll see how life is going at that point cool."
5599.0,Patient,cool cool.
724.0,Provider,man.
5599.0,Patient,yeah you do appreciate it. Have a good night.
724.0,Provider,"For transcription That was our first session with Patrick McCarthy, I believe. A rapport building session, he has a follow up with me in two weeks and have been group. That week as well, no further action."
