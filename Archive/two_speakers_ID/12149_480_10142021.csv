ID,Role,Message
480.0,Provider,"Hello. hey sorry i'm a few minutes late, I tried wrapping up that session 15 minutes ago I should. Start earlier."
12149.0,Patient,yeah it's chill I know what it's like to be in the middle of something when it's at one sending.
480.0,Provider,So how's your week been.
12149.0,Patient,pretty good yeah yeah it's been okay yeah.
480.0,Provider,that's good to hear. What made it okay.
12149.0,Patient,"So, on Sunday sorry, let me get situated on Sunday, I started a new dose of lamictal I went from 50. yeah um, but I think my psychiatrist was confident because I hadn't gotten like a rash or anything so he was like it's it's safe to go here, we were going to do 100 but I had like I told him that I just had like this low grade depression. I was bothering me and so he. He was like okay that makes me want to put you on 200 because that's like the therapeutic dose where it's not just preventing future depressive episodes it's actually helping current depression. Oh i'm so."
480.0,Provider,So I just still for lamictal that's still a pretty low dose 200.
12149.0,Patient,Is it.
480.0,Provider,I don't know that's why i'm asking you.
12149.0,Patient,"Know Okay, so it seemed like it was a pretty high dose in the sense that you start to feel the effects."
480.0,Provider,um got it okay.
12149.0,Patient,"Because before it was just mellow side effects, like my dreams are so vivid and so like long I remember them all."
480.0,Provider,In a disturbing way or.
12149.0,Patient,"i'm yesterday I did have one nightmare that like I wanted to wake up from, but most of the just like weird and interesting. yeah um I do dream about my best friend my best friend a lot."
480.0,Provider,um.
12149.0,Patient,We were really close from kindergarten. Up until when I was like 26 and had like a really serious manic episode that was like kind of psychotic.
480.0,Provider,yeah I remember you told me about that and then she just kind of like was done right.
12149.0,Patient,"yeah she was basically like like when some some of our mutual's would talk to her and be like she's you know your family like I was really close with her whole family. And I basically grew up at her house like I was there, so much. And she was like well she got abusive which is fair, but they were like you know she had like a serious mental health. issue."
480.0,Provider,or her right mind she wasn't intentionally harming you yeah.
12149.0,Patient,"yeah and they were like it's incredibly uncomfortable to experience that, but it was like definitely much worse for her to be going through it herself. And like a one point I reached out and she sent me a sweet message like you know I i've never felt so connected to anyone like I dream about you all the time. and I was like I didn't feel good that you. cut me out when I was most vulnerable. And like. There was this group chat that was. like this group email that people made about me in order to like help me but I wasn't invited to it and it just felt like when I was the most paranoid everyone that I loved was talking about me and I didn't get to know what they were saying. and basically the Ashley when you're experiencing paranoia already that can just amplify everything. yeah it was so intense for me and basically like in the end, no one really wanted to help me with finances or a place to live or. Even like talking to me or connection. But they did. They were willing to pay for me to go to rehab. Like drug rehab i'm like I was doing a bit of drugs but. That wasn't. That cause."
480.0,Provider,yeah well that's why I was gonna say it didn't sound like from your history that that episode was directly linked to drug use that was more related.
12149.0,Patient,"yeah I mean I had to go back home with my mom for like a week or whatever and. Like I had no money like I didn't have any drugs anymore, and I didn't have any withdrawal symptoms and I wasn't like. Finding or. trying to get more anything like. It was yeah I was using it to cope. yeah um and. Like my mom has done this before, when I was like 17 I had another manic episode and I was acting really strange cutting people off talking really fast. And lost a lot of weight both manic episodes I lost a lot of weight and i'm pretty slight so it's really obvious when I lose a bunch of weight. i'm like to go from. i'm like five seven people are like each."
480.0,Provider,Big deal.
12149.0,Patient,"So they offered me to go to drug rehab and I was like that's not the right place for me in retrospect, I should have just gone, because then they would have been like. This is a mental health crisis she needs a psychiatric hospital and."
480.0,Provider,They would have sent me somewhere else the rehab would have yeah. yeah now at the time.
12149.0,Patient,"I didn't um and I really was asking for like. Like not like a life coach was, which is what I used to have but, like a perfect mental health professional. But nobody was willing to help me pay for or even helped me get on insurance like I or I had insurance, but since I switch counties I didn't have access to it, and it was all just too much like I could barely read if that makes sense. Like things were just blurry and my retention wasn't there. And I was just spicy so anyways I dream about her so much even seven years later."
480.0,Provider,So you've had no contact in seven years.
12149.0,Patient,"No, we did email like a little bit like a year or two after that. And then I sent her something in the beginning of this year. And I was like just an update like I did get a diagnosis, I have been on medication like I finally know what it is, and I told her, I was bipolar and. And I was like I. I really miss you I think about you all the time, but. Like if you don't respond to this, I stop reaching out, you know because I don't want to like. it's good to help people when they're mentally ill, but it's also good to have boundaries and i've. made boundaries in our House to. With people so but it just sucks because, like, I feel like myself again and, like we're incredibly close."
480.0,Provider,"And that's what sucks is, you know that you in this state you guys would still be good."
12149.0,Patient,yeah right so that was me.
480.0,Provider,That makes the grief part so much harder because. it's like well you're not even giving me another chance and i'm back to me.
12149.0,Patient,With yeah. yeah.
480.0,Provider,really hard.
12149.0,Patient,"And it was like a 20 plus year very close friendship. yeah um so yeah I used to like dream about my mom like abusing me a lot. But now my dreams mellowed out I don't really have nightmares anymore, but she's always there. And like in the dream were friends."
480.0,Provider,Do you think about her daily.
12149.0,Patient,"um. I mean not in the same way, were used to where I was really upset about it and felt betrayed and but like. A lot of things remind me of her. yeah like music and fictional characters and. But I don't live like anywhere that we've lived together. Because we move. yeah she moved somewhere random like Maryland or something for her freshman year of college and she was having a tough time feeling really isolated and it wasn't really her scene and I was like come to Santa Cruz. yeah that's awesome. Like she came out to me, I was like hell yeah like me like she was so nervous to tell me that she likes girls and I was like saying like i'm by you know there's gay people here come to gain I."
480.0,Provider,hang out.
12149.0,Patient,"The beach and the mountains and so beautiful so she did when she was 19 but and she said she's still there. Okay, but when I had my mental health crisis. In when I was like 26 I think I moved back home, which was very triggering. that's where I sit and had an episode that's where I thought my you know homeless boyfriend or whatever like."
480.0,Provider,so hard.
12149.0,Patient,Everything um so.
480.0,Provider,yeah though to right.
12149.0,Patient,"mm hmm. yeah but they're like just partners apart like Santa Cruz to and then like I finally got my shit together enough to move to the bay area. I live in Berkeley which is next to San Francisco. And yeah. And she we've never lived here together but i've also never returned to Santa Cruz, and I was there for like a decade. interesting."
480.0,Provider,Maybe I was doing want to go back.
12149.0,Patient,I really missed it. Like there's there's things that I really miss and like I would love to show the people in my life. Around and like but i'm also scared of getting triggered there. And more so i'm scared of running into her and.
480.0,Provider,that's what I feel like anytime you go back to somewhere where there's not closure with people you're constantly hypervigilant thinking you're going to run into them.
12149.0,Patient,"Right yeah yeah. Part of me wants to one run into her like I, I do have this sort of fantasy of like being stuck in the same place, and like forcing her to interact with me. Because like she's very passive like she's a nine and then he Graham like she really prioritize his peace and relationships. And like if there's conflict, instead of dealing with it she'll just zone out and like read a book and do something that's calming for her so to reply to one of my messages that could potentially lead to me being aggravated with her is probably very low priority for her. way like just probably terrifying because I can get angry yeah."
480.0,Provider,"Any grams, you know."
12149.0,Patient,"i'ma to with a one weighing. yourself pres to. So I get really weird when i'm super unhealthy of like you've never done this for me, you should I did everything for you. You know it's not cute."
480.0,Provider,"funny how I always say like my unhealthy. When i'm unhealthy team i'm an aquarius zodiac wise right. But i'm only in aquarius personality wise when i'm unhealthy like and same with any Graham it's like all of the bad trades i'm uh. i'm like split, seven and eight like totally equal so they change back and forth between like which one has which one is it swing you know, but when i'm unhealthy then that's when it's like all the bad character is takes of those."
12149.0,Patient,Any Graham like madden.
480.0,Provider,ADB exactly exactly.
12149.0,Patient,"yeah I just think it's so funny i'm like I only fit that when i'm unhealthy. mm hmm my mom's in a with a seven wings and like when we're healthy we work so well together, like she's in charge i'm right there meeting her every need like we're very productive like we've definitely had moments on the farm where we were like we landscape, the whole. Mountain today. Like we're growing so much. yeah. um so that sucks like that we we can't be that together anymore, but um. yeah I think about my friend, a lot. yeah I don't really."
480.0,Provider,ever have like a really sexual relationship with her and never crossed the line.
12149.0,Patient,"No, I mean like. There were a couple girls, that we are both interested in. Who like wanted to have a threesome with us and we were both like oh."
480.0,Provider,Like really about would be two weeks. Well cuz like you said it's like your sisters almost.
12149.0,Patient,"yeah we were sisters. yeah um and yeah i've never had a breakup that was this hard like even with my parents. yeah um. So. it'd be nice to. dream of. yeah so nice to see her too, but it makes it feel like it's so open and. Then I have this thing, where I wake up and i'm like. Oh yeah I can."
480.0,Provider,Reality hits.
12149.0,Patient,"mm hmm. yeah yeah so that's one kind of thing that's tough about having such vivid dreams, with my psychiatrist said that it will only last a few months."
480.0,Provider,"yeah What do you do with that, like in the morning, when you wake up with this realization that oh crap it was just a dream we're still not friends like, how do you process that emotionally do you do any intentional grieving."
12149.0,Patient,"I like to lay really still with my eyes closed in the same position and kind of think about my dream um it's fun. To pick apart, all the weird little aspects of it at times in my life i've even written my dreams down."
480.0,Provider,dream journals are fun to look.
12149.0,Patient,"At yeah yeah i'd be like Oh, these are some of the themes. And I kind of take like her theme, I kind of feel like is just like she represents like friendship and safety to me. Like we could tell each other anything, and we did, we would like go on hikes and just be like blah, this is everything with me. Is what I don't like about our relationship, this is what's going on, like health wise anything. yeah i'm."
480.0,Provider,"Part of why you're still grieving that loss so much as you haven't found a replacement for that. Yes, sounds like you have friends you just don't have any friends that are that kind of friends currently."
12149.0,Patient,"that's very. True, when i've been going through romantic breakups like I have had people say that, like since i'm such a one on one kind of person. I have had people say that, like. When you're single you're just going to be wanting that and it's it's fine to be that way but you're gonna feel like the grief of the relationship until you have someone new. So. I, and I do feel that romantically and, but I think you're right I I i've been scared to connect with people like not so much anymore, but like it didn't help my confidence that in. I had another episode. and heard a bunch of people like they all stuck with me. Because they're cool people and there were older i'm."
480.0,Provider,hurt a bunch of people I assume you mean verbally.
12149.0,Patient,yeah.
480.0,Provider,And like what kind what. What would you say that hurt that.
12149.0,Patient,i'm. I would just be kind of nuts kind of critical calling people out like i'm pretty insightful so like. Like I can cut kind of deep with my words um.
480.0,Provider,"So typically when you're not manic you have a good filter meaning like. Oh yeah someone's going to receive whatever you're going to say, well, so the difference is when you're manic you just kind of."
12149.0,Patient,"say what you do. yeah no filter and all my emotions are on high. um and like I I think it's because my parents, but I have this really intense urge for people to back me up like. I feel like one person wronged me and I want. Another person to call them out, especially men. You know, like like I want my new boyfriend to tell my ex boyfriend like it was an Okay, what happened. kind of thing um and and people don't love that. And my friends yeah."
480.0,Provider,Early not.
12149.0,Patient,rested and doing. So there's like this yeah.
480.0,Provider,I wonder why.
12149.0,Patient,"Because of my parents, like my dad, no matter how insane my mom would get and how persecutors prosecutorial towards me he would always back her up. He had this like blind loyalty to her. until he didn't and then he just never wanted to talk to her again like it was really tough for him to co parent with her. And, but yeah he never stood up to me, to the point that he got physically abusive you know, like. It it was yeah it was bad."
480.0,Provider,"And he never know what you want. kind of blind loyalty, but only when you're manic. yeah yeah. yeah so interesting it's like. You mimic all of moms stuff."
12149.0,Patient,Oh God yeah and that's what sucks is because it kind of turned into her. When two is unhealthy they go to a so they get really big. And I don't love that. Like to be tactful. i'm like. insightful in ways that people ask for.
480.0,Provider,unsolicited advice and opinions.
12149.0,Patient,"Like I do try to fix people to i'm like Well, this is your core issues, so you should be doing this, let me help you in like you know."
480.0,Provider,Trying to currently work with my 11 year old on that concept like not every opinion or thought has to be voiced.
12149.0,Patient,Because he just.
480.0,Provider,filter and hurting people because they're getting to the age where like you know they're not little kids anymore so they're actually taking to heart what he says and. Re it's so hard it's so hard to train someone who doesn't have a filter to have a filter.
12149.0,Patient,"I was like that, for a long time, and like I would want to tell people secrets to other people to feel close to them and. I was in a row well received."
480.0,Provider,"Oh gosh no I went through that phase two, though, like middle school high school. yeah how you gain friends it's like telling other people's dirt."
12149.0,Patient,"Totally. yeah and nearly the bad kind of friends, though. Oh man yeah. yeah so. there's all that. But we did plan on talking about central today my romantic my friend who I care a lot about."
480.0,Provider,You want to tell them. how you feel but haven't yet. yeah okay.
12149.0,Patient,i'm scared to like.
480.0,Provider,"Okay, so here's here's what we need to do is, we need to go through all the pros and cons of both right, so the cost of not saying anything and keeping things exactly how they are."
12149.0,Patient,mm hmm.
480.0,Provider,"What would you come up with, as far as pros for that what would be the benefits of keeping things exactly how they are."
12149.0,Patient,"um it's been really sustainable for over a year. Okay hey i'm. We can talk about anything it's not in the same way that it was with my best friend where we're girls and we're like blabbing so much, but I could come to him about anything. yeah i'm. yeah we spend a lot of our time together um."
480.0,Provider,How often do you see him like daily.
12149.0,Patient,"every couple days Oh, I mean. during the week, we often have dinner. And then on the weekend. We usually spend both nights together, but like sometimes we'll have like a break in between like on Saturday morning ish afternoon I might go home and do some stuff and then."
480.0,Provider,"Oh, when you see those nights you mean like sleep overs."
12149.0,Patient,mm hmm. Oh yeah.
480.0,Provider,No wonder you're struggling.
12149.0,Patient,When we get into bed like we cuddle so close and we cuddle all night.
480.0,Provider,"i'm like. Man so i'm feeling the pain of the situation. Oh, my gosh."
12149.0,Patient,"And he has wondered if he's a sexual. um he he was very he still he was very nerdy like brilliant. You know not valedictorian but maybe fourth or fifth in high school and now he's a microbiologist. And he has like a cool job and a lot more money than me. And he has a really sweet family they're Indian and his parents moved here, not long before he was born. Like very. Very Indian yeah um and I know that he gets pressure from them he's 37 now and his little brother who's my age like 33 not only became like a full blown cardiologist this year but also like got married a few years back, and his wife is pregnant, you know so."
480.0,Provider,So that's what the parents want for him face.
12149.0,Patient,"very much. yeah and during quarantine they were like you got to find someone and. He was like you know coronavirus I feel like in his introvert way he was like he liked it he thrived it was like I don't have to see people, I have a great. excuse this is fun. He got back into doing starcraft and you know focused on his career and like. games and whatnot. So yeah there were like but there's people in the same situation as you, you know, like if you're online dating like i'm sure there's other people who would love to like get with your whatever and he was he's just like i'm good."
480.0,Provider,leave me alone.
12149.0,Patient,"yeah and I feel like it's starting to get to that point in bachelorhood where. they're like legitimately worried, you know and they like weekly check ins like they like strongly preferred to have a conversation with him every week which i'm sure he could go a lot longer if they didn't want that. But he does it. Like he's he's a he's a good person like. he'd prefer not to meet anyone's needs, but she will like if that's what they want."
480.0,Provider,"Okay, so that gives me a little more context as far as relationship wise, so if he prefers to not meet other people's needs, but he would, if they want, then, if you guys were in a romantic relationship how. Like How would you feel about that, knowing that he's only meeting your needs because he knows it's what he's supposed to do, not because he wants to."
12149.0,Patient,I thought about that and i've thought about our incompatibilities he's some sort of five six combo i'm pretty sure on the any Graham. Okay um and twos and fives like i've been with so many fives and they're like i've read.
480.0,Provider,me what's the five like what's the cloudiness.
12149.0,Patient,"they're like the investigator, like the like they're alone on an island, like they're really scared of being incompetent or unprepared and, like the person that you're like let's go kayaking and they've never been so they like research everything about it. get all the equipment. You know, like they're an expert before they've got on. Because like and they're. yeah very withdrawn often very smart and like know so much about so many random topics that they're really fun for me to pick their brain. But they're also very introverted and i've read that fives and twos are the most dissimilar numbers on the whole instagram."
480.0,Provider,pinterest interesting.
12149.0,Patient,Because like tues really want to connect and they want to get really deep and fives can feel overwhelmed.
480.0,Provider,With it connection.
12149.0,Patient,yeah and I think that they they really want it and they really love it but um.
480.0,Provider,"Well, I wonder if from. His perspective connection comes with responsibility right it's not just connection so that might be part of the problem for him is like maybe he does desire that connection, but he knows what responsibility comes with having that kind of connection."
12149.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
480.0,Provider,And that will get overwhelming.
12149.0,Patient,"mm hmm so then there's another layer to his relationship to sexuality, where. He. didn't have a sexual relationship with anyone until he was 25. Like he was a virgin until he was 25 like I don't even kissed a girl. oh dear and he'd been interested in women. um he's."
480.0,Provider,he's definitely strangest in happen. No he's straight. Like yeah notice for sure.
12149.0,Patient,"When I asked him like he seemed very open, he was like i've just never felt that way towards any men ever like I don't think you would feel really torn up if he did you know, like he."
480.0,Provider,"Oh, you can tell from someone's response if they're homophobic or not for sure."
12149.0,Patient,"Exactly yeah. um and he never felt threatened with me being, by the way, some people can wear like it's not like you're just hanging out with the girls like that could also mean that you might cheat or whatever i'm."
480.0,Provider,Finding a lot of guys.
12149.0,Patient,"yeah and like. Like I remember. When I moved one time, like within the bay area. I was sad because I really liked one of my roommates and he was like you should definitely hang out with him, like you, should you know, like he's very supportive of my friendships with men as well. um he he just seems really secure but it's almost in a way, where i'm like I want you to care more."
480.0,Provider,"I, are you jealous. yeah I know."
12149.0,Patient,What a little bit of bad.
480.0,Provider,it's so funny I still relate to that. This much jealous not like big just a little jealous.
12149.0,Patient,"yeah I want to know you care. So he also has a porn addiction, he told me. And that made it so that he couldn't get hard with other people mm hmm."
480.0,Provider,that's common.
12149.0,Patient,and
480.0,Provider,play you know what kind of porn.
12149.0,Patient,Get asked him. Because I was so curious as.
480.0,Provider,"Well, just because you said he might be a sexual i'm like is he one of those people that's into more like anime porn or actual."
12149.0,Patient,"No real people. But yeah he just said, all kinds and I don't know if that's like there's three specific times and he doesn't want to say, or if he's just super open because I watch porn but mine's like very specific. yeah like."
480.0,Provider,Most people do have specific or like you said they have specific interest but there may be five of those specific things that they like right right.
12149.0,Patient,yeah.
480.0,Provider,"yeah so when someone says, all kinds of things, I mean honestly I don't like semi dating this guy it's very casual at the moment, but he told me last week is a porn addiction i'm like what time and he said, all kinds and I was like oh I don't know how to."
12149.0,Patient,Give me nothing yeah.
480.0,Provider,that's me no insight into who you are.
12149.0,Patient,yeah and i'm most curious because I am very open like I don't mind incorporating things like.
480.0,Provider,yeah exactly.
12149.0,Patient,i've dabbled in all kinds of things and.
480.0,Provider,"Well, I feel like it's good knowledge to have because a lot of people get so scared to talk about sex that it makes. It really uncomfortable because then you're guessing what each other, like so that's why i'm like anybody I did I always ask what kind of party they watch because i'm like that gives me valuable information."
12149.0,Patient,"yeah yeah. that's what gets you off yeah. um so yeah and he said that it does go away a little bit when he gets really used to someone and it's easier to get hard. And I did notice that, like when because we met because we're dating. So."
480.0,Provider,I remember that part. yeah and so he was never able to get hard when you were dating.
12149.0,Patient,"No, he would."
480.0,Provider,Oh okay good.
12149.0,Patient,"yeah but it like if we tried to switch positions, who would lose an erection and I read the very common with. porn induced ED. And like it would take them a while to get hard, but if I was like I want you to Fuck me, can you can you."
480.0,Provider,would often like yeah like touch himself in a certain way that.
12149.0,Patient,"I could. work it out, you know yeah. And i'd be able to get him hard and i'd be able to. He would come yeah. And it was a lot of fun um and we did have like a few like role play kind of kinks that were really hot. But when I."
480.0,Provider,came into them.
12149.0,Patient,"Like yeah. yeah um, but when I caught feelings. Were we were role playing a bit and then he. He like we're fucking and he was like I want to put a baby in you, I want to keep you forever and. Then I was. yeah when I was 2020 2726 I got pregnant with an ID I think I mentioned. i'm Am I. Born again adamant yeah. And then I went through a period where it was too painful to think about pregnancy and then I went through a period where like kind of sobering up from my. manic depressive episodes where I was like I don't know if i'd be a good mom you know, like coming from such an abusive household and having a lot of that ingrained so it was very. But it was out of shame, where I like really wanted a family, but also you don't."
480.0,Provider,feel worthy yeah yeah.
12149.0,Patient,"So then, when he said that it just exploded it for me, where I was like I want a fucking baby. Like that sounds so great like and then that scared him. It did. Because, then I got manic not long after that. Like I was like i've really intense feelings for you, if you don't feel the same way I don't know if we should keep sleeping together because, like he gave me the most intense orgasm i've ever had like the kind you read about where you're like that's fake like. and To this day."
480.0,Provider,But it's. Not fake possible.
12149.0,Patient,"yeah it was so intense like like a spiritual experience it's so intense and after that I was like. I, like you, so. A lot you know."
480.0,Provider,hard to not get attached after something like that.
12149.0,Patient,So he was very respectful and he was like I totally understand whatever you need like I need you to like me as much.
480.0,Provider,time he needs you to catch up to my feelings right now.
12149.0,Patient,Hopefully it's a man keep me forever.
480.0,Provider,That baby in me now.
12149.0,Patient,"Yes, yeah. And then I remember when I was manic like I get about hypersexual and I like I remember like. He was sitting on the couch and I like got on top of him, and it was like kind of like touching his chest, or whatever, and he just like put his hands up and I was sort of like come on like kiss me like I was trying to get like a reaction out of him and he was like you know, like I. Like. i'm trying to hold this boundary for us. i'm trying to hold this boundary for you um. You know, like you really didn't want to blur the lines, and that was something that i've never had before, like i've definitely had breakups where like, then you sleep together again it's blurry maybe you try again and I was just sort of like. Am I unattractive you know, like i've never had this healthy of a breakup like you're. There for me."
480.0,Provider,"So it's funny that you said that was your reaction is like, do you not like me, because for me i'm like wow he actually cares so much about you, if he's willing to hold that boundary."
12149.0,Patient,"In retrospect, I understand that, but i've never really had something like so healthy and lovely before. With someone who didn't have just a shit ton of trauma or things that they hadn't examine to like he's never been to therapy, but I feel like he's examine himself and kind of gets it."
480.0,Provider,"gets his famous fairly self aware, at least. The conversations you've had like you know that he's capable. Live awareness and insight, which is important."
12149.0,Patient,Absolutely um and also him holding that boundary made him made me like him more.
480.0,Provider,Oh yeah.
12149.0,Patient,yeah like. You prioritize my health and well being. You know shit.
480.0,Provider,So confusing.
12149.0,Patient,"yeah so we we never took a break from sleep overs and cuddling and then, when coronavirus started, we did take a break, and he wasn't really seeing anyone and then like for a couple weeks and I was dying like I missed him so my. Her and um and then he was like maybe we can meet up and go for a walk with masks on. And we did that, and it was like really great my car had been stolen, so he was like driving to see me. And then he was like you know this is gonna be a while like Fuck it let's just hang out watch a movie. yeah yeah so I didn't have a car, at that point, so he would come pick me up, we would often make dinner together we'd watch a movie and then like around 11 or midnight, he would drive me back home, and he just like really went out of his way to be there for me no."
480.0,Provider,"wonder, you have feelings for him i'm having feelings for him and i'm. Like wow this is perfect."
12149.0,Patient,"And then I got a car and i'm, so I would do the I would drive to him, because he lives alone and his. Well, I was living in oakland at the time, so it was like 15 minutes. i'm. So, then, we had a period of me driving and us being able to hang out a little longer, because it was like whenever I if I was too tired to sleep, you know, or if I was too tired I just feel like i'm heading home. um so and he did tell me during that like Okay, then one night I had an allergic reaction, I took benadryl. And that night I was like. shit i'm feeling really sleepy all the sudden and he was like oh yeah the benadryl is probably kicking in i'm. Like why don't you stay here tonight I don't want you to drive if you're like hi on this and histamine. and i'm in the past, at all of our sleep overs I didn't necessarily bring pj is I just like sleep in my underwear and T shirt i'm. Even after we'd like stop sleeping together and he was like let me get you some pj pants and I was like a."
480.0,Provider,dagger right there and then he was like.
12149.0,Patient,"Maybe I should set you up on the couch. And I was like. And he was like you know what it's fine you can sleep in the bed with me I just really want to have better boundaries with you. And I tried to get a little bit more out of him, like like do not want to like for coronavirus, do you not want to be in the same room all night he's like no we're already. In each other's. Space like it's not bad um but then he was like whatever Fuck it, you can sleep in the same bed as me, but he put a pillow between us. damn thing."
480.0,Provider,sounds like it could be made into the best Rom COM right. Like the whole story i'm just like oh my gosh and what next one.
12149.0,Patient,"yeah wouldn't we hadn't been dating for too long, like i'm I was paulie so oh day other people when we hadn't been dating for too long, I made a new. dating profile, but like it was one where you can hide some pictures and then reveal them if you want to so. You couldn't really tell who I was from the picture that you could see and he reached out to me, and he was like hey I think you're really cool. um, and this was what like only a few months into a stating and on the profile because i'd been having these experiences with him, I was like i'm looking for something serious like i'd like to get married at some point have kids so he reached out to me and I was like."
480.0,Provider,And I know it was you ever or no.
12149.0,Patient,"He didn't know it was me in the beginning. And I friend was with me and she was like this is a hilarious Rom COM moment like. yeah. You just be. Direct with him, so I messaged him and I was like I saw that you messaged me like i'm really like cuz he's monogamous so I was, I thought it meant like the end of us being together and. he's still. searching and I was like are you Is there something else that you're wanting, are you, you know, like trying to get with someone else like more seriously and it's not me. And he was just really apologetic and he's like honestly that's the only message i've sent out. it's just that you don't see people like wanting to get serious, very often. So that's why he."
480.0,Provider,thinks he wants is something serious.
12149.0,Patient,"yeah yeah when we got together, he was like okay if you're poly that's fine do your thing, but what I want is to get married and have kids um. So that was always something that I thought that he was really interested in and anyways fast forward we I don't know how much longer we were having hangouts without sleep overs like after the benadryl incident. And um and then it just switch for him, he was like you should stay the night, and I think that he'd had time to heal from my manic episode, you know it was probably like march until maybe August. That we weren't really doing sleep overs that."
480.0,Provider,that's when you're trying to push the boundary and he had to say no right yeah that makes a lot of sense.
12149.0,Patient,"So he probably should put the boundary. Maybe in November before quarantine when I was pretty manic. So, but then I got depressed and like very. yeah and then the summer in the beginning of quarantine he he made the boundary and then. But then we started having sleep overs like pretty regularly, so I was kind of like okay like his boundaries are shifting I don't really understand what's going on. Because he's not telling me but. um and we weren't cuddling so just like lay there like feeling."
480.0,Provider,ever so awkward.
12149.0,Patient,yeah and then we started pedaling in the morning and then. At some point we just started pedaling at night to and.
480.0,Provider,Like everything just kind of like.
12149.0,Patient,yeah.
480.0,Provider,That takes so much. Sure stray I gosh.
12149.0,Patient,"yep yep. And then, like in this spring 2021 he was like I want to take you to palm springs and. It felt weird to like go on a vacation together spend multiple nights together just have one bed, like, I was in heaven. It was so fun for me and. He at one night we're both like more awake and not like falling asleep right away. And the way that he was cuddling me was more sexual like he was getting on top of me I was getting on top of him, like, I was so turned on. But like not trying to do much, and then I kissed him on the cheek because I just sort of one to like shoot my shot a little bit in a way that wasn't like totally crossing a boundary. And he sort of reacted and like a good way, but he didn't like try kissing me and I was like."
480.0,Provider,"he's so good, with those boundaries oh my God."
12149.0,Patient,Good good good.
480.0,Provider,Thank you.
12149.0,Patient,"And I think that sex is kind of vulnerable for him, because he might not get hard and sort of. Like feel shit or whatever um. But that's where we're at now and we're we're going another another trip we're going to death valley on the 22nd. And we're sharing a bed sharing a time. With all his friends."
480.0,Provider,"So my big question is we don't have a ton of time, but. What okay so. I don't even know I don't even know because i'm like so putting myself in your situation right now i'm like it would be impossible, not to say something eventually right like eventually you're gonna have to tell them how you feel."
12149.0,Patient,yeah like how have we not talked about this.
480.0,Provider,How do we not talked about this.
12149.0,Patient,"At one point kind of recently I sort of disclosed a lot like he we're talking about dreams and I was talking about how I have dreams about babies. And like sometimes giving birth, sometimes I just have the baby and oftentimes you don't have enough milk and I feel kind of inadequate and i'm like sure you guys get this baby. Because i'm very like prob breastfeeding, and he was like Oh, and then I was like should I tell him, should I tell him and I was like and then I just blurted it out, I was like it's often yours."
480.0,Provider,"yeah here, the father."
12149.0,Patient,"And then he was like oh that's sweet, but then we didn't say anything else, and at one point I was like Do you still think about having kids and whenever I bring shit up he's pretty good at not talking about it, he was like well I like the idea. um. And then he sort of changed the subject it's like. God. damn it drives me crazy. yeah so I know we were trying to do a pros and cons list."
480.0,Provider,"Well, may be something to do on your own."
12149.0,Patient,This yeah.
480.0,Provider,"pros and cons list, and then we can talk about it next week and kind of go through them."
12149.0,Patient,yeah.
480.0,Provider,"I don't think it's realistic to expect that you're never going to tell them how you feel right. The problem is, you don't want to lose this situation which I get like I I don't want you to lose the situation, it sounds perfect. So you know lovely push him away but also you're like emotional self harming basically by continuing to do this."
12149.0,Patient,"And then putting things on pause like i've slept with some of my friends, my friends are very sex positive so it's almost hard not to. And I had this like this one friend that I sleep with sometimes was like. Oh, this girl wants to have a threesome with us and she's so cute I hadn't really thought about her that much, but like she's so cute like I was very attracted to her, and I was like that sounds so fun. And then we really connected her and I, and then we like went to this camping trip and she and I hung out like the whole time like it was just very fun to be around each other. And then we went on a date just us and it's like it kind of blossomed and we've been sleeping together and hanging out like every week and which for either of us we like don't let people into our weekly rotation very easily you know we like a lot of time alone and. we're just cautious and then like. Two times ago, maybe last weekend, she she was like I kind of want to be girlfriends with you like I i'd like to make it a little bit more official a little more public. And I was like yeah I also have this thing going with someone who like I sort of like to be monogamous with but i'm also like I don't want to put things on hold. So I kind of feel like i'm holding back a little bit with her in the sense that, like, I want to, and she said, like if you end up getting married or whatever like are monogamous or whatever, like, I fully support your decision, like, I want to stay friends like I really care about you um. But."
480.0,Provider,"yeah The thing is, while this situation is still going on you're never going to be able to. Fully jump in with anyone else. you're always gonna have like a piece of you that's holding back and so that's the part where like when I say emotional self harm that sounds very dramatic, but basically you're causing yourself to suffer by continuing to hold back your feelings and then also hold back and other relationships."
12149.0,Patient,yeah and i've even tried like. to cultivate feelings for other people. It just hasn't happened the same way. i'm. yeah.
480.0,Provider,"Oh hard like it's it's it's interesting because. To me it seems like such an ideal situation, but then also. I get that aching for more you know what I mean so it's like yeah on the outside that situation looks great I want to have a cuddle buddy that I sleep over with and like things are perfect and you know you genuinely genuinely care about each other but. It would be impossible not to constantly be aching for more. Hard spot to be in for sure."
12149.0,Patient,"yeah like when we watch movies, I want to cuddle with him on the couch but like I don't but then we like cuddle all night so it's like yeah like. it's very strange."
480.0,Provider,very confusing boundaries with that relationship for sure. yeah we're gonna pros and cons list and that might be helpful.
12149.0,Patient,yeah i'll do that because it's time.
480.0,Provider,"it's been what like a year and a half, two years that you've known him."
12149.0,Patient,Two and a half.
480.0,Provider,yeah okay wow.
12149.0,Patient,"So, like we work together. Not. professionally like I just mean like. We work."
480.0,Provider,"Together, like actually work together."
12149.0,Patient,"No, no, no, I just mean like it works inside like wait. that's a whole nother layer yeah just it works. Yes, I mean so."
480.0,Provider,Oh wow well. I don't know how to wrap this session up other than wow.
12149.0,Patient,yeah yeah we're like right in the.
480.0,Provider,middle of the Rom COM and I don't know what's coming next.
12149.0,Patient,"yeah yeah i'm glad I caught you up i'll do list. And you know we can maybe start with that next time because, like, I feel like i've covered a good amount of history of who I am and stuff so."
480.0,Provider,yeah perfect love it. Alright well have a good week i'll see you tomorrow right.
12149.0,Patient,Oh yeah yeah yeah thanks for your time.
480.0,Provider,Thank you.
12149.0,Patient,Okay bye.
