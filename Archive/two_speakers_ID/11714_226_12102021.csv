226.0,Provider,"yeah very good, so the last time that we spoke, I think you were doing an outpatient program yes, that sounds."
11714.0,Patient,"Like yeah yeah it's been a while I stopped going to that a while ago just mainly kind of because I like lost my transportation and I want to, I want to get back into it, but i've just kind of don't really have like means to get there at the moment, you know. But i'm working on it, because, like it seemed like I was doing a whole lot better when I was when I was going there you know, obviously."
226.0,Provider,"All right, any any relapses since I was there."
11714.0,Patient,"I mean pretty much I like. My hope pretty much the last week, since we last talked has been like a relapse really you know I mean, as far as not enough like like opiates or anything um but. I like because I couldn't make my appointments so like, then I kept getting like a smaller and smaller amounts of boxing you know. And it kept running out and it's just like that kind of is like kept like throwing everything, like all kind of like like like blacked out but it's. You know, we just the fact that, like I made this appointment and I think if I make one more, I think, to bump it up to where it can get like a decent supply so that will be like helped me a lot longer yeah."
226.0,Provider,yeah yeah yeah so it's really i'm only screw myself when I when I don't go to my stuff i'm supposed to.
11714.0,Patient,"Do it but. You know i'm working on it, you know, and I would like, as far as outpatient thing goes about with you guys um I plan on going back there soon."
226.0,Provider,"Okay, so wedding relaxing on."
11714.0,Patient,"Like me, is."
226.0,Provider,Like math.
11714.0,Patient,yeah sometimes roles you.
226.0,Provider,"Okay, so um how much math are you saying."
11714.0,Patient,"i've said not really like an everyday thing, but like when I. Do it's I don't know it's really just probably like smoking like a bowl with some friends, so I really don't really know what the amount would be that but I mean. I don't know, maybe like a like a couple points or something like that."
226.0,Provider,"Okay, how much adderall you taken."
11714.0,Patient,"It just like a one one pill I guess. yeah but i'd say like in like a week i'm probably only probably have been, I think, for the most part, I haven't been using like every day it's maybe been like half the days you know, so I mean probably like three or four days a week, I guess at the most. But, but now I mean it's been like i've been on a cake for like. Six days with nothing and i'm finally starting to kind of feel a little bit better. But i've just been I just feel so like any effective, you know what I mean like. Like I can't get anything done like. Without it, you know it sucks."
226.0,Provider,yeah. Just the suboxone help with the Matthews at all.
11714.0,Patient,"I didn't show yeah I think with cravings I think it does, because I mean it wasn't that long ago, where I wasn't doing anything and I felt Okay, you know so they just kind of need to like remember that and yeah I think really like, if I can just get. Make probably my next couple appointments or whatever I need to do and get you know I like I remember at the most, I think I was getting like two weeks of suboxone at a time and. That really seemed like help with everything just having a good supply of it, you know, and I actually got down to take one one a day, but I kind of bumped it up to. it's kind of like like either one or two a day, right now, because it was just on one I noticed, I was like having like a lot of back pain and so. And I feel like also like I kind of like need something more with with just one some days, but I feel like some days, if I take two I don't really have a lot of cravings for anything else so."
226.0,Provider,"Okay, so right, so it just sounds like you need to just get back on track here so for the cravings. That we want to make sure that you're getting enough where you don't run out now we want to make sure that you're making all of your appointments, because if you're on the medication then you're going to feel like you have more of a life okay you're in feel more accomplished. And if you're not feeling accomplished, then you know the relapse can kind of creep creeps back in."
11714.0,Patient,"yeah yeah so I told you, I totally agree with that let's like that's what they want."
226.0,Provider,"Okay, so let's think of okay so let's work on we're going to do some like treatment plan goals here, so what are what are too short term goals that you want to focus on right now that will. That will be recovered that will support your recovery."
11714.0,Patient,"Well, I would like to. Just i'd say be like like hyper like vigilant on on doing the things that I need to do as far as like appointments stuff."
226.0,Provider,"yeah Okay, so you want to make sure that you're attending. Your group for sure your group on Wednesday. And then you want to make sure that you're you're meeting with me two times a month okay. Okay. So low you know those those are great you know those are really great short term goals, because we want those goals to be attainable. and Are you having to do makeup groups, the groups that you missed on Wednesday is that what they told you, you need to do."
11714.0,Patient,"No, not yet never anything about that."
226.0,Provider,What about your surveys and your truck screener those up to date.
11714.0,Patient,um I just did a joke stream like two days ago. And my dude all three surveys. On my group name.
226.0,Provider,"Okay okay perfect so you want to make sure your. Surveys are always up to date that you're doing the ones you need to do, once a week. And then obviously the joke screen is once a month."
11714.0,Patient,He go.
226.0,Provider,"So all of this stuff that we're talking about it's going to keep you in the green. And then green, then you can get your suboxone you don't have to do the four days and then go to the pharmacy right, so this will put you out like maybe once a week or two weeks, so you happy. Right okay."
11714.0,Patient,yeah.
226.0,Provider,"Okay, so let's talk about. Okay, to long term goals can think of to long term goals and you want to work on."
11714.0,Patient,"i'd like. To get going back to my Dell patient place, I was known to."
226.0,Provider,"OK, so to get back to that iot gap transportation."
11714.0,Patient,"yeah really it's just getting my bike fix. Okay, but that's really all it is, I mean it's in town so i'm lucky that I live in a really small town, but it's within biking distance so that's that's pretty cool but i've just i've been trying to fix my bike for like two months and it's just really. it's just really it's ridiculous the whole situation so it's electric so it's kind of more complicated than normal bike but um. Hopefully, very soon as should be done. I mean i've been saying that for a month or two but. I really do think it should be done before Christmas, I hope."
226.0,Provider,So can we put get your bike fixed on the short term goal list would that be.
11714.0,Patient,yeah yeah yeah. yeah i'd like i'd like it to be.
226.0,Provider,So is it just a matter of our youth fixing it or somebody else.
11714.0,Patient,"No i'm fixing it is what it is, is I upgraded some stuff on it and. it's like some of its part of some of the parts are like from China and. it's just kind of just been a huge ass hassle so i'm just kind of way to get a little bit more money to just kind of buy it buy a new part for it, when I have that. i'll put it in, and I mean it should be rocking probably that day, no, no, also add a lot to my joy because, like, I feel very trapping stuck at my house right now and that's like a feeling I hate, more than anything. it's really. really like. It really bothers me, you know that feeling I mean like I feel like that, for a lot about other stuff but like I literally physically feel like I can't go anywhere, you know."
226.0,Provider,"Are you okay sweet you're shopping with mom right. yeah Okay, and are you do you getting kind of assets irs SDI or anything like that."
11714.0,Patient,"Just just snapping and it's expired, I need to call today and get it get restarted again but um yeah just like food stamps. I really would like to like I mean hopefully I just got a laptop today, so I can work on my resume so i'd like to get a job you know I really didn't want to get back down to. Where it was like destitute and had no money, but my own employment ran out and I supposed to be getting according to my dad I supposed to be getting like. I mean there's my grandparents state like i'm part of the trust and like I supposed to be getting like i'm guessing i'm guessing like 150,000 bucks. And that was it was supposed to be around October and a time when unemployment last like I knew i'd be like really stretch. And you know and barely make it, but like October was in my head because that's what my dad said, and now it turns out it's not going to be till March, you know next year. I guess is the earliest I might get it, it sounds like i'm still gonna get it, but I mean I don't really know the deal, but I just got a bunch of stuff from like our attorney about it and um. But anyway, I mean it's kind of dumb for me to rely on anything he says, but. I mean that's kind of what I base everything on you know because I really went unemployment with the pandemic, I really got used to it's crazy. How like I had gotten so used to like having no money you know and just and just operating like that, and now you know the buy things I need to buy and you know just kind of you know, not necessarily crap but just you know, be able to do stuff if I if I wanted to you know. And now i'm pretty much on like. Like destitute status and just it's it's super depressing, you know, so I would like to anyway, like my point with that is that I mean i'm willing to. I mean, if I can find some kind of Okay, you have to be that great of a job which is somehow a little job around town that I get to because I don't have a car, right now, I would be more than happy to work, you know so it's not like i'm disabled or anything you know."
226.0,Provider,yeah right So what are some. What let's talk about places that you can apply to.
11714.0,Patient,"as well, I mean I live in a pretty small little town there's not really a lot that I see for a while I was seeing like a job at like. some kind of like calling ourselves liquidators and they do like auctions of like stuff look like the Hello. Will. Like it doesn't like return some stores, where they will play some golf on TV that sounds like a pretty cool job, but I just don't have a resume or. trying to figure out how I could get a computer to work on my end because I have an iPad but I don't know really how to like word process with that in own. But I mean other than that I just gonna have to kind of keep my eye on because i'm pretty limited, I mean sacramento's not that far away, but I mean on the car right now so it's kind of."
226.0,Provider,"So are there other places, that you can apply where you don't need to have a resume like I think restaurants can apply, I honestly don't want to work in a restaurant yeah."
11714.0,Patient,"i'm just you know you know and like I know i'm not saying i'm better than that everything, but I feel like i've had enough shitty job like that that you know I really also from working on ships my feet hurt really, really bad like so scanning for like extended amount of time. Right really almost makes like excruciating pain so it's just like. yeah you know, I guess, I guess, if I was a super hard off, and I was that crucial, I guess, I could, but I really don't want to wait. I feel like that would probably depressed me more than not working yeah."
226.0,Provider,"Okay, so is there, somebody that you know that can help you put this resume together a computer that if I even if you go to the library sometimes."
11714.0,Patient,"I just I just. traded a scooter is this guy today like an hour ago for like a laptop. One of those those ones that like you know you can open it up and it's like a. touchscreen you know, like a full is open the other way and stuff it runs windows, so I just got that that a little bit ago so yep I can I can do it myself, no."
226.0,Provider,"Okay, great so make that a goal like this and get that done this weekend."
11714.0,Patient,yeah yeah definitely.
226.0,Provider,"Okay, so you've got some things that you can do that can keep you busy."
11714.0,Patient,"yeah yeah yeah no i'm glad i'm really kind of you know, I felt like it was like I was like has a bunch of excuses, but it's like I really you know, like. I feel like if I know I don't have a lot of like recent work experience, but I feel like in any kind of like that job I was kind of shooting, for I don't know if it's still on indeed but that that liquidators place, I could probably go more and. You know, a pretty good worker, you know, really, I mean. For the most part, as long as i'm not all fucked up you know. I take them at the age now where I think I would take a job pretty seriously i'd be really happy to have some do."
226.0,Provider,You know right absolutely.
11714.0,Patient,"yeah you got Okay, so you got some short term and long term goals, so."
226.0,Provider,"You know, for term that's attending group. Your next session with me is December 31 one."
11714.0,Patient,"Okay, I like how it's like if it's going to be just like two weeks. from each other that kind of it's easy to mark on my calendar and so so i'll try and that's easy to remember it's the 30th 31st to so. Right okay."
226.0,Provider,"Okay, and then you know. Then I would work on your resume this weekend."
11714.0,Patient,Okay yeah I will definitely.
226.0,Provider,"Okay, so you got some things that you can do, and we will talk in a couple weeks and see where you are."
11714.0,Patient,"cool Thank you so much, I appreciate your time."
226.0,Provider,"Okay, good seeing you."
11714.0,Patient,"There, excuse me, too."
