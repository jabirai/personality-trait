10561.0,Patient,I wear many hats.
705.0,Provider,"You you do you wear many hats. give you some variety. Absolutely. I wanted to see to James i'm meeting with people and, as I meet with people i'm asking them like right now I know you come to weekly groups which is great when you feel like you're more stable and you need less groups like maybe a couple of times a month. Then let me know."
10561.0,Patient,All right.
705.0,Provider,"Would you say right now, you feel like coming to group every week has been official or do you feel like a reduction should occur. Reduction okay."
10561.0,Patient,Because i'm pretty stable right now.
705.0,Provider,"yeah I would agree with that James absolutely you're very stable it feels like you've made a lot of progress. Okay, then what you what we can do, then let me open up your chart and I will put them. it's twice a month, like you, and I will continue to meet twice a month and then twice a month for group does that sound like the better plan."
10561.0,Patient,yeah that sounds fine to me.
705.0,Provider,"As you feel to you know if there's a time where you feel like okay now i'm even making more progress, and I want to reduce it then just talk to me, and we can look at it and go from there."
10561.0,Patient,"Alright, well, I can't go last two or put me at the yellow according to shanteau."
705.0,Provider,"If. If James you and I changed it to less group times, then you would still need that care intensity we're talking about so I have people that. have made progress and then they're working along you know they're working and then they're trying to do, different things, and so, sometimes they can go down to once a month. Well cool yeah do you feel like you're at a level right now to do, once a month or you want to start with let's try twice a month and then see how you do on that."
10561.0,Patient,test to twice a month and move on from there.
705.0,Provider,"I like that plan yeah see how you do. If ever two gyms you feel like you need more support, you can always call the virtual Center and they can get you in like even though you and I are scheduled to only meet twice a month, if you have something going on, and you need to talk to me, you can call and request a meeting."
10561.0,Patient,alright.
705.0,Provider,"So i'm going to then come in to what's called your care intensity and we're going to lower it. To twice a month. So twice a month two groups. Twice a month. You and I meet. And then let's save and close this and then i'll see to James as far as. Which appointments let's see So when I look at group, for then October. You were able to attend on the eighth. And then, after you attend on the 15th which is this Friday. Then you would be able to have you're already two times a month. All right, yeah. And then that way, if you don't want to come back into group until November, just on your calendar circle, maybe two days that you're going to come in, like which Fridays."
10561.0,Patient,All right.
705.0,Provider,"As long as you're able James to keep track of each month coming at least two times, then now i'll put you in good standing with that care intensity."
10561.0,Patient,Okay.
705.0,Provider,"So do you have with you today, I see a tell."
10561.0,Patient,A cat his name is ash.
705.0,Provider,Oh that's Q. As ash wanting some attention.

705.0,Provider,"Oh, I see. that's funny you and I to James are scheduled for October the. 27th."

10561.0,Patient,"Well, sometimes i'm not. Great."
705.0,Provider,"Maybe not the state champion, but still you go out and have fun."
10561.0,Patient,that's all it matters.

10561.0,Patient,Do you have any thanksgiving plans. not yet no.

10561.0,Patient,"Yes, definitely."
705.0,Provider,Your family you're still seeing you know spending time with family.
10561.0,Patient,Oh yeah a couple times a week I spent time with everyone. That lives around here.
705.0,Provider,"Well, good. I think that that sounds good, and you know i'm sure the closer you get to thanksgiving you'll set up a plan of where you eat dinner and. You usually have a big lunch or big dinner for thanksgiving. Okay. and Do you like the pies like a pumpkin pie or pecan."
10561.0,Patient,"Well, usually a pumpkin pie. Some types both but usually pumpkin."
705.0,Provider,"Which one, are you the bigger fan of."
10561.0,Patient,The pumpkin.
705.0,Provider,I saw that some of the grocery stores are already having the pumpkin pies and the pumpkin spice latte. Good stuff.
10561.0,Patient,"I have a question. So, as far as the group's go do I just pick any two weeks I want or data checking out the virtual neck about it, how does it work."
705.0,Provider,"Good question James, it is up to you, so as long as you keep track like right now in October, you do, you have your calendar right."
10561.0,Patient,yeah right in front of me.
705.0,Provider,"You could develop a system like maybe circle, like the eighth you went to group. So, once you have the eight, then you would only need one more Friday group to attend."
10561.0,Patient,Okay.
705.0,Provider,So it doesn't matter which one you pick and you do not need to call the virtual Center you would just pick which one you want to go to and then attended and you know how you check in that day.
10561.0,Patient,Yes.
705.0,Provider,"So, on that day, that you, you go you decide to go go ahead, then, and you check in but, before you don't have to schedule your your."
10561.0,Patient,group attendance okay.
705.0,Provider,"This frees you up, because then maybe this Friday you don't want to go and you decide that maybe the next Friday, you want to go. Well, that help you."
10561.0,Patient,"Go this Friday. yeah i'll help me out because I work a full time job and I, like all the free time I get."
705.0,Provider,"yeah that makes total sense. When you're trying to juggle you know life with working and then also to trying to. Get out and go Bowling and other fun things. Well, good and anytime James if you have a question just ask away that's what this is all about, this is a safe space."
10561.0,Patient,Alright sounds good right.
705.0,Provider,Did you have dreams any other questions.
10561.0,Patient,"No, I do."
705.0,Provider,"Okay, do you think by circling on your calendar like twice a month is that going to work for you to keep track of going to. Two meetings."
10561.0,Patient,Oh yeah i'll keep track it down.
705.0,Provider,"Okay, all right, and if anytime again if you want to make some changes just let me know and we'll go from there."
10561.0,Patient,Okay sounds good.
705.0,Provider,"Well, great James well, I hope you have fun Bowling. Maybe i'll pull a couple of strikes."
10561.0,Patient,I always get a couple.
705.0,Provider,"Now, and you are way better than you're letting on. you're being humble."
10561.0,Patient,I still have a good score.
705.0,Provider,hey you can do a strike you have me beat by lungs long shot. I tend to hit the gutter balls.
10561.0,Patient,I used to be like that.
705.0,Provider,Oh. What changed then.
10561.0,Patient,I just got better.
705.0,Provider,It sounds like that definitely by you practice in that you got better and now you're throwing strikes.

10561.0,Patient,All right.
705.0,Provider,"Okay, and if for any reason, you need to cancel that one and reschedule, then you could just call the virtual Center and they could make that happen."
10561.0,Patient,All right.
705.0,Provider,"Okay, James will take care and i'll see you soon and."
10561.0,Patient,"have one more question. Absolutely, if I feel like I need to attended our group session I just show up, yes, have to be to."
705.0,Provider,know you can just show up James.
10561.0,Patient,All right.
705.0,Provider,"yeah if you feel like you need more support than the to then go ahead and show up and then you and I will communicate that maybe we need to readjust it, you know, maybe three times a. month is what you want to come to but yeah you don't need to first ask me to come into the group, you and I can sort it out."
10561.0,Patient,All right.
705.0,Provider,Does that sound okay.
10561.0,Patient,sounds good to me.
705.0,Provider,"Okay, then James will break and I will see you soon."
