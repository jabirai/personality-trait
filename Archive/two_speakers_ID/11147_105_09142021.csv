105.0,Provider,Michelle Salazar.
11147.0,Patient,"Good morning, good."
105.0,Provider,All right. um I have to open up a note for us real quick if there's anything you need to do like get a charger get a glass of water tissue this would be good timing for that.
11147.0,Patient,Oh. i'm ready.
105.0,Provider,"Okay, do you want to share I saw a little something of did I see a job interviews coming up."
11147.0,Patient,yeah actually started applying for two days ago I already got one job but. I have so much call Center experience and they're only paying 1250. uh huh and it's not a work at home being so. I got another interview at 11 and that's for $16 an hour so it's a lot more and it's a work at home.
105.0,Provider,Nice um so so so let's see what time is it where you are.
11147.0,Patient,it's a little bit after.
105.0,Provider,yeah you want to when when's the latest that you can and still make your interview.
11147.0,Patient,"Well they're gonna call me, so I say like maybe. Hopefully, like five or maybe 10 minutes."
105.0,Provider,What does that mean 510 minutes what's that mean.
11147.0,Patient,Like before the end of her.
105.0,Provider,or so at 1050.
11147.0,Patient,yeah okay that's okay.
105.0,Provider,"Of course yeah not a problem that's that's fine um, let me just take a peek here at. Okay yeah so i'm going to make a little note on you have a goal of I want to get back to work. So i'm just going to say. client has. The job interview today and you've been putting in applications right."
11147.0,Patient,yeah I got hired at one of them I. don't know if I want to accept that one yet. Because in a call Center setting it's you're very close to people. And with the whole covert they're going to probably send everybody to work at home anyway again.
105.0,Provider,"which might mean you have the job, and then they end up sending you home so might work out. Oh, maybe okay well sweet um okay so we'll just extended and then, if it turns out, you get the job we can close that at another time and are you. How much are you going outside I know you've been sort of forced to do it with this walking to school and things like that. Let me see what the objective was challenges and barriers to to well what's the current challenge for you in. Going on a vacation spending time outdoors."
11147.0,Patient,"i'm not too sure about that because, like I said I have this really bad anxiety try to talk to the doctor about it, I don't know if you're logged in first or you might have been like running a couple minutes late, but I always walk in early. So it's just my anxieties just bad and, like my chest hurts. i'm still trying to. Go on, and making myself try but. The reason I would like to work at home is just because of the whole covered don't want to catch that again and then my legs are still very weak they're getting stronger but there's so many."
105.0,Provider,Setting up a primary care physician checkup Where are you with that.
11147.0,Patient,"They can't get me and until December. I called them, but if i'm on the list for any cancellations."
105.0,Provider,"A specific moment where Well, first let me write down how many milligrams right how many milligrams you out of the buprenorphine right now."
11147.0,Patient,19 know what she told me to.
105.0,Provider,Is this for one week you've been on it for one week.
11147.0,Patient,I bet it Friday.
105.0,Provider,"Okay, last Friday. Okay. So let's take a second and more than a second. and Let me hear a moment. What you call anxiety, we just not a long story a very isolated, it was this and I felt this."
11147.0,Patient,"For example, when i'm taking a shower. My body starts different enough, I feel like I can't breathe. Okay i'm literally like fighting for air and I know how to control my brain I don't just. Like breathing in and out and try to take deep breaths and slower us. By time I get out of the shower i'm literally shaking and sweating like it's a kind of button is just take shower because i'm like fence and sweat I dragged myself off and i'm just sweating I have to get under the sea."
105.0,Provider,I get it shower when was the when did this start this sweating and shaking and the other symptom you said was chest I can't breathe.
11147.0,Patient,yeah really feels like right here by my heart.
105.0,Provider,When did that start.
11147.0,Patient,it's been going on for about two weeks.
105.0,Provider,"So now, I want you to. you've identified this word anxiety for some time. and Maybe find one older than that than two weeks ago. i'm assuming you had what you would describe as anxiety it's been here longer than two."
11147.0,Patient,"weeks yeah um The thing is, I would not go out anywhere I isolated myself."
105.0,Provider,To stay on the solution.
11147.0,Patient,mm hmm.
105.0,Provider,"what's the actual event that you believe causes anxiety, where you think or suspect anxiety is coming from."
11147.0,Patient,Like being in the store. And i'm just shopping or even waiting at the pharmacy for my my prescription are waiting in line at the checkout. that's when I start noticing like my palm start getting sweaty and a couple of times i've actually just left my grocery Sir i'm like I can't do this I had to leave.
105.0,Provider,That significant I again trying to find that's a great example when was the earliest time you remember having that experience.
11147.0,Patient,"And that was about two weeks ago. Actually, you know i'm gonna say three weeks ago. And now that my daughter's in school, I have to. go shopping a lot. i've noticed it's actually happen every time I go either to the pharmacy or standing in a line i'm. The mask I can't breathe wearing the mask inside the stores i'm fully vaccinated, but I still wear them."
105.0,Provider,"What do you mean you can't breathe you breathe, I know you did because you're alive right now tell me what you mean I can't read."
11147.0,Patient,"It feels like a Capri like if i'm. Literally suffer TV and then my heart rate like I didn't start. Excuse me, I know it's going fast because. I can hear just nothing but don't be."
105.0,Provider,"Right Okay, you can hear it. Okay. i'm wondering if you might benefit from some em Dr. You and I I don't believe have done em Dr it's a very specific technique it's like an eight phase technique, but I have been able to do it. In telemedicine normally I have these little buzzers that are in people's hands or I have these little headphones that go on, but I have been able to do it online. What if we started to set that up for the next two sessions."
11147.0,Patient,"I think we did that, before like you had me close my eyes and see what I could hear."
105.0,Provider,No absolutely not close the eyes. your eyes definitely be open in fact you would be watching my finger doing this.
11147.0,Patient,Okay.
105.0,Provider,"yeah no it's very, very specific lots of steps to it, but what you're describing it has had good good outcome for people for what you're describing it's kind of a complex process, but it might work so let's do this if you can. It is called I movement desensitization and reprocessing so. It does require you to get to to let's say objects that are tall that, let me show you there's some setup required because you're not here in front of me, so you can't. use. My stuff. So what I use is I can't you sound or the vibration. So I use I movement to get the bilateral stimulation see if you can find two objects to shampoo bottles to hair spray bottles, that are the same size. But when you put them, you need to have them I level, so you might need to stack them on a basket or something it does take some setup but at least will know what the setup is today, and then in the future. you'll be able to go right to it."
11147.0,Patient,"Okay, I have a cup and then have two different colors so."
105.0,Provider,"We got a color doesn't matter we just needed to be the same height, because your eyes the bilateral stimulation, has to do with the eyes, but again they can't be down here they're not down here notice I know you're looking down. you wait they gotta be up here. If you're I. Take your eyes, like this and stick your hand out, they need to be this level. So they might be sitting on top of a basket. Each one of them might be something else two books, the box. So that they are at your eye level."
11147.0,Patient,phone the other way to I don't know if it matters but. I just got a new phone so i'm still trying to figure everything out on it.
105.0,Provider,So this takes a little bit of time it's not it's not a hurry.
11147.0,Patient,"can't find anything else, let me. See i'm trying to stack things here. Just find something else. This might be. Okay yeah that works, a lot better. This way, because it's, the only way to my phone just stay. Okay, so I got this jar. that's high level with me."
105.0,Provider,"Okay, and then you want to have it about the width of your shoulder so just imagine that there are these two objects to. You may have only gotten one. it's Okay, the snake is long as it hold on Let me give you the instruction. You want to have that you're going to basically be looking at the top of these objects they're going to be about shoulder width apart and they're going to be the same height."
11147.0,Patient,actually got to have the same jars.
105.0,Provider,that's great.
11147.0,Patient,I use them for my dog snacks.
105.0,Provider,"And it could be that we only do the prep because, again, this is. An eight phase model of treatment, but we'll get as far as we can, today, and then we'll follow it up the next time we."
11147.0,Patient,"Have a question. I have seen a psychiatrist and i've been diagnosed with ptsd. uh huh on more than one occasion. i've seen say coaches, in the past and I don't know if maybe that's what's going on with anxiety and. yeah something maybe triggering that I don't know."
105.0,Provider,"it's it's very, very, very possible, and so this stuff that i'm about to do with you, is one of the evidence based treatments for post traumatic stress disorder. So it's a very good treatment protocol for it. yeah it's a good one for it so we'll be addressing what's interesting is we address those sort of. holder symptoms and it's connection to fret and fear about the future. It addresses the somatic response, the stuff you're talking about with the sweaty hands the heart palpitations so it's all it's all addressed."
11147.0,Patient,Okay.
105.0,Provider,"yeah i'm glad you brought that up it's very possible that those are getting activated on an unconscious level, you may not know what those those triggers are sometimes they get they get connected. You know, an event from the past yep. i'm glad you glad you told me that so let's see I want to do a little, this is a complicated process, so I want to do a little psycho education on it for a minute. there's different theories about what the mechanism of action is of why it works. So you're welcome to look it up it's em D are welcome to look it up. So there's no set one theory about why it works, we just know that it does. i've got a couple of opinions about two. ways that I think it does work. So I want to talk to you a little bit about what it will look like, for you. What it will look like, for you is that because i'm here through telemedicine. And a phone is only this wide it won't be you looking at my finger moving three or four inches because what's required is that the bilateral stimulation, which is going to be your eye movement moving left and right. As it addresses the two hemispheres of the brain. It it requires that your eyes move not so they hurt, but that they have enough bilateral stimulation to be effective, and so what i'll end up doing is. i'll end up testing it and i'll see whether it hurts your eyes. You don't want to be too close where it hurts your eyes, you don't want to be too far and what i've learned over the years, doing this with people in here and Bray her health, and then it says about as far as your wrist. As it is to your note to your face basically so you don't want it to be like this, because now you're having to turn it up, you want it back far enough, and you won't be moving your head you'll just be moving your eyes left and right like this and what i'll be doing is i'm going to be. setting the pace with my finger or pen and i'll be doing this. But you won't be watching the pin you'll get the rhythm of it through your peripheral vision and you'll just be looking at the top of those jars."
11147.0,Patient,Okay.
105.0,Provider,"So I all i'm going to do right now is i'm just going to see whether it hurts your eyes and work because we're all we're doing right now is the setup we're doing the mechanics of it and i'ma do some psycho education. on it, so what I want you to do is I want you to be right in the Center where the phone is i'm assuming it's right in the Center and these two objects are exactly the same distance left and right about shoulder width apart. Next to the phone okay and reach your arm out and see if it's about from where the risk to your faces or if you might be a little too far back. So you're probably a little too far back you may want to pull it in about three or four inches towards you but we'll see don't do it yet, because you might be. You might be at the perfect distance, so I don't know. So make sure you're right there in the middle of those two and I want you to only look at the top of the object not not through and check me out and, once you do that, once you to look top of the object top of the other one just back and forth, but don't move your face just your eyes."
11147.0,Patient,And he said it brought him up a little bit.
105.0,Provider,"So they were about 15 inches apart, maybe something like that. yeah perfect so So you see how my eyes are going."
11147.0,Patient,mm hmm.
105.0,Provider,"So what I want you to do notice i'm not doing this in the middle i'm not doing that I it's the. Left right, left, right that I want, so let me see you do that for just a moment. And just curious, is it possible that that left object is. you're sure you're dead Center in front of both you are Center you're not like this. you're sure. You got to have these two objects, so that you're either doing the same thing. or not. off Center like this okay what one more time. Okay, so quick it question is it straining your eyes. No okay that's what we want, so I think that's probably enough, there might be a time where I might even be able to change how close you are by if I just said, sit up straight that might bring a couple of inches towards that we might be looking for. you're fine for now all we're doing is the setup I want you to remember the way you have this setup right now. Because if I say hey let's do some em Dr today, you want to be able to pull this together, just like this. right away, because now, this time, you know you had think about it, like how we can put this together, but if we do it again, which it often takes quite a few sessions, then you'll know what to do. So the mtr that I do is attachment focused and Dr so it's complex it's got a lot of moving parts you don't have to know it all those moving parts are but it's very driven by the next invitation that I give i'll ask a question you answer it and. Whatever the truth is you don't it's not a talk therapy, where you explain yourself, you just answer my question and then probably i'm going to ask something else, and then. i'll ask something else and they'll ask something else it's not you talk for 15 minutes and I just listened it's not like that okay. it's different it's a different kind of technique. it's very guided by what my next question is. So it can feel it can feel a little different. So lets us will start this this targeting part we've got to try and figure out where to start. Just now, when you said hmm i've been diagnosed with ptsd. What was the event."
11147.0,Patient,"There was several my ex fiance had killed himself in my house and the next day, I found out, I was pregnant ended up having a miscarriage did that. Also, I was kind of like up in a hostage situation where. This guy will not let me out of the House, he put dead bolts all over I had to slowly cut the red ironed or piece by piece until I can get out an escape. He also broke me ankles. And then stomped on it, so I couldn't walk. I ended up escaping and didn't have anywhere to go my mother actually live right next door and it's going to her apartment and. He came out with a gun and started shooting at the House so."
105.0,Provider,"Goodness i'm so sorry this happened. When. What how how old were you with the the hostage story, how are you."
11147.0,Patient,Saying say about.
105.0,Provider,"Okay, and the ex fiance passing away. So. we're going to stick with just this empty arm and part of it is learning what your emotional thermometer is, for example, and I do this so frequently that it's. Probably already in your notes that's how frequently I do these so i'm going to open up the note we're going to start to put some numbers of intensity of distress. yeah so i'm going to show you something. See see this stuff right here it's already in here see these numbers."
11147.0,Patient,see if we can make it.
105.0,Provider,"about being able to read it it's more like saying that I do this so frequently. That I have these in here, so this is what i'm asking when I say the subjective unit of distress again this cmdr has a lot of like structure to it. So this is the thermometer so just now. When you think of distress of i'm afraid i'm angry things like those intense emotions when you think about ex fiance and the mixed miscarriage at age 21 if 100 is the worst most stressful situation that's ever happened what number, do you give this event at age 21."
11147.0,Patient,I am been say 100.
105.0,Provider,"Okay, so that's what way up here okay."
11147.0,Patient,"Yes, i'm also connect just reflect a little bit on that. For shy and. I didn't know, I was working out phrasing in the call Center and it losing my job because I. First of all, it was miscarriage but I was on medical leave. My doctor didn't saying in my information, but I also got bell's palsy. I was diagnosed with a nervous breakdown and bell's palsy which is like kind of like a stroke, but the left side of my face was literally drooping. Which. It took them like about three trips to the hospital for them to even diagnose it. And they had told me that vessel and my brain head or state or something like that and that lasted for about four months I had wear and I had had to take my clothes and. I mean literally just drooling on myself just because I had yeah and, on top of that, I lost my job and I lost. Everything. That situation."
105.0,Provider,yeah that's 100. found out by. was pregnant. and had a miscarriage the next day.
11147.0,Patient,"Well, no, it was like about five weeks."
105.0,Provider,"Five weeks later, thank you."
11147.0,Patient,"But also, family and they had broken to vows because I didn't want to go on the House if an offer my landlord I would pay or two months. In advance in rent because it was a crime scene, I didn't want to go and house and his family and it taking anything that was worth money he worked at a cell phone star sandwiches cell phones electronics computers TVs. Anything worth money so it's been like often on. With that family, they were nice to me when I was pregnant, but when I lost the baby. They can just like blame me for everything."
105.0,Provider,For the blame you for his death. yeah well.
11147.0,Patient,"But I was actually at work and he was with his friend and brother in law, and they were drinking and he somehow pulled out a gun supposedly they were playing Russian roulette but. Different stories about that that he had just grabbed the gun moved away from everybody and they try to get the gun away from him and he shot himself in that."
105.0,Provider,"Alright, so again that's at 100 this hostage situation about three years later, where you finally got away and there was also a gun shooting at your mom's House what number do I put that one out."
11147.0,Patient,"That one was very intense, I am going to also say 10 because."
105.0,Provider,Another absolutely okay so age 24. So this is some there's lots of again lots of things to do with this particular modality of treatment we've got age 24. And was this someone you knew this Was this a boyfriend who was this that was holding you hostage.
11147.0,Patient,And it was just a friend actually and. I guess he had started doing drugs started day math I didn't know anything about drugs back then and. I just noticed that you would like to stay up for days. And then he would start seeing things like the culture outside. If I go to lunch and go do laundry. Then it's just walk in the doors he. That is just punching he knocked out into my teeth and grabbed me by my neck and. took me till I pass out and then punch me until I woke up. And then throw water on me. it's very intense and then also the broken bones.
105.0,Provider,"yeah i've got he broke both my ankles and then. I only put and and. Never snow where to go. Okay, so just so you know this particular treatment. Even though you're sharing these stories with me now you don't have to it's completely up to you, it doesn't require you to retell them again. All there'll be times when i'll say something like this, Michelle right now I want you to hold the worst part. Once you to put it in your working awareness, but it doesn't mean you have to say what it is just means you have to be thinking about it, we think about our. Like let's say we have a desk and there's only so much we can do at one time it's like our memory. We have our working awareness and we can only hold so much in our short term memory, at a time. And so you'll hear me say okay Now I want you to think about this and then they'll be other things I want you to think about at the same time and it'll be probably two things sometimes it's three things at the same time, those are harder. But it is possible it's oftentimes it's a it's a body it's a somatic awareness. Remember, this is a desensitization practice it doesn't require you telling the story again and again to just so you know if it is activating for you, you don't have to keep retelling it. All you have to say is i've got it you don't have to keep retelling it if it is stressful I will tell you there's a lot of people. That need a witness they haven't been able to share their trauma stories and they want to so just so you know you're both welcome to and you're also welcome to not that is completely up to you okay."
11147.0,Patient,"But I think like a lot of it is coming from. Like runners up at the gas station when a guy that tries to approach me get very defensive. And just you know they shouldn't be asking for change your money into something like I get very, very defensive."
105.0,Provider,"Okay. So that's helpful because what activates you is. A perception of threat map based on these events in the past, so you have a trigger have you noticed that there's slight difference or big difference when it is a female."
11147.0,Patient,I do yeah I don't get as defensive.
105.0,Provider,"You still get defensive, even with a female but it's less."
11147.0,Patient,"And it's just I think defensive, because if my daughter's with me stuff like that, and sometimes some I mean. there's a lot of people on drugs anywhere you go. and I just don't like people like that approach to me, but you can't stop it, because it's everywhere."
105.0,Provider,"Right so let's get a number that goes with that a man approaches me notice how. Is those two events we talked about. How activated you're using the word defensive i'm going to use the word distressed. Because that's what this thermometer is it's a subjective meaning it's up to michelle's perspective, not one of yours it's subjective. So it's a subjective unit of distress so when when hundred others to events, when a stranger comes up to you a man what number does it get from zero to 100."
11147.0,Patient,"Okay, see probably about."
105.0,Provider,"7575 so that's pretty high so 75 so when a man comes up to me and asks or anything. I feel defensive. got it okay and we'll put that as a 75. OK so again what we're doing right now is we are targeting i'm trying to stay conscious of time. And also that you're going to have a job interview today, so I don't want to start it and activate it what you would call get defensive I don't want to really bring that on so i'd rather do that when it's safer and more contained, and we can do it all in in one hour. But I might be able to do one little one more piece of it let's go to this. let's see if we can do it not positive, we can. there. When you do think of one of those scenarios, whether it's the being held captive as a hostage. Or the the event, with your with your ex. pick one to think about right now, we will stay there for long you're not going to have to tell me more about it just pick one and think about it. When you have it in your head just nod your head, let me know. So what I want you to do is I want you to think about now we're going to move into. belief about the self you've done a little bit of it when we did some of our core beliefs and what are my thoughts and what are my underlying beliefs about myself. You touched on it a little bit we're going to do it again I want you to think about when you think about that event, you remember that event. What does it say about who you are and you're going to know what that belief about yourself is by finishing the sentence, I am. it's hard to do, but what it, what do you finish the sentence when I think about this memory. My say to myself, I am."
11147.0,Patient,I am strong.
105.0,Provider,"that's how you feel about it, would you say today."
11147.0,Patient,"Today, yes, a lot stronger than I was before, but, having just to deal with those type of situations and my major escape is just to run and."
105.0,Provider,"So let me command it slightly differently. When let's go to the the son of a man approaching, you ask you for change now I want you to notice with the I am statement is i'm what."
11147.0,Patient,"I am. Always on guard. Always I don't know like a different word for that, but i'm always. defensive because."
105.0,Provider,"we're gonna we're going to refine it we're going to keep going if that's true. What does it say about who you are. And what if i'm always on guard i'm what. You want to catch the first response if you can i'm going to help i'm right here so what's, the first thing that comes to mind. If i'm always on guard i'm what. These are hard to do, Michelle don't worry about it, sometimes it takes the whole hour there's no rush. So flip it around you can try it by flipping the perspective around if you saw you you're walking into a store and she looked on guard. What do you think she believes about herself. If you were looking at someone just like you. fly on the wall."
11147.0,Patient,guess okay.
105.0,Provider,"Okay, so she looks rude So what is she doing that seems rude we're gonna get there from here i'm not worried."
11147.0,Patient,I tried to stop them before they even asked like I can be.
105.0,Provider,Okay.
11147.0,Patient,And maybe like. Looking at somebody else I knew that maybe they could be a little bitchy.
105.0,Provider,"Those are behaviors so rude and Betsy or behaviors. So walking without judgment because we're going to get because remember our destination is we're going to get to two and I am statement. But we're going to get there by just answering as quickly and honestly, as you can my questions so this woman that you're looking at she looks fishy and rude. What would happen if she wasn't bitchy and rude what what happened to her. You see her there."
11147.0,Patient,yeah I mean she would get bothered for. For anything.
105.0,Provider,"yeah what would happen if she got bothered. For anything, what would happen to her."
11147.0,Patient,she'd be more defensive.
105.0,Provider,What is she defending.
11147.0,Patient,herself.
105.0,Provider,From what.
11147.0,Patient,From. Just being bothered.
105.0,Provider,So what's what's what's the problem with bothered what happens if she's bothered and then bothered again and bothered again what's what could happen.
11147.0,Patient,i'm just frustrated.
105.0,Provider,And what's happened so she gets frustrated.

11147.0,Patient,"And you don't want to talk to them you just. say. I don't know what they think but. I mean, if you think of. anything they bother people all the time, but maybe she's having a bad day when she's in a bad mood. But it should be."
105.0,Provider,So if you got angry what might happen.
11147.0,Patient,"be left alone. All right, be called names i've been called names before."

11147.0,Patient,from being approachable.
105.0,Provider,"Okay you're protecting yourself from. danger there you go so stay there now I. want you to go to I am if you're protecting yourself from danger, what do you believe about yourself. i'm what. You don't have to do it fast just stay slowly you've got minutes still got a few minutes to stay there with it. If there's danger out there i'm what stay there don't answer right away, and shall sit with it, if there's danger. I need my anger then you're what i'm what."
11147.0,Patient,i'm angry.
105.0,Provider,don't we already state stay stay stay um. that's my anger. I use it to protect is that right.
11147.0,Patient,yeah.
105.0,Provider,"What am I back here. i'm what. This is the anger, to protect from people approaching me and it works, sometimes if I let it down what will happen."
11147.0,Patient,Then i'd be. approachable. Then.
105.0,Provider,"It can then what would happen, and then, what would happen."
11147.0,Patient,I would be angry.
105.0,Provider,We already know. We already got that this down Angers down what would happen if you were approached first response Michelle that you're overanalyzing it.
11147.0,Patient,At the myself open to conversation.
105.0,Provider,"And then, what would happen. How would you feel will try feeling, how would you feel if someone was conversation with you talking to you. Your anger is down this anger is down right now, are you how are you going to feel."
11147.0,Patient,more friendly.
105.0,Provider,we're going to pick this up this needs more attention.
11147.0,Patient,Non paying hit.
105.0,Provider,"Your your I believe I could be mistaken, but my guess is you're thinking what just want to be or wanting here i've learned some things in growth, and I want to say the right thing I want to say this thing she's trying to get me to do. won't work it's gotta be and I think the problem is i'm going to have to go to body i'm going to have to get, but I want to spend more than a couple minutes doing it with you. So we did a lot actually we have the setup So if I say let's set up for em Dr you know that you got to have these objects, right here, you know 15 inches apart, I level that kind of thing. And about you know the distance from from face to shoulder here um and I just need to get at the the target we didn't quite get there, but super good we got three items on the sun. On the subjective unit of distress thing but there's still again it's an eight eight phase approach so there's a lot of moving parts to this, you did great, this is not an easy one to get to okay."
11147.0,Patient,"um. Other than all this is one thing that I wanted to mention to you when I do talk to Dr April. let her know like even cutting down cuz i'm. Being weaned off of two medications and. i've heard people on group say okay well, can you give me another week. Because it was tapering so good for me, I did that, with her and like I said i'm completely honest I know how to get the kind of medications that I want from doctors and she. she's not like hearing me she's like no we're dropping you, no matter what yeah. it's what."
105.0,Provider,Do you want me to do.
11147.0,Patient,"I don't know, maybe I should login a little bit earlier, so that we can hear because you hear a lot of my stress you hear a lot of my anxieties and when we do the check in process I tell her what's going on something's telling me something's wrong with my body I didn't feel like this. At the beginning. I just don't know what's going on."
105.0,Provider,"So I think it might be the offices you're checking in early i'm not there, I would say, Dr Gabriel i'd like to check in a little bit later when my therapist is here. Is that Am I hearing you but you want me there. Yes, Okay, and another thing. It might be that the three of us stay at the end yours has you're a very, very, very rare person that is still on a benzo there were years which she wouldn't prescribe it other physicians don't it's. complicated, so I would say let's give it time and so maybe right at the end let's do your thorough check in let's talk about this because you're on a unique protocol it's not one i've seen. Before so i'm curious about it, too, I definitely want to make sure this this treatment helps you. it's a delicate balance between your being afraid a benzodiazepine is. An miraculous substance few can replace that one except you're being able to do the kind of work that we're just starting to do, which is the mtr it's going to be this. Learning the skills on how to do it, but it does take time, but i'm hearing you there's there's a discrepancy you're picking up on how come this client is able to say hey i'm not ready physically and you can't and that that needs to be addressed."
11147.0,Patient,"yeah because she even told me she's like you're gonna have to find another doctor and. I said, well, I do my therapy with one and do my complaints with everybody right, so I don't know what's going on."
105.0,Provider,"yeah this is this is complicated, but I admire what you're doing right now, this can't be an easy thing in what's happening is, you may know, is this me drug seeking, I want to be accountable, but right it's a delicate balance and. She said she's human i'm human, this is not black and white stuff this is, this is a challenge. We can't tell whether something's drug seeking or it's really the symptoms are there, so it is challenging but I hear what you're saying, and I think there will be a solution that you feel supported, and I think we can do it okay when is your next group just remind me."
11147.0,Patient,Friday 11.
105.0,Provider,"Okay, so you may decide to. Do what I invited, which is i'd like to wait, can we talk at the end with all three of us have some confusion or, if you want you could maybe not show up early. and show up on time or five minutes in something like that it's your choice, but what's happening is i'm not there to facilitate and to to participate and and, in some way. it's up to you, I love the way you approach you never have to worry that you come across rude or anything you're very polite in your delivery. And I just think i'm wondering if maybe all of us meeting at the end might be the way to go."
11147.0,Patient,Okay.
105.0,Provider,"You might just say that say hey could we all three meet to discuss my treatment. I talked with one of her about it. She seems to be on board, can we all, you know, maybe the last five minutes or something that might be something to throw out there."
11147.0,Patient,Okay okay sounds good. Thank you very much.
105.0,Provider,"let's schedule another appointment get it on the books. are going to disappear here, I want to follow this up, I want to. I want to stick with weekly appointments with you this is this stuff can be pretty intense so let's cruise along here with some consistency um let's go to September 21 let's do this again, you can either have. it's wide open, so you can have 889 10 or 11 o'clock it's completely up to you what would you want next Tuesday."
11147.0,Patient,it's due to me do technical.
105.0,Provider,"Sure, so September 21 at 10am. And just have this setup. ready it'll it'll save a lot of time, because if we're unable to actually get to the target. Then we can start the bilateral stimulation okay."
