Moving month to month. I said so i'm not supposed to be getting cut back to every four days i'm actually supposed to be going up to every 30 days."
214.0,Provider,And just.
538.0,Patient,"They said I had a survey that i've had since I came to bright her health it's a one time survey that I hadn't done, and I say. For a while yeah I said, how could I have that. All this time you guys are just now telling me. yeah so listen."
214.0,Provider,"here's here's the easiest thing. deuce to Bruce let while also there's a there's a drug screen. missing. So there's a September reporting know October reporting so that. And because it's like at the end of the month, it gets really red flag that's another thing, but I know, Dr Malik. So here's the thing I don't know how I would yeah it says October still not. actually says October still not done."
538.0,Patient,"I. guess I could go look around the House and see if there's a package anywhere but I haven't seen walking. Out of town for a week like two weeks ago, so maybe I don't know. My wife, when we get off here and see if she remembers anything."
214.0,Provider,"Right, so the other thing is. That survey is cold er Q. You need to go on the bright hot website contact us go all the way to the bottom and fill out the er Q kill that already. rah. rah. it's crazy cuz your child even says to lower the care of intensity. I wish I had a better answer for you, but I do see the red.on that server I can't hold but i'll talk to Malik i'm writing. It and say listen let's just go, the only thing was this stupid survey there's nothing else outstanding i'm also going to update this try to once a month."
538.0,Patient,"Okay yeah he can so i'll pick them up because i'm supposed to pick him up today so i'll pick him up today and then i'll pick them up a Saturday. And then, as of Monday he can cancel the other to refill. And just write a new prescription maybe or something."
214.0,Provider,"he'll know how best like he wants to address it, but I just want to see something."
538.0,Patient,Another thing is he crying.
214.0,Provider,that's typical for opiate uses.

214.0,Provider,"Not well that's what I meant, but I don't see the narcan in here, I see strikes on."
538.0,Patient,"brokers, has it. I call kroger's yesterday. Make sure my prescription and they said well."
214.0,Provider,"You put in he put in a prescription for Naw Kham for the overdose and I think god's protocol, and it should be done at least once in a in a person's. You know visit with bright height, would you stay here five years a year, two months, everyone should have a night can kit this is pretty much protocol I wouldn't worry about it's a protocol thing."
538.0,Patient,I was just gonna put in my truck and keeping track that way if I ever saw anybody overdose like.
214.0,Provider,"I know it's yeah that's what most people do so, I see I see how we load the prescriptions, I promise i'll talk to you about that i'll talk to him about that. So what how many groups you go into now."
538.0,Patient,Every two weeks.
214.0,Provider,I just changed it. So the way it reads now is. Once for me. Twice for group. monthly drug screen so in November well yeah in November you've got to come twice to group that's it.
538.0,Patient,Okay.
214.0,Provider,Ah you'll see that the Malik twice in group so that makes sense and you'll see me once. it's crazy because you can see how good you've done and i've read diet is killed it.
538.0,Patient,They told me that i'm like do what.
214.0,Provider,I started I yes so here's the deal died October urine is missing and that's definitely a red flag at the last week of the month.
538.0,Patient,Oh yeah.
214.0,Provider,"Absolutely, if you if you. If you don't get it in, or you don't get a note that says listen, I never received the cub because it says the September we ship it doesn't even tell me i've told me show but September was shipped and done October is not done."
538.0,Patient,"yeah they didn't even yesterday, when I was talking to the lady and I asked her why i'm on compliance, the only thing she told me was that he argues survey she didn't even tell me, I had a drug test to do."
214.0,Provider,"No, you do it's open and and I know that's going to cause listen, one way or the other, whether you do it, or you get it on record that you never received it. I can look in your chart on Monday, before I get on with Dr Malik and say listen this isn't his it's there ever, and if that er Q survey is done you do that today, it will register by Monday I guess I listened to close the charts clean go back to give them twice a month. Because that's, the only thing I see."
538.0,Patient,"Okay. So will I be on twice a month or once a month, then."
214.0,Provider,"I got to see if i'll put you back on the once a month i'm going to like. Let me see what he thinks. Sometimes, leaving a doctor is dumb saying no I kind of got to bring the conversation of."

You tell them to go to the bottom of your char chart for care intensity I put a note there about what's what you're doing going forward and I put I send my name to it and the date we initiated. So we shouldn't have any compliance issues with attendance the urine and the drugs, the surveys, we just got to get on top of."
