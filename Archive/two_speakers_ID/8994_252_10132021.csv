You, but the whole point is is I don't fucking need them and I never have. I mean I moved out here in California like over 11 years ago, two grand and my fucking pocket and still here. mm hmm you know what I mean so like the thing is even before I moved out here, I had a whole fucking mind. I put myself through college, I was on my own since time like I was shuffled between my family needed some from like my whole life and. You know i've always been on my own, you know I you know was out of my you know, out of I was paying rent by the time I was 18 years old, and I could illegally assign a week, you know so it's like I don't really fucking need them. Right at the end of the day, and so I just like I basically just you know said, like you know by the New Year, you know after the New Year i'm no longer going to be working here. And I don't care. And the thing is is I don't care what I do I don't care if I work at trucking mcdonald's.

So i'm just you know, but I just like i'm taking my power back. And i'm not helpless. You know, and I am starting to feel better with my rib whole thing. Good and I need at least like two or three more surgeries and i'm not stupid, but by that to buy I all route group, but that, like in January, and you know after that i'm just you know just biding my time to get the Fuck away remember me. yeah I mean and it's like the thing is it's there's a lot of love between us, you know, but the thing is is you know I ain't gotta I don't want to live with her anymore, and I don't have to live with her anymore it's somebody else's problem now you know name in. Here you know with That said, you know the the passive aggressive bullying that she does to me, is very real and it is very abusive."
252.0,Provider,mm hmm.
8994.0,Patient,"And I don't care if you pop i'd rather you punch me in the face, then passive aggressive bully me. Okay, because that's undermining. And with my guy Okay, because I, you know i've been seeing him for a couple weeks now my whole thing is I don't want them interacting. Okay, so she is here, he can only be in my room, he is not allowed to come out he I don't want them ever meeting face to face, because the thing is is. I don't need him seeing what she does to me because, when it's not an accurate representation of my life. People my life, do not treat me like that Okay, the reason why this happened was because I got ill."
252.0,Provider,mm hmm.

To no wonder, I have no boyfriend is because, like legit like she's ruined every single frickin relationship i've ever had she even ruin my marriage. You know what a friend. I told her one day somebody who's going to do that to you."

252.0,Provider,everything's handed to her.
8994.0,Patient,"yeah I mean she's never had life come at her heart she doesn't know how to survive in the real world without her mommy Daddy and trust fund. You know um. So we'll see. You know um but The thing is, is I can't tell you that I mean we'll have to see because when I go to move out of here. Which my plan is to be, I would like to be moving out by summer or before some or even after summer I don't care it's around summer I want to have an idea of what's going on, does that make sense, like. Making I don't necessarily know if I want to move during summer that's why i'm like ah, no I don't think i'm gonna move during summer, but you know I mean it depends, you know cuz I don't want to waste my summer. yeah but we'll see you know, like, I will be either buying a place or getting a fucking. I don't care. or like renting a pod you know, having it shipped here, putting all of the stuff that I don't need and then go renting so I don't care I you know i'm. All I know is that I am going to start my life and that my life doesn't revolve around her. You know, and you know my whole thing is is like so after you know I have made that like you know transition of no longer living with her, I think, then i'll revisit whether I want to be friends with her mom. Because um. I don't know. You know, but I just. I think some of the things that her and her family done was really chic. You know."
252.0,Provider,They say when you told them that you were. Planning on finding something else.
8994.0,Patient,"um well The thing is, is, I never was planning on finding anything else, but things are going really bad and I was also like going through surgeries."
252.0,Provider,yeah.
8994.0,Patient,"I was going through, so I went through six surgeries you know my fucking ex beat the shit out of me. You know my mom fucking scumbag me again, you know, so I was like really mentally physically emotionally in a really dark place, and you know that's the whole point I mean and then during that time they fucked me over. So I got it from every like I mean I was bent over Fuck like a finger fucking you know. You know, like, I mean I just I mean it is like there's one trying to go in my ear and my know and it's like it was too much. You know, like it was just like oh my God like it's just a fucking, mind you know and but The thing is, is like I am a good person, and you know and then that bridal thing they solicited meetup they needed me, you know and so far, so good."
252.0,Provider,that's amazing.
8994.0,Patient,yellow yeah.
252.0,Provider,"So, like working there."
8994.0,Patient,"I love it I absolutely love working there i'm just you know, again I just I mean this is the beginning of my life i'm going to start with my designs. mm hmm i'm an artist and the thing is it's like you know they can go Fuck themselves. You know. I just I just don't understand what they thought they were going to do with me like you have me working for you, for over eight years you don't want to put me on the books. So how do you expect me to move out. Right, how do you expect me to get to qualify for a car loan right and the point is is just between me and you I would qualify for any fucking long. Because I have impeccable credit. I am I, if I put something on my card, I pay it off, you know, so I know I, but the thing is i'm not going to take that off. You know and i'm because my whole thing is, I want freedom from them. I want planning my escape so me taking on a financial loan or this that the other thing is really kind of fucking time."
252.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
8994.0,Patient,"I think that's what they were trying to do to me when they took the car away. And the thing is, is what they don't fuckin realizes I have a very proud walk. I lived in New Jersey, most of my life in the rural part where everything is 20 minutes away. was no via or most of my life because. A I don't really like driving. huh okay I hate it really I only drive when I have to. hmm so I can get around and, if I can get around in a rural part of New Jersey Pennsylvania, where there is no can public transportation. I think it around here because there's a lot of public transportation."
252.0,Provider,Very much so.
8994.0,Patient,"You know so The thing is, is that, and I think that they were like trying, but the same they don't realize like I am a certain way even my cousin when she came out here in August she's like yeah but are you like. You always have your license in a car, but you never really broke like I know. This is like yeah what else is new, you know, like I know right like because a lot of the time I just like I don't know if it's like a. Like a I don't know if i'm like one of those activists or something like or like that, but I rather do like you know, like carpooling I think it cuts it back on you know. pollution and I, you know I, I think that that is very important to you know consider and stuff like that um but The thing is, is just the way you know they did stuff was I just think that's fucked up. You know. And the thing is is like I can sit here and like I just don't even care anymore. Does that make sense."
252.0,Provider,yeah you just getting bored.
8994.0,Patient,"I feel like I like I mean i'm talking to you about it because it's like it's been a while, so I have to kind of catch up a little bit with where i'm at right now fully I just I can't change it, I can't meet them do the right thing I, and I don't fucking care anymore. Like it's it's whatever. Oh wow."
252.0,Provider,yeah. How would you in her been getting alone.
8994.0,Patient,"Okay, because it's very fake. Unlike now I just find myself being like to spell my. And just go make. um it's just fake. You know, because now i'm kind of at the point is yeah i'm going to be nice to you when I fucking mean something. I. can do this and then not. Long I don't know. i'm you know i'm because the thing is is like I just. showed you go for herself is for all I care and the thing is is like i'm done with the lies like I mean it's like obsessive compulsive of like what, why are you telling me I don't believe anything they fucking say."
252.0,Provider,yeah.
8994.0,Patient,"Like a lot of the time, like all all be like Why is she telling me this because it's like I like I mean and i'm barely listening to her i'm like okay I OK, I don't really care. mm hmm like no funds, like a like a girl like you don't need to explain and I don't care what you don't need to explain yourself to me I don't care I don't give a shit where you're going I don't give a shit what you're doing."
252.0,Provider,don't my business I don't care.
8994.0,Patient,yeah I got i'm doing my own thing. But the thing is that what I for me is important is the keep the people that I care about that are going to be in my life. away from her. and her family.
252.0,Provider,And so far that you've been successful.
8994.0,Patient,"it's been honestly man me and my guy are going good. You know and and I told them, I mean i'm like look like I really don't want you guys, you know I don't I don't ever want her to meet him. She ruined my fucking marriage."
252.0,Provider,How did that happen.
8994.0,Patient,"I had a head injury, I have patchy amnesia for six and a half years is very fuzzy time for me. um I don't really know. All I know is. She hated her. He fucking hated her. He he literally gave me an ultimatum."
252.0,Provider,So out.
8994.0,Patient,"he's like I do not want you being friends with her anymore period I don't want her around blah blah, and I was like go Fuck yourself you're not going to tell me who the Fuck to be friends with. Like who who do you think you are like like you're going to show me like, no, no. You like i'm going to do, like i'll do what I want you know. But it was that was the beginning of that."
252.0,Provider,mm hmm.
8994.0,Patient,"and I think me and him would have worked things out. But. I ended up moving in with her. And I think mean her him would have worked things out because I probably would, if I didn't get sick I probably would have never lived here with her, I mean him probably would have worked things out. I mean, I think I told you him and his wife hit me up on instagram you know, last year, or whatever like Well he he hit me up in April, or whatever, but she hit me up in December of last year. Like him and his wife and their baby live at one of my best friends bucking apartment complex."
252.0,Provider,Oh wow.
8994.0,Patient,"On into that. yeah like I mean the point is, is what I i'm happy for them. My ex husband and his new wife and their family either cute. I feel like it wasn't meant to be back then, when I was with him, I was very much in love with him and wanted to work things out, but it was her. And like just the things that I see. And, and maybe then at that time I didn't really realize it but The thing is, I also lived with her for a really long time, and she has ruined every single fucking relationship i've ever had sense. I think the reason why he got the way he was. Even low key heading me. Is because of her. And i'm not saying that he's this perfect person and it's all her fault, because he's an adult and he you know he's also was on drugs, which I didn't know you know, but the thing is, is, I think, when you are on substances. things get fucked up in your head."
252.0,Provider,mm hmm.
8994.0,Patient,"You see, somebody treating me like shit constantly. Well, the new thing that's going to be okay to you know cuz ship wires get you know, so I mean that's what I how I feel."
252.0,Provider,Okay.
8994.0,Patient,"Why why Why have I. Since 2013. been single. it's, not because I mean there's point, there was a point where I didn't I actually wanted to be single. But for the last few years and i'm going to be pretty bleak and probably since 2016. Okay, I have wanted to settle down. And every time somebody comes into my life, she fox it up, I mean in. I mean, she fucked up a lot of shit girl. And the thing is is I remember, I was like I was like now that I have went through repressed memory syndrome, now that i'm not in crippling chronic pain constantly because those surgeries have been working you know now I feel like my mind is free."
252.0,Provider,mm hmm.
8994.0,Patient,"And I can start connecting the dots and. This is a fucking serious thing. Okay, and and. But, really, though. You know I mean she hit me in the head in front of one of mine got my boyfriend's. Okay got thrown out of a fucking bar. did a lot of fucking weird shit to chase every guy ever like had a crush on or like the way. Okay, but the thing is it's not like I mean there everybody I know is like what the Fuck is wrong with your front. And it's like back then, I had a head injury i'm like. You know, but now it's like now that, because the thing is is she has trichotillomania okay and she's not medicated. No and The thing is, is when she was medicated for it, she would drink on the medication and get violent."
252.0,Provider,mm hmm.
8994.0,Patient,"Okay, but now she doesn't drink, but now she's not on the medication, but that doesn't negate the fact that she has a mental fucking disability or illness or obsessive come only pulling out the eyelashes and she. You know I mean. Look, if I was sitting there. Every time I got anxious I would pull out all of my eyelashes and half of my fucking head. I probably would need to be on medication now. yeah Okay, and just because she is going through a phase right now, where it's not that bad. doesn't mean that she doesn't have it anymore. And the thing is is there are underlying weird personality fucking disorders, with this check, you know. i'm fucking done, you know, but this isn't my problem. You know and i'm just in a really great place in my life right now. Like I feel. yeah I feel like i'm on my life is just about to start. yeah. It took me a long time to get you know to feel better."
252.0,Provider,mm hmm.
8994.0,Patient,"You know, like it took me a long time to figure out what I needed to. not be in constant pain and having muscle spasms and. Oh man, that was a long run. yeah. You know I mean it's not even over yet, but we're the place that i'm at right now is like let's just say. This was it I didn't even have options to do two or three more surgeries. I had a full recovery i'm happy i'm good. Good you know yeah I could get better you know and let's just see where I go from here, you know, but I definitely I know for a fact I do need a couple more surgeries. But you know they're not like pressing right now. You know that. I can wear my like you know braces to wear my rib doesn't pop out constantly and even if it does, I have a foam roller i'm getting good at popping it back in and. there's a lot more muscle tissue around that I mean it'll be it'll stay in place a lot more once I get like my. My hip done because there's like very little muscle tissue there's muscle rips there that need. fix yeah that needs to be fixed so everything can stack up on on each i'm sorry I have like really, really bad allergies and makers itching so. Oh i'm sorry, is it just."
252.0,Provider,You don't worry. It.

252.0,Provider,"yeah. Would you prefer mid I remember when you very first started. These were haven't been going well with a roommate and the other job, and you know you were in this. What am I gonna do stuck hopeless state."
8994.0,Patient,And I read start CAP right dislocated my rib to like in July.
252.0,Provider,mm hmm.
8994.0,Patient,So it wasn't like fully there yeah and i'm like oh my fucking like.
252.0,Provider,"Yes, a lot."
8994.0,Patient,"was like fallen down around me and i'm just like what did I ever do the girl like I The thing is, is, I really do truck. I got a good heart, I don't Fuck people over i'm not perfect here."
252.0,Provider,mm hmm.
8994.0,Patient,"All right, i'm not saying that I don't have my stupid things to, but I really like at the end of the day, I have a good heart. And everything just was falling down around me, and it was like, no matter what I was doing. Every just like everything was like piling on top. And I was like you know what but the thing is like i'm just kind of like you know, like when you just get to a point where like you can't take things for real because you're so overwhelmed violin all fucked up shit what's going on. yeah. So I just got to that point, I was like at that point and that's when bella's kind of like fell right into my lap you know, and I was like. Even now I get to that I get scared. i'm because i'm waiting for the other shoe to drop. Sure i'm a little timid i'm a little Shell shocked. And you know, the thing is is like I don't like. I hope that's not like that forever yeah because um but The thing is, I think it might be like that was me because, just because, like you know I am 38 you know, and I went through a lot a lot a lot in my lifetime where nothing worked out. Like anytime I tried to do something and nothing ever worked out so it's like to me now that i'm like 30 okay come on. Like I feel like my brain is just like hard wired after like 30 years. To like expect this you know and like take specs like fucked up shit to happen or stuff to not work out and like I don't like I. I I don't want to be like that, like that, like you know I kind of feel it sometimes I can't help it yeah yeah."
252.0,Provider,"that's a guard and you know the longer that you are working with these people and the longer that you, the more you get to know them, the more they get to know you you build that trust Jay and you will start letting your guard down a little bit with them. yeah they have to."
8994.0,Patient,"earn. nervous, because I feel like Okay, so this is like maybe. This is a good conversation actually because I feel like and i'm sorry to interrupt you, I feel like. Like I have personality flaws, or something you know what does that make sense, like. And i'm sure everybody does here Okay, but the thing is it's like look like I thought, like you know my roommate and I were going to be best friends forever and, like her family to and then it's like now, they can care less about me and it's like. It hurts it hurts, but I almost feel like. Can anybody just be like unconditional is there ever going to be, and then I was because I was thinking about this last night, and I was like wait wow. hold on a minute here. unconditionally my cousin and I are very close unconditionally me and my sister all of my friends back east. are still like. CAP. you're gonna as my roommate that and she just won't stop and she gets really fucking annoying after a while I just need to let it run. So yeah. You know I just feel like maybe it's just been a long time. Since i've been you know around those people. consistently. Because like out here it's like yeah I have like unconditional friends out here too, but because they're not 20 years or I grew up with them and stuff like that, like I. it's like they don't almost like don't count."
252.0,Provider,yeah.
8994.0,Patient,"You know, because the way that I need them now is not the way, like. It was for me and look let's just say candy or Jen mountain you know or aaliyah or you know, like all my like really close friends back East I mean because you go through this like growing up where you guys are so vulnerable and you meet each other. You know, and then it's like I just feel like out here it's never really been like that, for me, because I was older, I was an adult and I was already like I already had my shit on lock know so it's like. So it's a it's just a little different yeah but The thing is, is I would never like trade trade my friends out here either you know it's just I. Do I feel like if my whole world fell apart. Would I have would anybody come help me I don't know. Like realistically. You know i'm. You know, at one time it was you know I felt like that about Ashley and feel. But then look what they did. yeah but the thing is it's it's one thing to be like that, but then, why didn't you put me on payroll why have you been fucking me over. Like like. That that to me was like ice I don't like. And the thing is, I feel like it probably escaped my attention because Ai was can injured and helpless, but in a weird way, like my mom's back to me. And I think there's this level of acceptance. or tolerance that I. When I was going through the pain and injuries and the mental you know patchy amnesia the you know repressed memories and drum the forgetfulness, the I mean, I still have memory issues you know i'm. Not crazy, you know but i'm there's never going to be a time where I don't have to email myself every little thing sure. You know, or have calendars everywhere and make sure you know there's or put a million alarms on so I don't forget to do stuff that you know that that's not how I once was, though. Right, I could keep these things in my mind. and know that this is what I had to do without writing a list out. or without. Adding stuff you know so. But that's like, so I think when I was going through all of that stuff it was like almost like they probably were doing this stuff to me the whole time but I didn't realize it because i'm so used to my mom be like that. You know and and that's the thing I don't really understand like what their their bottom line was because, if anything, they've only fucked themselves over to."
252.0,Provider,mm hmm.
8994.0,Patient,"I mean, because, like realistically. I mean, if you want me to move out of here my fucking can. fucking morons."
252.0,Provider,mm hmm.
8994.0,Patient,"Like look, you know so so Okay, good luck getting rid of me. You want to get a car Well, unfortunately. I can't go in there and with my pay stubs here and be like hey well because i'm i'm not a real employee. This technically isn't a real job. And I don't have any because you've wasted my time for over eight years I don't have eight years of work history now. So I feel like they also Fuck themselves in a certain way."

8994.0,Patient,"they're fucking dumb what be your your cheer saving X amount of money, so you don't have to pay on like it's like you know because payroll costs were money to you know so basically every employee that you have on payroll. Like does that make sense. So even if they had to pay for me to be on payroll it's like yeah but The thing is, is then you could have got rid of it."
252.0,Provider,mm hmm.
8994.0,Patient,"How am I going to qualify to even rent an apartment at this point. Okay, the bottom line is you assholes are fucking stuck with me, for you know for a hot minute man."

8994.0,Patient,"collected so much fucking money last year from coded they fucked a thousands of dollars.

I don't want to fight I don't I just want things done right by me and if they're not going to do right by me, then I don't fucking need them, I just don't mean them trying to Fuck me over that that's it does that make sense, like I realistically like. And the thing is is they know that about me that's probably why they consistently have taken advantage of me because they know i'm not gonna like. You know."
252.0,Provider,"that's just a mess up situation you know it really, really is."
8994.0,Patient,"that the item of the day, they have to live with that."

8994.0,Patient,"Really yeah I you had to save that much pocket change off with me they couldn't put me on payroll, to the point where I insured your kids fucking car underneath my name. And you couldn't sell me a $32,000 car like I mean it's not even like it was like $100,000 lexus or a $50,000 like this is how stupid this fucking shit is. You know. But everything has been to benefit them."

8994.0,Patient,"Her is going to be, I really have this feeling next year is going to be the best year of my life. You know and and it's just it's one way up from here. yeah because the thing is I don't and The thing is, I never needed that and and the thing is is if I didn't go paralyzed in 2016. Okay Well, this is the fucked up part Okay, the reason why they don't want to make me an employee is because back in 2016 I got injured on one of their properties doing a falcon project. So my boss at bella's told me yeah well that's the thing if they ever make you a real employee, you can turn around. And do a workman's COMP against that."
252.0,Provider,mm hmm. So still pocket change compared to. You know what I mean.
8994.0,Patient,"You know, this is what i'm saying this is so stupid right it's like you know, but the thing is it's like I don't understand what they like what they gained from fucking me over other than. Bad Karma."
252.0,Provider,"well. there's a little more greedy. You know, people are green."
8994.0,Patient,"I mean unnecessary, but the thing is it's so unnecessary to me that it's like I don't get it like I don't understand like Why would you do that to me. Right, I mean no hard feelings on my end because my mom's done waivers. You guys are not my family and I don't fucking care. You know, and trust me i've been done dirty. You think they're the first people Fuck me over take advantage of me use me. He put me in bad situations make my life harder. they're not know. I think, have been and by far not."

In me and it's like. yeah. You know so dictation and you know no it's just like oh you're one of them. yeah that's how you are oh you're scumbag okay well i'm not going to be a part of that and I don't want to be I don't want to have my name associated with them, because if that's how they can would treat me or if they. What are they doing the other people's. i'm not the only and if they could easily do that to me they're easily doing that in other areas of their business or their life or and I don't want that association so maybe it's a blessing in disguise, I never was a real employee with them. In the long run. Because you know I don't look I don't want part of that bad Karma I don't want to look i'm trying to be a real person, a good person.
