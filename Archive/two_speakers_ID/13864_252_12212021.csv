252.0,Provider,not ready for that yet.
13864.0,Patient,"But it's like a little ladder and I always like to have somebody here with me. yeah it. may or may not have fallen off once or. At one time it actually flipped up on me, so I was like surfing in the air."

13864.0,Patient,"All right, excellent."
252.0,Provider,"Okay, so the first question is what brings you to bright heart and why now."
13864.0,Patient,"And I was. I stopped drinking in August of 2020 August 2 I had a lapse of six days in June of this year. And I went to the hospital. For to make sure that I didn't have any like side effects like dts or you know anything like that yeah while I was there, they gave me Prozac. And, or maybe it was a different. was a different antidepressant and I reacted awfully to it."
252.0,Provider,mm hmm.
13864.0,Patient,"I said I wanted to hurt myself, I wanted to die I don't remember any of this."
252.0,Provider,Oh wow.
13864.0,Patient,And I was placed on a they released me. And my sister called the police and. She she at the time I had given her prior to this. Power of attorney. uh huh and I don't remember her picking me up from the hospital like I was completely out like I don't remember anything.
252.0,Provider,Oh no.
13864.0,Patient,yeah so she called the police and they took me in for a 72 hour hold.
252.0,Provider,mm hmm.
13864.0,Patient,"While I was at the hold I was like I you know, I was out for like probably 14 hours. And when I when I woke up, I was like I have no idea where I am what is going on, I spoke with a therapist and the psychiatrists there and there and I was like I don't want to hurt myself that was never in my area of ideas or anything."
252.0,Provider,Bad reaction.
13864.0,Patient,"Bad bad like I don't even remember saying that thing those things to my sister at all. And we talked I didn't end up staying for the entire 72 hours because they were like. You know, we really don't think that you need to be here, you know everything that we're saying you're seeing and blah blah. They sent me home with the zoloft prescription and I refused to take it."
252.0,Provider,Data pipe but the fear.
13864.0,Patient,"of failure, it on. So. I found bright heart health to try and figure out a way to you know, maybe take some anti anxiety medicine and and talk to people about you know ptsd or an anxiety and the secondary alcoholism and you know. So yeah."
252.0,Provider,"awesome okay all right, and you know it's my understanding that there is a blood test that you can do in order to find out what anti-depressant would work, the best."
13864.0,Patient,"For you, oh really."
252.0,Provider,"yeah. um it came out a few years ago, and I think I asked Mary about it at one point because of it, because what happens is that they try and I depressants as a trial and error and yeah you know you have that type of reaction that's detrimental."
13864.0,Patient,"yeah yeah. It was awful and I actually ended up because I was so stressed out. Because my son lives with my ex husband now and hit my ex husband, he was an addict as well years and years ago there was 12 years where he barely spoke to her son and now he lives with them and he's talking very poorly about me as an addict. And you know cut contact cut visitation, even though it was against court orders. And so I took a half of zoloft and I, and I before I had called my son and my ex husband's like you're drawing, I can tell bone i'm like actually no, you know here's the here's the medicine they gave me. Like you know I think i'm having a reaction to it. yeah as much as I did, even though I only took a little bit of it. Only took half I was like this is, I i'm not drinking like this is it and so he put in court papers, you know, saying that I was drunk that I am irresponsible that i'm a danger to our son and i'm like. Like but but here's the thing. Like I just went to a meeting. 20 minutes ago, where I was in a group meeting with my counselor just down the street i'm there's no way I can be drunk or you know, like it was it was awful."
252.0,Provider,"Oh, my gosh i'm sorry experienced."
13864.0,Patient,"Oh he's an awful man he's an awful awful man, you know I tried for years to get him to contact our son just a text message saying hi takes two and a half seconds. Right and he didn't do it, and now he because he was an addict and was he was an alcoholic as well he's remembering things differently, or at least choosing to remember them differently and he's very much a narcissist you know gaslighting and all the things. And meanwhile I have emails of 10 years of me saying just call me when. You can you please just say hi. Can you just do this, you know in every time I present those to him he's like no that wasn't me."
252.0,Provider,"cognitive just did it's called cognitive dissidence. yep you know where you know they even when they're presented with the facts, they don't believe it."
13864.0,Patient,"uh huh yeah exactly so it's it's been awful and my son wrote a letter to the Court, saying that he's really happy and he doesn't believe that i'm not drinking that i've lied about it before and."
252.0,Provider,he's got the influence of that.
13864.0,Patient,"yeah and he's 14 you know. yeah so he's any he's always wanted a dad. And, but I refuse today because I didn't want to bring in a shitty ass person. yeah it was life. So."
252.0,Provider,"You probably did honestly, you know you probably did the best thing that you could have done for him by not doing that. You know, because being on the other foot of it, knowing that that's exactly what happens, we. bring other people in their life and they leave too, and they turn out to be worse and wearable and. yeah and it causes them and. So. You know he's getting to see his dad his biological dad for what he is and he might not see right now. yeah they will there will be a point where he will."
13864.0,Patient,yeah I know it just hurts now.
252.0,Provider,hurts now exactly.
13864.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
252.0,Provider,"Okay, so, can you tell me a little bit more about your. Your alcoholism tell me. How it progressed like age of first shoes and how you got where you realize you had a problem."
13864.0,Patient,"um I think I, my first time drinking, I was 18 I was at a high school party. But I was you know 4.0 student well 4.2 student like I. I was a princess when I was in school and everything like that. I didn't really start drinking drinking until. May 30. Like late 2013 I was. A restaurant manager general manager and I work 90 hours a week in a local pub. yeah. In South Carolina where things don't close. So you just you know. You get off a 20 hour shift and then you go have a couple of beers and then you go to sleep for an hour and then I was back in. yeah and then I got. Pregnant when I was 30 I was sober you know, obviously, when I guess not obviously not everybody stay sober when they're pregnant, but I totally was. mom and then was, it was still for two years after. And this is when we lived in South Carolina. And then we moved back to California my ex husband was a police officer out there, he came home and said I quit my job we're moving we're moving to California. wow I was like but I I just bought this second house for us. What are you reading. I think that he caught, he was caught using on on patrol. yeah because his best friend was also caught."
252.0,Provider,Oh.
13864.0,Patient,about a month and a half later so. I you know I think he just kind of hit it. We so we came out to California. And he tried to get a job with the border patrol but he couldn't pass the lie detector tests about drugs.
252.0,Provider,mm hmm oh wow.
13864.0,Patient,"Which. shocked me. So he started drinking heavily and then I started drinking. And then we moved to palm springs and. He drank heavily the entire time I was you know, often on because I took care of the baby, you know and. But it wasn't like I was drunk every day it was like he had a day off and i'd go and have drinks, you know. stay at home and have drinks. We he. stopped coming home. One night and just stopped coming home at night and. Had a child, with another woman before divorce was finalized. Oh wow and yeah i'm told told me and get the Fuck out of my apartment and take our fucking son with you."
252.0,Provider,wow.
13864.0,Patient,yeah so um so I had about 10 years off and on of. drinking. And in August 2020 I went to the hospital. Because I was having really bad abdominal pain.
252.0,Provider,mm hmm.
13864.0,Patient,"And my son was supposed to go to the neighbor's House well he. decided to stay home and the neighbor was just checking in on him. I ended up having three masses in my abdomen. And while I was there, the third day. I had DVDs I had no idea that I was that far into an addiction. I had the tremens and I don't remember anything for. Two days, three days after that. And my son was just being watched you know, instead of going to the neighbors like I had asked. The hospital called D CSS and checked on him and he was home alone during the day. Which wasn't a big deal, but because I had not. called my ex husband, who had been in his life for 12 years I got busted. I got in trouble. And they took my kid. To his dad."
252.0,Provider,"Who didn't want him and now he wants them. Oh, my God Sarah i'm so sorry. This is ridiculous if you asked me, you know yeah."
13864.0,Patient,"yep. But they have a good relationship now. And he's happy and that's what matters to me. I just wish i'm his dad when talk support leader. Right, and you know. I can't tell my son like oh here's all this information it cures proof that i'm not drinking that i'm doing all these things because. I gave all that information to the Court, you know, so I can't give it to my son. So yeah."
252.0,Provider,it's a lot.
13864.0,Patient,He just thinks i'm a liar and a loser now.
252.0,Provider,Give him time he's 14 very impressionable.

252.0,Provider,"Oh, my God."
13864.0,Patient,"and supervised phone calls. cuz his dad says that i've drunk every time on the phone and i'm like I don't. How do I prove that like, how do you know. Like you can say all you want, but I can say, all I want to. But because of the situation that happened a year and a half ago, the judges are still holding on to that."
252.0,Provider,Do you see him on zoom at all.
13864.0,Patient,"i'm supposed to but his dad won't agree to a third party supervisor, so I had to pay for it."
252.0,Provider,yeah he wants you to paper.
13864.0,Patient,"yeah and I can only do that, once a week, but because I lost any any job I can't afford it."

13864.0,Patient,"I grew up in fallbrook I don't know if you're not are you in San Diego no you're not in San Diego San Diego county so grew up it there it's a very small town. And my dad was a nurse Herman, so we had an acre with lots of plants and then he ran under St elsewhere, my mom was a stay at home mom. I am grew up with my little sister. My mom when I was 12 I started talking poorly about my father to me. You know, saying if we ever got divorced, would you ever come with me and like just making fun of him. So I started disliking my father, a lot. But we also grew up in a very tight knit family. My mom's parents my grandparents and her brother and his family lived in anaheim by Disneyland right across the street from each other. Oh every birthday every holiday, all together, whether it be here in fallbrook or an anaheim thanksgiving we spent up in big bear or family now then like we were very pregnant all the time was awesome. At 17 my mom and dad divorced. My mom was caught cheating with my cousin her brother's daughter cousins fiance. Yes, and and I also caught them as well, one night. and I started staying with my father, I was 17 so I could, in my my high school was in fallbrook she moved out of half hour away. And my dad and I became best friends. And I decided to step away from my mother, because she was very toxic. And I realized that at 17 that that mental abuse about talking about my father, and you know saying all these things you know she told my boyfriend at the time that she was done raising her children that was time for her now. my sister was 10. g's yeah. um so she did the same thing to my sister that she did to me, so my sister loved her more you know was more comfortable with her by talking toxic traits about my father. My dad got sick in November. He was diagnosed with cancer in when I was 20 he was diagnosed with small cell curse of small cell carcinoma cancer in April and he died three weeks later. Oh, my God it was his caretaker."

252.0,Provider,Oh good so you guys got your relationship.
13864.0,Patient,"So, but yeah it was the only reason I ended up starting talking to my mother again was because my dad had died, and I was trying to get my sister back. And then 2002 I moved up to South Carolina and that's when I started talking to my mom more because I was you know 3700 miles away."
252.0,Provider,You can always hang up the phone.
13864.0,Patient,But I have not spoken to her for years now again. Well she's very much an alcoholic as well. blames it on me because i'm the one that started her drinking same thing with my ex husband i'm the one that started him drinking because he came into the bar that I managed and I gave him a drink.
252.0,Provider,wow you I didn't know you had that much power.
13864.0,Patient,So Rebecca if you ever if I ever invite you out for a drink say no.

13864.0,Patient,"Yes, yes. Like it's just hysterical to me um so I haven't spoken with her in four years she said some very awful things about my son on new year's that are new year's Eve when night, she was drunk as shit. And I found out about six months ago she was admitted to a home because her roommate founder in a pool of blood, she was throwing up and. out the end because she was bleeding to death from her alcohol so she can't take care of herself."

13864.0,Patient,"um this past week and a half, I I haven't slept well in year in since my dad I am I get nightmares I don't sleep well, even though i'm exhausted. But this past week and a half i've been waking up at 230 every morning just drenched in sweat with anxiety attacks. And I think it's probably because of the holidays, you know, probably because of my age two and 45 so i'm starting to like feel the changes. So I think. I get got some anxiety rings. My anxieties big I you know I, I have a lot of anxiety and it's just and I don't know like I keep researching everything because that's who I am i'm i'm a brain person like I. You know I research I I could probably live at the San Diego law library because i've researched so much stuff i'm trying to get my case to get. um. But yeah I don't know if i'm just like anxious all the time, or like ADHD or overwhelming you know, like i'll start something. Like I started on my son's room, but then I move something into my bedroom I was like Oh, I need to clean that stuff and I, and I started doing that, like I can't."
252.0,Provider,Okay.
13864.0,Patient,yeah like it just in my brain doesn't shut off at night so.

13864.0,Patient,i'm not that i'm not a What if.
252.0,Provider,"Good Thank God. No that's huge, that is. The anxiety driving. yeah any water should it could take a look at any past memories that are popping up. Be self aware about that. Okay write them down because those are the ones that we want to develop a plan around to be able to stop. Okay, that is there really anxiety producing. it's really amazing because you know what we think. Controls how we feel. yeah so if we can and don't forget either that you're grieving. That can be a huge piece of this."
13864.0,Patient,"yeah yeah and my other therapists my old one she's like you have a lot of little T trauma. Every day. just saying his room every day yeah yeah it's not. You know I mean it was one traumatic thing but also just. All the memories in the House that's why you know, I was really proud of myself for starting it on."
252.0,Provider,"yeah very much, but we will you want to get to a point to what those memories are not when they're recognized or when they come up that they're not. they're good memories. You want to keep those in that these are good. yeah because these are mine and nobody can take these for me. Right yes and yes, you have to go through that grieving process and, yes, you have to cry and you have to feel but. When you look at them, you also have to laugh. And remember those in the good so it's about changing that cognitive part. yeah getting to that point where where instead of looking at them and connecting them with hurt, you can look at them and connecting them with joy. And that's a."
13864.0,Patient,process yeah.
252.0,Provider,"Okay, so paying attention to what you were thinking, but when you go to bed, maybe I don't know if you sleep well with a fan, if you can sleep, with some kind of relaxing. Oh, my gosh there's all kinds there's there's all the way to radio waves that you can actually. Go to that really kind of and they work."
13864.0,Patient,"I actually. turn on NASA. Because I love outer space I love the moon, and the stars. And I watched the international space station flying around and I look yeah."
252.0,Provider,"Good okay so you're already you're already doing things to help combat that. yeah so if we can get those thought processes changed, what are you thinking, what are you worried about. yeah it is is driven by either fear or her."
13864.0,Patient,yeah.
252.0,Provider,And there's a lot of hurt right there.
13864.0,Patient,yeah I don't think.
252.0,Provider,"Anybody would feel it, by the way. So you've got to know that all right um so identifying that so when you're having a hard time sleeping being able to really comfort yourself."
13864.0,Patient,yeah.
252.0,Provider,"Look at we are okay, I am okay."
13864.0,Patient,yeah.
252.0,Provider,"i'm doing what I need to do for me i'm doing what I need to do for my son. yeah not drinking and being healthy a minute Program. i'm doing all the right things. So you're doing is you're really just kind of affirming what you're already doing, and those are the messages that you start hearing. And those."
13864.0,Patient,"Right sorry, so if you see me looking over here i'm taking notes."
252.0,Provider,That starts changing those feelings.
13864.0,Patient,uh huh.
252.0,Provider,"yeah one one trick that I have done in the past two is. In my mind when I when I am there's things are going through my mind and I can't I just can't turn my brain off, I will go in and I will imagine i'm in a hallway. uh huh and you know because, generally, two and three and four things that we're thinking about."
13864.0,Patient,Right yeah.
252.0,Provider,it's just going all over the place.
13864.0,Patient,haha present soon.
252.0,Provider,"I will stand in the hallway and I will really tell those fears or her to whatever it is that's going on, but I can't stop thinking about it's time for bed, I need to go to sleep and each thought I will direct into their own room and close the door."
13864.0,Patient,And cool I like that.
252.0,Provider,"and close the door. And then I will go watch myself in my mind they'll get back in my bed, but my covers on. and say it is time for rest. And every time you feel one of them, trying to sneak out you just. Get back I need peace. yeah and it works, because I woke up the next morning going oh my God I don't remember sleep. yeah you know. I like that."
13864.0,Patient,"I yeah I used to do a 15 minute worries session like at nighttime and it works for me for a very long time, but i'm just because of the holidays and everything going, you know I just think i'm just. i'm I go to bed and i'd be like Okay, and I start thinking i'm like wait i've already had my 15 minute worries session today. I can think about these things bring them."
252.0,Provider,So you change that process from a worry session to gratitude session.
13864.0,Patient,yeah I like that yeah.
252.0,Provider,"Right you've already had your worries session so the new change it from that worry that negative piece to that positive piece. I want your body to feel that piece, and if you've got worries going on inside your head it doesn't it feels anxiety. yeah but you change that thought process. than that that's what your body's been abused."
13864.0,Patient,cognitive behavior.
252.0,Provider,Definitely it's amazing how much power brain really has.
13864.0,Patient,"It does that's why I really like smart recovery too because it's more based on like the science in the brain and that you know, instead of like. here's 12 steps and you got to give your mind to you know your class to a higher power and i'm like no this this shifts my car."
252.0,Provider,It controls this. um so yeah that's what I would do. Okay that's exactly what i'm recommending you to do and what's going to happen is you'll then be able to take control over that negative thought process. you'll be able to with practice stop it. and say I cannot go down this headspace. And then turn it around. yeah right. Read cognitive reframing is what you're. Talking about group it's just. You know it's about reframing what's going on. yeah so that you can have peace and your body can rest.
