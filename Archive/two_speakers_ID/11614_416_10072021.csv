416.0,Provider,Good morning RON nice to meet you i'm Julie.
11614.0,Patient,Nice meeting you.
416.0,Provider,"Welcome to bright heart. So I see that you've done an intake with us. Yes, and i'm a therapist so i'm gonna do like a therapy and take with. You a little bit different than the last one, you did."
11614.0,Patient,Okay um.
416.0,Provider,"And just get to know you a little bit and try to see if we can establish some goals. And so I read through the notes, so I know that you came to bright heart for some support around particularly around drinking. Correct yeah and. So, can you tell me a little bit in your own words about about your drinking and recovery efforts."
11614.0,Patient,"yeah so um long history of drinking, since I was an adult probably hadn't gone more than a couple of months without a drink and in the past. 20 years haven't even done that maybe 10 years so pretty much daily drinker heavy. And went into an Inpatient program about four months ago now close to it and. haven't had a drink sense."
416.0,Provider,Okay.
11614.0,Patient,yeah so.
416.0,Provider,How are you how are you managing. To stare to remain in recovery what's working for you.
11614.0,Patient,um I rarely have cravings and when I do I try to distract myself with some breathing or something like that. But really hasn't been a huge issue for me surprisingly.
416.0,Provider,What do you think is different this time.
11614.0,Patient,"I think I needed the Inpatient program to kind of kick start things because it was just so easy to in the past, every time I had a little bit of anxiety, so I have issues with anxiety and apparently depression to realize that but I started going on. Depression meds to when I went into impatient. That might be part of it, but. Anyway, I just never gave myself a chance i'd say you know I wanted to try to quit and I try and then it's just like something would make me feel anxious and I just turned to the my usual soothing. and And then I once I had that first strength and forget it i'd be drinking heavily that day."
416.0,Provider,No off switch yeah.
11614.0,Patient,"yeah and sometimes starting early in the day, typically not until afternoon, but sometimes earlier. And then pretty much almost like pass out drunk i'm you know with blackout quite frequently."
416.0,Provider,So tell me tell me a little bit about your life from like who do you live with.
11614.0,Patient,"My fiance okay very nice home. Successful in my career as well, but she's very successful in her career makes a really good living."
416.0,Provider,What are your careers.
11614.0,Patient,"She actually just retired as a principal with eli she's a management consultant. and But her retirement even pays pretty well. And i'm an industrial designer and also a part time college Professor. and iron designed for. business has been a little bit slow the last couple years but it used to be my primary source of income. Since my business is slowing on going back to school so i'm going to full time master's program right now, so that I can get my master's degree and then be able to work or get a full time tenure track position I teach at San Jose state and then pepin for 13 years. And they won't hire me full time it was out of masters so. yeah so going through the the basis on that one. Okay."
416.0,Provider,"yeah so really how it, how it is you're drinking affected all of that has it."
11614.0,Patient,"Oh yeah I mean I was just it's just amazing but it didn't you know really come to a crashing. halt or whatever. I was sometimes drinking, if I had late afternoon classes like drinking before class even. In my teaching and my first year of the master's program yes, that home so it's drinking. Even while I was in class I had some night classes. yeah so it didn't it wasn't good you think Pope it actually made things much worse for me like that was another turning point for me. And why I got into the program was because things got worse and also had this opportunity where nobody is pointing this me when I was gone and so it's during the summer I wasn't teaching I wasn't learning. My business is slow it's like okay everything's lining let's let's do this. yeah. How about."
416.0,Provider,How about the impact of drinking on your relationship.
11614.0,Patient,"Yes, a big impact, we have a great relationship, but I know that she wouldn't have put up with it much longer. She doesn't need that in her life. she's got it all together, and she can drink moderately but she doesn't drink it all at home with me or even when we go out she doesn't."
416.0,Provider,she's really issue really trying to support you in that way.
11614.0,Patient,yeah yeah she doesn't she goes out with their friends without him but but otherwise not. yeah so she's yeah she's very supportive and gives you Scott expectations of me that to get this together for sure.
416.0,Provider,Okay.
11614.0,Patient,"gauged we were engaged to be married then coven hit and so that was like almost two years ago now, and. I think she probably sort of changed your mind in the interim, with my drinking and now she's I think sort of like wait and see Okay, is he going to get it together but we're rescheduling our our wedding for me. Okay we've got a trip planned the south of France. So really looking forward to that. yeah."
416.0,Provider,sounds leveling.
11614.0,Patient,up the money for the Grand Prix to which is one of my bucket list things.
416.0,Provider,Nice okay very cool. yeah um alright so tell me a little bit about kids are.
11614.0,Patient,"yeah so I have a size was married for. let's say I can't remember close to 20 years I guess. And i'm divorced now 2016 divorced, but Americans really kind of over. A couple years before that. I had we had two stepchildren with that you know with with my ex wife and a good relationship with them very good. We have one daughter together have one daughter together and she's in her mid 20. Almost 25. she's doing well now with her career working as a. orthodontics office. I really encourage her to go to college she could even go for free because of my teaching and she was not. disappointed in that I don't like the guy that she's seen she's in a bad relationship, in my opinion. We have a we have a good relationship, but we used to have a great relationship. Just so close is amazing she's closer much closer to me than with her mother and. She even chose to to live with me. When we split up. And, but then I damaged that relationship by. You know the divorce kind of threw me for a loop, you know, was an unhappy marriage and my drinking accelerated and ended up actually getting in a fight with her boyfriend but she's currently with."
416.0,Provider,Like a physical fight or.
11614.0,Patient,"yeah yeah I got physical really big guy much younger than me and he ended up like nothing on the ground, I was he took he took the first first blow. But I was shouting has been a noxious was around because this stuff up again. And she's still with him, so our relationship is shaky I guess you could say I don't see her much, but when I do see there were fine. But I think she's kind of had to choose between the two of us and she's chosen her boyfriend. which I get."
416.0,Provider,"It but that hurts, though."
11614.0,Patient,"It does yeah she's she's you know she's most important thing in the world me, along with my fiance. yeah like I said, we were incredibly close. Together, just the two of us for a few years. yeah and."
416.0,Provider,What about um you mentioned that you have to you had to step kids are you still connected to them or no.
11614.0,Patient,"No, not really the older one female she's probably in her early 30s now I haven't seen her in a. few years, maybe five years and it's been mostly on my part, but i've been avoiding her because she's been in and out of jail and. hanging out with hells angels and drug dealers and stuff like that I don't want her in my life. When she said problems all her life, something I think she's got definitely psychological issues. But anyway, so I purposely have not had her in my life, although we had a good relationship. Before you know back when. My step son, we had an outstanding relationship we did so much stuff together and it's really close and. And then I think and then he's he hasn't been in contact with me much. Since the divorce, I think he kind of maybe maybe started with his mom. and divorce. And so I wish I had a relationship with him, but."
416.0,Provider,I hear it there's a theme here about relationships with you there obviously really important to.
11614.0,Patient,"Your I don't you know I don't have one good friend that's it. And that relationship that friendship is still very solid i've known him since grade school. and, beyond that, just really sort of business relationships that turned into somewhat friendships. But that's about it, I there's a few people in my life that are really important. And and that's about it, I don't have any really other social outlets or anything. I haven't told my best friend that I stopped drinking yet he's been he's been traveling in Europe and. We only saw each other, maybe once a month anyway there's a little bit of distance between us. yeah but that'll be interesting that we're going to class reunion on Saturday so i'll break the news to them, so that can be that doesn't need a driver."
416.0,Provider,So we should talk about that to talk about it.
11614.0,Patient,"yeah well you know I have survived my fiance had a graduation party at the House, and there was a DJ a bartender about 50 people in our House big house, but still. And I managed to get through that evening without drinking I talked to the bartender before and asked her whenever I come up their hand me a virgin pina colada she did, and so I I drank those all night."
416.0,Provider,Okay.
11614.0,Patient,"I know i'm not supposed to do either of those things, but I just. I wanted to be a part of the occasion. yeah my fiance wanted me to be there. They all knew that you know she was engaged and she thought it'd be weird if I wasn't in attendance."
416.0,Provider,"So I mean it sounds like you, you plan ahead."
11614.0,Patient,mm hmm.
416.0,Provider,You it wasn't to the it wasn't the safest situation for you to be walking into in terms of your sobriety but you plan ahead you stuck with the plan you got other people on board with the plan you communicated well like actually i'd call that a. Pretty big win.
11614.0,Patient,yeah yeah actually happy about that.
416.0,Provider,"yeah yeah we can't always avoid those situations, I mean it would be helpful if we could but it just doesn't work that way right."
11614.0,Patient,"yeah now the reunion, will be a little different. Well yeah it'll be different, just because I think i'm a little bit maybe more anxious about that situation. yeah and and again it's just kind of brings me back to my high school days when you know definitely drinking then to. yeah and doing drugs I started doing cocaine my senior year and continued my early 20s."
416.0,Provider,Okay.
11614.0,Patient,Wait one point but anyway so that's kind of who they know my well.
416.0,Provider,yeah.
11614.0,Patient,high school friends yeah.
416.0,Provider,So um let's put a bookmark in that because I think we should talk about that since it's coming right up. Before we.
11614.0,Patient,Before we end the session okay.
416.0,Provider,"let's come up with a plan. Okay, so. let's talk about let's go way back to the childhood where did you grow up and who did you grow up with what was your childhood like."
11614.0,Patient,"yeah so I have an older brother and sister. my sister seven years old and my brother. my brother and I actually once I became more like a teenager we would actually go out together, even though he was in his 20s and I was in my teens and drink together religious law kind of stuff between 16 and 25."
416.0,Provider,Did he connect you to drink in for the first time or.
11614.0,Patient,"yeah yeah he bought bought me the alcohol. and We still a good relationship. yeah so that's that's all all great, although we have distance right now, he lives in Austin Texas and. he's he's dying from smoking and he's 10 years older. than my sister incredible relationship with her really close she was kind of like a surrogate mother, in some respects, because my mom was a very heavy drinker. And she you know get through dinner and then pretty much pass out after that. And she was at home when I come home from school and she was also a chain smoker. In the House of the clicker saloon or something just filled with smoke and it's embarrassing to bring friends over. My dad had other outlets you play handball and things like that and. He drank moderately he didn't have a problem drinking at all you can sort of take it or leave it. But I don't think my mother and father had a very good relationship, looking back, we didn't spend much time together, but she was one that was with me after school, you know all my all my life."
416.0,Provider,And would she be she be drinking the whole time.
11614.0,Patient,"She didn't drink until afternoons, and then, but then again to get through making dinner, you know and things like that, and then she pretty much be out after that. yeah so yeah so kind of choose loving kind person not a mean drunk at all, just like almost the opposite she she had big issues with anxiety and she was molested by her father. And anyway, so I choose loving, caring wonderful wonderful woman, but that's what she's my you know my connection when I was young, you know first I spent the most time with."
416.0,Provider,yeah And what about any abuse or neglect and your childhood.
11614.0,Patient,Did you say.
416.0,Provider,yeah abuse or neglect I.
11614.0,Patient,"mean it's definitely something to collect on your mom's side. yeah definitely neglect again I you know nothing intentional on her part, definitely very caring person loving person I never heard her say a swear word or anything bad about anybody. But but yeah definitely would like to me, my father, he and I had a wonderful relationship, even through college, he was reading my college books with me and we've had discussions about them and. He was a voracious reader and learner, even though he never got his college diploma because my mom got pregnant and he quit. college and. started working full time and did so, the rest of his life. very intelligent guy. Caring loving. Wonderful man, I really miss it. it's like my name to."
416.0,Provider,How long has he been gone.
11614.0,Patient,"Yes, it's close to 10 years now."
416.0,Provider,"Sorry. Okay, so um you're in your sister is she where she now."
11614.0,Patient,"She lives nearby I moved from I grew up in livermore and that there, most of my life, and I just moved to danville on if you know the area at all, but."
416.0,Provider,I doubt it well yeah.
11614.0,Patient,"And she's a school teacher in livermore and we're very close she she got cancer, a couple years ago and at that time, I still living in livermore and we went for. Long walks while she was in recovery every day like four hour and a half, two hours, and it was good for both of us if my health to my mental well being cheap again she kind of helped raise me. And yeah just incredibly close, although she's. two twin boys she's single. And she's planning moved to sacramento and her life really now revolves almost entirely around her her sons."
416.0,Provider,And a younger.
11614.0,Patient,"know they are they're they're in their. Early 40s. But their skill, both on married she's never married and she's kind of like glommed on to them as her you know her relationships in life and so they're moving to sacramento because they can work from home now and that's where they went to college. gotcha and she's gonna follow them up there, so she won't be in my life at all and. Essentially."
416.0,Provider,From.
11614.0,Patient,"yeah it's not too bad just we don't visit that much it's mostly holidays now i'm. Not quite sure why. But it's on her part that she's not receptive to visits and things like that, so I don't know what that's all about. This is kind of become sort of a private person. she's also a drinker although she doesn't drink until evening, but I know she probably drink said I bet she gets a bottle of wine at night well she's still teaching school. fees let's see I guess in their. Late 60s. When she's going to teach one more year will be the teacher very healthy person, other than the fact that she drinks at night."
416.0,Provider,"alrighty so Okay, and then tell me about your sort of your mental health history yo when was the first time you really notice starting to feel any kind of like depression or anxiety symptoms."
11614.0,Patient,"I have had anxiety I believe all my life. I would pick up my nails or bite my nails. I would drink to kind of relax. Those my reason for drinking, I think, primarily. It wasn't until maybe. And years ago that. No more like 15 years ago I went to a therapist for the first time. Because I That was when I was having problems my marriage to and I just thought that they'll do this and try to try to help Maybe she could help me get a hold of my drinking and. Then. A lot of people were telling me that they thought you know I suffering anxiety that should get some meds I should see a psychiatrist so I did that about 10 years ago and he wanted to prescribe. antidepressants and anxiety meds and I thought well i'm not depressed i'm really happy, you know my life is great my career was booming business. But a great relationship with my daughter, and all that not so great, with my wife, but anyway. So I was receptive to the anxiety meds though i'd realized, yes, I am an anxious person, and so I took the anxiety meds seem to help a little bit I rejected depression meds. And then, when I went into the Inpatient program they put me on depression minutes. Well i've heard that from to psychiatrists now. That I need to be on the meds and it seemed to make a world of difference. uh huh and so i'm continuing with it now, I saw my psychiatrist when I got out, so I guess you're right."
416.0,Provider,I love hearing that.
11614.0,Patient,"Because I don't feel depressed but I didn't feel depressed. So I didn't really get it, but. What i'm doing better now."
416.0,Provider,"yeah probably. Well, I mean an alcohol is a depressant so it will mess with your serotonin levels so antidepressant antidepressants do help. A lot and they often help with anxiety as well, so. Okay, and."
11614.0,Patient,"Have me on a cocktail of drugs, when I was in patients and oh yeah yeah and i'm only taking the. Other one antidepressants and then, and then the one anxiety drug. And then I guess i'm still taking naltrexone also."
416.0,Provider,Okay janelle traction and healthy and that's probably why you're not having the big craving.
11614.0,Patient,"So I don't know because i've been on it for a long, long time. So I don't know, I think the anxiety meds I don't really know their impact, the only change was the antidepressants and."
416.0,Provider,"So. What prompted the Inpatient was there, an event that happened that."
11614.0,Patient,"are no just that I had planned to do that for the longest time I was waiting for an opportunity that was then there's always a reason why it wasn't the right time to do it. And then, when I kind of realized that I really want to do this and I, I asked. My hmo people to try to find me an Inpatient Program. And, but I wanted one that was. cvt knowledge based. And they couldn't find anything for me and I couldn't find anything on my own, that would be accepted with my insurance and then, finally, I found one that was near my home. Like said the stars align I was summer break, my business was slow, so it wasn't teaching it wasn't learning. My marriage or my feet my wife's considered a marriage going down hill because my drinking looks like okay i'm done with excuses now, this is my opportunity i'm going to i'm going to do this. Unfortunately, is supposed to be 30 days I felt everyone was telling me I needed 90 or more people that you know healthcare professionals that knew me well. But they actually made me leave the program after 17 days, because. They said I was, I was fixed. Insurance insurance. insurance company would you continue pain, because they were you know, reading the notes from the facility, and it was looking like I was doing great so let's look at got to turn them loose."
416.0,Provider,"Well okay. that's interesting i've never heard of that happening before, but I believe you. yeah insurance."
11614.0,Patient,"mikey way of saying you know you shouldn't be saying those things, because I was saying, I feel great you feel better all my life. And they're saying you shouldn't have been there that."
416.0,Provider,gotcha.
11614.0,Patient,"And then I went to a good an outpatient. Intensive outpatient program with them, five days a week, three hours a day. And did that for about a month and I loved it and then, once again, my insurance company. wouldn't wouldn't, allow me to do it. When I started teaching because I couldn't attend. Can before five so anyway, I tried to find that one a program that could do, maybe once a week or three times we kind of worked with my schedule. yeah, and so I had to leave that to so now i'm left with almost you know no support. once a month and then. While i'm seeing you."
416.0,Provider,Okay.
11614.0,Patient,"I don't I don't do meetings, mainly because they're kind of inconvenient because I like to go to either smart recovery or life right. uh huh and I."
416.0,Provider,Have those online now right.
11614.0,Patient,what's that I. don't think i'm online. yeah so i'm like don't have an excuse on that.
416.0,Provider,"i'd love to see us build into meetings for you in between our. So we can make that a goal, maybe. To start with some of that."
11614.0,Patient,up right now is going to. Taking a full load in the master's Program. Also teaching two courses and running my business i'm super busy. So that's I know that's going to prioritize getting well but. Those things are also really they won't wait for me i've got to show up to class got to be prepared i've got to do my homework and it's it's a lot of homework.
416.0,Provider,So you're also scheduled with us. For group.
11614.0,Patient,Yes.
416.0,Provider,once a week and you haven't made it yet so. Do you know about.
11614.0,Patient,yeah that's tomorrow right.
416.0,Provider,"And yes, it's tomorrow."
11614.0,Patient,"yeah I guess I misunderstood that I didn't think it was starting until this week. Okay, so I started this way."
416.0,Provider,"Okay, this is so, this is what we call a dual diagnosis group which is it means it's a it's a wonderful group actually that you're joining it's really amazing people are in that group, so I think you'll fit in perfectly. I run it with chantel and so i'll see you every week in that group. And then i'll. i'll see you every two weeks individually as well."
11614.0,Patient,So.
416.0,Provider,"you'll give me like six times a month and the groups are very much skill based which is definitely all cvt like you're saying. very much like cvt skills, a lot of support, but if we are asking like I asked people to kind of practice their skills in between sessions. And, and because it's dual diagnosis we're addressing we definitely address the recovery aspect of things and everybody in the group is in recovery. And everybody in the group has underlying mental health stuff to that they're working on so. We address both and almost everybody is anxiety and depression and like you. Are kind of similar, so I think you'll find some kindred spirits in there and they're lovely and they're all in different stages of recovery. Some definitely have alcoholism or drug of choice, so you'll you'll fit in nicely you'll be able to relate."
11614.0,Patient,"Oh yeah I forgot to mention, too, that I did meet some people when I was in an Inpatient Program. One who lives close close by, and we got we got to really get to know each other really well, we talked about getting together afterwards and. He goes to a meetings, right here in danville and he invited me to go and again i'm going to a but but we get all he said, we also get together for coffee whatever I haven't taken them up on that site that's another I think for my to do list I should get together with him."
416.0,Provider,there's this thing is sober community is going to be important for you. yeah definitely well so okay. talk to me real quick about or maybe not really quick about. about any kind of suicidal thoughts or ideations or anything like that that you've experienced in your life.
11614.0,Patient,Never my entire life okay cross my mind.
416.0,Provider,"or any self harming behaviors other than the drinking. Okay, good."
11614.0,Patient,yeah drink afterwards.
416.0,Provider,"yeah can drugs so and back to the drugs part, so I mean you, mostly talked about drinking, but you mentioned that there were definitely some sports of cocaine and there."
11614.0,Patient,"there's there's a few years for yes doing a lot of cocaine is selling it to support my habit i'm just doing it, the daily. mice mice my senior year and a junior and senior year in college actually. yeah so. Okay do it very heavily was able to support my own habit to those selling and so it's doing a lot."
416.0,Provider,But how did she do that.
11614.0,Patient,my sister threatened to tell my dad. because she knew I needed an intervention and she knew that was the thing I wouldn't want to disappoint my dad he was really against drugs and he was the most important person in my world at the time. boy I quit.
416.0,Provider,Okay. and any other.
11614.0,Patient,Country go ahead i'm sorry.
416.0,Provider,that's okay any other drugs.
11614.0,Patient,"marijuana but I didn't really I did a little bit in high school and then I didn't touch it until just maybe two years ago, because I thought, well, maybe I can smoke, instead of drinking that'd be less harmful. But it didn't take the place of it, I just did them both. And so, then I decided out i'll put that too so and I was doing edibles because I didn't want to get cancer, I had bladder cancer, and I think that might have been because I smoked for. About 10 years. And they think my bladder cancer my was probably caused by the smoking, and so I didn't want to smoke marijuana so I mostly did edibles but wasn't effective so i'm not doing that anymore. No other drugs, and I think a. little bit of speed I guess crank whatever, but those yeah again when I was in my 20s long time ago."
416.0,Provider,"All right, um let's see what am I missing here. What else what am I missing am."
11614.0,Patient,"I missing anything else that's significant. I don't think so, other than I really feel like i'm one of the things that would that I need is a bigger. circle of you know it's I really again, I have my one best friend who I see that every other month. I rely on my fiance for everything my social life, you know and so anyway so that's my I see my daughter once a month, if that. I see my sister mostly on holidays. You know so yeah I need to really expand that part of my life I think and that's so that's maybe something I didn't talk about in detail, yet."
416.0,Provider,"Okay, so a goal let's let's start talking about some therapy goals right, so this is what i'm hearing so tell me tell me if i'm getting it or if I need to adjust this i'm hearing ways to manage anxiety that don't involve drugs or alcohol. And so yeah just how do we manage that, and probably skills around so in general, just skills around mental health and wellness. That you didn't get growing up, because your family didn't have those skills also. and Bigger social support network, and preferably a social support network that is connected to a recovery community. So that it isn't doesn't become a trigger. And then you have personal goals that we want to support as well around finishing your masters and. Being a tenured faculty and all of that."
11614.0,Patient,Right.
416.0,Provider,Did I miss anything.
11614.0,Patient,"No, I think that's yeah you really captured at all. yeah see I can read my notes here because I was trying to write and looking at the same time. For mental health skills, you said, I think. That right, what does that mean."
416.0,Provider,"So in cognitive behavioral therapy. which you. mentioned before cvt is it's very skills based it's. it's a lot about finding ways to interrupt unhealthy thoughts, because these spots, whether we're conscious of them or not often lead to the unpleasant emotions. which then lead to behaviors that we don't like which then, once we have the behaviors we have thoughts about that, which then you know you start to spin. So. it's about interrupting that spin a lot of it and finding ways to do that, so we do we do a lot of that. We do a lot around interpersonal effectiveness rate so skills about. addressing problems with other people expressing ourselves in healthy ways we have a lot of skills around emotion regulation so when big emotions come up what do they mean, how do we interpret them, how do we handle them that sort of thing. How do we cope I don't really like. code, but."
11614.0,Patient,"sorry to interrupt but one of the things that I have done is, I have a couple of meditation Apps mindfulness. Perfect those are great, but I just I forget to use them. I get like you know complacent because, like oh i'm doing fine I don't need those things, but I should actually make that part of my routine same thing with reading like who's the power of now guy. I really like."
416.0,Provider,I forgot his name but yeah.
11614.0,Patient,Then fishman to I really liked a lot. So I needed. A meeting the meditations the breathing. I know all that and I just don't do it because i'm I feel fine so.
416.0,Provider,"A lot of it is about mindfulness yeah and it's about so what happens over time and especially with you because you have a long family history. of coping and unhealthy ways right. It was what you were taught from a very young age. And so what happens in terms of our brain is that when we grow up like that, and then we start doing that, especially from a young age than our brain tells us when something happens, this is your go to. right which is. that's why addiction happens because your brain has a direct pathway literally a pathway a neural pathway. And so, thankfully, we all have very plastic brains our brains can. Our brains can fix ourselves so when we get in those ruts once we start practicing other behaviors it feels really awkward in the beginning it's really hard to remember to do them. it's really outside of the norm, we don't feel like we have mastery over those things it feels hard, but then. The more we do them, the more we develop those new pathways the new healthier pathways. So a lot of it is about that it's about developing those new pathways and it takes a lot of practice, it takes time. But the more we do them, the more easily, we can access them when things go wrong right, so the more we do them when we're healthy, the more those pathways are available to us it's sort of like a road that doesn't get plowed."
11614.0,Patient,mm hmm.
416.0,Provider,"Right and then, the more we drive on it it's we're sort of naturally plowing that road."
11614.0,Patient,Like that metaphor that's good.
416.0,Provider,"yeah so that, once we once we get going we're on a nice clean road. versus our old road which is deeply read it so once we get in that old road we're stuck in those deep breaths and it's really hard to get our tires out of them. Right, so we gotta plow plow new roads in our brain and that's literally what we're doing so those. They are neural pathways right there. Are synapses and they get stronger, the more we practice any behavior whether it's a healthy behavior and unhealthy behavior or a healthy way of thinking or an unhealthy way of thinking we strengthen those synapses every time. So when I talk about skills. Every way. Every time we practice those new healthy skills we we strengthen those and then eventually our other ones dissipate they might still be there. But though they're going to get a lot of snow on them right they're going to have a snow Pack and they're not going to be as easy to get to and our other ones will be our go to. um so. yeah our brains are fantastic and magnificent and they do these wonderful things for us but understanding that it's important, because then it helps us realize how important that practices right. And practicing. practicing these things when it's easier to practice them versus when things are really falling apart. Oh randomly happens right so that they're available to us when things fall apart."
11614.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
416.0,Provider,"So there's a ton of skills. tons that will work on and we do a little bit each week in group and then based on your goals will select some skills to work on that will help you meet your goals but mindfulness is up high on my list of skills, particularly with anxiety because, with anxiety, the way it works is. anxiety sort of by definition right is either worrying about something that has never happened. And and over and over and over again spinning about how it might happen, and what if what if and. Whatever oh my gosh let me plan for something right it's about either worried about something that might or might not ever happen in the future, or it's about revisiting our past and stressing about something that maybe happened that we're revisiting that we can't change."
11614.0,Patient,Right yeah right.
416.0,Provider,"But what it's not as being in the presence it's what it's not as being right here present in this moment, and in our bodies and so mindfulness is is the answer to that. mindfulness is the key to that to being very present and connected, it takes us right we can't be stressing about the future, when we're truly present in the moment."
11614.0,Patient,Right. yeah yeah let's let's that's good makes sense.
416.0,Provider,yeah.
11614.0,Patient,"yeah and I think one of the things that was I was dealing with when I was drinking, too, is part of my anxiety was worried about what was going to happen in my life that my fiance we decided to leave me that I lose my job that I get pulled over for a dui and end up in jail. And so that worry is gone, which is really wonderful I just I really feel like my anxiety that's so much better, along with the meds. I think it's this this weight has been lifted off needs i'm not constantly worried about somebody noticing my breath or again getting pulled over whatever it's like looking over my shoulder and and i'm not don't have to do that anymore it's a wonderful feeling."
416.0,Provider,"So let's build some skills, on top of that, to just keep that pathway."
11614.0,Patient,mm hmm.
416.0,Provider,I think that sounds like a really good plan. awesome um so let's see any other questions for me.
11614.0,Patient,"No other than you said that we're going to see each other once every other week right. yeah is that because of my insurance company that's not more frequent, or is it because of bright hearts policies or."
416.0,Provider,"yeah it's pretty typical for our care intensity, I mean if you Oh, we simply don't because we see each other every week and group already. Right usually this is usually kind of how we start people if somebody is like in deep crisis will will do. will increase the frequency temporarily. But you know it would just be sort of a temporary thing just to try and get better crisis but we find that this is a good amount to actually between the groups and the individual sessions and people who are needing skills and but like otherwise kind of not in crisis. and find that this is a really good amount. But I will ask you and I do, I hope it can be a goal of yours to have meetings outside of our group and smart recovery is fantastic and any of those, but I would say. Since you're feeling pretty good, I would say, at least twice a week to hit a meeting. And then you'll have one meeting with us and then you'll have every other week with me individually and that's that's a good amount of I mean that's basically equal to an outpatient Program. Intense about Asia."
11614.0,Patient,"yeah and even found an Inpatient or in person meeting for life ring in walnut creek. it's uh yeah so they meet outside. But anyway, i'm looking forward to that one for sure it's on the weekend, so it works with my schedule, so I need to check that one out for sure. I didn't do that one in person, though we might two. Meetings a week."
416.0,Provider,"there's a V2 and then and then your Friday mornings with us. Fantastic that sounds great I love it and so having said all that, and. What do you think should we get scheduled."
11614.0,Patient,yeah sounds great.
416.0,Provider,"Okay, so let's see um okay today's the seventh so two weeks out would be."
11614.0,Patient,21st.
416.0,Provider,"And what do I have that day, I have a 9am. That day if you want to do it."
11614.0,Patient,yeah let's let's stick with that.
416.0,Provider,October 21 at 9am 1021 I am and then let me go to two weeks from that would be. The force. How early of a riser are you.
11614.0,Patient,"i'm. As needed, you know i've been a consultant for so long that I kind of wake up when I want to wake up and I do stay up late typically but."
416.0,Provider,"Are you not your are you you're not an early morning person. i'm not asking, because I have early morning appointments I have like six and 645."
11614.0,Patient,Oh yeah that'd be too early for me okay.
416.0,Provider,that's fine that's fine some people love those they're like what i'm wide awake at that time that's perfect.
11614.0,Patient,yeah I went to about eight o'clock every day. Just started naturally so yeah prefer not to disrupt that.
416.0,Provider,No problem okay so then let's do the fourth at 9am again.
11614.0,Patient,Great.
416.0,Provider,Okay. alrighty so and then on the fourth will schedule out beyond that.
11614.0,Patient,"Okay, good every one of the question i'm if you can help me with this or not, but i'm also trying to find a therapist for couples therapy. And I think, be great if that person also has some you know some more knowledge in the area of addiction. Is that something I should try to pursue through bright heart or just generally through my insurance company their mental health network because i'm finding a lot of people aren't taking new patients now so it's really refine. It is hard."
416.0,Provider,And I don't know of any couples therapist separate heart.
11614.0,Patient,Okay.
416.0,Provider,"it's not really what we do. Okay, or at least not yet we're. Right hearts always growing and changing. So maybe at some point we will but yeah right now I don't think there's any plans for that that I know of and yeah I would maybe check with your insurance and see if there's. See if there's any options I it sounds like you've explored some of that."
11614.0,Patient,yeah they found bright heart and also the Inpatient program and yeah.
416.0,Provider,yeah have you. read them for couples yet.
11614.0,Patient,With that.
416.0,Provider,Have you talked to them about couples therapy yet.
11614.0,Patient,"They you know I haven't made that my top priority, yet, but I will now kind of push that one well because I really kind of have to be proactive on that and then push them to actually find somebody for me."
416.0,Provider,What about your if your insurance isn't where do you and your fiance have the same insurance.
11614.0,Patient,"No, she has she has different insurance right."
416.0,Provider,"So if it doesn't work through yours, maybe it could work through harsh."
11614.0,Patient,"Right yeah I was referring to use mine, because my co pays a lot lower but. she's got a PPO and want an hmo but."
416.0,Provider,yeah.
11614.0,Patient,"But yeah you're right, we might need to do that. Because there's a much wider range of therapists. To see under her planted."
416.0,Provider,"yeah there's also some therapists that only accept private pay. folks in private practice, but what they will do is provide you with a super bill that you can bill your insurance, so you wouldn't get the full reimbursement, it would be considered like out of network or whatever. But you could explore that as an option to if you had to go if you can find anything else, and you really found a. Private therapist that you guys felt really connected to. And then just get reimbursed for it."
11614.0,Patient,Good.
416.0,Provider,"Okay, all right ronald's well and it's been lovely meeting you. i'm excited to work with you it'll be really fun."
11614.0,Patient,i'm i'm really happy yeah I feel like I can feel like it's a good fit already yeah.
416.0,Provider,"me too, it seems like our you know my style and your goals align Nice."
11614.0,Patient,"Yes, okay."
416.0,Provider,"um so that's great i'm excited, and so I will see you tomorrow in the morning and then i'll introduce you to everybody and then i'll see you again on the 21st."
11614.0,Patient,that's great.
