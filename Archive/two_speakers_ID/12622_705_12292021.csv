705.0,Provider,How are you Robert.
12622.0,Patient,Okay let's see.
705.0,Provider,yeah area. That I can hear ya I can see you.
12622.0,Patient,"yeah okay Good morning, how are you."
705.0,Provider,"Good morning i'm doing well, thank you how about yourself."
12622.0,Patient,"i'm good tired, we got back to work, finally, on was a Sunday actually didn't think that I was scheduled, but I was on the schedule, I guess, for 10 and 10 in the morning. That it caused me to die today ended up staying there for died to 920 ish so after like three weeks of work, I ended up coming back like almost a 12 hour shift that I started by afternoon swing shift whatever you would call it five to 130 on Monday, and I did that again. With today's Wednesday yeah yeah I did that again Tuesday I lost track of days I. have something. I bore out i'm tired and then I got my booster to after everything cleared up the day that I went back, so I think everything kind of added together you're spending it drained me i'm just pushing through."
705.0,Provider,"wow and what emotional drain to to go through that with your entire family when I saw you last you were taking care of the baby, and I think the five year old. Who is with her mom and then was it the seven year old didn't have it."
12622.0,Patient,"yeah it was a me the baby and the seven year old girl we're cooped up in the living room and then. We ended up getting tested the week because in one week manner, with all the way to test and native that we tested, I believe the week after. And that was because I started losing taste and smell, I noticed that everything was kind of dope and saying okay well you know, let me get tested. tested tested positive so that's what we kind of flip flopped she was only on her ninth day I take a quarantine but she was farther out. And more likely to be less contagious and me, because I was just tested positive, so we ended up switching and I like myself in the room for a weekend, it was held fit. That said, I don't like that whole being I mean it's one thing to be a loner like I like to be by myself, I, like my privacy, but what i'm forced to do it. it's a whole different story so that that for me really brought back a lot of the anxiety and depression of those feelings again just because I was stuck in there, with nothing but time."
705.0,Provider,wow.
12622.0,Patient,"They fill it all that crap is over, God forbid, we get it again I don't want to deal with that, I mean, I noticed they, for some reason I really find it stupid as like honestly, but with everything the. way that it's basically exploded with that new variant or whatever, and then I don't know where they mentioned that okay what's new records, but then. CDC is going to say let's cut the quarantine time down to seven days, and then they cut it down to five days and it's just like you guys are stupid like it doesn't that don't make sense, like it's. Even if it's not as serious or it does not as doesn't have as many complications as the other whatever strange viruses. It Why would you it's going off to her going crazy, why would you lower the quarantine time I mean I don't I highly doubt that just because it's a different strain it's going to be less catchy after five days and the other one so. It just kind of pushes my trust more further I mean I don't really trust the government or any of that crap it always but it just kind of verifies that helps kind of keep me on the side that i'm adding it just it doesn't make sense to me but. It is what it is."
705.0,Provider,"I know I read to this morning, Robert where they're talking about that, and there were saying that they did the five days, because people weren't quarantining the full time, so they thought five days, people could tolerate. But again, where you said, the lack of trust, then it's like Okay, you say this, but now you're saying this."
12622.0,Patient,"I mean, I gave up well once it's all this stuff like i'm not. I see a lot of people with the pudding pudding the politic pushing the politics and all that stuff with this and say that, just to give a. And all that stuff I don't think all that, like it's not a gimmick it's a real thing, but I just think it's more like a flu, but as far as the recommendations that are given out It just seems seems like they're pulling out of there but, honestly with everything where i'm just. Like everybody else I think we're just tired of this crap we just push through and get through it, I just hope it doesn't keep. going on and on, as bad as it is, I mean I know it's never gonna go away it's going to be, just like the flu it's going to be a yearly shot and all that I can already predict that but, as far as a quarantining and shutting down and cities and all that stuff. is too much, I mean I know just from my week alone and seeing how my feelings, I mean being that I did I mean that I do have the past with anxiety and depression stuff I mean it's kind of expected and. sucks, but it was kind of expected, but I did see and feel what I believe majority of the people that are having to do this felt and it's the different kinds of anxiety and depression and and the normal that i'm used to so I mean I can imagine, like the mental. The mental crisis that's coming from this woman, especially with the kids like quarantine the kids the five year old like she was going crazy like I felt bad she'd come out, I told you last i've come out and she'd be crying and he just wanted to be held and. just wanted to be live it's like God, but I can imagine me America is already going through a whole mental crisis with the. Politics and all the other stuff going on this just added to it, like, I feel bad for people like I know I have my issues and stuff and. I also realized that there's people that are much worse than me, and this is this kind of stuff like this can push people over the edge, I mean thankfully i'm not one of those people, but I can see how we do it, I just hope that something gets done to help those people because it's an."
705.0,Provider,"Absolutely was there also to you know, Robert you probably have some of the coping skills that other people don't have because you've been in group you've been you know and therapy was there anything that you were able to pull from to help manage day by day when you're isolating."
12622.0,Patient,"yeah well initially I was just kind of lost in translation, but I did reach out to the my emails that you had sent me with those techniques, I did experiment, a little with those But my main thing for me was really the breathing and actually. symptom wise like only thing I really had was the smell I smell and taste, but I was extremely tired body wise So when I did, like the breathing breathing was like my main thing that would basically shut my mind off. Now, when I do that majority of the time I would end up passing out like I didn't fall asleep. And I didn't wake up like before when when I wasn't working towards the end of my workers come I disability stuff had mentioned before, that I would sleep like that was my. Basically, my get away from the depression or just force myself sleep, and I would sleep for three four hours in the middle of the day, but I wake up feeling like shit like I wake up feeling worse than I did when I fell asleep, like everything just kind of piled in and just. overflowed Mike up. This, in this case it didn't and i'm not sure if that's because the virus about your that's because the breathing i'm not sure like just the mindset that I had going into that fleet. But I was thankful that that didn't happen, because that would have just pushed me closer to the edge with that because it was pretty bad, but the breathing for me, I mean the breathing seems like the. breathing seems like the main thing for me as far as stress relief that anxiety like to keep my mind that in any kind of like movement exercise, I mean we talked about like cleaning the House or even just being at work like just basically keeping active. Those are like my things a lot of the other things that i've tried yeah I mean it there, they usually help like temporarily but it's like so insignificant like so so temporary that sometimes. I do try it but i'll end up avoiding it after a few times that I just feel like it's failed. To get it all just experimentation."
705.0,Provider,"know, but you did really well Robert we're in one of your toughest times you did what you knew with the breathing techniques and that's your go to and it worked to get you through that. yeah now I mean it is when you take control over your breathing and not allow yourself to just come now, more than you could sleep in your body needed sleep to recover."
12622.0,Patient,"yeah and I think to with the breathing I noticed excited I got a little one of those smart watches for myself for Christmas at a. It actually gave a time because it has like the heart rate and the stress detector and all that stuff and they may not be 100% accurate, but they do give a like a good good record like heart rate and stuff. And I played around a few times with the like, with the ot levels of the heart heart rate and I noticed a lot, like my heart rate. When I get those feeling my heart rate is always elevated it's always higher, of course, I guess, because, like anxiety and stuff. I did notice like a breathing like that's a real good way to control that like your blood pressure, your hardware like you really control it with a breathing it slows it down. Big time like I seen one day it was up at like 115 115 bpm and after the breathing maybe five to 10 minutes after hours down it's like 85. Like dropped significantly and I felt better and it makes sense, I mean i'm not pushing so much blood, like the top speed through my brain and through my body so. it's yeah it's helpful I do like that."
705.0,Provider,"It is and on your watch to mine isn't an apple mine's just an off ramp but I love to that the steps, and then the reminders to like stand up drink water, I mean sometimes it's nice to have our reminders."
12622.0,Patient,"yeah that's what the two that i've actually got a try again I tried it before I was doing good with like the water edgy match to the wire wire, is what the that I know that for sure if I. If I drank the water, I was supposed to release immediate half of the ones that I was supposed to I would feel a lot better because I, my old job when I was working at the desk i'd have. A man I go through probably maybe two gallons a day like caused it up or down to the bathroom, of course, which was irritating but. What I drink all that water everything's all better the headaches, of course, wouldn't be there, I mean mood even all that stuff so I want to get back to. Like, even if I have to set a reminder every hour to chug a water bottle of water, whatever I want to get back to that because I know I haven't been I know I probably been dehydrated probably for the last year, my life. That Andre guy I just started I don't know why he's not really my thing I mean. It just to play with it's funny because I can drink carbonated water like just playing flavorless carbonated water I love it I could drink that all the time, but as far as just regular still water and so don't I just don't care. But I gotta get back good. For my health."
705.0,Provider,And there's so many different types to like can't have you tried the hint water.
12622.0,Patient,"That I have I don't care, the only like as far as the waters with the flavoring I only care for like some of the sparkling wines, as far as like the skill water with flavors it's disgusting to me, for some reason. The one thing that I do want to try, that I know a lot of people like with a lot of those natural people that don't believe in medicine they believe it like alkaline diet, I do want to try. Sex so expensive, but when I get financially better again out of the hole I do want to try getting a. For as far as water wise getting cases of the alkaline water and just experimenting with that and drinking that and seeing how that goes, because I heard. And i've seen a lot of things that i've read like online and stuff of how the alkaline diet and just even just alkaline water helps with the healing of the body and everything. So I do want to experiment with that I feel like, if I could feel benefits from regular stillwater if I could feel even more benefits of alkaline water, maybe that'll be like hey okay drink it. drink it exactly and while you're waiting for that you know with the alkaline water is like you said, setting the reminder on your watch."
705.0,Provider,"Because I said, you can send it like daily or hourly you know how many, what do you think, then, is something that you would more than likely pay attention to a drink water."
12622.0,Patient,"Honestly, at first, it would have to probably be like hourly or every two hours, just because, if I said it for what for daily or whatever i'll look at it and. I might drink it that first time when I do see it when it pops up but that's gonna, be it if I have something annoying me being you're vibrating on my wrist and I look, and I see it, that would be. That would push me more towards doing it than just that, once a day thing i'm actually going to get that setup and. qb get that all set up and then experiment with that, to see how far I could take it that's one thing I it's hard for me to. Stay committed to stuff like that i've noticed like i'll get on a group, like even an exercise i'll get on a group for like a week or two, but it ends up kind of. Whatever excuses I managed to find end up pulling me away from that whole routine and exercise that that's what the I know for sure, makes me feel wonderful like I enjoy the pain. Well yeah the pain, I guess, you could say the soreness from actually doing it like knowing that you've done something. And just the fact that it takes all that extra energy out of my mind, and that also helps with the anxiety and stuff. It just the whole commandment part of it's hard to stay committed to it i'm not sure what the issue of that is right now, but I just want the I do got to work out to and see if I can get some kind of. routine good routine going on and that might actually be something with the alarm to it just now I gotta get used to this whole schedule, so I got to kind of. Get back on track with this old middle of the night day type work schedule and then, when the kids go back to schools, I just kind of got to prepare myself to get ready for. Probably about a month of a extreme tiredness. And wow yeah exactly."
705.0,Provider,"yeah, and that makes sense, Robert then priority wise is getting you sin adjusting to the schedule. And then it's kind of a almost like a goal, and when the kids get back into school it's probably easier than to I think before did you go and you would walk to pick them up and walk them back."
12622.0,Patient,"know their school we actually put them in a school that was a kind of, on the other side of town, it was a charter school a lot better than the area, the schools there, an area where in and better than the public that city schools that are around here. So we can't really walk, but I would walk I would park at the school that I would walk around the block a couple times when meaning when the fiber wasn't in kindergarten. We would go and do the walk walk to the park and and walk around the block or whatever that's that's up there that they really helped were to be able to do it now, because I won't be picking them up from school i'll be dropping them off in the morning. But I just have to, I have to find a way to get myself out and do it and, hopefully, later on, once the baby's a little older and as a shot and it warms up a little bit it'll be easier I just throw them in the stroller maybe go around the block or something. yeah at the end during the days."
705.0,Provider,"yeah absolutely and like you said experimenting with your watch and seeing what sticks because maybe with the lodge. You get in the habit of Okay, the reminder and I don't ignore I do what it's saying and then start to add on the water and then maybe the steps of exercise and then from there yeah so the baby to everybody's recovered the baby didn't end up getting coed."
12622.0,Patient,"I i've heard a few people that have babies that are really young that said that actually did get tested and they said that the babies tested positive but they had the same situation as our baby. It was like a fear for one day and then other than that it was it, so I think he did have it, I really. doubt, I still don't understand how the seven year old didn't get it, but I really doubt being in a House completely crammed full of a bunch of people with coven pretty sure he had it I just think that it didn't affect him as much as it. I mean it really didn't affect me that much either mainly her and her side and her son his main thing was a strep throat, but I think he got it I just think he didn't it didn't hit him as hard as far as that everybody else's recovered, I mean my smell and taste there. Are there still it still sucks cuz i'm not really able to smell or taste anything yet, but they are slowly, had I coming back to me. So, other than that, I mean we're all good i'm actually going to go it's been man, a month, maybe since i've had a haircut so i'm going to go today I got that scheduled get my haircut and. Just kind of get back to the. normal daily life and. The kids will be back in school in two weeks so that'll be. A little less stress, because the House will be hectic and they won't have the girls sitting there fighting and having to make sure the boy does his chores and all that. it's ready for back to the routine life get everything back to someone normal."
705.0,Provider,"yeah oh that's good to today that you get to get away and just have some self care where you're going to get your hair cut and just. getting ready and then you're back at work, I know you were concerned, because you just started, you know the job and got back out there and it seems like the company again it's been very supportive."
12622.0,Patient,"yeah they're they're supportive, I do have a there is a little anxiety and stress with that as well, because I mean all the time I missed in the Eighth, to think I went back. What date was the 26 so from eight to 26 almost what 20 days almost 18 days. And that was all by I mean that was all training time, technically, I was scheduled initially for day shift just so I can be there with the senior technicians and they can train you on how they do things. And that kind of screwed that up, so what I got back I kind of got thrown thrown in the deep end. And they of course expect a lot being that i'm and I, like the known guy now because i'm the first technician they have working past 10 o'clock and years. So everybody knows me now and I don't know if it's like envy jealousy or whatever, but it seems like it, but now they they expect me to basically be proactive and they have everything. That they need set up, so they can have an easier job in the morning, which I understand, but I don't have all the training, so one thing that I work with and there's one person, one of the ladies that she's really. she's really like just flat out route she's one of those older Asian lady that just kind of she gives off that impression that she's super entitled and add time she comes off as be. And i'm not going to notice that i've actually mentioned to the other co workers, the way that she talks and they said yeah that's just how she is. But she's one of the one that been complaining, because she basically wants everything done. Everything that she wants, then basically all certain things to get prepared for the morning, which is quite a bit and last night. I really learned, because the first night, it was stressful because i've never actually filled the drugs in in their pharmacy i've never done a lot of stuff that I did that I haven't done. I ended up breaking the label printer somehow and I came back to that so that was like anxiety thing she came called me over she was super nice when she had mentioned it. that'd be I don't know it was kind of weird but that that added to it, but the last night came in and I really like it was. They stay she she her her specifically said that it's not busy. bs she doesn't know because she doesn't work it so that's up there, she does try to mention something today about anything that didn't get there i'm going to have to pull her aside and talk to her about because she could talk to the pharmacist and she can see exactly. What i've been doing the last night was super busy as far as filling and helping with the pharmacist what he wanted that and. Technically she's not my boss she's just a technician he is the boss any pharmacists that's Our duty is technically our boss so. What they say trump's what the technician say I don't care what that technician said that the pharmacies told me one thing i'm going to do that before i'm going to do what she says. So I just need them to understand that, because i'm not gonna i'm not the type to bite my tongue and if if i'm going to get shit every morning when I come in from her specifically. In the in the tone that she's been then we're going to have to have a sit down with the boss because that's not going to flow because I will end up snapping honor and i'll probably end up losing my job and I don't want to do that. Just because of the fact that I don't like when people talk now I mean you got to give respect to get. Respect so we're going to see how kind of see how that goes today we'll find out, but everything I I feel like everything went smoothly So hopefully there's not an issue. But I do have that little bit of anxiety, there are likely everybody that works there understands the way she is and. There are some other technicians there that are real helpful and real kind, which is one of the reasons why I have. Like it's easier for me to go in, I mean if it was any other place and I had that I didn't have. Other co workers that were cool and Nice to me, then it would be one of those jobs where I would not want to go to like it'd be one of those wake up and just want to go I can't wait to go home that kind of place, but so far those technicians kind of keep me grounded from that negativity. just got to take it as it goes, but I feel like i'm doing good i've learned a lot i've learned and I know for a fact that I learned a lot faster than majority of the people, even though my experience isn't in retail but i've picked up a lot real fast and. My confidence is growing with that too, because the fact is i'm able. To see that i'm picking stuff up a lot faster than I expected and they they expected. So just kind of taking it as it goes, I don't want to be here forever, I mean the retail it's fun, for the time being, but it is very tiring so really. My plan with this is probably get a sticker out may want to do a minimum six months, of course, but that's only if I could find something that's better. A long time like hospital or something other than that, I would say, probably stick around for maybe a year me tough it out, if it is. Not as decent as a I would hope, it would be and then just kind of do like I did again just kind of bust my butt to find it, because then i'll have. Either the i'll have the experience there to put on the resume of being in a pharmacy rather than my last pharmacy job, five years ago. And if i'm actually working in a pharmacy I know kind of weird, but when you apply for a job, like a job with the same field, and they see that you're actually working for them it's like okay well. he's already alone, let me let's let's say like competition basically like oh yeah he's he's working for them okay we're gonna take him in. let's offer him $2 more than what he's making there and let's make sure that we get a so gotta kind of use that for my advantage to. But for now, it works and i'm learning a lot of stuff that I didn't know before and then refreshing on a lot of stuff that I didn't know that the kind of wiped out over those five years."
705.0,Provider,"And you know rubber you're really out there before I know you've been out out of the career for a bit. And now to come back and adjust and then i'm hearing, even with this one person that maybe there's been some some friction is that you're going to pull her to the side and have that conversation be assertive. To respect her and to respect yourself. To make it work."
12622.0,Patient,"yeah I mean I gotta respect that's one thing I have learned in life, I mean what goes. yeah those people at those at AC every job you have those people that are there they're veterans like they've been there for a while they start to get more lacks they start to hold their nose up little higher because they know. Like I say everything but they think they feel like they know everything I mean that that's kind of Everywhere you go, so I learn to deal with those. types of people, especially in pharmacy mean we get a lot of those I don't know I mean I don't know of race has to do it, too, but i've noticed like. Agents Pacific islander so Filipinos especially they seem to be that more. I would you say, the more I mean they're very straight up people which that I do respect, but they also seem like they have that more cockiness that know it all and it's to them. So I kind of adjusted with that back way back when I first started my job so it's been a little easier to deal with her thankfully. smooth out though I know well, because I know how hard I work, and I know I know for sure last night the pharmacist i've been working with like he. He noticed how hard I work and you notice what I do so eventually they'll see and there'll be able to hear from the pharmacist and i'll end up okay just a matter of spending that extra time and getting in there and just letting them get used to me and get to know me."
705.0,Provider,"And it is to this sometimes with different cultures, they have a different way of conversation. Like I know, sometimes when i'm in other countries, they say, with Americans that we kind of talk around it, that a lot of times we're so nicely nicely when they just want to get it done because they're in a hurry we perceive it as they're being you know. aggressive. They see it as maybe an eager or rude and so it's funny How, then, for when we're maybe traveling international to have how they take Americans as being overly friendly. And extract from that sometimes that we're not as assertive."
12622.0,Patient,"um that's one thing to that i've noticed that's that's actually one of my dreams, I mean it's not too late, I just i'm gonna have to wait later in life, now, but I do want to travel. Internationally, because I do want to experience how other people live life like that's for YouTube if you call my YouTube that's based like cooking vices another one that I like, but a lot of it's like those people that their travel bloggers like they."
705.0,Provider,Go.
12622.0,Patient,"One of them is like he he loves Russia he travels all around Russia, and then we got another one that goes basically everywhere. And that's one thing that I do want to do just because I mean life is different Americans are we're a melting pot of a bunch of different people and we don't really get to experience what it's like other places. And it's interesting because, just like you said, I mean depending on how they're brought up people that are around I mean it's what's rude to us, maybe normal to them and that's another thing, like my first job. was at circuit city, and it was in fremont and i'm not sure I don't know if you're familiar with demographics in fremont but it's the majority Indians. yeah majority Indians and they're the way what I was told to buy an actual Indian that I worked with was being that out in India, just so crowded so jam packed like the manners they don't have them what we call manners here they push they don't say, excuse me. And like before like I there was a couple times that that job that I almost got into it, with people because of the fact that they were so rude they talk down to you, basically, the way I felt and. Just gotta learn that, I mean they're not from out it's that they're raised different based on their cut from a different tree, so you gotta learn how to kind of. brush it off, basically, I mean you could still be assertive to an extent when it gets too far, but you still got to kind of realize that they're not they're not you basically."
705.0,Provider,"yeah and that understanding, because a lot of times to that you were talking about the pushing. it's been told to me that you know in our culture, we have to push forward if you want to order something from the market, because if you stand in line like you do here that's not going to happen."
12622.0,Patient,"And again, nothing."
705.0,Provider,"Right right so out of necessity, then that's what you learn, and when you under for me, I know, once I understood that, then I was like I was in Thailand and the more that they push then you're like okay. Wait a minute, this is what's happening, this is just part of it, then you have different where, if you feel like they're doing it at you like purposely it's like it's America and we're like wait a minute. yeah yeah but it's that whole understanding and just you know different personalities, different cultures. You have, as you know, when you go back to work, you realize that every day, especially here we're in a melting pot, which I think this is great, I think it also to have some opportunities, where. We learn from one another and sometimes it may have seen one way, and then you had the experience, where you sit down and talk to someone that was Indian and he was able to share with you give you some insight. yeah yeah."
12622.0,Patient,"For sure it's I mean the melting pot thing is cool I mean I enjoy I enjoy the whole diversity there that's what the I can't well, I mean where i'm at my desk so now, I mean it's basically like. it's kind of like San Jose of the valley, so there is quite a bit of diversity, and so, especially now with all the transplants. But I do miss the bay area for the fact that it was. Like there, there was I just like it was a lot more diverse we had so many people and. So many different restaurant, I mean for me the food honestly pet so many different kinds of restaurants that foods and. You just kind of get interact with a bunch of different people that that's what I really miss like I enjoy that whole mixture, because I don't I. don't know if i'm bored with being out here in the United States, or if it's just like my passion is just like to go out there and travel and I think that might be part of it, because i've always wanted to travel and I kind of. like to say screwed it up, but. I just kind of lag on it like I could, if I would have did they could have should have whether basically I got a high school if I would have went to college and I could have been to a college or across the United States and that I could have did some kind of. program like a change program or I could have got into a field or get like a peace, the Peace Corps or something to get that traveling out there, even the military. Military was actually something that I thought of when back when my dad first passed away and my brother has been military since before he was 18 he was recruiting at as high school. And he Of course he pushes it he drives a push it which benefit wise is awesome. I mean seeing him and my sister in law and they got eight kids and they're able to push through and live a nice life by House and all that. benefit wiser chat like it's totally worth the travel wise, in my opinion, it would be totally worth it, because you're good I mean you could get stationed anywhere. You could get a chance to experience a life but you're not stuck permanently there and you're not paying for a $3,000 vacation to Thailand or India, or whatever. But it never went through that I mean life kind of game, so now for me it's just more of a. I guess you could say a goal, a goal for like retirement, so I was telling my fiance and we get all that I would enjoy buying I mean if we. Hopefully, by that time we're able to actually buy a house and have something to sit on. But if that's the case, then I told her what we could just get either refinance house or make payments get rv and just. Travel the country, I mean Dr road trip just kind of for retirement, I have to worry, I mean. Travel and then, if we do have a house we own we can rent it out that could be the income passive income for us, plus whatever retirement funds are so security now I can be associated by then I can already predict. But."
705.0,Provider,"Robert. it's a good, safe now for retirement. yeah like okay this isn't going to be around i'm going to do that can now. i'll go to work. I need to to save in the bank."
12622.0,Patient,"yeah definitely yeah so security i've been I mean when I was young, my dad would always talk about stuff that you already talked to kids about, but that was one of the things he said to you know avoid when you're older. What we do, social security, you get when you retire it's not going to be there. And that's kind of stuff that held on that I know I when I see checks and stuff my paycheck etc and social security tax law that's that's okay they're taking money out and gamma give me my 300 bucks back like it's a lot of money. And then thinking about that, like it's not gonna be around like okay so i'm basically paying for everybody else, but it is what it is, but now, with the coronavirus and all these. How would you call like the bailouts are. All these all this free money that they're basically giving away and being that we're already trillions in debt. I mean they're giving out trillions in the last couple years like it's been a couple trillion dollar that they mentioned they gave us. pray again that money for later they got to be second that money out of somewhere and. I have a feeling that's what it's going to end up being those basically that social security and stuff that a lot of these people that are like they need it, which is sad but. I mean it is what it is that, just like you said it's just more motivation to realize that hey you need to either get your 401k said i'll get something set up, so you have some kind of security, if not. I mean I don't want to be, I would like to retire by 60 if that's possible I know that's like dream status, these days, but uh I know it's not impossible, I actually have to close to family, friends, both. The mom and the dad they stay with started working there 1618 but they stuck there with their companies one was a carp. A floor guy and one was work for state state funded insurance and both of them were able, I think, maybe I think the dad retired at 50. know about this yeah they're both about the same the mom she's about to retire next year I think she said, but the dad retired, a few years back around like 5556 and they had all that time invested in there that they're retiring with full pay. So that that's something that I want, I want to find that company, where I can do that, I mean I know it's a little later in life right now it's i'm already 30 years old, but with the right company, I could push 20 years. With that company, and I could still pull that off, so it is it's a possibility for me and that that gives me. A little more hope because i'm not good, I mean I could I could save but. For some reason, every time I get that savings built up like even with my first job was stuff something would kind of hit, and I would need to use it for one reason or another. So it's hard for me to be confident in my own capability of saving, but as far as like. Set account or 401k something like that or just the whole 20 years bested at a job, like, I feel like I could confidently retire out of something from that realm. Man, if I can get my own business that'd be awesome I love food, I mean. that's one thing I think about I mean nobody wants to have a boss everybody would love to be their own boss, and for me when I think about that. For some reason it's always food, food, food, something POPs in my head food, food, food business restaurant food truck food cart something like that, so I may end up getting that. I would you say that that a me I always have the passion passions are there, but I may end up. Having that that one day I might just get that kind of kicking the butt to be like hey let's stop doing this let's focus on this let's get that data may actually like venture out. Try it because I know I get compliments for cooking and all that kind of stuff and just my passion for the food itself and, if I can find a way to kind of intertwine that into jobs. And a card or whatever that may be something that I can be successful. And I do, I do have confidence with the with the whole cooking and stuff and I know. You mean if you do what you love you're not working like they say, and that would be something I understand with food like with. Even with the card or a food truck it's probably going to be. A lot of work, I mean it's not going to be an eight hour shift, I mean it's probably going to be a 24 hour shift basically preparation and shopping and all that stuff but. If you're doing something that you like, I mean, even if it is a constant working 24 hours, I mean you're. not looking at it like it's not gonna stress you out like it's worth because you're doing something you like, and then in the end, you can turn a look and say i'm the boss like I don't have him telling me. blah blah blah I don't have her looking down on me or have to worry about if I don't show up to work or, if I have to call in sick or if I want to take a vacation. So i'm kind of a kind of have that target kind of it's kind of foggy to the side, but that target has kind of been there always and I think subconsciously that's where my mind is like pushing me now. Hello now right. Oh hmm and that's actually something to that I would be able to do even. I mean if I were to do like part time weekend work or whatever, take a lot of time, but it would be a good start, but that'd be something that I could do, even after retirement if I wanted to, especially if, like, I was able to do good and actually get a truck or a car or a trailer. And that would be something i'd be able to do and even like just traveling to like with the trailer like you can put that baby up to an rv and kind of go down the coast and park it and. pop it open and get whatever shows you need and move on to the next place and with the whole food truck scene nowadays and. The way everything's going food wise and people not going to dine in restaurants, I feel like that's just going to get to get a busier and busier over time, people are going to start, and people are already starting to avoid indoor stuff. So I feel like there, there is a good chance that that will work out for me one day it's just a matter of getting back. Getting back to the to the whole workflow I just kind of pause pause everything with the whole disability thing which I do slap myself. For every once in a while how cuz it's like five years that would have been five years of working five years of saving as much as I may not have like that other job it was great money and I didn't have a 401k and all that. But there's no looking I mean there's no regrets you can't regret that I mean everything happens for a reason I live my life. regretting a lot of things and also did was turn me into that depressed anxious person that I was like to say that I am because i've pulled away from a lot of it, compared to what I was honestly like a year year and a half ago."
705.0,Provider,"Today, though, Robert you are building that financial backing where then you'll have the means that if that is what you want to do long term and those five years to that you spent. I remember you telling me about that a lot of that was dedicated to the kiddos and so that amount of time and making those memories can be priceless and so you were able to step in and be there when they were most needed it."
12622.0,Patient,"yeah that's definitely true that's the the good the light the light through the clouds on that whole. Actually, that whole five years honestly that was good, I mean just the towards the end with the finances when everything kind of started cutting down cutting off completely that's when. All the anxiety and everything kind of built up, which is to me it's understandable because I mean as an adult you have to be able to pay your bills you can't money can't buy happiness, but if you don't have money you're not going to be happy because you can't handle your business. So, but yeah that that is definitely a positive for that whole period of life as much as I know that it was a Pis their psyche said, I mean all the money in the world can't buy that dads that are out there that don't see their kid there don't spend time with their kids I. mean the kids and the parents they're mostly missing out on a lot that was able to experience a lot, a lot of parents don't and even the fact that the kids are not, I mean they're they're my kids regardless, but the fact that they're not my blood, I mean that just to me that made it. I made it a little better, just because the fact like it was unexpected like it was. kind of a surprise, and it was like God God or Mother Nature whatever placed me in that situation for a reason to kind of build strength because prior to that I was kind of everywhere, I mean I was i'm legacy I wasn't. I was super like depressed or anything Prior to that, but my life was kind of just. How would you said just kind of like scattered everywhere, when, after my dad dad I kind of just lost direction to what what who, what, where when basically. And I just kind of did what I did and. work where I had to work out the jobs, I was never really struggling too much which surprising, who, with the stuff that my mom put me through after all that but. I ended up fighting that helped me find my path basically like it showed me that I do enjoy the kids I do want that I do want the whole dad life. And it just kind of it's been teaching me so currently how to balance that whole family I want a family, I want to take care of the kids I want to be the role model and teach them and then the whole financial career side still try to balance allow right but. it's helping me."
705.0,Provider,"yeah and you were able to build that foundation, because you were forming young minds young hearts. From the beginning, you know the five years to where you are now were you adjusting and being with work and being able to juggle that you already know you spent time you built that rapport you have that relationship."
12622.0,Patient,"yeah and it shows, to this day, especially with the new I can't say the baby now, but especially with the girl with the baby girl because we. met her super close like I could say that we're probably me and her have a tighter bond, and both her. biological parents, I mean even even her mom like she comes to me, and she was so excited when she was able to get off recording and then, when I was able to. I want to cut it with your data she just come live with me and I can see the little jealousy and stuff like when I hold the baby. But we just have a lot tighter bond, and I see with anybody else, like the boy the boy and his mom or the boy and his grandma I should say, like spoils the hell out of him so they're like super tight. And the middle the middle daughter she's she's. she's uh she's basically our hippie basically like she's our free spirit she's more we always joke around that she's more like. Basically, like my sister in law like she's she's into tie dye and she's just kind of chill she's very sensitive very observant very. Like she's just she's like a delicate flower basically does her her and her mom or a lot closer and then her energy and you. Know it's kind of funny the way people, the way we stick to certain people like magnets like certain people attract us together more like we bond better. But yeah it's helped me greatly being around these kids for sure, even with the drama that has been in there between. In between my fiance and her family and whatever other crap I mean, in the end those kids will pull everything through and put the shy that sent out through those clouds again yeah."
705.0,Provider,"yeah exactly and so today is a whole new day and it's like you've been the whole family's been through it and it's like you're at this. Other end of it now and it's like okay like you were talking about school, you were talking about you know you're getting your pattern down with working on, then you know, everybody else will kind of go into their routine now."
12622.0,Patient,"Getting. back to life back to reality, just like so."
705.0,Provider,"Yes, that's a good time."
12622.0,Patient,"yeah that's what David either even from a young age i've been around for so long, and my parents always listen to different. music from before my time, of course, so that's how that's always like after a vacation or carrier so that's, all I can play from I like back to life. Okay that's up that carries i'm like you said, I mean every day is a new day so regardless of what happened yesterday, how horrible yesterday could have been or how great it could have been. yeah I mean you woke up your eyes are open it's a new day it's time for a fresh start, I mean just got to look at it, like every day is a new. New fresh start basically a new adventure and just kind of live for that day and not do like I did for years and. Try and hope for the best future possible now you gotta just just get through the day, basically, I mean you could hope for the best and. expect the worst whatever to prepare yourself but don't think too far in the future, because when those things i've learned when those things don't come to it just kind of dig you into a hole that you don't want to be in. i'm still learning. But i'm getting it."
705.0,Provider,"yeah and that's what's important Robert is you're always you know learning and evolving like you said you're we're exploring what the coping skills and it's like. going through that tough struggle of you have an accordion team, you had some skills to go by, where it prepared you for that moment and it's the same thing with today you're more prepared. Because of some of those experiences that you went through and it's given you that ability, you know you have now the ability to to know what may work for you what feels right and what doesn't but you don't give up you're like you know what i'm going to try something else. yeah."
12622.0,Patient,Every time it goes we go through just makes us stronger at it.
705.0,Provider,"and being able to know that today you're doing the action steps like i'm hearing you have a really good long term, you know. goal of having a food truck tapping into something like that, for today you're doing financially building those blocks, you know higher up where you can pull from that, if you like. you're setting yourself up and your family."
12622.0,Patient,hey.
705.0,Provider,"Oh, I think that you're been successful at it you're you're back to work after the whole family basically had coven he pulled through that and here you are back to work 12 hour shifts and ready for more."
12622.0,Patient,"yep you're tired, but, and I know I can do it i've been there i've been i've been more tired than I am now living. Longer shifts I had a string more stressful job so. This is really taking."
705.0,Provider,"yeah and so anytime you know that, like today you're taking care of you know, some self care going to get your hair cut taking some time to to reset to really keep that balance that you have. Absolutely, I know, with with balancing and getting your schedule too did you want to set up Robert something on another Wednesday, or do you need to get your schedule."
12622.0,Patient,"At know, am I actually have a meeting yesterday I was supposed to take a picture of the updated schedule, but. From what the lady that we were speaking about earlier way to her little she had made a little comment about. My schedule and she had mentioned something oh you're not work so since you're not working weekend so i'm assuming that i'm going to have. Which is probably why they're jealous do that i'm going to have a set schedule it's what it's looking like Monday through Friday and it's going to be five to 130. So I could really schedule, I mean I could set stuff up for whatever now. I would, if we can go after today cuz when I woke up today I looked at the clock and I didn't really like I don't sleep in i'm usually up super early, but today I woke up at eight like 820 so I probably say we could set if we could do like a 10. Oh kind of hit 10 or 1030 that would probably be better for me."
705.0,Provider,"That would be great I have a January the 12th at 1030 available, would you be able to do that one it's on a Wednesday."
12622.0,Patient,yeah that should be fine.
705.0,Provider,"Okay, great i'll go ahead and put it in for 1030. And that is on the 12th of January."
12622.0,Patient,saved.
705.0,Provider,"And then. Should I look at, then the two weeks from there."
12622.0,Patient,"yeah we do that, like what the."
705.0,Provider,"let's see then 26 yes let's look at the 2626 two is open, did you want to do 1030 again, or we could even do it looks like a 10 o'clock."
12622.0,Patient,"yeah let's do 10 o'clock let's try let's try the 1030 for this next one, and then the 10 o'clock we'll see how those work, maybe i'll find. The 10 o'clock cuz I like early getting stuff done earlier on in the day I just don't want to do like today, and not wake up and they end up missing it."
705.0,Provider,"So, then, that will be on the 26 at 10 a."
12622.0,Patient,Week.
705.0,Provider,"So great so then Robert the appointments then on the schedule will be you know the next one will be on the 12th which is 1030 and then January 26 after that at 10 o'clock and then our groups on Friday will start back on the seventh of January, but. You go to. enchant tells group, she was sharing at 10 o'clock if you want it the same link did she already share with with Julie."
12622.0,Patient,"yeah she had mentioned that in the last that whenever the last meeting what it was that was because people were asking if there was any meetings on the day that she didn't say yeah it's gonna be the same link, which is with a different with different counselor."
705.0,Provider,"Right right and julie's fantastic, and so you know i've sat in on some of her well on the group when I first started, she was one of my trainers. So if you get a chance, and you know you want to meet new people, the group is open, you know Julie had shared that the group was wanting to meet new people, so if you get a chance. to attend that would be this Friday at 10 o'clock. Okay Okay, and as far as then, I know you talked about, maybe, setting as a goal drinking more water is there anything any other intentions you wanted to put out there for the next couple of weeks."
12622.0,Patient,"No, I mean. Other than that, I mean it's just basically a stain confident staying positive basically other than that, I mean really all it is right now I don't want to set too many a set too many goals up right now with the situation just trying to get used to life so. yeah those are good for now."
705.0,Provider,"i'd like your intention, though, Robert is to stay stay positive and so with with that I think it's always a great one and at least one time, a week, if it does affirmations work for you, or is it just looking at what reflecting back."
12622.0,Patient,yeah I mean I. To an extent yeah hey just kind of depends on the mood and I mean.
705.0,Provider,"it's always nice to you know throughout the week take a look, and just be able to be like you know what I did this. I was accessible and then it helps just booth set confidence. Where, then, if something does get more challenging you're able to already lean into what I did all of this, so i'm going to manage."
12622.0,Patient,"yeah maybe that that might be something I do subconsciously nowadays honestly, because when you when you say like that, when I think of positive affirmation or whatever, I mean I kind of don't. feel like I don't do it too much, but when a carrier coming from somebody I was like the way you just said it it's kind of something that I."
705.0,Provider,Do automatically.
12622.0,Patient,yeah exactly it's somewhat routine in my head.
705.0,Provider,"No and that's great, and that is where it is it's in your head, where it becomes more automatic where you're like Okay, I know what this is now i'm going to do a counter statement or I have some other skills. Well, good good good good well it's been great to see you Robert and then I will see you January, then the 12th at 1030."
12622.0,Patient,"Right, you have a happy New years."
705.0,Provider,You to see you in 2022.
12622.0,Patient,"yep see you next year, thank you."
