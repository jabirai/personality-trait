191.0,Provider,that people can tailor this your daughter right.
14009.0,Patient,"No so uh yeah i'm pretty sure if you could get past her apartment like which I don't think you should call the police, if anything."
191.0,Provider,"yeah yes, do you feel safe."
14009.0,Patient,"I do. Like I was just gonna. I have cameras on every entrance it's it's one of the reasons. I kind of decided to move there between her living there, and just I have a really awesome landlord and hey know the situation with her dad and everything, but he does keep trying to get Ahold of me. So."
191.0,Provider,"so well, he knows the treasure wants to lose it hmm. So, what are your plans with that he's going to keep trying he's gonna keep trying until he does, most likely, what are you gonna do."
14009.0,Patient,"Right now, I just keep ignoring him and hoping you don't show up but they told me to just now, I think I can refile because I didn't realize that if I didn't. become part of like the court case like I just thought they took over, and did it well, they dropped all charges, but she told me they could read file. And so they're encouraged me to do that."
191.0,Provider,rifai what a restraining order.
14009.0,Patient,"I think like well, I think, like the entire case I got a call her I haven't done that yet, because I had just gotten a message from her but um yeah I didn't know that I had like testify like there was, I thought the state took took over."
191.0,Provider,"So sounds like you were ready to be done with it. But it sounds like with him keep reaching out with you, you have to because my understanding, he was pretty abusive."
14009.0,Patient,Very abusive like basically I got a broken bone on someone.
191.0,Provider,"Okay, so what are you planning to do."
14009.0,Patient,"i'm like I said I mean I would, I would like to do is just pretend it doesn't exist move on."
191.0,Provider,But what I thought that's what I thought that's what you want to do.
14009.0,Patient,Do you think that is not he. yeah he's not really you know he keeps just turn act like nothing's wrong like hey like you don't tell me something about him so i'm just like.
191.0,Provider,"You know what that is right he's trying to appeal to your sympathetic, so that you can take him in so just so you know it would be very honest here, he will most likely not leave you alone and because if you speak to them, and you listen to him, he you given him hope. Okay Okay, and if you don't fight it it's gonna look like he's still got a chance. Now, if you go back in that situation with you and your small baby, what do you think will happen."
14009.0,Patient,"um I think he would hurt her, I really do."
191.0,Provider,"Okay, so what are you gonna do, what are you willing to do to protect yourself and your child."
14009.0,Patient,"i'm going to call the prosecutor and see what can be done, make sure there's still a team to make sure that didn't get dropped because that's what scares me if that's all you can just show up right, you know so i'm right."
191.0,Provider,"And you're thinking, the right way. Because right now that your baby she can't she can't defend herself she's relying on you. Right and you're relying on you and at some point in time it's okay to feel like you don't want to have any more broken bones, and you have a reason to live she needs you and you need you. it's going to take a lot of courage, one day, at a time for the time that you put in now to protect yourself and your baby if he does violate. Then you should at least have a law on your side, but you still have to take extra steps to protect yourself, now the doors and windows locked even putting the nail above the door not answering those calls not talking to one. Right anything like that."
14009.0,Patient,"So far, my a like I said he's trying to get Ahold my daughter she won't answer him he's trying to get Ahold of like different people meet late, nobody will answer him. I haven't answered him, but then he started having is one cousin try and get Ahold of like my sister, I mean it's just gotten out of hand. You know."
191.0,Provider,it'd be great if you could go somewhere where he wouldn't know where you were.
14009.0,Patient,I know.
191.0,Provider,"My concern is if he's calling, will he show up when he sent people to look for."
14009.0,Patient,"Things like. What honestly scares me, and I know this sounds crazy and I feel stupid even saying it, but it was like the one day I went to the store with my friend and we had the stupid little conversation about many close friends, because they were cute and they were on the shelf. Two days later, I get a text have many close friends with no text to it so i'm like can he get in my phone like."
191.0,Provider,If he has your if he has your phone number Kenny send you a text.
14009.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
191.0,Provider,So that's my concern that's my concern and that's why. You know I think with you get this weird thing about many clothes pins my concern is this if are you in a small town.
14009.0,Patient,"Yes, very small town."
191.0,Provider,"Okay, Dan. All right, did you tell your daughter about that text. yeah What did she say."
14009.0,Patient,she's like that's really weird because you know I wasn't at home when this was talked about this was. You were out and about and. We also don't think he's out smart.
191.0,Provider,"yeah but I mean yeah this is it's just amazing how if you know even not being a smart thing is he sounds like he's persistent, even if he's not that smart if he's persistent and he's clearly got a lot of anger."
14009.0,Patient,it's like he has no fear.
191.0,Provider,"that's what's best what is so unhealthy So my question to you i'm just thinking to you and your daughter talk about this. Is there a safe place where you can go even short term why you deal with all this legal this legal stuff where an even when you leave make a certain no one's telling you, or is there anywhere, you can go short term to be safe, is what i'm asking."
14009.0,Patient,"um I know my mom like you know my mom's got like a nine foot privacy fence my dad. owns a gun. that's like you know what I mean like there's no way he could even come near my parents, we live across the street from a cop. You know. They do. And it's like. But I know also know my mom like if I said I wanted an alarm and I want a deadbolt and all that stuff you know."
191.0,Provider,yeah so. Good sure up your environment. Okay it's just how can I want you to think safety. Because he.
14009.0,Patient,has no license so I know.
191.0,Provider,"He has no license, but do you think that'll keep them from getting where you need to go."
14009.0,Patient,"I guess, I was hoping, you know I can't picture him like driving without a license all the way to like because, like there's no way you can get into our town like it's so small, like they just sit and pulled him over and you come in, you know okay."
191.0,Provider,"yeah and if he has other people like if he, like you say if he use a cousin or friend, a call. Right and i'm just thinking not to cause any paranoia but heightened heightened, how do you. How do you make yourself more secure. i'm all in and then that tech should get and then having French trying to reach out to you."
14009.0,Patient,Right it's like eventually he's going I feel like he's going to show up.
191.0,Provider,"And if you're having that feeling respected is the baby his baby. Yes, okay so he's got a baby. yeah so that may be. Another attraction, you know something that he wants, you know."
14009.0,Patient,"But he'll text me and he'll say how's your baby and I said I don't understand it's like okay so you're trying to deny her, but like are we going to be like. yeah you can put whatever you."
191.0,Provider,"yeah I guess my concern definitely is the safety issue and the more we talk, the more concerned I am about safety for you okay. Please protect yourself that boat locks windows. watchful anybody knock at the door not letting them in."
14009.0,Patient,I know I really.
191.0,Provider,"Just be extra careful, because I know you hit share with us about what you had gone through, we hit not for guys."
14009.0,Patient,You know and it's like you know that's the thing like yeah he might be on camera but he's going to get to do something stupid before I get the COPs there you know.
191.0,Provider,yeah and it's just the even the thought of seeing him again.
14009.0,Patient,You know I mean there I can't remember a time that i've seen him that he hasn't hit me.
191.0,Provider,With us right and that's even more alarming yeah. yeah.
14009.0,Patient,"So it's like I know if he does show up he's gonna it's gonna be the first he's gonna and it's like he picks a fight out of know out of nothing out of nowhere like he just pulls them out of his ass and. there's nothing I can do it doesn't I can't talk myself out of it, I can threaten to call the police like there's just nothing I can do he's looking for that."
191.0,Provider,"But there's something you can do, I believe, to protect yourself, so it doesn't get there."
14009.0,Patient,yeah so I need to um yeah the prosecutor or victims assistance it was one of the to. Tell me.
191.0,Provider,"about what can you have in your possession, the pepper spray, be it tasers you know I don't know what else you can do so that something on your person and alarm that you can sound automatically summon the police."
14009.0,Patient,I was gonna say I do have a taser but okay what scares me is let's say I mean like is it going to put him down he's six foot tall 200 pounds yeah it doesn't is he going to kill me.
191.0,Provider,"Right and I know all those things come to my self Defense and i'm talking about self Defense enough to get away from him okay. You know what I mean basic blocks the punches that you can get away from him and how do you secure your environment to make it safe, so he doesn't come in and how do you secure your environment so when you're going out your House, are there blind spots that you need to be aware of. You know what I mean yeah and you know and having those codes or anything like that not answering your door if anybody comes and you don't know on. me, even if it's somebody say hey i'm here to check your plumbing i'm here to pay your landlord will call you in advance for something like that happens to me. You know so so try to be as prepared, as you can without being paranoid, because sometimes if we get paranoid and too fearful we can't think. So ray of free enough in your mind that you're thinking proactively on how to protect yourself. Right, I mean I mean even even if you find yourself, when you got to go grocery shopping, you have a pencil in your head, I mean any little thing keys in your hand if you got to go to your your door, and you know just what can you do to protect yourself to get away."
14009.0,Patient,"I got a. phone that had like this, when all you all you do is hit this one button and it calls 911 who like an I guess my daughter said, like iphones do that well I got a phone that does that and he did that and that did scare him for a while. Okay, you know, like he doesn't obviously like to deal with the police and I he never know if I I didn't have to call 911 then he couldn't take the phone and smash it I could hit a button he didn't know."
191.0,Provider,"The see that's good and, like some people have those alarms on on their button, the key chain. So you're walking around always having your alarm have your keys out, you know, whatever you, you know multiple things I can do the alarm fee it's alarms going off and he's still coming, how can I."
14009.0,Patient,run.
191.0,Provider,"You know how if I need to be up close, how do I kick what, what can I do so different layers when you're out what are you doing you're in your House, what do you do. If he gets passed the House and he's with you you've done a lot, what do you do just multiple layers how do I, you know always thinking that way, because there is a lot of women and people, men, they do defend themselves there's so many different options out there okay. you're not. You know, killing it and and but at the same token he's not able to kill the harm you too. Right yeah talk, talk to those people to what do they recommend to you know."
14009.0,Patient,"Well, I talked to social service that seems what everybody's concerned with actually is i've talked to social services, children services and everybody seems to be more concerned whether me and her safe than anything else and."
191.0,Provider,i've gotten the same feeling.
14009.0,Patient,"And so i've got, I guess, a lot of agencies right now helping which is really nice. But yeah like I just found out that they dropped the case. yeah. But that was my say they also said something about which I have to call back it's just right now, it seems like I have. everything happened at once."
191.0,Provider,"With with his history of extreme abuse towards you he's not gonna be locked up, unless you prosecute if you prosecute will he be locked out with all."
14009.0,Patient,"The State took over, and like. You know what I mean like I didn't have to be part of it and, at the time, like seriously they dropped the case right around the time I was having her I couldn't have been there, anyway. Right so but she left a message, and when I got it it said something about, but we can refile. He put the crab outfit honor."
191.0,Provider,"All right, well good all right i'm so happy to know that you're. Doing that Okay, and you have your mess until your next group right. Yes, okay so we've got that taken care of i'm just trying to look and make certain that we've got it i's and cross the t's."
14009.0,Patient,"One thing I wanted Okay, every time I go to do the A survey. The first page and hit next and it clears the whole form for me and I get to do it again it never gets past that first page."
191.0,Provider,Oh you're gonna have to ask the virtual clinic about that I have heard of people having a similar issue but I don't know what the fix was.
14009.0,Patient,"I didn't know, I was going to say if I tried it on my laptop if it would be any different if it was just a tribe."
191.0,Provider,"or during our group, if you want to talk with the care navigator because we often have a group and see what would they recommend. Okay, what what is the quick fix it sounds like a glitch and annoying when it that."
14009.0,Patient,And I applied just like a million times and every time it does the same thing.
191.0,Provider,"Oh, I hate when that when you get stuck in that limbo, with the computer and you can't get past a time and."
14009.0,Patient,I know and i'm like i'm trying so because they keep sending it to me too and i'm like but I.
191.0,Provider,"Know it's the most annoying thing so let's find out let's ask either a therapist. As some of the team members doing group ask a cure navigator either in the virtual clinical when you come to group, but I know there is a fixed we got to figure it out, I don't know, but something that was put our heads together to figure that out. All right, sorry I couldn't be more health. What are you doing about birth control."
14009.0,Patient,Right now abstinence.
191.0,Provider,Work control abstinence okay any change in your medicines.

14009.0,Patient,"um they had to cancel it I think when I switched pharmacies. and care navigator I think called and cancelled out anything I had it right, and so I got one, but I never got any the refills."
