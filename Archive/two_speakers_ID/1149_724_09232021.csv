Essentially, they tell you, without even telling you that they can work you like i've seen hours and there's not a whole lot you can do about it, but if you will, if you have to like call out for a day for sure you want you to use your sick time and."
1149.0,Patient,"there's no and try.

I screw off all day on Friday he's like So if you want your schedule will be like that he's like. he's like just hustle and he's like it's all doable there's nothing in here that you can't do over. You know and 2020 hours or is like a counseling gave us like he's like honestly, like the amount of work that's required easy there's no no excuse to not be able to get it done. And the time is up to you he's like but really you could probably get it done faster and he's like and then all the time is yours. And then I worked for another game that was salary and I was like yeah i'm going to be coming in late tomorrow, you know for like three hours ago a doctor's appointment and my boss like."

724.0,Provider,You know dig me now for that first sort of that you're gonna get out of me later down the road but it's it's salary so. yeah.
1149.0,Patient,"yeah and I think i've been. yeah here here i've also probably been i've been may be sick, I have a say in two years. To about two and a half years that i've been here, maybe going on almost almost three years that i've been here almost to a little over two and a half years I think i've been sick maybe. For four days. Total was like four days. Taken i'll take time off here and there, maybe on Christmas i'll take an extra day off and add it to our if if it along like weekend I like on Labor day or whatever I added an extra day, as you know. And it was like I go I even told my supervisor i'm just gonna i'm gonna use it calm time i'm going to take that extra day and just add it and take the four days off to nothing and I you're going to put an empty to so yeah it's that's the guy that's the kind of guy."
724.0,Provider,"yeah. So, on top of a horrendous commute every day, which is roughly three hours a day, you are, how many days a week, five."
1149.0,Patient,"Oh no. Now I. pretty much since i've. started, for the last for two years. I could you could say i've averaged six I average, six days a week, right now, it's been you know normally it's like five days and then it'll bump up to six. And then you know for a while and the big projects like when we had this ransomware all through Christmas new year's in like three months, it was seven days a week. Right now, for the last for like the last three months it's been seven days a week, other than when I had to go to my friend's funeral which I got and it was a weekend, it was like it was on Sunday and I got it I got bitched out for that. Well, you are you going to come into work afterwards. So. that's story that's that's the kind of job I got right now so."
724.0,Provider,"No, no. Are you looking for other options or."
1149.0,Patient,"That is that was that is my plan, it was my plan, and you know when. When yeah I had the other, the other counselors were kind of like working on that plan to try to get that moving keep moving that along. yeah, but when covert hit it that, just like."
724.0,Provider,stand still.
1149.0,Patient,"Not it was yeah that vaporized so. It was kind of like and now like I said it's the last the last me now it's kind of like it is, it is starting to pick up, however, the jobs that are out there, right now, or like. You know I did you know I i've i've turned down a couple gig but they're they're only like it close to my house so i'm trying to like get my finances kind of been getting them in order for the last year. I mean they're out right now they're paying 40 maybe 35 or $40 an hour and when you see that paycheck versus the paycheck I get now it's like APP really truly is yeah yeah."
724.0,Provider,"yeah but again you're if you factor in. commute time dry like. Last time wear and tear on the car and start. doing the math that way versus you know. A perfect world, you get a gig working from home, you know what I mean like in your field like that would be the perfect day."
1149.0,Patient,"Oh, and this job truly I mean it would not require me to be here every day, but when cove it hit I was like you could see this parking lot is this is like 16 buildings on this campus and this whole place was pretty much empty maybe 12 people here."
724.0,Provider,So so.
1149.0,Patient,"through all of code my boss said, you cannot work from home you're required to be there every day."
724.0,Provider,"Eventually, he worked from home."
1149.0,Patient,"Oh yes, he did I didn't see not one of them for for maybe six months before one of them popped in."
724.0,Provider,yeah. what's your what's your educational background like what.

1149.0,Patient,"I did I did I you know when I first got out, I mean literally I I had you know I had every I had CC CC empty CC and you know I did my. You know I did the you know boys network collaboration all kind of like I ran the gamut for a while, but. heck for the last 10 years it's you can't you got on I mean I know a few guys that can you know study to get those surgery certifications but the amount of time I spend in work, no way."
724.0,Provider,"yeah, and I mean would that would obviously, if you have those are they increase your."
1149.0,Patient,"It would probably be. I actually went if I went back right now I mean because i'm more I mean I am a they consider me a. i'm more of like an infrastructure i'm data they can stay said I don't got the title, but when I came here, they were going to give me the data Center manager global data Center manager sounded really great basically I didn't ever got the title but. i'm i'm more of a like a you know, an infrastructure, an infrastructure engineer data Center in you know managing data Center supervisor i've been an OPS manager it operations manager. yeah I do manage I do manager really I mean for me, I mean you know for me it's easy i'm I manage people real well as I can get different personalities, to work together really easily i've got a lot of years of doing that, but. When it comes to my weakness when it comes to that is. I suck at writing I i'm i'm one of those typical engineers don't ask him the right nothing. How many now you as far as a hardware engineer hardware engineers are you know they're they're like dinosaurs of the past, you know they don't know don't ask very many of them to write because they can't they can't write to save their life."
724.0,Provider,Well it's interesting. Like to the technology just get too far ahead like faster what's what's the reason for it.
1149.0,Patient,"For me it kind of got you know i'm 50 and 56 right so i'll be 57 this year it kind of for me it's kind of been an eye. I you know I got to where I wanted to go I don't really I don't really want to I mean you know yeah should be. You know I maybe you know, probably if I did go back and I just started really prioritizing like writing and being you know, being able to. You know, write real well and communicate in my writing real well because I can communicate real well and verbal but. I just i'm so busy, and I, and you know when you're busy, and you don't have a lot of sleep, like me, and you and your and you, you try to send an email, and you got people like 10 different people asking you 10 different things. yeah your emails sometimes don't make a lot of sense."
724.0,Provider,yeah not.
1149.0,Patient,"And that's kind of what it is now if I didn't have as much pressure and as much stress and I had a little more time to do that, you know I i'm good at that you know i'm i'm an ADHD guy so you know that's kind of been my you know, been my life is a you know dealing with ADHD. And, as I get older. Though you know I found that the more the higher the level of stress, the more the pressure I you know I got a guy sometimes have to pay attention to more than that and. that's when you know, Dr waters, when I was younger, I never had I was never on any medication, I never had take any of that, but about. I was so stressed out and so like really out there about, you know as far as that went about. Three years ago, when I first went in started working with Dr water she kind of noticed that, and she goes, have you you've been tested for ADHD and she and I go yeah and I I I have it. She goes, have you ever been on medication ever and I said no, my parents were like completely against that. yeah and so she actually she started me on some medication to help with like trying to concentrate a little more to help with that maybe help with the been able to write and communicate and have all that."
724.0,Provider,Different is a little bit.
1149.0,Patient,"Focusing a little more so she put she had she has me had me as me and as me on but I i've been on by Vance that point in time, but you know. By Vance I don't I don't like taking a high di tried taking a higher dose when she had me going up and trying to see where it would. You know where you could be and then where you start all man that stuff will prove I mean that, just like for me because medications for me normally it's like i'm. You know, really sent you like my mother medications for me route kind of I can they affect my body really quick. That. i've had weight loss surgery so anything I put in my body already will hit my system like like this. yeah."
724.0,Provider,i've heard five and it's like in high doses is like. You.
1149.0,Patient,"Know it'll wipe you out, I mean when I first was trying trying to figure it out, she had me on a cup for about a week on a higher dose and I literally I was like half the time I. I mean literally on the weekend couple of weekends, I was in bed sleeping because it was like the whole total too high and to really quick."
724.0,Provider,Right yeah that's.
1149.0,Patient,"How I just. Now I take like I take half a pill. Half a kilo in the morning. And then half a pill in the afternoon and I do, and I do, that every in every other day, and then I take shoot I forget the other medication, the other medication, I take half a pill that day that i'm not taking the vibe and. I forget what it was I got it I got it at home, now, you know I carry I carry my little pill tablet thing with me and I. I just I don't pay attention I haven't pay attention mental health, but I did that kind of I guess that kind of bridges that piece for a little bit and the other one you don't feel it is hardly at all, but it helps you so you don't have to take as much by Vance. Joe."
724.0,Provider,So outside of outside of the gig the how much for personal life that you.
1149.0,Patient,You probably can already figure that.
724.0,Provider,"out. So what is, what is your whole life could say."
1149.0,Patient,"None go home. You know i'm you know I have I you know I have my dog, I have two dogs i've had a i've you know, had a girlfriend off and on for 1718 years."
724.0,Provider,The the same owner.
1149.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
724.0,Provider,on and off.
1149.0,Patient,"The same one pretty much she two years ago, moved to Colorado to help take care of her mom. She so she's been there and then she comes back every about every five months once every five months she's come back. And you know that's kind of that's kind of on it's been like more it's right now it's kind of off, but we do we talk all the time we stay, you know kind of in touch we're kinda it's there but it's not they're kind of thing so."
724.0,Provider,she's still taking care of her family or.
1149.0,Patient,"yeah she's taking care of her mom. You know my mom my mom passed away and it's been a while now 2011 so. You know, we went I went through pretty bad time then she she she was there with me through that and then. You know her mom started getting sick and the she ended up moving to Colorado helping her brother and stuff so on my end she knows, I mean it's kind of what she knows to that you know i'm like a workaholic i've been trying to break that habit."
724.0,Provider,So me so far i'm. still struggling with a little bit.
1149.0,Patient,"Oh yeah i'm a typical bad workaholic where if I instead of instead of learning how to deal with stresses, I put it into the work. And, well, I pay attention to it and then, when I pay attention to it, I kind of try to work on it and try to try to work on. boundaries in place and try to bring it back in that way and that's that you know, Dr waters and everyday were helping me with that back then back to so that's kind of where we were working on stuff."
724.0,Provider,"Now, do you need do you need this financial. I guess cushion that this job provides to pay your bills to support your lifestyle or."
1149.0,Patient,"i've been that's one thing over the last couple years i've been i've been really concentrating on getting rid of all that stuff. yeah it's my it's my not that every any, but if you know the situations that happened, like my mom passing away, unfortunately, I mean that's that was, I mean that really got me that turned me upside down for a while. Because we were pretty really close. You know her passing away and then and then my about the now it's been on three years, my grandmother my not my grandmother cashing away. You know my grandmother left left left left us a House my mother left us property. me and my younger brother there's three of us me and my younger brother had bought property back in 1987 we bought a four plex that jet we just fold that. Four months, five months ago. So that and then we've been kind of dealing with figuring out when you know the. The money and the amount of money that you know from my mother's House and all that financial stuff if I look if I if I think about that I stress out because, if I had that money all the money that that way I wouldn't have to work. Okay, I is, let me put it that way, if I took the money that from the sale of the four plex the port my my share my mother's House and my grandmother's house, I could put that into a a payback have a bank account, and I could live on that and not have to work."
724.0,Provider,I was thinking Where are you located here in San Francisco answer.
1149.0,Patient,"i'm in China, I live in San Jose, and so my my mother's House was right near Los gatos I needed a mother's house was when we figured out when it got sold was 1.5. My we just sold a four plex for 1.4. So. You add that money together you start thinking numbers, if I think about those numbers I just I try not to right now, because you know it's my it's my family, so my brother and it's just a matter of you know. Trying to he's trying to get stuff situated and then we're supposed to work it out. So i'm just hoping that that happens. This you know part of my part of what I live in I live in the House my grandmother my grandmother lived in that we she's had since you know i've ever known it, you know they have it, since you know they bought a new. Though I I live in that House now I moved out of my mother's House I live I moved, I had a condo and Campbell. When my mom got sick I moved home and then, when she passed away I lived there for five years, I help take care of my stepfather as my you know that was one of the deal so for five years, took care of him, and then, then he had to go into a home moved out of that and. Then moved into my grandmother's House my grandmother's house is paid off, so I don't have a mortgage payment. So that that's i've worked through that stuff to wear my bills on a monthly basis i'm getting them down to where if I. sell one I have, I have one, for I have two car payments if I had one car payment. I could, I could walk away from this job and go work a 35 or $40 an hour job and probably not even sweat that. So. But if you know Dutch that. My last bill is that second car payment okay. So that hoping i'm hoping if I get rid of that. that'd be. About almost. Almost. 600 almost $700 month. With insurance."
724.0,Provider,What kind of cars.
1149.0,Patient,"That I I don't have fan, I have a 23rd 2013 Toyota Tacoma I have a car payment on that and I have a. shoe grew legacy of 2015 and I have a payment on that."
724.0,Provider,"yeah you got the you got the good year so colin's. yeah I like that body, so all of them. Are once all the water enough to the newer ones, but I did."
1149.0,Patient,"want a little bit warm enough to have but I I had at Java at all I kind of all. If I would have done it, I mean, I had a 2008 which was perfect, it was a long bed Florida or two oma and I did everything for that I wanted to it was perfect, it would have been paid off and that I didn't you know I even put my I even put a new motor and training in it. When I bought a little mile one, and then I ended up selling it for for this one. But now I figured i'll just i'll keep this one pay this thing off and that can be done with it."
724.0,Provider,"yeah what uh what trend packets, you have on it."
1149.0,Patient,"This one, the reason I traded to from my other one was an asr five. yeah right and this one's a TRT fully loaded TRT off road."
724.0,Provider,Oh nice good there you go. Those are the best ones i'll see ya.
1149.0,Patient,"know this one has, I mean literally I didn't want leather seats that as a limited package that's, the only thing that this one does not have. I don't want the leather seats, so I other than that dish as everything."
724.0,Provider,yeah yeah they still sell for so much money like.

724.0,Provider,yeah.
1149.0,Patient,"And I only Oh, I think I owe. 25 I think on this one."
724.0,Provider,"Now, when you make payments, you make, like the like the minimum payment do you pay any towards print like anything extra towards principle."
1149.0,Patient,"I I was for a while and then. And then I was trying, I was paying off my other I I. I ran into some issues that took me about four and a half years to fix. yeah and right right before I came into breitbart I I literally was just starting to finish irs problems because of a business that I went in I was trying to retire quicker. yeah so I went into business with some two other friends of mine that I used to be friends of mine, we thought a up in. Stockton, we opened a opened up a collective. Six years ago, seven years ago, and we had one of the largest we were we were the number one after less than four months, we were the number one collective up there, they were like six of them and people were traveling from here to there. up there and I wasn't part of it because I couldn't be but. We basically you know we were the number one collective around the bear. For a lot for a while and they ended up in which, since I wasn't involved in it, they ended up embezzling all the money not paying any of the taxes and my name was on the. You probably already can go down that road, my name is not the Federal and State. taxes for sales tax so."
724.0,Provider,"You can probably already how much money, I was buried for."
1149.0,Patient,Three years paying off.
724.0,Provider,wow and you. Know like clear your name from it.
1149.0,Patient,"Oh man, I had the board of equalization was after me for for for five about you, is five five years. I lost I lost my for my job that I really was kind of hoping to keep I lost that because they you know 00 tolerance and. You know most companies, they have that zero tolerance in California, then when the board of equalization was coming after me and they found out I ended up losing that job so. But i've crawled out of all that I just got my last letter from the Federal for 2020 taxes, and I only oh. I only have 1600 left on that. And I oh $500 on. On my 2018 taxes and then i'm tax free from about $150,000 in taxes."
724.0,Provider,that's a nightmare.
1149.0,Patient,"yep it was so I crawled out I did crawl out of all that, so now i'm just I have you know about two grand worth of irs federal taxes that I owe because the state. The State came the state came after me for everything they were doing that asset seizures on me all everywhere and took everything just about."
724.0,Provider,Well that'd be a huge weight off your shoulders on.
1149.0,Patient,"Net now. yeah that was from looking at that's driving cross when I got out of that. Now that i'm getting here to this place now i'm now i'm trying to get Chateau little more settled and I paid off pretty much everything except my consent bought my car payment get rid of one and I have one car payment and then. Once I do that then i'm free on the pretty much almost almost in a really, really decent place."
724.0,Provider,"I mean it sounds like you could probably get there in a couple of years, you know if you. yep or sooner if the bang on that stuff comes together quicker with you and your brother."
1149.0,Patient,"Yes, yep."
724.0,Provider,"Okay, so you got options."

724.0,Provider,abridged version of it.
1149.0,Patient,blend a blender blender full of everything.
724.0,Provider,"it's interesting I like these, the like I like getting like the like the bits and pieces and then you know as time goes on, you start formulating like like the entire story. Like I don't mind yeah yeah it's always easy to to to give people like like the bullet points it's like. be like i've told this story a million times so here's the long and the short of it this this this Thank you and it's like I appreciate that I like the the direct approach rather than like the route about approach."
1149.0,Patient,yeah.
724.0,Provider,that's good so have you left work yet are you.
1149.0,Patient,"waiting to leave, oh no i'm actually i'm I was sitting in the parking lot I figured i'd you know I if I was going to work a few more hours, but after i'm done here i'm heading home. But if I didn't if we didn't have our meeting tonight I probably would have been working until about another about 838 39 o'clock."
724.0,Provider,"And then what's hurting like get home and then turn around and come right back with you, we."
1149.0,Patient,"get home I get home about you know if I left here at 830 get home it'd be about nine 945 949 45. Speed my dogs, you know I you know I did I did have I did have a roommate up until like yes yeah he just dumped bad on me yesterday but. I did I that's one thing that was good i've had a roommate for the last couple years living in my house so. You know I gave him a really good break because he he didn't he likes dogs so you'd walk my dog once you know, once a day and kind of take care of my dogs because i'm not there a lot so that's been nice but i'm not going to have that so. I gotta worry about that next."
724.0,Provider,What kind of dogs are the.
1149.0,Patient,"Little two little dogs, I have, I have a little miniature schnauzer and a little and a little yorkie that i've had in my you know reason I kinda wanna I try to have been trying to have a roommate is my yorkie and now. she's 10 years old, so she's getting up there in years, and so I don't I kind of yeah I kind of worry about her. Right now, at this age, because they're. You know it's almost like you can't say day to day but it's kind of like you know month, a month with that dog is her age and a couple of the issue, she has."
724.0,Provider,"not going to say I thought, like the I thought the small dogs live longer than the bigger ones."
1149.0,Patient,"know there, the problem is with the smaller dogs like. There every their their issues are are different, so they actually can pass away a lot faster. Right older dogs are. Older dogs have like the you know the longer times of the problems like arthritis and all that stuff that takes longer to get them. Smaller dogs, like the yorkie they have problems with breathing their their esophagus and stuff as they get older the muscles soften and relax and then they end up choking to death, usually that's done for that set but that's usually what happens."
724.0,Provider,"No Christ I didn't even know that. yeah kind of the market for a dog and we got the last song that I had was a pitbull and he was like like one of the big ones like you know as most heavy you know, he was like 110."

1149.0,Patient,"now see your keys are normally good dog bills are really good dog so and so is the schnauzer the miniature schnauzer, however. I mean it all depends on I mean let's share see if you're looking for a dog, the best thing I can do, I try to tell people is. Go to somebody that knows dogs and work with them for like work with them for about a week or two and have them go through what dog is good for you, rather than what you. think you want from a dog because. Normally I i'm not a I wasn't a dog like a little dog person. yeah, but when I went and I found Li mei mei mei mei yorkie, the only thing I wish you know they gave me a really good deal, but I know why is because I think a lot of people took them took her to the vet and they ran They ran a they can do some tests on them, and it a test on her. They call it esophagus their software deal whatever they call back. And I think that's they found that they say, well, when she gets older she's going to have this problem so some people who want actually in a Casey registered dog will do that because she is actually an aka see register dog. And so they actually I mean I got her instead of pain like 2500 or $3,000. You know the lady in Brentwood actually gave her to me for $900."
724.0,Provider,"A little yeah I was. I was looking at because I might be allergic to dogs allergic to cats, but I don't know if i'm allergic to dogs i'm still waiting to find out. But I was looking at like the medium sized schnauzer just because they're hypoallergenic and they're kind of cool looking and like for like the type of bleeding."
1149.0,Patient,"hauser get a miniature schnauzer the one that I have. she's hyper allergenic and she she doesn't have dandruff and she's got the soft that what the miniature schnauzer isn't a purebred schnauzer. that's what they are is like a St Charles and a schnauzer. And a little bit a little tiny or dog mine has like the long it's long I send you a picture, but she got a long brown dark dark chocolate hair. And it's really soft it's not wiring. And she's more like they can save instead of delay, I got her from a breeder that was you know she wasn't she didn't have papers but she. May when they said she was a purebred miniature schnauzer but all the vets and everybody that i've seen her They all said she's like she's an awesome little schnauzer but they didn't think that she was completely a purebred. So, but they are a schnauzer, if you like, if both. yeah schnauzer has the same. kind of almost the same personality."
724.0,Provider,yeah i'm looking for like intelligence and loyalty and.
1149.0,Patient,"sadness now or she is man she you can train, I mean literally if I really spent the time with Zoe man, she is like the smartest dog I think i've ever seen, I mean she's like you can you can train her and she she'll do anything like right away."
724.0,Provider,"Okay yeah you know my last dog like he died somewhat abruptly on me at nine nine years and broke my heart, and that was. it's probably going on, like four years now and i've just finally coming back around to the idea of potentially getting another one, you know I got I got two toddlers too so. My girlfriend's encouraging me to to get another dog for the kids so the kids will have something for like a attachment and also attachment bond. And i'm coming around to it, you know, like the guy I mean he wants like like a big Brutus dog, but I gotta be like responsible to and, if I have allergies like. To cats and I might have four dogs too, so I needed like a loop for hypoallergenic I had surgery back in July because I had like like real bad nasal stuff and they bought out like my terminates and stuff and."

But it's been like the first time that i've actually had air being able to pass in my nose and like 20 something years so it's been nice, so I definitely don't want to have a setback and get an animal that allergic to so I don't want to do that necessarily but. So I figured I bought a dog but there's just not a lot of hypoallergenic dogs out there that are cool you know first off. You know, especially for like."
1149.0,Patient,"A day is look at a look at a like I, like you know, look at the medium sized now but look look for a miniature schnauzer. yeah online they have them and they're really, really, I mean Zoe is probably for kids would probably I mean literally be the best I mean foes Bella but. As for a schnauzer she's like she pays attention more than Bella does, I mean she pays attention she's smart show like she looks around at stuff and try and like. Like protecting and wanting to run like looking I could tell with kids she'd be a really, really good dog. yeah they say that yeah."
724.0,Provider,"Like hurting dogs anyways so lightly there they have like that. Organizational Structure like and then we're. Like Okay, we need something to be tidy so they like heard humid so yeah i've done.

Can I saw that I got to help me. You know, through that whole time. So that was i'm literally it was like right when she writes about two months, three months before she passed away. I got her kind of like you know when I brought her, I was bringing her over there, my mom you know she had cancer and. Was sick and I got her and I, you know at the time and then kind of I got really attached or that kind of she helped me out kind of getting through that whole that whole time that all that, from that."
724.0,Provider,"They really do help though you don't I mean like like. Having having the animal it's it's the first animal that like she was trained, you know way way back in our DNA be like the first you know first wall, for the first human that became companions like that's deeply rooted our DNA is dogs are crucial to like our development and. See security and the things that you get from them like you can't really put put in the word sometimes like like the inner peace that I got my dog was around like I didn't worry."
1149.0,Patient,About yeah.
724.0,Provider,"I didn't worry about shot me with August was around I lived in a real bad neighborhood because when you have a pit bull nobody friends to. Others are terrible. area but, like, I never once had any complaints people saw that dog they stayed away, you know what I mean like. Like."
1149.0,Patient,"The other mean I think my dog my dog would like the emotional part of it, where I come home from work because i'd be stressed out or whatever. You know, and you know emotionally, I mean all all I if I sat on the couch or late on the couch she jumped right on top of me, you know if I was laying on the couch she'd lay on me or sitting on a couch she'd be like you're sitting on my lap."
724.0,Provider,Right.
1149.0,Patient,Now is kind of to kind of dog she is yeah.
724.0,Provider,"yeah I got I got my dog when I separated from the military I had because I was back then. After a year, you know what I mean like like your vacation time, essentially, you would accrue like like two days a month, so that, like every every year you'd have 30 days worth of leave."
1149.0,Patient,"You know, pro yeah."
724.0,Provider,"If you didn't take any and because I was deployed all the time. When I came back by unit would give us like two weeks off COMP time essentially calm time it didn't cost me anything my leaves so I never took leave you know for the longest time and then. When I got out the most that I could carry over was excuse me, was 60 days. Because I had more so, I had a burn some early and then I had 60 days, which was the Max that I can add So when I separated from the for the military I I technically separated two months early because I went on what they would call terminal leave. So I took my 60 days and then my 60 days was up I hit my contract and they and then I was done so during those 60 days i'm still getting paid fairly well and I was bored so I was like hey I want to be with his dog. And I found it like it's like a penny flyer whatever it was that picture this dog and, like the puppy was like chewing the cage a little bit I was like this dog is cute I want to go get it. And I went to the place was a breeder and I saw the dog and hit he wanted nothing to do with me and I was perfect so i'm going to get him and. So for like the next few months, like like literally every waking moment that I had I I spent with the dog I train them up like on leash off leash like I just invested all my time and energy, the dog and then. You know, like I left that base and i'm like i've moved back home my family and stuff and a dog was with me like everywhere, he was like the most consistent thing in my life and I like when most people leave service they leave any kind of long term commitment like that. Major depression like I had like I had a rough spot and my life like I lost purpose and direction and all that kind of so all those things."
1149.0,Patient,Are yeah.
724.0,Provider,"yeah like being a young man and having no real direction, coming from a place where you had all the direction you know be empty so having him was like the most consistent thing that I had for a long time so like what he did pass like it like it devastated me like to my core."
1149.0,Patient,Oh yeah I saw man yeah.
724.0,Provider,"yeah and that's what they'll you know they're. They come to you like, when you need them the most and like they devastate you just as equally and it's only been like fairly recently that like I can talk about it, without not being like broken up about it, but you know, for what they do for us man it's so."
1149.0,Patient,"it's so cool yeah. yeah Oh, and I yeah no i'm. I mean, as you go down that road, I like i'm a big dog person and for military guys and the guys with ptsd and stuff that I mean dogs for them will man yeah that's like that would keep them like completely out of air everything that they need almost from an APP from a dog, you know."
724.0,Provider,"So it is important, you don't I mean like yeah it's definitely important to have those those connections, especially with like you know, the environment and and they come from a place that's. You know, deeply rooted in nature, so we connect with that on all kinds of psychological and biological level so yeah I yeah I agree with your with your concern is the dog beta priority now that your roommates not there, so."
1149.0,Patient,yeah kinda like you know that now yeah that's one of the things i'm thinking about cuz yeah. that's kind of where it up me a little bit more The night before last I started them a man now I really gotta. I really got a ramp up being closer to the House are either that i'm gonna have to bring her up here closer to where I am and add a you know at a place or a daycare or something yeah not not to be at home by herself as much.

724.0,Provider,"Though that sucks. That sucks it's only temporary, though, think of it that way, like every time you drive it could be tomorrow that you don't have to make that drive anymore so. yeah that that would be like the one caveat that I would carry with me."
1149.0,Patient,"that's that I mean right now i'm getting phone calls and stuff and places are actually on you know kind of, I guess, fortunately, and unfortunately here today, they just announced that they were going to come back October 4 but now they're pushing it to November."

1149.0,Patient,"yeah and that that will put that one product that's probably gonna help. lift a little bit of this of this everybody pushing to get every project done before the fourth because literally I was they were actually almost asking me to get a hotel room down the street, so I could even be spending more time Murphy."
724.0,Provider,"Like only if you're going to pay for it. Exactly so. yeah maybe I can, Sir, and then you could bring your dog up be like it's got to be pet friendly because I got."
