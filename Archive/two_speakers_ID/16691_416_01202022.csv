416.0,Provider,"Thank you yeah. yeah i've been I didn't own any makeup until very recently, like literally didn't even own it and then I I was getting married, so I. bought all this makeup for my wedding. And then I was like well if i'm going to spend this obscene amount of money on stupid makeup I should probably were in one in one day. So just to like assuage my guilt is spending all that money, I decided, I was going to put some on today sorry, thank you."
16691.0,Patient,it's good.
416.0,Provider,i'm very bad at being a girl sometimes. So not my thing. How are you.
16691.0,Patient,"I am good I am tired, but i'm good."
416.0,Provider,yeah have you been losing sleep a little better.
16691.0,Patient,"I haven't slept well probably like four or five days and then yesterday was my girlfriend's birthday, we didn't do anything with I was just awake until 1230 and I get up at five so i'm i'm feeling today."
416.0,Provider,"But tonight, going to be an early night to make up for it."
16691.0,Patient,"Yes, yes. My best is coming in from New York, but i'm picking her up from the airport at seven and you're coming here and going to bed when i'm tired, I can."
416.0,Provider,"Well you're not I mean that's going to be quite a trip for you, though, has the airport's not close to you, is it. Sorry, that was my."
16691.0,Patient,it's about 20 minutes away.
416.0,Provider,"Right now, because i'm coordinating pickup this there's you know you appreciate this whole. text. I don't want to go to Africa, Africa, no, I want to play date with so and so that know who's gonna pick you up Okay, but what. I spend more time organizing your social calendar than mine."
16691.0,Patient,Right.
416.0,Provider,that's mine again sorry.
16691.0,Patient,You want to get it.
416.0,Provider,No it's already did it's okay. yeah so you've been having some fun how has the. We talked last time about kind of working on tuning in and then seeing kind of what's driving we can pin down a little bit more of what's driving that kind of like the operating good extremes. Many of that come up this week.
16691.0,Patient,"This week, let me get clear on the week I usually prepare and I didn't have time to prepare this time. Wait let me look at my notes from last week sorry."
416.0,Provider,"No worries, we can just kind of roll with it i'm home for that. that's the opposite extreme thinking i'm totally into it."
16691.0,Patient,"my daughter to when I get back at 245. I was too tired so. let's see our last one online was January seven. behaviors of feelings. come from operating money. Like I don't have notes you're talking about we talked about Oh, the relationship stuff with my mom."
416.0,Provider,"yeah We talked we talked about also that. Yes, we talked about a little bit of that. The. Man doesn't define me having a man doesn't define my life right."
16691.0,Patient,But I was supposed to be noticing when. My extremes happened.
416.0,Provider,"yeah yeah I mean so just me to say how it happens, the week God, have you found felt like or the last two weeks have you felt like you've been kind of operating an extreme still."
16691.0,Patient,"Yes, but I think just putting a label on it has made it better, because now, I can see what i'm doing it So yes, yes, yes, OK OK OK, yes, yes, so, for example, last night. Instead of we just went to my girlfriend's House we ordered food and we had drinks. But I knew like I don't want to be late, I don't want to drink excessively so, I took one bottle of wine when normally I would take a bottle of gin. Which leads to too many drinks and then me wanting to go out and just you know all the way, like it's your birthday, I took one bottle of wine, I did have three glasses, but for me that's like. And then I came home and went to that I also brought my own food because i've been trying to. Not just eat what's in front of me and I knew if I didn't bring my own food, I was going to just eat everything I was going to drink too much, which will lead me to eat too much of bad stuff, and so I guess just knowing that about myself, which I knew it before, but I think, for some reason."
416.0,Provider,i'm sorry brandy. are sorry.
16691.0,Patient,i'm going to.
416.0,Provider,"I don't know why this has to be so complicated. Okay, so you've got a few examples of times when you would normally have kind of like operated at extremes, but you were able to kind of think ahead realized that you didn't want to deal with the consequences of that and plan something out to be a little more moderate."
16691.0,Patient,"I knew there would be no DJ in there, so I specifically left mine at home, which normally i'm retaken. And I took one bottle of white wine and I had three glasses, but I, and I felt a little buzz but not like how I would normally keep going I was like okay. And this is enough, like, I know I have to get up at five and it's going to be brutal and normally I would have just thrown caution to the wind and been like if it. Were partying it's your birthday. So I was actually kind of like proud of myself for that. And now her dad's texting I come at 545 yes so. And there, there have also been some times, where."
416.0,Provider,I might get it.
16691.0,Patient,"There were also there's also been a couple of times, where like. She I I written out a schedule the things that I wanted to do this week to prepare for my best friend coming, so I wanted to like switch my rug out and do this and do that and I didn't get to all of it, but I just. For the first time, I would say, either in a long time or ever I gave myself a break, and I was just like. A it's my best friend like."
416.0,Provider,she's not judging yeah.
16691.0,Patient,"doesn't care like she. Does not for first and foremost be i'm tired and i'm not sleeping well why am I going to make myself even more tired doing something that doesn't matter like I was able to. Think about each thing and really rationally say is this necessary, do you really need to do this, like. Or are you just being brandi like are you just focusing on these things and it's a checklist and act to finish it because, if I don't, then the world and it's like. And so my road did not get switched I might I might not their laundry that needs to be done, it may or may not get done but i'm just like. relax the world will go on you."
416.0,Provider,left.
16691.0,Patient,"that's huge for me like. Huge because after therapy on Tuesday. I think that was when it really clicked when I was like it just all started coming together everyone was talking about like there should is in the woods and you know all the madness. And when I was explaining my example and you said well let's not take this as an opportunity to bash ourselves i'm like yes, there right i'm doing the same thing, like. One know and trying to be a better person."
416.0,Provider,I love that.
16691.0,Patient,"So. It just like started to click in my mind. For some reason, after Tuesday, and so the rest of the week well those couple of days became like. What you can do is what you can do and what you can't is what you can and again let's put it in perspective, this is just your apartment it's not like you know no one's going to see it. I always play this thing, in my mind like it's kind of morbid but I either say what if there's an emergency and someone has to come in to like shut off the lights or turn off the water or something in my place looks crazy a they're not going to care."
416.0,Provider,Because they're at where they're not.
16691.0,Patient,Why did you choose your place I don't give a Fuck what it looks like or I go into this really morbid place and i'm like. it's embarrassing to say it out loud.
416.0,Provider,Like What if you die.
16691.0,Patient,Like What if I die.
416.0,Provider,you'd be surprised how common that thought is.
16691.0,Patient,Is it i'm always like I want a I want people be able to find things and I also even after death I want them to be like oh that was brandi everything's in order like.
416.0,Provider,"Well, I mean so it's a value of yours, and I, and I don't want you to totally get rid of your values it's just that, when. When like this value kind of starts to morph into super compulsive behavior. right that it hurts you right so it's it there's a there's a middle somewhere in there. And it's. it's going to be a dance right it's like sometimes it sometimes you're going to feel uncomfortable without dirty or messy or whatever your houses. And and you'll have to kind of tolerate it like newsflash you're going to survive it it'll be okay, and then other times you're going to be like no I mean I This is important to me, I have the energy and ugliness. Right ready it'll fluctuate and that's operating in the middle right that's operating and more."
16691.0,Patient,Like yeah. I guess that's where i'm trying to get to.
416.0,Provider,Because like you did a really good job about this week. yeah.
16691.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
416.0,Provider,"I was gonna, and so we talked a little bit about the workflow workbook. The dpt work yeah and the bonus section. Yes, coal mine up."
16691.0,Patient,I need to open it up and go back to.
416.0,Provider,I don't know if you had a chance to look at it at all.
16691.0,Patient,"Barely i'm not going to pretend I like. It. and read a few lines, and then I don't know what I did like."
416.0,Provider,Okay let's look at it together anyway it's more fun that way.
16691.0,Patient,"been kind of crazy I don't know why. Okay, I have it open, though."
416.0,Provider,I haven't been to but it's like.
16691.0,Patient,I said i'm applying for this.
416.0,Provider,find the right direction. we're going to. yeah.
16691.0,Patient,"analyzing behaviors six right, I did that seven did that and then eight we did the missing links mindfulness Okay, here it is."
416.0,Provider,So I think if you go to mindfulness handout one a.
16691.0,Patient,One a yes mindfulness.
416.0,Provider,"The definitions of mindfulness and i'm wondering if these definitions, because you know I know that you do a lot of yoga you do some meditation. and art are these definitions new to you or like a different twist on things, or is this kind of how you had already understood mindfulness."
16691.0,Patient,"intentionally living with awareness in the present moment waking up from automatic he. lives without judging and rejecting the moment without attachment to the moment, yes, this is exactly what I meant on mindfulness to be. able to practice that we put together makeup my. mindfulness and mindfulness skills. Yes."
416.0,Provider,Okay. The part that I was really struck by when I was thinking of you around mindfulness is the waking up from automatic or wrote behaviors.
16691.0,Patient,mm hmm.
416.0,Provider,"Right so it's it's exactly kind of what you started working on. This week, really, which is. You sort of do have these like we all do, by the way these sort of automatic responses to things right there pattern response that we built over time that probably started out as a really functional thing. And then, over time, those automatic responses have not become way less functional for us so. And so kind of waking up. To them, and noticing them, which is what you did, and then being mindful and going. i'm not going to make that same choice i'm going to do things a little bit different i'm going to take back a little bit of that control."
16691.0,Patient,"mm hmm yes, yes."
416.0,Provider,"Okay, so moving past that I think we talked earlier now remind me if we go to the next section did we talk a little bit about the states of mind. and wise mind."
16691.0,Patient,"We talked about that I think in group, because I have notes about it."
416.0,Provider,"Okay. All right, so if you're going to mindfulness handout three, it has a really nice visual."
16691.0,Patient,"Okay. Reasonable mind emotion line wise but yes, we talked with yeah we talked about this and."
416.0,Provider,"and This is. Like and to the same venn diagram we could put it like place it over. polarizing thinking too right. So there's sort of. Their sort of the the reasonable mind I don't like that word, because it seems a little bit misleading, it sounds. It sounds like a really good thing we're not actually."
16691.0,Patient,yeah that's like the like without emotion right you're just like yeah.
416.0,Provider,"ruled by facts reason logic and pragmatics values and feelings are not important in this one. Right and then so. If we look at some polarizing thinking right those those brain weasels those cognitive distortions. We can look at those as like kind of bouncing and between this right, so you end up like kind of on the extreme side reasonable mind. And then you skip right over wise mind and you just sort of pop way over to the emotional night and sort of just vacillate between the two, and never really exist in the middle in this wise mind."
16691.0,Patient,That is me.
416.0,Provider,"mm hmm so that's where we're going to work, this is where we're starting and. I love the way they put it here right the wise mind is the wisdom within. Because you have that wisdom. and and seeing truly seeing the value of a blend right reason and emotion and the blend and bringing the right brain and left brain together and walking the middle path."
16691.0,Patient,mm hmm.
416.0,Provider,"So there's some in an expert sheet there's some examples of like different specifically different exercises that you can use i'm gonna. i'm gonna let you do these ones on your own, and the one that I like the most are the asking wise mind a question."
16691.0,Patient,Okay.
416.0,Provider,"So, like if you find yourself. kind of moving toward the extreme."
16691.0,Patient,hmm.
416.0,Provider,"Sometimes just even pausing. Taking a breath and saying, if I were in wise mind right now well right. Right right in my lifetime say."
16691.0,Patient,yeah kind of like that. But instead it's. Like yeah yeah what would be the.
416.0,Provider,"program you delegate. I have this colleague that stole my friend and my last job he was like. I have like kind of a big corporate whatever. I was like super young and totally to know what I was doing, and he was awesome he totally was like had his stuff together and I felt like such an imposter and I used to tell him all the time that I was going to put on a bracelet that said WW bd what would be redo. Constantly thanked him. But it's not a bad idea right just be like what would my wise mind do what would somebody who's always you know somebody you know who's always in their wives my do like channel and that's okay."
16691.0,Patient,yeah yeah because normally i'm in what would brandi do i'm in automatic. Well brandi wouldn't have a messy home brandi wouldn't do this brain he wouldn't do that and it's like well you're creating who you are. And that's not really who you are i'm creating this like version of myself that's not really who I am instead of just really trying to be the best version of me.
416.0,Provider,"yeah. Well it's funny a lot of the stuff that you're talking about like a clean house and the being beautiful and having lots of stuff I mean all of that stuff is great, I think we run definitely not saying like let go of that. But a lot of it isn't who you are it's what you look like to the outside."
16691.0,Patient,Right.
416.0,Provider,"Right, a lot of it is perception that you described when I hear you describe these things. The time that I hear you the most say who you are really is when you talk about your daughter yourself as a mom."
16691.0,Patient,yeah yeah yeah. Which is. odd because I never wanted to be like.
416.0,Provider,I don't think. What.
16691.0,Patient,you're not supposed to be.
416.0,Provider,"it's Okay, as long as it's not group."
16691.0,Patient,Oh okay.
416.0,Provider,hi.
16691.0,Patient,"I forgot what I was saying, will speak don't be rude right."
416.0,Provider,what's your name live. live. yeah I love. By live.
16691.0,Patient,"um. shoot I forgot what I was saying. Oh that's odd that you say that or that I knew that's what you were gonna say because. Part of like the brandy perceived brandy is the person is like not that kind of mom like. My child doesn't change, who I am and my child i'm my own person is like girl like my sweatshirt literally says mom getting like that's what. I. think you."
416.0,Provider,"said, I mean it doesn't have to be your whole identity but it's a part of it."
16691.0,Patient,I think I just fought against it so much that. I fought against it so much.
416.0,Provider,That was mine coming home.
16691.0,Patient,"I just realized that I think. The extremes is probably somewhere rooted in that idea that. i'm still who I am like i'm still fun and I still go out and I still can drink and I can still do this, and I can still do that because, when I wasn't a mom I used to think. Like when people said, oh no, I can only have like two or three glasses of wine, I would be like a lame you know, and so, when I became a mom I didn't want to lose that part of me. And I think, maybe that's why I cling so tightly to when she's not here it's time for me to be me, you know and like let loose but really."
416.0,Provider,it's almost like there's two different brandies.
16691.0,Patient,"Yes, yes, and I think I said that a long time, like in one of my first sessions that."
416.0,Provider,When i'm.
16691.0,Patient,"it's like when they text me the next day, and they say something that that brand new would be like i'm like. Why, because now i'm back to like mom it's Monday I don't. they're like Oh, what are you doing i'm getting ready for bed it's 930 but the person that they met is like it's 930 i'm ready to go out, you know, so it. I had a guy tell me to when we were out he's like I bet you are the complete opposite person when you're not drinking and I was laughing like you're so right, not even realize it's not a compliment. um."
416.0,Provider,"Well, so it's not. Not not a compliment right, I mean in a lot of ways, you found a really interesting way to kind of balance. These two parts of you that are both really important. But the but the total split and between the two is pretty crazy making. yeah right and that's where we start to get into these extremes, so I think you know you never really were able to or had an opportunity to kind of work through integrating these two very different parts of yourself you've instead you've kept them extremely separate."
16691.0,Patient,"yeah like even dating it's like I date every other weekend when she's not here, I don't like try to get a babysitter so that I can go out on a Saturday and she's with me or I mean I will lie that's a lie, I will but it wouldn't be for date, it would be like to go hang out with my girlfriend. For some reason, like a date i'm going to find a babysitter on the weekend shoot with me to go out with some guy no but my girlfriends who I guess are not, I guess, who are important to me. diem."
416.0,Provider,who's they're not as separate.
16691.0,Patient,yeah they are right right they're not separate there in my there in.
416.0,Provider,My whole entire world to yeah yeah.
16691.0,Patient,"They are yeah because. My friends are like odds to her like there she calls them on T you know Katrina aunty JI JI are on my because they're my sisters and they're like. they're in my world where I think I guess I look at men as being completely in a different world, and you have to prove that you deserve to be in that other world."
416.0,Provider,And everybody fall short.
16691.0,Patient,Ultimately.
416.0,Provider,"yeah I mean, most of them don't even really make it past like the first step right."
16691.0,Patient,Second date like whatever yeah yeah. Which is really like not even getting to know me. yeah.
416.0,Provider,So there's that part of you that's like and that's the kind of wild brandi feels the need to really protect other brandi. Right.
16691.0,Patient,Yes.
416.0,Provider,"you're keeping those. So. I can understand how that would be. How, that would be really hard to manage all of that right, it would be exhausting. Is yeah."
16691.0,Patient,It is.
416.0,Provider,So it kind of comes back and a lot of ways to like who is brandy now.
16691.0,Patient,Right.
416.0,Provider,"She doesn't have to be two different people like who, who is she now because you're a lot of things I great you're not just one thing you're complicated your beautifully intricate and complex."
16691.0,Patient,I guess I don't even know.
416.0,Provider,yeah.
16691.0,Patient,i'm really know.
416.0,Provider,Okay. This is something we can start exploring.
16691.0,Patient,"Live that's no. No, no. Yes, no, no, I can't even think."
416.0,Provider,What.
16691.0,Patient,know where to start like figuring out.
416.0,Provider,"Sometimes, if you can't if you're having a hard time starting it from yourself like you know saying it yourself. You can start a couple different places, when you could start with the things you do know about yourself right. And just start there."
16691.0,Patient,Let me make a note.
416.0,Provider,"And then you can, if that's not a very long list. And you can channel the people who know you best. Not the people you protect. necessarily. But, like the people who, and maybe this is like your closest girlfriends your best friend whatever but, like the people who really truly know you, you can even ask you've got your best friend coming. You can even ask her to help you with us like. Who really is branding I mean not even she used to be not who she was back in college or whatever like but who are you now."
16691.0,Patient,"Right. And the crazy thing is, I think they were both i'm thinking of two in particular, two people are together, I think they would both say some of the same thing. I guess it's just. it's the word not rectifying. what's the word i'm. yeah well or like making my mind believe what they're saying to be true. yeah yeah."
416.0,Provider,"it's Okay, if you know. But. Maybe ask them anyway and let's let's get let's start to get a picture. Oh, I just lost your audio somehow."
16691.0,Patient,huh.
416.0,Provider,"Oh, there you are. Your audio cut out for a SEC."
16691.0,Patient,yeah. I just learned something new about myself.
416.0,Provider,that's therapy.
16691.0,Patient,Right right right. Right. Everyone needs therapy.
416.0,Provider,Everyone.
16691.0,Patient,believes a women have superpowers and we don't need anything from me.
416.0,Provider,"Women do have superpowers, but we need their be to."
16691.0,Patient,You don't believe that I really. Good.
416.0,Provider,"No Okay, how do we, how do we fine tune our superpowers and help them grow and get stronger if we don't work on ourselves."
16691.0,Patient,"well. Yes, i'm in therapy. But you do."
416.0,Provider,have your mom just has a really weird therapist who also has a candy rage.
16691.0,Patient,"Hello. super women, women are stronger than men were the best for this or that I wonder is that odd. No okay. Great Okay, I think it's great, but I think a lot of things that aren't great great better great."
416.0,Provider,"I mean my son would probably disagree with her, but."
16691.0,Patient,that's the point.
416.0,Provider,she's for sure entitled to our opinion.
16691.0,Patient,"Okay, wait, you can keep no. Thank you."
416.0,Provider,So i'm. Your mindfulness practices that you do you they're mostly incorporated with your yoga right.
16691.0,Patient,"Yes, well, no I meditate every morning so that's."
416.0,Provider,A little bit more about your meditation.
16691.0,Patient,Are graded or just like attached like I started one because of the other okay.
416.0,Provider,So tell me about the meditation when you do the meditation separately. What what is like do you do like a meditation APP or is it just you So how do you do.
16691.0,Patient,"I just sit up close my eyes. If I if my mind, is really racy like really off the charts then i'll do the breathe in for six brief hold it for for breathe out for six whole different for like box breathing. i'll do that or I if my mind, is somewhat settled, which means, like everything my world is kind of Okay, then I can actually sit with quietness and I just try to see. there's like shooting stars when I when you close your eyes, I try to focus on those and just not think about anything else, so I look I just I Evan flow between those two sometimes if i'm having like. Like if just everything is going wrong, then I do I use. mala beads and I just say i'm becoming a better brandy everyday becoming a better brand do today, just to like tell myself, you know. I love gather your five so it's one of those three depending on."
416.0,Provider,Can I offer a. Possible mantra.
16691.0,Patient,With you please.
416.0,Provider,"i'm sorry, so a possible mantra and you know change whatever However, the sounds best to you, but some version of like. I. I am walking the middle ground I choose to walk the middle ground. I am worthy are. comfortable. I wise mind, so I don't know some version of that right later. i'm not being very articulate at the moment, but some version of."
16691.0,Patient,Oh here's. my mind goes directly to. walking the middle ground or like i'll use wise mind.
416.0,Provider,"yeah whatever works best whenever it doesn't trigger 1000 other thoughts that then distract you right. it's like. We want it to resonate like the sound of a beautiful. You know, a singing bowl or something like that beautiful sound we want it to be something that resonates throughout your body but doesn't like send your mind off to question it in a million ways so."
16691.0,Patient,middle of the road sounds like loser to me.
416.0,Provider,Okay yeah no we're not doing anything sounds like loser.
16691.0,Patient,Why do Why is why. My smile yeah.
416.0,Provider,yeah what's wrong what's wrong with my district.
16691.0,Patient,yeah okay i'm using my wife's mind.
416.0,Provider,"There is a. section in the book. Also, so this is like mindfulness hand out seven."
16691.0,Patient,Okay.
416.0,Provider,"And and. It talks about why is mine from a spiritual perspective I don't always do this with people, but I think for you, since you already have. you're fighting."
16691.0,Patient,With spiritual okay.
416.0,Provider,"I think this might. might be a good one for you to kind of contemplate a little bit. And I don't know, do you ever do loving kindness meditation."
16691.0,Patient,Now. Just my face Why did I have such a reaction to that like.
416.0,Provider,The one i'm.
16691.0,Patient,Thinking love.
