So that's my next step there but. she's the most why don't we just get you a new one, I said I can't afford a new car she said I didn't ask you what you can afford style I kind of feel like.

I said, you have no family time all you do is work work work work so during that time with your husband. She said I know she said, but we can't let the business go she said, people are just not wanting to work right now I said I realized that.

207.0,Provider,So um. You know I think it's also male pride there eagle all of that event was.
9865.0,Patient,Definitely.
207.0,Provider,A lot of that is involved with the fact that they.
9865.0,Patient,yeah his sister wouldn't even come help him with his mom it was all on him.
207.0,Provider,mean it's just a cool.
9865.0,Patient,"yeah yeah and then he was in a robot motorcycle wreck two weeks before she died and is the girl, he was seeing then died and. It was like two weeks in homage to the minute and when his girlfriend died when his mom died two weeks later. yeah. Is he came down from Michigan was trying to take care of him and his mom. I went down. In La for. awful his mom died of cancer. And he couldn't even hardly move, he was in some kind of a big contraption dizzy bones and he's back and he's at a big thing on his arm and thing on his neck, and he was beat up pretty bad. Some woman can run on a motorcycle that she was in a big pickup truck."
207.0,Provider,"Oh wow. So he's been for a laptop I mean, so you would you say that. Is it, or should I say, is it fair to say that a lot of your shift comes from just kind of watching how much he. Ultimately, possibly be deteriorating, but just not admitting."
9865.0,Patient,"No, I used to let all that stress me out but. I don't know, in the last five or six months i've really turned over a new leaf when it comes to all that. i'm not letting people dragging me down like I did. I had a girl show up here at the House yesterday that I haven't seen in over a year, she went to my youngest daughter's house beating on her door. And Amor wasn't sure who it was she didn't let her in didn't even answer and she's got one of those doorbell camera things when she showed up here by senior getting out of the car and I stood there and I thought I don't even know if I want to open this door knock. In the. door I said, what do you want, she said, well, I said why don't think we parted on good terms over a year ago I said not not heard nothing from you. And she said, I need a favor I said, what do you mean you need a favor I said, apparently, I figured you needed something or you wouldn't be here. well. i'm back on my hand but my son not my problem, she said, I need a supplier. is to grow it's been over four years, and you know that she said well that's not what I heard, I said I don't give a damn once you've heard. I said, if I ever lied to you, she said, not that I know of I said Okay, she said, you can still hit me up with somebody. I said I don't know, nobody I don't want to know, nobody I said I just told you it's been over four years I said don't you think maybe if i'm trying to hook you up that would make me want to use again. Well, why would it. Why would I said, you know what that still shows me that you have no respect for me, I said, you need to get in your car and get out of here because i'm not dealing with you so go don't come back."

207.0,Provider,"wow yeah I mean she's probably just young and you know the life that she's been you know it's it's keeping her kind of. it's keeping her. You know. Not committed, but you know just stuck in traffic that's what i'm looking for kind of life and all. Her mom."
9865.0,Patient,"Her to this. or mom took her to this man's house and dropped her off and said, this is your dad need stay here with him for a couple weeks and i'll be back to get you almost a year went by the man wasn't even her bad.

And there's only one of them that turned out to be halfway decent that's not on drugs and that's not out feeling and. Robin people."
207.0,Provider,"wow. You know that is a that is a lot that is a lot, and she her you know I I you know I always try to use, you know, for you yourself. When you see someone who is kind of still kind of trapped in that life and having such a hard time coming, away from that life, you know, does that give you hope and encouragement and motivation to continue on the path that you're on."
9865.0,Patient,"Yes, yes, definitely. Thinking about going back to school and getting my certification. Because I got an associate's mmm drug and alcohol counseling. Human services in corrections. Think i'd like to go ahead with my counseling. When I started, I wanted to work with kids abused kids and. I got a job at children, services and I couldn't do it. And then I started working with the developmentally disabled kids and that was hard to because I had one that was physically and sexually abused as a newborn baby and the man never paid for it."
207.0,Provider,A newborn baby and that. There was no consequence so at no charge.
9865.0,Patient,"No, they could never prove who it was. And that same man mess with my oldest grandson on on the Internet and. Like all the law on him and had them come down and look at all the stuff that was said during chats and. That COP to my grandson that he done the wrong thing he was saying, the wrong things to that man, I said he's a child, I said that man was wrong not him I. said he's a 55 year old perv out here, trying to get him a little boy don't tell my grandson he did something wrong, he did right but coming to us and telling us about all this don't discourage him I was mad. He said that he was under investigation, but they still never caught that man for anything."
207.0,Provider,But then when was the moment.
9865.0,Patient,"in and out. She was leaving that baby with him a while a lot and they ended up taking the little girl and put her in foster care. And this woman had her for a long time, and she got sick and couldn't take care anymore so grandma and grandpa tipper your mom got sick and grandpa was trying to take care of grandma and a little girl. She had cerebral palsy and. severe mental retardation. which she wasn't born with that. Step dad put her in a dryer and turned it on because you link with Ryan. Somebody put her in a dryer. yeah. But I had worked with that same little girl, when I was at children service that she was about to then, and when I went to work with the county doing my provider work she was one of the first people that I took on as a client she was eight then. So I did respite on the weekends and had her sometimes during the week for a few hours and grandpa get a break. she's like probably 22 now 21 or 22 years old. And she didn't when we got her, she didn't walk she didn't talk she didn't need to do anything like that they took veteran she was still in diapers with john thinks you ever come out of those. But by the time I quit working with her, she was probably saying 30 or 40 some words, some of them were inappropriate, but we didn't care, she was saying them. favorite word's was shit and."
207.0,Provider,How.
9865.0,Patient,"She was probably eight, when I picked her back up. yeah. And I think my grandson pulled her along too, because he was just little learning to talk and walking so she was you know watching him. He she called megan mama. She got that from donovan."
207.0,Provider,you're right.
9865.0,Patient,yeah yeah that's the oldest one.

9865.0,Patient,"yeah I was seeing so many other doctors that she said she just she knew I was on overload when it comes to doctors and she was going to handle that until she felt like she there couldn't or we weeded out some of the other ones, and then got me unemployment. I think at first there, I was seeing like six or seven different doctors. Think i'm down to three or four now."
207.0,Provider,"Okay Okay, because you see different specialists."
9865.0,Patient,let's still gotta go have a sleep study done and. see a neurologist.
207.0,Provider,When are you going to go to the point funny.
9865.0,Patient,"I don't know, I was scheduled once and when the woman wasn't very nice and. I figured it was best if I just walked away. She put me she told me to set put me in a room and she said i'll be back in just a few minutes to hours went by and she finally came back and she said i'm sorry I forgot the to remain in here she said, my life is just a mess right now and she's. In a she said i'm about to lose my home and and I said, well, what are we doing that, where do we go from here. And I said, can I go outside and smoke, she said no you're not allowed to leave the building, I said that is not what they told me. And she said no, you can't leave until it's time to go in the morning, I said i'm not going to have that and she just turned into. A queen bit, and I said, this is not gonna work out has said, for one, when I go to sleep somebody wakes me up a very nice cuz i'm a different person when I first wake up. And she just she was nasty I said tell you what I said i'm gonna check out and i'll get home my doctor, they can either send me somewhere else, or we just want to have a sleep study done. She said that's a real mature ag attitude to have about all this. is nice shut up i'm out of here."
207.0,Provider,"me. Oh, I did review. The only thing I would say so, so that you can stay on the every two weeks for everything on Judy is just to try to get your blood work done. And it seems like everything else you have. back when I met your into your into. Your day."
9865.0,Patient,"Today or tomorrow, suicide and get that cup out of my car."
207.0,Provider,"yeah right now that's, the only thing that will be. Holding you back is just getting back here hearing your screen down and then, once you speak to them just letting them know because it is on there for every two weeks so yeah you're right you shouldn't, be they shouldn't be putting you down for. Having missed anything. Okay. Oh yeah definitely try to. As soon as you can get on and if it is it's in your cart now is it that, like one of your branches to go in your car to get it."
9865.0,Patient,to one of my kids we mean.

207.0,Provider,"Okay okay yeah So if you can try to get that around for you can get it, for there somewhere, I think that will be. good for you, so that I know. I failed was he's on vacation last week so he'll be back next week. So if you can just get those things completed, then you should be fine and you will be able to stay on track with your own medication refill and it won't you shouldn't get bridge. Because right now that's just. it's, just as the only thing that's creating. The ad a compliant this medication i'm in the urine drug screen and but everything else is fine, you already have your appointment for the next two weeks scheduled."
