And then. you'd mentioned that i'd missed the meetings when my brother passed away and I, and I said well that was that was months ago, and you said it was like in October, he actually passed away in September, then the meeting that I missed. I talked to the care navigator and got a list, so the meeting I missed was the last last one I miss with Sep tember 14th. And then the ones after that there was three in a row that were cancelled and you and I had talked about those. You had some Internet problems and."

2428.0,Patient,yeah i'm not sure what happened on the seven.
214.0,Provider,"And in the seventh it's not clear, I think I had Internet issues, if I remember correctly, and then this one here is a human form that you can attend a group on November 10."
2428.0,Patient,yeah That was a basketball game.
214.0,Provider,yep yeah that's what it says.
2428.0,Patient,"i'm a manny. So during the summer I, the reason I you know when I started the program I was on the four o'clock with on Thursdays, but it was kind of messing up my work schedule, because you know you give more hours in the day in the summer. everything's kind of changed with the work, and I was, I was going to go back to the four o'clock there and. I was just wondering if it's alright with you that. I was going to ask if I could start working with chuck over there. I had i've had i've had talks with chuck he's a counselor."
214.0,Provider,"So what. What group, are you talking about on Thursdays."
2428.0,Patient,Oh it's a four o'clock. With chantel. i'm sorry it might be Tuesday.
214.0,Provider,"I hope, because I don't see nothing. Let me just check Tuesday now Tuesday Tuesday Tuesday. So it's Tuesday at four o'clock so you want to go back to four o'clock and you want to move. You want to go on charles's. schedule."
2428.0,Patient,"yeah i'd like to just get a kind of a fresh start because. Well yeah I just I think it makes sense if I move. The eight o'clock ones kind of late i'm usually pretty. Pretty i'm pretty spent usually by eight, so I think the four o'clock would be better for me and then i've actually i've talked with Charles or chuck. and Before when I started months ago and. I think if you don't mind i'd like to just do the account like see if how the counseling sessions go with him."
214.0,Provider,"yeah no problem I can take care of that i'm. going to see something here. yeah that's that's no problem so let's go back to the depression, though, is it just circumstance life life stressors and stuff like that."
2428.0,Patient,"well. i'm still taking those the shakes the ice appear trying to lose weight still but I mean it's those those have helped me lose a little bit of weight for sure, I appreciate that. um I guess. When that that incident with my brother. It really didn't help my relationships with my aunt and my brother my other brother and my dad because. His my brother's business partner, the one that died he claimed a chat owed him money and that's why he was keeping all chad's collection so basically I don't have even a T shirt that chat owns. And he had a my dad bought it hook line and sinker because my dad would go visit them at gun shows when they go to Reno because my dad's down there in sacramento. And they go out to dinner together, and you know Glenn can be real charming and stuff in the right circumstances but. So my dad he doesn't believe me that you know Chad didn't owe him any money and he thinks glenn's this great guy which you really isn't in my whole family knows that building, one that doesn't know that, as my dad but then. When I wanted to go up there to uh to help I wanted to be in his Room one last time and I knew Glenn and already gone through there and got anything of value. But Chad had some Old World War Two books and stuff that was his thing books that he used we used to look at together and he teach me without different kinds of metals and. tanks and all this and I asked my aunt I told her, I wanted to go up there, and help her because she said she was going to clean the room. And she denied my request you know so she went clean the room out and she said, oh don't worry i'll send you and your brother something, and she didn't send a squat and then. my brother other brother he got sent my brother's phone. and For months i've been trying to get my brother to send it to me because he can't unlock it. And I said well there's people that can unlock a phone you just got to take it to a computer person or something and then we can know a chad's last words were I mean we can know why didn't Glenn take him to the hospital because. He was staying on glenn's property and my aunt had to drive across the state line to pick him up like six days six days into his coven illness. And he couldn't eat he could barely walk to the car. And I just say, I want to know what his last words were like hey Glenn maybe I need to go to the hospital or. You know something, because I do still plan to confront Glenn. And i'd like to have all the information I possibly can, but my brother just keeps telling me oh i'll send it I forgot and I don't think he's ever going to send it I just. I don't know what the deal is but. there's that and then. The winter kind of brings me the financial problems I do lawn and home maintenance and painting, and then I sell stuff on eBay to try to survive, but. there's so many I was going to do the door dash and. there's so many people doing door dash that you can't even get an order. Right people have already got their people selected in this town that they want to use and you just can't even get an order at all. So so financially i'm having problems and. Just uh. I really like I told you, before I don't like my apartment I feel like there's a real bad energy here I can't find another place to live I keep moving my bed around all around the damn house trying to get a good night's sleep my my beds in the. In the dining room right now. it's in the dang dining room. Because yeah, I just wanted to see if that spot over there had like better energy, you know because. I mean just go falling trying to fall asleep is just a nightmare of the things that goes for my mind. It just I feel like i'm wrestling with just nonsense just just crazy stuff that does it has nothing to do with me or anything it's like my mind thinks about these things that don't make any sense at all. Just feels makes me feel like i'm losing my mind."
214.0,Provider,Alright well let's take.
2428.0,Patient,Time many don't worry because. You know I tried to i've tried suicide twice in my life and i'm not good at it so.
214.0,Provider,"I know. But if it's just asleep in all fairness, you should talk to Sean tell about that."
2428.0,Patient,"um well it's. Okay yeah. I mean, I have."
214.0,Provider,It it's a meditation.
2428.0,Patient,"yeah i've I probably tried every sleep medicine, there is, and I went really crazy one time on ambien That was the last suicide attempt. doctor the doctor took me off my regular sleep medicine and gave me ambien I found out later that that that that drug is banned in like 48 countries. And I went through this completely hysterical. It would it didn't work anymore and i'd lost maybe two or three days of sleep that I couldn't take him and I kept taking the medicine and maybe it helped me sleep for about a half hour an hour and then i'd wake up just wide awake but just in a whole crazy mindset and then. It got to the point where I felt like the World wasn't real and I felt like in nothing I did was real so I just tried to get out of it, I felt like it was a night like a nightmare, you know."
214.0,Provider,"Sure, I get that I get done."
2428.0,Patient,But I have to say yeah.
214.0,Provider,I was just say took the shuttle.
2428.0,Patient,"Because I haven't missed an episode like that, and like. That was five years ago, so, but I will."
214.0,Provider,"ask you to. ask him for some assistance, you know, in the interim i'm going to just confirm to change groups to Tuesday at 4pm and then I have to write, I have to write an email to my boss saying you know you'd like to go back and start working with chuck since he's already running that group."
2428.0,Patient,"Well, that and I have i've worked with them before and then. But yeah it's it's not a reflection on you, I actually think actually think you're very sincere, I think you really care about people and. If anything I just to be honest with you, I mean not to tell your boss, I guess, I could I could be a little intimidated by you a little bit."
214.0,Provider,that's fine.
2428.0,Patient,but not when we're talking like this.
214.0,Provider,"But just get I get it Aaron at the end of the day, you need to find a person that works best for you and yeah I do have an overwhelming. character, I get that a lot it's a good thing it's a bad thing it's a thing, but, for me, all I care about is you figuring out how this is going to benefit you and, if you think. they're going to chuck and benefit you, I want to support you I don't take it personal and I I even want to go out an extra mile and say hey that's really cool that you can be confident to tell me that because that's something. You should be able to have communication. and not take it personally right now."
2428.0,Patient,"yeah I think there's two types of people there's a there's motivators and Doers like I couldn't do your job, you know we we both know I couldn't do your job, and then there's people that are kind of passive and cowardly almost and the thing about it is. I I just. it's hard to explain, but I I completely respect you and I, like the way you. you're you're you've been strong and masculine doesn't stop you from being sincere and caring about people, I see that every group. I mean you genuinely really. care about everybody and everybody sees that and. I don't know I just I think like like I said just if i'm going to move to the four o'clock."
214.0,Provider,And then month.
2428.0,Patient,"I guess we've been through a lot like like from the beginning, we had a rough start with."
214.0,Provider,"Aaron it's fine and I thank you, but I I don't want you to lose that you, you have ultimately the right to say what you feel this other person not me. But if they get offended by what you tell them then they're not listening to what you're saying they don't care about how you feel I care how you feel. And I want all I want is for you to figure out to work on the things you want to work on so i'll write these emails don't worry about it. And you'll start getting a text to attend to Tuesday group I don't think that's going to happen tomorrow because it's quietly first to get this moving but i'll take care of the paperwork, on this side."
2428.0,Patient,"yeah I had waited weeks, I guess, to be honest to I probably was a little bit more. I let the thing bother me more than probably should have about when you said that my brother passed away in October, he when he passed away in September. I guess has been like it was it was kind of gnawing at me a little bit, but I know that was The thing is, I know that was just an honest mistake on your part that's nothing I should have you know I should have been worried about everything, but. I guess, I was worried about it because. I always think the worst like i'm barely hanging on in this program."
214.0,Provider,And hanging on like.
2428.0,Patient,"I feel like I, at any minute you know they could tell me hey you're out of the program because you missed too many things and."
214.0,Provider,"stuff that's not gonna happen every you're doing wonderful, please, I give you my sincere thoughts my professional suggestions you're doing wonderful there's nothing that indicates you're going to be put on a discharge nothing so and again."
2428.0,Patient,"nervous when you said that because. Because I know we'd went over it about those the ones we canceled meeting and I had thought I thought you had made some notes about. You know I thought you'd made some real particular notes, but during that group, you probably didn't really have time to really look at the notes that I should have probably considered that but."
214.0,Provider,"it's Okay, but it's Okay, I mean."
2428.0,Patient,"It made me a little nervous, I just want to be real, honest and straight with."
214.0,Provider,"You, I appreciate your honesty. And I appreciate that you're able to tell me that. And let me tell you."
2428.0,Patient,"What i'm talking to you now, I feel I feel a little a little regret insane goodbye."
214.0,Provider,it's never goodbye. Right it's never goodbye you're just going to take a different bus and the bus on one below.
