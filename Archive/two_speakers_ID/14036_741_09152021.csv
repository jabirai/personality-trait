14036.0,Patient,"Learning some. there's some programs courses that are they're kind of well known in the industry, they wouldn't say they're like educationally accredited, but a lot of companies are looking for more people that know how to do the thing instead of a piece of paper that says they just went to school."
741.0,Provider,Right.
14036.0,Patient,"it's kind of like a trade in itself. and, hopefully, you know i'll get enough knowledge to show a company that I can do the work and do it well, and that will be a more stable income, while i'm working on all that other entrepreneurial stuff on the side."

14036.0,Patient,"started exercising every day, and you know, working on meditating more each day and learning music theory better gotten a guitar again so that's good always enjoyed that. is working on a. You know, fulfilling myself physically."
741.0,Provider,"All right, so you're doing exercise you're doing meditation and you're doing your meditation at least once a day. Okay. And you're relaxing with music and learning right. Okay, have you tried any relaxation techniques like breathing or any of that stuff."

741.0,Provider,"Okay. All right, so on your exercise how How long are you exercising every day."
14036.0,Patient,"i'm increasing the amount of exercises I do each day like I started with. Things like two weeks ago, I was starting with just 20 push ups and 20 squats and now i'm up to 60 push ups squats and sit ups and then I tried to do my little pull up bar on the door frame that I get bumped up to like five now."
741.0,Provider,Have you tried any aerobic exercise like walking or anything like that.
14036.0,Patient,I definitely need to get the Cardio going good jump rope and some running.
741.0,Provider,"yeah something along that line just just to get those endorphins going and that strength training is good for your body, but it won't kick in those endorphins the way your Cardio and aerobic exercise will. Like Okay, so the next thing is, are you going to group."
14036.0,Patient,"No. decided this is is kind of an individual journey for me. I just haven't been a people person really ever it's, not that I dislike people it's just a. I like people when I needed to be around."
741.0,Provider,Okay.
14036.0,Patient,Most the time i'm just focusing on things that I need to do.
741.0,Provider,"Right right, unfortunately, we live in community."
14036.0,Patient,Right.
741.0,Provider,"And one of the things as addicts, we tend to do is we tend to not know how to have relationships and living community. Right um so one of the good things about recovery as that we can utilize the expanse of other people. It also means that we had to deal with other people's garbage. Which is probably part of your objection to dealing with people. yeah i'm assuming."
14036.0,Patient,"i've definitely been trying to ingratiate and endear myself to the people in this Community that have been in a lot of older folks live around this neighborhood. Just you know talking to them, because I do really want to you know help out more people, the further along I go it's definitely not going to be a just me type of project going forward. But i'm definitely trying to get a. Healthy relationships with healthy people, and I feel as though strengthen the resolve to want to stay there, instead of going back to what was. A lot of friends who are in recovery, too, so I. Have people to talk to you about these types of situations to people who understand."
741.0,Provider,"Okay um. I just want to suggest that you start attending once a week as a support group whether it's online. or in person, and I did doesn't really matter and what what type of support group, it is like whether it's smart recovery or celebrate recovery or a or whatever it is along that line i'm i'm not particular just so that you have a support group and can start focusing on. taking steps for change. Okay, so I know you said you got some some Maybe you can get your friends together, who are in recovery to put together our support group, whatever it takes okay."
14036.0,Patient,"Right, I have one he keeps sending me links to his smart group, like they have zoom meetings."
741.0,Provider,"check it out just see if it's something that you can get into if not try a different one there are so many out there that surely you're connect with somebody somewhere. Okay, so just. once a week that's all Okay, when I got into recovery they told me 90 meetings in 90 days and that's what I did. Today they don't they don't necessarily push that fact. Although I don't know why the garden clean if I hadn't done 90 meetings in 90 days so. Right um. But i'm not going to ask you to do anything that I haven't already done okay um. I am sober 15 years. So. it's not like I haven't been there and done that. and Alright, so. I guess i'm gonna have to go back and see if I can find your arm bio psychosocial so that I can figure out what we really need to work on together. Because at this point I didn't find it when I was looking when I got your appointment I hadn't found it yet. So I might have to go back and look for it."
14036.0,Patient,it's a part of the intake process.
741.0,Provider,"yeah it's probably that one time, when you saw therapists that they asked you a whole bunch of personal questions. right they got all up in your business and you were like, why are you asking me all this stuff. yeah that's um. Because that will tell me what you and I need to work on late, do you have um relationship problems with mom bad brothers and sisters. I don't know, do you."
14036.0,Patient,Know definitely not that.
741.0,Provider,Okay. hey look live with. Your grandma OK. OK. So those are important things I would have much preferred to have done your bio psychosocial so I know where we're at. Because now I get to ask you a bunch of the same stupid questions right. um. So tell me about your family.
