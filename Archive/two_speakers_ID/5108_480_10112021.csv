Still, a business it's."
5108.0,Patient,Oh sorry go ahead.
480.0,Provider,"I was just gonna say it's good to hear from people like you, because that's The thing is, people that are compliant with the program and figure it out.

480.0,Provider,"best way to deal with those type of people. Though so I have recently learned that every time i'm around especially it especially applies to like. The super Christian rigid. Type right. So. A lot of the comments and judgments. come from their own fear and anxiety. So a lot of times when they say things that are meant to make other people uncomfortable I just remind myself i'm like oh that's her own fear I don't need to buy into that bs. You know, and then it makes me feel better because it makes me feel like well a that's an objective reality that it is coming from her own anxiety and. Be it's not personal you know, like we try to make everything personal when her judgment towards you has nothing to do with you or your actions it's all about her anxiety and her fear."

What are they doing so, we get watching them and then the guy Daniels I was shocked and it starts pulling out all a special stuff. i'm like he's not going out there is a section. Like there was literally. Probably three inches high for you, and it was bad it, you know it was good. For the night and. He gets out there, like just about to where we're fishing in the open, water and he went through. yeah."

480.0,Provider,So that's why I don't walk on. bodies of water that are.
5108.0,Patient,"frozen because that's like one of my biggest fears is getting trapped under ice and freezing cold water. So it's really kind of freaky because the it as it's making it, it sounds like it's breaking. Like it literally goes talk and make plays all the weird like groaning noises."
480.0,Provider,And terrify you when you're sitting out there.
5108.0,Patient,"No, because that's how you know, making. When you tear it. By hearing people call. Old old tale."
480.0,Provider,"Exactly, so I don't know if I believe the old tales like my irrational fear is telling me that there's no way that the popping sound is making ice that's actually the ice breaking."
5108.0,Patient,i've gotten used to. It when I wait all year or.
480.0,Provider,Let me guess if you've never fallen in then maybe it might be partially true.
5108.0,Patient,"But i'll tell you a funny story. I was out on pawn called puffers con. With Monica brother and my old buddy my buddy next move back to New York. neck and justin drove a whole. But no, I have a portable a shack. And there's no Florida is huge stand on the ice underneath it and they drill the hole to the jig inside the inside the thing is I the chat.
