13735.0,Patient,um how are you.
480.0,Provider,"i'm good, how are you we missed you."
13735.0,Patient,"I know I keep missing I keep missing um we had Colbert in my house for like three weeks and I was just. So I couldn't get up I couldn't text like I I didn't have the energy to text, I can lift a finger, it was terrible like I never had."
480.0,Provider,"Was it that bad for you, oh no."
13735.0,Patient,"I have fibromyalgia. Oh, it was so intense like it was more of the body aches like I couldn't pick up my hands. I couldn't like just stuff like that."
480.0,Provider,"really bad back pain. Yes, yeah."
13735.0,Patient,"Yes, all of that a headache like just I felt like I was hung over. or like. i'm and i'm. Just everyone was sick, so I had to try and we were sick over the holidays, so it was the break, so we had a little break and then. My kids have still. They just went back this week."
480.0,Provider,"Oh, they just one."
13735.0,Patient,daughter my yeah they weren't able to go back until they either.
480.0,Provider,I said oh yeah cuz.
13735.0,Patient,test or. yeah so i'm like so like annoying. and
480.0,Provider,"So you were with. The kids for over a month straight because of the break and then Kobe. Yes, on a break oh wow."
13735.0,Patient,I almost went when I had my meds.
480.0,Provider,So that's important.
13735.0,Patient,I was okay um. And a lot of stuff happen um. I think my nephew moved out.
480.0,Provider,You think but don't know.
13735.0,Patient,"yeah because I keep asking him and he's got like he's not telling me but his room he took all most of his stuff. So. Because I kicked him out. and And I kind of don't feel guilty about it i'm saying kind of because. i'm. Because the real me would be like i'm worried about him and i'm worried about the relationship, but. I can't dwell on that, like, I tried to I tried to knock some sense into him and trying to be there for him and support him, but it wasn't working so and then just the disrespectful things that he said, and why why I told him he needs to leave and. I think that's valid enough for me to have kicked him out like there's no other way."
480.0,Provider,yeah oh for sure.
13735.0,Patient,So um. And I just i'm. So i'm just know cleaning out his room because he didn't clean his room is a mess or schooled in diapers under the bed and just just trying to. get it together and understand that i'm always going to be the bad guy so. To my sister and. And that's fine.
480.0,Provider,"Oh good and i'm glad you're okay with that because that's The thing is, when somebody has such a distorted perception of reality. they're never going to be able to see clearly their part and things and you're part of things right, so you just have to accept that she's not going to change her opinion or her mind on things, regardless of what's true or not. and not let it bother you, you know which is hard to not let it bother you but."
13735.0,Patient,"yeah but I had to like check myself, because I caught myself going into that that mindset so she sent me a message her son the younger, one that was I had to have her kids here. The old. And the younger one who's 16. Right so."
480.0,Provider,"He went in the older ones, the one that has the. Baby right, so it was actually three so it was her grandson to. Yes, yeah okay."
13735.0,Patient,"So he um he went to her house before like at the Kobe break like I mean the winter break for school. And he hasn't come back so he was supposed to go back to school last Monday and I asked her be is he going to come back to school or he started on Monday she's like no I don't think it's healthy for him to see you guys fighting all the time. And I just kind of like it triggered it triggered like you, are toxic, you are your House is unhealthy and my son is like this is unhealthy for him, so I felt like I felt like I had to defend myself. I did. I told her. I said no, I think you're right, I also think that he's not a good influence on my daughter who's nine years 10 years old, and he leaves papers and marijuana and stuff around in her room so. it's the best choice and also tell your older son that I might not be a good idea to leave guns locked and loaded. In the room and not tell me about them. And they're just unsupervised so."
480.0,Provider,that's not okay and it's not safe.
13735.0,Patient,You had a.
480.0,Provider,Little toddlers.
13735.0,Patient,"up, aside from her telling me what she felt was unhealthy i'm here telling her like No, this is unhealthy and don't throw it on me look within yourself. Right so um. And then, and then she went off telling me that that I wasn't. That. she's tried so hard to deal with my attitude and and that not just her, but everyone around me. And i'm like. Everyone around like I I heard that and it hurt me that she said that then when I heard it coming from my nephew this two days ago, and he said that's why no one wants to be around you. Now I see where it comes from, like."
480.0,Provider,it's from her. yeah yeah.
13735.0,Patient,"And i'm like wait, so if these people are saying they don't want to be around me in that that's why nobody wants to be around me, I have a lot of people I I had a choice, like you can go into depression, I believe this. load and just sit there and and like what's it called chemist chemist right is that a word."
480.0,Provider,that's the word.
13735.0,Patient,"Or you can fight those thoughts and just in see the reality, so the facts are, I have a lot of friends. And I have a lot of people that I have great relationships with and I started to name those people. And then I started to talk to this person consistently this person has never heard me i've never heard this person they understand me when i'm being assertive they they want me to speak up like these are people that loved me and value me. yeah and the people that are saying that oh i'm so hard to deal with is the same circle of her her husband and her kids. i'm like maybe that's the problem, maybe. they're a circle of people who probably have the same mindset which is they live together and they were raised together. And I am the oddball. And I do belong somewhere else and i'm okay with that, like want to be right there like i'm. And kind of like talking to myself as like like putting it in like very simple terms like just kind of helped me. helped me internalize that. Now, I think I don't know if I told you that this girl at my apartments."
480.0,Provider,"Yes, and. The COPs had to come and yeah. So what happened with that. Because that I talked to you like either that day or the next day."
13735.0,Patient,"Or the next day, and nothing happened I keep my distance and I don't go outside i'm. i'm if she's around that I just looked the other way or going my house or whatever. But because my nephew."
480.0,Provider,Had the gun.
13735.0,Patient,"He had the gun. Two days ago, the same day he left and didn't come home. and her cousin or whoever was around here in the apartments looking for me and looking for Isaac. He was trying to see who, who was the Who are these people that jumped her and pulled a gun out on her and and. They asked around and they said, well, it didn't go down like that, like she came to her doorstep and she pulled out some keys on her and tried to like she I have scars like on me now. Let me with her keys so. um but, so I text Isaac i'm like so you're gone you did this, you made this decision to pull out a gun and when you pull out a gun it's serious because someone else might want to do the same thing now you're. i'm here by myself with my kids. detected and now i'm just sitting here like thank you and. And he just doesn't doesn't text back doesn't like just ignore me and then someone else came and asked me Isaac was home because they owed him he owed the money so and i'm like okay now, I have to deal with that too yeah."
480.0,Provider,that's not fair to you at all.
13735.0,Patient,yeah and um. But. On a good know.
480.0,Provider,there's a good.
13735.0,Patient,"very, very good. Oh. I need to i'm. so excited i'm so excited i'm in love."
480.0,Provider,with him.
13735.0,Patient,"With the laundromat the guy from the longer, but I told you, I."
480.0,Provider,told me about the guy from the laundromat. Are you guys actually like dating or you just didn't love in your mind.
13735.0,Patient,don't worry thing.
480.0,Provider,Okay that's what.
13735.0,Patient,"it's um. Oh, my God I just. I just i'm just in love and he's in love and it just it's so different like I never like we met what three years ago. It feels the same way, like. it's just amazing and."
480.0,Provider,and healthy it's a healthy relationship.
13735.0,Patient,"Like and we can talk about things like we've talked about like emotions and expressing each other and it's like am I, being toxic and i'm like no you're just like we can say these things and. And my kids like him. believe, like my older one it's like I don't want you to get married I don't want you to be have a boyfriend um. But and he's willing to he's like i'm all do whatever it takes, you know to gain her trust to do these things. and I just feel like. it's such a good thing and he's so serious, and he has a great job and of us and he's like not selfish he's not egotistical he. Would he told me that, like 15 years ago, he was in a. portal. But that that's why he doesn't drink, because he feels like he he has that in his in the back of his mind so i'm like that is amazing because. I am an A and like I feel like that's something that's yeah like it's very like it's serious he's like no it's a great program like I applied that to to a lot of my situations like i'm not an alcoholic, but I just i've learned that I can be an alcoholic. If I don't do the right things. Right that's so like dope to me because. Like there's not a lot of people in my generation well he's older than me he's 39. But just his maturity level and, just like. How we've been through similar things it just be really like. It makes me forgive ruben. Like."
480.0,Provider,"forgive him how, though, like forgive with boundaries, though."
13735.0,Patient,yeah definitely.
480.0,Provider,Good okay.
13735.0,Patient,"Like I forgive you and I learned. And i'm done. Like and that it is closed Okay, and I. And i'm just like i'm so grateful like and, just like the way he is this. Is i'm. very humble."
480.0,Provider,I love that.
13735.0,Patient,"And I just like I just like him, I like."
480.0,Provider,"Well that's good because it does make it easier here's something that is challenging but. you're somebody who can handle challenges, so your first healthy relationship after toxic ones can be really hard because they trigger a lot of things right. But also it kind of forces you to heal and grow a lot faster because you're facing all those triggers, so I think if you have a person that you feel safe enough with it can be a really beautiful way to heal a lot of damage from past relationships. Not necessarily like throwing yourself into a codependent relationship, but you know, being able to do the world work on yourself with someone you know isn't going anywhere is safe isn't going to hurt you, you can trust him so i'm happy for you, I think that's awesome."
13735.0,Patient,"yeah and also he's kind of we went through similar things so it's kind of like we're both taking care of each other. Like if it was somebody else who hadn't gone through those things I don't think they would understand what i'm going through or be so patient with me and my kids or vice versa, if I wasn't if I hadn't gone through everything I would feel like entitled or whatever. And I just like there's so much honesty and transparency, like be the things that he was looking for in that or that he lacked in that relationship are the things that come naturally to me. So it's like it's amusing for him to see that he's like stone, but I can't believe, like that you don't go out and you stay home you take care of your kids and you're in school and you're. Like all these things that I do, because I do them and he just embraces that and i'm like I can't believe that you take your job serious like you love your job. Like I wanted ruben to take it serious like to put his household first like to be a well mannered man that's kind and humble and just things out, we were looking for in those people that are in each other so it's kind of like it's weird. But it's we said we're just we're just good right because it's different like it's."
480.0,Provider,it's new and.
13735.0,Patient,"So I just. The only challenge for me right now is my daughter like I don't want her to feel like i'm putting him first or i'm choosing to be in a relationship over her, but with time, I think, after she sees that he's the trustworthy person and that he's not hurting me I think she'll develop that. That trust."
480.0,Provider,"Oh for sure it might be helpful to to do like just little. date nights with her every once in a while so she knows that you still have that one on one time, and you really want to like invest in that relationship, because a lot of time it's one of two things either she's scared you're going to get hurt. or she's scared he's going to take you away from her meaning she's going to get less time so addressing both of those. would be easy to do in your situation because, like you said he's trustworthy inconsistent and loyal and going to prove to her over time that you're not going to get hurt. And then you can also do things to make her feel like she's special and and she still has a good bond with you, and that you know he's not going to replace her."
13735.0,Patient,yeah. yeah. And reuben paid $50 in child support which made me rich.
480.0,Provider,"Whole $50 way to go, Ruby. I mean better than nothing, but still that's like. Almost a joke."
13735.0,Patient,"yeah and his mom text me the same day, and she said they had gifts for my kids for Christmas and. Just like my kids have everything they need and want like they don't really need for anything and that was messy. and"
480.0,Provider,They didn't like that.
13735.0,Patient,"No, she said, I have material things but i'm knowing us is more important and that's not something that they can they can express themselves until they're older. And then I felt like just telling them a whole bunch of stuff like like where were you if you're so concerned, where were you. Like it's, not just on holidays like, so why would you bring up about gifts like what interest say hey how are you guys, can we come see them or."
480.0,Provider,"If it was really about OK, so the fact that she said to you, we have gifts for the kids is very manipulative because if she just wanted to give the kids gifts, you would have just mailed them to you, you know what I mean. Like she would have somehow found a way to send them so even that coming up, is a very manipulative way of her trying to feel like okay well I bought your kids a gift so now you owe me time with that."
13735.0,Patient,"So she said, we can drop them off or you can pick them up, and I said I just ignored the question I just said, thanks, but you know my kids don't need anything they have everything they need like they don't need extra toys clothes they don't need anything. As far as attention like they don't even ask for their dad like. The so it's it's not."
480.0,Provider,Which is very telling of his relationship with them if they don't even miss him very that speaks volumes.
13735.0,Patient,"yeah so. they're doing great without him not doing better like it's in three days away from my nephew and they're doing so much better. And it's just all these toxic. it's big it's me not setting boundaries I don't want to hurt the people that I love, so I let them show their unloving characteristics and I override them. yep so i'm just like Okay, I can love you. But I can also set boundaries."
480.0,Provider,"Yes, that is key. I can love you. And you don't have to hurt me in the process of me loving you."
13735.0,Patient,"So if someone's hurting me and i'm loving them it's like it's out of balance, I didn't see that I didn't see that."
480.0,Provider,"Well i'm super proud of you, because you made a lot of big life changes and healthy decisions and had coven so that's pretty impressive. Are you back in school how's that going."
13735.0,Patient,"um I start next week. Esther they just told me they're not exceeded my time limit for financial aid, so I have to write an appeal. that's fine."
480.0,Provider,Just one more thing you have to do.
13735.0,Patient,yeah which i'm procrastinating on.
480.0,Provider,don't feel good when you do it okay take long.
13735.0,Patient,yeah.
480.0,Provider,Like mostly self to because i'm procrastinating on things right now and i'm like just calm and.
13735.0,Patient,"yeah. Just. i'm excited for group tomorrow, I want to see everyone. And I. Hope you like like I. owe an ideal so he. He had cold if he could work and. That was crazy. He he was trying to take care of me having coded bringing stuff and then he got covered."
480.0,Provider,My internet's been a really choppy and then stable in it shifts cut out oh. Sorry Internet.
13735.0,Patient,"He said i'm i'm like he's like see what happens, no, I told him see what happens when you take care of me because you're being toxic."
480.0,Provider,yeah as far back. Let me love you.
13735.0,Patient,Let me take care of you knows like okay.
480.0,Provider,"that's exactly what you need. Someone the kids to show up and take care of you, and not let you push them away and. say no."
13735.0,Patient,"yeah. And my kids are like can you sleep over with us, can you be our dad."
480.0,Provider,oh dear.
13735.0,Patient,yay he's like i'm. You so like open to that because he has kids too and. he's like yeah i'll be your dad. And then. he's like we have to ask your mom first mommy can up your dad i'm just like not today. What day like when we're ready. So they're just like are you ready now like. And then. It just the older one she's just like so resistant but it's. I think it's easier for the little ones to understand. yeah um.
480.0,Provider,"Not necessarily easier for them to understand it's easier for them to. adapt adapt and live in the present right because there's not all that history and remembering what happened before that happens with younger kids so the whole point of like. finding ways to live in the present is because that's a really effective coping skill. So toddlers and kids naturally know how to do that because that's all they're focused on is the present so that's why a lot of times harm for them is minimized and they're much more resilient than adults, because they're able to live in the present more."
13735.0,Patient,that's interesting. So um. yeah that's that's true.
480.0,Provider,Well you're gonna come to group tomorrow and i'm excited. very excited.
13735.0,Patient,"I just hope that. We both said, we were going to try not to sabotage like self sabotage. And I think. just pointing out things that we we know like he tells me he tells me his weaknesses and he's vulnerable like he's. he's and that's so different to me because I didn't see that with ruben I didn't see his heart like I, and I wanted that like I wanted that intimacy I wanted that like bond and. It and now that I have it i'm like whoa like this is crazy, this is amazing like I can't believe i'm here so."
480.0,Provider,I can't wait for you to share this in group and give other people some hope. I love it.
13735.0,Patient,yeah.
480.0,Provider,"love it love it, this is big this is real big i'm happy for you."
13735.0,Patient,"And my brother said, my brother said. I called him and I said hey i'm going to Hawaii he's like 45 them away with like Oh, my friend who's like your friend that's a girl like you know my friend that's a guy. And he's like Okay, no, I told him we're going to Jamaica and he's like well you can't go to Jamaica because Jamaica this, and this is happening and blah blah blah so maybe you should go somewhere in the states as your first trip with this person and then. he's and then it was like okay i'll think about that he's like but I don't want you to call me and like asked me for permission like you don't have to ask me for permission like these are your decisions like you are. You know you make your decisions, and as long as they're good decisions, and you know i'll be happy to hear that. And, but you don't feel like i'm your dad or or like you're gonna make me mad or anything I was like well I just I just kind of wanted to. Like I didn't even know it's sick because he's ever said that to me, I felt like I always needed to live up to his standards, so I didn't know that that was being so much within me like he that to me told me like he trusts me."
480.0,Provider,"You trust you and he knows you make good decisions, otherwise he wouldn't say that to you."
13735.0,Patient,yeah so that was like really like. That was really empowering like really like eye opening.
480.0,Provider,"And it's fun to be really validating just knowing that you can trust. Our intuition, because your intuition, is leading you to make all these healthy decisions that other people are recognizing is healthy."
13735.0,Patient,But let my sister and her kids tell it.
480.0,Provider,"yeah and I made their side of the story, no thanks."
13735.0,Patient,"But. i'm. Like i'm Okay, right now, and the only thing that i'm like worried about is like because I do this, a lot um when things are good. I started to get really anxious like something that's going to happen and i'm on edge and then I start to worry and I loosely but I started to clean and I started to do everything."
480.0,Provider,"So those are you can do something different right So even if you get the anxious thoughts of. Something bad's going to happen that's just a thought that doesn't mean that thought is going to actually come true so. finding other ways to deal with your anxiety like okay so cleaning, I know, is a good one for you as long as you don't overdo it, and become OCD right. So cleaning can be a healthy outlet, if you do it in moderation and use it as a coping skill, instead of like a I need my house to look perfect because my life is going to fall apart. So that can be a good one, and then also even talking through your anxiety with your partner, because you have someone that is vulnerable, and you can trust like he can help with that a lot. Because that I think is a big part of it is this you're coming from such an unstable relationship and unsafe relationship that that's where that anxiety comes from is like this is too good to be true it's. gonna go away he's gonna leave. or it's a big."
13735.0,Patient,"Because I believed reuben this whole time and then I didn't know that he was not he was not who he was trying to beat so this almost happened to me today I almost had a panic attack and I. I was. Cleaning my room and I was putting all the sorting out clothes for the laundry and then I stopped it on like what if he just told me right now that he's like it's not working out for you. And then i'm just like oh my God like that would break my heart, like I would. Just cry like, but I would have to accept it and then i'm going along with like this scenario in my head, like all the things that i'm going to do, or that I would do if he said those words to me. yeah and then i'm like oh my God i'm going into this right now, like I like I can't change my what i'm thinking about and i'm just like. i'm like hey siri call mom and then called my mom and then she didn't answer and I was gonna freak out. Like okay like finish this close or like do something else, and like I was gonna panic so then he calls me and i'm like I don't want to answer because i'm going to panic and he's on the phone. Just like oh my God I can't do this like I can't be in a relationship, and I was like what are you doing to yourself, like this was so crazy."
480.0,Provider,"But that's not crazy that's what I mean by your first healthy relationship after an abusive one is hard because of this exact reason. Because of your anxiety and that's where, if you have someone it's okay to ask for reassurance it's okay to tell him I am scared to death you're just going to peace out one day. And he'll probably say that's not going to happen and reassure you, and then at least in that little bit of time if it's a day if it's a week you'll feel safe again and the relationship. So that's the thing you got to know it's okay to ask for reassurance because of what you've been through."
13735.0,Patient,"yeah. I told him like I just painted whole scenario, if my mind. And he's like what. And I told him and he's like so this whole time i'm sitting here working and i'm thinking about you. and How. Your did you eat it I put it in your. Thinking about what this whole scenario this whole like movie in your. brain and i'm sitting at work, waiting for you to call me because I don't want to bother you and you're just what are you doing knows like well I almost kind of and I didn't want you see me Peniche. yeah it was like but for what it like i'm here it's like i'm here i'm gonna be here, like, I want to be you like we. i'm scared that you're going to do that to me so he's like."
480.0,Provider,I love that you're talking about them.
13735.0,Patient,To each other. was like okay. gosh.
480.0,Provider,"I love it I love it okay i'm gonna let you go cuz my Internet starting to get really choppy it's freezing, like every Tuesday. i'll see you in the morning."
13735.0,Patient,i'll see you.
480.0,Provider,"All right, bye."
