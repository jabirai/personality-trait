14953.0,Patient,"i've been getting where I don't get real tired, but then on my mind will race and I can't fall asleep and then. Like my son came over Saturday I got it like I finally fell asleep at like five in the morning and then I. got up when he did, which was like a 10 or 11 so I thought i'd be so tired Sunday night Sunday night I still the same thing I only got about three hours three or four hours to sleep. Okay, last night I was so tired I lay down like nine or 10 and I still lay there a lot like I get a little bit of cramping kicks and stuff every now and then. And uh and i've just been nauseous and I just skip these very swings where I just feel really depressed and I guess, I was you still where if I get depressed I pick up and take some more credos so i'm not."
505.0,Provider,"used to just yeah exactly um. I give you a lot of credit, you need to give you a lot of credit, this is not easy. yeah so the other medicine that I gave you was clonidine Have you taken that."
14953.0,Patient,"I did the first night that I. Am on. A while I was on. My so yeah I still am on I forgot the one medicine, I forgot to mention it, I take is a for nightmares like from ptsd and I came in it's in a blood pressure type pill to. So I took the first night and then I thought I better talk to you before I again what's that."
505.0,Provider,yeah.
14953.0,Patient,"I can, I can think of the name, oh. prison."
505.0,Provider,"yeah yes excellent, what is the dose on that."
14953.0,Patient,one milligram.
505.0,Provider,"Okay, so that's a really good medicine in your instincts are right clonidine and present are very similar. So i'm like you're always in dose is probably pretty low right now. So I would say, do you take it every night."
14953.0,Patient,"Well, I if I go through a period where I don't have the nightmares is often I I kind of forget about it, but I was lately i've been taking it again every night. I was getting nightmares like every night just constantly and waking up and cold to itself, and what was going on, so I started taking them."
505.0,Provider,"To take two of them okay. Oh, because now that you're in withdraw your nightmares Hungary works. And this is a very safe medicine it's a blood pressure, medicine at one is he gets some more sleep, so I want to have them and it sounds like you're up enough so there was a movie at two milligrams um What about gabba penton are you taking that."
14953.0,Patient,"yeah I didn't. Have any got around to take it today, but I slept pretty late today, but I take it, I always take him when I go out shopping or something like I try to eat with it, and like and then take it like an hour before I go somewhere. Because helps with anxiety."
505.0,Provider,"sure why don't you take it more regularly right out because you're writing decided because it's gonna be bad because of the withdrawal. yeah, so I would recommend."
14953.0,Patient,"A certain time of day, like."
505.0,Provider,"yeah take. place today, if you have enough take it twice a day now my question to you is do you um. i'm thinking about her medication to help you sleep it's called Murray. And this is a medication that's very safe. And it's it's actually an Anti depressant if you ever."
14953.0,Patient,"Taken that before yeah yeah that's the one I can think oh sorry but i'm prescribed to that, too, I take a low dose of and I forgot to even tell you about it, I I do so I know exactly what is OK, I take a half. A half a fourth to a half of 15 milligrams at night but i've been prescribed in a while and that's the one I forgot to write down and even mentioned to you."
505.0,Provider,Okay that's all right um have you been taking out.
14953.0,Patient,"yeah I take a. Around the fourth to a half you I usually cut it in half, and then i'll cut the other half and half and take I just I was trying to quit taking because I heard it was bad on your can be bad in your liver, so I cut down from one to a half. No, but. i'm so worried about."
505.0,Provider,"My liver, I guess sure and that's fair and obviously you gotta get your primary care doctor and you have an MRI and all that. But free, you must sleep right now, as part of your withdrawal management, so I want to recommend to you that you take at least half of that merger tessa pain 15 normally I would have you on a full one. But I don't want you to take a quarter then not sleep then take another quarter because it's just not enough to be effective."
14953.0,Patient,"yeah. So okay. Well, I can do that so. Hopefully."
505.0,Provider,"So here's what we're gonna do we're gonna do is I will send you to a bomb the merchant has up to 15 milligrams you're going to take half of that and take it at the same time, every night, maybe 10 or 11 whatever works for you don't take the climate team."
14953.0,Patient,Oh okay.
505.0,Provider,Because you're exactly right it's very similar to the presentation. And then let's keep you on this suboxone. Okay.
14953.0,Patient,there's not any other flavors.
505.0,Provider,No. They don't know. it's it that's one of the downsides is it tastes lousy. Come on creative tastes terrible to.
