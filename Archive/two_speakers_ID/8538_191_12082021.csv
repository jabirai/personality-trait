191.0,Provider,Have you been using anything alcohol opioids. A first down or stimulants.
8538.0,Patient,No.
191.0,Provider,"No Okay, how is the harm reduction piece working for you, because that's all we're doing is harm reduction you're just saying man good medicine."
8538.0,Patient,"I mean, I like I like it, I don't I like it better than groups like I said I don't I don't enjoy group i'm sorry I not for me i've. You know one time, when I first got the long time ago, before I had my Marshall the six year old I had to do a group, and I was in group, for I was finishing off my probation. I had to do three years of probation one time, a long time ago and I completed. successfully completed it because I had to do group for like nine months and I just. I just don't. I don't know why I got back, I mean I know why I went back on suboxone later on in my life after that. But I just don't like I don't."
191.0,Provider,"Know what's different so what's different with you and our meeting individually as opposed to you. Because beforehand, we couldn't get you to really attend any individual appointments and i'm just trying to reflect the see. The difference with the harm reduction, what we're doing like you keep these."
8538.0,Patient,"I do, I may I just maybe I like the personal one on one. I don't feel like in therapy I don't want to do there be, I know I was part of my program and I need to do it, I had to I just I wasn't really I wasn't making an effort to it. And all that stuff I stayed you know, I was really I was busy a lot, too, and I was sick and I just wasn't in the mood for it, I don't know."
191.0,Provider,i'm just glad that you're safe now and you've got a healthy baby and we were able to walk with you. Through that then we're all happy about that.
8538.0,Patient,"Thank you, yes. I just wanted to know."
191.0,Provider,"Because I mean you've always been such an easy person to talk to and. Very communicative, I just wanted to know what was the difference between what we were trying to do with individual versus group versus what we're doing."
8538.0,Patient,And I and again like I just don't know what I can talk to them and in it and and. What do you say I know it doesn't matter about the rest of it. I guess I just don't know like I feel like maybe i'm a little head of my recovery. I don't want to sound conceited I don't. know.
191.0,Provider,What do I don't know I don't.
8538.0,Patient,"I just feel like I like is, I want to get off these things I do I want to, I want to soon taper down and get off i'm ready to get off of these i've been on them for what four years going on for years. Okay yeah i'm just i'm not."
191.0,Provider,"All right, so when you're ready. You know, when you when your life is more peaceful and you're feeling more stable, let me know."
8538.0,Patient,And we can look at doing a.
191.0,Provider,slight. A slow paper and very closely with you. I usually do recommend that you have a. therapist with. You have a relapse.
8538.0,Patient,Okay.
191.0,Provider,"And if we drop down a dose and you start having cravings and withdrawals, then we go back up to that prior dose and let you adjust longer so. That you are say because the main thing. Like so many working women life don't stop when you feel bad. You still have to work, you still have to take care of your children and sometimes that withdrawal in the middle of all that could just create a domino effect and mess things up okay. Well we'll follow closely and if something happens if you go down in love when you start feeling sick just go right back up to the one beforehand and."
8538.0,Patient,"Right, am I gonna. I mean I don't want to do it, yet I know. The two a day I just."
191.0,Provider,"Am I gonna be hands, it depends What we do know is that when you been on longer I would say, at least closer to two years, you know 18 months two years or so, from the research i've seen. And you start to taper is best to go down very slowly and longer intervals, for example, I had a patient who's a patient or like six milligrams and we went down to 5.5 milligrams we went down by half a milligram. She did really well she didn't really feel it Okay, then i've had patients, for whatever reason, work or family pressuring them. They wanted to go down from 16 at 12 and i've what i've noticed that most people going down by four milligrams is a lot. For some people going down by two they can feel it pay people will drop down by two milligrams and do fine and then also let people know you can drop down by one milligram that often requires switching you to the film, because you can cut those up."
8538.0,Patient,"yeah you. know, I was on them before which that makes sense because."
191.0,Provider,"yeah and and so like if you drop down what i'll tell people if you drop down our call my pitch, and I was doing by point five, we would decrease about every two weeks okay. Oh ma. In general, US i'd say, less lecture because your brain has to adjust. decrease see how you feel we do have some conference madison's take it one day at a time. Okay, then we meet and we say okay you're already at this at two to four weeks, do you think you can decrease by another half a milligram. And many times they're like yes, and then you decrease a little bit more, and we do it very slowly, they half a milligram and I know, Dr brill does that too, so I was speaking with her about it i've had fewer I felt that the person, the people that did it very slowly. You know. milligrams or less tolerated it better."
8538.0,Patient,"Okay, just all at once, I mean i've been a while, but I did what I did stop I stopped him before a long time ago. long time ago by myself. I mean. I was out of state and I couldn't get them anywhere else, so it was maybe in my mind at felt, you know what I mean I wasn't sick, as I. felt like I couldn't get him. But yeah i'll let you know when i'm ready to do that."
191.0,Provider,"Definitely, and then, when you're ready often like for people to do therapy continue to talk continue to meet. Have that accountability during that transition, and if you start getting cravings withdrawals if you start feeling like there's a chance to relapse just remember when you weighing down, you have no tolerance. So that means that if you go out and use heroin even a very, very low dose even a few sprinkles in its fentanyl it could kill you. Because tolerance is. is much lower angle and and that's where it gets really dangerous with a lot of patients, they come off they have low to no tolerance and they overdose and die, and you see that what a lot of people coming out of jail prison. they've been off the drugs they come out, they say Oh well, i'm i'll try the heroin and I used to use before will is no longer the same here or one that you use to use it could be a sprinkler fifth fentanyl then it. Even at a lower dose and it could kill you, and so you have to be very you know you have to be very cautious and always have a safety plan. have to have a safety plan okay. yeah yeah."
8538.0,Patient,"I don't know i've never been on fentanyl back, and when I was using there was the black tar heroin, so I don't know what yeah that's scary."
191.0,Provider,"i'm definitely see is this, even in the joints even in the. yeah and i've even had people i'm aware of people that didn't use and it got on them, you know. Around other people. And they passed out. So you be yeah you, you have to be very, very. cautious okay. yeah how are you doing emotionally any anger that we're going to do your review system any thoughts of plans of harming yourself or anyone else. Seeing or hearing anything that's not there."
8538.0,Patient,No.
