11679.0,Patient,This true.
386.0,Provider,"Perfect four out of four with 100% accuracy Malcolm fantastic for that I will go ahead and move forward here let's take a look. It looks like here the prescription recommendation it reads as is no showed appointment, the last 15 days, reduce the prescription to four days with the second prescription to bridge to next appointment. The drug screen is compliant so there's no need for that any changes for that, and then the reduced the prescription to four days per second prescription to bridge next appointment. Please instruct patient to schedule individual therapy and keep appointment or a whole replaced on the second bridge have do we have individual therapy scheduled."
11679.0,Patient,I don't think so no okay.
386.0,Provider,"Okay, so what i'm gonna do is i'm going to definitely get your prescription out for you, one way or another um so I have let's take a look your group assignment is on Thursdays. So what i'm a would be able to do is bridge for a four day supply with one additional refill just to get you over to next Thursday and. Were you trying to. we're trying to change your appointment times, or are you good with the thursday's."
11679.0,Patient,ago with their.
386.0,Provider,perspective.
11679.0,Patient,"Just overslept yesterday I got a new husband pain just was up all night, so I just."
386.0,Provider,"No worries already so what i'll do is a code in for four days supply with one additional refill and then I will keep you on the line, one doing that, with that way you know who I spoke with what pharmacist, I spoke with. And then, after we disconnect what I am recommending you do have peer support scheduled on the 10th. But what I would recommend because next if say this were to happen, ever again for a bridge if I don't have individual therapy scheduled and I wouldn't be able to call in the script until it is scheduled so. Because right now what we're doing the new protocol is to just bridge to the individual therapy appointment or whichever comes first and so. Just when when we're done here definitely log into the care navigation or the complaints vc and get scheduled for individual therapy to take place. Okay, OK. And then your uds. is right now greenlit we're good to go for that when you log in over there request for a new Cup to be sent out to you because it doesn't look like they've sent a new cup out yet. And it'll start marking your uds as non compliant on the 17th of September."
11679.0,Patient,Okay.
386.0,Provider,"Okay, and I so it's just I don't I just want, I want to give it time to get there to you that way, nothing can go back into like a prescription recommendation for you."
11679.0,Patient,yeah.
386.0,Provider,Request individual therapy. And are you currently out of medication altogether.
11679.0,Patient,"Yes, okay."
