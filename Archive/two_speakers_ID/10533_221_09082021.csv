221.0,Provider,"Good morning. Did you get up recently is this early for you or no. Yes, yes. yeah I know I hate making people get up early most people don't get up by now."
10533.0,Patient,Sorry i'm supposed to deal with it i'm pretty sure i'll never sleep again.
221.0,Provider,hey you signed up for this that's right yeah.
10533.0,Patient,good practice.
221.0,Provider,Right. How are you.
10533.0,Patient,"i'm doing very, very well, I have, I wanted to make this appointment, I want to talk to you about my Ob and my plan a little bit, and then I want to talk to you a little bit about options. So i'm going to women specialists of new Mexico and my specific midwife is going to be stephanie levy so Li ve y. And she seems just like really, really cool she probably won't be there when I deliver, but they have like a meet the midwife night and all the midwives are like feminists and cool. They have a anesthesiologist on staff who feels really comfortable giving me a spinal block. Because I don't have any lumbar problems, so that was really exciting to me I didn't know whether I was going to be able to do that or not."
221.0,Provider,that's great where are the problems in your back. In the store so.
10533.0,Patient,he's yeah it's all 26 to 2011. And I don't know because i've read difference to I should just stop I need to just shut off.
221.0,Provider,"You gotta stop looking at the Internet is toxic I tell you what it is so bad, there is. crap on there, and you just. Live your life in fear. Right no point it's not educational it's just harmful. Right you stop doing that, how can. You get away from that."
10533.0,Patient,"Well, I suppose I can find information more directly from the source is, instead, because they all this stuff on the Internet, about how. Any kind of fusion is going to make it hard for you to push and the cause increased pain and shoot she was I just talked to her like through text, but she was like oh yeah no problem we'll get it done. So I don't know you know who knows, I could have a C section, but for now everything is just looking really smooth and awesome oh and i've been able to stay off cigarettes as well, which is great."
221.0,Provider,"Oh, my God."
10533.0,Patient,Almost two weeks.
221.0,Provider,"Yes, tremendous. yeah well good for you i'm so proud of you, is it getting any easier, or is it still just really hard."
10533.0,Patient,"yeah i'm using the gum i'm an acupuncture helped a lot. Graham. And i'm just so exhausted all the time that it's that has honestly made it easier. I so that's everything that's going really well okay so So if I choose to stay with them, and I can give you their phone number, if you want for women specialists. Just let me know."
221.0,Provider,But i'll take if you haven't right there.
10533.0,Patient,"yeah it's 8436168 and i'm at the one on one Cole se they have one on jeffers into but i'm being seen at the one on the call. But all of them deliver it loveless women's and so yeah so that's kind of the first thing I want to talk about so. So loveless women's they are going, if I test positive for suboxone at. At like intake. they're not going to give me any support breastfeeding at all and they're not the way she described it stephanie was that they'd be like looking for reasons to put my baby in the nick you. And I just I get nervous about this stuff for a lot of different reasons. Like I think about you know I have anxiety, I know what I was like when I went to the hospital for my fusion and I don't take pain well and i'm kind of like an unpleasant person when this is going on. My partner's black and I he's amazing, but he is also a very unpleasant person to be around. I think about the kind of like discrimination, we could face, you know if I have if I, like my team like if I, like my midwife and i'm feeling really positive like the way she was making it seem like oh votto hospitals are going to have these policies. And I get there's things I can do like because a coven unfortunately if I want anybody to help me breastfeed I wouldn't be able to have like my partner with me stuff like that these are just things that i'm going to have to work out, and I have been talking to a lot of people. So just and i'm almost done and then i'll just. So. i've been talking to people I talked to a woman who's my acquaintance and she was using suboxone during her pregnancy until the third trimester because she was really concerned about miscarriage like me."
221.0,Provider,So i'm just gonna i'm just going to stop you and and and and point out that. I tend to say taking suboxone instead of using suboxone. just be the best language is.
10533.0,Patient,"Powerful No, it is so you shouldn't be saying using suboxone you're right and."
221.0,Provider,Other people say that they think you're using. So you're right taking suboxone it's a medication.
10533.0,Patient,And I.
221.0,Provider,Thought all.
10533.0,Patient,"Right important No, it is so important, when I first started using taking this a box, that I was saying stuff like. i'm gonna go get my shit and stuff and it's not helpful like it's. Nice disrespectful to me like it really. Is think it is. yeah um so yeah I i've heard of like crazy stuff of people getting off of it completely during the third trimester and that just sounds super fast to me, but I also i'm. Like just fetal I guess my number one concern is fetal development I like I know it's already 10 weeks I know my chance of miscarrying is low, but like I cannot mess up this baby so like. My fetal development is like my number one concern i'm also like. i've dealt with fatigue, since my fusion and it's been real bad and one of the reasons I didn't want to get on suboxone is because I knew that suboxone increased my fatigue and it does for sure um. I worry that once I deliver i'm not going to want to be like i'm not going to be able to be as tired as i've been. Before the pregnancy too so like from a personal side of things, I would like to eventually get down on my toes for energy levels. and, obviously, ideally, I would like to be able to get you know, support for breastfeeding, and not kind of like get. Discrimination that could put my baby in the Nikki and stuff like that, but i'm also like I guess what i'm asking are are their options were like what are my tapering options is it even realistic to be able to get off or not."
221.0,Provider,"realistic and smart or two different things. yeah, so I think it, it could potentially be realistic in a certain way, but I do not think it's smart. I think that staying stable on suboxone throughout the pregnancy is a really smart idea. Okay it's, the best thing for you and for your baby. Okay um I think that. I think that it's really important to investigate the reasons behind your desire to do that. And I think it's all stigma based. A part of it is fatigue."
10533.0,Patient,Maybe yeah yeah.
221.0,Provider,"But I think most of it is based in the stigma and the and the desire to be you know not taking this medicine, because of what other people think. And because of what other."
10533.0,Patient,realities of hospital administration. Reality yeah.
221.0,Provider,"it's it's reality, but it's also. stigma and you know, sometimes, sometimes we need to just stand up for ourselves, and just say this is the right thing and and. And I know that i'm right and i'm doing the right thing by my for myself and for my baby and your your policies are not in line with the science. I mean, there are a lot of policies that are not in line with the science and they need to change, and they have changed, and the only way that they're going to change fully to an acceptable level is if people stand up for themselves and don't you know cave to that."
10533.0,Patient,"I loved it because stephanie levy was like she was like if your baby is going through withdrawals, the best thing, for it is breastfeeding like it's so so. yeah."
221.0,Provider,Right so so. I am I am shocked actually.
10533.0,Patient,yeah.
221.0,Provider,"To hear you say that they will, so that what what won't they do, they won't allow you to breastfeed or they won't give. them the. corner they'll. Look at. mean jack what."
10533.0,Patient,"She said, they will not provide support for breastfeeding so they'll immediately give my baby formula and they won't, allow me to talk to any kind of coach or do nothing if I hire my own to live that's fine. But that means that I can't have my partner there."
221.0,Provider,is crazy.
10533.0,Patient,I know i'm gonna.
221.0,Provider,That is like totally behind the times. it's antiquated. it's not scientifically based breastfeeding is super important. In all babies. The only time that somebody should not breastfeed as if they have HIV.
10533.0,Patient,"Oh, really."
221.0,Provider,"Yes, it is absolutely indicated for for women to breastfeed. For all babies. Including babies, who are born to moms who are taking suboxone."
10533.0,Patient,"When it's crazy no question, because I know what kind of person when i'm nice I think i'm a nice, but I know what kind of person i'm gonna be when i'm in late. So this is helpful though i'm so and I think i'm going to look just look at other hospitals, if I have to give up women specialists and talk to somebody else to go to a hospital with better policies, I will. Because I just yeah I because I think like even if i'm doing really great isn't it just i'm on 16 is it just like I feel like, even if I go really slow my chances of being off 100% are pretty low."
221.0,Provider,"Extremely extremely low and you put yourself, you just add an extra stress on your system both emotionally and physically. Okay, and and there's no real reason for it."
10533.0,Patient,yeah.
221.0,Provider,"In my opinion, actually what we find you're not going to be happy to hear this is usually through the pregnancy, because of the increase metabolism, many women will have to go up on their dose to stay stable."
10533.0,Patient,Oh shit i'm actually glad you told me that no that was helpful.
221.0,Provider,"um. So Okay, if you compound that with tapering down on your dose and the increased metabolic demand that means that you're going to live. That you may possibly not for sure, but you you set yourself up for living in a state of kind of this underlying withdrawal all the time, which will not help your fatigue, which will not help your attitude which will you make you more cranky and and not be a good environment for baby."
10533.0,Patient,"or for your good point. yeah yeah he's in a bad environment already honestly with my hormones. I think, with um Okay, and I think. Again I got this from online, so this might not be correct, but I believe, when I was thinking about tapering before I got pregnant and. They were saying that like with chronic pain it's kind of tricky because you have to make sure that your pain doesn't increase too much. And they were saying that and I don't know if this is right or not, but they were saying, because, like the pain is like a sign of withdrawal. And you don't want your pain to get out of whack because it means that your body's going to withdraw is that the case like if we do to choose to taper at some point what am I going to be watching for what do I need to make sure I don't. Experience to me like I want to make sure that my feet as an upset you know, like like would even be the best signal of that."
221.0,Provider,"pain is probably not the best signal for that. Okay it's certainly a concern for you, because you have chronic pain, but they are kind of two different things. So the thing that you're most concerned about for baby is the withdrawal and so it's going to be typical withdrawal symptoms, whatever your most powerful ones are whether it's sweating or you know chicken skin or sneezing or watery. eyes or you know just kind of general emptiness and irritability and increased anxiety and all those things that you typically in the belly you know the diary and stuff."
10533.0,Patient,yeah all those things that you typically would get when you're going into withdrawal.
221.0,Provider,"Those are the things to focus in on. If you're getting it, you might be going into withdrawal and not only is that an issue for. If you're tapering but also like I say, as the pregnancy goes on your metabolism increases and sometimes your body kind of uses up the 16 milligrams quicker so those would be things for you to pay attention to. Going going forward like even though i'm still on 16 i'm just feeling withdrawal i'm feeling, you know all those things. yeah that might be an indication for us to kind of inch up a little bit on the dose Oh, those are things to still watch out for. Even if you're not tapering."
10533.0,Patient,i'm certainly happy were meeting this is. yeah because you know we can't do this in groups.
221.0,Provider,"This is. Like too detailed, to do right. yeah and personnel, you know it's just this is perfect and i'm happy to meet with you as often as you want to throughout the pregnancy. Things yeah, of course, but the other thing I wanted to say about that is. it's true that for patients who are on suboxone for opioid use disorder if they also have chronic pain, those are kind of two separate issues and thankfully the buprenorphine is a great medicine for both."
10533.0,Patient,It really.
221.0,Provider,"Is. So um. So, you know that is sort of another reason in the column of don't taper stay on it, because the last thing you want when you're miserable with all of the other pregnancy things. Not to say that you're miserable maybe you. are one of those people who, like feels like oh my God I love this. State Okay, so you know, to add that the flare up of chronic pain to that mix is you know not really in your best interest."
10533.0,Patient,"No that's that's super super helpful I know the way i've been taking it is um I think it before work and then like eight hours later, I take it after work, so I like the animal. to lead to kickbacks or whatever yeah. They just don't work by sleep but that's fine so that's fine that I take it that way right like."
221.0,Provider,No problem.
10533.0,Patient,"doesn't Okay, as long as i'm taking me to a day we're good."
221.0,Provider,"yeah so the pain is really separate from the withdrawal issue. So you can think of those separately, just because you're having pain in the middle of the night because the analgesia isn't lasting. is not a reason to think that the suboxone is not protecting your baby from withdrawal."
10533.0,Patient,"Okay, thank God okay that was."
221.0,Provider,So it's really it's really the withdrawal things that you're looking for just to gauge how babies doing. Babies not really affected by your pain directly.
10533.0,Patient,Great.
221.0,Provider,"You can read having pain and the baby's not feeling it. If you're having withdrawal babies feeling it. Oh, that is they're super helpful."
10533.0,Patient,"Okay, that was insanely helpful. Okay, thank you. Good if we do."
221.0,Provider,There was another thing I wanted to.
10533.0,Patient,say about.
221.0,Provider,"About chronic pain, so when you do decide to taper. off of the suboxone. You know, always a slow taper is good and probably not during pregnancy, but in the future so i'm making myself really clear I and i'm happy to do whatever you want, if you want to try to taper during pregnancy, we can talk about that again i'm strongly advise against it. loud and clear that's my that's my medical opinion don't taper during pregnancy, but if you when you do decide in the future to taper. And not everybody has to taper, but you are the sort of person, I know that you're going to want to taper or at least attempt to bring in the future and that's fine. The the one of the benefits of tapering when you're not pregnant is that you're going to have to deal with your chronic pain somehow and when you're not pregnant, you can take ibuprofen. And things like that."
10533.0,Patient,that's it.
221.0,Provider,"during pregnancy you can't so you have less tools to handle your chronic pain that may flare up when you do decide to taper. You can take ibuprofen you know once or twice a day for the pain that you're having whereas now you're kind of limited to tylenol and hot packs and you know the things that you can do physical stuff, but you have a little bit more. Access to tools when you're for the taper when you're not pregnant, then when you are pregnant."
10533.0,Patient,"That makes an absurd amount of sense, and I think my fatigue from the pregnancy is just so bad that like when I deliver i'm going to have an experience a pretty big lift from the fatigue anyway. So hopefully that will be enough like for me to deal. Because you're right because it's like and even when I have a newborn again that's not going to be an excellent time to taper either because that's like. Right most stressful time in people's entire lives right."
221.0,Provider,So I am i'm advocating for you to wait a year at least before thinking about tapering that's my that's my strong advice.
10533.0,Patient,Would there be a reason to consider dipping during the third trimester so to help my baby with withdrawal symptoms.
221.0,Provider,"No, because there's no there is not a direct correlation of the dose with neonatal. Withdrawal opioid withdrawal syndrome, there is not so, even if you were taking it, you know 24 milligrams or 32 milligrams. They did a study it's called the mom study and and it was a really powerful study and and one of the things that they checked base they tested kind of to. To their to steady questions one was not it's not the mom said it's the mother study mo Th er and you could look it up it's a cool study it was done, maybe. 2002 or something like that doesn't for know it's done 2006 something like that, so they tested they wanted to see at that point. buprenorphine was not really used in pregnancy, some people were using it, but it wasn't it was kind of just starting out and so methadone was was the recommended treatment because it's time tested everybody knows it works. Is that it was the treatment of choice for women who, with opioid use disorder, who were pregnant so so everyone was on methadone. And and very effective and they wanted to test, they did the study to see if taking buprenorphine was different than taking methadone for women who are pregnant. And what they found one of the things that they found is that, yes, it was a big difference. Which is why we've sort of converted to buprenorphine being the treatment of choice during pregnancy, although methadone is a perfectly reasonable treatment of choice, but there is an advantage of buprenorphine. Over methadone that they that the kiddos tended to have less neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome and for a shorter period of time. So they were out of the hospital sooner. than the folks who were on methadone so so that was a really landmark study and it was really important. And the other thing that they showed is that. I think it was in this study it may have been in a subsequent study that it didn't really matter the dose of either methadone or buprenorphine that did not determine the severity of the neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome so. We used to call it mass. A neonatal apnea syndrome, but now we call it now's neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome because it's not like they're abstinent abstinence implies. That the kiddo has a choice and that there."
10533.0,Patient,Tuesday
221.0,Provider,"Be abstinent or something like that so it's more georgie. yeah the neonatal abstinence syndrome, so the the more proper term is needed neonatal opioid withdrawal syndrome because it's a withdrawal from opiates. If there's no judgment there. anyways so that's a little bit of terminology i'm really into words."
10533.0,Patient,No that's helpful yeah.
221.0,Provider,"So, so there they showed that there is not a what what's called a dose response so it doesn't you could be on a small dose and have bad nows or you can be on a large dose and have hardly any now."
10533.0,Patient,"There was especially stressed out of my Labor goes bad that's not gonna do anything good for anybody so just like. The better i'm taking care of myself, technically, probably, the better the withdrawals when I go."
221.0,Provider,"Okay, exactly right. And it's not going to make any difference, so you know saying you're at. Say you're at 20 milligrams in your third trimester and you say yeah you know what i'm going to just go down, I want to get down to 12 milligrams before my baby's born because it's going to help it's not going to help it's just going to make you totally miserable going. yeah 2212 for no good reason, no good reason."
10533.0,Patient,"No that's that was absurdly helpful because I think there's all this pressure and it's so funny because, like. here's where. Well, and even women who have gone through this like have so much to say about it it's crazy."
221.0,Provider,"Like yes, and even in group it's like. yeah get down in the third in the third trimester I think Wendy was saying, and so. it's not based in science, it may have been your experience."
10533.0,Patient,Right.
221.0,Provider,"You know that it's it's it's it's like looking at the Internet. You know this is not right, this is not science based it's just based on someone's experience or what somebody has to say and yes that's their experience and that's totally valid, but for you to internalize that and think that that's that's true and real for you is not necessarily helpful."
10533.0,Patient,"You know that's certainly helpful um, so I think my biggest challenge, I was just going to be deciding which hospital, I want to go to and it's loveless. Once if I if I choose to go to loveless like is it sounds like they're good people like just because there's bad policies doesn't mean that will be bad people. I know you were saying that you can't remember."
221.0,Provider,"And there ya know i've had people who are happy with it, and if you check them out early and you and you investigate it. Maybe the policy is under review, or maybe changed recently, maybe you're speaking up and saying i'm with this midwife group, and I wanted to live with this hospital, but this is not okay with me. it's not based in science. And would you reconsider your policy and, if not i'm going somewhere else."
10533.0,Patient,I love that.
221.0,Provider,"Because you have power, as you know, a quote consumer and and just because you're more enlightened than they are doesn't mean that they, you know that they that you need to be treated that way they can they can revise their policies, policies are made to be changed."
10533.0,Patient,"Is it a good idea for me to start kind of preparing that my baby might do you put in the neck you like it when new, regardless of the hospital I choose."
221.0,Provider,For your for you to prepare mentally.
10533.0,Patient,yeah just because the.
221.0,Provider,"Sure, as I mean. it's it's a possibility. You know that the the risk of that is is is not super high, but there is a risk of that so you know just preparing for that, and knowing. You know, learning about nouns and what the signs are so that you can work with the nurses, when your babies are born. and see you know, like okay well you know they're really irritable they're you know they're crying in a weird way can you help me. Look at this, you know, so there are certain things that there'll be looking at, to see if if your kiddo is going through nows and if they do it doesn't necessarily mean they need to be in the nick you. Just need to be followed more closely, and one of the most important things with nows is to be with mom if at all possible. and yeah."
10533.0,Patient,Good great.
221.0,Provider,"yeah, but I would prepare emotionally just because you know you're. you're on a medication that. can have effects on your baby. short term it has short term effects so just during the nouns period just in the perinatal period, just like right around delivery it there has been absolutely no evidence that shows any long term. Effects from being on suboxone no learning disabilities, no physical sort of deficiencies or problems and. And and it's been it's been fairly well studied. And the. You know, it would be really great and ideal if you never had a problem with opioid use disorder. But you do. And so, if you look at your options being stable on suboxone is totally a world better than being being pregnant off of suboxone and either like. You know biting the bullet and being in all kinds of misery and having a baby inside you when you're miserable or returning to use, because those are your options right. yeah like if you're not on suboxone and you're not stable, what do you think. What do you think you would be like, if you are not stable on suboxone right now."
10533.0,Patient,"Well, you know I just I think if If I could just have it it's it's the problem with the opiates is just it's the brain right like you can't. Your brain like I remember when I got clean I get cleaned for months to and it's just like your brain is not right, and like. I remember, just like talking to my partner and just being like I understand that what is going through my mind, is not correct like you need time to like get it regrow and."
221.0,Provider,"And that amount of time is one to two years it's not a quick fix, as you know, you know. From experience. You could be you could be off of this substance, for you know weeks to months and you still your brain doesn't work right your brain is is it's not it's not okay. So so um. yeah I think you. I think you answered the question."
10533.0,Patient,"And just real quick like just like it's interesting because, like you notice like your brain like. quitting cigarettes was different, and I think it's cause like my brain is better than it used to be like because it's like addiction it's like addiction in general it's not just the opiates like. yeah it's how I think about things in general it's interesting, it is true and and thank God we have."
221.0,Provider,"buprenorphine because we actually have a medicine that helps the brain to be normal it normalizes the brain because there's because there's. I mean, as you have experienced if you stop using if you're if you are addicted to opiates and you stop using there's no talking yourself out of it, I mean, even after you get through the physical withdrawal, I mean there's certainly no talking yourself out of the physical withdrawal. But even after that. Your brain is not normal and and the suboxone normalizes the brain, I mean it's it's quite remarkable, and I wish we had medications like for methamphetamines which is. Why terrible horrible."
10533.0,Patient,I never used uppers but i'm just curious why can't you guys use Ritalin in a similar way is it because the abuse potential is too high.
221.0,Provider,With methamphetamines.
10533.0,Patient,yeah.
221.0,Provider,"You mean I they've done lots of studies, it just doesn't work. As well and I don't understand the. physiology as to why that doesn't work because it's a similar idea. Right, I think, but I do think that there is a higher addiction potential. But I think it also doesn't. It doesn't help as much with the craving and stuff like like like buprenorphine does. yeah it doesn't tamp that down."
10533.0,Patient,"As much interesting. yep cool well, I guess, I can be lucky feel positive about having that not being on the other side of things and."
221.0,Provider,"Yes, I mean you have you have so much going for you, Sarah you've done so well in the time that i've known you and. You know I just I just give you kudos for for writing this out and staying with it and I, my opinion is the last thing you want to do is is rock this boat, you know."
10533.0,Patient,yeah.
221.0,Provider,"you're in a good boat. You got a good. Sturdy. seafaring boat so stay in it and keep writing it, I mean I I, I think that you're doing really well and I think that you should, I think i'm proud of you for looking into all of this stuff and for educating yourself about it, because you are your biggest advocate."
10533.0,Patient,Right yeah totally.
221.0,Provider,And it sounds like you have a good midwife.
10533.0,Patient,And that's yeah good.
221.0,Provider,How many times have you seen her just once.
10533.0,Patient,Just once yeah.
221.0,Provider,yeah and so you're 10 weeks. yeah do you know your. due date.
10533.0,Patient,I figured it out about April 3 yeah.
221.0,Provider,Okay.
10533.0,Patient,"i'm getting married one day so there'll be able to. Okay, better on Monday."
221.0,Provider,yeah okay good so you're having an ultrasound. And you had an ultrasound or no.
10533.0,Patient,No yeah.
221.0,Provider,"yeah this will be your first option that's so cool that's exciting. that's exciting. Okay, so um. yeah if I. Have we ever emailed back and forth no I don't think."
10533.0,Patient,Something.
221.0,Provider,You know what's your email address.
10533.0,Patient,SA ra s n O w three zero@gmail.com.
221.0,Provider,"Okay, so if I find anything that I think might help you i'll just send you an email."
10533.0,Patient,Okay awesome thanks.
221.0,Provider,yeah um. How are you feeling about things.
10533.0,Patient,Actually really great that was absurdly helpful. Good I think it was really helpful to talk it out with somebody who is not like super reactive and projecting projecting all their own crowd do it.
221.0,Provider,"Right and yeah it's really it's gonna be really important for you to. kind of gauge that and then just kind of plug your ears. yeah. or just take things with a grain of salt, you can listen but. it's like their experiences, not your experience. Right and don't look on the Internet. When you have a question about these things ask your midwife asked me."
10533.0,Patient,that's okay.
221.0,Provider,"Who, you know who knows. Okay um. And I wanted to talk to you about another thing if that's okay i'm going to share my screen with you."
10533.0,Patient,sure.
221.0,Provider,"Let me see. Because. You know, I was telling you that I think you're doing really well and I just want you to kind of. internalize that. and understand what i'm talking about how do you feel like you're doing in the Program."
10533.0,Patient,"hey um yeah like not to be too corny or whatever, but I feel like there's a reason that my life is coming that i'm getting what I want you know, like the stuff is coming together because, like I deserve it now not completely, but like more than I used to get it."
221.0,Provider,"yeah well I argue that you didn't deserve or argue with your point that you didn't deserve it before, but I will agree with your point that you totally deserve it now not relative to before but. You know you. You are good things good things should be coming to you and you're going to be a great mom Thank you mm hmm okay. Oh, I want before I before I share my screen, I would just want to tell you the other thing. about your fatigue and your energy look. i'm just your pregnancy in general, I totally agree with you that I think focusing on your nutrition is going to be key. For both you and your baby, so you know, maybe the midwives have a nutritionist available, you might want to talk to them about that, but I think that nutrition is so terribly important in your well being."
10533.0,Patient,And you're like including. Like specifically like protein and and and vegetables are kind of like just what mostly.
221.0,Provider,"yeah you know I think I think mostly staying away from anything processed and having. That are that are natural, but you know I also think that that high quality proteins really important and fresh veggies is really important, so yeah I think you're on track with that."
10533.0,Patient,"Okay, great."
221.0,Provider,"Okay, so this is what i'm going to share with you, so this is this is part of your chart and it's your attendance report. So this is from when you started you started in."
10533.0,Patient,Night right.
221.0,Provider,It says.
10533.0,Patient,Mark yeah okay yeah.
221.0,Provider,"Okay, and you can see, this pretty well. Is it yeah. Okay, totally so yeah, so this is when you started the green means that it's just an appointment that you checked in for. hmm the the the. Red is a no show. huh the yellow is cancelled and it doesn't mean that you canceled it sometimes yeah. We schedule something and then we have to cancel it like last Tuesday we didn't have group, but they had already scheduled it, so I asked them to cancel it so so. This guy right here so cancel you know, there are lots of reasons for that, so the thing that we look for is greens and reds basically the blue means that pending appointment, so you haven't had these appointments yet. So we look at greens and reds so Greens is like great the showing up to their appointment if we see something like this with like mostly green it's like man. This person is doing the program they're doing great they're participating something some people will have like read read read read read read green. yeah good no so lots of reds you have to reds in here and it's been a long time since you had a no show since. This is June 18 so you've been doing great and and I think you know this intrinsically but there's something about looking at this and saying wow I actually am doing really well."
10533.0,Patient,knows that I have are.
221.0,Provider,"You are doing really well, so I wanted to review with you that you know how some people. almost everybody gets to seven days worth of meds. yeah some people if they have a lot of no shows or they've had a recent no show they'll get four days of meds. Right and. refill I think that happened to you twice when you had these no shows."
10533.0,Patient,yeah.
221.0,Provider,"And then you work your way back up to a week, so there is a way to work your way up to two weeks, and then three weeks and then four weeks of MED, so you don't have to go to the pharmacy as often. And so that's every four months so every 16 weeks. If you have, like all greens and you're doing everything you're getting your uds is in and you're doing all of your appointments and you're. You know if if you have to cancel an appointment that's okay. it's the know right you just don't, let us know that's the problem. But if you have to cancel that's fine. So that doesn't count against you so so four months from is. So in another month if you keep up with your greens and everything, then, then we can meet again, we can talk and we can, if you if you want to, and if you feel okay about it, you can. You can go to a two week script."
10533.0,Patient,"That just makes me, it makes me feel better to like accomplish things."
221.0,Provider,"yeah right it's you know it's it's sort of an acknowledgement that you know that you know you're doing really well so so there's that something to look forward to, and if I forget then just make an appointment with me and we'll talk about it. So sounds great mid mid October okay. and And so, for folks who are getting a longer script we still encourage people to come, every week to group just because group is helpful and. But you know so but that's up to you, you can come every two weeks, if you want to once you get on a two week script but many people will will come to group and. And just say I don't need a script this week, you know."
10533.0,Patient,i've been surprised by how helpful I find group I thought it would. be the least helpful part of treatment that it's actually funny.
221.0,Provider,"i'm glad to hear that yeah it's a it's it's a it's surprisingly good and Dominique is so good, and I just I just love the people who are in group and everybody helps each other out and. So yeah I think it's i'm glad you're finding it helpful."
10533.0,Patient,yeah definitely okay awesome. Good cool.
221.0,Provider,"All right, well anything else on your mind."
10533.0,Patient,that's it.
221.0,Provider,"Okay, good, so I will see you on Tuesday and go get him."
10533.0,Patient,And he.
221.0,Provider,did all the right things.
