To them, you know and that goes along with feeling accomplished also. You know, like if you've. finished your start, because I can multitask anything but. I have to finish it to feel like you did something you know what I mean."

462.0,Provider,Perfect okay that's good good um So what are your biggest struggles with it still.
15579.0,Patient,"Low just a he. I look at things from a very like. I don't explain, maybe yeah from all kinds of different angles so before you know, and my problem is that it goes really fast and usually I can respond in a quick way but. Sometimes i'm slow slower at that, because of the of you know, it can be any situation, and I say something, but some talking it out, but it could that's that's not my what I mean, so my opinion but it's you know it's just looking at things from a different. perspective, you know and that's I do, that a lot like I my mind works that way like i'll look at someone says something or present something i'll look at it 10 different angles, before I even you know and."
462.0,Provider,Did you feel like overthinking.
15579.0,Patient,"Oh yeah I do it's gotta be you know what I mean it has to. Be because. I mean, maybe not I don't know, but it does get you, it does get you a lot of different perspectives and you know, a different. You know in generalization of what you're you know what you're focusing on and wait so someone's thinking or saying you know. it's it's everyday situations like. This couple things, the only few things i'm really actually good at, and people was one of them, you know and. that's something I know you know and. Then you know, like just little problem solving. it's only two things I think i'm really actually good at. quick. But. Good things but they're good things, because you can elaborate and those will cover a long way."
462.0,Provider,"Okay, so you have a little bit of an overthinking challenge, but some of the things they're good at is like quick on your feet problem solving."
15579.0,Patient,yeah yeah I just it's. it's tiresome.
462.0,Provider,yeah that.
15579.0,Patient,Was that's what i'm saying why the medicine has actually started to like help my sleeping. Is I don't. yeah no I don't roll as fast. As my. You know my sleeping is like i've always had a hard time sleeping I have really. Really intense Greens like very real.
462.0,Provider,yeah please.
15579.0,Patient,"feel more in my dreams and I do, and you know now you know. You know I can I know i'm in there, and you know, for the most part, I know."
462.0,Provider,That can be really uncomfortable and even kind of scary. Very corrupted.
15579.0,Patient,"Tell me about it, I would rather, and I say this with shades of grey, I guess, but I would rather not. You know, remember, or whatever, because when you fall asleep and you're in a dream and my anxiety is so high in the dream, because I can't find their to suck you know I mean it's just."
462.0,Provider,Anything yeah.
15579.0,Patient,"And it's always it's like torture. And literally like it's like you're so you're so hollow home, you know and that feel and then you going through the stages of it, I can go like it's been like you know, a day or two and my dream and then wake up and it's only been like eight minutes."
462.0,Provider,gone by yeah okay.
15579.0,Patient,And then i'm then i'm fucking exhausted emotionally and. And that's that's what's happened there you know but it's. been helping like that's.
462.0,Provider,"But that's what anything and that's helped with this, so the medication is helping a little bit have you find anything else that's helpful."
15579.0,Patient,Oh just just you know. Not not trying to overthink.
462.0,Provider,"yeah so I was going to ask, do you have like a nighttime routine before bed, where you kind of wind down try not to look at the news look at your phone do some journaling. Let out some of those thoughts."
15579.0,Patient,"ya know I usually. Usually watch TV or for a little while, and you know something like that, and you know, think about figure out what you know you got to do in the morning and then pretty routine I guess. You know. I don't. I don't generally have a hard time falling asleep."
462.0,Provider,Staying.
15579.0,Patient,that's.
462.0,Provider,"fairly a regular routine to get to bed, but then, once you are asleep it's almost like you're tormented by your dreams, a little bit."
15579.0,Patient,"Oh, sometimes yes dreams thoughts whatever. Sometimes they're. Better. You know, but then you go to realize that it's me doing it to me."
462.0,Provider,"And so. What, how do you think you can help yourself with that a little bit."
15579.0,Patient,"Oh, you just gotta be more positives and you know, think about the good things when you're going to sleep. Instead of the road everything yeah. Because subconscious doesn't let you do that."
462.0,Provider,"No that's right no you don't necessarily have control of that but you're right, you can."
15579.0,Patient,"thing right little things that are around you stuff you do, you can change all that but what's there is there and it's stuff you don't even realize you catch you know. yeah I like I you know i'll see i'll remember something you know from weeks ago, you know just a flash i'm like oh yeah That was the guy that was sitting on the bench you know across from walgreens. You know, and just something like that. I have a. yeah have a memory that just a lot of things stick what people say what you see. You know."
462.0,Provider,Do you do you ever write things down or journal that can be kind of a good way to let let go of things and then even do like a little gratitude list before bed okay good So what do you use your journal for tell me what that.
15579.0,Patient,looks like. it's not really just notes. notes and quotes and thoughts.
462.0,Provider,that's good. Sometimes it. starts out and. yeah like I mean I do it like. frame it positively.
15579.0,Patient,"I do get to talk, I talked to I talked to my girlfriend you know we always before bed, you know it's always night, you know it's. You know how is the positive positive good night positive good morning. yeah that's very, very helpful it's you know what I mean it's literally like the best part you know of the day when you decide, you know that you're going to sleep, and you know that you're waking up and. You know when they get someone to talk to and. that's very helpful."
462.0,Provider,"Okay, so you feel supported you have that help there. So what are some of the goals that you'd like to work on overall in therapy and. You know just some things you'd like to challenge yourself on it could be related to add or sleep or just in life in general."
15579.0,Patient,"i'm. starting to. exercise more. stuff that you know, trying to trying to eat correctly, you know not correctly, but I have other issues with iron and too much with it it's different it's way too much iron not."
