11304.0,Patient,Oh definitely yeah so.
748.0,Provider,that's wonderful.
11304.0,Patient,"yeah it's a wonderful job you know I feel super lucky to be able to work there and I actually applied. 10 times before I got into it. wow yeah because I, I was in my early 20s and I was living in Los Angeles, and just kind of looking around for a job and everyone kept saying you know trader joes is a really good job they have really good benefits. And, like every time I would interview I would either bomb it or, I would like, I would like. They have like various screening processes, where they vet people so like really you get three interviews if you pass the third interview then you're in. But I would I would keep failing and failing and the more I failed, I was like what is it about trader joe's that is so, like selective like it just made me want to keep applying so anything yeah so eventually I got a good interview, and they really needed people and I got in. And i'm so happy that I made that decision because it's been I feel like. it's been the most financially comfortable i've ever been with this job you know I feel very just solid so. yeah it's definitely been a really good career."
748.0,Provider,"Oh that's wonderful, so why are you losing your health insurance, then."
11304.0,Patient,"Well, I, so I lived in Los Angeles for seven years and I survived the pandemic I got the hero pay they paid us extra money. and Well, however, the all of the challenging situations that Los Angeles already had became exacerbated by the pandemic, including. You know rent problems on housing people crime just everything got much worse, even though I was making more money. My whole living situation just kept feeling more and more dangerous I would walk outside and there'd be like heroin needles all over my front porch. there'd be people screaming and the night, you know I would walk out at midnight and try to like stop a fight between these two on house people who knows what they were doing. And it just got really intense, so what I decided to do was reach out to a family member who I get along with which is my grandmother and I suggested to her that I could live with her and help her. If she if she needed help, and so I did I moved up to northern California and i've kind of oriented my life around her so that I can help take a take care of her so she has. You know she has arthritis and she's in a really desperate financial situation right now so i'm kind of helping her in various ways, so, but basically what's ended ended up happening was I basically cut my hours significantly at trader joe's so I can help her."
748.0,Provider,and work there and maintain that connection. But right don't qualify for health insurance.
11304.0,Patient,yeah.
748.0,Provider,"that's that makes me my heart hurt. I know trader joe's is really committed to providing as best they can, for their employees, but there was a point at which it isn't about trader joe's it's a better system."
11304.0,Patient,Right yeah and.
748.0,Provider,"Here that you're really cognizant of all of that. yeah it sounds like you've got a huge heart, on top of seriously, that you would go outside to be supportive to people who are struggling and then housed and just the fact that you use that word. yeah now just. And yet you're probably might I don't know anything about you, yet one of the things about the way that I work is i'd much rather hear who you are from you then shirt. yeah so my way of getting to know you isn't to to look at me and the other thing is, when I do look at those I I end up forgetting, and then I meet the person. So you would strike me as someone who might have some ptsd. From earlier experiences."
11304.0,Patient,yeah yeah definitely very challenging childhood. and
748.0,Provider,you're getting it reinforced by being in that environment that you were in La.
11304.0,Patient,"In a way, yeah I mean. yeah I don't necessarily know that it was it was it was violent indirectly I don't know if I was. I don't know if I experienced. Though I was in a couple car accidents that was probably traumatizing too so."
748.0,Provider,witnessing. Secondary trauma triggers.
11304.0,Patient,"ptsd yeah. Definitely, so you know just the whole situation, but I feel so lucky to be able to be in this situation where i'm like totally immersed in nature and like. Every day i'm just like I can't believe i'm not in Los Angeles anymore I can't believe i'm surrounded by clean air, and you know just leaves blowing and no there's no one around and i'm just like it's it's so nourishing and rejuvenating to be here."
748.0,Provider,Are you.
11304.0,Patient,So i'm in the greater sacramento area i'm in a town called Cameron park. So it's in the Eldorado county. So it's very rural Sometimes I feel like i'm on a farm. So it's just. yeah I just feel super lucky to be here.
748.0,Provider,Great that's really great so How much longer do you think you have with bright heart.
11304.0,Patient,"i'm planning to be out of you know, take my exit some sometime in November."
748.0,Provider,"Oh, so I don't get much time with you at all."
11304.0,Patient,"No, unfortunately."
748.0,Provider,So what were you working on with Tara Tara Tara.
11304.0,Patient,Tara.
748.0,Provider,"And, and what would you like to work on and what feels like it's most present for you."
11304.0,Patient,"i'm. not really sure what I want to work on right now. I like to kind of just feel it out. yeah I was working on the ptsd with Tara we I learned a lot from her, and it was such a good thing. Maybe I can share with you, I recently. Was i'm influenced by the book, the power of now by eckhart totally so. A lot of the way I experienced my challenges is kind of through that kind of language, where some people say ptsd I say the pain body."
748.0,Provider,Okay.
11304.0,Patient,"um recently i've discovered that some of my triggers happen around food and also with if I perceive any type of antagonizing behavior from someone else like as if i'm experiencing like a bully or something like that so. But i've had a good experience recently i've. i've been reading the power of now, and sometimes i'll take classes with the car totally foundation and they talk about. Bringing your awareness to that ptsd to the body and just kind of observing it for an extended period of time, and recently. my grandmother, and I would get into an argument. I would notice that kind of my ptsd is kind of being triggered because i'm i'm overly hungry, or like i'm having eaten correct so i'm like kind of angry and. What i've done recently is i've kind of experimented and let myself kind of step into that angry mode but sit calmly, with it, and just watch it and what i've noticed is that. Now my hunger whenever that does arise it doesn't it's not as urgent, so I feel like i've added some healing to my my ptsd trigger. yeah so i'm like. Because like i'll turn into like a different person like if I because I do yard work for my grandmother, and like it's a lot of like physical activity shoveling and. raking and then you know if I haven't eaten and then something I get distracted and then she's wondering why i'm not cooking dinner, for her i'm like listen like I need to eat now like I."
748.0,Provider,Right right.
11304.0,Patient,"um so. But. i've just been amazed recently because. I think it has had a positive effect where i'll. Call it like a controlled discomfort or all i'll purposely put myself in a slightly uncomfortable position, but just observe it and just sit with it and. Then, when it actually arises in my day to day life i'm like oh it doesn't feel so dangerous and urgent as it arises."
748.0,Provider,So you're able to recognize that it doesn't have to control you. Right so it's a very challenging situation.
11304.0,Patient,"Right and then i've also noticed it i'll get a ptsd trigger from if I perceive that anyone is being antagonizing or aggressive or or bullying towards me. Like sometimes at work, I work with this person who you know they have this kind of machismo about them very you know domineering have a very domineering personality. But what i've learned in the past is that. When I lean into discomfort instead of shrinking away I gain back control so like I make. I. make a point every day to say hi to them first. And for some reason, it makes me feel very good and like back in power."
748.0,Provider,"Right, yes, probably. diminishes their experience of being able to overpower because. They can charge of the moment, in a very kind and compassionate way."
11304.0,Patient,Right right.
748.0,Provider,So passive way.
11304.0,Patient,"So I tried to wisdom. Thank you, I appreciate it, so I I kind of perceived these whoever i'm with who's a bit i'm perceiving to be a difficult person. I just pretend they're like an angel sent from hell to kind of challenge me."
748.0,Provider,An opportunity.
11304.0,Patient,"Right yeah. yeah it's like as if I created them or chose, I chose this path. To to have that challenge."
748.0,Provider,Oh wow that's beautiful. yeah so I like that that reframe that you've cultivated for yourself that you've created this situation to learn from it to grow and to heal.
11304.0,Patient,"Yes, absolutely."
748.0,Provider,As opposed to being victimized by it.
11304.0,Patient,"Right, so I. So far, in my experience of life, it seems like the most always the most challenging whether its financial troubles or physical health or difficult people it's usually difficult people who I really have to be alert with. Financial troubles and physical health aren't challenging to me as as challenging to me right now as difficult people. But I have been devastated, in the past by financial challenge which kind of contributed, from my perspective to kind of my spiritual awakening and that's kind of how I. became to learn about the Book of the power of now and accurate totally and stuff like that so that's when I started really. Totally shifted my perspective on life and my whole experience of life is totally different now. But yeah I when I moved to Los Angeles over seven years ago, I was a young 20 something had no idea what I was doing had no job no friends, I just all I knew is that my grand my grandfather's sister was willing to rent a room out to me and I just I worked for a basic grocery store there. But I also was kind of preyed upon by my bank they encouraged me to open two or three credit cards. And, and the next thing I know. i'm like 2425 and I have $15,000 in credit card debt and I was just like it devastated me I was like. It terrified me."
748.0,Provider,I was just like terrifying it controls this. Right in that situation.
11304.0,Patient,And by some of your process. right by some miracle i've paid it all off. and But I again I see it as like that was a strength training moment for me because I now I feel really free. yeah. yeah so I. Like I feel like I i'm wealthy very wealthy and rich and like I you know i'm very sensitive to my free time and. it's just amazing to have that freedom now.
748.0,Provider,So so deeply happy for you.
11304.0,Patient,Thank you.
748.0,Provider,"Wonderful sounds like you're very clear about the work that you do when you came to bright heart, what was the presenting reason. yeah me."
11304.0,Patient,"That was a missed a lot of chaos, with the pandemic and trying to get vaccinated and just kind of observing our collective life situation. or slightly before right heart, I was doing anti racist work. With this. With this group called white people for black lives and. wow they kind of they kind of helped. us observe the chaos and through a lens of anti racism and."
748.0,Provider,"And yet, taking advantage of backseat I don't know if you have you heard of the group now i'm not remembering what it's called starts with an s."
11304.0,Patient,showing up for Racial justice.
748.0,Provider,"Yes, exactly yeah yeah exactly I. I was a part of that, but it got a little bit too organized intellectual for me. I really hear the passion in your heart around issues like that."
11304.0,Patient,"yeah you know I. It was very rewarding I fully immerse myself in it and I I kind of spoke their language I learned how to speak their language and how to you know they have all these cutting edge ideas about race and gender and sexuality and things like that, so they. yeah I fully immerse myself in that for a long time well, not a long time, I would say, a few months before I got into bright heart."
748.0,Provider,But that does be a like a long time it's a good term because when you're immersed in it it's consuming and it's intense.
11304.0,Patient,"Right, it was very intense."
748.0,Provider,And it sounds like it was fresh like really alive.
11304.0,Patient,For you so was. yeah yeah. And so.
748.0,Provider,much important work i'm really I love hearing that that's. One of my biggest passions.
11304.0,Patient,"i'm so happy to hear that and. I learned a lot about organizing and what leadership means to me and. What you know what. What can organizing look like and so during that time. We had come across all different types of issues including trauma, so we were looking at how people can be traumatized and what what pain. Is and like you know the emotions around the work that we were doing and I came across a really intense article, for me, which was the CSA child sexual abuse and I started. I started looking at that issue through the lens of transformative justice and I guess that's a term that says that they go to the root of the issue. To kind of change the system from within, or whatever, but. I was realizing that I actually have experienced CSA and but. But not as intensely as one of my family members, as some of my other family members and. So I started having these questions i'm like well i'm i'm fully immersed in this cutting edge organization that wants to heal on a collective level, but I was like my intuition was telling me I need to heal on the personal level first so. So I. Why, I reached out to bright heart, and I was like I was shopping for therapists and I discovered reinhardt on on one of the websites and it just look really appealing and convincing to me and compelling so I I. reached out to them and they're like, so why are you here, and I was like well. I was watching this TV show called Rami it's a it's a hulu original series about this immigrant family who is learning how to kind of assimilate into America and stuff like that and. The the main character Rami these he's like me he's he's a young man living in the city he's single and he also happens to be watching a lot of Internet pornography. And some sometimes all watch Internet pornography and I realized that i'll have feelings of shame or guilt arise as i'm watching this and i'm i'm what i'm having questions about these feelings like is it bad to watching Internet pornography, you know and what does that say about me. As I was watching this show, and I would see him do that I would feel sorry for him. But since we're so alike. I was like Does that mean that I feel sorry for myself, so I kind of. I would kind of present that to shauntel and she's like she just simply said that it was a good question to be asking, and it was a good. reflection. And when I talked to Tara about it, she would say well. it's not it's not necessarily the judgment isn't necessary I think most of the pain that you're experiencing is from feelings of judgment but also we can go back and look at. The trauma that's happened to you and the trauma that you're that's happened to your family and through the lens of CSA and stuff like that so. So stuff that happened in the past, is a rising up now, in the present when my own sexual life. And so, like. We were looking at. yeah we were looking at my ptsd and. But we did some amazing work together we I I wrote a letter. To my family. addressing these issues where it was talking about, you know just coming forward with. The CSA that happened in my life and how that shows up in my own sexual life today. I never sent it to my to my family but I wrote it as if I was going to. Yes, and."
748.0,Provider,Yes. And you're the healing for yourself without. cultivating damage. or tree right or yes.
11304.0,Patient,"Right so. So now. Thank thankfully because of all the amazing work that i've done with bright heart, I don't have such dramatic feelings or ideas about my sexual life, you know, sometimes it arises, but I feel like it's less dramatic now and it's definitely saw i've softened on that issue a little bit."
748.0,Provider,Dramatic or dramatic.
11304.0,Patient,Dramatic with a D.
748.0,Provider,amp a run i'm not mama.
11304.0,Patient,yeah yeah so.
748.0,Provider,"It doesn't feel like watching Romney. you're able to recognize that you had compassion for him and. He could then have compassion for you, instead of judgment."
11304.0,Patient,"yeah definitely and I it took me a while to get to that. Because you know sexuality, people have different opinions on it another close friend of mine was saying that I should not be watching pornography, whereas most other people will say well. You know that it's hard to make a judgment call on sexual on on sexual topics like that, if you're not harming yourself or others. It doesn't necessarily you don't really have to make a judgment call on that. So. But yeah I just I kind of experience for myself that you know, do I accept myself for who, I am in this moment, regardless of what i'm doing and I often ask myself that now and i'll just sit there and i'll say yes, I do accept myself for whatever i'm going through and that kind of helps."
748.0,Provider,"that's wonderful yeah wonderful and has any of that kept you from or it doesn't promote and support you, having actual sexual relationships in your life with other people."
11304.0,Patient,"I well i'm a bit concerned about that because i've been single for quite some time, like maybe eight years I haven't had a real girlfriend a long time. In the past, when I did have a girlfriend for about two years. She did confront me when she discovered, I was watching pornography and asked me why I was watching pornography and I didn't really have a good answer, however, that was towards the end of the relationship. At the beginning and the middle I wasn't really interested in watching pornography, but I think, towards the end it's been a long time since that relationship. But I you know i've had you know various flings and things like that, but nothing serious okay. And, but i'm hopeful i'm hopeful, I feel I feel very open to a relationship, and I feel. I feel like i'm I think about it every day actually i'm thinking I don't want to feel like. A relationship is going to make my life better However I don't want to feel close to a relationship either to where i'm shutting people out, so I. People who are in my life I kind of think about you know, I wonder if we would make a good couple maybe I could take this person out to a picnic and get to know them I don't know. So. And people my age, I would expect, including women to kind of have shared experiences around Internet pornography like when I watch. TV, not just Romney but other you know when it's a female protagonists, they have a relationship with masturbation and pornography as well, so like maybe it might be different from men but there, there is that relationship there and I would hope that. Whoever i'm with would have some kind of understanding or compassion or shared experience there, but then i'm also thinking like. Like one thing that annoys me is like when when women will watch a TV that I don't like, but then i'll say, well, what if they don't like me watching pornography so. So, like. It reminds me of the movie Belen john where he he has he's a young man like me, but he ends up having a relationship with a much older women, because you know they both have something that they each need. But they discover that and other related in their past relationships, if there was like an imbalance or one sided thing or like you know she doesn't want him watching pornography, but he doesn't want her watching you know beverly hills housewives."
748.0,Provider,Which is another kind of pornography.
11304.0,Patient,Right so.
748.0,Provider,I mean yeah.
11304.0,Patient,"So I guess my bed at my better self is saying well what if there could be a situation where she asked me to watch this TV show with her and somehow i'm able to. Just live my life and and somehow enjoy it by because it's a shared moment with her rather than. You know, trying to resist whatever I don't like you know what I mean right."
748.0,Provider,Right and sit in judgment.
11304.0,Patient,"Right right so maybe there was there's a way to watch beverly hills housewives with her without any type of judgment, without any kind of copying or conflict. Though."
748.0,Provider,"Or that it's making some statement about who she really is and. Right right right bad and. All of those really it ends up being about fear right. yeah as opposed to assessment it isn't really assessing the situation and that doesn't fit for me, which is where we want to be able to be. Instead it's ooh if she likes that that means. i'm probably with the wrong person and then, and then we just go into rumination that is."
11304.0,Patient,"yeah I do I have those thoughts around women often when I when I, but then i'm I go back and i'm like but wait like. That doesn't change the way I feel doesn't change my attraction my initial attraction to this person, you know, like i'm still attracted to her like it doesn't So yes, it is fear, because sometimes i'll be working with my co workers and. You know i'm attracted to them and there'll be talking about. The bachelorette and I initially i'm disgusted but, as I kind of observe. observe observe my thoughts i'm like but wait like. That it's such a huge dark cloud over what's really important don't like you know."
748.0,Provider,yeah and yeah I hear that you're really using it as a as an opportunity for self examination. yeah then follow running down that rabbit hole of judgment.
11304.0,Patient,"yeah. So I can jump to judgment really quickly, so I think it would be a good. exercise for me i'm really hoping that I can. know I am planning to have a picnic with someone someone in my life will have a picnic with me i'm going to manifest manifesting that right now."
748.0,Provider,But for you.
11304.0,Patient,Turn yes.
748.0,Provider,"I like that that's a great goal, do you have anybody in mind."
11304.0,Patient,i'm.
748.0,Provider,ugly or their. variety of.
11304.0,Patient,"People there's a variety of I mean I work with a lot of beautiful people so like, but there are a few that I feel like maybe they could be really fun to hang out with I don't know so. yeah maybe cecily maybe. Sarah maybe. Michelle. I mean they're all fun I think they're all funny and I enjoy hanging out with them so maybe maybe I could invite one of them to a picnic."
748.0,Provider,"That sounds wonderful. and which one feels like the one that would be would offer you. An opportunity to feel relaxed and calm about the experience, as well as that anticipatory excitement that can come along with it."
11304.0,Patient,"i'm either cecily or Sarah though I know more about cecily that I know about Sarah I don't really know much about her, but I do feel an attraction there so by both are funny and I enjoy their company."
748.0,Provider,"Great what makes them stand out to you, besides the sense of humor I really here sense of humor is important to you."
11304.0,Patient,yeah maybe sense of humor I always get so nervous when people ask me these questions because i'm like I don't really know what to look for here.
748.0,Provider,And you don't have to know.
11304.0,Patient,I so Sarah it seems like she could be very creative i've heard her mention that she likes to. Go to a lot of music festivals and shows and she's interested she has a developed interest in music. and I like the way that she talks about TV and movies and. kind of has a good sense of humor there and cecily you know she's just so kind all the time. and yeah I don't. Does she just seems like she'd be fun to have a conversation.
748.0,Provider,"Okay, well, and you can let that just keep sort of settling in and see which one feels like the best person to ask first and, obviously, you can go out with both of them."
11304.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
748.0,Provider,"And maybe one would be a picnic and one would be something different, so that it doesn't become about comparison."
11304.0,Patient,"Oh, I like that that's that's interesting okay."
748.0,Provider,"And, but it does sound as though you're ready to take all the work you've been doing out into the world of relationship."
11304.0,Patient,"yeah yeah I think it'd be fun, I guess, I could mention now. living with my grandmother is wonderful it's been an unforgettable experience, however, it is an unstable living situation we have confronted each other, several times. Since living together and. We keep coming to the conclusion that I need I need to move out at some point. However, I love living here, even though we kind of both agree that i'll have to leave at some point so um. it's had living here has been rejuvenating it's been it's given me so much life, energy, however it's hard to make plans, when you know. At some point, possibly soon, I could not be able to live here anymore, so I have to you know shift my life, again, which is another great new beginning. So I don't know if it's maybe it's there's an element of fear there that prevents me from making plans with other people like well i'm not going to live here. much longer and my you know I might have to change jobs, again, you know transferred to a job in stores, I wonder if that element of fear is preventing me from. asking people on a picnic."
748.0,Provider,"Right right that sense of impermanence. Right, on the other hand, everything is impermanent."
11304.0,Patient,Right so might as well just do it.
748.0,Provider,"Like Nick doesn't tie you to an entire lifetime. right when you say that you'll need to move Does that mean move out of the area, as well as out of this face."
11304.0,Patient,I don't know I mean.
748.0,Provider,"Okay, so it's all unknown at this point."
11304.0,Patient,"Yes, I don't yeah I don't know what's going to happen. But just to illustrate some of the challenges that I have with my grandma. She she has she's she has in poor health for mental health and physical health she's very unhappy. She probably is an alcoholic, unfortunately. Though i'm i'm open to using the word chemical dependency, because I don't think it needs to be so dramatic but."
748.0,Provider,"yeah it's addiction it's. No alcoholic is such a charged word in our culture, but addiction addiction is addiction."
11304.0,Patient,yeah yeah so now she's deeply unhappy and oftentimes when i'm interacting with her i'm like in my attic interacting with the real you or am I interacting with the thing that lives inside you that's like a you know so.
748.0,Provider,How am I interacting with someone who is under the influence.
11304.0,Patient,"Right, which can be sometimes often she has different triggers and her life is actually. it's it's chaotic but, from my perspective, it could be managed if if she was she had helped, but she I don't think she's open minded to getting help right now. So i'm living with someone who I love and enjoy being around however she's deeply unhappy. So. oftentimes it's very challenging kind of navigating. What what hope behavior is going to do, because right now she's being triggered by her desperate financial situation. she's hoping to God that she's going to get a reverse mortgage so she can have money to do whatever I don't know what she really wants to do with the money. she's living on social security and. My intuition tells me that it's probably going to get to the point where I have to decide if i'm going to pay her rent money because right now. I just do I work two days a week for her doing chores and yard work. But after way like you know, is it worth paying her rent money because I love this property so much or should since i'm paying rent should I just go ahead and just create my own life somewhere else you know. yeah so but i've never been more creative. anywhere, I mean this is, I feel so. Creative here like I get so much work done, I have time to work on my artwork and I, like the way that my schedule is set up so it's like i'm a bit hesitant to leave this place in a hurry, you know."
748.0,Provider,Pretty ideal. yeah so the reason that you would need to move i'm pretty sure you said that she wants you to leave.
11304.0,Patient,She wants me to leave.
748.0,Provider,And the reason for that is.
11304.0,Patient,I don't necessarily know that she has a reason I think she.
748.0,Provider,Probably she doesn't want to be witnessed.
11304.0,Patient,i'm not what I don't know what that means.
748.0,Provider,"Well, it when you tell me that she's very unhappy and doesn't want anyone else to come in to help and that she's probably a practicing alcoholic and then she doesn't want to be seen, there is that pulling in and isolating that happens when someone is in a chemically dependent process. and And the thing she wants most is connection but she's pushing it away."
11304.0,Patient,"yeah so I can tell that what she wants the most for me, is my my energy and attention that I give her because we have a good time, you know we we actually genuinely enjoy each other's company we're always talking about music and. You know laughing together, and I think she's amazing. But she's so dead set and hell bent on her problems, you know her financial problems or health problems that those are always a much bigger cloud than any type of love, I can offer so."
748.0,Provider,Well she's consumed by fingers. yeah those problems are all all about fear.
11304.0,Patient,"hey. Okay. Okay sounds good. So, yes."
748.0,Provider,"But that's you know those are both both situations that are run by our fear and you know when we're in which is a port which is a pain body right it's being in the pain body and when we're in pain we want to push away push away push away so. You know I don't I obviously don't know your grandmother and but and I don't know you well yet, but i'm wondering if there's any way that you can feel that the word show up that she says she wants you to move But is that really what she wants."
11304.0,Patient,I can't tell you that I think it might my intuition tells me that she has no idea what she wants and no matter what happens. I don't think she'll I don't think she'll never I don't think we'll ever definitively say you have to leave now I think she'll just always say you know you're not doing anything here like.
748.0,Provider,wow.
11304.0,Patient,"Well, she will well she kind of implies that she'll say like. You know there's trauma she confessed to me many different things. She. she's been scammed and her husband died, five years ago she's been scammed by scam artists on the phone she gave somebody 11,000 then one of her neighborhood friends, she gave 80,002. and But then one day she also confessed that she was actually abused by her brother, she was sexually abused by her brother. So there was like. But I was very surprised that she shared that with me because I she doesn't seem like she's open to talking about really hard topics like that. But I think, because there is an element of me that makes her feel comfortable Maybe she just kind of just something about her about it came out. But."
748.0,Provider,Well yeah so we have we kind of have a shared history in that.
11304.0,Patient,"You know, we both for sexually abused. But."
748.0,Provider,sounds like that's a big piece of your family lineage.
11304.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
748.0,Provider,what's her and other family members.
11304.0,Patient,right because.
748.0,Provider,"The other thing i'm hearing that you might want to think about is dashi value and need that ability to share and be finally have an outlet, but then she feels exposed and wants to push you away. Right."
11304.0,Patient,yeah I don't know that's a good enough and it's something you can't.
748.0,Provider,"figure out but I, because unless she tells you and she knows. yeah but at the same time, in terms of you making the discernment regarding whether or not you really need to leave it may be blessed stir rather than her real desire."
11304.0,Patient,"yeah and keep monitoring net. yeah and today we're supposed to get the bombshell of whether or not she gets a reverse mortgage so i'm expecting the pain body to be present today and. So i'm kind of preparing myself to be challenged and. But she we may also get news that they give her all the money that she wants However, I also feel like it's a it'll it'll be a bandaid on."
748.0,Provider,"humor oh my gosh yes, I didn't realize the process was already in its yeah anyway, my opinion is not relevant, but. But my experience and information around that is it's. Not a good thing, so."
11304.0,Patient,"Oh yeah reverse mortgages horrible I mean she's. But she's been she has a long history of making horrible financial decisions so i'm expecting there to be financial disaster, no matter what. But. I don't know I just I still just every day, I was like I can't believe I live in this magical place."
748.0,Provider,"And it it feels like after a long period of time, but not feeling very stable based on where you were it says really healing for you."
11304.0,Patient,"yeah it is, it is."
748.0,Provider,But it's.
11304.0,Patient,A different kind of unstable here. Not yeah not.
748.0,Provider,"Not as related to move. It sounds like. Right somebody else's mood and and their reactions, rather than your own ability to make a choice. Right yeah. So how can you i'm imagining that if you're leaving in November, we still have at least one session one. yeah and it's probably every two weeks i'm brand new but that's what i'm seeing is that."
11304.0,Patient,"yeah I think I believe I just scheduled one with you, I either on the 23rd or the 28th."
748.0,Provider,"So, between now and then. What would be some ways that you might contemplate. Staying centered and grounded in what's true for you. Which feels as though it is being very happy, where you are. And really loving it and having the potential to cultivate a new level of relationship and I don't mean a long term relationship, I mean you've been alone, except at work and and so starting to move out again after Kobe again moving. Yes, and so forth. So really developing more of that part of who you are as an adult man."
11304.0,Patient,"yeah I think that will be so much fun and i'm a bit nervous, but I feel like this moment that we're sharing it's it's maybe it could be a sign or an opportunity to say okay like maybe it's time to jump off a cliff and. Just kind of trust the process, you know really take that risk and I don't know find a way to get someone out onto a picnic I don't know I just that's it'll be my dream."
748.0,Provider,out that's such a kind and simple dream it's a dream that deserves to come true.
11304.0,Patient,Thank you.
748.0,Provider,"And the other one that feels important is continuing that work with the pain body. Yes, and and the recognition of the fact that it's the external world providing you with an opportunity to grow and seeing your grandmother as one of the vehicles."
11304.0,Patient,yeah totally.
748.0,Provider,"And when she starts to talk about you need to move or you don't do enough to recognize that isn't about you, it isn't it isn't truth with a capital T. Right it's true in the moment that it's happening with a small T but it isn't truth with a capital T it isn't a dictate that means you need to start packing. right and it may be that you need to remove yourself for a few hours and say, well, I can hear that you really want to be alone. yeah and then you extricate yourself and you go do some of your art or. or meditate or whatever other things you do to to nourish and nurture yourself."
11304.0,Patient,"But yeah maybe that could be good language, because sometimes she does want to argue and fight with me and like maybe that could be a good line to say like maybe i'm hearing that we need to be apart right now for a little while yeah."
748.0,Provider,"That you're really wanting some space. yeah yeah and i'm happy to go take you know, take the time to work on this project that i'm working on and. yeah let me know if you need anything."
11304.0,Patient,"that's a good I like that, too, because then it provides an opportunity to kind of soften the."
748.0,Provider,"Exactly and and then you can keep reinforcing to that if she reaches out to you. to argue that isn't a need that needs to include include, you of course you're not going to use that language, but you know you can reinforce if she says, I really need some help moving this from here to there you support that. is absolutely at you, and you say gee it sounds like you're still feeling. Like you need some space. I mean great language, thank you. yeah absolutely. Absolutely. And just as a sort of yeah we've still got a few minutes. Just as a sort of returning to the beginning of what you were talking about and me wanting to make sure I address it. In terms of the work that you've been doing around. Pornography battlefield so as though. You almost and i'm putting words in your mouth, but it's what I heard you perceive or feel that it's a compulsion at times is that accurate."
11304.0,Patient,"Well, I. I always give myself to watch it. Sometimes i'll use it when I masturbate sometimes like well. But sometimes it feels more urgent and it feels like okay like. Maybe this it'll be easier. And it'll just make it easier to masturbate basically. Okay okay."
748.0,Provider,"Okay, all right all right well that's that's different I was hearing it that you were trying to put boundaries around it. At one point that you would you would learn that's Okay, and you didn't need to feel guilty or ashamed, or any of those things that are places on having any sort of sexual ideation or thought. You know it's it's fine to obsess about that I don't know who it would be in Sam in sacramento but or whether you've ever followed sports but i'll just say buying to obsess about the 40 niners. And about or about a golf but it's not fine to have any sort of an inclination towards your own sexuality. Right yeah. But anyway, I wasn't absolutely certain so i'm glad I clarified it doesn't sound like you're really feeling any stress around it anymore."
11304.0,Patient,"not really and I always just I always say. Am I resisting pornography, because if I am, then, that means that i'm feeling shame and guilt around it, so I say resist nothing if you want to watch pornography, you can. But you know it's not always the case and if I had a child and a son and he was watching pornography, I would think that that's totally normal and. If he did have some feelings and shame of guilt around it, I would say, well son just sexuality in general there's a lot of. feelings of shame and guilt and I would say that, but it has nothing to do with who you are, you know you're a wonderful person and, like you, you know if you want to do that, you can. But maybe you know don't let it inhibit any of your relationships. use it as if it doesn't have any relationships use it as a challenge and be honest with whoever's confronting you about it, or if you're confronting yourself, you know yeah."
748.0,Provider,"Okay, well, I I appreciate clarification in the. yeah that greater understanding. And i'm i'm wondering when you came to break her was there a feeling that you were depressed where they're presenting issues that I just want to make sure we address all of that, before you exit and make sure that you're feeling like the need to be met."
11304.0,Patient,"Well i've already told Tara and in my surveys, you know bright heart has exceeded my expectations, I have no idea that it was going to be so wonderful and. You know I really came into bright heart with the energy of the anti racist work, because I was concerned about these questions around healing and my thoughts around pornography and. The history of CSA and my family, so I think I approached bright heart with a kind of a nervous curiosity and sense of wanting to heal myself, on a personal level, and I think what I where I ended up was is that i've kind of really softened my feelings around. sexuality and pornography and ceiling open to if any of my family members want to open up to me, which they have like I said, with my grandmother that I feel like i'm i'm a space for healing I that's my being right yeah."
748.0,Provider,And what about your anti racist work or cultural trauma work.
11304.0,Patient,"i've i've since discontinued that I haven't continued since I moved up to you, with my grandmother i've. i've really dove really deeply into some classes with the eckhart totally. foundation and then also into my own artwork so. Right now, I feel like those are more important than the anti racist."
748.0,Provider,"Okay okay just curious. Just curious alright well if there's anything else that you feel like I need to know before we close the session so that I can be more support, please let me know."
11304.0,Patient,"Thank you, and then I guess either today or tomorrow i'll probably contact the virtual clinic and just let them know officially that I plan to take my exit from bright heart. At some point in November and kind of get the logistics of that so that you will know, when our last meeting is."
748.0,Provider,"That sounds wonderful. yeah and, if you want to take sort of an assessment of. What is next for you in terms of our next session and and let me know you could let me know in the chat during our group or I don't know if there's any other way for you to get me information but."
11304.0,Patient,I can always ask them if you have a bright heart email I think they give you our email.
748.0,Provider,"Yes, I do I do. Okay, that would be fine. Okay, all right."
11304.0,Patient,Thank.
748.0,Provider,You so much it was really an honor to get to know you today.
11304.0,Patient,"As usual, thank you."
748.0,Provider,"All right, take good care of you."
11304.0,Patient,You too bye bye.
