14627.0,Patient,"I have. Okay, she residential. Intensive outpatient on sorry."
724.0,Provider,"Okay yeah so there's probably a good chance that you've done one of these things before it's called a bio psychosocial assessment. or it's like social assessment and it's pretty standardized practice amongst therapy and it comes from a medical and psychological. perspective so we're going to ask you questions pertaining to those two those two areas and I a couple sections based on environmental factors like occupation social settings peer groups stuff like that, and then we'll cover some substance abuse history to. Like I said it's pretty standardized The idea is that once the assessment is done any you know any qualified professional could pick it up, not having performed the assessment themselves like read it and get a general idea. Of who you are and what areas, they would work on developing a treatment plan with make sense. Yes, okay cool do you have any questions about the program thus far, before we start."

Okay, so if you have any questions or concerns during this assessment that you don't feel comfortable with like answering some of these questions by all means just be like hey I don't want to talk about that and we'll move on to a later time okay. Alright, so Lastly, we have about an hour to complete this. Sometimes they run long sometimes they run short really depends on how well or how quickly we can get through the questions. Now some of the questions will piggyback on other questions down the road and so like separate sections, so I will just clarify that I go when we're in the category that we stay within that category and an example would be like. What medication you're taking and if you're taking something for physical health and then you're like oh yeah I will take this thing for my mental health we'll get to the mental health medication and separate. Somebody who's gonna watch this video a transcriber and it helps them stay on point if we stay within like subject lines okay. All right, i'm."

724.0,Provider,"Okay, we don't have to get to see. A lot of this stuff is like like an approximate you're gonna. you'll be with medical professionals and they'll get. Okay, so it's ugly and they could probably pull your MED REC and know exactly like where you get your prescriptions filled that what you're taking and all that.

724.0,Provider,"Okay, good yeah i'll share a little story with you because the patient's no longer on this side of the grass, he was one of our frequent flyers and the er for being intoxicated and. Towards the end like his his interactions with us we're becoming very apparent and more frequent and we were like his name was can, or like. we're like Jesus can, what are you doing man and he was like I you know you know he had a problem, and he always refused detox he'd come in, or like i'm just gonna sleep here tonight and then. take off in the morning and it's like you up, and it was it was a sweet guy never really gave us a hard time we had patients that were drunk and we literally have to fist fight them all. yeah so he was one of the like more of the welcomed you know, like walking wounded, that we would see and we're like all right. And I remember the last time that I saw me came in, he was all banged up and we're just like geez can't like what you got to be careful and he's like I know, and then we found out like a week later that somebody falling dead and his room. yeah he had fallen and hit his head on some machinery, or some kind of some kind of object, I said in his house and that nurse who live in the same apartment complex that worked at the hospital was the one that follow me she was devastated oh."
14627.0,Patient,yeah.
724.0,Provider,yeah it's it's really dicey.
14627.0,Patient,"Oh, I know, and the thing The thing is, too, because this apartment that i'm living in his new I don't have very little furniture. yeah so I mean just for me that I didn't have anything to hold on to."
724.0,Provider,Like or do I didn't. fall or brace yeah.
14627.0,Patient,"Just a bed, and I couldn't even reach the door knob to my bedroom door because I couldn't get off the bed. Well, I mean it was crazy, it was beyond crazy in anything and it's so everything here so long and narrow that. I mean it looks like a gazillion miles of way, but when you can't walk."
724.0,Provider,or I.
14627.0,Patient,"might as well, all I kept hitting was the Grameen on the hardwood floors and there are, and I just kept hitting them because I kept telling myself, if I can get to the front door and unchained the door, then at least I can find my way to the phone."
724.0,Provider,or an hour and when one. or yellow you know.
14627.0,Patient,"Because that was my goal, but I couldn't get to the front door well I couldn't make it, it took me days to get there. it's terrifying yeah oh yeah."
724.0,Provider,So did you do a medical detox someplace.
14627.0,Patient,never know where.
724.0,Provider,"So after you left the hospital, you were."
14627.0,Patient,I went back home.
724.0,Provider,So no withdrawal symptoms after your House well.
14627.0,Patient,"I was extremely exhausted, like, I am now i'm like well i'm not exhausted a morning star chick."
724.0,Provider,yeah I mean your energies. Your body into recovery mode so.
14627.0,Patient,You know. The worst.
724.0,Provider,yeah what is spent through the I consider what it's been through it's probably healing itself and converting all the necessary energy that you have to like repair so yeah you're going to be brought down for a little bit okay. Any issues with activities of daily living grooving hygiene.
14627.0,Patient,"No, I get up I have I go to work every day Monday through Friday. So I get up I shower I kind of do my thing but i'm still like it's more like it's, not even a fog, because the fog would be more like when I get up in the morning from drinking The night before this is more like a Malays. yeah you're dragging I can't shake it I just can't shake it."
724.0,Provider,"it'll probably be like that, for a bit, you know as your body react with made some readjust you gotta you gotta look at things to on like a. Like a chemical level right so like if your your hormones and your transmitters and everything is kind of like out of whack for a long time it's like unstable. Eventually it's going to do this until it starts to get back to its natural levels and in the meantime your body is going to be as it's going like this crazy with my hands. Your body is going to be adjusting you know what I mean like your energy levels are going to be up it's gonna be down you got to make sure you're getting enough rest, you could. drink enough water you're gonna make sure you're taking like proper nutrients, because your body's repairing itself, you know from from years of you know, neglect, you know. Say kindly so yeah you're probably going to be like being that state for a little bit i'm not a doctor, but. My experience with people like. During like the initial stages of recovery like they're dragging ass you know the put it, to put it lightly so."
14627.0,Patient,"No, you really I really am I mean it's like yeah."
724.0,Provider,"You know, so I worked, when I worked at impatient programs, we would we'd go pick up clients and patients from wherever the jail wherever and they would come in, and it was just like. Just not processing like at 100% and nowhere near but typically by like the 90 day point, like the lights would turn on like it was like the cloud bank we just leave. And it was just like oh hey."
14627.0,Patient,It was my favorite part of the job because I got I got a buddy.
724.0,Provider,"Oh hey what's that it's nice to meet you finally. Because they were like zombies in the beginning, oh."
14627.0,Patient,So true.
724.0,Provider,"But you're ahead of that you're definitely no zombie right now, because if you're. going to work and function at doing this stuff you're already ahead of the game so. Like the like these people, they were straight out of jail and just just had it. Like for a while, so. It was a lot of work, but they get there, like the body is very adaptable and does amazing things if you allow it to do it and it's and resiliency and all those things so it's important. OK, the next section is going to be emotional and behavioral cognitive so have you ever been diagnosed officially would have mental health concerns such as Depression and anxiety. Both both okay. yeah what age were you diagnosed with depression will go there."
14627.0,Patient,"Well, initially, it was ptsd and that was when I first saw out treatment that was in 2000, but that was specific to the loss of my father. And then I stayed in it was a short term grief focused treatment and that helped me greatly. And picture. No, no, it was. outpatient okay yeah so I had a therapist and I had a psychiatrist aside put me on selects and then I saw my therapist once a week. And she helped me through that that trauma. But that was in 2000. I didn't see. psychiatric treatment until my first. hospitalization and that's when I started seeing a psychiatrist I saw him at the hospital and then I started seeing him when I was out of the hospital once a week. Okay, and he diagnosed me with Depression and anxiety."
724.0,Provider,"Okay, and what year was that."
14627.0,Patient,It had to be whatever that. mm hmm.
724.0,Provider,"Okay, and did they put this new one have they prescribed anything to you are, you still taking it."
14627.0,Patient,"know the the medicine, he taught me on a few and we discontinued those the only one that has kept me on was trying to dumb. And he started me at 50 then he up to 200 he opted to 150 and told me the most I should take us 300 exactly and so when I told my goal is actually a lot, and he said, but the thing is, is that which is true i'm not staying asleep I am falling asleep, but I wasn't staying asleep."
724.0,Provider,"Right, so what you. and keep reading yeah."
14627.0,Patient,"Can you see me sleep. yeah and so because of my anxiety i'm afraid to like fall asleep like that, because I have a fear of not waking up and that's what I told him I go on to sedated i'm afraid that I will wake up. Right and so he was like well, then you have to comment yeah you know, and I love this I love this manner his mannerisms you know it's like listen man you gotta decide, you know I know you're anxious I know you're worried and scared that won't wake up, but. i'm just gonna let me."
724.0,Provider,pick the lesser of two evils like.
14627.0,Patient,"Exactly, so the only met that I stayed on faithfully that I stayed prescribed was tracked it down okay."
724.0,Provider,"Are you still taking our, though."
14627.0,Patient,Oh no i'm only on the gap opinion okay.
724.0,Provider,"All right, um. Do you know what the dosages for the gabba pens."
14627.0,Patient,Dr ogawa drop me from 400 to 300 okay.
724.0,Provider,And what's that as needed or do you have like a like a scheduled time.
14627.0,Patient,"Well, usually was prescribed initially when I left the hospital was 400 at that time, but it's still I felt a little don't be. ya know it makes sense, the night that you know the next day so and it actually kind of last like I don't really need it every day, so we talked about it yesterday and group, before we start our group session. And I told her I said I can really take one pill and be good for like two days so she said, well then, you know kind of stay the course it helps me don't get me wrong."
724.0,Provider,"What are you taking it for because I know what like the off brand. thing is for, but I think it's like initially it's an Anti convulsive isn't it like it's for."
14627.0,Patient,It kind of treats a few things.
724.0,Provider,"So yeah so like the primary objective for, for it is the anti convulsion. The secondary effects or what they would call it the off labeling effects that it has it's like for. their pain. You know it's got some of that stuff and so like a lot of the patients that I deal with the the essentially take it for nerve pain it like some pain or leave. But really what it's meant for is like anti. convulsion seizures so."
14627.0,Patient,It puts me to sleep.
724.0,Provider,yeah yeah it has that effect yeah okay.
14627.0,Patient,"Because I don't sleep I hadn't slept in years if I don't crash out from drinking I don't sleep, on my own."
724.0,Provider,And is that. Is that something that you've always dealt with her that something happened that precipitated that i'll sort of like you have difficulty sleeping.
14627.0,Patient,"I have difficulty sleeping for years um. As far back as even before my kids even when my kids were in high school I would come off for because i've always worked more than one job. So I would get off work, maybe about 11 o'clock at night, and then I would shower and you would think that would induce you to like you know you've been up all day no."
724.0,Provider,Everybody has.
14627.0,Patient,"But even when the unwinding comes, I know I need to go sleep, but I would my pattern has been to stare in wait. Stop all the stimulus because i'm not a stimulating kind of personality, the TV on I don't need to be on the phone I don't need all of that, but I can't fall asleep and then eventually at some point I don't remember falling asleep, but I do. yeah in the most I was asleep would be about three or four hours a day, I mean i'm night. yeah that's up. To do it all over again. yeah so that's been my cycle for years."
724.0,Provider,And we're.
14627.0,Patient,All it's been worse.
724.0,Provider,"yeah, of course, and have you ever tried like a sleep study, maybe got sleep apnea or."
14627.0,Patient,"I had one years ago and I did have before I had the bypass, and I did have apnea they gave me the breathing machine, but when I lost the weight I didn't need the machine."
724.0,Provider,"But how are you sleeping back then, with the machine."
14627.0,Patient,"Better I suck better it didn't put me to sleep, but the oxygen film good."
724.0,Provider,yeah like the quality.
14627.0,Patient,"I think the quality was better the duration didn't last as long. yeah I remember the days, where I can take a shower take a bath go into bed and fall asleep, naturally I do remember doing that. yeah that's been years ago. Oh it's so much time and space. it's not even funny."
724.0,Provider,yeah well there was changed oh stress.
14627.0,Patient,"yeah it is thinking about the unknown thinking about the knowns thinking about the past, you know everything's jumbled up in my brain all at once and it's like a. spiral it's just."
724.0,Provider,"yeah you ever think about like a sub daily meditation like systematically throughout the day it's like cutting like. Taking some time throughout your day to try to get into like that state where you are trying to fall asleep and then allow your brand the process so that information. periodically throughout the day, maybe, by the time you get to sleep your brains like oh we've done this, three times today we're good."
14627.0,Patient,work this out.
724.0,Provider,"Maybe we tried to do something like that, if you have. You know if you're afforded the luxury of having some free time like just go quiet place. Close the blinds you don't have a just close your eyes and just allow those thoughts come and go don't try to resolve or answer any of those questions just allow them the process come and go and see what happens try that for a little bit what's The worst thing happen, you know. You don't you could take a crappy sleep, or you learn some new insightful things, I can only see like benefits, coming from a potential so it's definitely worth the worth the effort do two. To three times a day, whatever it is."
14627.0,Patient,"I agree with that and I do i'm glad you brought that up because cassie said yesterday. I was telling them that recently and I guess in which is true, she was telling me because of the post acute with pro i've been when I do fall asleep I have these very vivid nightmares."
724.0,Provider,Oh yeah.
14627.0,Patient,"I mean like it's almost like it's actually happening versus the nightmares that ever happen, even though I knew it was a nightmare, but I also knew what I was asleep. Right and I wasn't like definitely afraid but they're vivid it's real and she told me to keep asleep journal, so the moment I wake up like out of that nightmare to just jot down what happened and then go back to you know, trying to go back to sleep yeah. yeah she did see that to me."
724.0,Provider,"Yesterday yeah because what happens to is like when your brain is sleeping, and this was explained to me so i'm probably butchering it but. What happens is that when we dream we don't dream and like a linear state so there's no like real progression or path so think of a movie that has a beginning a middle and an end that has a formula like a formula. Our dreams, we perceive our dreams, to be like that, but it's not actually how it happens when you're getting like flashbulb memories are information and they're just like. dog and then mountains and then something else, and all these things are happening and they're happening like faster than time that you can process. And then, when you wake up and you're like and you kind of out of you like Jesus that was had a dream about my dog was there in a mountain and then eventually your brain. takes that information and then tries to make a linear story out of it that's what you're trying to make sense of that you like it's so weird and then you think about it, more and more and more and more, and then eventually you formulated like an entire. treats dream sequence when it probably didn't happen like that, because your brains is this firing all kinds of stuff all the time that's why."
14627.0,Patient,sometimes violent. All violent.
724.0,Provider,"yep so. So there's something to that and sometimes I don't know if you experience it that, like when you wake up you're like it was a weird dream I can't remember all the details. And then the following day, when you go to lay down the segment your head hits the pillow it's like oh yeah I remembered all that stuff. Like oh. I forgot like. So really sleep is important, and the fact that you don't get a lot of it anyways is problematic onto itself and it's not good for your stress levels it's not good for your mental health sleep is very, very important. The sleep deprivation. is probably a reason why it's sticking with you more so because of that now, if you were able to rest more during the day process of those things more during the day, you probably wanted have such violent dreams. So again, how would I would try to stick with a little bit of like the meditation daily meditation if you're afforded that luxury just some headphones in. Close your eyes, whatever it is i'm just trying to like field, the questions of these things that are popping into your head and said just allowing me like. Okay i'll probably get four hours of sleep tonight so okay let's get this over with and then starting at their you know, try to start it earlier your day if you can. see what happens."
14627.0,Patient,i'm not trying to.
724.0,Provider,Have. Any history of substance abuse or mental health concerns in your family. mom and dad sisters.
14627.0,Patient,"substance abuse father was an alcoholic. And since preteen up until his death, but he died of emphysema and mom was diagnosed with schizophrenia in 1981 ish and didn't she cycle in and out the hospital. I want to say good for the first 10 years she may have been hospitalized maybe about three times at Kaiser. And then we were managed to stabilize Sir, I want to see more than a decade once and once they treated that tardive dyskinesia and changed her medicine. um I think that actually helped her and because of the psychosis the medication was just she just had to wrap her head around the fact that this is something that I can't she work on my own. And once she just kind of built that into her daily and kind of had you know, an understanding of it, she kept all her sack appointments and took off her meds and stayed out of the hospital well."
724.0,Provider,So she she had she had the thing with the tongue of the target.
14627.0,Patient,Oh yeah.
724.0,Provider,So she what do they call those like like generation one and I psychotics or something like that.
14627.0,Patient,"yeah you know. The old school anti psychotic. Or rather than. She was on, I want to say initially I think they put her on. A probably in a hospital had around thorazine because she had a bit of a shuffle now that I think about it, but I didn't know what I was looking at them, because I was a preteen myself. Right um and she was very heavily medicated and sedated but she needed."
724.0,Provider,My mom.
14627.0,Patient,"She needed that come down and then I tie trade her off of it. But she definitely. needed it. That said, she had that. tardive dyskinesia for years and then, when I guess medicine started to change and that was really embarrassing for her because she couldn't even sit, you know she said, like sit at the table, have a cup of coffee. And she just couldn't stop the facial twitching drooling she couldn't control, but once they switched her up that it just stopped. Oh good and yeah so but dad was an alcoholic mom had the chronic mental illness outside of that my I come i'm the youngest of four my brothers and sisters are neither no substance abusers or alcoholics or mental illness, as far as I know."
724.0,Provider,"Good all right um it's always interesting to ask those questions and and in your line of work we're always looking to see if we can come up like a correlation and family history. And I don't know if. it's like hit or miss because i'm always like did you have substance abuse in your family. And people like nope and the individual talking to is a total disaster and you're like well what happened. And then I met people were there is, and there are a total disaster and you're like okay well that kind of makes sense, your environmental factors are there. You probably predisposed to it you're definitely at more of a risk, and then I was always like. But why does, why does this person, why is like some people zig and zag like instead of like an interesting question it's like. You can be born to like two doctors and like one of two things are going to happen you're either going to become a doctor or you're going to become a total disaster it's always like. That extreme and it's like Kevin just become like a priest or so. Somebody has all the options in the world. And they either take advantage that and continue that effort, or they told me Squadron and they become disasters, they are like."
14627.0,Patient,"When it was the fear of God, you have a have to understand something about the way. I was raised, we were raised in a very Catholic family. In a very strict family, and so the six of us it was only the six of us, even though I had extended family with the cap of school as. Elementary capital guys who you know yeah so you know you, you have a very. tight view of looking at things but, even though my files alcoholic to us, he was an alcoholic. He went to work every day. You know, we had a house, we had a car, we you know we get everything was fine, but no my father was an alcoholic. yeah period in the story, and so, if anyone would have been alcoholics I would thought my brothers would be. Neither one occasional may have a beer. That they're not a holiday. did not drug addicts. my sister. Either and I didn't start drinking, I mean heavily abusing until later in my life. And i've had that convert the same conversation that you just said I had that with my brother is why me sick girl you just got you got that he's God and I don't know you just see you got it and i'm like oh great this time of my life. But yeah so it just it and then i'm drinking, not to withdraw."
724.0,Provider,"That becomes the. Once once people in you know chemical dependency. that whatever the definite the criteria is like progression tolerance and then withdraw effect so if you hit all three then technically you're chemically dependent i've met people that abuse drugs. And they mark the first two, but they never marked the third it's like okay you got chronic use abuse and. addiction right but you're not completely dependent like an other science department you're not technically chemically dependent to it, so a lot of it's like behavioral and a betrayal use of. Some when you hit all three it's a different game because it's like i'd like to stop, but if I do all these adverse effects physically start to happen, which that forces me back to us again i'm not using because i'm having a good time it's fun for me anymore. Using because I don't want to be sick so. A lot of the patients that have dealt with, I did like medication assisted so suboxone. or methadone you know I really cut my teeth in those fields, and it was like that people that were coming in. And their their dose of methadone was super high, and they would still be using and I did that why, and I was like you can't feel it they'll yeah I know, but sometimes I just like the Act and the routine of it. that's the mental part they're like I don't get high anymore. they're like. I got review their their drug screens with what i've seen with like you're still positive for all this. was like you're wasting your money at this place at that point they're like I know they're. Really, you know, but I don't want to be dope sick either you'd like the methadone works, a little bit, but you know I don't want to get six so i'm not using because I like to anywhere i'd use it because I don't want to. put it politely crapped my pants you know what i'm sitting on the bus and i'm like okay to say that makes sense yeah so that that's the struggle that a lot of people don't understand people outside of our field. don't understand how to addiction is that there is a. Physical effect that people get when they attempt to stop at people disregard that because they don't so they're like oh you're just adding and it's like. That may be true, maybe some of that part but there's a physical component that most people don't understand it's like and when you get to that point you're you're a real bad shape and you can't you can't do it on your own be like Oh, why don't you just stopped. If it was that easy I would, if it was that. But I don't want to crap my pants right here, as we have this conversation with you. Having a lot of guilt and shame is problematic, as it is in recovery so. You know that that mentality does not help but either, so you say I like there's that component of it that's the one that's manage like the most. And you need like a lot of interventions it a lot of help for medical field, you need a lot of help for the Community and understanding so yeah it's the best. All right, any history of self far. know any history of self harm or your family a. Suicide tabs completions okay. Some of the thoughts of self harm no plans, no. intention all right good briefly You said something about ptsd after your father passed away yeah. Was there any other trauma in your life emotional physical, sexual military combat."
14627.0,Patient,veteran know that event was the event.
724.0,Provider,"traumatic for you, and he passed from emphysema."
14627.0,Patient,"He did he had suffered from it for years. Very heavy smoker both he and my mother and if, as soon as what killed him, quite frankly, he because he couldn't catch his breath had a heart attack."
724.0,Provider,"Okay, all right yeah it's always like like these secondary things it's like."
14627.0,Patient,Oh absolutely.
724.0,Provider,"You know, when people like they overdose on it's like you know what that means right and they're like it took drugs and they die and it's like. Well yeah they suppress their breathing and because of that they heart slow down, and because of that, the brain was deprived of oxygen and they patent oh. yeah it's more complicated."
14627.0,Patient,Just a little bit.
724.0,Provider,"yeah yeah it's being in the hospital like I learned a lot of stuff too, and it was like they're like oh this person died in their sleep and you meet people they're like oh that's really cool that's how I hope they're going I was like I don't think it's as peaceful as people. I think. If you're dead asleep, and you have a heart attack i'm pretty sure you wake up from that. Like i'm pretty sure that your body is shutting down and not functioning right anymore you're probably somewhat aware of it, and then you just happen to be laying in bed when they find you and I was like. I love this peaceful or not going to go quietly into the night. Okay yeah we're like shuffle off this mortal coil I was like in bed I don't think that happens i'm like Okay, because i've seen people that aren't attacks when they come in it's not pleasant."
14627.0,Patient,My.
724.0,Provider,"My old man had one and, as he was having one he was at the hospital that up that I worked at later I remember he's hooked up to the monitor. That everyone's working at people are panicking I could see in his eyes and then like I watched his heart right like you know, on the machine and the doctors like took me he's like I think he's having a heart attack and I was like don't tell him that. yeah tell him that. yeah he's gonna go but. So the doctors. Sir, I think you're having a heart attack right now, and it was like be like I was like oh. They have to tell you know what I mean they have to tell. yeah going on, and I was like good bedside. But yeah. him live he's. You know they put they put those stunts Oh, and all that kind of stuff but. It is chaotic and traumatizing and all those things. So did you have a hard time processing like processing is passing."
14627.0,Patient,"You know, initially, yes, because he was no longer with us, it didn't actually I didn't realize that I had ptsd at all until I had a panic attack. i'm on my way to go into Vegas on vacation. And we were just driving up you know the highway like we normally would and I completely I thought I was going NUTS I thought I was losing my mind. And at the time I had my ex husband, because I was with my ex husband and my sister and my older sister and my mom hey what's going on with you. And I was like I just have to get out of the car I can't breathe I couldn't breathe I start sweating my heart, but like i'm gonna pop out of my chest I didn't know what was going on with me I didn't know at that time I was having a panic attack. How long have been."
724.0,Provider,Through this happened after your father passed.
14627.0,Patient,"My dad passed in chat and my dad passed January 21 20 22,000 and that occurred, I want to say. It had to be either in the spring, because I was in college, this was either during spring break or summer break, of that same year. And then, when I came back that Sunday, I called a clinic that I knew that Monday and did a phone assessment and said I need to see someone something occurred and I don't know which has happened. And so sure enough when I did the assessment, the she ended up she was doing my assessment, and she ended up remaining my therapist she said, I think what you experience was a panic attack. She said but going by your events, I think, because you experienced the trauma and I didn't even relate the two. For my dad passing and me having a panic attack and the feeling I got was completely out of control and nuts that's the way I felt and then I have to go back to school, you know, like I gotta go I gotta get it together kids are awesome you know I can't be falling apart. And so, once the sort of psychiatrists and he medicated me it just call me write down. And the therapy helped just for me to work out the events that led up to his death during when he passed and then the events afterward I never even connected any of that yeah oh yeah. yeah."
724.0,Provider,it's funny how everything works out.
14627.0,Patient,yeah That was a time.
724.0,Provider,"All right, do you attend any self help groups now do you go to like a or anything like that, on your own."
14627.0,Patient,"No, I haven't."
724.0,Provider,what's your support network build up of.
14627.0,Patient,"Right now i'm like I said I well I recently moved from La to San Francisco in May of this year i'm here permanently now I live alone. I have my daughter just recently moved up a week ago, not too far away from me, but we're not that close where someone is strange. We were before she moved back she only moves back because she knows. Permanent so there's some there's something there, but I don't want to. approach that subject but i'm just not strong enough emotionally to go there, so um but my, the reason I came up here is because my ex boss, who was not my boss now. is the one that told me to apply for this job up here ucsf and you know if you want to move I know you've been saying you want to do it for years is an opportunity, so I did it, and so my boss I but I don't like to put that pressure on him. Yes, Mike we are friends, but I don't want to like."
724.0,Provider,What aligns.
14627.0,Patient,"yeah and he's such a good man I just don't want it, I don't feel right, so I did find a church, for the first time, a Catholic Church. Actually down the street from my house within like a mile walking distance, so I went to mass, for the first time last Sunday. Most yeah it's good to."
724.0,Provider,try and get back into the.
14627.0,Patient,Welcome and.

14627.0,Patient,"Well, he was the doubt."
724.0,Provider,"yeah I mean. yeah I mean my dad used to make that joke to like anytime you go and he's like I hope, but all burned on. This one of. The worst Catholics. Worst capita know. So yeah he's he's silly like I I give him a hard time every time I see him he's very old he's like oh sad and like. Like I like i'll see anything like a giant Bible, I was like doing some good some good reading lately get a little scared are we. Trying to do some repenting now that we're. Like okay. he's a character. So what do you do for work, are you a are you working in the field, or. Or what are you doing."
14627.0,Patient,"Well yeah I used to teach him private I taught in city college. managed it patient site in La the social services department and I took an outpatient gig as a manager for the department out here i'm learning as San francisco's department of public health in La is a department of mental health. Oh, so I work for contract is site and I managed to department there and then. I just, but when you're in the midst of an addiction. I mean the doing of the job you can do in your sleep, but you have to have all cylinders firing and they weren't ago and so now i'm an adult Inpatient psych. And i'm a licensed clinical social worker, I have been for years, but i've worked in forensics i've worked in a youth authority, I was a police officer."

You know that's an Inpatient psych you know."

14627.0,Patient,"not really is what they're looking for like a movie get other backs are all up against the wall is like you know he job like oh wow that's so cute I should take a picture before and after. So, once you get the hang of it and things so i've done a live, but right now, unlike what i'm doing because it's. An administration do their thing. Let my net do her thing is being pigeon holed and I like that there's some safety in, and so I just keep my mouth shut head down do my work and keep it moving."
724.0,Provider,Good I like your attitude.
14627.0,Patient,"is the only way to spy I mean for myself, you know not just. I can't I can't i'm not at a stage phase in my life, right now, like. it's not about titles and this and that it's just I want the best for my patients and their families. But it's a job and I have to do it professionally and i'm going to work and i'm trying. And i'm on this, you know i'm like trying to shove, in as much because I knew I could pinpoint the time that I will start to shake in lean around 11 o'clock in the morning, if I didn't I couldn't bring I call work. Right, but right around that time that's when i'm going to start to sway. And my legs, are going to start feeling like spaghetti no and i'm not going to be able to stand up straight and even pretend to be okay right, so I would see who I needed to see immediately, while I was still like. Fresh yes and but drunk drunk enough to like be clear enough. To get my work done power through and then hold myself up in the office and for no one to see me for the rest of the day. And that's and also it was it was a was exhausting I had a gentleman walked me home because I would live within walking distance of the job and. The here was going down, but my legs were shaking uncontrollably and I couldn't make it down and a guy just he was so sweet you just took me by the hand and said, what do you live, I said a couple of boxes and I walking home. And he literally walked me home. And then the first thing I did was go to the market and buy something to drink, not to get drunk. yep to bring me."
724.0,Provider,back to a.
14627.0,Patient,"Year to baseline and I was like Okay, I was like maybe about seven in the evening i'm like okay now, you can have something to eat Now you can think that's crazy. yeah yep."
724.0,Provider,"that's that's the that's the dependency part where it's not really up to you anymore, you know, like your body's in control and all your automatic systems. You know, are not working like they should know amount of mental willpower or stubbornness is going to walk you through that like it's set up to you anymore, you know it's not up to you anymore. Well i'm glad you do a better on what what medications are they gonna they're gonna do any medications here for you we're."
14627.0,Patient,"going to keep. Keep me on the antabuse and keeping you on a now tracks on. Those are excellent i've never taken them before. i've had the trial shots in the past and i've taken capital in the past don't get me wrong capital works, but this combination is the absolute best no craving whatsoever."
724.0,Provider,"And i've i've heard from people at an abuse or make you pay for it, if you try to use with it."
14627.0,Patient,"And that's what the doctor told me and I told him, he says so you you sure you never taken it said no. He said I know you're going to get really sick if you drink I sit and prescribe it."
724.0,Provider,yep good.
14627.0,Patient,fit mentally I need to know that even if you do decide to pick her you're going to pay. for that. yeah that's.
724.0,Provider,"And I say about people that were on suboxone because that suboxone I was nor candidate. So if you try to like fake the Funk with suboxone to. pay for it, so it's like. I, like those built a deterrence, you know."
14627.0,Patient,"hey i'm three weeks in and. I can honestly say I go to the market, all the time, because it sells of things and just alcohol. And I can see the alcohol and not look at it, as. This is my it was almost like it was cheaper than our color she took my girlfriend you know we we have date night but then it went too far, and then it was then it was she wasn't even a date anymore, she was a necessity, and I can walk in there now and not even crave desire it or you. don't have. Alcohol dreams, you know I would have alcoholic drinks. course."
724.0,Provider,"yeah that's your that's your body being like hey you remember that time. I tell people, it will close on this, but I tell people that. are like an addiction. Especially with narcotics like if you've had a surgery and somebody is it you know, in the hospital they pop you with the stuff you're like oh wow. Like like Oh, I get it and it's like once once your brain realize that there's something out there, because you have built in receptors that could make you feel like that it's like seeing behind the curtain like the wizard of Oz it's just like you know everything else bullshit you know. There is a thing that I have access to. With significant ease that could make me feel like that all the time and it's like. yeah now now it's a it's an internal struggle that you have to make with your brain and a lot of that stuff's really not up to you, you know what I mean like just neuro chemistry is an interesting thing it's reserved for smarter people than myself to. try to understand it. Yet, but I do know like like the poles of like you know i've had surgeries before and I just had one in July and right before we went under we're watching something and. My girlfriend and I were talking about it, and I was like yeah when I went in and they put me on the on the bed the anesthesiologist they put me. pop something into me, and it was a little cool he's like hey yeah this is going to help you relax and I was like Okay, and I thought they were going to put more stuff in me and it hit me with the mask then maybe come back to 10. But they have like a computer board and like he's talking to the doctor to do their checklist and then I woke up in the recovery room like. Oh. I remember like them. talk like. watching what they were doing it was like he said that he said check check check and then I woke up, I was like. What what what's going on and just puking and they're like yeah you do puke because I told him that they're like what happens when you come out, I was like I typically throw up so i'm throwing up and he was like yeah you're right you do throw up and I was like oh yeah what happened. So the brand's it's like. Oh there's tons of this so yeah there are pitfalls to for sure. But i'm glad you're i'm glad you're feeling better i'm glad you're on the bed achy and you work in this field, to a certain degree. So you're a contributing Member of society to do the lord's work."
14627.0,Patient,"So, are you chat trust me."
724.0,Provider,"A little bit sometimes. So absolutely I appreciate it. Thank you, I will have the Karen ABS reach out to you here, probably within the week to schedule a follow up with me on your content groups with whoever your counselor was. That will be like one of your primary groups you'll meet with me a couple times a month. All based on these if it needs to increase or decrease over time, we can address that they attach surveys like they probably sent you an email with a link to do surveys so like the pH cube nine."
14627.0,Patient,completed all of them.
724.0,Provider,"yep you're gonna have to do those weekly. So absolutely you're going to for sure gonna have to do that weekly they say the pH tonight and the gad seven are done twice a month, they alternate weekly."
14627.0,Patient,Okay.
724.0,Provider,"But i've been telling my patients to just go into that link so star in your email, so you can always refer back to it that they're just. Just do them if they're there because I don't know what it looks like and I know there's some confusion about when they're doing when they're not do, but i've been telling people like on Sunday night for the upcoming week. Going into your surveys, because it's one way that we could. It appears punitive at times because of people's medications are attached to this program if they're not completing the surveys that we cut their prescriptions back to where they're seeing us weekly."
14627.0,Patient,As a way to keep them engaged guy.
724.0,Provider,"And they think it's punitive but you and I know that these are these things are done because. State federal guidelines DEA and we're national so every States got its own requirement and it seems like nobody's ever on the same page and there are tools to measure success and lack thereof. So, like if Shay co or cough comes in, and they want to audit us and, like show me how she's doing good and.
