252.0,Provider,uh huh.
16954.0,Patient,"um so I was prescribed blood to. My my psychiatrist. And the thing is the whole the timeline that that happened is that pretty much. um I was prescribed the medication and then I was sent over to my pharmacy and then after that it's I pulled up the pharmacy and they said, like oh yeah medicare doesn't cover that medication it's too expensive. So then, after that what happened was I I called up actually I submitted, or vice to write her to have them, you know, whatever the kind of requests, they have to submit to medical. yeah actually get back yeah pre authorization see I said I had them submit that request over to to medical and then about a week later. I called up medical and just ask them if they'd received a request or whatever I guess that they they didn't receive the request, so I followed up with right heart. Then I think I talked with like jurors something and then so. I she had said that she'd give me a call back or something."
252.0,Provider,That was Jamie.
16954.0,Patient,I was somebody it was a J name i'm not sure. But um but yeah So the important thing is I haven't got access to lead to die I i'm not on that medication at the moment um so I did want to address that for sure.
252.0,Provider,"Okay hold on. Go ahead and ask some questions okay. All right, see. Oh, I know where I need to go hold on."
16954.0,Patient,"So pretty much my medical said, because in my wallet them is that they needed to know, two things one, is there a tar number associated with like the request. yeah and then to is there was the request submitted to medical itself or my health care provider, which would be. The San Francisco help phone That was the two things that they said that they need I should I should ask you so but yeah I mean because uh yeah that's pretty much I told the last person to."
252.0,Provider,i'm gonna go i'm going into your chart right now to see. i'm looking.
16954.0,Patient,"Jacob okay yeah no problem, thank you."

16954.0,Patient,yeah I got some email about that yeah.
252.0,Provider,All right. Let me put.
16954.0,Patient,I mean yeah I didn't really receive like any bad support it was just like hey. I yeah cuz I think I was supposed to start the medication like two weeks ago.
252.0,Provider,"Like two weeks ago for sure. cures what it is. They are looking for it's called cures. and See. Okay, so we're going to you. Did you get your. seroquel."
16954.0,Patient,yeah I did get that at the pharmacy like maybe a month or so yeah.
252.0,Provider,"You got that just fine Okay, let me do that."
16954.0,Patient,"yeah I think it was the issue with the price, because the to to. What they were the pharmacy was saying is that if you're uninsured it's like 1200 dollars or something. So the. The for yeah the dose that. That I had. And then, like I guess matt ecologists looked at that, and they said oh that's too expensive, or something they don't want to cover it so."
252.0,Provider,"They cover it you just have to have. Pre authorization I believe i'm part of that excuse me, is a piece of paper that's called cure see you are yes and it just says. why it is that you need that. Why it's important that you have it, and. The doctor I believe does occur does your cures. Excuse me, all right. Okay. Have you been waiting for this prescription."
16954.0,Patient,"um whoa I mean, I think it was prescribed about two weeks gone i'm not sure."
252.0,Provider,"alright. So what i'm doing. Is I am sending this to marry. To the care navigator and my supervisor, so that we can get this handled ASAP okay."
16954.0,Patient,sounds good yeah.
252.0,Provider,"I understand. That they need, I mean. Pre authorization is. Where we call them, or we send them information showing you know why you need this medication right and the cures really kind of backs that information up so of course they get they're going to be waiting for that before they're willing to pay for 1200 dollar read."
16954.0,Patient,Right yeah.
252.0,Provider,"um so that's done, I will see Mary tomorrow too. So I will be able to reiterate that, with her tomorrow as well, OK. cuz we want you to get your may have you been on the to do before."

16954.0,Patient,"I mean pretty non great I mean like. i've just been like. Anything, this is a maybe it's it's seasonal because, like this is one of the hardest months of the year, for me, because of like just the weather and because it gets dark early and stuff but I mean generally not not not great yeah."
252.0,Provider,"me and are you getting up and moving, or are you finding it difficult to. stay active."
16954.0,Patient,"Well, I mean I do, I take my dog for walks and stuff I don't like I mean I don't do heavy like Cardio or anything but I do leave the House, I mean I gotta go for walks and stuff so."
252.0,Provider,"Good yeah The more that you do little eat just things like that is good enough, you know, the more you're you're doing things like that the better off it is we're and I think that once you get your medication that's going to help level that out too. huh Okay, so I put in ASAP. Request alright, so that that will help you um And what about did you find anything out about your finances as far as an employment and that kind of stuff."
16954.0,Patient,"yeah I got that worked out, I should be five minute one minute workouts so yeah."
252.0,Provider,Good one less stressor right. yeah okay good good good and anything else hauser anxiety.
16954.0,Patient,"Well um. I mean it's not like anxiety. That i'm. That I mean I haven't it's just depression, I mean i've never I don't really have anxiety or panic attacks or. Any psychosis or anything like that I just I just feel very not motivated and depressed at this point so which may be a stressor for my job or something i'm not sure, but. And I just feel like very, very fed up with things you know just the way things are, unfortunately, just like the way America is the way the. system is run the way our healthcare is the way low ages, and I mean i'm just very fed up with a lot of things and it's just like it makes it hard for me to even like want to join the workforce, again, it feels like so."
252.0,Provider,"yeah no I totally I totally understand that it can be very, very, very, very frustrating, and I am sure that what happened with your last job definitely plays a factor in it you're kind of side blind you know you're kind of side blinded on that. yeah something that you were expecting so. there's that part right you got into a routine you were you know, we had been there 678 months."
16954.0,Patient,yeah so it's hard yeah.
252.0,Provider,"So you got into a routine you know you had your schedule going, and then you get sideswiped upside the head, you know which something you weren't prepared for. So there is a little bit of grieving that goes with that. Right. yeah especially, especially when you weren't expecting it if you seen it coming that'd be one thing, but you didn't even know it was anything like that was on you know, on the table so."
16954.0,Patient,it's bound.
252.0,Provider,To be you know.
16954.0,Patient,"yeah I mean I didn't receive like any negative performance reviews or anything like that so um no, it was very unexpected."
252.0,Provider,"understand you have every right to be. You know what I mean did not feel okay with it. But you, you said that this is something you go through usually around this time every year."
16954.0,Patient,I don't do the best during the winter yeah I mean I much my mom it's a lot better during spring summer for sure.
252.0,Provider,Understandable definitely do you know when you did your blood tests that they checked your vitamin D level.
16954.0,Patient,"it's always low, but I take I take. For the I take 2000 you guys vitamin D every single day. So maybe I need to take them or something i'm just not sure, because I have. I have, I take supplements for it."
252.0,Provider,I would ask Mary and. I know that when our vitamin D gets low that it can it plays a factor in our in our mood it plays a factor and. Excuse me i'm feeling drained and tired all the time. It plays a factor in all of that. So maybe. I will bring that up to marry to.
16954.0,Patient,"Okay, I mean I know for a fact i'm very deficient in vitamin d like i've had multiple blood draws and they've all said the same thing, but I take vitamins for it, but I guess i'm just like super deficient i'm not sure so."
252.0,Provider,"So it might yeah you might need to talk to Mary about getting it up. yeah you know. I think it's like excuse me. i've been doing that all day. When we're when we're vitamin D deficient, I know that I was taking one pill, a week, and it was like some godly amount like 24,000 I use or whatever and meet you might need that little boost to. So I will bring it up to marry in the morning to when I talked to her by early today."
16954.0,Patient,Okay sounds good.
252.0,Provider,And maybe that will help. And what about your sleep how's your sleep and your appetite.
16954.0,Patient,"asleep, I mean my sleep is fine. i'm I have my dog with me aside he always wakes me up in the morning and I go to bed around 12 wake up at eight, so I mean, I have a pretty normal sleep schedule right now. And then, as far as eating I I kind of fast sometimes like i'll fast during the day, a lot but i'm generally I because I have the tendency to overheat. Especially with seroquel because i've been told it as the the tendency to increase your appetite."
252.0,Provider,"Okay, so if you don't eat during the day you eat at night."
16954.0,Patient,yeah yeah I do.
252.0,Provider,Is that when you get hungry to eat.
16954.0,Patient,yeah exactly because after I take the circle. It makes me like like super hungry so yeah.
252.0,Provider,"Okay well. Remember hold on. Remember that. Eating in the day, obviously, is going to be better for your body your digestive system everything when we eat at night, and we get in the routine of that right we're then our body doesn't get hungry until until the meantime so we got to kind of work on readjusting it a little bit. And I know that for myself if I ate like I might not be hungry in the morning, but if I eat something small. All of a sudden, a few days later i'm hungry at that time in the morning. You know, and so maybe instead of not eating all day maybe eat a little bit during the day. You know. And then, when you take yourself for seroquel at night, you might still get the munchies from it, but maybe not as bad."
16954.0,Patient,um yeah I suppose I could do small interest yeah.
252.0,Provider,"yeah just try to just try to switch it just a little bit, so that what happens is if we eat at night, which you probably already know this when we eat at night, and then we go to bed. Right, and so our body, it has no chance of burning anything it's just processing that and that's when we're going to gain weight. So if we do it in the daytime and we if you don't eat in the morning, but you get up any piece of toast or just something to get your body re adjusted to eating during the day, you know, then all of a sudden you'll find yourself hungry during the day. And maybe just a snack up with Sarah will at night, you know. We think about that."
16954.0,Patient,yeah yeah i'll give it a try.
252.0,Provider,Okay okay good So what about your water intake.
16954.0,Patient,I drink enough water. yeah I do drink water yeah.
252.0,Provider,"Okay, good do you drink a lot wider a little bit of water."
16954.0,Patient,I drink at least a couple accounts but yeah like.
252.0,Provider,Like 1220 how many.
16954.0,Patient,"answers, or at least the least like like a couple classes of yeah."
252.0,Provider,"Okay okay well that's a start right and. You want to at some point we're coming increasing your water intake maybe a couple more a day. Okay, you know. Because that also helps. Our body regulate good um. What about so we've talked about your sleep your appetite your water intake. Your daily routine. What are some of the things that. That you want to do, but you haven't been able to do I know the last time we talked it was painting right."
16954.0,Patient,yeah I mean I like visual I but i'm more into music recently making and producing music.
252.0,Provider,So you not working and being on being able to add finances okay right now. Knowing that part is taking care of have you been able to focus some time to that.
