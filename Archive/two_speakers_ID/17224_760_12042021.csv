17224.0,Patient,hi Lisa. I sorry.
760.0,Provider,"I hear you I can't Oh, there you are hi."
17224.0,Patient,Nice to meet you as well.
760.0,Provider,"Okay well i'm looking forward to working with you, I have some questions that I want to ask you. The whole point is going to be to kind of get to know what what's going on with you and look looking for areas that you might want to work on, but before we get started heather if you can just let me know what it is you're hoping to get out of therapy, of being here."
17224.0,Patient,"You know, to be honest with you i've struggled with mental health so long, I have probably a super long list. And I think the biggest thing is, I would love to fill some normalcy and because I haven't felt normal seen a really long time so that's probably the The one thing that like where I could just get up and go to work and. Like everybody else is doing, you know."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so talk to me about your mental health what what are you struggling with right now, what are what are some of the symptoms would have been diagnosed with what are you going through with when in that in that area."
17224.0,Patient,"um, to be honest with you, I have not been properly diagnosed I guess um. Other than. My depression and that was just with my regular family doctor. And, most recently it's been I haven't been diagnosed but i'm pretty sure and dealing with ptsd. and definitely anxiety and panic attacks and severe I been struggling through the anxiety for. A really long time, but more so where it's debilitated me from living like a normal you know getting up going to work and taking the kids to school type thing for. Almost four years now, and that was after the death of one of my children and at the same time I had twins and the other was in the nick you for a very long time, and he still suffers. from medical conditions that are really scary for me so that's kind of remain anxiety took off exponentially and just kind of took over my world."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so you have these symptoms prior to this happening, but since this accident was it a maximum of some sort."
17224.0,Patient,"So. I was pregnant with twins and they had a medical condition, while in the womb, and so I I lost one. To 27 weeks and then actually i'm sorry. He passed about 25 weeks, and then we delivered at 27 weeks. My living son and he spent a little over three months in the nick you and then he still has chronic lung disease, so he has a lot of stuff. That you know a lot of specialists that he still sees and he had a couple of other things that have kind of results, since then, but he's still pretty medically needy."
760.0,Provider,How old is he.
17224.0,Patient,he's he'll be four on the 11th.
760.0,Provider,So um so are you currently taking medication to manage these any of these symptoms that you're struggling with.
17224.0,Patient,"Well, I was taking for many years, I was taking paxil. And that never took away all of the issues that I was having and I attempted. and add ons like abilify. And there was another one I cant cannot remember I i've tried many different antidepressants and that helped some symptoms but not others. And, most recently, I was switched over to zoloft. And while on zoloft I had. Panic attacks so bad that I had to go to the hospital, I thought it was having a heart attack. or something like that and that. And I was also on hydroxyl xen for the anxiety because my physician will not prescribe. xanax or klonopin or any of those types of medications and so once I started with you guys at bright heart and I started a week ago well actually it was on this Monday with. monique the PA and she gave me lexapro and a short supply of klonopin so i'm currently taking those."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, any it's probably too soon to know what kind of relief you're going to get from those i'm guessing too soon to tell."
17224.0,Patient,"I so there has been no adverse effects which i'm very happy with, because I was nervous after what happened with the zoloft that um it would spike I was honestly. I can't even explain to you how out of control, I felt that I couldn't even handle myself and with having young children it's that's very scary um. But I so far i'm i'm feeling what I feel when i'm not taking any medication, so I still have the depression there's still anxiety there, and you know bad thoughts, you know negativity mainly. And so yeah i'm still not sure. How still waiting to see."
760.0,Provider,How about a family history with mental health issues.
17224.0,Patient,"Yes, yes um my I don't know much about my father's side he's wasn't in my life, but my mother has. she's bipolar ADHD and I, and I don't know if it's bipolar depression or what that she's dealt with, but she has. dealt with mental health issues, for a long time."
760.0,Provider,"All right, um. talk to me about any childhood experiences any you say you say you have ptsd was that only with the the experience with your son's. When they were born or. or when you were pregnant with them, or is it before that too."
17224.0,Patient,"um well I wasn't a very physically and mentally abusive relationship. gosh it's been. 1819 years ago now, but that's when I first experience symptoms of ptsd like the night terrors the scene this person after I left and was able to get away, but just seeing him and other people. And after that I developed a lot of anger that I didn't have previously, so I can have carried that on over to other."
760.0,Provider,Relationships how old were you when when you were involved in this abusive relationship.
17224.0,Patient,I was 21.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so you were young."
17224.0,Patient,"Okay yeah and for a little over two years. But I think so I just I considered it myself ptsd years later, and that carried on for a few years, but it wasn't anything that stopped me from living my life, you know I still worked I had friends, I you know socialized all those things and. The reason why I consider what I have now ptsd is because I i've now developed car sickness. anytime i'm going outside of if i'm if i'm driving I don't but i'm extremely anxious when i'm the driver, but if i'm a passenger I have curse sickness, so I have to take. can't drama mean you know that over the counter. Yes, medicine, I have to take that or benadryl something to relax me and i'm constantly playing backseat driver, which is really annoying a fiance but um I especially if we're going to San Francisco because that's where my son. was born and where all the appointments took place with the babies and. I I honestly it's so hard for me to make that that drive that track, a lot of his appointments now his dad has to take him to on his own. Because i'm more of a basket case and have no help and it like on the way to an appointment and. I will get nauseous and end up actually vomiting or having some type of digestive issues. or not digestive i'm sorry like bell issues and they come on like immediately it's not even something that that builds up it just all of a sudden, is there and so i'm just a very nervous person all the time now i'm always afraid of the next bad thing that's going to happen."
760.0,Provider,"I mean, and you didn't have you didn't have any childhood. Did you have any childhood abuse any difficulty in childhood or it's all started at 21 with."
17224.0,Patient,"um no actually my mother and we she was a single mom we did not get along and I don't know if it would. I mean back in the 80s, when I was growing up, we you know where it was normal to be spanked or to have to go pull a switch off the tree and get swatted or get hit with the belt or um but my mom being a single mom and she was very particular about the warehouse had to be and. per night never to this day, our relationship is strained um but she was in and out of relationships constantly with different men and a lot of them were bad relationships, and so I was. witness to a lot of. A lot of fights and a lot of just negativity. That was a lot of verbal fighting between her and her boyfriend at the. Time yes. And I mean my home I we always had a home, we always had food, clothing, you know it wasn't that. We we were not stable in our home, but my mom's emotionally was just very turbulent and we always fought and and I actually. came pregnant with my first child at. 13. And I had an abortion and a year later, I became pregnant with my second and I he's now 25."
760.0,Provider,and your relationship with him.
17224.0,Patient,"Unfortunately, that poor kid is just like me. he's very emotional and. No he's amazing actually our relationship is wonderful and he's a great kid, but I see a lot of my anxiety and worry that has transferred into him. But I my mother did send me to counseling when I was a child, but I. I remember only going to one session and the counselor at the time, told my mom that the problem was not me that it was her. And I remember my mom pulled me out of that. That setting and didn't take me back she was very upset about that and. Excuse me. But I know that i've always been an emotional kid i've never I, to this day, and this is a, this is a habit I would love to break but i'm 41 and I still can't break it and I love to sleep during the day and be awake all night long. and Obviously, with children that's extremely hard to do. But."
760.0,Provider,i've been doing. Since I was in it. So what since you were a kid is that during the tend to develop did you develop that when your mom was dating all these different guys.
17224.0,Patient,"um I I just remember never wanting bedtime always wanting to be up, but of course I had to go to bed, and always having a very hard time waking up for school. And and. Even with energy as a little kid just not. always being late for everything and still to this day, that is me i'm always late for everything, no matter how hard I try and I lose a lot of jobs, even."
760.0,Provider,"Once i'm very good. I do not think you were late for this appointment, or if you were you know you weren't late for this appointment, no. No, I."
17224.0,Patient,"And you know what it's The sad thing about, that is, it takes a lot of planning ahead of time, a lot of prodding. Myself um, but we are not physically meeting if we were physically meeting, because this is a zoom call it's a lot easier yeah um so I just I always get a lot of anxiety before I have to do almost anything and."
760.0,Provider,Then code out inside the House as well as outside the House okay.
17224.0,Patient,"it's in the past few years, since my child, since we lost our child I I get anxiety, sometimes with even the kids is noises or if it's a lot of chaos, just like making dinner. Okay."
760.0,Provider,So you how many kids do you have you said you have the 25 year old and a four year old do you have any other kids.
17224.0,Patient,yeah the five year old and he lives on his own and then I have an eight year old daughter. And a four year old son.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, all right."
17224.0,Patient,yeah.
760.0,Provider,And and how's your relationship your current relationship with us at a husband.
17224.0,Patient,um well I guess. fiance yeah it's 17 years of fiance.
760.0,Provider,Okay. So you've been together living in the same household for 17 years okay.
17224.0,Patient,"yeah on and off I we've had our moments, but but we've always we've been in each other's lives for 17 years yeah okay."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, and is it a good relationship, how would you characterize it."
17224.0,Patient,"um he will, over the years, my mental health has put a big strain on our relationship we did split up when our our eight year old was a year old because I went through a lot of I guess postpartum. lot and I did get off of my medication at the time for the pregnancy, because I did fear what am I do to her, so of course afterwards it just kind of snowballed and. And so we split up for almost two years but we're we're really good at co parenting. So we co parenting and then we decided to try again and then. We had an oops pregnancy and that's where our four year old comes in. And we've just we worked it out, I think, as we're getting older he's understanding, more than a lot of the things that I. Experience or bring to the table is not something that i'm trying to bring and."
760.0,Provider,Then it's something that's difficult for you and you're trying to overcome it but it's hard for you.
17224.0,Patient,"he's understanding that right. Yes, yes, along a lot of years of that. That he's more he's not so much of an emotional person. he's more of a logical person and let's just you know. So he's very structured he wakes up the same time, every day, you know, like his routine is consistent and. he's just very stable and i'm kind of we always joke that i'm like kind of the hippie that doesn't have a clock."
760.0,Provider,Because I.
17224.0,Patient,Just don't you know. it's hard for me to conform to things. And so I would love to be able to get back to work.
760.0,Provider,So when was it the last time you worked and what did you do.
17224.0,Patient,"I was actually I was working two jobs, I I was a cna. And I also was working for property management i've been doing property management for many years. And I actually lost my property management job because of my. My showing up times and it's once i'm there i'm great but it's getting there on time that has been my biggest problem for so many years. and"
760.0,Provider,And how old were you do you think when the depression and the mental health stuff you know you have any kind of a sense as to what your age was.
17224.0,Patient,"um I think that i've always. Even as a child, I remember. I remember odd things like when we got in the car to go somewhere i'd have to check to make sure that my eyelashes are still attached to my eyes. And I never I mean back then I just thought that was I didn't think nothing of it but i'm. Also, always been insecure very insecure person and. I hate my hands I hate the sight of my hands for my reflection in the mirror, so those were little things that. That I just remember as being a kid and then my mom was kind of abusive mentally."
760.0,Provider,"And maybe she put you down she young or old, how would you characterize."
17224.0,Patient,She would put me down a lot and. Her way of making up for stuff was to buy me gifts so. yeah a lot of she took out her I see I see it now is she took out on me what she was going through herself she didn't really get. Good help mental health help until I was out of the House.
760.0,Provider,And did did you have any siblings.
17224.0,Patient,"Yes, I have a brother, and we are 10 years apart, so he was 30."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so. Okay, so there was a good period of time that he you are in the House with your mom but he was not there."
17224.0,Patient,"Yes, yes, and once he was there, he was the golden child he still is and and unfortunately i'm. His for well not unfortunately for him his experience with growing up with my mom is a lot different than mine, because my mother was. She had a very bad will a surgery basically that went wrong when my brother was about 10 years old and after that my mom slowed down her life, she pretty much she did date a couple of men after. i'm with my brother around but it's her life just slowed down and she really focused on my brother and his well being so she changed drastically, in that sense. But we still don't yeah Unfortunately, we have a really hard time she's like a big support to me, sometimes, but my mom's very controlling and she wants. things done her way and so when she starts to do that to me I pull back, and I have it's really easy for me to not talk to her for months, at a time, and that makes me sad because that's my mom but um. And it's especially been strained more so because of coven because we have different views, obviously what the child that has severe lung disease i'm a lot more. aware of."
760.0,Provider,When he.
17224.0,Patient,"yeah yes and my my mom baby sits for my brother and my brother believes that covert is fake and they don't they're not, they will not be vaccinated they. they'll say hurtful things like well our children are healthy. and And so that's put a huge strain on our relationship and I have not. physically been alone with my mother, other than when my grandmother was in the hospital and recently in almost two years, so my main support is my fiance."
760.0,Provider,"Okay i'm feeling not really close to the brother now because of this whole cogan do you think, do you think you're feeling anxious they think the pandemic because of your son's condition, do you think it's added to your stress and to your anxiety."
17224.0,Patient,"Yes, yes."
760.0,Provider,Fair they're.
17224.0,Patient,"very, very, very much, so I think before my reprieve would be as silly as it sounds, but my reprieve would be. To go grocery shopping in the evening alone or to target alone and that would give me some time away from the kids and to be you know heather for a little while and and now I do all of my shopping online or I do pick up I rarely go to. Two in indoor places. And we're i'm homeschooling my eight year old right now and and that actually we're all home my fiance also works from home and he just started going into the Office two days a week, so. So we're all home together, which was great in the beginning, but."
760.0,Provider,Probably gotten all all these months later.
17224.0,Patient,"It really has because. I. was forced and when my daughter was going to school, I was forced to get up get dressed take her to get her dress take her to school. Now it's relaxed and I don't have that structure and dad being home, I know that I have let go of a lot and kind of put things on him a lot more and kind of sunk back into my own little cave you know my own little hole, I guess, which I think has added to. The negativity and and you know the I don't know how to explain it just I don't have a good structure. and"
760.0,Provider,"Lack of you know you're there with your kids you're there with your fiance but you're isolated. Yes, and lack of structure which is. not good for the other symptoms, that your other mental health issues that you're dealing with. So it's it's all been really difficult for you. yeah yeah okay all right So what do you do as a hobby or as an as maybe a coping skill now with with everything going on with goal, that is, is there anything that you have that you do. Currently, that helps you cope or."
17224.0,Patient,"And I. not really I normally. have something that. I go to. Whether it's. Like I I love essential oils, so I always and i'm big on how my house looks and smells and fills and so i'm big on you know, making sure that those things are in order and going well. But i've kind of lost interest in the things that even were important to me. In the past year or so so mosaic."
760.0,Provider,Oh.
17224.0,Patient,"I don't listen I love music and I don't listen to it much I I just not really into the the oils and I bought a cry cut during the pandemic it's like a. where you can make shirts and different things like that um and I haven't done much with that. I just I do a lot of arts and crafts, with the kids I do a lot of. Like hobbies with them their interests. I lately it's been, what can I find to do during the pandemic where they're still feeling like they have some normalcy so. I took him to three different pumpkin patches this year because it's outdoors and it's a little bit safer, you know. And I love to be out in nature, so. We visited you know, several like like will drive up to sonora. I don't know if you're where you're at but we're it's kind of like in the mountains, where we are in, and just kind of walk around and the trees and. Find pine cones you know stuff like that, but it's all centered around them, I. And I guess that that makes me feel good to for them to be happy so they're my hobby."
760.0,Provider,"And again, it gets you out of your your your home. Yes, doing things and that's good okay all right all right, well, we see looking down Oh, if you have any history or current substance use or abuse in your life that you can. That you can remember that's been a problem, maybe I don't know or not."
17224.0,Patient,"yeah I was a smoker for since from the age of about 15 is when I started until just before actually just when I found out, I was pregnant with my twins. And I finally quit. Also, but other than that I addicted to soda, so I think food really and it will you know. I always laugh, but, in all honesty it's it's been a really it's been really bad for my health and I do notice that i've cut back tremendously since my panic attacks, because I read that caffeine can induce them so i've tried. Yes, yes, so i've tried my best to cut back on that because my weight I is not ideal, or anywhere near and. I have a lot of aches and pains all over my body all the time so that really is my biggest thing is, you know being reliant on happiness with. soda."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, all right and talk to me about what you already talked about your sleep but talk to me about your exercise habits outside of these walks in the in the nature and such anything that you do."
17224.0,Patient,"Now, stretching I do stretching for sciatica but. I don't have. The structure to do that or the interest I I used to I used to exercise all the time, I used to go to the gym, but I just don't have the interest now to do it, of course, now in this and it's even harder. Because, where do you really go and be safe, but I think I. mean my fiance don't take personal time for ourselves. We you know we're either the only time he has a way is when he's hiding in his office room or you know after that work together and put the kids and then the kids and the kids. So my my exercises when I take them out on their bikes."
760.0,Provider,"All right, well that's exercising is really good to a coping skill for anxiety, you probably already know that. Does that give you any kind of motivation to at least take a walk. At some point during the day, or something simple. Maybe. push ups sit ups those kinds of things that you said you have sciatica so I don't know how much physically, you might be limited."
17224.0,Patient,"yeah I so oddly since i've cut back on my caffeine my pain level has went down. A lot and so it's a lot easier to. To get out, but I also have a well a side of me that I don't really talk about so it's even probably more expensive, but I hate the daylight I. I for since I, and I can tell you it's been since I was 25 years old and that's when I had my first big. Mental break i'm where I. I. I guess it, I had a lot, I had a lot of acne when I was younger, so I have a lot of scarring on my skin and it's made me even more self conscious, so I don't like to be outside during the daylight, so I have to build myself up. and I guess that's what I would call it to to actually. go out and take the kids out during the day, so that takes a lot of energy and effort. To get ready and get out the door."
760.0,Provider,"Which is nice, so you have some body issues with. With the with the You said the scarring and you said something about your hands earlier before. And there was something else, no that was it."
17224.0,Patient,"Well, actually i'm losing all of my hair so that's another huge um."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so somebody issues body image issues."
17224.0,Patient,"Big time. So it does make it hard for me to to get out there and I. Once I go i'm Okay, but the anxiety build up to get there it's exhausting and so it's a lot of times it's easier for me to not but some days I feel really great and i'm like let's go kids we're going to go on this, you know and we'll go and then the next day it's almost like. I ran a marathon the day before and i'm completely exhausted and I don't want to get out of bed."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, because this may be part of the reason, all this anxiety to build up to get out during the daylight, is that maybe part of the reason that you struggled being on time for appointments and in the past work was that the reasoning, why you were late."
17224.0,Patient,um.
760.0,Provider,Is there a correlation there.
17224.0,Patient,that's a good question. No actually no because before that the body issues. were really triggered I was still late. A lot to. A lot of things okay.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so where's your pain level now, you said it's better now because you Patrick caffeine, but where's your pain level now. With your site is there any other issues. Beyond the psychiatric issues. and pain and health."
17224.0,Patient,"yeah I have a lot of neck. neck and. back pain and. I think a lot of it has to do with being a cna and doing a lot of the you know the physical work of of being a cna and I when I was younger, of course, they just didn't take care of my. My back like I should have, and so I have a lot of. aches and pains from that the sciatica when it's flared up it's in my legs and it is a whole nother level but um so I was on ibuprofen and in muscle relaxer for like about the past six months. But. Right now, I don't have any of that in my legs oddly I. And I don't even know if it it almost made me wonder is this psychological because I went to a neurologist. Because I had numbness in my. My leg, and so we were going to check, you know, to see if it was nerve related and after that appointment he used some machine where they like. zap your nerves to test them and, shortly after that appointment I didn't really have that numbness. anymore and and then shortly after that my my legs weren't is in so much pain anymore, but I know that I have like vertebrae that are. dislocated i've been to a chiropractor a few times, and so I know that I know that I have alignment issues and whatnot. But my pain level, I would say. Probably like around three or four. yeah and I know weight has a lot to do with that you know my knees hurt. And I also have very irregular periods, so when it's time for my period, like a week before the week during the week after I have a lot of. issues in in that you know, like in my ovaries I have assist in my ovaries and stuff like that, so I have a lot of pain and stuff from those okay."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, all right so that's a lot of stuff okay."
17224.0,Patient,"All right, why are."
760.0,Provider,You what.
17224.0,Patient,"i'm sorry I am I, avoid the doctor so i've actually built several appointments to go to the gynecologist because of my anxiety and. and yeah so."
760.0,Provider,"I out the door, you have to you have to build up and be on time and get out the door to that. yeah and that's huge and that's actually what started me on the zoloft."
17224.0,Patient,"And the hydroxyl xen was, I called the doctor and I said, you know you're referring me to be specialists and I really want to get to these appointments, but I can't and that's also hard to admit to people, so you just kind of push it away. And you know and try to ignore it, you know, and I said that's when he put me on the hydroxyl scene and I. I know that xanax has worked for me in the past. And, and I asked for that and that's, then you always from the clinics that i've been going to for over a decade, they don't prescribe narcotics or anything like that. And i'm like is there any way that you can just you know, give me for emergency uses, so I can get these appointments because I really trying but it's hard, and on top of you know my children's appointments and keeping up with those things so. But yeah."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, all right that's that's a whole lot that you're dealing with so all right, so what i'd like to start, perhaps going over with you would be. Maybe some mindfulness exercises maybe working with your thinking and your emotions and how they kind of correlate. Does that does that sound like something that would be helpful to you."
17224.0,Patient,"yeah actually so my daughter, I have a couple of mindfulness books for her. So we have done some I have done meditation in the past."
760.0,Provider,"Well mindfulness can be meditation but it doesn't have to be people a lot of people confuse that they think mindfulness is meditation and you can do mindful meditation, but you can do other things that are not meditations that are also that are mindful. Okay, so. So maybe maybe reading some of those books, with your daughter would be I I know you that's a motivation for you. Maybe that would kind of help get you started in that because mindfulness is really good a good coping skill to deal with anxiety. kind of goes together, really, really well. So maybe we could start some of those exercises. And i'd like. You know and get started on that next time. Okay, that sounds good."
17224.0,Patient,"yeah yeah that sounds great. Okay, believe it and open. To try and do. Whatever I can it's. A mission."
760.0,Provider,"yeah it's it's it's I know it's an effort to break out of routine, but when we get anxious it's you know we were having these negative thought patterns, maybe some beliefs about ourselves. Which is feeding a negative emotion anxiety could be depression, could be a lot of things and it's it creates this. Then it leads us to behave in a certain way, like the avoidance stuff that you talked about, and then all of that it's just keeps building and building. And the more you think it and feel it and then behave in the way that's avoidance you're just reinforcing the anxiety. you're believing in it, building it ruminating in it and it just keeps going and going and going and so breaking out of that pattern i'm going to. You know, changing behaviors and I know it's hard for you, I know it's motivation for you so we'll go from the motivation, where we can perhaps you can pull out some of those those meditation or mindfulness books, with your daughter and start that as part of her it's good for her to good."

17224.0,Patient,"um i've never been in a group so i'm i'm actually to be honest with you i'm really excited about all of this because i've reached out. To my doctor before to ask to be referred to therapy counseling but because of my insurance i've always been told there really isn't anything.
