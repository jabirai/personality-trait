But they haven't told me the day or anything for an interview which i'm nervous about. So I know yesterday was a holiday. it's probably why I haven't heard back from them, but. This is my first after all the resumes the i'll all applications, I feel that the only one that got back to me was a hostess job but that's Okay, because I really haven't worked in a while.

705.0,Provider,"Is it in time, then you feel good and you get off of it, and then you start the process again."
3683.0,Patient,"No, I just well yeah sometimes there's gaps, where it kind of runs its course. um. But that takes for me like a while, and if it does happen to like run out or something or if I don't feel the effects from it, then i'll either stop taking and i'll. start taking St john's wort and then stop taking a St john's where I go back on Prozac I kind of get the same effect from both of those."
705.0,Provider,"mm hmm okay. yeah so trying, then the medication, it seems to be working. yeah quite well that has to feel good."
3683.0,Patient,yeah does definitely.
705.0,Provider,yeah yeah. Especially right now with the job market and trying to get out there and just filling with that you know.
3683.0,Patient,yeah it helps definitely. yeah I think the last time that we had spoken. digit that ever that personality test ever come through.
705.0,Provider,"I i'm glad you're bringing it up and i'm going to check again my earlier this morning here's here's how I left to run when when you and I talked again I said look redness I think you've requested this is the third if not fourth time. yep please share with me because I get sent to carry Oh, is one of our websites and the other is pulse. And so I go over where it where I know that it's supposed to be and it's not there. So I he wrote an inquiry as I shared and then I received back that I should be able to view it on my end I share it again, I cannot do it on my end and the last they leave it and I want to make sure, before I don't misquote. I believe was they took it up to the CEO. Let me just see if I can scroll up here run. Okay, I was."
3683.0,Patient,Bad Have you had requests for to view that before from other patients of yours.
705.0,Provider,"Yes, and I know exactly where to go for some reason it's not showing up on my end they're showing that it is there. So i'm asking them to please help me out because, if I can't get it on my end. to share with me a copy or something where you and I can go over it. So I want you to know right i'm not. Your request or not being. i'm hearing your request and i'm putting them yeah."
3683.0,Patient,I totally get it.
705.0,Provider,"Oh here is the last one let's see. Sorry i'm scrolling through the different increase. let's see run. If it's finished and completed it goes to the bottom, so that's what i'm checking to see. And i'd asked your care navigator. To check and see for me. So the last on here was a reach out and that reach out was from the care navigator and that care navigator than reached out. So that was CAP Kathleen K selling. Have you ever talked to Kathleen. nope okay so Kathleen is what we call your care navigator. Okay yeah so, then they reached out to our program developer, and then it even went to the highest level, so at this point what I can see is that it's it's still there i'm still waiting, which doesn't help you."
3683.0,Patient,"Know next time, maybe."
705.0,Provider,"I. Well, again, my apologies, I. know that."
3683.0,Patient,I was just I kept I keep thinking about that.
705.0,Provider,"I now and we had a tab that says personality and when I go in there it's just like no personality available i'm like come on now, but I don't want to make any more excuses for him because i'm at a loss for words I don't know what's going on."
3683.0,Patient,A technical thing.
705.0,Provider,"I know I know and it's just like. i've done breathing why looking into it again be like okay. I will send another inquiry, and you know with that I know you're interested in it, I wanted to see to because I know that that's one thing that you've requested and we haven't been able to fulfill that, and you know."
3683.0,Patient,that's okay.
705.0,Provider,"yeah I wanted to check in though too, because I know what the surveys is I also am able to review the surveys and it looks like in quality of service that there may be some things that you feel like that you're needing that you're not getting."
3683.0,Patient,well.
705.0,Provider,"Is that one of them. No, no, no."
3683.0,Patient,"Not at all, not at all the technical thing I just i'm. All of last week, I had to go to three. group classes and it really has to do with just my medication. Because I know that. If if I be if I go to the classes and basically i'm only getting eight pills for the buprenorphine. And the very it's just a short it's only for four days. So I. Every time that I call in to try to figure out what do I need to do to get a regular prescription there isn't any direction."
705.0,Provider,"I can take care on my end what i'm looking at is what's called your care intensity frequency. Okay, and so a lot of times like let's say if you miss an appointment, then the care frequency. let's say in a month if you're supposed to meet weekly you meet weekly in your groups and then you do twice a month that's what you're on right now. i'm actually yeah weekly group therapy twice a month individual so in the month if you don't attend the weekly, then the care intensity shows that there was it was you know some error, there are it wasn't met. When it's not met a lot of times with that it's tied to the medication that they give you sometimes you might have heard the word the bridge budget medication. yeah yeah so what I can do, if you like, on the care intensity I can manually change that instead of attending group every week to change it to less."
3683.0,Patient,Yes.
705.0,Provider,"That way you're meeting that care intensity and it should help be able to share where, then you can get your medications more regularly."
3683.0,Patient,Okay yeah that would be awesome.
705.0,Provider,What do you feel right now would still be supportive. What I mean as instead of weekly coming into group do you feel like twice a month would be beneficial still.
3683.0,Patient,"yeah let's try twice a month and then to twice to talk to you. Okay, so two groups and then to two of you."
705.0,Provider,"So I am doing this right now why we're talking, and so I have I just put care intensity information is an accurate because we're changing it for your support. Okay twice a month is for the group therapy and then twice a month as for individual therapy. And then they usually do two for the drug screening. Okay that's usually have you been doing quarterly."
3683.0,Patient,I only did the the one drug test once.
705.0,Provider,i'll cry.
3683.0,Patient,And that was two weeks ago.
705.0,Provider,Okay.
3683.0,Patient,Should I be getting something in the mail soon.
705.0,Provider,"For you, to be able to take your test. yeah Okay, I thought I saw something of that too, so let me see so that'll be the next thing i'll look into to see if we can help rectify the the medication. i'm going to put in quarterly right now for the drug testing, but if they need more it might switch back to monthly. And let's save and close that so now, when I go in and I read your care intensity so when you let's say the virtual clinics that you're out of compliance, you can share with them that it's been changed, as of today, which is October the 12th. They would be to review. Twice a month for your groups twice a month for individual appointments. A quarterly is what we set the drug screening. Now let me open back up to see. Was it the drug testing that you were trying to go and at the times because of code there wasn't enough people."
3683.0,Patient,"Yes, but then, when I actually was on. When I opened it with somebody in compliance at the care navigator. I had a it's a home test. The whole time I didn't realize that I thought that I had to take my urine sample and then go take it to quest, but I could have just I just did it at home."
705.0,Provider,"So great so then that's cleared up were there, the home test they're not asking you to go to a site. Right okay."
3683.0,Patient,it's a home test.
705.0,Provider,"yeah i'll cloud. And just to let you know, too, because I see another increase in here about your personality test, this is gone through. blaine. blaine said directing Angela any because I wrote writer review documents and pulsing carrier can't see your personality test, please advise. It went to and Angelina for further assistance for the outcomes, then it went into sending it to halina and halina is our bright heart health for the mental health. side and substance abuse the director so, then the director is involved now and then it went into john, which is the CEO and he's working on the project and. Unfortunately results may not be accessible. Right now, and I put back that I had checked."
3683.0,Patient,overhyped wow.
705.0,Provider,It is on the radar.
3683.0,Patient,It is definitely on the radar.
705.0,Provider,"Yes, so the medication and pieces i'm hearing you so you can't go, just like. 14 days and then pick it up 14 days you're needing more of a consistent and a more pills basically."
3683.0,Patient,"Right so she's been giving me eight helps so I, I have to go get my prescription every four days."
705.0,Provider,mm hmm.
3683.0,Patient,"And it's it's Okay, but it would just be so much easier because now, you know my lamictal I don't need to get that that often. Because I just. I take it that that goes for a whole month and then well I you know it doesn't really matter I mean I can do it once a week. Just every four days it's just. Tough."
705.0,Provider,"And that is what starts to happen is when you have a no show, and the last 15 days and multiple over 30 days and they reduce the prescription to four days with the second bridge to the next appointment."
3683.0,Patient,Right okay.
705.0,Provider,"And then, it says instruct patient must attend 15 days without a no show for scripts to be increased. And then i'm looking right now, at your attendance just to see. The last no show on here that I see was on 10 one."
3683.0,Patient,"For the Group. Sometimes I don't go to the group. Yes, it's I don't I don't know I don't really. get much benefit out of it, I know that it's healthy because, obviously, there are many people that are going through what i'm going through."
705.0,Provider,mm hmm.
3683.0,Patient,But I think it's it I just get shy and nervous so Sometimes I get freaked out about the group.
705.0,Provider,I would say run that that's normal where you've changed groups to and you're getting to know new people they're getting to know you.
3683.0,Patient,yeah yeah that's true there's a couple. A couple faces on there that i'm obviously familiar with.
705.0,Provider,mm hmm.
3683.0,Patient,So that's true.
705.0,Provider,I work with one group it's another one is chantel or 12 o'clock and it shifted were a lot of people change because we're conflicts and school conflicts and no one knew one another. And we would have like 1215 people with nobody's saying anything.
3683.0,Patient,that's hard. It is.
705.0,Provider,"However, trust level and rapport is being built. And so now we're having more and more people are beginning to feel safe to. speak up and to share what's going on. i'm hoping the same then can happen for you."
3683.0,Patient,"yeah I just always I don't know I think it's it could be, because I, I just have a tendency to be shy. Especially I would prefer to listen over being over talking or expressing my feelings, I like to hear other people, and I mean the only thing. That I do share when it comes, like my time to talk are really just like inspirational quotes. Because I it's hard for me to. I don't know talk to not I guess strangers, but they're not really strangers because we're all in the same together. It just makes me nervous."
705.0,Provider,If and when you feel more comfortable. Even sharing what you just said i've had people on group that have been just like what you're sharing. i'm nervous about this this isn't me but i'm going to speak today and i'm just going to put that out there.
3683.0,Patient,yeah.
705.0,Provider,I can just be like you know what that's it for today that's my that's my one.
3683.0,Patient,yeah.
705.0,Provider,"You can utilize to if it's more of let's say we're talking building steps you know those smaller steps use the chat and if you feel comfortable if someone's share something, and you relate, or you want to show some support type in something to the chat."
3683.0,Patient,"Oh that's a good idea yeah i've had a couple people respond, but I never responded back to them, I because I just like I said I I like to listen i'm a good person that just listen. um but yeah I think the chat that would be. That would be a good thing."
705.0,Provider,"yeah they're all tools right and and they are not, he said, a different level of what their comfort zone is and part of groups, sometimes it's just getting there and showing up. And being willing to just listen people need a hero mouth."
3683.0,Patient,yeah yeah that's true.
705.0,Provider,"And you're still getting a benefit of practicing being accountable and all those other things that comes to it. How, which are you, and now the group. Yes, okay. And that's still working for you."
3683.0,Patient,"it's it's pretty good it's with Julie and she's she's good she's gentle. she's a good she's a good, you know personal list to that it's a full is a pretty full Class two."
705.0,Provider,Do you think that's a factor also is one is so full and then already you're you're having reservations about speaking up and then it's almost like a justifies it's like there's so many people here.
3683.0,Patient,yeah definitely well I I took a class last week on Tuesday and there were just two other people. which was an interesting class that we didn't really do I would prefer to have a lot of people in the class.
705.0,Provider,Car.
3683.0,Patient,"I think it's it's so much easier because the smaller people in the class that it's it may be even more nervous because I knew I would have to. be giving a lot of myself to fill fill the class, you know."
705.0,Provider,"see what works for you sometimes what ends it, it can work the opposite to just share it i'm feeling anxious, and this is where I am today. yeah i'm just going to do my best of of. What i'm going to share."
3683.0,Patient,Just let it go.
705.0,Provider,"yeah sometimes with anxiety it's, the more you try to contain it and to you know oh i'm worried about this, and now the more the anxiety builds where sometimes it's helpful, just to be like you know what. i'm feeling anxious and i'm going to let you know that i'm going to i've had people i've worked with said, you know what they went to a job interview, and they said hi i'm so and so can you give me a minute i'm having a panic attack. deep breath. And it turned out that that person actually knew a lot about panic attacks, because I think they also relate it. yep cow, so you never you never know. Right yeah."
3683.0,Patient,just go for it.
705.0,Provider,"yeah so I see them that your next group will be it says fifth the 15th of this month, which will be Friday 10am. Yes, and then there's on. Which is Monday I see a 4pm peer support group or peer support."
3683.0,Patient,"Yes. And that is supposed to be for well, I wrote down the wellness coach. i'm not quite sure what. that's for. Because that will be with you right."
705.0,Provider,"It is what you did it looks like. On the on the sixth of last month, it says pure support and it looks like you did the clinical communication assessment. Okay, which I believe is what the personality test is that we're looking for. Yes, yes. And then i'm looking through your notes for peer support. And it says rap session. The rap session, I want to say is the one where it's different people in the group. And you just share like updates, but I want to see if I can find out a little bit more on this one."
3683.0,Patient,So that's for the 19th.
705.0,Provider,"Right, it says on the 19th at 4pm and it's a rap session. And then, again, you it on the 22nd go at 10am for your your group. Yes, okay. As long as now. So they're wanting to see you know the 15 days, no with no, no, no, shows it's hard to say. And then starting right now, then we'll have where you're going to do that twice a month. Yes, make sure to like I had someone that cancelled one and then both of their groups didn't fall within the same month, so if that happens to you, then it wouldn't be twice a month, you know if you've missed like. The 31st let's say is on Sunday let's say you do. A group, then, and it happened on the first well that wouldn't count for your October."
3683.0,Patient,Like it that okay.
705.0,Provider,"yeah so just you have a calendar, it looks like right there. yeah that would be perfect to just start circling maybe are highlighting, as you go to groups where you know you've met that."
3683.0,Patient,Right okay.
705.0,Provider,"Good and then you and I, if you like, can go ahead and schedule your next individual if that's okay."
3683.0,Patient,yeah perfect.
705.0,Provider,"And you and I met today. And so, if we can put in another one before the end of the month. And then you would meet that twice a month. Should I look for a Tuesday."
3683.0,Patient,yeah This seems to work.
705.0,Provider,"Quite, how do you feel about October the 26 That would be a Tuesday."
3683.0,Patient,that's perfect what time.
705.0,Provider,Let me pull that up going to the. I have on the 26 which is Tuesday ran I have it looks like a 430 and then I have 430 all the way until six o'clock.
3683.0,Patient,Okay let's do 430.
705.0,Provider,"or 30 it is so we're going to do 430 on October 26 i'm going to go ahead, while we're talking and do that one. takes a minute, for your stuff to come up. So this should help by doing this intensity and get you going here. So the we put that at 430. Okay, and it saved do you want be then renta also scheduled November or wait. Either okay so go ahead."
3683.0,Patient,"Okay, and Tuesday. Okay, any of the Tuesday."
705.0,Provider,Do you want me to look at the ninth.
3683.0,Patient,Yes.
705.0,Provider,November 9 and say the 23rd That way we kind of get in a groove of every other.
3683.0,Patient,That would be awesome.
705.0,Provider,"Great let me see to. So we said October the 26 at 430 is that normally a good time for you. may see then on November 9 at that that time is available. Okay, so November the ninth, if you like, I could do it a different time but I could also stick with the 430."
3683.0,Patient,let's do 430 on the next.
705.0,Provider,Perfect now i'm going to go into the 23rd. And this way when you and I meet we'll just plan it all out this way one less thing to to have to check off your list November 23 I have also for 30 or another time.
3683.0,Patient,let's do the 430.
705.0,Provider,"Okay, great. So awesome, so I will stick with that, then we have the 26th and ninth and the 23rd will the 26th of October ninth of November November 23 430. Yes, okay. Great. How is recovery life going for you."
3683.0,Patient,it's good obviously I haven't fell back I haven't relapsed or anything so.
705.0,Provider,You say that so gradually it's like that I.
3683.0,Patient,wish man yeah and I I don't. I don't really have cravings. Because the the medication just takes away the withdrawals.
705.0,Provider,mm hmm.
3683.0,Patient,So i'm feeling pretty good.
705.0,Provider,That is excellent news.
3683.0,Patient,yeah and even now better because I can feel the Prozac is kicking in.
705.0,Provider,"Right right oh. I know that you've been really dedicated to your recovery to finding a job to like all these other things, and even though the career has aligned just yet. it's Nice that you had an opportunity to get this other piece with your recovery and what. Is the mental health, where it's like okay this piece, I already have coming into this minute up. Yes, mm hmm."
3683.0,Patient,yeah I feel good. Good yeah.
705.0,Provider,"Do you do any outside support group meetings. nope Okay, do you feel that that's something that you're even interested in."
3683.0,Patient,um no I mean I feel like what I have going on with with you and the groups that I have gone to and we'll go to I feel like that. covers kind of that.
705.0,Provider,"If that's where you are in then it's like it's good you know you can always re evaluate and at any time, if you feel you know some type of support that you're wanting or so many like just resources that we have today."
3683.0,Patient,"yeah definitely. yeah yeah i've never really done anything like this, you know I mean in my life prior I mean I used to I used to drink So when I quit drinking. It would have been nice to have a support group, but I never thought to myself, it would be a good thing and I never fell back on, and I still haven't had alcohol like six years."
705.0,Provider,wow.
3683.0,Patient,"So I I feel like once i'm done with something I just didn't done with it. And nothing, no reason to go back to it because it's just a part of my life and life is, for me, my ultimate goal is to become wise when i'm old."
705.0,Provider,mm hmm.
3683.0,Patient,"So as many things that I can go through, and not keep falling back on other parts of my life that are old me the older me doesn't need to be now. The only thing I need to work on, is for tomorrow, how am I going to be for tomorrow."
705.0,Provider,mm hmm.
3683.0,Patient,"So yeah, this is the very first time i've ever had like a support, I mean i've had their be for many, many years but I never really looked at it as support, I always look I always have looked at therapy as more of an essential for mental health. Because. yeah you can have friends to talk to, but sometimes friends have ulterior motives."
705.0,Provider,They don't want to lose their drinking buddy can kind of dance. They don't want to look at themselves and so they're like please you know. Exactly yeah.
3683.0,Patient,"So i've always have had, I mean I started therapy like when I was 13 so there was gaps, when I didn't have it, but I always try to fall back on professionals, because you can. talk to your friends, but oftentimes it's easier to. just talk to the professionals, you know."
705.0,Provider,"It can be to that like you were saying that sometimes, maybe they have the influence that there's no ill intent but it ends up being."
3683.0,Patient,"angry right yeah i've learned the hard way, especially with having like female friends, where. I just have a hard time trusting females. I have a. I have i've got three sisters, so I get I understand females so. I don't i've never really. Had like a friend, that I can fully just talk to you about personal things you know. I guess my mom."
705.0,Provider,"Okay yeah sometimes you know mom knows knows as best and it's just nice to be able, you don't have to edit and you just put it out there, if you have that type of relationship."
3683.0,Patient,yeah yeah. yeah she's easy really easy to talk to because she's. she's not like me she's she wants she's always having fun always wants to have fun i'm a little bit more serious and. So it's it's nice having her i've always consider her like my best friend.
705.0,Provider,Oh that's that's good I. Sometimes you hear with families and it's very complicated and they you know a lot of times can't talk to their parents and you can.
3683.0,Patient,that's great yeah.
705.0,Provider,"yeah your part, that you said to with experience you know, and you want to be wiser and, as you move along and your journey. you're already like created this whole different path for yourself, or I would think that is you, you know being wiser learning from your experience being able just alone, the six years without alcohol. And yeah yeah and you continue to do it."
3683.0,Patient,"yeah I definitely fell off the wagon a little bit with. Doing like street drugs. Because I tried to just be a straight, as I can be in life so that was a bad time the whole. The whole thing was basically because. I was married and my partner and I. were just do drugs together. Basically."
705.0,Provider,"it's to where, if your brain and body and mind always go back to that because it's already based in your memory bank and it's again, where a slip can happen, and especially if you're in the relationship or, that is what you share. Now, moving forward, sometimes in life, we have to have to do things to figure out that that's not for us. Next relationship."
3683.0,Patient,Much better. yeah.
705.0,Provider,And I believe to that you said run that he's also in recovery that you guys are.

705.0,Provider,A car.
3683.0,Patient,I haven't really talked to them it's hard to talk to them because. She gets. Like drug induced schizophrenia really bad so it's he's like I really haven't talked to him since like the day I left him. And every day since it's just he's not even there. Which is sad. yeah but. he's just to confuse person I would I wanted him to be in recovery or really bad I mean i've. we've talked about it obviously when we're together like this is something that we both need to stop doing. But since i've been away from him I don't desire really to have that and i'm surprised that he's continuing on with that.
705.0,Provider,mm hmm.
3683.0,Patient,"You know, without me. So I don't know it's kind of strange."
705.0,Provider,"it's it's a tough one, because i'm first of all i'm glad that you got yourself out of the situation is, as you know, that's not healthy and it was easy to slip back because already that reward system is activated. yeah got yourself out safely, I now with him it's it's difficult because i'm sure you still care about them and you want the best."
3683.0,Patient,yeah definitely um but. That it was just a really bad relationship that.
705.0,Provider,She she disagreed.
3683.0,Patient,Her out. The whole time. yeah um. I don't know. he's lost out there somewhere. I can't help them. I feel like I. gave them way too much me.

3683.0,Patient,Because that's no it's not good.

3683.0,Patient,"yeah yeah. I honestly I don't know why why got so. wrapped up into it, you know. I don't know."
705.0,Provider,"wrapped up into the relationship or wrapped up into drug use, or something else."

3683.0,Patient,"yeah. yeah. yeah definitely kind of like the broken. man who needs help. that's what i've always kind of. fell into. And that's what i've it's, not that I. Always chose that but it's just kind of what i've I guess I did choose that."
705.0,Provider,"But this is a level, I know what you're talking about where it's it's not even unconsciously it's just all of a sudden, you reflect back and you're like oh hmm interesting."
3683.0,Patient,So yeah.
705.0,Provider,"i'm still doing the caretaking. Okay. With caretaking to I can be tied, and I think we talked a little bit about codependency and if that's some of the characteristics if you've taken like the list. Have you done the where there's the questionnaire. On no polka.org. I will send it to you. Just to see if you relate run and if you do, first of all there's always support group meetings but there's a questionnaire and it's basically just asking if you're codependent."

3683.0,Patient,Okay. Perfect you have mediums.
705.0,Provider,"they're they're the same anonymous space you're more than welcome and i'm it's Nice because it breaks it down into denial patterns low self esteem patterns control compliance avoidance. What you were talking about is seeing a pattern of who you choose to date. And and making that choice could be back to based on Oh, am I really codependent and if I get this managed. Would I have an opportunity to pick someone different from my next relationship. yeah so it asked the questions there. The website itself has some really good material. see what you think and then, if that is something you're interested, you and I can talk about that even a little bit more in our sessions."
3683.0,Patient,Okay yeah definitely.
705.0,Provider,Do would you say to i'm just thinking of some of the things that are usually come through they do you tend to be a people pleaser.
3683.0,Patient,and I do you like to please people. But it's not something that I. search out for. Something that I seek.
705.0,Provider,Do you feel like you can share with people the truth and you don't worry about hurting their feelings.
3683.0,Patient,Oh. It depends. It. depends.
705.0,Provider,"On quite as sometimes it's really closest like Okay, could it be called dependency, or is it just the situation depends."
3683.0,Patient,Right yeah.
705.0,Provider,Any difficulties with saying no.
3683.0,Patient,yeah for sure yeah.
705.0,Provider,"Okay yeah some of it, too, is just taking a look at it and seeing what you can gain."
3683.0,Patient,Okay.
705.0,Provider,"You were talking about to liking, to read quotes. yeah yeah looking to see I always have handy on my other desk here. i'm melody beattie how we talked about melody beattie before. No Okay, so this is called the language of letting go."
3683.0,Patient,All right.
705.0,Provider,"And so, each day it gives you. something to think about it gives you the quote of the day, and then something to think about so this one's called the language of letting go it's daily meditation some codependency. All right, and it's melody beattie and i'll send you a link to to her stuff. Sometimes I like to just read it, and it just gives me what I need it just has a way of knowing."
3683.0,Patient,How do you spell the BT.
705.0,Provider,be a. I eat. A little bit different BT.
3683.0,Patient,got that written down.
705.0,Provider,"So melody beattie. And like today is the 12th. let's just see by chance, what she writes about. So the 12 is being gentle with ourselves during times of grief, the process of adapting to change and loss takes energy. grief is draining sometimes exhausting some people need to cocoon for transformation and pet corns words, while going through grief grief, so he must be someone that writes on grief. We may feel more tired than usual or ability to function well in our areas of life may be reduced temporarily We may want to hide out in the safety of our bedroom grief is heavy it can wear us down and there's different types of groups. it's okay to be gentle with ourselves when we're going through change and greet yes, we want to maintain the disciplines of recovery, but we can be compassionate with ourselves, we do not have to expect more from ourselves, then we can deliver during this time. let's see. Then it goes into we may need more rest more sleep or more comfort, we may be more needy and have less to get it's okay to separate ourselves and our change needs during times of brief stress and change. it's okay to allow ourselves to cocoon during transformation, we surrender to the process and trust that a new exciting energy is being created within us before long. We will take wings and fly, and then it gives a quote at the bottom, and I know, sometimes is like it uses the word God, I asked it, you know if that's not something that you use to replace it with higher powers spiritual being or just sometimes people remove it. And they'll say just helped me set my change plans during times of grief change and loss."
3683.0,Patient,"that's excellent. very, very cool I have experienced some grief some severe grief when I worked at a clothing store for almost 11 years and my manager. She became like my mentor in life, she was the she was the buyer of the source, she was a professional buyer for neiman Marcus for like long time before I met her, but she. All the sudden was diagnosed with mesothelioma and she died a really painful deaths and I was there with her at the end and I saw her after and that was very hard for me. I think I was 26. Along those a really painful. Right after she. had left I basically took over her position at that business, so it was really hard, because my whole life was wrapped around. Her basically. Even though she was gone I tried. Really really hard to be. as successful as she was even though she had she had passed when she was 64 so I was no were even close to being to being able to wear her shoes, but I I tried for a really long time. I was very difficult."
705.0,Provider,"Very difficult to run to go to try to replace. Like it's the pressure, you were trying to put the pressure on yourself to fill in her shoes, while you're still mourning the loss. of her."
3683.0,Patient,"yeah and the the basically when the boss, the owner of the store. came and you know we used to travel together a lot of us to go to New York three times a year and stay in Vegas and La and. She sat me down one time and said. We have to like let you go like you need to go spread your wings go out and live, because what you've been doing now for 11 years is being other somebody else's life basically somebody else's position. And that was really hard, because I, I really didn't know anything other than that life."
705.0,Provider,mm hmm.
3683.0,Patient,"You know I worked six days a week, and I got to that store at nine in the morning and I left at six but I did it for so long. It was a really. Interesting I actually took after I left that that position that store I took a leave of absence and my doctor put me on disability. For like being burnt out basically."
705.0,Provider,"being burnt out, and you know, to have someone care about you, that much that saw so much more, even though you were it seems happy and content to be there, but they were like look I see so much potential that i'm gonna have to let you go."
3683.0,Patient,"yeah it was hard to because she. She had daughters that were my age, though little bit older than me um and so she always treated me like a like not her business partner, but more like a rough you know, a business daughter. Basically, so. It was like divorce that's the best way I can explain leaving that position, it was like a divorce, because my whole life was that. position that job."
705.0,Provider,"And that an identity that goes with it. at the right time. Right yeah, it is definitely you know, one of those things that you reflect back and go wow you know that was such an opportunity that you met her that you had that experience. And then you probably still have fond memories of like some of those learning opportunities. yeah yeah. If you have a boss like that, and you said you spent 11 years that makes sense."
3683.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
705.0,Provider,"yeah if it's a good match or not. This is exciting, you know, for a change, like why we're talking careers to that that maybe temporarily you go you check out what hosting would be like see if you like, it and just kind of okay i'm going to check it out."

3683.0,Patient,yeah definitely.
705.0,Provider,"If ever they do resurface you know i'm here by myself this year, you have your safety plan with like the crisis text line. yep cry. Again that's something that we definitely don't want to have you, you know be by yourself, thinking of those things."
3683.0,Patient,So I feel good I feel haven't thought of that in a while so. Okay yeah.
705.0,Provider,"Again, from what i'm hearing today. you're making a lot of progress you're getting yourself backwards, just like wow i'm feeling really good now and it's like this next action step is coming your way."
