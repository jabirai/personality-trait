ID,Role,Message
207.0,Provider,morning good morning. you're muted you're muted.
11622.0,Patient,"Sorry, it does that. automatically or something I don't know, thank you."
207.0,Provider,"yeah it does I haven't said. That everybody's muted when they first come in, especially I do it because of my group when people come in and they make a whole lot of commotion so I have to mute everybody up on entry."
11622.0,Patient,Oh okay.
207.0,Provider,"Like in your group, you see, you notice that you're muted it's because you we mute everybody up on entering because then people come in with a whole lot of commotion, especially if they come in late, so we meet them for how are you doing."
11622.0,Patient,"Okay, how are you doing."
207.0,Provider,"it's another day that I made it through both. How did everything go on from the last time that we met, I think the last time we had a really quick fashion, because you had a local going on with the sun."
11622.0,Patient,"yeah. I still have him like I have let his uh. His da DC him. supervised with me being there but um he's got a warrant out for us now and. I haven't heard from from him on a few days, and you know his visitations was yesterday, and you know this past weekend, and so I don't know if he's in jail, right now, or if he's just doesn't care and not trying to check on his kid I don't know so and then. A girlfriend. You know she was all like telling me everything and then she went back with him, did the couples counseling thing. And then cried wolf to me again. And then now she told me that I can't use anything that she told me against her and him in court i'm like sorry girlfriend you already told me I could. text."
207.0,Provider,"yeah exactly exactly so that day when we. When we spoke, I remember she had text you and saying that she wasn't able to be he's gonna leave or something like that or she's moving down and all that was going on with them. yeah easy easy, so there did he go by his mom."
11622.0,Patient,"i'm you know i'm not really sure she did get him evicted like the paperwork and stuff he's got to be out by the 10th, but I think she's back with him because she wouldn't tell me to not use that stuff in court if she wasn't back with him or helping him, you know. But I told her on the phone I told her this on the phone that I don't want Luke in the middle of YouTube and I don't want my son around YouTube alone. And she said she understood that but I don't believe anything she says now so."
207.0,Provider,she's facing as well.
11622.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
207.0,Provider,"So I know you said that you, because I think we got off with I said, well, it is best to let his mom know and speak to the mom and just saying hey listen, I will feel more comfortable with it so did his mom did you drop them over to the mom to the grandmother."
11622.0,Patient,"yeah I think I did drop. him off that day to the grandmother. yeah I think I did, and then um it was also going to be his weekend that was Labor day weekend I think. And then. You know, after she made those charges, I was talking to everybody and they're like I went to the Court, I filed a motion. For a hearing an emergency hearing which it got tonight anyways but um I didn't let him have him after that, because he's physically abusive and the COPs told me not to do it either, so I listened to the."
207.0,Provider,mm hmm.
11622.0,Patient,"um. I got a lawyer and it's like they're a grant so it's three for me, for now, which i'm really happy about. So, because I got a court hearing on the wealth of October so we'll see where it goes."
207.0,Provider,hold on one second hold on.
11622.0,Patient,You gotta saw. Know don't saw the last week. hey what's that noise honey go turn that off sweetie. Please. know.
207.0,Provider,The the cameras. you'll be surprised go behind the door and you'll see those are the artwork already started behind the door. With my kids I would go behind the door and the artwork already started.
11622.0,Patient,Oh no. How old are your kids.
207.0,Provider,"Well they're 1412 and six listen when they were younger. I always started by someplace they knew they know when it's wrong because they go hiding doing. Clearly, you know that what you did was wrong. And then you when you when you catch them they look at you with the puppy dog eyes. No, yes, you did."
11622.0,Patient,know I. Think he's our nighttime right now okay not during the day careful.
207.0,Provider,So so so right now he is. with you and not listening back.
11622.0,Patient,Sorry repeat that.
207.0,Provider,"No, I said right now he's 100% with you. yeah not good Okay, and at least you feel a little bit more secure, knowing that he's not around a lot of madness drama."
11622.0,Patient,"it's so much it's so much better like this, like. I can I have control right now i'm my child to save hundred percent of the time you know."
207.0,Provider,"know and it's just it's unfortunate that sometimes you don't necessarily want to use something against the person, but with everything that's going on, keep everything to a text message. As much as you can only because it's documentation that if ever. They try to say Oh well, this is my time and they didn't do this hey This is all the texting back and forth. And you show it, and if you, you were you know, so the COPs got involved, this is it. So that it's, not that I deliberately or I was being malicious or intentional about him not seeing him, but this is the reason, these are the reason why I had my concern, and this is where I did not want to allow him to go and whatever was going on between. His his girlfriend and hence. And so you know you tried your best so it's like every time that I was speaking to you, I was I keep it. Because this will be your documentation to prove it's not just you saying something, because in the eyes of the law you're trying to make it up, but if you say this is my proof. yeah and then you can show it to them now, it comes out of your court and now in now it's up to the judge to determine, because the unfairness about. Certain things when it comes down to children is, if you had knowledge of it and you still put him in that very toxic environment and something happened to him. He comes back on you, because then they're going to say you knew him to go there."
11622.0,Patient,"Yes, and that would be neglect."
207.0,Provider,"I might be me well, yes you're."
11622.0,Patient,Right.
207.0,Provider,And yeah.
11622.0,Patient,"Think about their side is is she is his girlfriend. knew about this, this whole time this past year that he was doing this to her and she knew about it, and told me she knew about it, and didn't tell me like NASA. For him on their part."
207.0,Provider,Because you didn't give him a blanket.
11622.0,Patient,what's that.
207.0,Provider,"I said, are you getting slapped because you're not giving him his blanket."
11622.0,Patient,i'm getting slapped because i'm not paying attention. come here. I want to show you my therapist premier. Sorry.
207.0,Provider,"Yes, it's just it's really a catch 22 you always and sometimes it's hard when you have to tell a person, it seems unfair to you like, why do I still have to put this at the end of the day, you're doing everything to protect yourself that in the end, if anything goes awry. You have your case this is everything that I did. I did everything through the letter of the law, the best way I knew how because I did I don't want this to turn back on me, because when it's all said and done, you're not trying to keep them away from bad, but it takes time you don't want to move your time."
11622.0,Patient,Right exactly.
207.0,Provider,"And that's that's just kind of how an even if you have to get grandma involved in some way and grandma says hey I don't want to do this Okay, well then, you know what now if I take. The measure of where I want full custody and he only gets him X amount of time then nobody could get mad at me because I did try to keep everybody in the loop before I took these extreme measures you're absolutely right and it's a girlfriend keeps the text message thing. letter. But it's being mindful when you respond, how you respond."
11622.0,Patient,Right right.
207.0,Provider,"Jennifer is always how you respond and, depending on what they text you depending on the content of that text don't respond."
11622.0,Patient,"Right right, and you know she's been trying to come at me and and trying to like get me to say that something weird about G that i'm sorry i'm going to use like just like one letters for his name. And she's been like the last time she texted me she was you know texting me saying that i'm telling G that it wasn't her fault and and all of a sudden it's put on me it's all my fault, one that you know it's all my fault now. So blame it all on me and i'm like, no matter what, nothing is going to change, no matter what I say to him, like she was trying to have me text him to tell him that it was all my fault and that wasn't her fault. He got me involved and their stuff you know, which was the right. Okay that's not. Okay we're done. Okay, I gotta talk okay. Do you want to eat or drink. You say hi."
207.0,Provider,hi how are you.
11622.0,Patient,Pretty. i'm pretty.
207.0,Provider,"Free how old, are you three."
11622.0,Patient,"Yes, we do."
207.0,Provider,I love it. Very. Big Three or so he gets the start What is it all. preschool next year right.
11622.0,Patient,yeah yeah. that's been hard.
207.0,Provider,"You put be put on the work on him, instead of pull up."
11622.0,Patient,"You um I do you sold right now but I tried, the whole commando thing you know. letting him. do it that way, but he's like. To go to the toilet you know."
207.0,Provider,"Normal. that's normal whether you do it commando or whether you do it with underwear the whole point of it is that if he feels it he's not gonna like it so then therefore he's going to go to the bathroom. Right that's the whole point of it, I mean I personally don't care for the commando thing because that means I have to do a whole lot of cleaning up. The only reason I don't care for the commandos make cuz that or if you give you just do the underwear straight it's that again that's a whole lot of underwear you gotta buy it on the words and cheap. You gotta watch a whole lot. So it's like."
11622.0,Patient,hmm either way it's hard right.
207.0,Provider,yeah either way apart. And when doing is it takes a little longer.
11622.0,Patient,"If you have a voice your voice. To to. So, how did you do."
207.0,Provider,"it's a little harder it's a little. harder um. I think, was the last one, how did I do it."
11622.0,Patient,So sorry Lucas.
207.0,Provider,"They just got used to it, they didn't care well educated different because mines and care. funny on my son okay. Mike instead it. Right so we're other people will say they didn't like it and they went so my kids is just like I don't care my son he's like I don't care. I run around be what all day I don't care so that's how he did it what for me, he was going to daycare so they help with the whole process, so what they did in the daycare is that they put them on a time so every so often they brought them to the bathroom."
11622.0,Patient,Oh. Like.
207.0,Provider,"Every like so after so let's say you he just ate something so like in an hour or an hour and a half, you brought him to the bathroom and you put them on the toilet."
11622.0,Patient,"Sorry, I want to meet you every time he yells because I don't want you to have to hear me yelling."
207.0,Provider,yeah but it's a time thing if you would have to be committed for time and the old one of the things that I did do. I don't know if you guys have one that's fine that's fine obviously it's fine. If you have one of the things that I did they had this watch like this potty training watch that that you can buy. And I would put it on his hand there was put it on their hand and every time it goes off it meant that you need to go use the bathroom.
11622.0,Patient,But like.
207.0,Provider,If you go into like do you have walmart there where you are.
11622.0,Patient,yeah yep.
207.0,Provider,"If you go to where you buy the pull ups, is where I had found the watch."
11622.0,Patient,Oh okay if.
207.0,Provider,"You buy the pull up to do the you're doing the potty training and that's where I found the watch and it's a watch that you put on their hand it tells time and everything, but it was sent in every so often, it will go off the alarm will go off, which means you got to go to the bathroom."
11622.0,Patient,Oh OK so like what like every 20 minutes 25.
207.0,Provider,"half hour and I forgot how I don't know if it was every hour or every two hours, I think it's, however, because also. When they're that you're depending on how much they do, and so, if he drinks a lot, then you will probably have to do it, maybe every 30 to 45 minutes, but if he doesn't drink a lot. In, you will get a custom to the time, so he eats breakfast and so maybe an hour hour and a half, you sit them on deployment and usually, when you sit them there, they will use it, and then you know okay he's about to eat or drink and so you would have to control how much he journey. So, because the whole idea is getting us to go into the bathroom but I tell you this voice for the whole lot longer. They really do, and if you're going to do the potty training during the day. You can't overwhelm yourself with the night one because the night one will require you having to get up every so often to take them and put them on the toilet, but you have to put them on the toilet you have to fully wake him up to put them on the toilet and do it, while he's. Actually kind of he'll never understand the concept of it but that's literally if you go to walmart look to see if they if they still have that watch that there's a watch, but I bought and I did put it on your hands. And it will go off, but if it's all about time and you have to time it and that's the whole job by itself that's why I want to that's a whole job is so. funny the potty training part of it it's a little bit and because he's not he doesn't go to daycare and all right he's always home with you. yeah that's what makes it a little bit harder. For you, because at school, other kids are doing it, so they get into it with the other kids."
11622.0,Patient,"Time to talk right now, can you just wait, please. Come to hear. you're done around China. Okay, where you can choose what show you on a lunch Okay, let me talk to my therapist okay. Do I work from home, no. i'm not. Are we getting back to work soon here well actually I was working I was doing the whole ship thing you know that whole like shopping for people. But then, you know I I literally became like 100% with Luke so I had to stop I have nobody to watch, for me, when I do it. A new level."
207.0,Provider,"So if you do go back to work, you would have to put them in daycare."
11622.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
207.0,Provider,"Are you do, you are you opposed to putting him in daycare."
11622.0,Patient,"Oh, not at all, he needs it, it would be good for him to do that."
207.0,Provider,Because he's an only child right now right.
11622.0,Patient,"Yes, yes."
207.0,Provider,"that's why he demand your attention so much because he has no other stimulation, but you. Right harder so and even if you started off with like a few hours, just to kind of for him to adjust. and eventually it even when he first starts it's going to be a hard adjustment, because he doesn't necessarily probably know how to play with kids or you know say he that he has to share so. It will be good for him, because a lot of what the potty training thing they they do teach them in school, they do go to I mean unless you go to one of those schools, who wants them to already be potty trained before they come. that's a different thing, but they they help with because that helps me a lot, especially my last child is being in the daycare. It helped my first child I was always home with her, and so it was a little easier. It was a little easier so, so it is, but again just prepare your mind with the boys, it is a little bit it's a little bit more of a challenge. hmm."
11622.0,Patient,But girls that was easier.
207.0,Provider,"With girl is my experience and what other people other people who have children, told me, it was easier with girls boys are a little bit more boy they're just different altogether. Different altogether, but I let me ask you this, how are you from a mental emotional standpoint, how are you able to maintain the balance, especially with with everything that's going on with his dad and and and. And with with him being home."
11622.0,Patient,"I don't know how I do it, I just do it, I just I don't even think about it, I just do it. I don't really know."
207.0,Provider,"But do you find at times, where you're getting overwhelmed and you're about to just kind of have a breakdown because it's a lot to just kind of deal with it without a break."
11622.0,Patient,"yeah, it is a lot um i'm lucky that I live with my parents, but I really do try to take everything on myself because that's just how I am I don't want to like rely on anybody for help. But sometimes like my mom will let me go to the store by myself, or you know, let me get a house for a minute sheila me out yesterday. And that was nice, but like if i'm feeling like worked up or whatever, I just have to tell look I need a minute i'll be right back you know, and if he follows me well, he follows me, but you know deep breath usually help her boss I don't know."
207.0,Provider,"You know what does he said that he go you live with your parents mom and dad. I don't know how you feel about this, but sometimes we're healthy when, for even with the potty training thing does when your dad using the bathroom. You have a goal with him. Yes. Oh yes, okay. Yes, and so that will help a lot so maybe having a party in the bathroom. When your body uses it just like Okay, you too."
11622.0,Patient,"yeah Look, we were in there yesterday and just got the bathtub which I was like this is perfect, you know. We got like a little frog thing that you like hang on the wall and the boys can just stand over it, you know it's something. And we tried using that and then he was sitting down and i'm like hey dad can you come in here with him, he wants you and he kind of sat with him, he didn't go but it's the point that he's trying he's sitting on the toilet."
207.0,Provider,"yeah yeah yeah it's not always going to be successful, now. me personally, I would the party party, because that means another, especially if you have a bowel movement, I mean I gotta clean that out or i'm not doing that I hated during so I got the one that sat on the seat back back over the toilet."
11622.0,Patient,Right yeah yeah.
207.0,Provider,"yeah I did the seat that sat on the toilet so we go into 20 different because. He was so another thing. With the potty train instead of getting the potty potty because there's a party party where, if they do something is things and all of us that are clean that up so get the seats that set the toilet. yeah and that that makes it makes them feel like a big boy that he's actually going on the toilet itself."
11622.0,Patient,"Right, did you have like a little like. step up to the toilet or did you oh."
207.0,Provider,"Yes, the stool that sat in front of the toilet and the seat that sits on the toilet has the handle so he sits on it, because of course he's too small. You did they could they fall in their life when they try to sit on the toilet be fine so because they don't know how to to hold themselves so they don't fall in. The seat that sat on the toilet and so when they step up on the stool and they sat on the potency feel like a big kid."
11622.0,Patient,"gotcha yeah yeah I like the people you're holding on to the seat, I like that. yeah i've got one. But it doesn't hold on to the seat, you know there's like a whole thing where it's got like the steps like."
207.0,Provider,"i'm in walmart it was just like anything like he should be seeing like maybe five bucks at the time but. You didn't on the side of the whole chasing of the toilet it had a handle on it, so they can hold on putting much he just sat it on the toilet. And so it's pretty much the size of the seat somewhat covers the whole opening of the the regular toilet so when they hit on me if they're not falling."
11622.0,Patient,Right now that's a good idea i'll probably have to get one of those I have one but it's just you know just playing.
207.0,Provider,"yeah just be just a second but up the different ones, and then they have the whites whites that may sell everything that's in that potty training section."
11622.0,Patient,UK yeah. And Amazon. So so many things and saying.
207.0,Provider,"Yes, yes, but it's just kind of evaluating if you have the support of your parents and all of that is the end of the day. From a from a psychological and emotional standpoint, it is looking at how can you manage your stress, because even though maybe right now you're just kind of. you're in reaction mode you're just doing what you have to do it at any point in time, you don't know when you can just have a breakdown, because sometimes breakdowns just come suddenly when you're going through. All the right things, and people are going to treat you as if you're holding it all together, simply because they don't see you visually. Breaking down and because you're just just doing what you need to do so, it is it's good food like you're living with your parents it's been to an inventory of your day to day activities, what is it what are your responsibly what is that you're trying to do and how are you. effectively managing all of your stressors you know and even with the girlfriend. designate a day in a time when you deal with her, if you have to deal with her don't allow her to be in your in your face every day or or let her feel like she has access to you every single day, but you want her to have a kid together. Right, why are we Why are we having all these constant communication we don't have kids together. So when it is you decide when you're going to choose to deal with her, the only person that you have any type of connection to. His wishes, and so, therefore, he is the one that you need to stay in constant communication, so if it is that he is not doing the communicating, then you take that into consideration. it's not oh i'm constantly dealing with the girlfriend because, like you said she could turn things on you at any time, simply because you keep that line of communication open with her."
11622.0,Patient,"Right right. Yes, I agree with you and. You know, Friday was the last time I talked to him and I offered to. Forget to visit his trial and and he turned it down he turned it down he didn't want to see, because I was going to be there. So."
207.0,Provider,"Then, are we don't know if I have that documentation I have that proof. until the next time you're supposed to do your visit again but entertaining the communication between you and her. You don't know at what so they're in their relationship that's not your business what's going on within their relationship. you're right there and so. Allowing her to feel as if at any point in time she could actually she the call us she could communicate with you, whenever it's convenient skillful turn that against you. Which is what your faith when she saying your for you, oh you're trying to make it all mindful, yes, everybody has to take responsibility to their their their their behaviors or their actions and all of that, but at the same time. This right now, whatever let's say there's a few going on between the three of you that has nothing to do with your child. you're responsible for Lucas what's the thing I don't know your last name is Lucas."
11622.0,Patient,what's his last name.
207.0,Provider,know. You were to suddenly Lucas to.
11622.0,Patient,"Just first name is Lucas his last name is like and. His dad had everything to do with the name, I think."
207.0,Provider,"So okay so everything is dealing with Lucas so okay when it comes down to the two of us. This is my time with him this is your time with him, so this is our communication. Anything else that's going on between the three of you, that is, between the three of you, but when it comes to this child, we have a responsibility to this child. And so it's always keeping everything in its category and keeping it in perspective, but at the same time, you have to know where you are in this season of your life. mentally emotionally and physically, you are living with your parents, whatever the whatever the agreement between you and your parents are regardless of what it is you're trying to figure out and sort out yourself. And in doing that you have to ensure that you're managing every aspect of that."
11622.0,Patient,Right and is it my responsibility to text him and say hey do you want to see your kid today or is that totally on him.
207.0,Provider,"Listen, because of you have the courts involved if he's supposed to be seeing his voice he supposed to see him today at three o'clock in the Texan and saying hey Where would you like me to drop them off what is it what are we doing. Let him respond to us because national documentation I keep them away from him, I asked him. And he did not tell me where to meet him and, at the end of the day, because of what's going on, you don't want to be in breach of something that was documented through the Court. Okay that's what that's all that's the only reason why i'm saying what i'm saying you don't want to be in breach of something, because that if he takes you to court, he gets his his act together and now all of a sudden, he wants to take you to court. Well, on this thing that they should never allow me to see him he's not adding well buddy you are, you are, you are, you are, you were ghosts for six months I you know where you were. Right now, you can say okay well here's my documentation for the last six months in the communications that we've had and how I wasn't getting any response that these are all the things that I did Now you can. You have your proof so that's the reason why i'm recommending if it is then text them and say hey today. Where do you Where would you like me to meet you to drop them off and let them respond and say hey sorry today I can't get him or whatever now it's not just my word against yours, this is my proof against your."
11622.0,Patient,"Okay, so he hasn't seen him, and you know, since Thursday so. Today, really isn't his day but should I just say hey you haven't seen him in a few days, do you want to see him today."
207.0,Provider,What is the what is the what is the what is. What is the agreement.
11622.0,Patient,"The agreement is Tuesdays. Three o'clock to Wednesday morning. Thursdays three to 630 or 30 or 645 i'm sorry and every other weekend, so this would be my weekend so today is not his day it's my day but i'm kind of just wondering like why he hasn't texted me to see him and and obviously you gave me that. You told me that I should be I should text him to just say for documentation purposes, but is it truly my responsibility to text him."
207.0,Provider,"No, I wouldn't say it's your responsibility, I wouldn't say that and, again, everything has to go back to if you had a lawyer. That was dealing with all of this, I would say you it's asking your lawyer it's reviewing and discussing all of it with your employer know where you stand and how should you deal with it. Honestly, that too. So it's while you were doing if it's a it's a custody thing, and you find that this is what's going on, and you find that this is just kind of a constant thing. Talk to the lawyers and say hey This is where i'm at because one or two days I mean I don't know that it's going to do anything but I would say talk to the lawyer. And then say hey but then I also have his girlfriend sending these messages about his whereabouts and all of that, like what do I do with that information because i'm not doing anything to I don't want to put my my son in what it seems to be. A negative or a toxic situation. Right or in danger, so I would what I would recommend is you talk to the lawyer, if you have a lawyer that you've been working with throughout all of this, I would. I would say, if the week. goes out and he still has a scene you notice that this is an ongoing thing I would reach out to the lawyer who was handling the whole case and ask them hey what what what should I do."
11622.0,Patient,"Okay Okay, because this lawyer specializes in domestic violence against women and children. So. um. I think he would definitely have you know something to say and i'm supposed to be talking to him today, sometimes, so I just got this lawyer, like the other day so. yeah i'll talk to him today about it and ask him what he thinks."
207.0,Provider,mm hmm because they because you're in you're in what Ohio.
11622.0,Patient,Michigan. Michigan.
207.0,Provider,"You know, every law, I mean every state has different laws and how they do things, and you know I can speak to you because i'm in Florida, so you know what when it comes down to the law and how they do certain things that may be a little bit different. But I would definitely say talk to the lawyer and put it all there to him and they'll let you know. hold on one second."
11622.0,Patient,me where do you want to know. He wants to toast yeah okay. My style. Please. Wait a minute. No.
207.0,Provider,I do have a little bit of family crisis.
11622.0,Patient,Or you got a family crisis to I don't even want to like are going on yo. I don't have you fill on your left drama.
207.0,Provider,know. I have a nephew that's visiting from Jamaica and oh my gosh so if he fine now he's fine.
11622.0,Patient,he's fine.
207.0,Provider,He don't be fun.
11622.0,Patient,"Oh, my God, so I just got a message from speaking of the devil."
207.0,Provider,message you. He wants to see him.
11622.0,Patient,"yeah he said I just left the courthouse I have no contact order with the girlfriend. Now, and our free trial is set for November 8 i'm moving back in with my parents today and I will be D you rg and alcohol testing as well. I no longer have warrants and i'm no longer a flight risk would love to see our son on our normal schedule again, you can send that to her, if you want, but I will be reaching out to her trying to put me in the middle again."
207.0,Provider,"exactly that know that that's between you and me. And so, with that information you hold him to that So then, therefore. need okay so from your perspective, knowing the situation that you're dealing with with him and his parents do you think that you feel much more comfortable, knowing that this is where he will be going to not just him, but also to his parents house."
11622.0,Patient,"i'm. not really. His mom isn't a nice person either she's like the culprit she's the main also the main manipulator in this. She stole my dog, for me, she hit me with a car door. she's threaten me I don't trust her either i'm his dad maybe a little bit, but his mom know so it's a toxic situation wherever. He goes with Lucas."
207.0,Provider,"Now, is it that Okay, knowing, because this is the other thing, even though you said it's a toxic situation, do you think that the mom has her feelings about you."
11622.0,Patient,i'm probably i'm trying to protect my child and she's trying to protect her kid I you know so.
207.0,Provider,"This is, this is the reason why i'm asking because though you feel the way you feel about mom and mom could have her feelings against you. Right and and familiar with from dislike against Cuba and which is your brand. On lady So do you think that. She would bring any harm or anything again her son's child, because this is not just your child, this is person's child So do you think that the way she treats you as the total outsider it's the same way, she would treat her son's child."
11622.0,Patient,"it's not really about that it's more about Greg i'm. Fighting with his parents in front of Lucas he abuses parents, just as well buddy else and his parents will sit there and take it and live for him it's a big deal I seen it happen before."
207.0,Provider,he's in their relationship is pocket within it so.
11622.0,Patient,Yes. I don't ever hurt my child i'm not saying that. i'm saying. She wouldn't do anything if he were to hurt his child in front of his parents.
207.0,Provider,"got to. Sochi enables a lot of the behaviors of him, but then he displaces her anger and for frustrating frustration on everybody yeah."
11622.0,Patient,So no. matter where Greg goes he's going to be toxic in front of Lucas so.
207.0,Provider,concerned about so you're really more concerned about him and his mental state of being.
11622.0,Patient,"Yes, because he's not fully there he's not mentally stable ever. So. he's gotten ways plus he's like I said he's mentally unstable all the time."
207.0,Provider,"Okay, so, in whatever he just said i'm going to get drug tested and all of that weekly, but is it that he he is opposed to going into whether it be a rehab or getting counseling."
11622.0,Patient,yeah he tried it with he and she said it didn't work out so.
207.0,Provider,he's in the weight of the world on his shoulder he thinks.
11622.0,Patient,He thinks he's godly. I mean he's my parents of being drug dealers i'm like. Stop like he's trying to to start stuff trying to get to get a reaction out of me trying to hurt me and my family and it's just unacceptable.
207.0,Provider,he's unstable.
11622.0,Patient,"Right and he needs he needs mental health before he can be alone with our child, you know."
207.0,Provider,"And I think that is where the lawyer, that you speak to you address your concerns, but in addressing your concerns and not sound like the angry baby mom if you have to have your proof. right we just wanted it what it is, you have to. You have to have your proof, and you have to have you have to have concrete evidence of your concern and why you feel like for the mental health standpoint, he is not he's unstable, not just for yourself but for everybody else around, and this is not just about his son. So just about him. The risky in denial about the help that you need, and so this is kind of where a lot of those text messages that she says, and all of that. To seek to say hey, these are the these are, this is a little evidence that I have that supposed to show that you have concerns, and this is where you present it to them, where it is like you said they can file an emotion. emotion to reopen the case or to re evaluate and for him to go get a psychological evaluation."
11622.0,Patient,And that's why he needs.
207.0,Provider,"But that's where this is where you would have to share all of this with the the lawyer, that you call and just saying hey these are my concerns and you it's being in a place of having your emotions in balance in check where they're not hearing. More of your emotions in comparison to your legitimate concern. And so, when you talk to them to let them know this is the reason why yes he's saying that he's going back in with this parent but he's also abusive. mentally and emotionally to his parents and I am concerned that if he if I let him go over to his grandparents to see them this is how I I i'm fearful. That he will behave a certain way in front of them, so you would have to put all about their lawyer and let them say you have a case where you don't."
11622.0,Patient,"Oh yeah I mean that's what I texted this lawyer is like every almost every almost every detail, but what I could. And the statement to. Because he approved it with just my little email that I sent him about you know Greg. And how i'm fearful for myself and my child so. He approved that, and you know so i'll be telling him every little detail that i've got you know. yeah."
207.0,Provider,"yeah i'll definitely bear the one SEC, to tell you exactly what ground, you have to know you don't have to like keep texting him back and forth, and all of them and waiting for him to text you but. Because I don't know how that is really going to help anything I think it's really having the lawyer guide you and tell you where you know where you stand and what you should do and what you should not do, because you also want to provoke situation."
11622.0,Patient,"Right and i'm not. don't provoke I don't I try to stay drama free you know just try to do the right thing, unless my child is in danger, and he is with correct so i'm protecting him and Greg doesn't understand that he thinks this is all games and. he's just he's he's not growing up, he doesn't have that maturity level to think like that, like an adult mm hmm."
207.0,Provider,"So and and I think it's in your benefit to like it is like he tries to come back at you, as you go through all of this and. You know, they would want to look at you under a microscope if it comes to it it's This is where you say, well, I am in a program I am getting my counseling I am getting my end. i'm seeing my doctor I am doing what I need to do, they can always say Okay, well then let's see proof of it and you say, well, here it is. yeah and you know you just go, this is just kind of because sometimes people will start with pitch for pat."
11622.0,Patient,"Oh, I totally agree, I totally know that they would look at me too and i'm fine with it, I got nothing to hide, why don't look at me right here like got proof to show you that i'm doing what I have to do to be a good mom so."
207.0,Provider,let's see let's go to you for.
