2964.0,Patient,"Last night he only woke up a few times, he did pretty good last night. Okay, but as soon as he fell asleep as a breastfeeding, and meanwhile he starts doing this and i'm like oh no. And then he did find though during the night that. You know I must have slept good, because I was tired. sure you look up a few times so he woke up like seven o'clock this morning he's ready to go. it's only 11 but now he's like already ready for a nap. yeah ready by 12."
527.0,Provider,Sure yeah yeah well how are you doing with all of this.
2964.0,Patient,"I was really emotional for a couple weeks, but. yeah I just I don't think it's epilepsy I don't really know epilepsy is, but my mom had seizures. Grand mal seizures you know really bad. I don't know if epilepsy is like kind of same kind of seizures but it doesn't seem like he's having a seizure, you know when he wakes up in the middle of the night he can look at me. and tell me he's hungry or whatever he does you know. Like out of it. And it's not just like. A seizure that happens, and then it goes away. All night long off and on."
527.0,Provider,So.
2964.0,Patient,"I don't think it's epilepsy, but who knows I don't know."
527.0,Provider,"yeah yeah. Well i'm glad that you guys are getting a man and getting checked out and see what's going on, or if it's you know some nerves or something that you know, is the growing and and you know some nerves are developing or changing because of that I don't know yeah. yeah."
2964.0,Patient,"yeah very because if it's not that it's the other, the hypnotic mio closeness or whatever they said. Then they they just grow out of it so it's like oh my gosh and they've seen it. have been tough for. They only grow out of it by one and he's already passed one so i'm like. I guess that would be the best thing because you just grow out of it."
527.0,Provider,Sure yeah.
2964.0,Patient,But dang four years is a long time.
527.0,Provider,yeah yeah definitely.
2964.0,Patient,"Definitely, I feel like i'm on edge a lot. You know, really. grouchy during the day. I feel bad because I. I kind of pick on jake. I don't mean to but i'm just so exhausted and then brooklyn you know she doesn't listen does not listen, no matter what you do you spank her timeout take your stuff away she does not listen."
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
2964.0,Patient,So it's like it's frustrating and I deal with them all day by myself and then. Sure by five o'clock i'm like oh my gosh i'm done. i'm done with her. And then. Like lately she says. After she gets it a SWAT on the butt to be like where do you speak me you don't love me and i'm like brooklyn we do to love you we just want you to be good. be good girl. And she's like i'm bad I know we should obviously she hears that. She must hear it cuz she says that. She used to be such a good little girl she I don't I think it's the baby she's jealous or something.
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
2964.0,Patient,"she's awful to him. Okay it's sad she's always pushing on them and grabbing him by his neck right here, because she's bigger and she can stop them. she's just mean. I don't know if she knows what jealous means but. I think she is."
527.0,Provider,Sure yeah.
2964.0,Patient,"But I tell her i'm like we love you just as much as any other ones, the kids we love you guys all."
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
2964.0,Patient,"And then, when we pray at night I pray for you know. She stops and you can tell, we pray together every night. Lately i've been praying that josh gets better you know, and then, and then I say, please God help brooklyn stay calm and be a good girl. So she can understand you know. How she's listening."
527.0,Provider,"yeah yeah yeah So how are you because I know we talked about doing some kind of behavioral adjustments, you know and kind of reward system for her. Just to kind of help help you guys. You know, manage manage her better and and give her some some incentives or you know reasons to you know change her behaviors to like recognize."
2964.0,Patient,"know what I was talking to her about it that day last month, and we were going to get a chart and make a chart and put stars on it and jake was like maybe that might help that might help and then that's when that happened with josh so I totally forgot about it until you just said something. I forgot about it, I can't believe it that's it."
527.0,Provider,"yeah yeah that's okay. yeah well obviously things came up, and you know that got you distracted and. Concerns so yeah definitely makes sense."
2964.0,Patient,"Oh, I can't believe that just. blew my mind that's crazy."
527.0,Provider,"yeah yeah and I, you know i'm wondering if part of it, too, is just. You know, it was what was kind of the period of time, where she was been like the only child was there."
2964.0,Patient,till she was over two.
527.0,Provider,yeah yeah so you know she she learned what it was like to have all that attention and now now to shit have to share it like how like who's who's coming in invading my space now so. yeah mm hmm.
2964.0,Patient,"And they always fight for my attention lately, since he can walk you know and stuff."
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
2964.0,Patient,"He knows that he wants me and so she'll run up to me and grabbed me and mommy I want you. to write to me scream and grabbed me and i'm like oh my gosh. Yes to just be her I breast better tell right before I have this baby. mm hmm so we were like really close you know she slept with me all night. And then, as soon as he comes I can't hold her anymore like I did all the time."
527.0,Provider,"Sure yeah so for you it's adjusting adjusting those boundaries with with them, you know and setting those because you are home all day with them, so you know they know that they can have access to you all the time. So yeah if for you it's going to be having to. set some limits and boundaries and spaces, you know, like. To help them know that it's okay like they don't have to hang on you all day long."
2964.0,Patient,Like yeah.
527.0,Provider,"yeah like because i'm wondering if there's you know, then that could potentially cause like some anxieties or separation anxieties like if mom's not around and then. But also helping you feel more confident that they can have their own spaces to like you and you being okay with getting some breaks throughout the day of. You know let's let's play time in your rooms, you know for for 30 minutes you know we're 15 minutes, so you can just go do the dishes if you want or go to the bathroom or you know, whatever it may be."
2964.0,Patient,Take a shower.
527.0,Provider,"Take a shower yeah exactly so you know that may be some things to kind of think about like, how can we, you know, obviously, you know josh still needs some supervision, too, but you know. Is there is there moments, where you can have them kind of playing in their own spaces like and trying to you know build their confidence and in learn how to take care of themselves by themselves without you having to do that for them."
2964.0,Patient,yeah.
527.0,Provider,yeah.
2964.0,Patient,"They can play by themselves, both of them. But I can't leave brooklyn like they're playing in here with their toys. I can't leave brooklyn and josh together, I can. walk away from them, not for one minute, because you heard him."
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
2964.0,Patient,"Those, like, I never can walk away it's like come on brooklyn just just leave me alone."
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
2964.0,Patient,"she's like he Trolls on my stuff he REX everything which I understand you know because he's playing barbies and go come and just. yeah he wants to play, but he's just the baby."
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
2964.0,Patient,But i'm like all you have to do is yell for me call for me and i'll help you.
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
2964.0,Patient,But she gets mad to show him or throw things out of them are knocking down.
527.0,Provider,"yeah so maybe for her if it's if she's wanting to do those things, maybe it's. You know, is there times that there's activities that they can play together, you know and then and toys that are that they can both play, together with. And then, if there's times that she wants to just play with her barbies then maybe you know she goes to a room and plays for a little bit and and has that separation from him and and that kind of her me time to do her toys. And then, and then he can have again kind of those separate spaces like he can learn to play with things by himself and then you know what our activities that you know that they can do together that you know are less you know less less yeah a less lesser evil to cause. cause a fight."
2964.0,Patient,"yeah. Doing that lately she'll come in here to play barbies and shut the gate and she's like I don't want them coming in here because i'm like okay. wow sometimes just shut the door, but i'm like no."
527.0,Provider,She gets up on my dresser and gets into my make.
2964.0,Patient,she's learned to shut the gate now so.
527.0,Provider,"mm hmm. yeah, and so I think helping kind of support that for her so that she can she can have that time just to kind of be with herself and maybe learn to regulate her herself a little bit better to. yeah yeah."
2964.0,Patient,"yeah cuz, what do you. deal with their emotions like. She gets frustrated and just screams and she won't ask for help, or."
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
2964.0,Patient,They might have time you try to you know you're like come on just let me help you and she just is freaks just so freaked out.
527.0,Provider,yeah just wanting to try trying to maintain or learn that independence for herself mm hmm but still needs help.
2964.0,Patient,"yeah it's like here just let me show you. figure it out, you know your show where she's like oh. jack it up or taking it off. My God. And now you've learned that behavior so every time he wants something he just screams or can't do something he screams i'm like. No, not another one. yeah yeah."
527.0,Provider,"yeah. i'm wondering Christina that's why I wonder like if maybe that behavior chart might come in handy. Because, then, if she starts doing things you know, maybe, maybe he gets stickers to like they both can do similar things, but I also i'm wondering if. You know just working with them on coping skills, I wonder if, like doing some education like drawing some feeling faces with them. Christina like like an anger, you know, an anger face, and you know and then talking about like. You know, when we get mad like what's mad and see if they can see if brooklyn can can talk about like what what mad or angry or looks like or up you know, whatever that that face looks like. And then you know, helping our like what can we do when we feel this feeling, you know, one of the things I was just looking at my refrigerator because i've got like this magnet. I got from one of my conferences and it's got a lot of feeling faces on it and then it's got like a little square magnet and you put like what are you feeling today on one of the faces, but I wonder. i'm i'll see what I can find that that might be something and I can email it to you Christina something Maybe you can print off and like you know hang up and and help them, you know or help brooklyn first of all like identify different feelings like sad or mad or happy, you know things."
2964.0,Patient,"You know, help her to go."
527.0,Provider,"yeah because in part of that is helping you to also recognize what can I do to manage my anxieties when they're feeling this or when i'm feeling upset like what, what can I do you know, and maybe help them, you know. To do those things like Okay, you know we're mad So what do we do in our man, we all sit in our little squares and we just sit and be quiet for a little bit until we come down. You know, coming up with maybe some things that are pretty basic. That they can do."
2964.0,Patient,"yeah they have another to school, they have this little box, because they don't have time outs, I asked him. Just starting out the school yet because she's missing one shot and jake won't allow her to get it. He doesn't believe in shots. So i've been sneaking them, you know here and there, so now she's got one left. The homeschool part of it, they come here, but it's not the same All they do is they just do something for an hour and that's it, you know next week, like tomorrow it's not the same as going to school, so at the school, she said, they have a box."
527.0,Provider,Okay.
2964.0,Patient,"You know, a mat in it, and when they feel upset they do it themselves. When they feel upset or angry or. They go to the box themselves and give themselves a timeout and it."
527.0,Provider,uh huh.
2964.0,Patient,"yeah that's a good idea, make it something like that."
527.0,Provider,"mm hmm yeah definitely yeah and and also just helping you know when. You know, when she does go to those spaces like making sure she has that space to herself, you know and not have you know you not being in there or her brother being in there as a distraction, but really letting her kind of set and figure out how to calm herself down. In that moment yeah and maybe just kind of peeking in and checking on her you know around the corners and see if she's. Okay, but. You know not totally just leaving or unsupervised but you know you can always check in and go, you know how are you feeling, are you feeling better, and so do you need some more time and your box or on your chair or matt or whatever you want to make it. You know and kind of help her to recognize, you know, am I, you know where she's at with her feelings too so. yeah that's a good that's a good idea I like that."
2964.0,Patient,That is a good idea I just wonder if she would go in it like we have this timeout chair.
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
2964.0,Patient,"And I have to buckler in it, because she won't stay in it. And, even with the buckle she slips out soon times. Like that badge where. She will not even stay on a timeout. she's like no i'm not doing it. It sounds like What do you do I don't know what to do."
527.0,Provider,"mm hmm. And that may that may need to be like on her behaviors chart you know she gets a sticker if she stays if she takes a timeout and she Maybe she gets to stickers if she goes and takes a timeout by herself on her own. That this you know, this is a place where you can go and calm down this is, this is a safe place for you to calm down. yeah."
2964.0,Patient,"Maybe we should like that better something like that, because they're talking about chair is out in the living room where everybody's around you know I just turn it around to the wall, because I feel bad when I put her in the bedroom by herself I don't know why shouldn't. They just feel bad jake always threatened to look in the bathroom in the dark. Show."
527.0,Provider,yeah we don't want to see yeah we don't want to scare.
2964.0,Patient,yeah you can't say that you're just scaring or that's not right.
527.0,Provider,yeah.
2964.0,Patient,"yeah never does it, but he always says that he just tried to scare out of being bad and i'm like."
527.0,Provider,"Sure well and I think two is maybe also letting her know like it's okay to be mad, but what we're going to learn how to do mad. You know, in a better way like mad does not mean you hit people matt you know you can be mad in your little safe place like that's This is where you can be mad at. But we're not we're not mad we don't yell we don't hit people we don't throw things. You know, helping her understand these are the things that we do and we're mad we go sit in our Chair and we calm down and we stay quiet, so that she knows it's okay to have that feeling. But there's other ways to manage it, you know, just as, just as we all know, you know we can't go around throwing things and hitting people when we get mad so. You know there's constantly and there's consequences with that so. yeah so in you know and and so maybe trying to kind of you know, turn things around a little bit for her so that she recognized because I wonder how much of it is she just sees herself as bad, and so it doesn't it doesn't really matter what she does it's because everything's bad."
2964.0,Patient,"thing she is bad, but. Not a stop saying. it's just hard, this is my fourth you know, I have four kids. And she's the only one, I mean the other ones i've done bad things you know when. When my oldest. son, he was little he was wild too and. He got in trouble a few times, but nothing like this, I mean this is just she's totally out of control. I feel like i'm gonna lose my mind I don't know what to do, I don't know how to stop it. Sure, like i've tried everything I don't. We should just stop. Here, like that."
527.0,Provider,"yeah yeah. yeah and you know and part of it is probably just trying to figure out how to get attention and so she's learned that she gets more attention by acting out, then. yeah doing you know things that she's supposed to be doing."
2964.0,Patient,"I think that's a. big part of it. don't take that, last night I think she does this for attention. Even though it's not good, you know she's doing so we're. I don't know."
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
2964.0,Patient,Good attention.
527.0,Provider,"yeah I mean I mean it's just like us to Christina you know we do things that maybe aren't the best behaviors for us, but if it gets a. If it gets a reaction, or it makes us feel better in the moment then whether it's negative or positive we do it. And so you know, helping again helping her understand you know how to change those behaviors that that she can get more attention you know or as equal attention, or better attention. From you guys when it may, it may be that's what she's you know, maybe, maybe that's what's going on in our little head is you know I I need to be seen and heard so that they don't forget about me."
2964.0,Patient,"Oh yeah. You know, because, because there is so many people around she's one of the littlest ones mean it what it is."
527.0,Provider,yeah.
2964.0,Patient,It sucks I feel bad she she can be good she could be such a sweetheart.
527.0,Provider,mm hmm. And when she's doing well where's your anxiety level Christina.
2964.0,Patient,"I don't have anything. Okay it's just so nice, just when she's doing good like, but the way to keep her good is when you keep her busy 24 seven if you're doing something with her most the time you know. Do an activity or baking I mean you just got she has to have structure 24 seven i'm you have to do something with her all the time if she's not doing something with someone that she's doing something crazy jumping on the couches throwing balls in the House knocking stuff over."
527.0,Provider,yeah.
2964.0,Patient,"once in a while I noticed she'll play by yourself and play with their barbies but not a lot, but she can do it by yourself, sometimes and do really good i'll watch on the camera in here. And i'm like oh how cute she's been so good, you know she's talking with her dolls. Most the time she's like can you play with me. Can you play with this doll with me all the time, everybody all day long."
527.0,Provider,"yeah. She. Are you play with yeah I do really well in school, then just having some socialization learning socialization skills. To yeah. And boundaries, you know she's you know she's going to be able to learn some of those two, but I think also you know, supporting those at home for her as well, like you know this is mom's space, this is joshua space, this is brooklyn space, you know."
2964.0,Patient,"yeah I think she will do really good at school, I think that's what she needs and maybe that will help her. I think it's the 17th she has an appointment on the 17th. And i'm just going to do it, I know jake's can be so mad but it's. An immunization that she's already had she's already had three of the same one. And it does suck they shouldn't tell you what to do with your kids. And if I wasn't having such a hard time with her if we were all not having such a hard time with her, I would just do the homeschool thing with her, but she needs it. I mean it's like she's crying for help you know. However, she can, however, she knows how. She needs to go to school, she needs that. I feel bad doing that, but."
527.0,Provider,"Well, and you know what they might be able to also just have a better assessment of what's going on to you know is she having you know is she having some attention you know ADHD behavioral problem you know, problems with focus and concentration or hyperactivity. You know, and being able to help them, you know assess you know her intellectual part but behavioral part as well, and maybe even give you guys some direction on on that piece, for her to. You know, and how best how best to structure her day. You know."
2964.0,Patient,"that's what I wonder if it is because it I feel like she can't concentrate like I try to talk to her, you know brooklyn come down listen to me listen you got to calm down this is what you got to do, and she just can't she can't it's like she can't calm down. Sometimes, she she's really hyper and then, once in a while I noticed she can't even come down enough to do something so maybe it is. attention. I don't know something like that ADHD or a dd I don't know. Maybe she needs medication, but they're like she's not taking anything she's too little, which I understand I don't learn all zoned out. Now i've done would help her even just a little bit. Because it can't be fun getting in trouble all the time, you know."
527.0,Provider,"Well yeah exactly I mean that's you know she's she's trying to figure out how to regulate herself to and is just kind of all over the place, like yeah i'm sure it's it doesn't feel good to her. yeah and we definitely don't want to reinforce you know her feeling like she's a bad person all the time either."
2964.0,Patient,You know and.
527.0,Provider,You know and and thinking that that she doesn't do anything right because you know we definitely want to try to reinforce her feeling good about herself.
2964.0,Patient,"yeah that's what I worry about is because you forget about stuff like that, because."
527.0,Provider,"you're losing your mind guys yeah well, I think. yeah I mean definitely you're overwhelmed just you know because you're dealing with them all day long and just. Trying to meet their needs and then trying to meet your own needs and your needs aren't getting met as much, and so you're you're getting depleted and so you're not getting a chance to refuel yourself to be able to balance them a little bit better."
2964.0,Patient,yeah. I know when she does do stuff good I really tell her how good of a job.
527.0,Provider,She did yeah.
2964.0,Patient,"awesome it was I just need to remember, I need to do more, push just do a lot of good things yeah."
527.0,Provider,"And it may be helping her identify what are what are good behaviors and what are what are. Bad behaviors or net negative be you know, probably bad good and bad behaviors you know good behaviors are playing nice with my brother. You know not hitting not throwing things not jumping on the table, or you know, on the couch or you know things like that, like. Like you know, maybe, making a list and so she can pick out like you tell me what what why you got a start on the US and see if she can point out like. I you know played nicely with my brother, so I get a star and tell me why you were in in timeout and then she can point to something you know I hit my brother, you know help her and kind of make those connections with her behaviors."
2964.0,Patient,yeah.
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
2964.0,Patient,"have to remember to do that, this time. Now i've kind of calm down from joshua stuff."
527.0,Provider,"yeah. yeah you got a lot going on Christina definitely. yeah how are you and jake doing that's I know, last time we spoke to you are feeling pretty upset and irritated with them."
2964.0,Patient,"You know I didn't even talk to them you're like you need to go out and talk with them, I after we went out there, I was all. I need to have a talk with you about your smoking issue you know. And he stopped smoking all the time I didn't even talk to him, I said we got to talk tonight about you smoking pot. He did all by himself I didn't even talk to him, I noticed i'm like wow you're doing good he's not outside all the time, you know. uh huh for this whole month he's done really good but I noticed the last few days, unless it's just because i'm irritated more I don't know. Are you you're outside I noticed i've been saying a few more times lately just the last few days, I just gotta remind him. didn't even have a dog and he. He was like oh. He knew, you know either slow down or."
527.0,Provider,Okay okay. yeah.
2964.0,Patient,"I told them last night. i'm just tired of living here. And i'm going to leave i'm going to take the kids away and he's like what is that gonna help because brooklyn was going crazy, you know getting in trouble and. i'm just tired i'm I I don't know like you say depleted i'm so tired i'm dealing with josh i'm the only one that deals with them, you know. Besides me helps me all day long with the kids. She helps me all day long. I deal with them at night so it's hard for me to get good sleep so i'm really irritated and then I told him he's like what's that going to do what's that going to help like I just want to leave I don't want to be here anymore, I want my own place and. yeah and then I he said something. And I said i'm leaving you too, and I could show you is like. And I didn't mean I was divorced in him or anything i'm just like i'm leaving you're asking I do you. want to go. Then i'm going, and I hope i'm. Not about it because I could tell he was. You could tell it was a little upset and like sad he wasn't saying anything so last night I told him I was like I said I didn't mean i'm leaving you like divorcing you like i'm just leaving your ass behind you can stay here. yeah so they made him feel better but yeah it's just hard living with other people."
527.0,Provider,sure it is yeah.
2964.0,Patient,"I think that's a part of brooklyn's issue she's got so many people telling her what to do. You know there's how many people there's four people in this bedroom I six or seven people in this House. Okay yeah two different families his parents and then us and our family so she's got all these people around her everybody. tells you what to do, she goes to do something, you know she's got me saying yes or no, and then she's got painting saying yes or no, and then her dad you know so just. gotta different answers coming from everywhere and it confuses her."
527.0,Provider,"Sure, a lot of mixed messages that she's getting yeah. which we all yeah which would confuse any of us, you know, obviously we you know we need direction you know and she's she's trying to learn things to at her age, you know she's just a little sponge soaking in everything. yeah mm hmm."
2964.0,Patient,"So I know that's a big part of it. But I guess it's just hard for penny to stay out of it because she's been here the whole time you know she feels like she's her mom too so i'm like. everybody's got to stop she's got two parents, you know we got to be a team yeah it's hard for us to be team or frustrated and everybody else saying what to do, sure."
527.0,Provider,"And, and I think if you guys come up with you know a good plan for you know brooklyn and then and then reinforce that. That you that you and jake are gonna you need them to take a step back because we've got to get her. You know, listening to us and and not that she's not going to listen to her grandparents, but you know she has got to learn that you guys are. Are her parents and that she needs to listen to you and follow your directions, they can reinforce that or say. You know, you need to go talk to your mom you need to go talk to your debt, you know, keep kind of redirect them. Back to you guys, so that you can reinforce but, but I wonder if, like the behavioral you know just saying you know, this is what we're going to this is what we're going to implement and we're going to try this and see. If it makes a difference and so with that you know we need we need you guys to take a step back, so that we can we can try this for ourselves."
2964.0,Patient,You know.
527.0,Provider,"You know, because because you guys need you guys need that to build that confidence with yourself like and lets you know not that you're not important in their lives, but we need to make a presence our presence stronger in the in the kids eyes."
2964.0,Patient,yeah that they know. He has a hard time. Telling his mom what to do.
527.0,Provider,"And you don't want again you don't want to feel like the bad person always having to say. Stop this stop that you know, like you, don't want to feel like the bad person either. Like always be the police in the family."

It might not in some aspects of you know, keeping the House as clean as it is doing the dishes cooking which penny does most all that and I take care of the kids all the time.
