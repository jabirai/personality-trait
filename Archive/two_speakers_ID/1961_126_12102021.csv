Just received themselves and come back every year, you know the plant dies off. Right so so much three. started with these are some of the easier ones. They have some really beautiful ones that are just I mean. super Installers patterns and stuff. But they take a lot of. Specific. They weren't natural bread plants, you know hybridize.

1961.0,Patient,"Oh yes, it's just like cooking. And he made us right, it really is the only problem is that they take so long. to figure out the right business yet. to know if it turned out good or not, you know i've waited months for a beer, to get them. You know. fermenting and everything, where I had a really good. taste like shit."
126.0,Provider,"But it seemed like such a good idea at the time. yeah well you know i've been watching these programs about america's yeah how how each thing like ice cream came about how peanut butter came about how. You know, delivering milk to people came about and it's like all these people, especially the ice cream when they were thinking about inventing ice cream people didn't even have refrigerators. yeah so their whole thing of you know that's how the refrigerator trucks drive up and down the street that's how that got invented because people didn't have freezers in their house, so that the truck would go up and down the street and sell sell the ice cream right out of the truck. So it's it just is so interesting to how many times that guy I think it was the one for humor good humor bar, I think that was the first ice cream that was in. That was in the 1900s you know people in those days, either didn't have a refrigerator or they called it an icebox with a big block of ice inside."

126.0,Provider,uh huh.
1961.0,Patient,giant that you put ice blocks in and. Right food and we'd actually reconditioned it turned it into a if this rich guy that he used to race cars to we put as a trophies in the Center case and on the top we put all his medals pointing to the Center case turn this whole thing and turned it into a bar. But one of the mobile. ice can tell you it's pretty neat.
126.0,Provider,That sounds very creative. yeah it's cool when you come up with the these creative ideas and then get to see it to fruition you all the way through to the end.
1961.0,Patient,"yeah I really liked what for that guides that you know riches can be really down to earth. trusted us and pretty much just said, do whatever you think. I like either."
