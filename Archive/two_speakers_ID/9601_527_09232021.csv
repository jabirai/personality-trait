On me so. yeah all right well all right, at least I can hear you now, so I don't know what's going on. So that might it might have been the problem on my end earlier so oh shoot okay. Well, how are things going Kristen."
9601.0,Patient,Fine i've been pretty busy my sister just got married on Saturday so.
527.0,Provider,yeah how did that go.
9601.0,Patient,"It was good, it was fun. yeah yeah my boyfriend came and I got to see a lot of my cousins so that's fine."
527.0,Provider,"Okay, good. You got a cool little room you're in today."
9601.0,Patient,Thank you. A little plant. Show yeah.
527.0,Provider,Okay well we'll fill me in how how have you been.
9601.0,Patient,"i'm good. I. had trouble honestly finding the. Like what you wanted me to do over the last week, I think it was just like."
527.0,Provider,"Oh, your homework assignment."
9601.0,Patient,"I know you were asking me like what. My like treatment plan should be or what I need. um and I guess i'm not really sure I feel like i'm. don't have like any knowledge as to be able to figure that out. Not that's, the only thing that i've really been like thinking about a little bit."
527.0,Provider,What do you feel like you want to improve on Christian for yourself. um.
9601.0,Patient,"I feel like a big thing is like so. Like control, maybe because. I feel like i'm. With eating disorder and, like other things, a lot of the problem is like I either. want like too much of something or I just like have to cut it out completely I feel like that way with food sort of like either i'm just going to like eat whatever I wanted to I feel full arm will like not eat at all if I have to like overthink it. And then. yeah I feel like i'm just not that way with everything like even."
527.0,Provider,"Okay. Okay, just that all excuse me that all or nothing. yeah okay."
9601.0,Patient,It carries over to like every area of my life smile.
527.0,Provider,"Okay okay. yeah what Okay, so I was looking the assignment you'd asked me so we were going to oh so the things that we were going to focus on was. trying to figure out what the barriers are that get in the way for you working on your treatment goals. Like is there things that you're avoiding is there things that are obstacles to your treatment that kind of stop you from moving forward or keep you stuck and then the other one was we were going to work on. You we're going to work on some affirmation cards using your artwork and stuff. I was getting creative with them."
9601.0,Patient,"I wasn't able to do that i'm not sure what if our time to do it anyways but. still a good idea, so."
527.0,Provider,you'll have to designate some self care time to take care of. You yeah even if it's just 510 minutes to one or two.
9601.0,Patient,you like. I guess the only form of self care that I like oil set time aside for is like creating art that I want to art pieces from this also I might be able to tie that into their.
527.0,Provider,yeah.
9601.0,Patient,"yeah I think one like. Just a cool barrier. For my treatment close would be like not. Like my living situation right now, and I think if I was like living alone or like not living with family and my mind would be a little more clear and i'd be able to think about myself more. Whereas I feel like when i'm surrounded by certain people my I just think like really negatively, and I feel like there's no space for me to think about other things, a lot of time or focus. So."
527.0,Provider,"So how can I mean, obviously we can't change your living situation too much."
9601.0,Patient,time to be able to fix that.
527.0,Provider,"yeah but in but in the meantime. You know if that's not something that can change right away, you know what can we do to make space or make your. Your space recovery focused for you and and a healthy environment for you like, where do boundaries, need to be set, where it is you know self care, you know come in, where you know how can we maybe explore that."
9601.0,Patient,"I mean, I guess, just like learning to do things more. Like. Like internal work, I guess, like thinking about things like reframing my thoughts or. Like. I don't know, I guess, just like being able to rely on myself or things like that."
527.0,Provider,"yeah so have you done any word Christian as far as like just even identifying all the negative thoughts that go through your head. And, just like those negative and maybe even just negative beliefs about yourself and if they're rational beliefs or if they're irrational beliefs, have you done any."
9601.0,Patient,know.
527.0,Provider,"yeah and I know we I don't know, I think we talked the last time, as far as like doing some journaling and stuff like that, if that. yeah so maybe maybe it's just starting with at the top of the page just putting. My However, you want to name it I don't care how you how you want to do it Christian, but you know, do you want to put like my my belief system or my you know. My thoughts about my you know thoughts. thoughts and feelings, I have about myself, however yeah I don't care how you want to name it and then just make a list of all those things that you think about with yourself, you know. And you don't have to necessarily. You know dissect them apart, you know, initially, maybe it's just getting all those thoughts out on paper and just looking at them. And then we can kind of sort through those two."
9601.0,Patient,"yeah I think a lot of. Like I just. I think I mentioned before, like. Like dissociating or just like forget fullness. Where I think it's like intentional my brain is just like trying to. Forget things immediately. That don't serve me. positively so. I think like that is also something that I want to work on. But it's so like. subconscious at this point that it's really hard. To like yeah. I feel like I have to be like running to flash cards to like memorize."
527.0,Provider,Things.
9601.0,Patient,About myself I don't know if that one's fixable but.
527.0,Provider,yeah I think it's definitely looking I mean how long has that negative self talk tape been there for you Kristen.
9601.0,Patient,"um I mean probably forever. I feel like it's been like. Just like learn. As a kid. And I just like. tell myself. Like have repeated things to myself and I now believe are true, or like. They used to affect me. yeah so."
527.0,Provider,"we're so if we had to maybe think about where those thoughts and beliefs came from, or started from where you think I mean do you have any idea where those things that. People said to you friends were they things that you just you know made assumptions about yourself, or you know put pressure on yourself."
9601.0,Patient,"um well like physically speaking about myself image. I think like family members have a lot to do with it, because my grandma, especially when like always take a shopping, as we were young and like. has always like made comments about our way or like even strangers like commenting on how they love or outpatient were that were just like. Oh, you need to lose weight and even now like, not that long ago i've shown her a picture she's like what are you pregnant so just like I think that probably has a lot to do with it because that's been since I mean like since I was young, before even. Like and I guess I knew how messed up all the comments were. Like it's been like instilled in my brain, so I don't really have. A lot of fun memories of like being bullied by other kids or anything but I guess that would be like the main thing and then, just like. i'm might have mentioned last time, but like. With getting down to like my fittest body and like lowest weight and then now being at my highest and, like my most unfit and also like being fat pretty much my whole life, like, I know how it feels society totally totally. be treated as a skinny person and then be. fat, so I think that might have like. An influence as well in like my thought process like it's just. Always negative, I guess, because I feel fat and, like, I know I am like it's. it's like reiterated what then. yeah I don't know, like, I know I want to be skinny because it feels better all around like i'm treated better it's not the excuse for all my health issues when i'm fat like a lot of reasons, you know, so I don't know I guess it's like. hard not to have a negative."
527.0,Provider,"yeah well and I also hear you again, as far as those extremes, you know them all or nothing like fat or skinny like those are the options fat or skinny. That are kind of played out to yeah I definitely think I mean how much. I mean what, what do you think is behind those the comments with with your family like."
9601.0,Patient,"Well, I know my."
527.0,Provider,Ashley your grandma I mean does she. has to she struggle with that you know eating issues as well and.
9601.0,Patient,"Bible i'm sure like she has her own insecurities with weight because she's had like. A bypass surgery or whatever like she has like a band i'm like man lap band, whatever it is so like. Obviously, she got that for a reason not not because she loved her body, but so I guess, some of it could be like internalized her own things or I don't know."
527.0,Provider,yeah so how did you respond to that Kristen.
9601.0,Patient,"I said no i'm just fast book and she was like I know you're not don't say that and I was like well obviously i'm fine enough to look for a minute. And yeah I was just really like triggered, obviously, but we were just like sitting at a dinner, so I couldn't really do much I just said that. Was bothered the rest of the night sure yeah."
527.0,Provider,"So then, did that in excuse me influence, you know how you proceeded the rest of the evening, or what you chose day eat or."
9601.0,Patient,"No just um my mood it didn't really. Do any of that I guess it's hard, because my the eating disorder that I really struggle with is binge eating so it's only making me fatter. But it's like. I don't know if it's like it's hard for people to relate to because i'm not starving myself and it's still feels like really out of control and it's less like. Harmful almost like. It seems to people like it's more just like shameful like you're fine you're getting fired again like what happened unless like urgent so that's awesome."
527.0,Provider,"yeah. Well, and what do you think. People need to understand about Ben cheating. cuz you are, you know you make some very valid points to kristin as far as. You know a lot of times eating disorders are just misunderstood, because a lot of people still think just of the typical anorexic person with the that's an eating disorder, you know and. And the you know very thin emaciated you know almost on death's door looking skeletal person, you know I think that's kind of. The image, a lot of people go to when they think about eating disorders versus understanding, you know bilimoria and binge eating and and those persons aren't they aren't going to look like that. You know they're they're going to look. Normal to overweight. You know, because that's that's part of the disorder, you know, and so I think it is really hard to understand that the severity of illness. In in those. died in those diagnosis is for people."
9601.0,Patient,yeah yeah I.
527.0,Provider,just stopped eating so much you know stop doing that you know and and I think it's hard for people to understand just the psychological you know piece it's not about the food with eating disorders.
9601.0,Patient,"And it's like it's what the food like activates in the brain, I think, because it's not about like I want to eat this because it tastes good but it's also like. A lot of the time for a lot of people like food is comfort so that's why it can be. taken out of like. proportion, or like in that has. That has to do, like I have that issue too, but also, I didn't like grow up. With like my family never made me food or like served me. A play or like taught me what a balanced meal was or showed me what a balanced meal was or I never had like a good example of like a healthy. Eating habit. From what not one person in my family so it's that also, I think, has a lot to do with it, like, I never learned. Before right was like influenced. As to what was right so yeah I think what's really situational, but I think the overall thing is that, like food brings comfort and what a. lot of people grow up in homes, where food is always reliable or. Next, that he steadily incoming whatever so it can be hard. Possibly I just like i'm. I would have like toast. Like buttered toast for dinner every day, when I was younger because my mom doesn't cook she'd be like find something in the kitchen to eat. So then, there was like oh i'm time where I didn't eat a lot and I think now that I have the freedom to like eat whatever I want, and I make my own money and. i'm more in control than it's like harder to have self control over it. Because I have some like oh i'm hungry and I want to eat this and I can. So I will because. I have that freedom, now that I was like always wishing I could have before. yeah so I guess, just like. working through things like that I would benefit from."
527.0,Provider,"yeah I mean it certainly makes sense Kristen as far as you know, it sounds like growing up, things were. Pretty restrictive, you know, not necessarily in a sense of like anorexia and restrictive, but you know it sounds like food was very. limited, and so you weren't always sure what you know where when you were going to probably eat and what you're going to eat and so. in depth, you know it's kind of that transition has moved to the other extreme, is now I have permission to eat whatever I want, and I, and I have access to whatever I want now. And so, how do I find that balance and know that. That I can trust my body that it's going to get fed and in nutrition to it every day, you know. And sometimes our you know and all our bodies know is is kristin going to feed me today or not, and so, depending on you know and it doesn't really matter what's going into your body it's you know that it just knows, am I going to be fed today or not, and in you know, in the past. has not been fed, so I gotta hold on to whatever she does feed me. yeah so yeah I definitely make sense, and so it is again finding that balance of you know, again of you know how do I. Trust that let my body trust me again that i'm going to feed it regularly and i'm going to take care of it regularly. And that I do have permission to eat things that I enjoy, because that is a you know that can cause problems if you're you know, avoiding things just because they're my bad foods. Well then, i'm going to likely bench more on those because my body is going to crave those and i'm and i'm again restricting those things, so you know how do we have you ever worked with a dietitian kristin."
9601.0,Patient,um yeah I just got done working with a dietitian. And I have a lot of handouts that she's given me but we didn't talk it wasn't like eating disorder focus it was just like General nutrition. So I I know about like a bounce play and things like that.
527.0,Provider,Okay yeah but didn't really address any of like the eating disorder behaviors with nutrition.
9601.0,Patient,"No, I didn't really get to address eating disorder with anybody."
527.0,Provider,"Okay, because you did you work on it, how much have you worked on before with Jesse."
9601.0,Patient,"We didn't really work on it much we just talked about mindfulness while eating, but we didn't really talk about eating disorder."
527.0,Provider,"Did you see how many sessions, did you have with her before you switched over to me."
9601.0,Patient,I was senior for a while. Okay i'm not really sure why the eating disorders never came up and then she also switched me to the mental health department so i'm not really sure why but.
527.0,Provider,"Okay. yeah well they kind of go hand in hand to do so, we can. Certainly, and sometimes it is you know what what feels more primary as far as symptoms going on, so maybe that's what happened, you know, maybe. it's more with maybe depression or the mental health side of things so that's. Maybe why so I don't know. yeah. So tell me what tell me what a typical day looks like with food for you."
9601.0,Patient,"um well it's very different, I guess, depending on my mood but recently i've been reading to eat my first meal until like noon, because I have a class from 10 to 12 and. I usually have appointments in the morning before class, and so I don't make the time to go get breakfast and I don't usually have stuff to cook breakfast. I don't make the time."
527.0,Provider,Okay.
9601.0,Patient,"So, usually to speak to a lunch, and I have lunch and then i'll have a dinner around like seven. o'clock ish."
527.0,Provider,"So tell me how meals are at home, right now, because it sounds like. mom are you just excuse me, responsible for fixing all your meals at this point Kristen."
9601.0,Patient,yeah i'm responsible for. Fixing all the meals for the household if I cook or. Just like funding for myself.
527.0,Provider,"Okay that's what I that's what I was curious as far as you know, is it just you guys just individually just fend for yourselves breakfast lunch and dinner in any snacks."
9601.0,Patient,"know it could be that way, I guess, if I like. gave up. If I just told him I wasn't gonna I wasn't gonna feed them anymore. But i'll go over either way. I think it would help provide my own space and. i'd have control of what's going in coming out and then I could just eat the things that I want to eat all the time when I was like. Social I think that's what worked for me in the past, when I was outline like how healthy is, I think it was healthy and was my lowest weight, I was really fit. And I was living on my own, I was able to control it was in my kitchen and the only things that were in my kitchen was like whole foods that were on my meal plan. And then. Whenever I went out to eat with my family or I went to my mom's house or my dad's house, I would have some pizza or some Mexican food or. Things and. That would kind of be my self control, but now that I live with them and they eat out every night or they eat something unhealthy every night it's difficult to have I don't have that self control, I have to sort of like. physically give myself boundaries, to be don't want to do it in the past."
527.0,Provider,yeah.
9601.0,Patient,So yeah it's hard.
527.0,Provider,"yeah well, what do you think would be a good shift in that for yourself to find a better balance kristin like. Do you feel like just making yourself a priority and saying i'm gonna i'm going to be responsible for my meals and snacks and i'm going to let. My mom and my sister do their excuse me do their thing, because I, I am going to challenge these negative thoughts that I feel about myself i'm going to challenge these eating disorder behaviors like really put your recovery first like. What are your."
9601.0,Patient,"I think I could try but i'm not sure, yet that I have like the self control I don't know how to gain some control, but I don't feel like you have any."
527.0,Provider,"What What would you what would you want to say to your mom and sister like if you sat down and had a conversation with them about what you would like to do and what you're working on, for your treatment needs. What do you think you would say to them."
9601.0,Patient,"Like us, to tell them I don't wanna be responsible for their meals anymore."
527.0,Provider,"yeah maybe that you're taking hold of your your health and your treatment goals and part of that is setting some boundaries with with meals with them. I mean it's up I think it's up to you to like, if you want to prepare a meal. and have enough for the family, I mean and that's what you want to do that certainly okay i'm not saying, not to do that, but do you feel like you need to take over more of. meal prep and meal planning for yourself versus. And you can certainly go out to eat and get takeout and stuff like that, but."
9601.0,Patient,yeah.
527.0,Provider,"Being able to balance that with with cook because it sounds like you enjoy cooking too. But also, you know finding a balance with takeout versus you know fixing things at home, you know not just. Being able to save some money probably. Eating out all the time and, and you know, depending on you know, there are you know. Probably eating out, you know there's a lot more, you know. potential to you know have more unhealthy parts in those meals too so. So being able to balance, you know balance your nutrition in a meal for yourself but also again it's not depriving you of those things you know if you want to have taco Tuesday and you get tacos in nachos for taco Tuesday. Then that's you know you have to allow yourself to do those things too because again. You know, restricting those foods that you enjoy or. are just going to lead the benches."
9601.0,Patient,"yeah I think it's just. something to be more like mindful about. Like. I guess like in the beginning of doing that. Like mixing the nutritionist. or dietician or whatever it was easier to like be like remind myself. Of those things, but as I like started seeing her last I stopped thinking about my. Like the balance as much. and So started to make sure I was still eating enough. it's kind of hard to like. Keep it in the front of my head like mine, I guess. I will continue to work on it yeah."
527.0,Provider,"Well, what, what do you what would you like to see with meals at home. Like would you like to be able to do more, family meals together, and you know cook together and."
9601.0,Patient,"i'm only one cook. So. yeah but I guess, maybe, just like not having to worry about what they want to eat or like what would taste good for them, because I do like. there's been times, where i'll cook and they don't like it or once it's prepared. They want me to like make special fixes to it, and then I have to like being the kitchen finishing picky like continuing to cook well they start eating and then I get to eat later and it's. Because I stressful, so I think I dress out a lot a lot about like what they want to eat so maybe if I just didn't have the responsibility be like a way off my brain right."
527.0,Provider,"Now that's what i'm wondering, you know what what's going to help you to be more successful with with food and with meals and. You know, food is it sounds stressful at this point for you and trying to you know figure out what what you want to eat a verse and then, at the same time, you know kind of weighing in what. What mom and your sister wife, but then sounds like they can complicate things sometimes as far as wanting things changed up, and so you know, instead of having to fix like three different meals. You know it's it's you know I, I wonder if it would be helpful to set those boundaries that you know if I do fix something as a family meal. Then any extras or anything that they want to do, different with it, then they need to do that for themselves and and you continue eating what you fixed."
9601.0,Patient,yeah.
527.0,Provider,What do you think about that.
9601.0,Patient,I think I can try. It see. If it helps.
527.0,Provider,"yeah what we're family well let's just talk about what was mealtime like at home growing up. Like did you guys sit down at all for for meals or was there a lot of conflicts or arguing or fighting it at the dinner table, or we just by yourself, like I think it's also important to understand, like the dynamics of of mealtimes for people to."
9601.0,Patient,"yeah um. my grandparents have always like taking us out to meals as a family, like in restaurants. i'm on occasion like every time there's a birthday will go out as a family to a sit down dinner at a restaurant. or sometimes if my grandparents just want to go out they'll invite and i'll invite like. A large part, or just like my their closest family and. we'll go out to eat but it's like sporadic and random sort of or just on people's birthdays and then at home, we never eat at a table my mom never really cooks. She never did like when I was younger, the only time she really. Like make dinner happen is if she like ordered pizza. Okay, so that's like normally I wouldn't eat dinner, I would go to school early and eat breakfast and lunch there and then I would just like not eat dinner or I would have my butter, sugar and cinnamon hooks to for dinner every night."
527.0,Provider,That was my favorite breakfast I eat that all the time.
9601.0,Patient,I was my go to meal.
527.0,Provider,"yeah. The thing, so it sounds like. dinner meal time was just very kind of all over the place."
9601.0,Patient,"know. When we go out with a family, it is kind of like it seems for me to be a conflict, each time like. The fat comment and then last time my grandma made a comment about one of my tattoos just like expressed on disgusted she was just like all these things that just. Make going out with my family like feel like a big chore now i'm like. I really don't want to go. yeah."
527.0,Provider,Do you have the option to not go for yourself kristin.
9601.0,Patient,"yeah I can I don't have to go I just kind of feel obligated I guess. yeah it's not it's not like require Murphy yes. I am an adult now, so I could train them."
527.0,Provider,"Well, the other thing i'm thinking is you know if it's not going to be a positive experience for you, you know if it's going to be. The negative comments about what you're eating or not eating or your way or how you look or you know things like that you know that those all impact. Your behaviors to and and again just kind of fueling those negative negative thoughts that you've you know have compiled over the years and just continue to add to so you know I think finding some ways to set some boundaries for you to take care of your mental health as well. And, or you know be assertive with you know with your family as far as you know, stop you know I need you to stop making those comments they're not helpful."
9601.0,Patient,yeah.
527.0,Provider,You know and.
9601.0,Patient,yeah.
527.0,Provider,"And you can be assertive and not you know angry and aggressive about it, you can you know just say you know I I don't appreciate that, like it's not helpful for me. yeah to hear those things and make those comments."
9601.0,Patient,"I. listened to last time my grandmother was going on about. How I left was. In preparation for the wedding and she wasn't there when I picked up my wedding dress I was with my bride my sister. Well, we picked out and. So my grandma had strong opinions on my dress and was like I think we should just go shopping at a new dresses. And she kept like bringing me dresses to try to cover it up and Mike kept making comments on it and I kept telling her no I, like my dress no i'm not getting any dress no I spent way too much time, like, I was very. Direct with her, and I said i've spent way too much time shopping i'm so tired of shopping and shopping for a month straight, this is the best dress if I don't if it's perfectly and not getting a new dress. You don't want to because she was going to have it. I was like if you don't want to have met for me just say that and i'll find someone else to have it, and she just like ignore those comments, eventually, I was like, why do you keep disrespecting my dress I understand you're like it that's too bad and she just said, more that too so. I guess maybe confronting the issue isn't going to work with her specifically but maybe yeah like you said just like setting boundaries and not going to dinners I don't I don't need to go hand. Since i'm not required it's probably better if I don't mentally."
527.0,Provider,"And I, and I, you know and that's that's really sad that grandma can't hear that, like you definitely were very clear and. You know and i'm sure your sister was helping you know, find a dress that she really like I mean it was her wedding so i'm sure she ran you to to feel confident and comfortable and your dress and something that she wanted you to look very pretty in and her wedding as well, so."
9601.0,Patient,"She did, and she said she really liked picture, so I guess that probably helped me to like ignore her but it's still like. affects me and I guess there's also the same like i've been dealing with it ever since I was. yeah a little kid and also a big thing is like she and my grandparents responsible for all the financials. They. own my house they pay for me to go to school, they bought my car they get paid by me on my school supplies like. I feel obligated in that way as well to like attendees family dinners and like sort of bite my tongue and. be respectful, but it is hard. To find like the line between like setting a boundary and also like. I don't know, I guess, I feel, like, I have to like kiss ass around them like either perfect child. Because I like owe it to them."
527.0,Provider,"What would be the worst case scenario, if you said you know, and I understand you know they're helping you financially. But that also doesn't give them any right to put you down and speak negatively to you, you know, and so I mean that would be up to them, I mean if they want to choose to cut you off financially. I mean they certainly can. But that's you know that's kind of manipulative to."
9601.0,Patient,you're.
527.0,Provider,"In so you know, trying to let them know in a loving way, I mean you appreciate the you know their ability to financially support you and. and be able to do the things that you want to do to further your education and career and things like that, but, but the negative comments need to stop you know I think in in letting them know you know i'm i'm gonna not come to dinners in family get togethers. As long as the negativity continues, because it doesn't help me and i'm really working on trying to make things better for myself. And I need you to respect that."
9601.0,Patient,yeah i'll think about it.
527.0,Provider,"yeah The other thing to maybe kristin is. You know if you feel like you're trying, you know you're struggling trying to get your words together or thoughts together. Maybe just writing writing a letter you know and putting things together, and then you know revising it if you need to, or we go over it, you know so that you feel like you have kind of an assertive direction with with your family on that. You know, so that it doesn't come across as blaming or attacking you know it's you're feeling disrespected when those comments are made and it hurts your feelings and those are your feelings to have you know it's not that you know and in. That that's how their words impact your feelings, you know and it's not them, you know it's I can't make you feel a certain way, but my my actions and my behaviors can certainly cause feelings for you. And so you know, being able to say that to them to. know when you when you make comments about my weight, or you know what I eat or you know that I look pregnant, you know that really hurts, you know, whatever it is hurts my feelings disappoints me, you know. makes me angry, you know, whatever because it's you owning your own feelings and that okay. yeah."
9601.0,Patient,"I guess I just like. i'm don't think about my feelings, so much so where that doesn't even."
527.0,Provider,"Which is where food comes in, to take care of. That yes."
9601.0,Patient,it's more about like know how i'm feeling. I mean like how like. My instant reaction like i'm reacting not like on how it makes me feel but more like how it makes me react like it makes me angry.
527.0,Provider,Yes.
9601.0,Patient,Something to try to think about over.
527.0,Provider,yeah yeah I think it's definitely making that connection of my avoidance of and maybe that's part of the barrier for your treatment is. You know I I don't deal with my feelings and I just I just do behaviors to take care of those and avoid on yeah mm hmm.
9601.0,Patient,it's the it's the same thing it's like it's subconscious it's very subconscious though so it's hard to like reverse it like I will have to think very. consciously and like actively to.
527.0,Provider,"intentionally yes. very mindful and intentionally yes mm hmm. So it sounds like we've got a couple things that we're going to work on. we're going to work on the negative thoughts. just making a list of all the negative thoughts and, if you want to you know go a little bit further with it, if you want to look at you know, like where those messages came from, or. Is that is that irrational belief about myself or is that an irrational belief. You don't have to, if you want to just work on the list of thoughts and and feelings about yourself that's that you know, probably sounds like will be a pretty big assignment within itself. yeah yeah I think it's also thinking about you know how do I want to structure my my meals at home and and take care of myself on a nutritional side of things too. And are there boundaries, I need to set within that or maybe sat down with my mom and sister and come up with a plan that. That helps us as a family, I don't know you know those may be things you know if moms one not to cook and that's not going to change, then you may have to adjust of how you're going to take care of yourself within that. Alright, so in see I think the next appointment. Is. October 6 at 8am. Does that still work for you Christian. Yes, okay perfect all right, and then do you want to go ahead when do we want to go ahead and add another one, then. yeah okay me. let's see here gosh I can't believe we're going into October, so do you want to do the same Wednesday the 20th at 8am again. yeah okay. Alright perfect I got it in there them. All right, and I always check in and see if you're having any thoughts to harm yourself or anybody else or any self harm behaviors.
