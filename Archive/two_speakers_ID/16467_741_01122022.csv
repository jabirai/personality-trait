16467.0,Patient,"So what. I do like two weeks ago, I think, so I mean I just can't I got it written down because my point I filled it out when I was in the plane, and then I had to reschedule last week because they canceled our flight, and it was just a shit show."
741.0,Provider,"Okay well and I got sick, the end of December."
16467.0,Patient,So.
741.0,Provider,"yeah that whole last week, I was. Like not here."
16467.0,Patient,yeah that's not good. When you're doing.
741.0,Provider,"yeah me too, it was. I was afraid I had cold me to get. Like. A good. So that's That was a relief. But I did not have covered again. Because that's not fun stuff."
16467.0,Patient,No doesn't sound like.
741.0,Provider,"Really, not as really. I was like. i've had it twice. yeah but now i've been vaccinated and booster so it's kind of like please don't let me again I did for a reason. But i've also been told that if you take the only thing that i've actually found that really is. That really keeps you safe from it. Is i'm. Taking vitamin D and calcium. If you take 200 units of vitamin D every day. they're supposed to not. supposed to. fortify you against it so. I started doing that too."
16467.0,Patient,that's good.
741.0,Provider,"Okay, so early warning signs of relapse they talk about external pressures and attitudes and thoughts and behaviors and and then I said they talk about the first question is about relapse related changes and thinking i'm. Like. You come up with a new method of controlling your use. Have you ever done that have you ever like thought well Okay, if I just if I just do. I don't I don't remember what your drug of choice was but for me it was like if I just do a little one."
16467.0,Patient,"Because I use it, I. tried, I tried that but I mean it just never worked out."
741.0,Provider,"Exactly exactly no it never works it doesn't work. No, no, but I would get these ideas that well Okay, if I just do it on odd days or you know, but I couldn't get through an even day without using either. You know, it was like what am I doing I was playing games. With myself. You know and. So sometimes we can come up with these ideas. That will condense it like my the one that got me was well i've never had a problem with alcohol, so I can drink. Because I didn't like alcohol I don't like the taste of it, I just didn't drink. Well, you take away all my other my other coaches. and put alcohol in front of me and I drink to oblivion so, and of course I don't like the taste of it, so what am I doing drinking it in the first place. So uh yeah. So did you come up with any of those types of things where you're thinking kind of changes before you, you."
16467.0,Patient,"So I wrote down my thinking change because I actually want to be sober now and if it's something I want to go for it, is what I wrote."
741.0,Provider,"Okay, all right. Okay."
16467.0,Patient,and
741.0,Provider,"The slant on this is really more along the lines of. trying to figure out what happened see right before you relapse or right before you, you. said that you, we can. guard against it does that make sense."
16467.0,Patient,"yeah I just I know it's not gonna happen now, I mean that's all. i'm passing."
741.0,Provider,Okay. So. That might be one warning sign. That that you are overly confident. That you're done. Would you go so far as to say you're never going to use again.
16467.0,Patient,No we're gonna do it over again.
741.0,Provider,"Okay yeah that that. could be a warning sign. Because it can sneak up on you and bite you on the ass. and Because I mean I I never wasn't I never intended to for you to relapse for us again either, and I did after 13 years."
16467.0,Patient,And it would change if I was on suboxone but if I got suboxone I I know nothing to worry about.
741.0,Provider,"So that's magical thinking dude. And a lot of people, a lot of people believe that just because you have. The opioid replacement. That you don't have a problem."
16467.0,Patient,"One no, I have a problem, but I mean it's controlled now so i'm not saying I mean it's."
741.0,Provider,"Okay well there's some behavior and some thought processes that go along with using. That the pill doesn't get rid of. Okay. So that's what we're looking toward trying to. um. Get rid of, and so okay. A little denial, so we got to work on it that's all. And so what emotions are attitudes change as he drift toward using. Can you remember what it was like late, will you will you lazy I was selfish. um."
16467.0,Patient,"I mean it all depends on like which part of my addiction phase two because I mean there is there are many reasons so many different phases, and I was on pills, it was just. Not being able to function without it, so I mean. selfish oh."
741.0,Provider,"OK OK okay. All right, did you ever want to stop using. and try to stop using that were unsuccessful."
16467.0,Patient,One and to stop using and was unsuccessful.
741.0,Provider,Have you ever had. Have you ever had a period of time where while you were using where you really wanted to stop and you tried to stop.
16467.0,Patient,But you were not successful at doing that. Just feel like treatment can do.
741.0,Provider,"Okay, so. Though also thought processes that went along with that, and if you can figure out what you were thinking during that during that time. i'm. Probably you're thinking of God, I feel like shit and I can't do this. But. But there were some other ideas I mean there was. Probably. Obviously selfishness, because you didn't want to go through the withdrawal. Okay. Trying to think, did you think that you were being punished. And you didn't deserve it."
16467.0,Patient,"it's been so long, I really don't."
741.0,Provider,Know yeah okay all right well and I see. Some of these early warning signs. We may not be able to snatch and. build a Defense against because you can't because you can't remember because you've got too much denial built up about it.
16467.0,Patient,No.
741.0,Provider,"I mean seriously, I mean denial is one of those things we don't even know where lion. Night so. It just it happens, it happens to all of us. Okay, other areas where there are clear differences between actively. addicted person's lifestyle. And that of a recovering person's lifestyle and and how we relate to others. So, in your addiction. What was your sleeping pattern."
16467.0,Patient,Just not sleeping much.
741.0,Provider,Okay well yeah good night.
16467.0,Patient,Did you sleep at night or.
741.0,Provider,I mean.
16467.0,Patient,I mean it's just the shiancoe off like the most recent one. most recent was just. sleeping.
741.0,Provider,To get your days and nights mix that.
16467.0,Patient,"yeah for sure I mean and then just being up all the time, whenever I didn't have to go to work I end up sleeping through the alarm clock because I just my mind was just gone. No more."
741.0,Provider,Right you you weren't thinking straight you weren't attentive. You weren't dependable. But now you are right.
16467.0,Patient,yeah.
741.0,Provider,"You pay attention to what's going on around you and you your. Your responsibilities and stuff okay see that's that's enough. she's right here she's. got to be in the middle of everything. move. And so, were you secretive. Like were you trying to hide what you are doing."
16467.0,Patient,"Well, first yeah."
741.0,Provider,"and Are you being demanding. or isolating you I know you gotta bend being dishonest that's just what we do when we're. doing our thing. And Okay, but those are not things that you do today right."
16467.0,Patient,No.
741.0,Provider,"Okay, so those are behaviors. That actually preceded a relax. You you slip into manipulation you slip into dishonesty for being more and more dishonest and you start being real secretive and trying to hide, which are doing, because you don't want because you know if other people see what you're doing they're going to call you out on it. Okay. So those are warning. signs that you're fixing the to relapse because. The reality of it is is it's a relapse the actual doing the deed. is just the last step it starts long time before in your mind. it's in your head and it's kind of like you said you know i've put my mind to it. So it's not gonna happen again, well, what happens if something in your head trips. Then you might. um. I mean you know, most of us are pretty hard headed. stubborn people. And when we put our mind to something we usually accomplish it. But the problem is, is that sometimes that mind shifts. we're not aware of it. that's why we're writing down these warning signs. Okay, so those are types Those are the kinds of things that. That happen like I know for a fact I become very dishonest and very secretive when I when I start thinking about using. know or when I get closer to using. Your first in the way yeah I become irresponsible and reckless. Like I started making I start blowing. People off. I start i'm just like. Not taking care of responsibilities um. So my behavior changes. No, because something's going awry in my head. So. Now numbers, four and five talk about those types of. warning signs so when we start. Having like. We get Moody irritable. And depressed hopeless all of those self pity is a big one. yeah and. Which ones of those do you think are probably warning signs for a relapse for you."
16467.0,Patient,Which ones have.
741.0,Provider,"What what feelings which what feelings, do you think would indicate that you might be slipping toward that."
16467.0,Patient,Just like hopeless oh.
