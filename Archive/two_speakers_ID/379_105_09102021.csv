Work is a shift, I guess, then doing doing more like. managing staff and it's hard for me to not. want to go and do work orders and fix stuff sometimes. So that's a shift. Yes, say. And I say in my relationship, sometimes I don't feel very welcome, or I don't know just really easy for her to just tell me to leave a lot of times. and I just don't know what to make that I just been kind of. Going with it, I don't know. it's don't know when. Like if she's being serious or not I guess like she has these huge reactions and it's. I don't know whether it's serious or not I guess."
105.0,Provider,"What skills, do you use to assess. Communication messages verbal and nonverbal, what do you use."
379.0,Patient,hmm. Try to ask.

105.0,Provider,I don't know so it's you ask a question.
379.0,Patient,"I mean oh yeah she's being serious. Or, and then it's like things. Just. Yes, I feel like being passive aggressive a lot of times and it's. Just rude and so, then I don't take it very well. and I don't know what other skills, I used to try to assess, though. Usually, if I just wait a little while still relax but that's not always the case. So. give it a little."
105.0,Provider,"weight, how does waiting. You interpret. The messages verbal and nonverbal from her."
379.0,Patient,It doesn't I guess.
105.0,Provider,What does it do.
379.0,Patient,Is give her some space sometimes so relax.

379.0,Patient,um that she's not mad anymore.
105.0,Provider,and So she's not bad anymore means what to you.

105.0,Provider,"And if you're not arguing anymore, what does that mean to you."
379.0,Patient,"um. That we're Okay, I guess. Maybe isn't the case. I don't know."
105.0,Provider,yeah so yeah that's huge on my page here. yeah I don't know. what's it like to not know a lot of the time.

105.0,Provider,You fill it in.
379.0,Patient,So.
105.0,Provider,And how often is that.
379.0,Patient,Pretty often I guess. It comes to people things like that yeah.
105.0,Provider,"So you're asking, and that was the skill you shared with me. And you didn't finish it and keep going, but in the absence of y'all are mad at me. Yes, things are fine and I don't have to leave. i'll have to leave we're not separating That was the original question, how do you know right you're like does she want me to leave her doesn't cheat. But so if she's not yelling she's not upset she's not mad she's calm, I can stay. she's not serious when she's mad she serious. I don't know. I don't I know you don't know. Think about you've been in quite a few groups. There have been plenty of opportunities. For skills to use. What are you thinking about during group. i'm going to assume your first responses I don't know. But pick something else the truth where's your mind, while you're there."
379.0,Patient,i'm usually trying to pay attention I just don't. Understand mode so it's time.
105.0,Provider,So I don't understand. And who do you think this group is for.
379.0,Patient,me.
105.0,Provider,"I didn't know he didn't understand, this is the first time, learning of it."
379.0,Patient,I don't know I guess I just. Do. Right write stuff down more. gonna have.
105.0,Provider,The stuff you don't understand write it down.
379.0,Patient,"yeah. I just forget it's like yeah we go over these things in group, and then I just I just don't think of them."
105.0,Provider,Well how's that working for you.
379.0,Patient,Look great.
105.0,Provider,"I didn't fit this stuff I have written a book and I mine, you know going on for years at bright heart health and I darn near do a different group every time plenty and little things out there to grab Ahold of to answer this question. How can I try and understand what this other human being is going through so that I can make a decision about my life. i've asked her. And i'm assuming she doesn't give a direct answer."
379.0,Patient,Right.
105.0,Provider,I don't know what the question is maybe you could share with me how you ask the question.
379.0,Patient,"I can't think of anything specific just. um. I guess, just like the other day I just asked her if she was really upset about that it was like. So maybe that's a little. that's not the best way to put it."
105.0,Provider,Are you really and this really mean legitimately meaning aka serious as in Nick is supposed to execute take action on what is said is that what you mean by really.
379.0,Patient,um yeah.
105.0,Provider,"Look how hard, I had to work to try and figure out that word and have a professional been doing this 27 years. This is your a difficult person to communicate with do you know that."
379.0,Patient,um yeah so.
105.0,Provider,"You guess so when, would you know what would it take for you to know that, so I want you to imagine right how you felt here today frustrated."
379.0,Patient,"Did you see how quiet, it was if I don't take the lead."
105.0,Provider,"Which is a setup, by the way. yeah constantly because you don't want someone to press it on you and you push back it's the setup, what do you think it's like for people to try and understand your inner landscape. When that's where intimacy is right there that's why people are together."
379.0,Patient,well.
105.0,Provider,"This here this therapeutic relationship. Can if I do a decent job of it can be a place to sort of work that out. kind of look at it go hmm. Maybe I would ask this woman here this one where i've got safety she's not gonna you know. Take anything checking it yell or anything I could say, how do you feel around me you could practice in here. And yes, today, took a different form, I wanted to see if you could feel something. with certainty. It was. drowning and I guess and I don't know drowning. What is it like to be you not knowing having some vague understanding about how the world works around you and people, I can only imagine. And no means of skills. to learn more. you're so invited your so invited anytime and group to say, could you paraphrase that I was distracted I did write it down, let me write that down again, could you say at 10 more times. Let me ask this person, you can do any number of things to try and get something from your minutes of your life so your minutes. I get compensated right. But those are you that's your time in there are you getting what you need from it. If not you're wasting your time aren't you. yeah I can't that's up to you, you motivated not but you saw it here, I hope you saw. What some people do they may say oh i've learned how to use my gut more. I i've researched that thing I saw about attachment formation why maybe she's an actress attached and maybe i'm an avoidant attached hi i've investigated it oh i'm it's very possible when I shut up she gets really nervous and scared and I shall time oh you that's too. Right group after group thing after thing empathy questions communicating how you feel clear questions, following your preferences and there's any number of things you could use. It comes down to motivation, whether you really want whether it's just so scary to have that kind of a connection and intimacy specifically with girlfriend. Whether you're interested. That might be a setup also so you can just stay out early baffled and confused by her. it's what you grew up with, and I know some of your stories sound, a bit like that. It can be scarier that kind of contact. But you'll know more. And you will be waiting she really mad now, am I supposed to go, you know you're you're waiting for someone else to push you around. And you don't like that. You said it. passively sometimes but. You know I take the the relationship with your mother, sometimes, and I use that I don't have a lot of stories from you, but. therapy is an opportunity for you. To understand. The inner workings of your mind and how it affects your behavior and your relationships your life satisfaction, are you doing it. Or is this somehow you've you've assigned to this as a task. And this is, for me, this is somehow i'm i'm getting something from this like this one of your voice she's she gets to hang out with me or I gotta go in there and listen to this shit right."
379.0,Patient,No.
105.0,Provider,"No, no i'm being sarcastic a bit."
379.0,Patient,yeah.
105.0,Provider,"button, but no Okay, well then, what is it. What do you get from it."
379.0,Patient,Well it's another thing sometimes but I. don't know.
105.0,Provider,"If I know you don't know. Do you want to know, and when you do you'll invest more you'll invest more. you'll write it down or you think. feel care. you'll do. And then I can come back and I can say. What are your skills that you use to try as best you can as a human to interpret this other humans message this word really. Who knows how she uses that word I use it a little differently than you would I had to get a whole bunch try and clarify what do you, what do you mean by that. Communication is difficult. it's complicated. So, what are you going to come away with here today, I know you don't know."
379.0,Patient,"You do yeah I guess. just trying to be more aware, I guess. Groups and things and i'm thinking things like that."
105.0,Provider,i'm trying to be more aware.
379.0,Patient,I will be more aware.
105.0,Provider,"Okay, and if you don't understand something do you feel invited to check it out. To not sit there in the I don't know to. I know what the topics about sometimes the topics just about you sharing your truth. which nobody else is going to know more than you nobody. Well, believe it or not, you worked very hard today it's not an easy thing. Because the prescription for how these were going changed today. You got through it. there's an opportunity also for you to see how your empathy. Whether you have empathy habit. mm hmm but you felt it so later on when you leave here today. see if you had any. it's not going to be the same as the superclub right, obviously, but it a little bit of it can be here because I am a human, not a robot. So she was here. All right. Well let's do this exactly like this again on September. i'm kidding sort of September 24."
379.0,Patient,Okay.
105.0,Provider,Okay at. Okay we'll see you then well seeing growth.
379.0,Patient,yeah.
105.0,Provider,"All right, be good to you, like you."
