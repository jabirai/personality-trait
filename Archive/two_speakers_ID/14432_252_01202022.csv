14432.0,Patient,"hi. Let me just. It was like started freaking out and then what we would took it we took the baby shark and then the dogs like. Little friend gc and he was walking with us and then all of a sudden, he just like fell off a cliff and like fell into the water like almost drowned so anyway enrolled in the dmz, and so we. watched him up get off my couch. No that's not the. envelope, you can use, though, if you know the correct address there wasn't an envelope in there cat. we're trying to finish up, we had to go, have you ever heard of doing live scans."
252.0,Provider,Oh.
14432.0,Patient,it's kind of like so my business readiness contractor's license through the state of California. yeah like this extensive background check. And like finger promo I thing like.
252.0,Provider,You know die and DOJ run.
14432.0,Patient,"It. it's just the battle, but anyway, you have to go to the. special places and do a specific live scan so Dr Chico to go to that and then cheese now we're looking for the paperwork to send it back into this state so it's just put our mail man's about to show up so we were trying to hurry to get in. Anyway, oh so I just got a notice from the doctor that she I guess there was there was issues or something going on, on Friday, so now my i'm just going to do the next meeting right or."
252.0,Provider,"Yes, the. 2028 it's funny, it is the 20th."
14432.0,Patient,"Okay um it's just usually whenever i've ever done my meetings I, for some reason, I know, everybody else does there's on different days so i'm not sure how that works, but. How does it work, because now she'll end up, I think. writing my scripts so my scripts have always been the same day that i've had group so well, she just write it on that day for me and not forget hopefully."
252.0,Provider,"And then, yes yeah and she's she's really good about getting in contact with us, or have any issues you can always email her about it, but I think it's because. She has a lot of people that she switched over to every two weeks. Okay, and last time we only have like two people. Oh, and I think just to make. It easier."
14432.0,Patient,"Okay, well, you could just put it in love with. down. A little better. I know sorry i'm trying."
252.0,Provider,To say no it's okay good.
14432.0,Patient,Okay.
252.0,Provider,The reason everything. Was everything with you.
14432.0,Patient,"Good um. Well, I didn't get I mean I since I like I had to go in front of the Dean, and my school like I we have about six finals in the end. And I Oh, I like pass with like flying colors on them all, now the last one I was so exhausted i'm not even kidding by that last one, and then Gary my husband ended up having like emergency gallbladder surgery there at the end so so many times, I was pulled out of school due to coven. Thankfully i've got all that. documentation because really I I had almost like I guarantee you I would teach the class if it wasn't for this, but I had like a hobby. yeah well on all those tests, you have to get a 75% I better. get my very last one I missed it by a point. Teachers like i'm sorry just kicked out and she was like the only thing you can do is also in a good word to the Dean, for you, and maybe you can get back in. The fall, the next time that we start and i'm like are you kidding me like I could show you the stock of I mean I know it was only one semester, but oh my God we did so much. Like our town got a freakin dominoes to new gas stations I literally did not stop having permanent kink net for like this whole semester, like, I never like I never even breathed it, you know what I mean like. I know yeah so so. I was so disappointed that was. Our so heart Romana first I didn't know, even if I was gonna be able to get back in so, then I was like oh my gosh I can't help you right now Gary. So I was it was just crazy but um. Luckily, after my one on one with the Dean, she was almost like let me proceed go back in but then she said. There was because there was about like six classes, that I actually just had to listen in at home and a couple labs and stuff and she was just like well. I would just rather have you like repeat it just for those moments that you missed and then you'll just be that much. more confident better because she said we're going to add on to those things and there's not there's never a time that you can catch up with in these programs like you have to get it. Not to get it the first time, and you better listen really good. You know, so I mean, in a way it's because gary's uh. he's trying to get my husband's trying to get a contractor's license so we have that date that's coming up on. February 2. And we we've been trying to do that, since July we finally got a date. So it's been so crazy so i'm kind of glad because I figured this will probably be the last break honestly, the last serious break from like now until August, again, whatever that this time this gap is because I bet you from here on out all forever like working you know what I mean."
252.0,Provider,So i'm trying to like.
14432.0,Patient,"enjoy the baby and and help with the kids and like like the first thing I did, because I was so behind on laundry I still am i'm not gonna lie, I still am laundry but, like everything was behind I mean everything was neglected so. yeah and then because of companies like I never had daycare the whole semester so i'm going to. Set up yeah so I knew it was a. Big time struggle to. I mean if I had my choice I would have still kept chuck pushing through you know, and I would have caught up. I know myself back. But at the same time, you know, I was just at least glad that they gave me another opportunity, because I know for a fact of three people I didn't know very many people in the class, but I. know that there were six people that weren't even passing the recent great didn't even have a see in the course but they so there was a lot of Muslims that actually failed out. yeah but I I just I think I got overconfident you know I mean even even my husband got overcome we both got confident, I was just honestly I still work my butt off, but I I didn't. want that, last week I was just like dude another I can't like so drained."
252.0,Provider,"Oh. Well, and it worked out, though. And you really didn't work like. Oh, my God, on top of everything."
14432.0,Patient,"Everything else oh my gosh like it was that was and I knew that it was going to be that hard but it took me until like because even up until like mid semester, I was thinking if i'm gonna pass I really don't know if i'm gonna make this. Like i'm not grasping it like I don't. Get like. I just the equations and stuff in terms of like the physics of it and and and I would confuse like. There was just a couple of things that we had to convert and I kept confusing and. I don't know that there was it was just really confusing on a lot of things. But I was so glad I stuck with it. Because, at the end all of it was coming together, and it was showing because then my. Scores were definitely like. going up, you know, but then again we went through another like you know, then Gary ended up with surgery so i'm glad it all worked out with Carol because I was so sensitive during that time. miscommunication thing, but I was like dude she really did you going to kick me out like I sincerely think that she didn't know she doesn't know any of us very well yet. doomed that I that I was, like many i'm sure many other patients in this. program trying to pull over her eyes or something."
252.0,Provider,yeah.
14432.0,Patient,But she was not so I was glad that worked out the way that it worked out because I.
252.0,Provider,"got to. That yeah like she really, really. But um."
14432.0,Patient,yeah anyway so i'm glad so have you been.
252.0,Provider,No i'm good i'm good it's um it's been it's been busy but it's been good yeah.
14432.0,Patient,"Did we lose people, or is it because she's put so many of us on two weeks now."
252.0,Provider,"I think she's put so many people on who we said, it seems like people have dropped out but it's not it's just that it's a weird rotation, even for me to keep up with cuz. Everyone got like a different rotation then someone else so it's just a matter of numbers of people in the group."
14432.0,Patient,"Okay, so just. The Now I do group two times that aren't am I supposed to have one on ones, once a week or my specific twice a week i'll remember."
252.0,Provider,Know individuals or twice a month.
14432.0,Patient,"So every two weeks yeah. yeah so i'll just i'll probably because now that i'm I am there was a one class that I guess, I was shy of that I was gonna I. was in somehow before I could be certified and get my certificate so i'm going to still try i'm actually going to go to my school tomorrow and i'm actually trying to figure out which class that was because I could but i'm sure that's not gonna affect us at all, but. But maybe i'll try to schedule with you right now."
252.0,Provider,yeah yeah before that we.
14432.0,Patient,"felt that maybe, but maybe if I do it like on the same week on the same weekend I mean that I already do the group on that same Friday if we work at like that, so that way."
252.0,Provider,"Oh, you know, like."
14432.0,Patient,Once every other week that I kind of think about and deal with and remember those meetings you know what I mean.
252.0,Provider,"Let me see what I have here. Okay, so we're gonna base it off next Friday right so two weeks from next Friday."
14432.0,Patient,"All right, let me, let me go to my account. So she was saying, oh yeah so. Oh wait so how's that gonna work is there any way we can just do our own next session on because. Either Well, I can either do it next week with you or do it on like the ninth or 10th or the eighth or the seventh, but I do have one of those days, because that's because i'll do group next Friday, which is the 20th but then I won't do it again until February 11. That makes sense right."
252.0,Provider,The.
14432.0,Patient,"right way, or is that too long."
252.0,Provider,"So. If you're looking at, am I looking. Good so if i'm lucky if I start looking at two weeks based off of. Next Friday, not this Friday next Friday the day that you grew up grew."
14432.0,Patient,Okay here.
252.0,Provider,"Oh let's do it this way i'm two weeks from today. Okay, and I have you were saying."
14432.0,Patient,So two weeks from today will be the second. One which one is it one of these are Plato pop up here. Sorry Cindy.
252.0,Provider,"Okay, no don't worry I can do the seven."
14432.0,Patient,Oh sweet okay that'll be good. yeah we'll get kind of caught back up again that way.
252.0,Provider,You want to do the three o'clock.
14432.0,Patient,yeah that works out really well for me. i'm just putting it in my calendar as well right now. Cindy.
252.0,Provider,that's a half hour. schedule that date.
14432.0,Patient,yeah yeah and then we'll just consistently.
252.0,Provider,tried yeah we can just everything.
14432.0,Patient,"yep at that time of three o'clock. yeah okay good that was easy for me, then, and then, once i'm actually doing the Friday things so yeah it'll be a lot easier for me to. Make sure that i'm. never miss."
252.0,Provider,So that'll be three o'clock February.
14432.0,Patient,"21 sounds good i'm gonna put it into right now. Okay first. Oh, my gosh so i'll be able to tell you, if whether or not, how my so gary's got his big test."
252.0,Provider,"Well, how the."
14432.0,Patient,president's day are you guys open on president's day.
252.0,Provider,"Oh sure I feel like I never have. holidays, so they exist on virtual work unless you take them off. Joe yeah. yeah."
14432.0,Patient,yeah.
252.0,Provider,"Alright, so we're scheduled we're good we have our two appointments. So, if anything, changes anything happens with school just."
14432.0,Patient,Keep me posted on you can always.
252.0,Provider,reschedule okay it's not a problem.
14432.0,Patient,"I laughed at three o'clock slot those should be I mean I should be pretty. I should be pretty good on that slot because you like a morning class or whatever and i'm lucky even that, like my kids at school, like offers and absolutely it's such a small school I think there's probably a total of like 50 or 60 kids in the whole school. And they have this like. After school program that they offer the kids so the kids can. actually get literally some of these kids get dropped off it's kind of sad Monday through Friday seven in the morning until like six o'clock at night."
252.0,Provider,"Oh, my gosh that's."
14432.0,Patient,"amazing that thing that I like is. That Brody used to get an I. have an IP for his speech therapy my son, but. They kind of kept the key he doesn't really need the speech anymore, however, he was super behind and all of those areas of study. The one on one he gets and I guess they're financially able to and not smaller school they're like super low low. Income area something like I drive them. To take them there. yeah anyway, so now he's got like. All a's and b's so i'm like. I don't know not speech or something because it's because they're doing all this one on one with him."
252.0,Provider,And he really means like.
14432.0,Patient,That extra I think a lot of kids actually need that to be honest.
252.0,Provider,"Right, I think, so too."
14432.0,Patient,"But it's really helping him but yeah I never have to stress, like, if I have some you know, at least at least they can just go the after school program right after school. they'll do homework hour, for the first hour and then after that they're allowed to pick like going to the cooking class or they go to the basketball program or they can go to the in the spring, they have like they'll grow the vegetable gardens, so you. don't have like an arts group they'll have so it's it's really cool program but I don't want to stress, you know, like, I can go there at 240 and pick them up, but if I have something come up it's not like, I have to be there every single day to 40 you know I mean."
252.0,Provider,"Oh yeah that's helpful, especially with. A lot going on with your school and every."
14432.0,Patient,Oh yeah. yeah even working and stuff for a lot of the working parents here.
252.0,Provider,Oh God yeah.
14432.0,Patient,"Let me skip this ad first. And I will okay what move your finger. Here, a handful handful."

From there i'll just be getting it every other time I guess. And then I mean i'll just go okay great Okay, then, if. you're Harold before I do tell her. it's all good I actually understood."
