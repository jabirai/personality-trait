10444.0,Patient,"But other than that everything's all good. yeah yes hey guys, what I do about the group thing that's those textures wanna."
480.0,Provider,"So mad, why is. Probably the easiest thing would just be called a virtual clinic ask for the rx team and get a. bridge until next time you don't agree. They should. be able to give you a bridge for that long, I mean they might have to you might have to know the pharmacy twice, but. They should that's probably quicker because I. don't think Dr Marshall yeah she doesn't do. bright heart on Thursdays. So it'd be quicker at this. point to do the virtual clinic."
10444.0,Patient,"Yes, I call him. And this was a missed call it was I missed the."
480.0,Provider,Point name is group yesterday because you were moving and you just need a bridge for your medication.

480.0,Provider,And then having the boxes is the pain to.
10444.0,Patient,"yeah. yeah i'm sure, but it'd be better so just knowing that they're there, and you know that that doesn't have so much to their line like like it does you know. With the timeline."

10444.0,Patient,"yeah you gotta do it all at once and bang bang. yeah and i've done the same thing I was a kid or later, you know who we get later, now we have to do it all. You know all that and then i'm another dimension we rented a. 10 months well stores thing like a little storage. So that helps a lot, too, so I have to like worry about leaving that behind like. to watch football watch Randy washer dryer put in there, because he comes fully. You know, stop it also will say that removes warehouse."
480.0,Provider,So did you only sign a yearly.
10444.0,Patient,yeah.

10444.0,Patient,yeah back home yeah.
480.0,Provider,Good.
10444.0,Patient,"I like that plan that's the game plan we'll see how it works out with words like daily put that up and send us on another they went from two year contract is used to be a minimum two years. But the word element that help us are to get right now the i'll be on my put my glasses launches barn. But uh but so yeah went from a 12 month lease I mean as soon as 12 months 24 months sign on bonus good 12 months. Look, for the same amount of money."
480.0,Provider,"Do you get the sign on bonus, because you already there."
10444.0,Patient,yeah but they want you to sign on for another 12 go. Daddy.
480.0,Provider,So when you renew it you still get the sign on bonus.
10444.0,Patient,"Oh, you still get us out because they want you to say."
480.0,Provider,hi.
10444.0,Patient,"And my wife my wife, but she gets born, I do see us like three sounds like."
480.0,Provider,me like. You both only sign a contract for another year.
10444.0,Patient,The 12 months yeah.
480.0,Provider,that's awesome.
10444.0,Patient,"Whereas, whereas before it was 24 months minimum. yeah yeah so, but now says the the help is so short, you know they take it whatever they can get."
480.0,Provider,And it's there's plenty of opportunity in myrtle.
10444.0,Patient,"Oh yeah you know that people go down to retire hell that's like that's like no god's waiting room. yeah there's plenty of. there's plenty of. neck and neck, you know motivation is gone capital of the world, literally. yeah so yeah i'll go down there and play golf or retire so yeah it is more opportunity there, then there is here it's just already attached, you know i'm attached to the residence and stuff here. So that'd be the hardest part it's not the mood is going to be happy to tell them by so."
480.0,Provider,"Does your wife also do what you do, or does she work in a hospital."
10444.0,Patient,Setting dinner yes she's a nurse long term facility.
480.0,Provider,Long term okay.
10444.0,Patient,yeah yeah she had long term so.
480.0,Provider,That term means they're like. More rehab not. Nearly dying.
10444.0,Patient,"No long term like they live there, like a nursing home. Oh okay longer they're gonna be there till they die."
480.0,Provider,I thought that's what you do.
10444.0,Patient,"I do, but mine is this my bill is split half half half rehab and half long so."
480.0,Provider,Oh okay that makes sense.
10444.0,Patient,Because that's what that's where the money is that is in the rehab side of it that's where they make the money.
480.0,Provider,I didn't know.
10444.0,Patient,"yeah the rehab side, where they're making wine and because they can talk therapy they charge you for this doctor, these are this yeah I mean. Charging. Yes, those like $4,000 a month to be in a rehab room and then vs $6,000 a month in a long time room where you get all that stuff."
480.0,Provider,"Interesting um. Okay, so. Before I forget. The financial balance the bill you got."
10444.0,Patient,yeah what was that about.
480.0,Provider,"I don't know because, on your chart it says no financial issues."
10444.0,Patient,"I know that that's what and that's the Marshal for me, too, but I just thought it was weird that damn I got another one that and I took a screenshot because I wanted you to see what I was talking about it's been it's been crazy right, I was talking about."
480.0,Provider,"Well, and i'm wondering if it's just you know how sometimes you get a bill that is what they build the insurance, but you don't actually have to pay for it."
10444.0,Patient,So i'm paying out of pocket.
480.0,Provider,"Well, but you do have insurance it just you had to pay until you met a certain deductible right."
10444.0,Patient,"yeah, but that was that was to my wife's insurance to see see I got another job or something so we weren't paying either way we weren't we were paying so pay as well i'm saying we weren't paying no insurance insurance when helping at all."
480.0,Provider,got it okay.
10444.0,Patient,"Well we're paying so so pay a price, the whole time. it's not like oh interesting."
480.0,Provider,"Because I don't know where that bill came from, because on the chart it literally says nothing about any of that."
10444.0,Patient,"that's weird I don't even want it dawned on me one if it's even like a real email yeah I mean you know you already got a wonder. But damn it says, all those damn things I get from you, like you, seeing if there was the. The sender and all that is from the same one that I get the site, because they sent me receipts like for this appointment. It will save me. And they're like last week, where I missed it they charged me 50 bucks which is fine, they charge you $50 for missing appointments. So. that's annoying yeah yeah so yeah that's why you definitely know i'm not gonna miss it."
480.0,Provider,"So now. Okay, we have two different systems for work, and so one of them does say that you have $425 do."
10444.0,Patient,"They don't pay for what. Is weird because they take it out, they have my card on file, so they like, they have to find it is already on there, and a run it without no permission or nothing which is fine, I get money in there to pay for it. But i'm saying I hope they don't run that for us it's all one because I don't know what I pay everything today have you know servers renders you know, like."
480.0,Provider,"Okay, so all it says under the alert, which is like right next to the 425 let's do it says at. A commercial plan terminated 731 patient is selfish pay until provides new insurance. But you said you've been doing self pay and. This is very confusing."
10444.0,Patient,"yeah I know that change this thing and they even sent me. The guy on who it is a person look like a guy in the picture. Over the finance thing he sent me something about the new payroll I meant the new payscale starting blah blah blah day from there and forward, you know I think there's A word or whatever it was I forget what it was. But they were saying, from this point for like September 1 two on you know, this is the new payscale.it up and that's what i've been paying. So i'm saying that this kid just came out of the blue normally they wouldn't wait till you get up before hundred something dollars, they would just tell you right away, oh yo $60. that's those hands over his weird that it got up to die without nobody know nothing about it that's the weird part."
480.0,Provider,Okay i'm gonna call financial person today because this. makes absolutely no sense to me everything i'm looking at makes no sense whatsoever. yeah I don't understand why because i'm seeing every time. they've charged you like. It on here but there's a cumulative balance. that's been on here forever and I don't know where that came from.
10444.0,Patient,Especially when they come out the blue yeah I mean. yeah normally any balance. know if you have any balance he won't be accepted into the group or meeting or one on one.
480.0,Provider,"Well, and that's why I was so confused because that's The thing is, they, let us know, every time if someone has financial issues and you won't like they keep people from seeing me for a $3 copay sometimes. So, like someone owes $425 they're not going to let you see me."
10444.0,Patient,or being group or anything else yeah your credit all right.
480.0,Provider,So that's why i'm. Here okay i'm gonna call Shelby about that that's weird.
10444.0,Patient,"cool and now it's just a misunderstanding and it was not, I was them have to pay it but it's Okay, I just want to make sure, first because it didn't sound like a you know normally like when they send me. The receipt they they stamp they email me a receipt every time I get off a group or every time I get off the wall one saying. And it, you know blah blah blah was for this session or that session, whereas that was just like boom yo this amount of money and we don't know why they didn't say nothing else they're just saying you have to balance, but when I go to tell you why so. And when I did call and ask the finance department, they never got back to me so. So, then, I was like well, maybe they just you know figured out, it was a mistake man every contact me back within I got another one and it went up you know with reports 1480. Other what hell is still going up i'm not a user and I have nothing that week so like damn it would keep going up."
480.0,Provider,yeah that's not right because. You still like I don't have anywhere that says for 60. Here it's still saying for 25 but even that. i'll figure it out. yeah.
10444.0,Patient,No worries i'm emailing them right now. yeah i'm not worried about it we'll get it figured out.
480.0,Provider,"i'm cool alright so let's schedule November appointments because I haven't done that, with you, yet. I no longer have 11 on Thursdays available because. it's scheduled out. Until thanksgiving but i'm not working thanksgiving. i'm. Wednesday you do group well. What about Fridays."

480.0,Provider,"Right and send me pictures of the place, I want to see."
10444.0,Patient,"come over here i'm older now, but let me take all these bars told all my stuff on my personal goals that I want programmer right over there and download it and i'll shoot you over some PICs."
480.0,Provider,sounds good.
10444.0,Patient,"cool, thank you, we appreciate you work with me and i'm sorry about that a little battles hey we're not purposes, you."
480.0,Provider,don't ever feel bad don't. Ever feel that seriously. No need to beat yourself up over it life happens.
10444.0,Patient,"But I look forward to, I look forward to it, though, so that's how you know now you're dodging them. Or do it so. The highlight of my week so just so you know that okay. Yes, yeah."
480.0,Provider,I appreciate you and good luck moving.
10444.0,Patient,"And if you let me know about that oh. Yes, don't need to call you still need to call separate from this."
480.0,Provider,yeah you have to call the virtual clinic I can't do prescription.
10444.0,Patient,"Practice oh yeah so i'll get on the phone with them, so when I call her whether I asked for what department."
480.0,Provider,That aspirin. pharmacy it we call it the rx team. So you can just say that. And then just ask. For a bridge.
10444.0,Patient,"Okay, good deal. alrighty Thank you so much."
480.0,Provider,i'll see you. Good luck.
10444.0,Patient,"Okay, what about next week, do I need to go to one next week Wednesday. Is I went there last week I know."
480.0,Provider,"email me, and let me know what they do about your meds because it depends on how many beds, they give you, because it would be easier, just to stay on the same schedule, so you don't get through. If you only have a week's worth of meds you might have to come."
10444.0,Patient,"Okay alright sounds good okay alright. Alright sounds good. Alright, thanks so much bye."
