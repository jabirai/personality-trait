741.0,Provider,Say you're supposed to hit your son's therapy appointment.
10692.0,Patient,"After this. yeah well it's another kind of zoom thing, but at least he told me this time because last time he didn't even tell me. So. You know, really upsets."
741.0,Provider,"All right, so you're supposed to be there now."
10692.0,Patient,"No, no, no, no, not now and, like two hours."
741.0,Provider,"Oh OK OK. OK, but at least you are aware that you have an appointment today right."
10692.0,Patient,Yes.
741.0,Provider,"Well that's good at least he's got communicating a little bit more effectively not probably i'm. Within a respectable timeframe, but."
10692.0,Patient,yeah no not really.
741.0,Provider,No cuz that would be like. Cooperation.
10692.0,Patient,"Right well also that would require some like I don't know pre planning on his part which he doesn't seem to know how to handle his schedule or oh I just suddenly saw I remembered I looked at my calendar Oh, my goodness, suddenly oh yeah we have the. therapy appointment at noon, and if you want to join like. Right yeah I told you that I wanted to be there at the first one, and you didn't even tell me, so I guess, this is better two hours early is better than after the fact."
741.0,Provider,"So right. Exactly. yeah. Well, I was getting nervous again the doctor. Over the next group that I do is has posted in appointment anyway, she made me nervous. And it's okay cuz it hit the appointments not until the group's not for another hour, but it made me very uncomfortable that he posted it. right before this this. out ya. know, and I was like. Am I supposed to be there, right now, am I double booked How does this happen."
10692.0,Patient,Something yo.
741.0,Provider,"Tell me a little oversight. But that's okay all right so and Thursday, you said that. You had actually managed to. capture on video. His abuse."
10692.0,Patient,"I mean abuse is kind of strong term but. yeah yeah I mean he was um. It was him saying it to my daughter. mommy is going to make us move from our House, you want you don't want to move from your House, do you like mommy and just stuff like that that's just very inappropriate. What else. yeah. my daughter is six knows how to. grow up so fast."
741.0,Provider,yeah they do.
10692.0,Patient,"So you know she's first grade and. He just does he I mean, he said that. I shoot heroin in front of them, and you know he just a lot of. lot of stuff that he."
741.0,Provider,Does not true.
10692.0,Patient,Right well now it's not true yeah but he yeah. He just shouldn't be doing that she has. Right yeah he doesn't have any boundaries either like. Who wants mommy to say who doesn't you know wants mommy and Daddy to say. Stay Mary raise your hand like Alan. You know that's.
741.0,Provider,Not that's not even right.
10692.0,Patient,So so wrong so.
741.0,Provider,"Okay. yeah so he is still trying to rearrange your world with untruth and. i'm not telling you about appointment in a timely manner. So what kind of things can you do to. Well, first of all, counteract that type of disruption for yourself and others and then manage the feelings around it."
10692.0,Patient,"yeah I mean. Today is is my day off of work and it's his day off of work so so fortunately I don't really have anything planned I mean i'm thinking is our meeting you know, thank goodness i'm just available. right that that time so that's a good thing i'm learning to talk to my lawyer actually after this. So, but so that that that hasn't disrupted things too much and then that for my feelings. I don't know i'm just. Well i'm happy that he at least informed me trying to look on the bright side."
741.0,Provider,gratitude outward.
10692.0,Patient,"Very ago gratitude, yes, absolutely. um you know there's so many other crappy things that he's done in that i'm just you know i'm not even i'm not gonna focus on this one too much i'll tell my lawyer, because i'm going to talk to him after we get off. And then just kind of you know, say bye bye."
741.0,Provider,All right.
10692.0,Patient,The resentments for today say the resentments we hold her the I don't know.
741.0,Provider,So kill us.
10692.0,Patient,yeah that's one of them. yeah there's.
741.0,Provider,A way to.
10692.0,Patient,"hell or something I don't know something no no that's. paved with good intentions, I don't know. there's a funny. sayings, you know, in a so."
741.0,Provider,"Yes, speaking of a did you manage to make a support group this week."
10692.0,Patient,On zoom.
741.0,Provider,yeah. that's acceptable.
10692.0,Patient,"Okay, I mean, I feel I don't know. I feel. No. No."
741.0,Provider,But you can still connect with the people.
10692.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
741.0,Provider,And you still get support they're just not right there in the same room with you.
10692.0,Patient,"yeah I need to. need to like. listen better, I have a little add, so I as you could probably tell i'm doing other things like. Just."
741.0,Provider,"walking around and. yeah yeah. Yes, I do and sometimes it's hard for me to sit here as well."
10692.0,Patient,I can imagine.
741.0,Provider,So.
10692.0,Patient,Sometimes I started fiddling with things.
741.0,Provider,I have a little little little chip thing that i'm asked with sometimes just to keep my fingers occupied and stuff while i'm trying to listen to what's going on around. Just little things like that.
10692.0,Patient,yeah.
741.0,Provider,And of course it helps when there's a good topic know something that you relate to. and Have you. thought about getting like a sponsor to help you work this that.
10692.0,Patient,"um. You know I don't know I have, I have you know. i'm i'm just trying to. The thing is well, one of the many, many issues is that I don't feel like i'm really. Quote unquote sober you know because I was raised, like old school a you know i'm so."
741.0,Provider,uncomfortable because you're getting medication assistance.
10692.0,Patient,"exactly like oh my gosh I mean when I got sober I was like. Are you kidding me that's not sobriety blah blah blah, and I would be, and I would be on my high horse to you know cuz. i'm I was sober for many years without it so. well. Well, for me."
741.0,Provider,"But you always know when you when you get clean and you're not prepared for the physical aspect. of being clean from opiates. Then it's hard to stay that way. And, and then, if you have pain on top of that, or if you have any other medical or psychological issue didn't have to take medication. So. What we used to believe in a you know being abstinent totally absent from everything i'm kind of has to change a little bit more like okay. Why not. Something that abstinent from things that change your reality. or absence from. All things that are mind and mood altering, in other words, they change the reality and how you see thing. Because actually the suboxone doesn't really affect you appear it just takes care of the physical craving right. So it's not like you're. it's not like you're getting high."
10692.0,Patient,Right right.
741.0,Provider,"You know you're not altered reality by taking it. You can actually function without listening to your body scream because that's really what happens is that the chemical imbalances in your body when you don't have it screams and you can't hear or do anything else. So, but I understand what you're saying that is kind of uncomfortable which might mean that you have to search a little harder for somebody that has a different perspective. and That hardcore perspective has run people off from the program quite a bit. um their lack of tolerance and compassion and that. served its purpose in the past, but no longer deaths. So I remember, I asked, I asked the lady in."
10692.0,Patient,When I was in Florida that's where I got clean like 20 years ago. If she would be my sponsor her name was snow and she was like I thought she was so cool she's like this she's a soul broad from the bronx and she had this thick accent and.
741.0,Provider,Everything and she's like you know.
10692.0,Patient,"That i've heard your story, but I can't sponsor you because you take antidepressants. And i'm against that I was like oh really she's like yeah that's such bullshit and blah blah blah like went off on like like. Okay. wow."
741.0,Provider,"But that's like that's like everything else that every everybody has their own opinion. and opinions are like. Well let's see i'm kind of. Everyone has an opinion and it's not always one that fits everybody else. um. Just because. Someone has an opinion doesn't make it right or wrong it's just their opinion. How they. How they perceive things. And if they have that perception the note you don't want that person sponsoring you, but I think, where we have problem is problems is that when we get into recovery we don't have a whole lot of boundaries. And it's Okay, for her to have her opinion and not want to sponsor you and it's not about you it's about her."
10692.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
741.0,Provider,"And like I said, you know you may have to because i'm experienced that stuff to where they can I get backwards and i've got a hair on my face and. When they can't allow you to do what you need to do to take care of yourself that you don't meet that person as your sponsor. So keep looking because there's a lot of people out there with recovery, who have a lot more compassion and empathy. For. The different situations and the different different chemical makeup of everybody's body, because let's face it, I don't care, who you are when you get off, of whatever it is you've been relying on to get you, through your Day and it doesn't matter what it is you're going to be depressed. Because the chemicals in your brain are not. they're not level they're not balanced because you've been playing chemist. Okay, so um. You know, a new all transmitters are right."
10692.0,Patient,"Oh yeah. Okay, and nurturing. nap enough friends yeah. yeah."
741.0,Provider,They have all the nerves. Right. yeah okay well when we start putting extra chemicals in our body.
10692.0,Patient,So for me.
741.0,Provider,"We shut down the parts of our body that produce those chemical. So, then, we stop playing chemist and stop putting these extra chemicals, though shut down those the production we stopped putting that in there, so all those levels are low. And it takes a long time and, more often than not. With opiates the body doesn't. rebound fast enough to keep people clean. And so we have to help. let's just others to it and there's a lot of people out there who are just not their body just doesn't function in a balanced way anyway. Okay, so, for whatever reason, whether it's because of genetics, or whether it's because of the environment we live in, or what it is. there's no telling what causes it, it could be the food we eat, no, no. That changes the chemical makeup of our brain. I mean I women guys who, through puberty and then they go through a period every month, where their chemicals are all out of whack. whoa. When our chemicals are changing so much, how can we be held responsible for stuff is going on in our body that we have no control over."
10692.0,Patient,yeah.
741.0,Provider,"But that's I mean that's just really what it comes down to you so. I guess what i'm trying to say to you is that number one we are doing the best we can, with the chemical levels in our brain. And not everyone is different. And so, sometimes we have to start a little harder and we just have to learn to grow, I guess thicker skin and be okay with somebody saying no. I didn't like that word either I hate that word. Quite frankly, it's not my favorite one. What is also one that I had to learn to use."
10692.0,Patient,"Right, not when you want to hear or easy to use."
741.0,Provider,"It was exactly exactly so all right, well, I think that's awesome that you made it to a meeting online. And my suggestion for this next couple of weeks as for you to kind of keep an eye out for somebody and maybe ask someone to be a sponsor. Just so that we can start getting some extra support you know. Because. let's face it, we all need support. We are not islands, we live in Community and. actually takes a group of people to manage life in this world today. And so that's really the point of what i'm trying to do is get you to start building a support system that can help you stay afloat can some that you can find a core group of people, and then have to be a huge group, just as a group of people. That you can talk to. So that when stuff happens. You can talk it out. work through have somebody help you brainstorm on solutions those types of things. Does that make sense."
10692.0,Patient,yeah.
741.0,Provider,yeah i'm talking too much you're not talking to no.
10692.0,Patient,No. Good.
741.0,Provider,"And let me ask you something else, what do you do for fun."
10692.0,Patient,"I well I exercise i've been doing this um it sounds so silly just dance I don't know if you. are familiar with that APP but it's fun I don't know I used to figure skate so um and do I used to do like lots of dance and stuff like that so. fun I do with my kids to although they've gotten less. less interested in it, and I also have some roller blades because I used to skate so rollerblading i've been. Making friendship bracelets. i've been just doing random things I. Just our arty farty stuff painted some some. furniture like old furniture like. Well, that I painted. cool thing that one I did. It actually I painted that full thing."
741.0,Provider,Oh cool.
10692.0,Patient,that's. that's about it. How do I there we.
741.0,Provider,i'm.
10692.0,Patient,A lot of spare time.
741.0,Provider,"Okay, all right, and are there any like group type activities or i'm. just trying to think how how you could meet more people, because not everybody out there is i'm in recovery and not everybody out there is musing. So you know, to get like a mix of people um I mean I don't know what is your spiritual life like."
10692.0,Patient,"Do you go yeah you know I used to well I used to be very active in my synagogue. stuff but I stopped doing that I was gonna I was trying to get. to rejoin the synagogue and they like, I know that. A woman who's in charge of the. dues, or whatever."
741.0,Provider,mm hmm.
10692.0,Patient,"The new members essentially was going to call me and never did so, I mean I guess. Just a reminder yeah I guess you know I could have like. I could have done something more, you know turn my nerve agent so."
741.0,Provider,"yeah well. I always I mean. There are usually lots of different types of organizations i'm with in a spiritual group. or religious group um but sometimes it just really boils down to the squeaky wheel gets the grease the more you. remind them of you're out here, and you want to be apart and um you have things to offer them because you do, you have your talents and and your God given abilities to share with them, and so you might want to reach out to that person again because that's a real solid place. To find people who are like minded."
10692.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
741.0,Provider,So I would encourage you to reach out again and and maybe even look for someplace else.
10692.0,Patient,"yeah I know I was thinking about doing that also um I mean well, I mean definitely. When I get custody or my kids for like. Hopefully, I think the plan is tentatively think starting November or December they're gonna i'm gonna start getting them. alone and unsupervised they're gonna start spending the night, I think, in December, and then probably by Shannon or something i'll have them part time as. I should. And then I will look into like. Sunday school and really joining and stuff so I mean it's coming I just didn't really push it i'm also thinking about maybe joining a woman's soccer. league or something yeah. You know I like to. i'm kind of an active person I like to do that it'd be kind of fun. Oh."
741.0,Provider,that's awesome idea you better without one. that's awesome.
10692.0,Patient,"I don't know I don't know how I if I cut or not, but. yeah yeah. yeah something like that. Right, it is haven't like. yeah."
741.0,Provider,"Well i'll remind me from here on out. One little thing for doing it. You know, get the phone number that's in the next couple of weeks. Okay, can call."
10692.0,Patient,"yeah and also a patient of mine is dancer dance teacher and she teaches adults, also because I I was like. Teach adults and so that's another thing, because I, you know, like dance, so I don't know why yeah i'm gonna do."
741.0,Provider,"variety of ideas and maybe you can. be one for a little while and then. Do something else for a little while like dance, and then, when it's too cold play soccer. Outside dance, and when it's nice outside you can go play soccer I mean you know you can."
10692.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
741.0,Provider,"All right, you've got some really good ideas and some we just take action on them, I think."
10692.0,Patient,And yeah.
741.0,Provider,And that may be just might need a little encouragement.
10692.0,Patient,yeah there you go thanks.
741.0,Provider,"For it alright alright well i'm in that and let leave you with that and let you go okay um you're you're not feeling depressed are you. No, no okay."
10692.0,Patient,"Thank goodness. yeah I mean I get. two options are and heroin very good antidepressants. I mean, I have my moments, but."
741.0,Provider,"Well yeah I mean you know we're still react to situations and i'm sure your ex jerking is changing all the time doesn't help. So, but I just want to make sure you're not thinking about hurting yourself. Okay that's what I needed to know. All right, well you're not experiencing any side effects. Okay, no withdrawal symptoms. Okay, you shaking your head no instead of saying no."
10692.0,Patient,No. Great.

741.0,Provider,"yeah. All right, you guys and I actually when we got off I emailed my boss last Thursday, and I said, you know it's not right. To think that they're going to be able to go to Friday groups, because the Friday groups or during the day, and all these people working go to school and."
10692.0,Patient,yeah.
741.0,Provider,"So I said, you know it would be beneficial. If we can find somebody to take it over and I think I may have because I talked to a lady. Friday who does my group. On Friday, and she said that she would she was really thinking that she might be willing to do some Thursday evening stuff so."
