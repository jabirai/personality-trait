2051.0,Patient,hey how's it going.
226.0,Provider,hi Happy New Year.
2051.0,Patient,Happy New Year to you.
226.0,Provider,how's everything been.
2051.0,Patient,"it's been good, well, I guess yeah it's well. here's a story i'm like. Three or four days, I think, maybe like three days before Christmas. my grandmother was in walmart with my my aunt and my mom went to go grab something she came back there was a big crowd of people and my grandma was on the ground unconscious. Apparently, she had a heart attack and then she had to go to the hospital, they were going to put a pacemaker in, and then they eventually they put for stents in her heart, so it was kind of on. Christmas was kind of different this year it was kind of flying by the seat of our pants and she's all right um got out after Christmas but uh you see my grandfather's got parkinson's disease, I think i've mentioned it before and. Like my grandma can't do it anymore like she can. Take care of them and so. And nobody really could do it, so I. wrote rose raised my hand so basically i'm staying night with my with my grandparents now because. My my my grandfather falls."
226.0,Provider,Constantly it's like late.
2051.0,Patient,"stages of parkinson's disease so it's like. it's almost like he has dementia, but it's even worse because he can't move, I have to catch him from falling and so i've got a whole new. thing going on here now. wow that's what happened and that's where i'm at i'm yeah it's kind of just a surprise, I didn't realize it was that bad like down there with my grandma. But i'm glad that i'm doing it now. Because they really do need help and it makes me feel good."
226.0,Provider,"Absolutely wow Oh, thank God, your grandma's Okay, you know i'm sure she's loving having help them, and you know."
2051.0,Patient,"Well it's cut down cut down on a lot of the falls. Down look, I mean you know he had to. It take them two hours to get dressed. And he's finally got over the whole you know I don't want you to change my diaper I don't want you to like look pop off. You could sit here for two I know you could do it, I know you can but it takes you two hours to do it just let me do it. You get it done and then you know you're not thinking about it so hard kind of button your you know his shirt together, because his mind is really just at a point, right now, where it's. can't remember what happened five minutes ago he's looking at stuff he doesn't understand and it's just. But it's made it easier for for him, I can tell a lot because and he's not fighting me anymore i'm like lyft pop off. i'm not here to tell you, you can't do things I know you can do things i'm just here to make it easier for you to do things so that you don't hurt yourself. well known, instead of him thinking oh you're following me around because i'm a little baby no i'm not following you around because your little baby pop off you fall. And you break your leg you're going to end up in hospital. And then, after that they're going to send you to a rehab hospital where don't people around that love you like we do so it's. it's kind of a back and forth and trying to get him to. to realize but it's it's been kind of rewarding it really has remember. i'm so sorry baby I know you're just i'm going to pay you for this and i'm like man i'm not you know what it I don't have much of a purpose anymore i'm searching for purpose, and you know my kids are grown and guys give me purpose. So it kind of works both ways. And it's just really been it's really been a real. weight off her shoulders."
226.0,Provider,Spare my God.
2051.0,Patient,"We worried about pop off, and I think that contributed to your heart and now now she can just relax and brief."
226.0,Provider,So what's the recovery. Time. For that something like that.
2051.0,Patient,"um she's just supposed to take it easy for. The month if there's a home health nurse that's going to come and try to do some exercises and stuff with her, she can still walk around she can still. Do stuff it's just she's at a point where it's you know I mean I guess she was probably helping my grandpa when he fell and just that constant worry. She just not going to be able to do the things she she used to do like she was feeding the dog and she then over and she got real light headed because because she'd been over and so we're just kind of taking it as it as it comes right now."
226.0,Provider,wow right. crazy crazy time so did you guys get any like how What was your Christmas like was it just. kind of.
2051.0,Patient,"It was just kernan like. Flying by the seat of our parents kind of because it was is my is my grandma going to be out for Christmas is she going to be in surgery is you know. What kind of a slap that sting we got together for Christmas Eve like we always do. My grandma wasn't there she got out Christmas Eve night, so you know we did that and we opened presence and stuff and. Since then it's kind of just been focusing on my grandparents because. it's kind of me."
226.0,Provider,"yeah and I love that you know it's given you purpose, you know, and I think that was you know I always think that has gone on with your son I think it's a great way to divert your thinking we'll have something that you can now export, are you focusing."
2051.0,Patient,"On yeah. Well, I told shiloh that too i'm like well you know it's like is this works for me because i'm not sitting around thinking all day long you know i'm. watching my grandparents and being with them, so at least half the day or you know I mean sleep at night but it's kind of hard to sleep, because my grandpa's up some 90s up every hour like he'll go. In like an hour as soon as I fall asleep he's in the bathroom again Washington himself off, just like he did an hour ago. So it's like it's. Up it's down some other I mean, but then other nights it's just a couple times so it's it's just kind of a learning curve kind of with them, I took care of my my great grandfather. When he had dementia like 1015 years ago, but at least he could he could walk he could like with dementia, he was yeah he didn't know what was going on, sometimes, but with my path ah it's like it's that it's like dementia it's eating his brain, but he also care. can't walk he's like really losing his ability to move and."
226.0,Provider,"yeah yeah because it affects the motor skills, you know that area and the brain is affected so."
2051.0,Patient,"But like I said he has said, some things to me like Oh, you know what it's been a whole lot easier, I can think better since you've been here. So it's like. You know those little things make me feel good that you know it's like okay well, maybe sitting there in focusing on trying to button up his shirt for two hours is making his brain go nuts and me doing that and it just being done, he can not have to. Focus so hard on thinking about. Doing those kinds of things."
226.0,Provider,"Well, good for you like, I mean you know tough situation, but you know, look at all that you're able to bring in good and amazing."
2051.0,Patient,"I mean it's like nobody I mean everybody else has, like all the other grandkids eight you know my cousin scotty he's got a job and. There was just nobody else that you know, really. had the time to do it and i'm like okay well you know i'm here, I can. I ain't got nothing to do, and they are my grandparents and. You know it's just I mean it was either this or what are we going to do here, are we going to try to make send them to a home 10 pap auto home and my grandma and that's going to cost a lot of money to do that and. You can have to sell a house this that the other thing i'm like just. i'll do it i'll do it and it'll be fine and then nobody has to think about this that and the other thing won't think about all that later. Okay yeah. So it's been cool in that respect yeah."
226.0,Provider,"i'm like are you feeling overall just in general, like how's it going."
2051.0,Patient,"i'm feeling good I haven't had time to really. You know. I thought about my son, and you know it's the last month, this is, this is something new that i'm. my sister. Talk to my wife and said that you know Dakota wants to see you. wow and make cookies um, but it was specifically. I wasn't invited That was the caveat that I. It was only her and not me I wasn't allowed to go. That was cool for her, and it was."
226.0,Provider,She did see him so it happened.
2051.0,Patient,He got to see him but.
226.0,Provider,I will ask.
2051.0,Patient,"Specifically, not to come."
226.0,Provider,But your wife got to see him. yeah.
2051.0,Patient,"Oh wow my date, you know. I think that. They didn't want me to go, because they knew i'd ask hard questions. Because we didn't answer anything you like child told it we love you we need you in our life, but it was like it was like here you go this is our Christmas for you type thing or something I. I don't know you know what I mean and and. yeah it's just it's it's confusing I got all these people telling me i'm a good person and. doing all these things and it's like a you know it matters it matters what those people. say, but you know I just wished that my son could see that I do have good in me, you know what I mean it's. And, and my cousin Christie the one that they're staying with that he's staying with finally texted us after all of this shit happen, two years later. hey i'm just wanted you to know I haven't talked bad about you this that and the other thing, and so I got on, and I said look. i'm sorry for going off i'm sorry for getting mad I apologize for everything, nobody needs to be sorry I was in a bad place my dad had killed himself, and I was on drugs and. And it was just a bad situation and I apologize to everybody, for it and i'm. So that happened and."
226.0,Provider,wow there's some big huge stuff that's happened since the.
2051.0,Patient,wet yeah.
226.0,Provider,My my God.
2051.0,Patient,"me it kind of hurt. You know, because, like it was they specifically asked me not to either. And shiloh broken out up to. christy she said, you know because I didn't go back and talk about anything that happened but shiloh felt it was important that she knew that. Nobody had told us that he was going to move out there, that it was like a total surprise to us and and. And then, Chris he says well and then she mentioned that you know she had solid to code and they had specifically asked for me not to be there. and Chris he says Well he so Dakota so non confrontational and this and that the other thing and i'm like well you know what are we gonna keep telling around this I believe that's why they. didn't want me to be there because I would have pulled him aside and said Dakota. what's going on, you know what I mean and I. It just hurts it's like you know I mean i'm trying here and."
226.0,Provider,So.
2051.0,Patient,"I never argued with my son, you know what I mean I don't get why it's like he thinks i'm gonna. jump on him or something like that it's, not that I really think it is that they don't want to talk about what's going on and they know me being his father i'm not going to just sit there and act like nothing's going on. And I guess he's not comfortable enough to answer those questions yet. So. i'm waiting till he is I guess you know it's. So I can't do that I can't I can't go to my son and just act like nothing yeah. let's make Christmas cookies and know why haven't you spoke to us for two years."
226.0,Provider,yeah that would be we're.
2051.0,Patient,Not saying your main idea. And I think that's what they're trying to avoid so I don't know but but christy called and are not called but she texted it's kind of two years too late. um yeah and shiloh got to see him so that's something.
226.0,Provider,So how like How was it for shiloh to see him like what. Like did they just make cookies as their conversation.
2051.0,Patient,Just me cookies. She told him before before he left that you know hey we love you and we need you. We need you to need us in your life. and Was it.
226.0,Provider,"So, you know as as painful, as that is for you and it's it is painful you know to be to be excluded and not have any understanding."
2051.0,Patient,"Everybody has has got to see him now. Except for me i'm the only one, now that."
226.0,Provider,"So. it's a huge step that's huge what happened, even though you weren't able to see him so it's it's actually moving in the right direction and it might not feel like that for you."
2051.0,Patient,know it feels like it's moving in the right direction.
226.0,Provider,It does I just.
2051.0,Patient,wish I was included in it.
226.0,Provider,"Is all so here's here's the way to think about this it doesn't mean that in the next, the next time that you will be excluded. The next time you might be included or the time after the time after. So you know, unfortunately. your son doesn't know how to."
2051.0,Patient,"express his feelings to me. yeah I am and i'm not going to be that guy, though, and I think everybody knows that i'm not gonna i'm not gonna not. confront my son. i'm sorry, there are times in life when you have to confront things i'm not a confrontational guy I don't start fights I never fought with my family before this i'm not a fight starter, you know the Madison i'm person i'm mad at his knee. on time, you know what I mean so it's like but i'm not going to just. You know so that's what they're expecting it's not going to ever happen, you know what I mean i'm not ever going to just like just. act like these two years of complete and total nothing never happened, I mean yes i'll move on, but I kind of would like to know. You know, give me a little bit of wine."
226.0,Provider,"yeah I agree, I mean it would be really strange just kind of pretend like."
2051.0,Patient,yeah yeah you know.
226.0,Provider,"nothing stops and legs. yeah you know, like the big elephant in the room. Exactly okay just."
2051.0,Patient,"Like they know they all know that I am not going to just sit there and let that elephant. stay there, you know what I mean if the next time I see my son i'm going to ask him, you know it's just I can't not so."
226.0,Provider,How much. How much time did you spend with shiloh along with.
2051.0,Patient,"You know, half an hour an hour."
226.0,Provider,Probably. Any conversation at all.
2051.0,Patient,nothing other than like I said she told him before he left it we you know we love you and we we need you to need us.
226.0,Provider,did your daughter Sam know. specifically asked for shiloh.
2051.0,Patient,"I think, so I don't know if he set it up or my sister set it up, but he was Okay, with it, you knew that Charlotte was coming yes. Okay, and that. it's weird yeah and, as far as the sister part goes um when we were texting back and forth with Chris D my cousin where he lives and um. there's only a few texts back and forth, but she said something to the effect that you know Dakota didn't get along with Andrea or something like that and we don't understand well, what do you mean didn't get along why what do you want like. What do you mean by that, like their their brother and sister they gotten arguments it wasn't like they they fought or something it's just this is it just doesn't make sense it doesn't add up it's it's weird you know why leave anybody out to. You know."
226.0,Provider,"No kidding you know, like."
2051.0,Patient,"it's like I, are you just like completely in denial about where your lineages or like you know what I mean is it yeah. it's hard it's like Oh, you know what I mean but it's progress because she gets to see him and."
226.0,Provider,well.
2051.0,Patient,"I don't think he has a problem I really don't believe video, the problem with his sister I. I don't know what's going on and it's just hard to. Keep thinking about it it's."
226.0,Provider,yeah and maybe it was yeah maybe he just needed to just see shiloh and because you know that was like a test run.
2051.0,Patient,You can become comfortable with it or.
226.0,Provider,"yeah exactly and that everybody could honor that he said, I just want, I just want mom you know just kind of."
2051.0,Patient,"But after two years, your mom is longing for some kind of answer you know, and I mean he's not stupid he's a smart kid. I mean, he he is. willingly living in a world work he believes this is okay and. it's. it's just not like in the in the texts that christy service it's like she said. Because shiloh said well you know I got to see him and make cookies and and this that and the other thing and like she said, you know he's non confrontational and she said well what you need to do now is just when you see him just enjoy him for that moment. Which is like yeah but like yeah that's easy for you to say you know what I mean after two years of assimilating him into your hair and we now you're comfortable with my son you're telling me to just. not ask any questions and just enjoy his company like he's a distant relative or something come on i'm not going along with this farce, and you know. that's where i'm at. You know, everybody else can go along with it, but i'm not."
