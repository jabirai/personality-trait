4828.0,Patient,Well that's quite a ways from your House.
252.0,Provider,"well. And the great part about it, you know, is being. Older and not having any kids anymore being able to do you know the things like that that you want to do and experience and try and."
4828.0,Patient,good for you.
252.0,Provider,"yeah so it's another adventure, I am not willing to give up right heart, I won't give up right heart at all I enjoy working with everybody that I work with including you so. i'll be working with bright heart on the weekends and in the evening time."

4828.0,Patient,Oh hey.
252.0,Provider,Go so um i'll say closer i've been investigating and looking and. You know.
4828.0,Patient,That is where I grew up I grew up in sacramento.
252.0,Provider,Oh Nice. Nice. So you're on its journey. trying to figure out. what's best for you.
4828.0,Patient,"You know Rebecca I i'm just tired i'm so tired of waking up every single day and saying I don't want to start another day. yeah and and that's where i'm at, and it seems to be getting worse, is not getting any better on. My husband says, all I ever do is complain, which I probably do. But. it's an honest complain."
252.0,Provider,To tell you feel.
4828.0,Patient,"that's how I feel that's not how he feels that's how I. And I I realized a long time ago I can't change anybody else right, I can only change myself. And i'm not happy with that other person, that is not willing to change."
252.0,Provider,well. The great part about it is that number one you're thinking with a clear mind. you're trying to figure out how you can. be happy and what's best for you. Right.
4828.0,Patient,"Yes, that that's what i'm doing, but the unselfish part of me is seeing that I don't want to destroy my family that I worked so far for my house that I worked so hard for. My home. And I just feel like i'm being selfish if I make that decision and. In it, it just it rips everything apart, but at the same time I can't wake up every single morning I don't want to do this anymore."
252.0,Provider,"Or maybe it's really kind of started putting everything back together. You have a you know, a beautiful house your children have grown. And don't you think that they would rather see you with a smile on your face and being genuinely happy. Because that's what really makes a family whole."
4828.0,Patient,"know and and I agree, the thing that I, I am very frustrated about is that no matter how much I talked to my husband and plead with him he's not going to give me this House and I know I live in California it's part mine. He says. He says he's not selling you're not going to sell the House so i'm prentice thought."
252.0,Provider,"Have you been. Considering, I mean have you been thinking about getting a divorce is that what you're. Here, I just want to leave with."
4828.0,Patient,Separation I don't want it force. Because I don't want to give up everything that i've. earned in 40 years.
252.0,Provider,Okay.
4828.0,Patient,"that's mine I I paid dearly for it. But. I don't know Rebecca i'm just i'm at a point to where I just I don't feel. happy. I don't feel I actually I don't feel I don't feel anything. I just wake up in the morning and. look forward to going to bed, this morning I was up at one o'clock in the morning i'm not sleeping. Very gave me a higher dosage of the. there's a pain. And so i'm going to try that tonight and see about that helps out but i'm. i'm just very, very depressed and I just I don't sleep so i'm tired. Only thing I enjoy is my puppy and right now he's eating me alive. That chewing stage to all he wants to bite."
252.0,Provider,So what happened when you went on your trip.
4828.0,Patient,"and I did a lot of walking on the beach with the dog. I took him with me, I did a lot of walk. I parked my car and I did not get in my car for four days I just walked everywhere, I needed to go."
252.0,Provider,And while you were doing that was their sense of peace.
4828.0,Patient,"When I first decided that I was going to go, I felt I did have a sense of peace, but once I actually get it in there. I had a sense of regret because. I didn't know if I was doing the right thing or not."
252.0,Provider,So it was scary venturing out to try new things. You know.
4828.0,Patient,"yeah I. I had a really nice room I. sat and watched the ocean. That was peaceful with all the servers out in the water. and The weather was 65 degrees, so it was gorgeous."
252.0,Provider,Oh wow.
4828.0,Patient,"yeah. So, but I came home to the same thing and that that's that that's the disappointing part. And if somebody could just do give me a magic wand and say Jerry this is how it's been a B and you just have to learn to live with it and learn to deal with it. And just be happy there's got to be a happy pill out there somewhere that I could."
252.0,Provider,ever really wish.
4828.0,Patient,I know.
252.0,Provider,You know Jerry happiness comes from within us and if we're not doing things it's a really. Water that flower. It just is dorman SEC.
4828.0,Patient,yeah.
252.0,Provider,"doing things like getting out and doing things that you like to do there's nothing wrong with that you are clean and sober woman. You get to go out and take adventures and do things you know, I understand that you don't want to give up your House and your marriage, I totally understand that, but who says, you have to. If you're out there and you're doing things and you're taking trips and you are exploring and adventuring and finding what happy means to you. there's nothing wrong with that."
4828.0,Patient,"yeah, I guess, I just have to find out what happy does me."
252.0,Provider,What does that look like and really explore that for you. You know.
4828.0,Patient,yeah that's going to do.
252.0,Provider,"Because i'll tell you you're right you can't change anybody else, no matter how hard you try, but what you can do is that you can water your own flowers. And you can figure out what that means for you and you never know what that will create for you."
4828.0,Patient,"Yes, this."
252.0,Provider,"And it's infectious. Just like you know sadness is infectious or you know, having a broken heart or anger, you can feel it when somebody is angry or is always around you. You know same thing when you start finding your happy you start. Having a smile on your face more you start. You know your energy is light."
4828.0,Patient,"yeah like it just like it just. It passed. get past him, I guess, I don't know."
252.0,Provider,"Well it's not really about getting past him but it's really about doing it for you and really looking at it like. Okay i've sat in this House long enough. i'm cleaning server. i'm going to do things to nurture myself internally, and it is self care to really take a look at the things and try the things that you want to try he's either gonna come on side of you and say oh my God, you know who is this person. she's doing things that really are good for."
4828.0,Patient,i've been clean and sober now for about one year and it has been one winner. And he reminds me every single day that i'm the trunk lines me every single day that i'm a drunk.
252.0,Provider,"No, no you're not a drunk getting more. you're cleaning server woman. Yes, alcohol is a part of your past but it's not a part of who you are today or your future."
4828.0,Patient,So if I can. Just zoom call and I just get in my car and I leave I shouldn't feel bad about that.
252.0,Provider,"I don't think you should you don't have small children at home, no, you have you, you have your marriage, you have your House, you have your puppy you have these things, but really you have created your family they're grown. Why can't you do things for you, that nurtures you that's what i'm doing."
4828.0,Patient,good for you.
252.0,Provider,"What you gotta do to the thing is, is when we're we've been in a situation for so long, I mean you've been in this marriage for 40 years you've been in this life style for 40 years. Right not saying give up your House i'm not saying give up your marriage i'm saying within it focus on you don't focus on trying to change him because that's not going to happen focus on doing and finding you what makes you happy. You know, he doesn't want to sell the House buying buying that doesn't mean that you have to be a prisoner in though in your own home."
4828.0,Patient,"I know and that's how I know. I tried to make a deal with him that we just tend to live a separate life in the House. yeah that's not that's not gonna work out at all. I guess after 40 years is impossible, but. he's always. Just as always here. Even though he's not here he's always here. right when he is here he's not here he's not here for me."
252.0,Provider,"he's. Just he's got to get to a point where he's willing to work on his own self and learn how to forgive learn how to get out of the past and move forward, but you can't do that for him, but he can certainly watch you doing it. he's either gonna gonna pick it up and say I want that I want that happiness because, deep down inside i'm sure he does. But he's so filled with you know anger and things you know it's like ever seen that movie the war of the roses."
4828.0,Patient,Yes.
252.0,Provider,it's like you get stuck in the problems you don't see the solutions. And so we've we stop engaging in the war. learn to accept them where they're at. and work on us internally. find our happiness.
4828.0,Patient,You deserve it after a year and a half of you right hurt she might be a little bit further along.
252.0,Provider,"Part of that has to do with the work you put into it, too, so if you're not building your sober support system and you're staying in the House and not doing anything to you know find what happy means to you why wouldn't you feel sad. Why wouldn't that continue to grow."
4828.0,Patient,As. Well i'm gonna get up and i'm going to go take a walk my puppy outflow. and i'm not even going to clean the House today.
252.0,Provider,"there's nothing wrong with that just be you love you do things that make you happy and find that peace within you if you want to take a road trip take a road trip. want to go get your nails done get your nails done whatever that looks like do things and explore for you. Because you've been in a marriage for over 40 years, who is Jerry."
4828.0,Patient,I lost her lost her a long time ago.
252.0,Provider,When it's time you find.
4828.0,Patient,In a very new to bury her in football. and Now that I don't have a problem. stoking funder I can't find her in her.
252.0,Provider,"You know, because after 40 years of being a mother and wife and taking care of everybody else we forget how to take care of ourselves. Were. No debate."
4828.0,Patient,"I think that. getting a job is an option. That. I got married at it at 22. i'm out of the out of the 40 years that we've been hearing down work seven years out of applying otherwise I stayed at home and took care of the children and my husband. So maybe you. There seems to be plenty of jobs out there, nobody wants to work any full burn."
252.0,Provider,"You know what we started doing on the side, this is this is and it's fun it's the craziest thing but it's fun. Getting out and just door dashing. it's something so simple but it's fun."
4828.0,Patient,yeah.
252.0,Provider,I mean it's literally you're picking up other people's orders and dropping them off at the front port. Right. And you're making a little bit a little bit a little bit and it adds up and it adds up but you're out of the House you're focusing on other things. Right. And you don't have to. have experience you have experienced driving.
4828.0,Patient,And I do.
252.0,Provider,"it's just it's something different, I do it, you know with my adult kids. And it's it's just fun. We listen to music and we just. We drive pay attention to the map and the little."
