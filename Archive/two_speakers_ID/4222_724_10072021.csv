4222.0,Patient,yeah I do just like I say I was completely out of it after today's so anyway sorry i'm kind of just kebab related you're getting. together and work.
724.0,Provider,take a few seconds relax a little bit.
4222.0,Patient,"So, are you doing that."
724.0,Provider,"All right, can't complain. My daughter's birthday today."
4222.0,Patient,"Oh, really."
724.0,Provider,"That sense of time with her was good, we have a party for this weekend so. sucks having a birthday she's for."
4222.0,Patient,So for. me it's got. To get three two or three. Two to have.
724.0,Provider,A girl so today was she's the older so today was.
4222.0,Patient,right on.
724.0,Provider,"kicked out of school hung out for a little bit I mean I worked, the bulk of the day, so."
4222.0,Patient,yeah.
724.0,Provider,i'm out with her hair and their ago we had a bunch of cool stuff fish tank and all kinds of cool stuff that will give to her on Sunday.
4222.0,Patient,"Or you work your hours man I can't remember you said you had, if I remember correctly said you had about 50 patients or something like that."
724.0,Provider,"It that's what it says, but I, but I haven't seen maybe I see 50 pages i'm not sure I case a lot of changes, you know almost daily I have new people assigned to me that. i'll go to like meet them for like their initial assessment and they won't show and then they'll fall off and then i'll have other people's transferred over so it's hard to tell. I pricey consistently like the same people from my groups, maybe about 30 or 40 and then a bunch of like random you know drop in here or there, so."
4222.0,Patient,I gotcha okay.
724.0,Provider,"any given day typically scheduled like a session for every hour then i'm on whether or not people show up in various I think the beginning of the month, a lot of people. don't show up because they just figure, they have the rest of the month, to make it up, which has been it's common in like most programs that i've worked in. galleries and so people are like oh no shit i'll just miss it and then you know I still got 31 or 3030 days left of the month, the to squeeze one session and so it's common So the first past couple days pretty pretty easy pretty light for me so."
4222.0,Patient,Oh hasn't been cool.
724.0,Provider,"But then the payoff at the end of the month, is that i'm like i'm just swapped you know what I mean like they just. everybody's bottleneck in for like 30 minutes sessions, so they just over. Again, because they're trying to get them in it is what it is just work."
4222.0,Patient,"that's cool. it's cool you get to work from home, though, imagine 100% of the time right."
724.0,Provider,"yeah it's definitely a convenient save on gas save on you know my inner office drama I don't necessarily have to like report to an HR REP or anything I don't have to deal with like office drama now, which is nice to get like in this field is typically office drama like anything else."
4222.0,Patient,yeah yeah exactly.
724.0,Provider,I don't have to deal with any of that. Contact my supervisor when I needs stuff and that's really about it.
4222.0,Patient,"For us, is something that I can do without."
724.0,Provider,"A lot of trouble, where you're at."
4222.0,Patient,"i'm. not really until. damn man is the craziest thing would happen to me earlier on today was the. Things have been going on at work lately like I say everything has been normal and. What it happened, I just found out today that are new form and or who's going to be our new form and happens to be someone that works with us or me sorry works there on another ship. Because our last form and he left about a month ago, and our backup foreman has been filling in. And I just found out today that are new soon to be forming happens to be do it on another ship that I just don't get along didn't get along with it all and for lack of better word that those just a straight up dig and. he's about to get promoted right he's getting promoted to this position to be the form to be a foreman on our ship now I just found out about it today. At the end of this right before I got off so now, I guess, he starts next week and it's like dude this is going to suck I really got into it with him a few years ago, when I first started and I hadn't really ever talked to him since but uh. Anyway, like I say we'll see how it goes i'm guy guy I have. My concerns about the way that how that's going to end up turning out based on the way this guy is in there i'm not the golden one, there are other people that have had problems with him to in the past."
724.0,Provider,Well what's the what's the consensus there's gotta be some kind of like i'm. Shifting communication from the shift that he's currently add to your to your server must be some kind of like basic understanding of like what he's about or what he's been up to the like the past few months as he's still somewhat of a hassle or is the gods.
4222.0,Patient,"dinner that's a good point I don't know I don't know i'm at home i'm hoping that he's gotten better because, like I say it has been years but. we'll find out man, but like I say I honestly don't know what to expect. and"
724.0,Provider,How much interactions do you have what you're forming on any given day.
4222.0,Patient,"And a lot, or is it thing generally it doesn't really matter that much or i'm sorry generally not very much because it might take the position, however, the foreman has the ability to put you into a position where you do have a cm all the time it's just like. The position that i'm in basically isn't locked in stone and just had it just happens to me rock that one of it just happens to be the. position that i've been in for some time now to two and a half years, what I do. and basically the format is just respected that and that's just where i've been that's what I do. My particular department, but. He has the ability to change that all around so chooses. Which case that'd be like a something that really pissed me off we'll see how that goes i'm assuming he probably i'm assuming he would respect that, just like all the rest of them do like you know, this is what i've been doing for some time, so just keep the ball rolling. At the same point. I know I know other people I know other people that know him that have really gotten into it with him as well, like some guys that I was talking to you that i've worked with earlier on it, and he told me about it. And he just like one of my one of my buddies just like yeah well i'm screwed I got into it with him about a year and a half ago. Over something you know I got into an argument with him about a year and a half ago. And he said he's just concerned about the way things are going to end up turning out based on that so. we'll see what happens man like I say I don't know how I don't know anything for certain. Hopefully he'll be there'll be a decent we'll find out. What I want to see if he's not he could end up getting in trouble, too, yes."
724.0,Provider,"But like one or two things are going to happen, like they typically do right either he's going to come in and try not to rock the boat too much, because if the if the shift has been running smoothly, with a interim supervisor. Then it's probably not going to try to deviate. Too much that'd be pretty dumb right, you know what I mean why right. To make your life more complicated more difficult. Second, would be like, why would you willingly take a position with a shift that you've had dust stops where people on it, you know what I mean so maybe he's coming in with the perspective, where he's gonna. You might take advantage of the shift being you know easy manageable or he's gonna come over and try to be a super depth and then get people can and then return that's going to make his life even more complicated so to me."
4222.0,Patient,"It would it absolutely would because, like I say we work with the Union and the Union is actually pretty strong and a lot of respects."
724.0,Provider,"Right, so he is like I say if there's a lot of people on the ship that don't like him."
4222.0,Patient,"Including the backup form and who I know for fact doesn't like him she's the interim for me that was doing this for the last month, she the reason that she doesn't take the position is because she's not allowed to work as much overtime. As a result, she decides to be the backup foreman where she can still be a member of the Union. and take advantage of over time, as opposed to being part of management technically she's actually got a ton of pole with management and she doesn't like him either so basically long story short, you have."
724.0,Provider,A hornet's nest. Will yeah so it's.
4222.0,Patient,"kind of ironic, he is walking into on it, to an extent. we'll see how it goes for like I say she she. She. yeah he if he's. I we got a feeling that she's going to try to problem she's gonna probably try to get rid of them too, so she's actually has the power to do that that's the irony of it is she's a position lower than him and yet she has the power to get rid of them since. she's been working there for so long."
724.0,Provider,"what's good I mean like the perspective to have you know what I mean like it's like anything at this point like like you need the job. And if he's gonna come in and try to be a lot, you know and be like be like look man I I come here to work i'm too old to be dealing with trauma and bullshit. Right like I come here, I punch the clock I keep to myself, I do, I have to do."
4222.0,Patient,You know.
724.0,Provider,"And then I leave you know, and I tend to leave the job when I clock out so be like I don't want this to be any more complicated than it has to be so don't make it any coffee and that has to be like."
4222.0,Patient,Saying like basically the way that that I should approach him in the event that they're.
724.0,Provider,"yeah if there isn't just be like look whatever whatever history you guys may or may not have be like I put that shit in the past, a long time ago I just come into work."
4222.0,Patient,"You know I mean right right right Thank you man, and I do. And you know i'm. Sorry, like I say, generally speaking, I got a pretty good. I got a pretty good reputation around work with management whatnot they know that I work really hard I don't call in i'm generally they know that i'm a really decent employee and they kill end up learning that as well, once he gets on on to the shift so. Like I say for now i'll give him the benefit of the doubt. Who knows how I learned back then, like you were saying those two possible potential scenarios it's going to be one of those obviously."
724.0,Provider,"And both of them make his life more difficult, so I can't imagine that. You know somebody would willingly do that to complicate matters for themselves it's like you do realize if you ostracize like your crew they're not going to perform. You know, to a certain degree that you're going to need them to and then manager is going to look at you and figure out why your people aren't listening it's, just like the service, you know, like. Right having the rank doesn't make you a good leader and shit like that, and those people get weeded out fairly quickly and it's like you're just. you're good at testing but you're horrible at leading you know what I mean right spread that out, you know if morale is down in production is down then that's all they really give a shit about production. Then it'd be like where's what's what's the outlier and it's like well. right here this guy couldn't leave out of the playhouse it mcdonald's man, you know what I mean it's like I don't like. you'll have that benefit."
4222.0,Patient,"It is worrisome, though, because this dude's got an ego and he's a straight up like I say man if he's anything like the way he was three years ago, he was really the only person. On my shift at that point in time, that I had a problem with on the entire ship, but this was literally right after I started working there so."
724.0,Provider,And what was his what's his deal like what what makes it difficult.
4222.0,Patient,"When I first started working there about three years ago, I was going through training or i'm sorry I really wasn't training actually I was doing I was on a particular position. It wasn't very difficult I just didn't know much I hadn't received any real formal training, because they had me on a special assignment doing something else for about the first month, so I get out there. Once I was done with that assignment over the first month start doing this particular position and he was on it, as well as another employee that was doing this position as well, and he would just like do these negative condescending. asked me these negative condescending questions like who trained, you know you're not supposed to do with this boy you're supposed to do with that, but you know just be an addict for for no good reason. and I got into it with them over time I Scott pissed off, so I just started, you know I can't remember exactly what it was that I ended up saying to him. But I just told him, you know shut the hell up basically mind your own. Over time, and it ended up going to management me and him had to go meet with the then for foreman who he's now getting the position of. Just sort things out, you know we did technical you know we did formerly anyway, and we didn't have any issue after that and I haven't even spoken to him since. But I cross paths as a few times and we never said words to each other, but there's these definitely remembers it there's no doubt about that. So. Anyway, like I say i'm not tripping off of it that much anyway, if he ends up if he ends up being an issue with the ends up being a problem then i'll adjust accordingly."
724.0,Provider,yeah I mean that's. yeah i'm sure you you've dealt with should heads before. You just have to. tolerate people that you work with you don't have to be their friend you just have to tolerate them.
4222.0,Patient,"exactly when you need it for whatever reason he wants to be a straight up dig and like imposes will, however, it may be in a negative way. I mean i'm not going to put up with that i'm all for it, you know go to the Union, or whatever the case may be, you know i'm not that concerned about it."
724.0,Provider,"yeah you have your tools it's just just the idea of is disruptive you know and it creates you know stress and. Anger through and yourself, you know because I was like. going to work was predictable you'd be like I know what to expect and now now there's this ambiguous about. I don't know what to expect going into tomorrow, whenever he starts it's like and we have like this negative history attached to it so it's yeah it's stressful you know what I mean like."
4222.0,Patient,"You could not have described it any better bonuses man, you could not have describe it any better than you just did. yeah you know."
724.0,Provider,"Like you said you'll just have to play by ear and adjust accordingly and. try not to put too much. Too much emphasis on it that you already have you know I mean like a lot of cell is going to happen, naturally, even if you don't want it to so just try not to. feed into it too much like well we'll see maybe changes way be like that the complete optimist be like Oh, maybe he's a good guy now who knows what."
4222.0,Patient,Oh yeah that's true man will see the way we'll see how he is. i'm sure he's not he can't come in beta complete dig good because he's. going to piss too many people off it's not going to fly. Good.
724.0,Provider,job and title and.
4222.0,Patient,"I mean our backup form and doesn't even like in my gag we've been told she's pissed off that it's happening she's twice his age students like. I can't even remember how old he is I think he's like 28 years old, or something like that which isn't. it's not that you know it's too young, though I don't understand why they're hiring these positions anyway it's not even worth the time or he didn't like the this department has that much power anyway, they really don't. You really been. Compared to all the management positions that are above them with your tongue so yeah man I don't plan on working there forever anyway, though, like I say you were telling me about that vocational rehab I ended up checking it out a little bit getting onto the website and whatnot. I need to put a lot more effort into it, though."
724.0,Provider,um.
4222.0,Patient,yeah.
724.0,Provider,"Did you did you talk to because, because one of the other moves is that if you call like your local vfw they have there's a title forum there's. Some. they're like a REP so like if you call the VF like your local vfw. Right right tell them that you're trying to get into the folk rehab they have a person that they'll put you in contact with, and they have like their own. Like veteran title or some something like that it's like this, like a Union almost like like I was quite surprised to like learn all this stuff. fairly recently. So that would be like the next step if you're running into like. What happened."
4222.0,Patient,Nothing nothing i'm here or was.
724.0,Provider,"yeah so. That could be like your next move be like hey. i'm looking into like book rehab navigating some of the information is a little complicated right now I don't really have a whole lot of time, I think, somebody to explain to me that's. See speaks my language, a little bit more than what the websites telling me don't have a person of that they they'll put you in contact a local guy like somebody like within your community."
4222.0,Patient,"Right right that's the vfw is all about, and also."
724.0,Provider,"urea a G walk veteran and you're looking to get into VOC rehab to maybe change your career path educational paths or something like that, and then they'll put you in contact so that would be your next move."
4222.0,Patient,"So great and, believe me. I should have been on it more I should have been on it more by now like I say i've been dragging my feet this last month because i've been somewhat more content with my job than I had been in the months prior i've actually been somewhat more content with that, as of late. But nothing that goes inside."
724.0,Provider,"This new caveat so now, you might notice."
4222.0,Patient,"That but also i'm I mean that's that's secondary to the. reality that I want to move on, anyway, regardless just because I hate the schedule. You know, in part. i'm going to be getting into that I really should start, I really should start tomorrow actually I got the next couple of days off so. There was something else I was meaning to ask you actually I can't remember exactly what it is, I can't remember should have written it down. yeah nothing to other than that nothing too exciting going on for me right now just work and. What else, is there not a whole hell of a lot. Did you catch the JET did you catch the SOx game last night."
724.0,Provider,"I saw the highlights on Twitter, because I work until like midnight or 1230 most nights I don't really get a chance."
4222.0,Patient,"to sit you go over right it's midnight over there, right now, isn't it."
724.0,Provider,"Almost it's 1130. I mean, I say a bit till like two or three o'clock in the morning anyways i'm somewhat of a night owl but."
4222.0,Patient,yeah.
724.0,Provider,"I do, the bulk of my work really like the last will half a half my shift is really spent on like the bottom half so like I miss out on like you know from. gotcha six to midnight i'm not watching any TV i'm normally spending time with the kids for from like five to about seven know doing like dinner and shut down and then and then i'm straight into work for the rest of the night."
4222.0,Patient,"I go to a. nightlife see you see people in the west coast, then. Later hours. I go, is it primarily from California, is it all split up on the west coast."
724.0,Provider,"it's primarily California and then lately i've been getting like some more like Ohio patients, which is there on East coast, but I see them earlier in the day."
4222.0,Patient,"So do you whip solely with bright or. yep okay Okay, so of course you do, then yeah you I gotcha I know that they have a lot it's bizarre I like the folks that I see on my. In our meetings on our group meetings are from California and Tennessee."
724.0,Provider,All the kind of see really.
4222.0,Patient,"yeah yeah and I guess it's based on our particular doctor I guess. Those are the two states that she's license to. prescribe to prescribe medications two of the three or something like that, so this is weird man like happy from California and the other half are from. You know from Tennessee and it's just so odd that you can literally not only. Tell the accent differences there's literally that seems to be a difference in personality to or. yeah yeah yeah like a folks from Tennessee seem to be so much more. I don't want to say emotional, but just more willing to share I suppose I guess you could say and more. More camaraderie I don't know about can broader and i'm half asleep right now."
724.0,Provider,yeah yeah but yeah I know you're saying that they're more they're more.
4222.0,Patient,"Like more vocal. Oh, I see i'm talking to you and watching this there's a one i'm a huge San Francisco giants fan. um I just have to watch this game right right now, because it's the dodgers and the cardinals and it's a one game playoff. The winner of this game is going to move on to play bass, the giants so on in two days, and if the dodgers have 106 games, this year, and if they lose this game tonight it's all for naught so. Really, easy to watch multitask just. record will be here."
724.0,Provider,"Are you based out of California, is that your deal."
4222.0,Patient,yeah yeah i'm in i'm in.
724.0,Provider,i'm looking at vfw service officers right now.
4222.0,Patient,Okay cool.
724.0,Provider,"i'm old, I too am multitasking. So what what city, are you in that's closest."
4222.0,Patient,"I vfw in the modesto Stockton area is what you want it would want to look at I don't think there's a vfw branch in mantega, which is the city that i'm in."
724.0,Provider,San Diego is obviously too far away so again oakland and La.
4222.0,Patient,Okay. oakland would be the closest to me i'm about an hour east of oakland.
724.0,Provider,"Okay, do you got a pen and paper."
4222.0,Patient,yeah I can write it down on my application or no. Okay.
724.0,Provider,"Now this person is a vfw service officer. Whether or not she's going to be able to help you specifically with this if i'm not sure, but they tend to have a lot of overlap so she'll probably points in your direction if need be, she might be need she might not be and if she's not she'll probably point you in the right direction. Okay her name is tiffany Hubert H E be E RT."
4222.0,Patient,tiffany's the second sorry. tiffany. Peter Herbert Hoover.
724.0,Provider,H E ve RT. And she's a claims consultant.
4222.0,Patient,Okay.

4222.0,Patient,North. gotcha.
724.0,Provider,that's an oakland California.
4222.0,Patient,that's 1301 clay street. yep gotcha.
724.0,Provider,"So it would probably be somebody that would reach out to it just. ask about the process of getting into the to the folk rehab or whatever it's called. might need to contact what the steps are just learned, now that you're having some difficulty with the online process. Okay, clarify."
4222.0,Patient,"Like I said. I didn't spend nearly enough time on it in all honesty I I read the side a little bit, and then I started reading some posts from people online that we're talking about some of this. This is about a week ago and I hadn't done anything Prior to that, like I said I hadn't spoken to you in about a month I think it's been so I should have put a lot. I know that i'm going to be using using the resource, especially based on told me some of the stuff that they offer like there's no way that I should not like literally. do everything that I can utilize this based on my disability status and vets veteran status, I there's no doubt they would be able to help me find a job, the government, no doubt. Yes."
724.0,Provider,yeah my brother he just he just scored a job with the GA.
4222.0,Patient,of us are living selling me.
724.0,Provider,He just started in the beginning of October so.
4222.0,Patient,He said he does for them.
724.0,Provider,"He does on healthcare analytics so he's like really anything works from home now like four days a week, and he goes to the office once a week. And it's like i'm just processing information and then running it through like a software and then like the software program does all like the real work."
4222.0,Patient,"You know what I mean Oh, I see okay so."
724.0,Provider,"i'm really it's probably just doing like you know healthcare administration and tracking you know finance, just like oh probably like a lot of lot of stuff that I would get bored with."
4222.0,Patient,"Okay right, of course."
724.0,Provider,"But he's in the va now so. Now that he's in the system at the GS level, you know he could do a year and then go anywhere unilaterally his security clearance is going to get bumped up he's going to get like a lot of like a lot of shit granted like like the pay is slightly under what he expects. But that's how the government started so bill slightly under pay you. And then the next year it's like a 10 grand raise and the year after that it's like a $10. And then you go from like GS seven to nine to 12 to 15 and then you're thinking Max out of whatever it is, but then you're making like like crazy money so incrementally every time you go up in grade it's just way more money. Wait what he said, or a friend of my girlfriends she's at the GS level she got in and, like the first year they apparently like. 35 K. And it's like that's that's not really good money but. Rather, every every year since then she's only been there for two years she's making like $75,000 now. Okay."
4222.0,Patient,But it's just like.
724.0,Provider,Like through the roof. or my brother. yeah he's like i'll sit here i'll buy my time and then like a year i'll put in for like a lateral transfer like Florida and i'll make. A whole bunch more money and my dollar goes a lot further and floor than it does in New England and he was like and i'm good man like. don't count his service time towards a retirement or a pension or something like that so he's going to do X amount less of what you would typically need so.
4222.0,Patient,"yeah man, I have told."
724.0,Provider,Everybody we all want to get in.
4222.0,Patient,"Right yeah man, this is my This is something that I should be. Absolutely 100% take advantage of I totally have i've been thinking about it more than acting. Knowing that it's something that i'm going to do, but now i'm freaking i'm gonna i'm gonna get the ball rolling man. Good need to too old i'm too i'm too old to. be able to afford not to."
724.0,Provider,"yeah you know me so take advantage of the resources that are there, a lot of times like they don't tell us you know what what our options are we have to like discover them. unfortunate thing, but once you're in like you're in. So cool that's."
4222.0,Patient,right on.
724.0,Provider,that's the goal right.
4222.0,Patient,"All right, bro."
