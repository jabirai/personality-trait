15172.0,Patient,Because I made them more difficult.
298.0,Provider,So um how are your meds working for you.
15172.0,Patient,"I feel like they're doing pretty good don't want to have this one i'd sleeping at night, so I still wake up, like every two hours i've been taking that I didn't take the ambien every night, but I think I took it last night, I still kept waking up."
298.0,Provider,"Okay, and you know waking up. It that is the hardest thing in a medication to get somebody to go to sleep all night long. Your happen reports out there, that a gap of penton keeps people asleep i'm gabapentin is less habit for me then ambien. yeah not as strong as ambien by any means. But it is almost not as addicting and you don't build this tolerance, the way you do to ambien. um you can definitely do some research and think about it."
15172.0,Patient,it'll go down. Your your boss your mind.
298.0,Provider,"Okay, well then, my my recommendation is, let me give you some pills, to see if it keeps you asleep okay. yeah and it's called gabba penton. and see if you can replace the ambien with this. Okay, you could take them together it's not going to hurt you that way, the purpose of gabba penton. is to keep you asleep, whereas ambien."
15172.0,Patient,Okay we'll give her a fire fire fire House all day.
298.0,Provider,"Right and we're hoping that, as you get further out from your hospitalization. That you need less medications. So that you need less ambien. um. And how much ambien did you say you had left."
