418.0,Provider,"mm hmm. So a lot of times. it's a lot of times there's something about what's going on with you, amber it sounds to me like. there's a part of US that's not done, do you think that could be it. Like that do you. Is there ever a thought in your mind that you could use successfully. Like you sometimes and be. Okay, no okay. So hi."
11860.0,Patient,"Have you ever had my. way I thought that I gave. You my favorite quotes that I took from there and I took it with me, I am probably more times you know and but one is the meaning of housing is never enough. And so that I can my sister she's an addict so my mom she's a recovering addict like my sister just got her 12 steps to cricket."
418.0,Provider,mm hmm.
11860.0,Patient,hey that that's my that's my favorite line plenty naming 1000 if ever enough because it's so true.
418.0,Provider,"So, so your family has the addiction does your husband's family as well."
11860.0,Patient,"know. His mom's knows motivate and lead when she was younger, but I think it was nice with coke or something she had a bad reaction to it. Then his dad the same way. There when Derek recurring up a teenage boy, if not, we have a finance pipe stuff in his bedroom his mom was click the time now, you see when they when they don't play."
418.0,Provider,Right right right. wow so. And you started using at what age.
11860.0,Patient,"When I was like 1516 I ran away from home and then I after my mom was like I am not going to change, you know more we're in order to call CPS on herself. After to check on them call them to come find me and they're like look there's obviously some reason she doesn't want to be there, you know. When he's like i'm behind that is not my authority to come in your House and see why he's a rather does that or go she's 16. After she was Okay, with it, like i'd come in go and geezer be filled up a cup halfway up with water or Pepsi or whatever juice drink man and she put a pillow at it and then see to give us strength of it in that time and he said. Why."
418.0,Provider,Why would she give it to you.
11860.0,Patient,I never understood that.
418.0,Provider,Was it to pitch it asleep was a like how old were you.
11860.0,Patient,"I show for like 16. They started with my oldest sister first year I guess. I want to know what the big deal is you know it wasn't what's it what's up with the red solo Cup. But she did when we were younger she she would give us benadryl and nightclothes can make as good as. I got older one of her friends, for me, I didn't even know she had me she did they said that she kept clicking bottles up their their room and more likely to the bottles to and then. They were like even you know, even if you didn't know. Now I can't even seeing this now i'm like well i've been adult I cannot me bless me."
418.0,Provider,Okay. So.
11860.0,Patient,"we're doing, I felt like. I was. Like it was like any natural for me not being an addict you know because i've added my mom my dad alcoholics on my dad side."
418.0,Provider,So let me ask.
11860.0,Patient,You growing up.
418.0,Provider,"What do you want, for your children."
11860.0,Patient,I want to break the cycle.
418.0,Provider,What did what did what was it make you feel like if one of them started using.
11860.0,Patient,That would be a bad day. Right like I don't think i've ever clicked on my phone.
418.0,Provider,"Okay, so so you don't want that for them so so the thing using is not an option."
11860.0,Patient,So what we have to do is.
418.0,Provider,"Find out you're going to the psychiatrist and that's good, but this is about your addiction in amber you have to find out. What it is. that's going to satisfy the voice, I have a husband who works, a lot he works, a lot, so he could take care of us because it's hard out there it's you know he's taking care of you right. So now, you have to be the creative one and it's hard for you, because you didn't come from a healthy family so now you're trying to make all these healthy family choices when, where do you pull from right."
11860.0,Patient,yeah.
418.0,Provider,"So you need to possibly consider. Checking out some women's groups. Either online in your Community um get with some other women. Go for. You know, during okay. yeah or you know they find you know women's groups in churches you got the you know the meetings over who supports and then all online they have all kinds of different groups. It doesn't necessarily have to be for you know, an A or a, but it could be anything with a lot of women who are healthy and not drinking and drugging but trying to figure out life, just like you, you know what I mean and. And there's a lot of that out there and then you know what happened to your children while you and your husband were using."
11860.0,Patient,"What must like that. When I thought that I always thought like I never did anything i'm planning my face, you know, like. If they're buying clothes or not and i'm like i'm good mom and then, when I got in trouble my counselor she was like no you're not none like it. You know that took a knife to the heart, you know she was like you might not have been might not a huge improvement in English, she was like that you were high around name and. He was right, you know, like I didn't want to admit it, it was he told me, I was at that moment, I heard because her out but I had to step back and take you know my job and I thought at the time she was like really sit and think about it, the inverse. is true."
418.0,Provider,"Think about this is if you're high then you're really not present. You if you're if you're using substances, then you're really not happy when they're happy Do you remember everything all those little things that moms remember about the kids and when they come home and. And all that thing, did you spend a lot of time sleeping and was everything you know what I mean so so you have to think about that a lot of times, people say, well, I don't have these are my kids my kids don't know anything. They know they they may not be able to put words to it like we can, but they know they know. Why, and so now that they've already been exposed to that. And these are young boys and you want them to always see you as mommy."
11860.0,Patient,You know what I mean you want.
418.0,Provider,to know that you know you're strong and you want them to have that kind of wife that strong and supportive and that that's what but they they're going to get what they see.
11860.0,Patient,"Most of the time right. So I was a child, growing up my mom was they're not home or. Like that mm."
418.0,Provider,So you want better.
11860.0,Patient,yeah yeah. And you can look at. My. teacher she asked a couple of the girls are like well I don't have a babysitter for my kid I can't do this because I got my kid and she was like you got hired I can make that game tonight any like showing them you guys rather than get clean and.
418.0,Provider,"Yes, yes, show them that it's hard work it's not easy. But you're doing it and you're doing it for yourself, so that you can be better for them. amber you have an advantage that a lot of women don't have you have all day long to yourself. you're stuck. you're stuck in the House and you're bored but find something that's your time that's your time that you can set up your meetings in the morning. You know, you can go to your your meetings can be morning meetings when the House is empty, you can you know go for healthy walks or. You know what I mean do something just for you have that coffee by yourself outside on the porch or whatever. and set up your meeting and say you know what i'm going to do my bright heart me meetings in the morning, so I don't have any distractions and you can do more than one a week, you know take that time to what can I do for just me since I have this time, what can I do for just to me."
11860.0,Patient,"This week, I had an idea that my kids they had would invoke a state and then. they're boys now I had that down and I had to buy them like a metal frame that's alertness and what that was laying down their mother Google and see what I can make out of."
418.0,Provider,"The well my gosh. we've done it my friend and I, we got I have a few in my house their their pictures made of offense and old fence she replaced your fence. Oh yeah go on there on pinterest and do that see a ti why you know."
11860.0,Patient,Why. So that's a good idea. i'm always.
418.0,Provider,"In the funny thing is, you know we say our doctor sometimes medicine is just not going to cut it medicines, not the answer. yeah. So I that's my biggest thing and like I said, make your meetings for bright heart in the morning, so that you don't have to."
11860.0,Patient,"Well, I think you don't have morning appointment."
418.0,Provider,"I. My my appointments are not are not in the morning, but I mean like your groups."
11860.0,Patient,"yeah I see, I think I think Julie, the earliest, like me and which is like 130 but i'm still by myself, you know. So that's. That that was perfect because three o'clock my oldest went to junior high here, so I have to pick him up from football or mean down the road to get back to activity been done. Like I used to do three o'clock one and then she was right, and then I was working at Texas roadhouse and they open at three so i'd be at work at three so I went to 131 and I like yeah very, very good. I guess. I wish the group was more active in talking."
418.0,Provider,Right.
11860.0,Patient,"Right it's a time I get on there and auditors are talking, and I feel like i'm talking too much and they I know there's anything with timing groups or a doctor or hospital cut locker room I."
418.0,Provider,"Know that's Good though you just talk and they don't want to utilize their group, then you utilize it for yourself get as much as you can get out of that group that's your time to talk and get through. It because you know that's how you're going to get stronger, I see a person who's struggling right now, like you're still in that being you, you want to get stronger. And more confident and being you want to get to the place where you know what using is not even an option it's so far beyond you know behind you that. that's not an option, you know what I mean I don't care if i'm overwhelmed or if I am sad or I got bad news i'm having a bad day that's not an option."
11860.0,Patient,"I got five other options, but."
418.0,Provider,"that's not one of them, you know. And that's where you want to get to. Because right now it's like that's right before you soon as something happens here we go. If you that. You know you want that to not be an option."
11860.0,Patient,That makes sense. wow.
418.0,Provider,"Okay, so. i'm glad that you showed up today see your appointment."
11860.0,Patient,"was at the fourth I think better with you, I pulled in. Is I take my my son had a meeting at school, and I think. I thought last year to get in a secular education reading teachers and the school check that we didn't have one. But I take an actor and he says that she's like that's illegal, they have to have one, so I thought, with him, and then everyone got six and human foods, the foods this year. And then her teacher, one of the meetings where we can figure out like how we're going to get them caught up in the I felt so bad because I had to miss group, yes, I was on their planning schedule, you know."
418.0,Provider,Right ready.
11860.0,Patient,"But when they came in, I told her I said. I said I wouldn't call you right back and it takes me 20 minutes, maybe half hour I said, my drugs drinking and now i'm going to call back and do that and. I asked her I said, I think I have an appointment with cheryl I said I noticed the beginning of October, and she told me they can be deceiving in my church. So, then, I asked again when they saw me do my screen and she's like Oh, you had it with her an hour ago and i'm like I didn't ask the last person, you know. So when I went that route, he doing Julie was like every have to do that and, like I know they told me and they told me, I was wrong, and then I didn't have a."
418.0,Provider,"Good well you get them write them down or something like that and. You know when it's coming on the second one just you know make another one ahead of time that's all okay. All right, you okay."
