726.0,Provider,guys. haha your last two weeks since our last meeting.
13565.0,Patient,"Better. i've been getting less angry. and i've been just doing like little like tasks like. To keep my. Like my mind busy. Because if I don't like I tend to. Think about things, and then overthink and so. I just don't want to do that anymore, and so I mean i'm in doing better. The only thing I have moments where like I don't feel good, but then, like, I have to think like I can change it by. By just. redirecting my energy, you know, like my attention. And that's. that's kind of hard for me to do because. I tend to analyze things and I know it's not good, because. it's stressful it can be stressful sometimes yeah. But. i'm good."
726.0,Provider,thanks again tell me a little bit about on when you said you don't feel good can you describe the feelings that are coming off.
13565.0,Patient,"play. Any call it. Like not feeling secure about myself. Like the way look or like the way. you're not very social like I choose to be alone, most of the time. Because I don't know I just. i'm. Like instead of going with the flow like when i'm around people I tend to. not go with the flow, you know I do the opposite."
726.0,Provider,So explain that. explain that to me know what is that.
13565.0,Patient,i'm. They get work or. Its work and family were. I used to go to family gatherings but then I stopped because I just didn't feel confidence with mice within myself. And so. that's one of the reason why I isolate myself. um. So.
726.0,Provider,What are the thoughts that are coming up for you when you're with your family they feel not confident like what is it the feeling.
13565.0,Patient,I guess like talking about others or comparing. With others that makes me feel a little uncomfortable or it does affect me. But yeah.
726.0,Provider,Is that the conversation you're having in your mind or is that what's happening out like around you.
13565.0,Patient,around me. What is happening around me.
726.0,Provider,"Are they are they doing like the people that you're with are they making comparisons. about you, or is it that it's like it's a conversation you're having in your in your head."
13565.0,Patient,Okay yeah it's mostly a conversation I have in my head. I do tend to make a lot of assumptions. So I just. I just forget that I do that it's like a bad habit yeah.
726.0,Provider,yeah So what is it that you're thinking about what are the comparisons that you. Have that you're making in your mind and then with your family.
13565.0,Patient,"um. Like I haven't seen them. Like I haven't talked to them, maybe it's been like two weeks. So. i've been feeling like a little detach from like everything and everyone. So. That feeling of. them assume or me, assuming that they are. That they are upset with me for acting a certain way with them that makes sense."
726.0,Provider,"yeah makes sense, you."
13565.0,Patient,"they've been. At the time I kind of lost my temper and so. So it can it kind of ended, just like they're like they're I haven't like communicated or I haven't apologized and i've been wanting to but. I just I don't I don't i'm. i'm not ready to that make sense. Like a."
726.0,Provider,So what happened that you got mad what's happening.
13565.0,Patient,"um. I was just a little stressed, though. About like how I was gonna pay my bills, you know because I haven't been working i've been on disability leave. Like I was just kind of a little stressed out over that because I was behind, but then I applied for disability and and I was able to figure it out, but, at the time, like I just. When I was communicating with my brother, because he was helping me with the paperwork so."
726.0,Provider,"christy, can I ask what you were on disability for."
13565.0,Patient,"um. I Paddy um. I didn't know how to explain it, but I. It has to do, do you remember when you send me the content, the the about ED Mr I think."
726.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
13565.0,Patient,"So, like I kind of had that experience at work. Where. I don't know I can't I don't I don't want to confuse you so i'm trying to choose, like the words i'm in stay focus on one thing. i'm."
726.0,Provider,"A notebook. yeah. Alright, so just why don't you just I mean I know you're holding. The phone too, but. yeah my question is, what are you wanted to build it for."
13565.0,Patient,"Okay um. I kind of lost my temper. And then. I. So I yeah I kind of lost my temper and and. yeah I don't know um. It had to do with. The I thought. Like I got triggered because. I have. moments when like i'm listening. To someone and I like assume that they're talking about me like in a negative way. So, like. It was kind of those were like I made a comfort to a confrontation regarding that and. And it got to the point where. My coworker like had spoken with my supervisor regarding that, like my attitude my. yeah i'm. So i'm so."
726.0,Provider,So fulfill Dyer people work for disability. Within a doctor because i'm sure Dr had to put something in writing for you so for that.
13565.0,Patient,"Yet, yes, it was. She sent a form to my I don't know yeah it was through doctor."
726.0,Provider,What are your primary care doctor or was it their high trust.
13565.0,Patient,It was my physician. My dog yeah.
726.0,Provider,So. Could you find out what what was put on the people were.
13565.0,Patient,"I read it, and it says a severe depression."
726.0,Provider,Okay.
13565.0,Patient,"um. And my. I think the reason why, like I tend to lose my temper is because. it's either I don't understand something or it's because. i'm overwhelmed. More if if someone says something I take it personally also. yeah."
726.0,Provider,"Okay okay. This week hasn't been more hasn't been more triggering than than before. In comparison, like if you compare the last two weeks. Long how has this week, been for you. With your anger like let's say your temper and let's say we're not scale it from like zero to 10 like when you were with your family last get together. And being explosive. and throwing things or hurting somebody 10 is a kid somebody and so Where would you have scaled yourself in your anger."
13565.0,Patient,This past two weeks.
726.0,Provider,"or actually i'll say i'll be more specific, that event that you just had with your family where you had a temper let's say outburst. How at a scale of zero to 10 on anger and 10 being kidding somebody Where would you have put yourself."
13565.0,Patient,"would say is 668 got I felt better this week um. I also felt like I I. haven't been as patient, as I should be with like. With my medication like I want it like I wanted to. feel like better like right away. But, but I know like it's not that's not how it works. And so that also works with. Like my therapy like what were you and I talked about. Like I tend to want to like do things. Like fast or. Or, like, I want to do a lot, but I mean sometimes I just can't because. I don't know, for whatever reason yeah. yeah yeah. Oh."
726.0,Provider,"Oh city. So you talked about feeling overwhelmed does that happen too often like even if you weren't in in this session with me if you're talking with anybody or you're doing something, are you how often are you feeling overwhelmed."
13565.0,Patient,"lately. it's it's it's been a little less because, like since I haven't been working like I have been able to. Like have time to reflect on like you know my thoughts or um. So. um. Oh."
726.0,Provider,"Okay it's Okay, no i'm sure yeah yeah. One thing at a time it's okay."
13565.0,Patient,"Thank. I think the reason why I started. feeling or acting with temper is because I had i'm having or. I had trouble. Getting over a like it wasn't a breakup because I was never with her, but I had trouble accepting that it was never going to work or it's never gonna work. So I feel like the reason that this whole i'm. Like it I think it's rooted from that because. i've been trying to destroy or subconsciously I i've been trying to distract myself and work, you know, with nothing. Without. Without healing those like resume resentments you know."
726.0,Provider,"But you. Remember, you You also told me that you know you were having these issues at home and it sounds like everything happening, even before this happened at work."
13565.0,Patient,yeah and.
726.0,Provider,"So it may be, it may feel that it makes it seem like it's just that, but it sounds like it's a lot deeper than that. If it's been happening you've been isolating yourself from your family, to the point where you were sleeping in your car, so I mean there has to be more to it than just that you know what I mean."
13565.0,Patient,"i'm. it's just that feeling of being like feeling secure like feeling. Like comfortable around them. Like there's moments like there's moments, where I feel like when I have a conversation with them like it's hard for me to. Leave the conversation when they need to. Like I tend to like. what's the word I don't know um. Like like instead of. I know we talked about this, the other day, when you said, like putting boundaries on like. On life my parents it's more is more my mom I don't know why. we're having trouble like when I, we have a conversation I tend to like. Deep like. go into it deeply and then. She gets into a deeply but not in a bad way it's more like I have like we just. I get drained and then it's hard for me to. Like to change the. Energy like then negative energy. And I don't know they got I want to say it's her, and you know me because it's so easy. to blame or it's so easy to. You know I mean like I don't. know so yeah."
726.0,Provider,"So. So I wanted to, I know you said that you can get overwhelmed I wanted to do something with you and I want. This practice is something that you can do for yourself anytime and if you you do it for yourself basically put on. If you think of all of the things you know how you said you get overwhelmed that feeling of them over on now Christine can you describe how it physically feels to feel overwhelmed for you."
13565.0,Patient,"Oh, my. Lady I can feel it like on my shoulders. Like my body tends to to tense up. And then. There are times, where like I am like panting like as if i'm like losing. my breath or something like that you know."
726.0,Provider,"Okay, so I want you to imagine that, so you know how we talked before about writing stuff down so that's just to help you with the funeral for a while Okay, so this exercise that I want you to do i'm going to guide you through it. And what I want you to do is think of all of the things that you're worried about so imagine that you're not in a big storage area and and and we give you 20 maybe 10 maybe five however many you feel like you need it could be bins they can be boxes, they could take a look like a chest. Just imagine that Okay, I want you to if you can write you could like just so you can get into it, you couldn't close your eyes or you could just lightly be down. But I want you to think of all of these things that are feeling overwhelming for you, so if you think about the last time that you were with your family imagine putting all these all these issues and different boxes. they're all different worries so i'm worried about it look i'm worried about what they think i'm worried about that somewhere imagine putting all of those in storage units, and so what you're what you're going to do is when you do that, you say to yourself. I don't i'm, not forgetting you i'm going to come back to you when i'm ready for them when i'm ready to come back to you i'm going to come back to you, so I can fix it or or find a solution to it, but for right now i'm going to put these in the bin. Because. All these different things that are happening, it sounds like you have a lot going on in your head so you're not like you're with people but you're here, most of the time. So, by putting these worries in little compartments you can get back to them when you are okay to do that. And it helps it just helps to put it on the side, so it doesn't become overwhelming because the thoughts are coming up, and it feels like you have to like react to them right away right we don't have to. So, think about that, so I just want you to create in your mind will a storage place would be for and what, what are the things that you're putting in the boxes so just go in and try try to do that yourself. Right now, just yeah. And then just. Just let me know i'm going to stay quiet i'm just going to guide you so create this place, for you have all these storage bins. are thinking about all the things you want to put in that bin. And you put them in your mind you put them in the bin each thing. And when you're ready just let me know and you can talk i'll stick Wyatt."
13565.0,Patient,Okay i'm ready.
726.0,Provider,"Okay, now, what did you see when did that."
13565.0,Patient,um. I noticed that. They do you want Germany to tell you what I put in each box or each been.
726.0,Provider,Whatever you want to tell me.
13565.0,Patient,"um. Because with me, I have trouble. Like I always had this trouble in school where. i'm taking a test and. Because of the time they I feel like there's always like there's always a timer right so that's how I felt right now like, even though I don't have a timer I felt like. I felt like I needed to put an item and each spin. So I just kind of. The first one was. It was. um. cuz i've been wanting to move out. Like I want to have I just it doesn't matter I don't really care if it's like an apartment or you know I mean, I just want to move out because. so that I can have a better relationship with my parents. Because I do really want to work on that. yeah so. um I feel like having my privacy and my space will help me. um so that was my first item. And the second one was. When i'm working with others like at work. I tend to. I tend to compete with others like not not wanting to you know I just do it like I when I find something or when I observe someone else. Like I tend to judge them or I tend to. yeah like overlook, some of you know, I mean. yeah so. Like I want to be able to do that because I mean that was one of the reasons why I couldn't work with my co workers like without having. To do that, because i'm. I think I was allowing I think envy to get in the way. i'm. And i'm. And you know they were all trying to help like the they were all trying to cooperate with me because I had a few warnings before my last our first you know. um so. I want to be able to work on. Like working with others and feeling confident about myself. Because I I feel like because I don't feel confident by myself, I tend to. i'm late, I tend to get like agitated and then I tend to. Like blame not blame it, but like I whoever's in my life whoever's in front of me like I tend to like somehow like. I don't know, maybe offend them or or like. any type of tension, you know um. So I want to work on like my my. The way I work with others, you know, like."
726.0,Provider,That is that what you put in the box.
13565.0,Patient,mm hmm. um. And then the third one. Is. feeling comfortable with my sexuality. I feel like that has a lot to do with like my level of competence. um and like I was like it's it's been improving like i've been accepting myself more lately. But. I still feel like insecure like I think that's another reason why don't go out like I don't socialize because my anxiety like just like I don't know.
726.0,Provider,It feels hard to accept yourself because of your family.
13565.0,Patient,"No, not anymore um I think it's just me like feeling comfortable with my so."
726.0,Provider,What is it what is it about yourself that you want comforter all about what is it that creates insecurity. be specific be as specific as possible.
13565.0,Patient,"Like i'm not used to being physical with someone like i'm very um. I don't want to say, like i'm not bragging about my. Like the way. Like my the way. Is in high school, I was more social, you know, like college I that's when I started to like not be social. So in high school like. I had, I had a group of friends, but it was never in a group, it was mostly like. We each had like an individual conversation like individual like deep conversation, you know so. um. So, because, like I have."
726.0,Provider,You muted yourself. yeah.
13565.0,Patient,Can you hear me sorry.
726.0,Provider,yeah no it's.
13565.0,Patient,"Okay, so. Big i'm not like like I said, like i'm not physically i'm not used to being physical. So. I I allow fear to get in the way you know, like afraid of I don't know like kissing someone or afraid of like talking to them like I used to in high school, but the only difference in high school like I. I wasn't dating you know, like I wasn't it was mostly just i'm. Having friends, you know. So when when."
726.0,Provider,Were you out in high school or was it a secret.
13565.0,Patient,I will. It was a secret yeah.
726.0,Provider,yeah.
13565.0,Patient,"So. I think it's just most in my body like the way I feel inside um. there's moments like I don't feel attractive. So that kind of. kind of affects the way I interact with others, you know. So. I think I think a lot of it also is like. That fear before something like once you're over there, like it wasn't as bad I don't know if that makes sense."
726.0,Provider,yeah no I get it yeah like after it happens it doesn't feel as bad as you thought it was something.
13565.0,Patient,"yeah so. I feel like that happens to me when. When like I. have the chance to be social to interact with someone like I. And then, once I start interacting with them like. It almost feels like a like I can't like I can't stop talking to you know I don't know."
726.0,Provider,it's weird yeah.
13565.0,Patient,I know that I think I tend to pull back like I tend to like.
726.0,Provider,"I think sometimes to the thing is like. The more you do it, the easier it becomes because the more you avoid it, the harder it is to go and do something it's like anxiety it's like. it's. like, if I were to avoid. let's say, for example. A car that's a Honda I don't know i'm just making it up if i'm avoiding those cars, all the time, you can have scared of those cars. Then it's constantly good i'm always going to be afraid of it because, even when it's not there i'm afraid that it's going to come up right so. I think one of the things that that can help is, you have to you have to override the instinct to isolate because the isolation is really what keeps you in the fear of of socializing with other people and it's the same thing. Like in relationship with other people right it's like oh this this was really uncomfortable and I don't want to do this anymore, but by not continuing or trying you get less good at something if you don't do it enough so it's like. i'm not saying like don't throw yourself into a party, full of random people, but what I would what I would try to do is even even with your family it doesn't feel comfortable right. there's a lot of stuff there. Try to limit your interaction, to try to meet with them or trying to say, if you come out of your room just say hi to your mom you don't have to have a full conversation, you could just feel like hi mom just wanted to wish you good morning, or something whatever. But just. Just shifting it because it's really easy to just lock yourself away just not talk to anybody ever you know."
13565.0,Patient,"yeah and it's it's true I do feel that way, like, I feel like right now. it's hard for me to go back into the. The flow, you know the. i'm like right now I feel like. like this connected."
726.0,Provider,yeah.
13565.0,Patient,I feel disconnected.
726.0,Provider,"The feeling disconnected feel safe to you, or does it feel good or does it feel bad to feel disconnected."
13565.0,Patient,"It feels. Like it just it feels. Like it's yeah it's it. It depends, it depends."
726.0,Provider,If you're lonely.
13565.0,Patient,"No, I don't know it's just I. I have trouble i'm seeking out. me yeah um but I don't feel alone it's just a. Like i'm fighting with that ego you know, to go out in. and You know, like. You know. yeah so."
726.0,Provider,"So, Christine for until and we're going to make an appointment for next time too, but what I want you to really think about his. feelings that you're having. About yourself okay i'm watching a journal something so that, when we meet next time you'll have something. More or you could even journal that day that we have an appointment together. So it's something that's fresh and new in your mind what I want you to. kind of write about for yourself. When you think about the insecurities and the thoughts that are coming up about that you that you're believing about yourself. Are they where are they coming from start really analyzing that is it coming, is it something that you heard when you were a kid is it something that that you. You took us truth Okay, I want you to start analyzing your beliefs about yourself that are coming up, then I want you to write them down because I want to hear what it is, I believe that about yourself that doesn't feel right. Okay. All right, so just start journaling your your thoughts, because you have a lot of them, and so, if you can look at your thoughts and you can write them down. Now we can think about is this a rational thought, or is this an irrational thought or a belief that I have that I just kind of believe I never really thought about I just leave it I just feel like it's true okay and question it, you know. So. What i'm gonna do i'm gonna look two weeks from today okay. Would you be available on. Well, could you too early or. Is that difficult it's Okay, if it is, I just want to know."
13565.0,Patient,If you want to do 7am or what time.
726.0,Provider,"Oh it's up to you, I mean because, are you an early bird or are you more. Time de."
13565.0,Patient,que we do in the afternoon like.
726.0,Provider,"yeah Of course not, not a problem I have here. tm your California so it's your time 2pm on October 19."
13565.0,Patient,Okay.
726.0,Provider,"Okay yeah. Okay. And just remember, I want you to write down the thoughts that you're having about yourself okay. I want you to really analyze where where the beliefs are coming from first I even want I don't even think you need to focus on on the beliefs, that are coming that you have, I want to just see what are the thoughts that pop up in your mind about yourself that you are believing okay. Right and like I said just try within the next two weeks right, you said that feeling disconnected doesn't feel good so when you get the impulse like when you get that feeling of wanting to isolate. And there's it but to isolate if something bad has happened, maybe, and you feel safer by isolating but, if things are okay, I want you to each day. Just just even for a limited time just say hi and just interrupt okay you don't have to go into a big conversation with anybody just try to interact with your environment. And, and the voice the conversation in your head. You tell it to stop just focus focus on your environment and where you're at, and I want you to pay attention to how you feel Okay, because I want to see what comes up for you."
13565.0,Patient,Okay.
726.0,Provider,"So I will see you in two weeks. Or would you um question know it's every two weeks, but would you want me every week."
13565.0,Patient,sure.
726.0,Provider,"Oh no not only if you want to please I don't want you to I don't want you to say yes, just because it's me I want you to actually think about it."
13565.0,Patient,"Okay. I think you want to help me like I don't mind, I think it would be good for me."
726.0,Provider,"So what i'll do is i'm gonna. let's keep it for the next two weeks, and then after that I want you to really think about it, and then in two weeks when we meet up i'll ask you. Okay okay. All right, you're welcome. bye. session."
