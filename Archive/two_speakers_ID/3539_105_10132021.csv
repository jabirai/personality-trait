3539.0,Patient,"hi can you hear me. Sorry, I completely I don't know what I was thinking this morning was Tuesday, so I like going like normal and then I lay down and the guy was up since five still doing my versions lunch, but. I almost forgot, and I just kind of sat down on the couch and I literally fell asleep and I woke up because my phone started vibrating and I think that was you just called you called right. Quick Brian and I. Like my phone vibrated and I jumped up, and I still I wasn't thinking in my head, that it was Wednesday, but I grabbed my phone and then i'm like. As soon as I saw your name I was like no way it's not when."
105.0,Provider,happens to everybody.
3539.0,Patient,i'm so sorry.
105.0,Provider,"let's make the most of over here. It does look like it's time the reviews on the 15th so that's this week, why don't we take a look at goals and see see where you're at with them, maybe we can close some opens new ones. And one of the first things we see here is decrease rushed feeling. How do you see that doing these days."
3539.0,Patient,"Every time we go over that one I always say to myself and my going to share this with you how we stay to myself, I think that's like a lifetime like a lifelong thing i'm gonna have. A hard, I can get. I can get. I think i'm doing well with it, I haven't really felt rushed lately. I. I guess i've just been feeling a lot of anxious because of my training and you know being anxious to get on the phones and all of that new stuff that i've been doing so. lot of just nervousness and anxious, I guess, for that, and maybe a little of excitement. But I haven't felt. rushed feelings in fact like even thinking about like five days back if I think about my days at work and even time at home. And thinking about let me think on the weekend. When i'm like doing chores and stuff I still don't feel like i've been doing that to myself at all."
105.0,Provider,So haven't.
3539.0,Patient,said I was like.
105.0,Provider,"Okay that's that's I wrote it down what we're looking for is to so you have an awareness of a decrease in rush feeling what we're looking for is an increase in mindfulness practices when they do show up and. Doing these practices, and you know, whatever those might be for you doing those around daily activities like preparing a lunch getting your daughter ready, whatever they are. That you do them at least three times a day so let's just look at that and there may not be a connection for you, but that's the way this particular goal was written it's you want to experience decrease rush feeling. And what I had said was let's have increase mindfulness practices throughout the day basically. So when you think about how you go about going into the kitchen or going into some room and you're going to do an activity and you start to get distracted by something else that comes to mind. Do you have that much awareness at this point, and then do you engage in anything to sort of bring you back into your body. But whether it's you know, a practice of the body or it's a practice of the mind where you're using cognitive skills are you doing them and about how many times a day, and what are you doing."
3539.0,Patient,"um yes definitely. For me it's always mostly going to be the self talk like I do a lot of that and I think that I do it multiple times throughout the day. More than three times. it's like and sometimes i'll even do it out loud like no Arielle that's a bad idea don't do that you know. you're going to forget to finish this and then you're going to like you know I I start know you're doing it again. finish this first don't start rushing around just stay here finish this focus on the one thing, so I would go back and think about we've talked about this in more than one. counseling session of ours, of course, but some of the times that we've talked about will stick out based on the things that you said. Think back to those times and some of the things and I think it really works when I do that, so I I actually I do that quite often."
105.0,Provider,"Okay, so thought stopping still very effective for you it's good okay just. Reviewing also that. It would be helpful, probably to get your body to also relax because if it keeps feeling anxious it's going to keep signaling that there's there's an urgency. So continue to engage in the breath work doing the belly breathing in those moments I know it seems strange but. i'm doing these exercises right then in the moment means you'll be able to complete that task you'll see okay everything's okay it's okay to just be present with doing one thing at a time and so and but getting the body to come on board with you. So just a. reminder to do that."
3539.0,Patient,"And I did about that breathing one because I when I first showed me that I was doing that one a lot and I feel like I forgot about it, but now you said it it's like you just reminded me and I feel like I want to do try to try to do that one again."
105.0,Provider,Okay.
3539.0,Patient,"was even hard for me to try to do it, and so it would I was focusing on that, so I don't know it was really nice to try to do that, so thank you."
105.0,Provider,Do you do you want me to refresh or if you've got the.
3539.0,Patient,"We can do it, I think yeah if you want really quickly, but I think I have it it's. You just you're making sure that your your stomach isn't like moving in and out you're staying."
105.0,Provider,isn't is not moving in and out.
3539.0,Patient,"Well, it is moving you now, but you're like chest isn't moving like I don't know I think i'm saying it wrong. Or, just like evil."
105.0,Provider,"Well then, let's look over it again. So yeah that we can do that love doing that it's awfully important for people, and this is typically the one that is is a go to for most people at this point, this is the one they use to."
3539.0,Patient,get them.
105.0,Provider,"Back in the body and to let the body know that that it's safe alright so let's persevere here we've got I want to stop smoking, you can."
3539.0,Patient,"Tell me very good, so I would say right now i'm about. i've cut down. I would say about three a day right now. Three cigarettes a day so i'm a lot lot less so i'm not totally done and quit but i'm I feel like i'm getting closer to that."
105.0,Provider,"You sure are that's great. looks like in July, you were at nine or 10 so that's that's a significant drop."
3539.0,Patient,wow yeah.
105.0,Provider,"Nice So how are you doing it, why don't you identify the things that you do to make it possible to to have reduced it to three a day."
3539.0,Patient,"um I am definitely doing a lot of. Again self talk. My health. my daughter it's a lot of. A lot of that, but also, I think what helped boost the start of this was when I started getting a little sick and. I really again I don't really know eating habits, I don't know just started getting really sick and just not being able to really. figure it out, and then I I couldn't really see when i'm sick I can't smoke cigarettes to it like like they'll get makes me more six or don't and I feel like I kind of reduced. I didn't smoke at all for like a whole day and then the next day, I would just take a drag and then it would make me sick and then I would. wouldn't smoke till the next day, so I wasn't smoking really I was like taking maybe a dragon during a day, just to kind of get rid of that craving but no cigarettes. So, then, that was it was like that, for a little over a week, and so, when I stopped feeling sick I started, you know smoking again and stuff but i've definitely noticed right away that I couldn't even finish a full cigarette. So I was like wow, this is a really like that sucks that I was sick. But dang this is really kind of a good thing, like I I can't really smoke now like had smoke as much, so I didn't try to wasn't trying to I would just put my cigarette out halfway so with That being said, i'm at about three a day right now. And it also helps that i'm at work, because I can't smoke that work."
105.0,Provider,"yeah that's convenient. yeah right. And then, this is, I want to accept more of what I cannot change so that's sort of a. mindset, what do we look out for the objective client will notice thinking, she is right. And instead increase breathing and thinking through self talk is this me problem, are you problem, so those were this is created some time ago, but what are you noticing around you know, this is something certainly we've talked about catching yourself. Pursuing maybe an argument note to however you define that but just needing to be right, making your points more times than not versus. acceptance and maybe leaning into curiosity and understanding, where the other person's going coming from. With this is specifically suggesting here is to two things at once, one is the breath work we just talked about, and then it's also. Is this that framework that that montrose this meet problem Do I need to take action on something that's what this supposed to do is something I need to address someone made an observation. How much is that is true for me much just a little bit of a seems to be more about a problem that someone else needs to work out so are you going to that thinking."
3539.0,Patient,"way. i'm excited about this one, because this is a huge one for me and I that's you know, going back to when this started and as much as we've talked about it, and as much as you've probably seen it come up and things. Other things well, but this is an issue and I were I I work on it a lot, and so I think I think that i've been doing really good with it as a matter of fact, for a really quick example just very recently with my sister. And even just I think of a couple of things right away, so I I can I definitely feel like i'm doing a lot better with that and I I feel more confident with it. But my both of my sisters, so one of them being the one that told me my sister Carol she actually you know us getting over an argument and she tells me that she's noticed I talk about my counseling a lot and how it helps and sometimes i'll throw up things i've learned or something. What she you know when we're arguing or in the midst of things afterwards, the other day she told me that she's noticed in a way that I that I talk when we're like fighting or about to fight or you know something's going on, you were getting upset with each other. You know the change in the way that I talked to her. And she says she really loves it and she appreciates it and. I don't know she kind of got more into detail so it's definitely you know me not. i'm doing so much better with that I don't want to get all wrapped up in detail, but my other sister same thing. It was an argument I actually did have an argument with her like. I don't know this was probably like a week ago, or so, and she. said she was just really upset saying things and I just decided that I didn't want to. Fight I didn't want to be in this fight with her, and it was just so stupid and small, and it was. I knew that she was so mad and frustrated and we were just going to get past this and you know, whatever so I just. I I did a lot of thinking and I just kind of let her go while she was texting and stuff and I didn't say anything. I didn't say anything back at all, and it was I didn't feel like it was super hard that time like it wasn't like I had to sit on my hands or something, but I did have to do a little bit of. Like self talk and things like that."
105.0,Provider,"So it might seem well, I actually do want to know how you did it, so I know. I have, I have a sense. Of the story, the second one you just shared. That you your motivation was I don't want to be in the argument you're able to sort of, say, this is a small issue it's not worth maybe pursuing being right over winning winning the point you changing their mind. And I know you said it was self taught but i'm curious about. What you said."
3539.0,Patient,"We think about the argument itself. I said to myself, I don't want to fight with my sister. It puts me in a really emotional place when I fight with my family or i'm not talking to somebody or like you know something like that I just start feeling really distant and empty and I start getting kind of sad so. i'm trying, I feel like i'm trying to avoid places like that, so I just and it hurts I don't want to fight with my sister. This is not something that feels important enough to start a fight about you know and not be able to talk to her and. You know her feelings are just her right now she'll be okay and she'll get over it soon, and you guys can talk about it when she's cool down, so I basically told myself there's a better time through this like there's a better time to to talk about it, without fighting. I feel like there's something else there, but I can't really think. What i'm trying to say okay."
105.0,Provider,"Well, you shared a little bit that you're aware of the impact that if you end up. Fighting. It will, I think I think you said it will make you emotional you'll have a big emotional response to it."
3539.0,Patient,Yes.
105.0,Provider,"So if the content wasn't worth pursuing, in other words the misunderstanding or something really didn't need correction she you were able to maybe go to she has a right to her perspective. And those are her feelings, there were not always you know you're learning slowly how to share your internal world with I feel. doesn't mean other people are doing that so they're still going to tell stories to try to get how they feel inside cross the chasm to this other person you so they they don't typically do it because you're in here learning how to how to share so they're still going to tell stories. And it's a you have a choice. to sort of noticing the troubled by it or to misunderstand where you can get clarification and ask about it, it sounds like in the ones you just shared you did all the work inside you and just kind of went quiet."
3539.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
105.0,Provider,So if for a moment on just linger on this goal for a little longer because that's a big that's a big step for a lot of people. In order for you to do that in order for you to remain quiet and to not help sister right.
3539.0,Patient,"What you said remain quiet and that word stands out so big to me right now, because this fight is ongoing and even as just like last night I found out my sister is like calling everyone in my family and saying things because she thinks that i'm mad and. she thinks that i'm. But i'm just sitting here i'm not so anyway, the view yeah i'm sorry i'm listening."
105.0,Provider,"hey yeah so that's Okay, so that contents helpful because there's a misunderstanding out there it's out there it's still out there there's a they're operating and making decisions on a perspective. That is not true for."
3539.0,Patient,Excuse me.
105.0,Provider,"So that probably takes a lot, and so this is back to where I was going, which was so cognitive behavioral for just a second. If that's true that you can remain calm let's say just use the word COM that goes with quiet, but let's use calm for a moment, meaning. Not emotion arguing fixing making sure texting or one. yeah so just just sort of still so your remaining still in the presence of a misunderstanding out there. If that's true which we're we're saying it is today, what does that say. about who you are. we're going to ask that i'm probably going to ask that question a few times over and over that's what this does is it gets it gets to that underlying belief about yourself so so just answer that one does not overthink it."
3539.0,Patient,Okay um. Let me repeat it to myself out loud. least with a situation and. Remaining quiet and calm. What do I think about myself.
105.0,Provider,"Well it's specific it's more like this, the fact that i'm remaining calm and there is misinformation out there. What does that say about who I am who I believe I am that's more the question. Okay here remaining quiet not pursuing making sure they change their mind i'm not doing that, so what you are doing remaining still while there is a misunderstanding out there floating around what does that say. About."
3539.0,Patient,That i'm a. mature person.
105.0,Provider,"Okay, so good let's keep going with that one, so if that's true if i'm mature go to the next level below that what does that say about what who you are keep going with it just keep asking that same question."
3539.0,Patient,i'm mature.
105.0,Provider,Maybe ask what do I believe I am.
3539.0,Patient,I think I am. I would say. that's a tough one mature.
105.0,Provider,"Look get a visual instead you know don't get hung up on the words too much, but just sort of picture."
3539.0,Patient,"i'm just trying to like I put my words together. I feel that I would be so, if I am mature about it, I feel that. I am. I can't find the word i'm looking for like i'm picturing things in my head, but I can't."
105.0,Provider,"Well, tell me what you see what's the picture."
3539.0,Patient,"I will not good great better nothing like that i'm just I see confidence, I see myself great. i'm comfortable."
105.0,Provider,"So i'm confident so that's that's a good one, you fought that didn't need to it's right there i'm confidence and. go under that one, so if that's true i'm confident, I believe that I am what."
3539.0,Patient,i'm responsible.
105.0,Provider,"Okay, if that's true what does that say about who I am."
3539.0,Patient,would say. i'm a. hard working independent. woman in a great mom.
105.0,Provider,"Okay, and if all of those things are true, what do you believe yourself to be do you believe about you. At the core that's what we're trying to get."
3539.0,Patient,A good person.
105.0,Provider,"yeah so now if we come back up bubble back up to the surface, if that's been operating during this text, exchange and all the doings if i'm a good person. This can exist and be true, even in the presence of people miss interpreting you misunderstanding. You get to still be a good person. So there's if that's true, it turns out that there can be misunderstanding going on all around you. And you get to remain a good person it's not in jeopardy it doesn't get touched. That is different than the way you are interacting with the world before it deeply threatened to this if we say this in my hand is the i'm a good person, it was subject to and vulnerable to. All of the opinions. And you fought very hard to protect it, to make sure that it matched your self concept, they need to see me as a good person i'm a good person, so there was a lot of energy put into that and what we just saw today, I think. Is you didn't feel the need to do it. Now i'm not saying that's not coming up, it would be convenient if people saw you the same way, you see yourself right it's uncomfortable. But what you, you took a chance was just remaining still. And you're getting a chance to see. Your okay. Now you're in the midst of it, maybe you'll turn left or right, you may go back and and seek clarification and want to say hey looks like things are going on and just want to let you know i'm not actually mad i'm looks like there was some assumptions i'm. Pretty happy enjoying you know my training kind of excited and you know, whatever your truth is, you may decide to go the route of clarification, but i'm giving you this sort of. mirroring back of what i'm seeing. In you, which is you stood still you just stay. quiet. And in order for you to do that, that fundamental sense of i'm a good person is getting more and more solid that's what it looks like."
3539.0,Patient,It feels like that a little bit.
105.0,Provider,"A little bit yeah that matters doesn't happen overnight right because it took a while of eroding the sense of self you know when you were little etc, and, over time, and it takes time to get that that confidence back that sense that. I know who I am I know i'm a good person and I don't need them all the them's to tell me it's so."
3539.0,Patient,"yeah it feels like I was in this like oh God I don't know who I am what i'm doing what I want. To do like this, I don't know and then you get to where I feel like i'm at right now, as I think I know and then hopefully, of course, like you said and takes time and then in the future i'll be in a place where I can say I know yeah."
105.0,Provider,"And it will get easier and now and what will happen i'm predicting anyway, is the defensiveness the. Getting offended and irritated and would probably say angry i'm angry and, of course, then sad. Is it'll go down you'll be able to be around people that just project, they just make assumptions they project and it's really inconvenient, it would be so much more convenient people would say Arielle how are you feeling. Are you angry with me wouldn't it be nice that people spoke directly but we don't. yeah we don't. And, but this is a start, because look what becomes possible when you're calm. Then, your brain is going to work so much more efficient and you're going to be able to say things like hey Carol I think what normally you know. We would do is, we would all assume that i'm mad. which was true I was, I was mad sometimes because there was misunderstanding, I just want you to know i'm doing some work, you know i'm in therapy and I have this growth and. I think convenient that you guys don't see that what I am is actually concerned i'm making up a story zone that the content i'm actually concerned about blah blah blah. i'm not i'm not mad at you guys and and hey how is cousin so so you know you can fluidly just comfortably talk about something else there's not there's no and why don't you guys just see me that way and and and you know this pushing to get them to change. Will will not be there. it'll be the same as no I actually prefer the red. Whatever versus the blue it doesn't have all the heat behind it. yeah, but when you're threatened when the sense of self is threatened. there's going to be a lot more animation a lot more heat and you're going to be fighting hard to get them to match, you know your self perception you're going to fight hard for it."
3539.0,Patient,yeah that's when that heat comes in your.
105.0,Provider,"yeah yeah so so take some pride in in the progress that you're making you know and and see perhaps I mean are your days less. Intense is there, less rumination is there, less crying is there, less energy spent in that why, why would they do this if they love me why would they do this, why would they think this is there, less circling around that why why why."
3539.0,Patient,"Definitely, I will pay attention to that stuff. And I know that the answer to that is yes, even just thinking back to like a really recent one. Okay i'm just that's why it's not hurting so bad because i'm not doing that whole like oh my God why why why why. Why. Is Why is this happening. I can definitely admit the one of the hard ones is still. My boyfriend I feel like. that's one of the ones where i'll go to that right away. there's so much fear and sadness and know why why Why is this happening and. Then I really need to work on to it. I need to work on that one."
105.0,Provider,"well. Are you able to see and again this is just an assumption I don't know that this is true, but if it is that what that why all that questioning has given you is an out. To not have to make a decision, remember we've talked about that yeah if we stop asking why instead you just go inside of you, and you get to register what you like and what you don't. And those are your boundaries, and here we are back to basics again and we that's what happens, we get super complex but we're going to come down to some some fundamentals. I don't like this, I have noticing it's been this way for years. hmm wonder how much longer i'm going to tolerate this, or maybe i'll throw a solution at it boy now let's have a sit down and I, I want to talk about i've been. i've been compromising you know this particular boundary for a while really uncomfortable with it and it's making me nervous about the future can you make a change so. it's not just one one thing, but what stopping the analysis means is that everybody has to be accountable for themselves, he will have to work it out, she will have to work it out, you stay centered in your preference. Center they're like this."
3539.0,Patient,"one's always been like. But I did want to say I don't know if this was one of my goals, specifically, but I. I was speaking with the financial advisor for CNN. So i've got. kind of a list written down with my process steps and things that I need to do what to do next, and stuff so I can try to get myself enrolled and, hopefully, maybe. January."
105.0,Provider,"So fighting, are you kidding me."
3539.0,Patient,"yeah i'm really excited what you just were saying right now is making me think of. Like I need to focus on myself more and that's what I was thinking about on this. time we had an argument my boyfriend and I was i'm focusing so much on him and my feelings getting hurt and what he's doing and not doing. If I would be focusing more on myself and my you know what i'm doing and being so excited about this and my school and stuff I thought about that right away like, if I can do this, then. Focusing on myself, it does it just takes away that you know i'm not i'm not wasting all my energy and my time looking at this issue in this problem and instead i'm looking. spending more time my focus on this stuff that i'm doing, and you know. These things that are. Just exciting to me are going to help me, you know get where I need to be and stuff so I just I kind of like. I don't know it's almost like I forget about it for a few weeks, and then I then I go back to it and i'm like Oh, what is he doing. Know we're, why are we so distant or like whatever the issue is at that point so but I just noticed that about myself when I when I do that. It just it really helps so anyways I did, and it was it just so happened, it was after our argument, and it was just the next day it was a day later I just decided. That That was something that I, it was like a big push like I need to do this, I really want to do that, so I called and I, I mean I didn't actually go sign papers and and get myself enrolled but. I got this like big push in this rush of I really need to do this, I need to do this, I need to do this now, I really want to do this, like it was just. This weird I don't know how to explain it, but then I just called and I started just trying to get information asking a bunch of questions and."
105.0,Provider,"So watch watch just that transaction. let's just again we don't know if this is what's operating, but if it is Look how neatly it fits if what you had done let's say before you had an argument. And you went into your why, how could he and then you push back at him how could you do this if you love me you've been with it, but you kept pushing it right. Which sort of like the way you would go about it in the past, but instead, what you did I think was you don't like his behavior and it's possible. You became aware that you don't want to spend time focusing on that and, possibly, maybe. A future where you're responsible for your own money your own independence and it clicked for you."
3539.0,Patient,i'm not good. that's what it feels like. yeah that's what it feels. Like a little bit if it's like.
105.0,Provider,"So I I had closed. I made it an achievement and enroll in the school didn't come back up as a goal i'm put it back in there, but now we just need to put. A new objective, something that maybe you can accomplish in a month or two something that you can do one of these small steps, what would that what do you think that would be."
3539.0,Patient,"I would say, see before enrolling I can."
105.0,Provider,Anything with transcripts or money that needs to be done.
3539.0,Patient,"I was gonna say I can make sure i'm just make sure all of my. My applications for my love my loan applications are in. Make sure I complete so complete all school loan applications, we can support it. and Even the APP just all any on any applications application, I would say financial any financial applications, make sure I get those finished my books."
105.0,Provider,And are you have you gone so far as to get a sense of what semester you actually do want to enroll you get a sense of that.
3539.0,Patient,"i'm i'm still kind of thinking about it because i'm like I really want to start, I think he said January. Is I could start in January, if I did it now i'm pretty sure he said January, I have to double check I wrote everything down. But if I did that, and then I started thinking okay so it's October, you know so November, December I got two months, and then I start thinking okay well. what's going on, so that's where my my problem is, as I start thinking about what's happening in the world in my life or what's happening in my life outside of school like, how can I scare myself some more. scare myself some more and all these. All these things are going to make me feel like I. Just don't know what I do myself."
105.0,Provider,said I was like another thing stop.
3539.0,Patient,"Stop just stop doing that just stopped doing that to yourself, you can't do that to yourself okay restart go back to the beginning. i'll start like okay i'm going to do this i'm going to do this and then i'll i'll just kind of just rewind and then start from the beginning, just and tell myself to stop doing that stop thinking about that."
105.0,Provider,"yeah your ability to manage these you know these sort of wandering cats, you know, for you to sort of wrangle these thoughts that wander around. It is is having a profound impact on you, the end so it goes by lots of different names, you know. Right now i'm thinking oh she's able to sort of interrupt the scare tactic part, the one that says what if what if you know and does that and you're able to interrupt that that part of you that wants to completely take over. you're able to sort of quiet it and say now right now I don't need that kind of inquiry. and go back to what, what do you go back to I really want to go to school, I really want to have a master's degree, I really want to be a counselor therapist, what do you go back to what, what do you bounce back to that keeps you excited."

105.0,Provider,"Well that's a that's a convenient one because that motivation is not likely to go anywhere, you know it's that's a solid thing that continues to be something that. You can leverage to motivate yourself when. Your own passions and interests are not enough. But you're picking something that it's not like you're picking something. that's outside your field of interest you're picking something that interests you.

A lot of benefits there that I loved as well and, but still it's the love of my. The love of the job, I want to have that love of the job, not just go be a nurse, because you might get paid more or oh you'll have more. You might have more hours of time off with your daughter and that's what I was thinking about with stuff like that, but like it's I still go back to my passion for the for it.
