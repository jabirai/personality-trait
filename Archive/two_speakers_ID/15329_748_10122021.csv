15329.0,Patient,Hello.
748.0,Provider,"hi i'm sorry, you had to wait."
15329.0,Patient,No worries it's like a regular doctor's office.
748.0,Provider,"Well, and your appointment is just starting now and I couldn't notify you because I was in a session with someone else. Nowhere else. Okay, good well welcome."
15329.0,Patient,Thank you.
748.0,Provider,"Yes, and is this your first appointment with bright hurt. Yes, okay great so I have a series of questions but, more than anything, what i'd like is for you to just. Let me know who you are and what brought you here and. How will support you."
15329.0,Patient,"Well, I was diagnosed bipolar at 16 and i've been in and out of therapies ever since on and off medications you know the cycle goes you get feeling good. Who wants to take medication when you're feeling great so you know, and then I get in crisis and I go back in therapy I get back on drugs. and go through the process over and over and over again, and I have about a five year cycle for my highs and my loose to play out completely. And i'm about three years in after my last low, but this last time I went into therapy, without being in crisis, I decided that I wanted to be proactive, because I was told. Because i'm getting older, if I have a psychotic break it could be a permanent break and I could end up on the street not not recognizing myself so i'm taking my mental health really seriously. Although i'm not doing drugs I at this point in time i'm not playing the drug yo yo game, I have a 23 years old and i've developed a toolbox of tools to help me I meditate I do yoga i'm working on some Chai tea. I have a bipolar disorder and a hip problem and that's all I have everything else is fine normal I mean i'm overweight, but i'm working on that because I have to lose 25 pounds before I can have the surgery. For a double hip replacement, which I just saw the doctor last week on Thursday or Friday in Davis, and he was really excited. about my progress, so what I need is just a little mental health support will I make it through the next six to a year because he says can take about six months to a year. To finish, all the surgery because they're only going to do one, at a time, blah blah blah and I gotta heal so it's a process, you know. But i'm on a health healthy attitude on eating right i've already lost 25 pounds I stopped to lose 25 more pounds which isn't going to be a problem at all because i'm motivated to do it because I want this pain to go away, I live in constant a level 10 pain pretty much all the time. I manage that, with meditation and CDs and edibles nighttime because that's, the only way I can sleep. Other than that, I don't take any drugs ibuprofen that's the strongest i'll take because I saw my dad my dad was addicted to painkillers at the end, and he turned into a illegal drug addict and i'm like. I didn't like seeing my hero that way, and so I said i'm not going to do that, I have a daughter, and I want to teach her mind over matter i've always taught her that she's gonna be 30 next year and i'm like. Mine over matter watch mama go through all this in tenseness without any pharmaceuticals so that's where i'm at all healthy."
748.0,Provider,It sounds like you were diagnosed bipolar one.
15329.0,Patient,That i'm not sure honestly I couldn't tell you I don't.
748.0,Provider,"Have a really severe breaks in your life okay all right 16 is young, for that, but. I think you said 1616."
15329.0,Patient,"Yes, yeah."
748.0,Provider,"Okay. And and good for you for being here on your own and doing it, so that you can get the support you need to go to the next step in your life, which is to feel good again physically, as well as mentally and emotionally. Exactly you're saying you're not taking drugs you mean you're not taking medication that's. prescribed even."
15329.0,Patient,"Right i'm not taking the only the only thing i'm doing is CBD sets it nothing else see it well, I take the edibles and those aren't CBD so if have the thc and i'm but. that's it that's. yeah and i've grown my own, and I make my own gummy so, then I know what chemicals are in it, and I know what additives are in it, and I know the calorie Count of it so i'm able to incorporate into my diet and it works out really well for me so."
748.0,Provider,"Well wow that's really great you have learned to advocate for yourself, you are to monitor you've learned that's phenomenal and how do you ward off the intensity of a psychotic break."
15329.0,Patient,"Just by evaluating the feelings and becoming more of an observer now, instead of diving into those ideas or thoughts or whatever drives me and to my psychosis in one direction or the other. I observed them now. i'm I become the observer in my own mind and i'm like hmm where is this coming from okay well let's let's hug this out, you know, and I do a lot of self. healing counseling I have conferences i'm the CEO of my little aura and I work on me from the inside out and try to. You know i'm sure i'm sure there's not always things that I catch but i'm not having a problem where i'm walking down the street. Trying to see when I know my kind of mania presents itself once i'm like Jesus, and all I want to do is walk around and spread love and joy and I don't care about my personal safety I don't care about. You know the the normal things that people should care about all I care about is being out on the street and spreading love and joy and. I don't know it's kind of I get this God complex thing going on. So i've learned to manage that to with more spiritual education grounding myself things you know if i'm going to pretend like i'm gonna feel like i'm God or than I need to ground myself like God would. You know i'm instead of arguing with myself about these things now i'm kind of like okay Well, this is how we're going to look at the world. Then, what can we do to protect ourselves so it's more that's where my you know so when my psychosis starts, because it does start there i'm not gonna lie and say oh i'm perfect I don't need medication. Because I do I have zyprexa and i've lithium on hand if things get out of control they're there for me to to dose up and I keep my prescription handy I know where it's at if I need it. doesn't. You know, so I have it's part of my toolbox like I said, I have a huge toolbox of things and I drink a lot too. and have like those conversations I put them in paper, and then I can read back, and I can look and see wow that's where I was Okay, you know part of that observation and and i'm trying to take a scientific approach to my own mental health, I don't know if that. makes sense, but yeah."
748.0,Provider,"Really really careful self monitoring, I hear that very."
15329.0,Patient,Very yes.
748.0,Provider,wow so What was it like for you growing up with that that must have been really challenging and did your family support you and.
15329.0,Patient,"Not so no that's why i'm i'm I learned to take care of me, because my family thought. That, if I was misdiagnosed they thought I didn't have anything going on, that I was making it up and there was all a lie and blah blah blah. And then, as life got went on, you know, I was like okay well, maybe you know, maybe i'm not as crazy, as you say, I am blah blah blah, but then you know, like a postpartum depression. That that triggered That was a trigger you know and. And then, at that point they're like okay well let's get you on some medication, because now you're a mom and you got to take care of this child and you can't even keep your feet on the ground and you think that you just want to go crazy in your. Car runs on magic juice, you know kind of situation and and so yeah that's when they finally took me seriously when there was another life involved wanting to kill myself and acting crazy wasn't enough for them, it had to happen until my daughter was born so. How when I."
748.0,Provider,When she was born.
15329.0,Patient,"I was 23. So yeah. yeah so it's been a minute, since I you know figured out something wasn't right with me. yeah yeah, but I also learned that you know if i'd been born into it native American or let's say and more tribal culture and. Amazonian forest tribe or something they would have seen me for a bipolar as being a shaman material, and I would have been trained and taught how to navigate these extremes. That, I feel, and the emotions that I feel culturally instead of. You know you don't have a problem let's just put you in the closet you know, because that was a generation, I was raised from to it's like we don't talk about our problems are problems are swept under the carpet and we don't deal with them. So you know i've really had to find my own path, and all this and. Without the support the only person, I can say that truly supports my growth and my. My exploration of what it is to be bipolar is my daughter because she's lived with her entire life she knows her mom's a little. sees the world a little differently, you know and she's a good mirror for me to you know if I talk to her, and I say something in, and I can tell she's like wait a minute mom wait a minute Where are you at And what are we. What page, are you on. And so, then it helps me think Oh, maybe, maybe, or maybe she's just not ready to hear that you know, so it helps me be the observer by using her as part of my sounding board."
748.0,Provider,And where she now.
15329.0,Patient,"She she's only 20 minutes away from me. Okay yeah she's not very far I saw her yesterday as a matter of fact and i'm going to see you again tomorrow, so those are always the good days I like when I see my daughter at this point in time, you know. That it's Nice. To talk with all."
748.0,Provider,her life.
15329.0,Patient,Was that.
748.0,Provider,What she doing in her life.
15329.0,Patient,"Oh she's she's married to her husband she doesn't have to work, her husband has a great job she she's like i'm a 50s housewife i'm like good for you."
748.0,Provider,Good you agree.
15329.0,Patient,"No, no, she doesn't want him she doesn't want to, I have four legged grandkids she has seven pits. Oh cats and dogs so i'm like okay i'm all right, with four legs that's okay. Something I know her husband just went through a vasectomy so they don't have plans to have children of their own, maybe someday they'll adopt, but you know they want to travel, they got. different priorities and a lot of her, I find that a lot of people her age her friend groups don't want to have kids, so I think well, maybe it's the earth. biologically like we can't sustain this population anymore, so we gotta slow down and biologically that generations, just like hey you know what I don't want to have kids it's not so important, so. it's Okay, I wanted it, but then I come to terms with the fact that i'm Okay, with just being her mom that's all right. yeah that is more than enough."
748.0,Provider,"And are you connected to her husband, are you close to him is that relationship."
15329.0,Patient,"it's it's evolved it's definitely evolved it's gotten way more better now I knew him before her, she met him through me. And he is seven years older than she is so when they met at 16 he was 23 and she was seven I mean 16 and I was like wait a minute, this is not Okay, because I was a tutor at the College and he was one of my co workers. And they had an industry summer Barbecue, and so I had her come with this, for the work Barbecue and that's where they met, and I saw it was love, at first sight, as soon as they locked eyes. It was on and I knew it too is like oh my God oh my God it's my 16 year olds last. You know, but now there's they're married they got married three years ago and they've been together, ever since and. they're happy couple, and you know they got their life planned out he takes really good care of her and she's very well adjusted and safe and. So yeah I enjoy Greg I I do enjoy Greg now and he's he's good with finances so he's been able to give me some solid financial advice so that's been good yeah. So yeah so we got a great relationship, I mean I wouldn't say it's lovey dovey but you know he's my son in law and we're not close, but he doesn't get in the way of me and my daughter either, and it does support our relationships so that's important."
748.0,Provider,"that's fantastic Okay, so it sounds like your current family is good and you're the family, you grew up in sounds like it just wanted to put things under the rug oh yeah what elephant in the middle of the living room."
15329.0,Patient,"I don't want. yep exactly and they've all passed away and so that's been liberating actually when my mom died because she's a source, a lot of my pain. When my mom died, I was a lighter this just I felt the lifting and. i've mourned her and and I felt her presence around me one day I just felt a big huge energy hug it just felt like a huge hug and I knew it was my mom gave me a hug and I actually feel closer and I love her more now that she's gone. Then she was when she was here and I don't feel guilty about that at all, because she. deserved with whatever Karma she got from the way she treated me, you know it was bad it was. really, really."
748.0,Provider,"know what. You were abused, when you."
15329.0,Patient,"Oh totally I was physically emotionally and. mentally abused from the my first memory my uncle took my virginity at the age of five and my mom was the one that had talked me into bed that night. So, and that and just a couple summers ago to know that summer last summer I had a major breakthrough, I remembered that the abuse with my uncle stopped at the age of 16 for some reason I did not remember from age five to 16. All these years I wiped it out and then suddenly I remembered and I had to go through that whole process of healing all that and. He had swim trunks any doors where when we go swimming and every time we'd go swimming his fingers would end up inside me, and so I had to take those swim trunks and I had to put them in a. container and set them on fire inside my mind, because they they just haunted me as soon as I had the memory, every time I close my eyes, I saw those ugly swim trunks that he always wore. And it was it was just a horrible experience to relive because it's been explained to me that my brain doesn't know time. So my brain was reliving as I remembered them, I was in that time, and so I had some bladder issues last year, where all of a sudden, I was incontinent just like a little kid pain in their bed all the time. So I had to work some through some major seven now, I can tell my story and I don't feel the pain I don't have tears in my eyes. i'm sharing with you, so I know that i'm healed more than I was because I couldn't share the story with anybody before I couldn't even share it with myself before so. it's a huge a huge huge breakthrough, I had and i'm feeling really empowered because I was able to compartmentalize his swim trunks and put them away it just felt so good, to keep that. Because I call it a fire like you get one thought in your head in it burns like wildfire and takes over your entire brain cells until they're all thinking about that one thought over and over and over again. Well, I stopped that fire, you know i've learned to that was a good learning lesson I could put those fires out without them having to turn into a giant uncontainable firestorm in my brain."
748.0,Provider,wow that's great good for you good for.
15329.0,Patient,yeah it's hard. To tell you working on the insides of heavy lifting it is.
748.0,Provider,"Absolutely, the heaviest lifting you will ever do. yep there is."
15329.0,Patient,"No, no, I will understand it at all, no one will ever get it, because they don't know what your list and."
748.0,Provider,"yeah and and you know it's challenging because you've done this for years, so you know when you're comfortable with it, but when you talk to somebody who's really new to it, they think oh it'll just be a week or so i'll just you know and i'll be fine."
15329.0,Patient,yep.
748.0,Provider,it's a process.
15329.0,Patient,"it's a total process total process and I plan on it at some point writing it all down and sharing my my experience, because maybe I can help somebody else you know."
748.0,Provider,"really want to acknowledge what you said about your mom to the you know when you when people leave this plane when they leave their bodies, they leave all that baggage and ego and and it is easier to connect with them. down a loving space, then."
15329.0,Patient,"yeah much easier much easier I don't have no. I mean, I used to I had to take care of my mom for the last year and a half of her life, because no one else wouldn't she got to the point where my dad had already passed and she she couldn't do it, she needed help. And I had I had to put away a lot of resentment and anger and hatred and I mean I had to really work on myself just to help her. Because it's hard to give someone their pills when you're standing behind them saying choke choke choke you know it's so hard. But I did it and the reward was super mega healing it was all worth it all the hill all the torture everything i've been through my entire life was all worth it, if I got to heal from it, and I feel like i'm well on the way to healing from all these traumas that happened during my lifetime."
748.0,Provider,sounds like you have really had a lot of them did you have siblings.
15329.0,Patient,uh huh yep.
748.0,Provider,"Oh, they when mom was sick."
15329.0,Patient,"So no. No need to. lay down yeah nowhere nowhere mm hmm nope my I have adopted brother, I have a half sister, and I have a brother. And my brother came to see her maybe once a month, and that was it and. They drove by her house every day because she was living in an Assisted Living facility and they drove right that pass where she was living every day to take their daughter to college, because they wouldn't let her drive. And my mom could see the College out her balcony. You know the launch of the College was right there and they drove by every day and katie couldn't come by her granddaughter couldn't come by her adult granddaughter that was in college couldn't come by to visit her grandma. and check on her and maybe do a little laundry or something for you know my mom didn't have enough money to get the full on care that they offer it those assisted livings are expensive. You know so. yeah it's definitely expensive, you know you got to have good retirement plan for that stuff. And she didn't so yeah it was it don't want me being the oldest and her only living well she's got another daughter somewhere that i've never met from a previous marriage, but you know, technically, I was her oldest daughter. living with her that needed to take care of her so I I took on the responsibility because that's who I am I wasn't gonna let my mom set and P pants just wasn't going to happen. she's a human being, regardless of how I emotionally felt about her, she was a human being and she deserved some kind of. dignity and respect on that level and that's what I gave her you know I treated her just like another patient in the doctor's office or you know if I was a caregiver for someone that I wasn't emotionally attached to it wasn't easy. I did a lot of crying and a lot of calling my support team and oh my God I can't believe this novel blah blah blah, you know, but I survived and I healed. It was worth it."
748.0,Provider,good for you. that's incredible so what would you most hope to get out of your time at bright heart health.
15329.0,Patient,"More understanding that i'm really actually excited about the the group therapy groups. Okay, because I want other people's perspective on what it is to be you know bipolar or have some kind of psychotic issues or things going on. From their perspective, you know because I have a feeling that maybe just maybe some of it's not as bad as we think it is, I know I know there's some really bad stuff that can happen to us because we don't care about. things and we don't see it, the way society sees it, but I also know that there's some really good stuff that we don't see the same way society does but it gets discounted because we're bipolar or we're psychotic or. You know skits a frantic or whatever so i'm really excited about the groups to be in a group and hear other people's stories and learn from them. and get a different perspective on because I know what my life's be like I know how it is for me to do with it, but what if someone else dealing with how are other people. Handling because I don't have that support group in my circle, you know I don't have a history there's no one else my family diagnosed and there's no one in my life diagnosed. i'm sure there's people, but you know. That yeah."
748.0,Provider,Absolutely so none of your siblings have manifested anything that okay.
15329.0,Patient,Interesting no. No.
748.0,Provider,"Okay i'm in you know I I mean I can't speak for every group, by any stretch of the imagination, I just started with bright heart so but I will say that most people in groups that I have experienced over the years that are in programs tend to be medicated."
15329.0,Patient,"Okay. well. I have been medicated most of my life, this is the first time in my life, where i'm like no, you can go ahead and prescribe them but I tell you i'm not going to take him. You know and and they've been Okay, with the doctors have been okay with it so far they've all been understanding, but you're right it's everywhere, though it's, not just in group it's everywhere it's how we treat it with how we treat here's a drug, take a drug. So now it's everywhere. and i'm okay with that, but i'm not gonna."
748.0,Provider,"i'm gonna do your research. Groups specifically. geared toward people who. see what was that. There was a term that used to be used a lot. When I was first getting my. Around the time that I got my masters. spiritual. spiritual. That paralleled what people call a psychotic break with a spiritual break spirit in there, there was a term for that and i'm going to actually look it up because i'm driving myself crazy. i'm gonna see if it pulls up spiritual emergence."
15329.0,Patient,"Ah Okay, I like that."
748.0,Provider,um yeah and and another term is spiritual emergency. Okay um and actually I can. There used to be a place in California and i'm pretty sure it was in Marin county. With not a.
15329.0,Patient,Car yeah.
748.0,Provider,"So it's not that far I don't think it exists anymore, but I have been sort of out of the loop i'll be honest about that i'm going to put it in the chat for you. Okay, this isn't a blog on. On psychology today magazine."
15329.0,Patient,Oh nice okay.
748.0,Provider,I website. And it is on psychosis versus spiritual emergency I just put it in.
15329.0,Patient,"Oh, those good reading all right i'll i'll check that out this afternoon, yes."
748.0,Provider,"And because you know, one of the things that is. It doesn't make it any easier to walk the walk you're walking it, but what it does do is it takes out some of the intense. Well there's really another no other word for labeling that gets done in our in our culture. and other written it's one more place that we other you're not like me, you know whether it's race or culture or. Male female or LGBT Q, or any of those mental health is another whole arena that gets other and and it is an easy to take your power back the way that you are."
15329.0,Patient,"yeah no it's it's a hard it's a hard rock, especially when you're up against a culture that's like wait a minute wait man hey man like you said you're you're not like me, you there's something wrong with you huh. yeah we don't match mm hmm."
748.0,Provider,"yeah seems like you have really come to terms with your reality being Okay, is what it is."
15329.0,Patient,"yeah yeah yeah I have, I totally have, and no one can tell me that it's not okay. You know me and became money more."
748.0,Provider,"And also that. You know, it even an m, and I even here, I was thinking, how do I want to say this, I even hear that you don't carry a lot of resentment or blame me more about the fact that a lot of it came out of trauma."
15329.0,Patient,"nope no, I see this fortune fire now that's how I see it, and when you're fortunate fire you're grateful for that fire because it forged too hard yeah I mean i'm not a hard person bait you know I i'm i'm not. too hard situations i've turned into a diamond is what I feel like inside that's how I feel I feel like a diamond with many sparkling facets, instead of a lump of coal that was you know. I was just forged by pressure I don't know, I think, honestly, I believe I picked this path. So that I would find my light and so that I would find you know in these hard dark times is when you're going to find the lights can find out what you're made of house, would you find out if you weren't pressed and hardened you."
748.0,Provider,never know it's like that Hemingway quote right it's through the cracks that the light gets thing.
15329.0,Patient,"that's right that's right that's exactly it and how are those crackling get there well someone's gotta beat it with a hammer. So yeah. yeah no it's all a choice I i've learned a solid choice because I did I used to hold on to some nasty resentment, but that only made me sicker. That only made me feel worse about myself didn't make me feel proud of, who I am and how far i've come in what i've accomplished, I mean i'm really working on proving to myself that I am a bit of God. You know I did, I do have the gods spark inside, not that I am God that my main he would tell me i'm God, I know i'm not."
748.0,Provider,The. right thing.
15329.0,Patient,"Right yeah whole whole different thing this is more like me carrying around a piece of God, with me wherever I. To I am now."
748.0,Provider,Each of us is spirit manifest right.
15329.0,Patient,yep yep yep.
748.0,Provider,i'd get frank version.
15329.0,Patient,Exactly exactly.
748.0,Provider,All come together to create the whole.
15329.0,Patient,"yep yep yep and spread our love and light as much as we can, and so I try to stay as positive as possible it's not always easy. Especially with you know I just had to learn that. i'm in control of my happiness and the people around me don't have a whole lot of influence on that. Because they used to, and I used to be at the mercy of anybody's emotions around me. Is that I feel them I you know I had the ability to feel these intense emotions and so i'm going to be upset well then i'm upset. You know, and now it's like okay you getting upset okay okay I love you, you know I just stay in that place and I getting triggered less and less and less and less and and now when triggers come i'm like thank you. I can see i've grown, you know, without the triggers i'd have no idea that I could handle them so i'm welcoming triggers in small quantities, so I don't want to get over trigger than end up having to go on medication I don't want that."
748.0,Provider,"No, I have been hospitalized."
15329.0,Patient,"Before, so I don't want that yeah."
748.0,Provider,No yeah that's important just part of the path that you've chosen to really monitor what your energy feels like so that you don't you don't allow the outside intensity to put you in a place that's going to jeopardize your safety or jeopardize your freedom.
15329.0,Patient,Exactly exactly I want to stay sovereign. what's important today right now.
748.0,Provider,You know you pretty much answered it out one other thing what was school like for you.
15329.0,Patient,"I like school I like school and when school was over, I was sad."
748.0,Provider,You enjoyed your school years you did.
15329.0,Patient,"Socially no I don't like people because I don't know how to relate to them, I have a problem with people I do. You know my my friend group is really, really small and. I don't have a problem walking away from people that i've known a long time if they. You know, or I just I don't I don't do people well I just don't i'm more of a hermit I do better on my own, but books I love reading and I love books and."
748.0,Provider,So that was the first school I love and. Love learning.
15329.0,Patient,"Yes, I love the learning, not the people, not the social you know people are mean to each other and. Then, at the time I didn't know how to protect myself from all those energies outside of me, you know, and then I got all these energies inside of me, and there was this huge explosion and I don't like people very much I just don't."
748.0,Provider,"So i'm hearing an interesting thing that i'm very, very familiar with, which is you have this huge love of humanity and unconditional loving nature, but you hate people."
15329.0,Patient,You pretty much pretty much.
748.0,Provider,"Like I totally get that because. You know there's that. Who, we really are when we're shining our lights and who we become as a result of what society and culture does to us right. And like family of origin issues and not everybody looks at their issues."
15329.0,Patient,Right right some people blame their issues on everybody around them.
748.0,Provider,And then become really angry and.

And my roommates like no problem I gotcha I gotcha because she's it a caregiver at heart, you know when I first moved in here she was taking care of a cousin who was bedridden. And so she's like oh no I gotcha I gotcha so. yeah the universe put me here and I gotta say the universe put me here because i'm in the middle of nowhere, because the reason I got here. was because I took care of my mom my mom died, and then I had nowhere. I hadn't I didn't know what to do, I had nothing planned you know I didn't expect you to die so suddenly I thought we were going to stay together for a little while and work through some more stuff I didn't know. And then, it just a friend of a friend said hey I got a couch, and here I am, and so I know the universe put me here, you know I know that and now coven hit and i'm on a farm out in the middle of nowhere so Kobe didn't even disrupt my life because I hardly ever leaving the farm anyway.
