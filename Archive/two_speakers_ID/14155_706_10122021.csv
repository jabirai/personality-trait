14155.0,Patient,"um. Should I camera what you said, but it's basically anxiety."
706.0,Provider,generalized anxiety disorder or is there a specific.
14155.0,Patient,"um it was either that or um yeah I think that was one of them okay having a memory issue that right now um. But basically move this mood mood disorder as well, that my primary care has. diagnosed me with yes."
706.0,Provider,What medications have you been taking.
14155.0,Patient,"depakote. Well i'll just list all the ones I take depakote. twice a day. The lightest dose of it, I believe, and then. dissect will mean for. For ibs and then more recently. lexapro for anxiety."

706.0,Provider,"Oh, excuse me."
14155.0,Patient,um.
706.0,Provider,Well that's good I mean it's good that you are noticing a difference. So. You need you feel like you need something more and that's what what brought you to braveheart or you've discontinued your other provider and then you've switched completely over.
14155.0,Patient,"The therapist I have over there's the one i'm still seeing you know what I intend, on seeing. she's been very, very helpful. As well as bright heart. In just getting certain things under control, such as anxiety and overthinking, which is a huge. huge issue they have had. For quite some time actually okay."
706.0,Provider,"When you say overthinking is that, like racing thoughts that you have."
14155.0,Patient,"racing thoughts over just some of the littlest things I do you know. Okay, wait when i'm thinking about doing something at work, I always over you know I would always overthink my decision making, you know, is this the right move I going to get in trouble for doing this, even though this person told me, this is the right thing to do, but this person didn't. You know, things like that you know I always have that mindset right, I always want to make everyone around me happy, but. Just gets to a point to where it's just it's impossible to do that mm hmm."
706.0,Provider,looks like what we have for diagnosis and you can tell me if this is correct. yeah i'm post traumatic stress disorder. and generalized anxiety disorder.
14155.0,Patient,Is that what. Is that what the file shows.
706.0,Provider,that's what that's what I have on my file yes.
14155.0,Patient,"Now, as far as the ptsd would be concerned. it's not. hard to describe it."
706.0,Provider,Did you have some trauma as a child.
14155.0,Patient,I did have. A bit of a yeah.
706.0,Provider,that's where that comes from. Because i'm as a child is going to give you higher scores on your AC.
14155.0,Patient,Which is.
706.0,Provider,And so that's where that post traumatic stress comes in. And it may be something that you don't even realize that you have it just might be.
14155.0,Patient,For.
706.0,Provider,"You started answering questions that it triggered to some some of those scores. Well don't even realize that they have it until they're triggered you know, sometimes it can be as simple as somebody like a car door slamming that can trigger people that have ptsd."
14155.0,Patient,I just depends on the.
706.0,Provider,"situation, and you know what they've been through. As well as how much have they already coped with it, how much have they talked through it, how much they worked through it and. So that's just the information you know that we have thus far. So let's go back and talk a little bit more um, what is your treatment history been like Have you ever had any Inpatient treatment."
14155.0,Patient,Inpatient treatment and.
706.0,Provider,"yeah so ation is when you are in the Community, you go see somebody but you've never been to like a hospital like Inpatient for mental health, where you had to stay extended period of time for treatment."
14155.0,Patient,Oh no no i've never been one of those.
706.0,Provider,Okay okay um What about suicidal ideations I do you have that's hurting yourself.
14155.0,Patient,"um no, I would say, the only time I really had a major issue with that was roughly a decade ago. Because it was a time in my life, where I was trying to figure out, who I was when I graduated high school has a. Time where I finally like admitted to myself that i'm gay and it's. You know. With all the negativity that surrounds that you know that was 12 years ago, so it. You know I would always make these fake scenario is up my head that everyone's gonna you know. Exit my life, you know advice even dare mention this, you know."
706.0,Provider,"So it was just that challenging portion of your life, where you were really confused that you felt like you might have had those thoughts, but you haven't had any of those thoughts since then."
14155.0,Patient,"Now. Okay well or is another minor one two years ago, where I was where my self confidence went down the aisle went down the tubes after a really, really bad day at work, I just wanted to I had like a thought in my head for about five to 10 seconds about. You know, driving my car or something. But it was like a very, very brief thought, but I haven't thought anything of that at all since then okay."
706.0,Provider,"So they're like fleeting thoughts they're not something that sticks around it's nothing that you make a plan for it's nothing that you. gather things to you know that you're going to make an attempt, or anything like that."
14155.0,Patient,i've never done that.
706.0,Provider,Well that's good What about homicidal ideation any of those thoughts towards hurting somebody else.
14155.0,Patient,um no okay.
706.0,Provider,Self injurious behaviors ever burning cutting anything like that.
14155.0,Patient,"There have been days, where I was frustrated where it's sometimes take you know I festive Bay my head a few times and I get really irritated with myself and things like that."
706.0,Provider,And when was the last time that you did that.
14155.0,Patient,A month ago me okay.
706.0,Provider,"And, did you say you were cutting yourself, or what were you doing."
14155.0,Patient,"I wasn't doing that, though I don't ever stop."
706.0,Provider,"Okay, so what was that self injurious behaviors it cut out, so I didn't hear it i'm sorry."
14155.0,Patient,"Oh, it was just you know, sometimes I take my face and Bangalore my head a couple times."
706.0,Provider,"Okay, so. Okay, so just hitting your hand okay."
14155.0,Patient,yeah.
706.0,Provider,And that's just when things become overwhelming is that.
14155.0,Patient,"yeah usually it's work related. i'll help when I and there's so much to do and I can't get it all done tonight just have that moment of low self confidence, where he's saying there's no way I can do this, and I just feel like that, at the time but that's the best solution is to just get ahead well. But it really isn't the answer but."
706.0,Provider,"And what does that what does that do for you, when you take your fists and hit your head."
14155.0,Patient,"Honestly, it doesn't. You repeat that i'm sorry I, like my mind just wait. wait for a second. So you're asking me when I hit my head, what does that do like."
706.0,Provider,What does it do like most people do things because they get a positive reaction from whatever they're doing.
14155.0,Patient,And so you know.
706.0,Provider,"Is that, just like a release of like negative energy, you know what makes you do that there's what's the reward and you know hitting your head."
14155.0,Patient,it's it's a release of negative energy okay okay.
706.0,Provider,um and when did you first get diagnosed with. Your co occurring mental illness.
14155.0,Patient,um. So say one more time i'm sorry.
706.0,Provider,"So when were you first diagnosed with your mental illness, you have you know, a couple of diagnosis."
14155.0,Patient,"It started the mood disorder was diagnosed roughly a year ago, and then the rest, the other ones were diagnosed i'd say a month or two ago okay."
706.0,Provider,So you didn't really have any diagnosis as a child or as a teenager anything like that these these came on in adulthood.
14155.0,Patient,"Correct the only one that I would say I don't know this was I don't believe this is an official diagnosis, because I honestly didn't ask my mother how just how much there was. There I did. But I do remember as a child has suffered a lot from asperger's syndrome, which I know that's on a different. A different. wavelength, I guess. You know because I knew as a kid I was, I was dealing with a lot of things that were under the autism umbrella, but as time went on, I noticed that those. didn't go away completely, but there are still a few things that you know. Are floating around in here."
706.0,Provider,"So, when you say the autism umbrella what exactly what were some of the things that they were saying we're meeting those specific benchmarks that made you have that diagnosis."
14155.0,Patient,"It was. Like taking interest in one specific thing and just studying every last you know possible engine corner of it, you know. which I still I believe I still deal with that, nowadays, you know. justin different. in a different way, I guess, like I would find very, very. odd things fascinating you know, like everyday items. You know. And just not being able to socialize well with other people my age group okay. You know, at that time."
706.0,Provider,"Any behaviors or anything that your parents reported that you had as a child, with it, because some of that bang of the head can be things because you, you know have on that spectrum somewhere, did you do, that is, that something you've just did as an adult."
14155.0,Patient,"To be honest, I can't remember as a kid I think the only time I did that was when I get really upset at myself for like losing a game video game, or something but besides that okay I can't think of anything okay."
706.0,Provider,"And we had to talk about your medications um What about family history, do you have a family history of mental health issues or substance use."
14155.0,Patient,"My mother's side definitely would count as that. My mom herself, she was you know she was you know good you know we never. She never really had substance abuse well, actually, let me rephrase that earlier on, as far as substance abuse goes it was fine, but I felt like it got worse as time went on it, which eventually led to a passing six years ago. But, like, I have a client who suffered from bipolar disorder. And an uncle both of my mom siblings I have an uncle who's been just. Like alcohol take over his life for basically the entire time that alive past 30 years. As far as the ancestors go and not really exactly sure what went on, but I know. You know the three of them were had have had issues at one point or another okay."
706.0,Provider,"And what was your mom's substance use issue with it, where she is saying."
14155.0,Patient,"It was. Well, this came about because she did not want to take you know strong medications. She always spoke against it when she was younger, but she had massive back pain. Now she didn't say herself, but she was addicted will probably want to admit it, but it was. Like really, really strong medicine that would help with her back pain, but it was stuff like you know opium and oh what what else was it um. i'm trying to think of the exact names of the medications but there's like oxy cotton and things like that that her doctors are prescribing her."
706.0,Provider,yeah she was on opiates basically.
14155.0,Patient,"yeah and I noticed over time, that she was talking about the medicine, more and more and more under the time so she'd be like just really like goofy and really just know and then other times like. This really freaked me out, you know, especially when you have two years of her death, where she sit on the couch and she was a smoker Susan sit on the couch smoking, he would just fall asleep with a cigarette in hand, you know, like you mean forward on a couch until. She finally got up and."
706.0,Provider,You know those those pain medications those opioids once when people take them they take them for the right reasons.
14155.0,Patient,You know there's been.
706.0,Provider,"But eventually what they do is your body forms a dependence on them and then instead of making the pain better your body creates what's called secondary pain, which makes your pain, even worse, which then has people take even more of what they're taking to make the pain go away. But it doesn't and then they just can be become more and more dependent, to the point where, if they stopped taking it, they would get physically at all um. And so I mean that's a pretty common story, you know, an injury, you know, leads to a substance use disorder, especially with opiates I mean that's a pretty pretty common story, unfortunately. So you said, your mom died a few years ago What did she die from."
14155.0,Patient,"I believe it was known as a pulmonary embolism she was at the issues in the hospital, I was, I was here in Michigan the whole time this is in Virginia and i'm. divorced right, I come from a divorced family, so I liver most my family lives sweet now anyway. I didn't hear anything. I don't hear any audio."
706.0,Provider,Can you hear me.
14155.0,Patient,yeah now I did.
706.0,Provider,"yeah I lost you for about 30 seconds you just kind of froze up I heard divorce and then that's, the only thing last thing I heard so."
14155.0,Patient,"yeah what I was saying was my parents are divorced my mom wasn't Virginia. Where I am now admission for everybody, basically, the rest of my family's at. Eight besides my stepdad Nice and sister who are still in Virginia, but. anyway. it's one of those things where it was happening before I moved here, which was a year and a half, prior to her death. It that that's one of the things that the more I think about it, the more maybe that contributes to this, you know ptsd diagnosis. Because. yeah it. was one of those things where I didn't want to admit something wrong was happening, but in reality, something was happening, but. I just wasn't believing it."
706.0,Provider,So um and you mentioned dad his dad side of the family have any history of mental health or substance use.
14155.0,Patient,"far as mental health or substance use goes I. I mean they're not like my direct on bill of the family, I would notice there's not much, I know, there was a little bit you know. Maybe a couple people here are there i'm both my grandma and grandpa side of my dad's family like you know, second, third cousins but Besides that, I don't really how. I see you know a lot of people with you know. My dad side know most them, you know have everything put together."
706.0,Provider,"um What about medical now, you said that your mom had a pulmonary embolism but has there been any other major medical on her side of the family or with you."
14155.0,Patient,"i'm. On both sides of the fence my moms and dads I do notice that there's quite a bit of an issue with diabetes okay i'm mainly Type two, I think. I can't think of a type one other than next under that other than like a third cousin but. I noticed a lot of adult onset diabetes, which is something i'm trying to look out for."
706.0,Provider,that's about the only major thing that you can think of. Do you have any medical issues.
14155.0,Patient,Medical besides ibs I. don't I can't think of anything else.
706.0,Provider,um How would you describe your relationship with your family.
14155.0,Patient,"i'd say it's really good Okay, you know, I have a. I have a sister. in Virginia right now cool i'm currently not in speak in terms of you know, with but. That will most likely eventually subside but. You know, we had an issue in a previous visit down there and I just haven't spoken to her sense okay. Just mainly making my fiance feel like absolute crap while we were down there and it was just not okay. No. You know I had i've had on and off, you know good and bad relationships with you know her and my other system my only full simply heather my sister here. we've had you know ups and downs what. Usually comes. To a point you'll have major ups and downs."
706.0,Provider,mm hmm.
14155.0,Patient,"My step mom is the only one, I can say I had like a really negative password she's with the way. And me well today she's a lot better than she was in my childhood I. was quite fearful for my step dad he went through but not I don't think it's bad, to a degree, my step dad proposed by step, parents would be very. could be quite scary to be alone at certain times I was slugger okay."
706.0,Provider,um. Where are you currently living.
14155.0,Patient,Currently i'm in my own apartment over and flat rock Michigan. You know i'm getting ready to move to another one in ypsilanti which is not too far from here. To be closer to work into my fiancee and just everyone else it's more centric. um yeah I live alone.
706.0,Provider,"And then, when you move will fiancee move in with you is that the plan."
14155.0,Patient,"um which ride to figure out a plan, but he's currently on. section eight and. I don't want to mess that up for them."
706.0,Provider,yeah that's they're really very there's a lot of guidelines that you have to follow and once you get off of that it's very difficult to get back on so you definitely want to be 100% sure.
14155.0,Patient,um make that move so yeah.
706.0,Provider,I would agree with that.
14155.0,Patient,"Okay, I was thinking of moving was that i'm sorry."
706.0,Provider,No go ahead.
14155.0,Patient,"Oh no I was saying, I was close to losing there but they had a thing, where they brought the price down for section eight requirements. And I forgot about that, and when I realized how much that was I, and I don't know if there's a way I can even afford that because he doesn't work right now he's just going to school and living off plants and. I did okay okay um. So yeah I don't want to get wall school that up oh."
706.0,Provider,"yeah no I can understand that I think that's just a conversation that will need to continue to be had to figure out what is going to be the you know the most optimal situation for you both. Well, you know, while you build your future so yeah I mean that makes sense. So. You had mentioned childhood trauma where you."
14155.0,Patient,do have a like sexual abuse physical abuse.
706.0,Provider,verbal abuse.
14155.0,Patient,"There was some physical, but it was enough to make me feel. You know scarred it enough to. As I grew older like it just something like it, though, it would still feel the negative energy from that time period so now, I can still feel that energy and i've inserted, but like when I go to my dad's house they live in the same House number my dad and stepmom what. You know I go there okay go to certain rooms of the House and all just like flashback to you know."
706.0,Provider,"Okay, and. The physical abuse with them with did from your mom."
14155.0,Patient,"The physical yeah it was. Some of it, I don't even remember, but my older sister remembers it and I have an aunt who remembers it to. know one time, I was dropped off my grandma's house and. Either I had a black either a giant bruise on my arm or something by it was not happy about it wanted to get down to. get down to it, and figure out who. Who did it and how it happened and. which I have no memory that, but it must have been so. So jarring and I must have just. That my brain must have just. Basically, wiped it out or or hit it in a vault in there, somewhere, I don't know but yeah."
706.0,Provider,"Did you find when you were growing up, you know as you got older that you have like a startle reflex."
14155.0,Patient,A startled like.
706.0,Provider,"Like a startle reflex like some people who have been physically abused in their childhood. When people like really quickly um you know, like a quick movement, a lot of times, people will have a startle reflex like go to protect themselves."
14155.0,Patient,"I really noticed that all that much, but I think I do know what you're saying I might have done it but. Like look behind my back to make sure nothing there things like that."
706.0,Provider,"You know, things like that, but even something as simple as you know, you could be standing there somebody reaches like in front of you to like get something off of the counter but you see that arm coming and you just kind of like you kind of like protect yourself it's like. A lot of times it's it's when you're younger. You just kind of have that weird that weird feeling again that feeling of there's you know, an arm coming at me, I have to protect myself that kind of thing. A lot of times as adults either over that, but a lot of times as children you do exhibit that that's one of the actual signs of some a child that's been physically abused as that startle reflex. So, and you may have had it as a child and that remember to. So so but no sexual abuse, no verbal abuse just mainly physical."
14155.0,Patient,"There is verbal. Like when I did something that was wrong my step mom would go to my dad and. Basically, try to make me look and sound and basically feel stupid."
706.0,Provider,And so what about your dad like What did he think about all of these behaviors that step mom was doing.
14155.0,Patient,"See the thing with him is. I think he's financially comfortable living with her. and I think he was honestly afraid to do anything about it, like. As much as I wish, he would have, which is another thing, while we're there notice. And there's a couple times, where we stood up and she basically wanted. She would basically kick us out of the House."
706.0,Provider,Okay.
14155.0,Patient,So she.
706.0,Provider,yeah she definitely had something to hold over top of his head so she was very much in control. yeah okay um What about with mom and stepdad did you have any of those experiences with them.
14155.0,Patient,"It over there, it was different like. At my dad's house high expectations like no good Great Wall mean good grades from both places, but my dad's it was more or less like we always have to go out and do stuff you know got it, you know they busy, and you know. Basically. Just. yeah like always find it is to do, whereas in my mom's place it was more laid back you don't want to. spend the whole day sitting inside, you know cool like see you do more, but that's what you want to do that's cool too, you know it was morally back over there for sure, but you know my step that will get. physically abusive, but I think with them, he was so stressed out at work, you know. I read alone and. You would get. upset at all, but as time went on, I actually developed a pretty close relationship after my mom passed."
706.0,Provider,and
14155.0,Patient,What about what happened.
706.0,Provider,You mentioned school grade school and grades What was your school experience.
14155.0,Patient,"school. Was um. let's see. They were up and down like i'd have some classes, where I see a little above average maybe overall. Like I wasn't a great a student and I wasn't like a total failure student like i'd say, is it may be slightly above average. You know. Certain classes, I do a lot better than others, basically."
706.0,Provider,"Okay, and was that your pattern through elementary school middle school high school."
14155.0,Patient,yeah.
706.0,Provider,"Okay, what about peers, did you have were you able to make friends did you have healthy peer relationship."
14155.0,Patient,"Or, as peers are concerned, I was very quiet as I am still even now, but back then, it was. I had my little set of friends, and that was so fun I stopped. For most my life. or school i'd rather."
706.0,Provider,"um when you were done with high school, did you go on to school."
14155.0,Patient,"No, even the place it's a thought that still comes up every now and again."

Supply uniforms to come, you know for rental purposes. Like linens format cleaning products things like that. So i'm one of the I started off doing. loading and unloading for the trucks and now I have my own route. So I go to all these places pick up the dirty and leave them cleans. And I keep track of the accounts and after contracts are up by. You know, see if they want to renew service. With us for another. longer period of time."
706.0,Provider,And how long have you been doing that.

706.0,Provider,"you've done quite a bit. If you would go back to school, what would you go back for."
14155.0,Patient,"That is the thing that. is hard to determine, because the main thing I wanted to do when I was younger was do something that involves the radio, but the radio industry is so unpredictable now. That I don't know if they want to do it if I I would the thing I would love to record shop, because I am so into music and mm hmm records and things like that would be an absolute dream job but it's such a risk see that."
706.0,Provider,It is because it's so specific. um. I mean those are good goals to have and maybe it'll be able to find something that you can work towards. At least incorporate of this.
14155.0,Patient,So. That would be.
706.0,Provider,"I mean that would be the most ideal situation is that maybe you don't get exactly what you want, for a profession, but you can incorporate pieces of those things that you love. You know that's the everybody's goal is maybe you don't get exactly what you want, but there's certain pieces of your job that you just really love and and that's what keeps you going."

14155.0,Patient,"Both of us have decided no on that. I just yeah it's it's a lot. And I think like with how stressed, I am that was."
706.0,Provider,kids take you to a whole different level.
14155.0,Patient,"nieces and nephews, though."
706.0,Provider,"You can give them back you get to spoil them and then give them back. When they're your. Take them home. So I have a two and a half, almost three year old and I have a 13 year old and it's interesting day to day at my house. But so um. So a relationship that you have with him healthy strong going in the right direction, no, no major complaints early. And it's just going to be you and him together and then whatever pets you guys acquire. will be handed your your pet children."
14155.0,Patient,"yep i'm mainly cats, we have the possibility of a dog but. wait till we're like in the same House together to have a dog because."
706.0,Provider,My work.
14155.0,Patient,Right living they allow dogs but How often have we can play yeah.
706.0,Provider,"they're a lot more work you just can't leave them on their own, and they do their own thing like cats they definitely need a lot more attention um we have two cats and we have one dog and the dog definitely takes up more time than the cats do."
14155.0,Patient,Right so.
706.0,Provider,um What about your stress level from day to day how How would you rank that.
14155.0,Patient,"Stress level would just depend on the amount of workload that I have like. i'm there are days I get to a certain point that I realized just stops I have left and it's just like oh my gosh I am not going to solve these to push them to tomorrow. it's a blessing that's who have one delivery days around the area. To bring to that to that are thankfully not crazy far apart far enough to make it. Like, for instance, my Thursday is, I fear stressful and it'll be one o'clock in the afternoon and I realize, I still have like 18 stops to go oh shoot that's a bad, but still. You know a lot of them are smaller but it's, just like the number like em this many I realized that it's like oh my gosh you know."
706.0,Provider,I felt overwhelming feeling that you get.
14155.0,Patient,"yeah, especially when I started six that I don't get back to play at school six."
706.0,Provider,So you start when it's dark and when it's dark that really makes you feel like it's an extremely long day so in the summer it's not as bad because at least it's laid out when you get home.
14155.0,Patient,But when you start.
706.0,Provider,"it's a fall months, you know when it gets darker than you if you feel like you've been working a lot longer yeah. A lot of people also develop you know what they call seasonal depression, because of those weather changes and and the lack of vitamin D you get because the sun goes down quicker things like that. So those can all add to that um so it sounds like your biggest stressor at this point in time is work and. The expectations of work and. The things that come up at work, those seems to really kind of. send your stress levels, you know to a different height than just a normal stress level."
14155.0,Patient,Correct yeah.
706.0,Provider,Anything else that you would click on that major stressor list.
14155.0,Patient,Well before I get to say the ever since I started the lexapro it has really helped me with not. Stressing and much.
706.0,Provider,How I.
14155.0,Patient,"find my concentration going more towards the things that really. You know, like making sure that. You know the. More important tasks are always done. Oh shoot I hope I didn't lose yeah. Oh yeah."
706.0,Provider,"You just froze up for a minute, so you were talking about your Program."
14155.0,Patient,"Right yeah since I started on a lexapro i've noticed an improvement. i'm finding myself focusing a lot more on things that actually matter. Like if I forget the teeny tiny little thing that the real my whole day like starting to that. it's not taking Center stage and once but. If something happens where I could drive all the way back to that point but that's something that that's gonna that's what we'll do me a whole day. that's an hour. You know. When you count traveling both way that that's a half hour each way, what is the next plan."
706.0,Provider,"Okay, so. Those are your major stressors and the only thing that I can tell you. Is the circles of control, you know you look at what you wrote what you can't and that's really how you can cope with those stressors these you put them in each category and the things you can't control Those are the things you just wanted to cope with."
14155.0,Patient,The audio is going out. And just. The audio went out for about. 40 seconds there.
706.0,Provider,"Okay, so say that the the lexapro because it's going to kind of stabilize you a little bit more into it has. caused you to be able to process things a little bit easier, rather than. go from you know go to worst case scenario, you know, like what you had been doing in the past, like nitpicking everything and then going to worst case scenario. This is going to you know with the the anxiety being less you can take a deep breath think okay well. This is what I can control in this situation, this is what I can't so the things I can control are these, so this is my plan the things over here that I can't control, this is my plan of how i'm going to react to that so. You know you control the fact that you have to go back. But you can control of how you're going to react to that or even how to prevent that in the future, you know, come up with a plan to prevent that from happening. So just. Like that can be really helpful. And then. How would you say at this point in time, your self esteem as."
14155.0,Patient,"i've noticed is getting better used to be, you know a lot worse. But, especially in the last year, and so, even with this crazy crap happening in the world i've for me at least me as a person i've been noticing a lot of. My my goal was the new decade, I mean just paint a whole new picture. rip the bold wallpaper off the wall just painted right back up the scratching my face here that's what. My plan was in there, there are challenges, I still face on a day to day to day basis but i'm doing more things now to make me a better person and. Progress more i'd like to spend family work sleep and that's it, you know."
706.0,Provider,So um we're done with your bps did you have any do you have any questions for me.
14155.0,Patient,"Well, there was one more thing I wanted to mention about like stress like things that that wasn't the one question. I can be a bit of a hypochondriac sometimes. And my fiance deals a lot of health issues and, as of late i've noticed it's gotten better, but like he has type one diabetes and he's. Having a lot of heart it. has been having heart issues to with very high heart yc and coaching is hard sometimes. Even though his doctors not saying get surgery done immediately. It was still giving me those just. was like oh my gosh you know that's where it comes to control how you control situation."
706.0,Provider,yeah and have you noticed those racing thoughts lessening since you started your lexapro.
14155.0,Patient,"Actually, yes okay good good."
706.0,Provider,Then it's doing what it's supposed to so that's good. um do you have any questions for me I.
14155.0,Patient,don't. Think all the bases covered.
706.0,Provider,"So um. There was a suicide risk that was on your profile that after evaluating you I don't feel like as necessary. sounds like it's been years and years and years and years, and you haven't had you know any very any recent thoughts, even of harming yourself. So I went ahead and remove that. But I will check in periodically from time to time, just to see you know how you're doing with that. Just because there is but it's long time in your past, but you know just to check in it's just a safety thing. So what are the some of that like protective factors in your life so when things are going, like really chaotic, what do you feel like stops you from kind of going off the edge."
14155.0,Patient,"um. Honestly, I just. me and my fiance talk on the phone and even that alone, with this being with him in person, it helps a lot, you know and company and friends needed, you know I get to a couple favorite TV shows for a while okay. yeah."
706.0,Provider,"No, no, absolutely and we talked about the major stressors that kind of get you to that point, you know as far as work. And just racing thoughts of worrying about your fiance um you know just having to figure out the things you can control and the things you can't and how to process that so. I think you know, I think that you definitely have a good grasp and insight on on what your issues are and kind of what you want to work on and and. What you want to move towards, so I think that's really great um So if you don't have any more questions, and you know we can be done for the day."
14155.0,Patient,yeah I think we're okay.
706.0,Provider,"sounds good, well, it was really nice to meet you travis."
14155.0,Patient,You as well Stacy Thank you so much.
