Times finally come to where i'm moving out of the rv with my expert or. yeah and so i'm I am my when a friend of mine has a little forever and so i'm going to go right from her. But it's just it's also. stressful because I don't have a car, yet, and I have savings and stuff but you know it takes time to find something good and it doesn't feel like I have a lot of freedom yeah and just getting use all these transitions and."
760.0,Provider,"You don't have a lot of freedom you mean because of the lack of transportation, the car and you're kind of used to being kind of living a life and. driving around and so that feels."
14845.0,Patient,"Strange yeah. yeah it's the but it feels weird to not just be able to hop in my car and go over that one. yeah yeah yes it's just a new city that I don't know. That can always be scary, especially with like cities going to one extremely expensive for everything. yeah for to sometimes dangerous if you don't if you go out alone or things like that. And normally I won't play like things like that, but. Like a year and a half ago, I had an experience with someone like I found out later that they were like drugging me. And he could be actually accidentally killed a girl like right after me, so I just kind of feel like different now."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so this is a previous boyfriend the one that you had before, the one that you're now splitting from."
14845.0,Patient,"yeah yeah we had only been dating for like a month or two, but like i'd go over this House like three days a week for four days, and we can see over yeah like it yeah."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so So where is it that you're moving."

14845.0,Patient,yeah.
760.0,Provider,Do you have a lot of stuff to transport them.
14845.0,Patient,"I pretty much got rid of most of my possessions, when I moved in the rv. So. it's not really. No, not really but there's a bed and a dresser so we sit on the fire. yeah. But, and I, so I I found a gig like a week, though, and so. Well, so. So I was thinking, maybe everything's been pretty ambiguous. I thought that I was supposed to move out kind of like in the beginning of November."
760.0,Provider,And then.
14845.0,Patient,"He just kept inviting me to do things with them and then. got back from what we were doing it kind of all. fell, at the same time and it's like okay yeah so my next sick, you know however many weeks are playing site you're not involved in and i'm like oh Okay, I guess, this happening, then so it just it just felt like. You know something that we've been talking about for a long time yeah and he's been pretty consistent with it, but then. You know, invited me to a bunch of other things beyond point where we're supposed to be spreading I wasn't exactly sure where he was on."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, and you just kind of let them dictate the when you didn't feel the need to go earlier. Or maybe there was a part of you that was hoping that there wouldn't be a breakup is that what what's your feeling."
14845.0,Patient,"yeah part of me was reading it be and seeing if maybe he would you just mind. has not changed this might. not see a party is kind of hoping that things will change but communication with him has been hard he doesn't really share his feelings lot. yeah I try to fight so make sure that we have time to talk about things and plan my future out and he'll say yeah yeah okay i'll put on my calendar and then. there's always an excuse Oh well, I have this other thing I have to do, or whatever it is, so I just kept kind of being put on the back burner, and then I felt like oh my God, I need I need to build an entire life and like one day."
760.0,Provider,Okay.
14845.0,Patient,"yeah so it was really ambiguous i'm like well I don't know, maybe we'll spend some time with my mom we will spend some time with my acquire family my chosen family. And I did that, but you know how family is like you love. them drive you crazy."
760.0,Provider,You mean you referring to your mother. and Andrew acquired family do. yeah okay.
14845.0,Patient,"Like my family is awesome and really loving and supportive and great, but like high pressure like she always pushing me to do what she wants. And she doesn't like have scheduled for the kids and so it's just chaotic. Right so something happened, I went over to my mom's house and we were having a great time and everything we you know we were you're drinking and she had her roommate and one of her coworkers over and. She like just started doing what she always does, when she drinks to this point, and she like got blackout drunk and violent and. I is very triggering for me, and so I like Ryan like she was kind of like coming after me and the guys were like holding her back and like trying to like restrain her. And so I just ran out of the apartment screaming at the top of my lungs beyond I thought that she's going to come to chase me down and. So I shade underneath a cop car. It was just an apartment complex, so there wasn't like a coffee or anything I just felt like the safest option."
760.0,Provider,"Okay. So you you've had a difficult experience that's a very traumatic experience I don't see how spending time with mom is. A good option for you as your safety, you know you have you have physical safety and also your emotional safety. Do you do you, what do you think about only being around your mother if she's not drinking."
14845.0,Patient,"yeah so I i've tried to set some boundaries like that, last time I went to go visit her I said, like. You know if I come visit us, I see the night, I want to make sure, like, I have a room where I can lock the door, I want to make sure that, like you know if you decide to drink it's not more than like three and she just kind of like. rolled. and"
760.0,Provider,"rolled her eyes. he's happy, she said."
14845.0,Patient,"I mean, so it was it was kind of over text message, but that was that's the tone on that yeah whatever you will see, and then she just did whatever she wanted anyway, and so. At this point, like I should know better and it's my fault for putting myself in that situation again and again and again and. I even though i'm telling her my boundaries and she's not listening to it, I have to enforce it just so I sent her a text message and it's like I love you and I had a wonderful time with you okay so vm and then i'm. not acceptable and my boundaries with you are going to be that i'm never going to sleep on the same reference you and we're never going to drink together because we can't. And i'm doing i'm in a forcing these boundaries, because I love you and because I want to have a relationship with you."
760.0,Provider,"And what kind of response, did you get back."
14845.0,Patient,That my tone was condescending and how I always blame her for everything and I don't accept. How is just very angry and. yeah.
760.0,Provider,"So you're feeling a lot of pressure it doesn't really sound like staying with your mother is an option right now. In your House. House how soon, are you going to need to when does when does your. Your your ex boyfriend tell you. That you need to move out by."
14845.0,Patient,"um he, like he didn't give me like a time that I need to identify. Do you think he's just going to pull the rug and say today's the day, you have to go or. No. No okay now he's been super like supportive vacation when it comes back and. He wants to make sure that I am but he's setting up for success. is getting know subtle it's good for. You just optimists."
760.0,Provider,Okay.
14845.0,Patient,"yeah but um there is something that he wants to take the rv to on the 28th of December, so the move in date for my girlfriend's room is. The 15th, so I think i'm just going to. move in on the 30th because. I just kind of want to like move forward in my life."
760.0,Provider,"yeah I think I think. yeah. Be being proactive is probably going to feel better, more secure than just kind of waiting for that for him to just kind of, say, this is it. So you're you're you're going to be it looks like you're going through a bit of a grieving process. you're familiar with what that means right the stages of grief we've talked about that did we talked about that last time."
14845.0,Patient,"I don't know if we talked about it, but I believe it's denial anger bargaining acceptance."
760.0,Provider,and depression.
14845.0,Patient,Depression.
760.0,Provider,"yeah like. yeah feeling feeling depressed feeling down loss, you know mourning the loss. So to where you think you're at right now."
14845.0,Patient,"i'm I feel like over the past several months i've asked me. In the beginning, something denial and then. Anger comes and goes. Depending kind of on what i'm telling myself like sometimes i'm like well you know i'm grateful for all the amazing experiences i've got to do. recall that I had a relationship that was pretty healthy and taught me the way that I deserve to be treated. But then Sometimes I get angry because it's like. I gave 110% I was, I was always trying to. Like work on our problems and make it better and I wasn't even given the time of day, so there are a lot of broken agreements you McCain to making sure that my needs are met and. it's extremely hard. So. So the depression part. A little bit of bargaining. Yes. Okay."
760.0,Provider,"All right. All right, there's more to it to you, you had this dream. This this. Life. You know, a life of freedom. Going and seeing the things you want to see so it's it's."
14845.0,Patient,Just.
760.0,Provider,"I kind of wonder if there's more to it than just the loss of the relationship that maybe the loss of the whole lifestyle and you know. That it's in the freedom yeah so it's probably both and you're going to not and you know struggling without having the car, but you know those things can little bit a little by little, be improved. So, you said you have a gig. What do you mean."
14845.0,Patient,"um so as soon as I came to Miami I got a gig assisting. A good start boost for like 2020 bucks an hour. yeah, but that was only for the art massive weekends and then. And now I have another job but it's a terrible job I guess because. Basically, for $2,000 a month, we have to be at someone's beck and call. My within with very little notice and. We have to. let's say the project and, like oh so it's basically unlimited amount of hours, so it might be like two weeks, where we don't it's working on a on a year so just like serving drinks and cleaning."
760.0,Provider,A plane okay.
14845.0,Patient,"So normally people will get paid like $30 an hour plus tips, but I didn't know that this was just like a salary position and it was like okay you don't really have the option to say no, you don't want to take it on. You also he can work five days a week, if he wants to."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so $2,000 a month and that's okay. Okay."
14845.0,Patient,But I haven't interview with a charter company that would pay me on one.
760.0,Provider,"yeah it's probably be able to find something much better than that, so it, you know just thinking terms that you're going from you're taking what you got to take the to to to be okay, and then you just keep going until you find something that that's better for you. yeah so so your mother is where it's a year now in Miami is that way. You guys are with your camper in Miami. Okay, and. Okay, and where's your mother look."
14845.0,Patient,she's a new smyrna beach. This.
760.0,Provider,Is that in Florida too.
14845.0,Patient,yeah it's like it's on the west coast halfway up.
760.0,Provider,"on the west coast okay so she's a she's a long distance from you. you're going to be away from her for a while, if you stay in Miami."
14845.0,Patient,"it's three and a half hours if I get if I get a car, I can go visit her anytime I want, but with the way that she is like I said it's so hard to try to like maintain a relationship with her. Because he's to be very toxic. doesn't respect boundaries. i'll be like don't like don't touch me you're you're being aggressive you're getting drunk I don't like the way you're touching me and she doesn't care and like like like part of the reason why she got so mad at me was because for co worker who was over. She wanted us to sleep in the bed together because he was drunk and because you don't want him to drive home so she was like you me and him we'll all sleep in the bed together and then like. And then it'll be fine and i'm like no I don't want to do that, like we've all been drinking, I met this guy like three hours ago, and he was flirting with me and i'd like disrespectful way which my mom didn't know about. But like just like Why do I have to like, why do you feel like you have control over me and if I say no, you have a right to it like fucking. loser shit on me. You know."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, and I think you told me last time, your mother does does she have a drinking problem, she has a drinking club, how long has she had a drinking problem."
14845.0,Patient,As long as I can remember.
760.0,Provider,Your childhood.
14845.0,Patient,"yeah I mean it used to be like she would just party, but you know there were times when. I would wake her up and she'd be passed out on the floor in the living room she wouldn't wake up and running, I mean, so I don't really know how bad it was known as a kid but apparently after she had miscarriages she that works okay yeah okay."
760.0,Provider,"All right, um. So talk to me talk to me about. Your your problems with relationships, he said that the, the one that you're breaking up with now he's is he one of the only guys that you think was a more healthy relationship that you've been in or what is your habit with. Men because. You said you, you were with somebody who. Drug you think drug you and somebody after you so. There was a."
14845.0,Patient,"Late friend showed me the police report she accidentally killed a girl, and they found drugs in her body, and she had videos on his laptop and having sex with girls that were passed out. yeah."
760.0,Provider,Do you think that happened to you.
14845.0,Patient,"yeah at one time I caught him like with his laptop open and I was like what are you doing so yeah. But, so I went through that not too long before I started this relationship and. I don't know if I fully process that. And so I just feel like I used to be extremely trusting and now I with how many times i've been taken advantage of or hurts just emotionally from the loss of the relationship I just feel like I don't want a closer anyone like romantically for a very long. And are gorgeous I mean I want that romantic love in my life, but I need to heal. And and yeah and I need to focus on myself. And I don't want to be attached i'm scared of how easy it is to get attached to someone."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, and then, if you sometimes we have a tendency to see what we want to see in relationships and sometimes we don't see. The way this person really is. And and. So yeah I think working on your. Mental health. and getting to a certain level of healing and a certain level of recovery is going to be really positive for you and then. When you're ready much you know down the road when you're much better, that would be a good, then you can be open to just letting things happen, but you know. You know relationships, do you feel like you need to be with a guy in order to feel Okay, do you think there's some part of you that's like that or or do you think you feel. Or you don't feel that way you feel confident in yourself without with or without a guy."
14845.0,Patient,"I feel like I believe in myself, and I feel confident myself, and I feel like I love myself."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, good."
14845.0,Patient,"But I feel like that's independent of having a desire for intimacy and in a family. I don't really have. A family that is like meeting my needs. I it's hard for me to even talk to my mom sometimes. You know even spend time with her um same thing with my dad it's really difficult I don't have any siblings So when I lose some romantic relationship i'm losing my. kind of like the Center of my universe, and that is like not fair because one person should have all that pressure on them, but I just feel like i'm. Like like super alone. Like my needs are being met when when i'm just by myself and I like I like alone time I like being introverted but nothing happens to me when i'm like left in an empty House by myself, with no pets and I know roommates and that's like that I just it depresses me. and"
760.0,Provider,"So is that mean for a short period of time, you get left or do you mean just like long term I get left."
14845.0,Patient,"I mean like when I was living with roommates I enjoyed having alone time in House a little bit so like time isn't that bad, but it's just like if I come home to an empty House every single day with love inside of it like. sucks."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, but you're going to be you're going to a place you're planning to rent this room so you're going to have one roommate."
14845.0,Patient,"um well it's her and her husband and then I think, maybe one or two other roommates okay."
760.0,Provider,So it's going to be kind of a full House and do you know these people that you're going to be living with it. didn't do you think that they're they're good people they're not gonna they're not yeah type people that are going to cause anxiety stress anything like that.
14845.0,Patient,"No, so we parked the rv in their yard on for about two months last summer."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so you know."
14845.0,Patient,yeah and she's very positive very sweet. A good friend and she has her life together like with her career finances and stuff like that.
760.0,Provider,"Okay okay. All right, so have you. Have you ever considered go there's a there's a group it's a 12 step group for. What we call adult children of alcoholics. i'm you know you say that you can't rely on your mother. your mother is a from what you're telling me she she sounds like a she has a substance use disorder. And so, people who have a substance use disorder they they think differently than the rest of us and you know, and when we're raised in an environment like that it, it creates like an effect on us. And and. So does that sound, you know so have you heard of a CA before adult children of alcoholics have you heard of it."
14845.0,Patient,I think you were telling me about program last time but.
760.0,Provider,Our island on. yeah.
14845.0,Patient,"Okay, but I thought it would have thought it started with an s or something."
760.0,Provider,"Oh yeah That was something that was material, we were going to go over, we can do that too, but um you know part of finding yourself you're telling me your mother has a drinking problem, and then there was an incident that happened that incident that happened with your mother happened. Since our last session right. yeah okay so i'm just throwing that as a as a suggestion. it's a it's basically it's a support system where you'll go and you'll learn about addiction and how that impacts, because when a person gets addicted to a substance say alcohol in your mother's case. Her whole life starts to all revolve around the alcohol and it's you know, through the addiction process it starts to change the way her brain functions and choices, she makes the way she used the world. And you know. As long as she's going to continue drinking it's. it's not going to be a healthy relationship for you you'll have to kind of put serious boundaries with her."
14845.0,Patient,"What do you, what do you do when they don't respect."
760.0,Provider,"Well, if somebody is drinking. when somebody drinks, that means that they. are literally. Okay, can you hear me now. Can you hear me."
14845.0,Patient,"I. can hear you, but the videos so frozen. Okay okay yeah."
760.0,Provider,OK.
14845.0,Patient,I can hear you.
760.0,Provider,"Alright, so what. What happens is. Again substance kind of still i'm sitting at a desk maybe, can you hear me. thumbs up. Can you hear me, can you hear me. Can you hear me okay good all right. When some stuff someone gets addicted and they're drinking it's. it's a downward process so that means that the problems with the addiction, are going to continue to get worse relationship problems could be. Sometimes people can have an addiction and they can still call function, they they can still go to work, they can still do some of the basic things but, most people over time that starts to fall away. And, and when when your mother's drinking what what happens what you know it's it's in the DSM with all the other mental health conditions that people can suffer from what happens is that when somebody is under the influence of alcohol or other drugs. The the frontal cortex the front part of the brain the reasoning part of the brain basically. It gets affected and much of it goes dark and so. They can't really think or process or make decisions well. Did I lose you Malaya. Hello."
14845.0,Patient,hi.
760.0,Provider,I there we go. I don't know how much of that you've heard. Did you hear all of it or just some of it.
14845.0,Patient,Just some of it.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so what I was saying that when somebody is under the influence and they have a drug problem or the substance problem. The the area of the body that gets affected initially is the frontal cortex of the brain the reasoning section, and so they can't make reasonable choices and so that you know the minute you described how she wanted you to. sleep with a strange man in bed she's not reasoning, the danger of that. So you know the really the only boundary that you have Malaya is. Is the one you kind of already laid out like i'm not going to be around you you're drinking. Because that that's really all you have you can't she's not seeing it. and her life is starting to revolve around alcohol so it's going to be important for you to kind of find yourself and to build a support system. or continue to build a support system outside of your family because it's you know you said you just don't have a family, you said that they're they're not supportive your father or your mother so that's why I was suggesting. Adult children above pollock or Al anon is a support system. And it's it's you know you it's it's a place to go where you will hear shared experiences other people who struggled with. family members who were alcoholics and maybe addicts the struggles, they went through but it's it's not a program that's supposed to help your mother it's a program that helps you process your own. Feelings because I like to say that when when somebody when somebody is born into a household where one or both parents has a substance abuse problem. That that parents their whole life is revolving around that substance, because they don't know how to be how to cope, how to do any how to live without that substance and so indirectly. Even though you may not have a substance problem but indirectly because of your mother and because of her choice to live that way or her way of being that now becomes your experience. And you're struggling with that. And then there are. There you know I know you said you're an only child, but just so little bit of education for you, there are different roles that adult children of alcoholics typically take on. Because everybody's trying to make the family system normal in and it's really not it's really abnormal and so people. In or they you know we don't have control over month, so we start to look at ourselves what can we, what can I do to control and so people can sometimes they. Try to sometimes they enable sometimes they try, let me take care of mom let me, let me help her, and you know i'll help her stop drinking i'll help her to this i'll clean up after her after she you know, maybe cover her when she when she's too drunk can't get up those kinds of things. Then there's the other role that adults for them up a holic often struggle with there's a mascot that's that's the person who wants to make jokes and is always being funny to try to lighten the mood of the pain that's caused when when when this is going on, then there's the. The hero. Which is you know somebody who's trying to fix everybody trying to take trying to fix the problem then. there's the scapegoat and the scapegoat is trying to deflect from the real problem of substance use that's going on by the parents, so they kind of act out and they take a lot of the plane in the family. And then the last one is last child last child is the one that just kind of hides away and tries to disappear in the corner and not be seen, because they don't want to get caught up in. what's going on. Now, sometimes people can take on more than one role in those and and sometimes that can change I don't know if you relate to that I know it changes, if you would have siblings you probably would have had some of that, but do you relate to any of those."
14845.0,Patient,"um well I basically was like. screw this i'm out of here, and so I try to get the job as early as possible, so this. 15 at the time and normally I wouldn't be able to. wouldn't be able to get a job, but I went through a special program at my school and they made an exception for me. So I was just trying to like get my independence as possible so that I could move out. Of that I moved in with my dad who also has. The substance abuse problem. Okay, and so um basically I was just trying to escape her and not get beaten every day. And was initially like very angry with her and. For just doing that to me and then. I kind of tried to help take care of my dad because he wasn't good with money, and we always like always there was always something wrong with the bills and. He didn't know how to cook so I just I took on the responsibility of doing all the grocery shopping and all the cooking and driving myself."
760.0,Provider,"That was the hero role, taking care of everything."
14845.0,Patient,yeah um you know for for myself and for my dad. And yeah. And then for my mom was just kind of like screw you.
760.0,Provider,"Was she was attacking you yeah so. So this is something that's been on for many years, I think. You know it's going to be really important for you to minimize contact with her, I don't know you know, for you to drive from Miami all the way across the country to the west coast to to. You know, to interact with somebody that she drinks that you're going to be opening this door, so you know. it's going to be really important to you that that not stay with her not stayed and the boundaries that you laid out for her were great. And I know that might be painful for you to maybe there's a part of you that wants to have a better relationship with with her and with your father too. yeah that part of what you're."
14845.0,Patient,"I absolutely wish I could be better I am I just feel like a lot of resentment and. and You know i'm kind of moving past the point of anger, with my mom because, like she. also do a lot of really difficult things and i'm just i'm just sick of being angry with her like they say that when you get older you move towards a place of compassion for them and what they they went through, but the same time, like I hold her accountable for her her choices. Because even though she was abused, I was abused and i'm not and i'm not an user because that was my choice, yes that's right."
760.0,Provider,"But but you're not say in her presence I. mean forgiveness, does not mean forgiveness, does not mean that you endanger yourself, or that you can don't bad behavior you can understand, but. setting boundaries with her is like super important I you know, and you can hope for the best. You can hope that you know she'll find recovery, but you know that's outside of your choice you know that's that's her choice to do or not, I can tell you that you know. You know. In keeping yourself safe is the most important. yeah and and make and let her. When people struggle with addiction, they they if we try to enable or we tried to rescue or we try to fix then that doesn't really work because that just kind of prolongs the. The ability for them to continue to use that substance without paying the price for using that substance and so. when somebody has a substance use disorder, they need to pay the you know the best chance that you have the only control, you have is to make her pay the price at least when it comes to the relationship with you. And that's the boundary that i'm talking about. And so I think Al anon would be good for you, because I think it would give you the support. You would have the opportunity of meeting people that are like you, that are struggling and you may be able to develop. connection and support. and give you that so that you don't feel so needy for that either with either with your mom and put it in putting yourself in danger or with the wrong guy to or just any guy because maybe you know, sometimes when we're wounded when we're hurt we're just not ready for relationship. Because we have to be. We have to be okay. Before I can show up and be a good partner to somebody. right that makes that makes sense."
14845.0,Patient,So yeah.
760.0,Provider,"nothing to do with the guy I mean you, you say you have an you had a good relationship with your your ex boyfriend that you're there in the camper with now, but maybe it maybe it's not him, maybe, maybe it's just timing, the healing is not there yet. yeah makes sense. yeah so I really would suggest you look up. Adult child I don't know if you're open to that, but I i'm I would ask you to at least think about it. Because it's it's a place to go to to learn about that and to find support."
14845.0,Patient,"i'm open to it i'll go check it out and see how I feel about it. Okay um. The other thing I was going to say. um I don't know I just I just feel like sometimes my anxiety gets so out of hand, like like to the point where it's a panic attack. Like last night. I think it was just kind of shooting me that how final everything is and how my partner's going to be gone or my ex partners and be gone for like five days, and that was kind of like my last time hanging out with them to see him. The separation anxiety was just overwhelming and like I started getting really Lucy like really dizzy. My my parents and my feet started tumbling and. So I try to calm myself down a little bit and because what's happened before, is that my hands will seize up and they'll get like like like this, you know, and I think we'll move them it's, just like the muscles that consistency."
760.0,Provider,Have you seen a doctor about that. Hold after.
14845.0,Patient,No.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, I think you need to see a medical doctor about that."
14845.0,Patient,Okay.
760.0,Provider,I mean so you're you're So do you think your anxiety is increased since our last session or or is it about the same How would you characterize it.
14845.0,Patient,"yeah i'd say it's definitely increased. Okay, a lot."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so do you think that it's because maybe. your sense of family has been tied with this with this person. And that is."
14845.0,Patient,"That we were we were talking about getting married and having kids. And like. Just how we would do it like what our plan was how we, you know the seasonal instead of traveling as much as we are now and I knew his whole family and his nieces and got attached to them and. You know it's it's really tempting to when your family sucks seek out a partner who has a good stable, loving family that you can kind of be adopted into. and So when I lose that romantic partner, I feel like i'm losing my whole new family. You know, parents and sister in law. kids and I feel like i'm losing. My whole future with having my own children and having a husband's rest of my life and and even to a certain degree, my my parents, because, like I go for men that are older than me who know better than I do, who can help give me guidance and kind of a supportive in that way. Because your."
760.0,Provider,eyes your ears your former partner also older than you.
14845.0,Patient,So my former my former partner than breaking up with right now he's 15 years older.
760.0,Provider,Okay.
14845.0,Patient,"And before that was like. 10 years old, or something."
760.0,Provider,"Okay. yeah okay. Well, so that's part of the grieving process to then this whole. picture in my head about the family that. The family that existed his parents and his family and then the one that you that you thought you were going to create with him. So that that does not mean you can't have a family. it's just gonna be different."
14845.0,Patient,"I just i'm getting nervous, because my mom had so many struggles with her miscarriages and it destroyed the family did have because of the way that she's handled it and. The amount of grief and shame disappointment and loss that she went through and then on top of that, the woman who are donated my X two who's got the babies now my my chosen name. she's putting a lot of pressure on me about my age and how I need to either freeze my eggs now or find a man right now yeah. Very good."
760.0,Provider,"How are you. i'm 2929 okay. I had I had my son in my 40s. And I did find. I don't know if you have some genetic. Issues that that I don't know about, have you have you when's the last time you went to see a gynecologist has Has anybody ever told you that just because your mother struggle with that does not necessarily mean it's going to be your struggle so i'm just wondering, is there any. medical evidence to suggest that that's the case for you."
14845.0,Patient,"yeah there's there's no reason to believe that, and you know I don't ended the AIDS like three years ago, or so. yeah and they wouldn't have let me do that if I had any fertility problems. Okay, but for my mom it was like she couldn't carry the baby for eggs were so Okay, but she had to remove a lot of them because of. They were pre cancerous. hmm and then. For my. chosen family she her excellent good anymore she's like from this $1,000 on ibs oh."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so you're so you're looking through this through the experience of both your mother. And this chosen family what they went through what she went through. yeah so there's many women that have. You know, it does not have to be that way, do you do you have any other women in your blood related women grandmothers and that struggled with fertility. That you know about."
14845.0,Patient,"I don't know what their experiences, but."
760.0,Provider,"did your mother have siblings does she. yeah okay. Okay, so so maybe there's a part of you that's taking on this pressure, and because of this shared experience with these two women in your life you're afraid that that's going to be your experience and I don't find a partner."
14845.0,Patient,yeah.
760.0,Provider,"it's always a risk. As always. You know it's true, but you know there's many, many women statistically there's many, many women who don't struggle. make sense. yeah and unless you have some other reason to think that way, the other, the other risks. That I would have you consider is that if you don't work on your mental health and you try to have kids with the wrong guy. And not having worked through you know your childhood stuff what kinds of mental health stresses are you're going to create on yourself and in your kids."
14845.0,Patient,yeah.
760.0,Provider,So that's that's like more concrete more statistically more probable so you know that's part of you know. understanding that and working on that.
14845.0,Patient,I understand and.
760.0,Provider,Emotionally that fear is still there.
14845.0,Patient,"yeah okay yeah, but I feel more confident in me not causing any harm to my future kids because I am so critical of the way that my mom did it and I analyze things and i've gone through many years of therapy and insurance. Things so like I am and i've been playing a role, such as like a stepmother to other kids in my life before. yeah okay."
760.0,Provider,So you you feel ready to some degree.
14845.0,Patient,yeah like I see the way that I am with canes yeah i'm extremely expensive i'm i'm very gentle very patient yeah arjun that cover feel impulse to her child okay so. yeah.
760.0,Provider,well.
14845.0,Patient,"You know that's within my control my behaviors. shown up yet weight. versus on fertility, is not something that's behaviorally based."
760.0,Provider,"know well, maybe, maybe you maybe if that's something that's creating anxiety and you, you, you have the option to set up an appointment and just ask the question go to a doctor and see if you could get some kind of advice about that. Yes, i'm kind of information about that. That would be one suggestion."
14845.0,Patient,"I got. A pap smear like less than two years ago. But yeah I could I could get more information, I guess."
760.0,Provider,"mm hmm just ask the question go I think we're supposed to get a pap smear annually so go and get another one, and ask that question. and see what the doctor says about it and just that's that's a concrete action, you can take and then kind of go from there, you know you just talk about your experience with with your your mom's experience and see what he says. um. So I. So you're in Miami um. I think. A self help group right about now would be a good thing for you, because you're you're kind of in a transition, you know we've talked about how you know this, this relationship is ending and and I think getting out and doing something different would be helpful to you. Yes, because so just maybe give it a shot and see what happens I don't know I know with the pandemic, a lot of the. Meetings went to zoom because of pen pandemic and and I think there's still a lot of meetings some meetings in some areas like I think our in person. And then there's still a lot of in on zoom kind of meetings out there now and maybe through because of the lack of transportation, maybe you might want to start with zoom I don't know but. You know you, it is an adjustment. What if the cut the kinds of things that you're going to do to process your feelings as you're going through this grieving process, and all this change."
14845.0,Patient,"i'm going to do a lot of journaling. Okay at the journaling helps me a lot. Good um last night I did have finally like a good talk with my ex partner about everything. That helped. We were able to kind of like talk about. It was actually really awesome like he was sitting here he's like he's like I know that I have things to work on, and I want you to let me know what those things are. And he wrote down a list we came up with a list of everything that he needs to work on and he's like yep I totally agree with that yep I need to be more reliable you're right and then we're going to do, mine as well. I just have to be emotionally ready for that i'm still pretty tender."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so he's going to work on himself, does that mean that you're still trying to work it out with him or already, this is just your guys are going to maintain a different sort of relationship and become friends now is. Is that. What am I."
14845.0,Patient,he's working on himself because that's the kind of person audience. For himself he's not he's not doing it for me.
760.0,Provider,I see.
14845.0,Patient,"yeah and i'm like he's expressed before that he's afraid that we will be able to be friends that he'll lose my friendship. But. At the same time, I think that we both know that we're going to have to have some distance. For a. period of time. yeah because it's it's just going to drag out the hurts."
760.0,Provider,yeah it's and it's confusing. yeah yeah.
14845.0,Patient,And I just um I just I don't know I want. I want techniques for learning how to detach.
760.0,Provider,How to detach.
14845.0,Patient,From from that person from that relationship like. Like I just feel like so attached yeah and I don't want to be.
760.0,Provider,"Well, I think. Think. creating new attachments. Through a support system through a healing process. kind of as a replacement. minus the romantic side of it, because that that yeah because I think women, we have a tendency to put a lot of. emotion on our. relationship relationships. Not all women, but many. And so i've I would you know, in my own past I I had to. When I had to end a relationship that wasn't working what I did is I went to a support group and I started working on my own self esteem and I built a network of friends family, I was very open I processed my emotions. And I healed myself and so. I really do believe that if you could go if you can find a way to get to the in person meetings, again I don't know about the pandemic or the transportation, that you can struggle with but. meeting a good group of people like that would be kind of like a replacement so when you're feeling when you're feeling depressed about the loss of your. Of the relationship that you go to this meeting, and you talk about it, you share, about it, and then you talk about your experiences when when you were a kid. And, and there is a 12 is there's 12 steps to it. And you know you you start working those steps with a sponsor and there's a healing process in that and through that process is painful it's really painful as you're going through it, but when it's over. In my own experience when it when it was over, I look back and I could see the growth and I had a deep appreciation and thankfulness for the experience and and i'm now at peace with it, but it's been many, many years. So, replacing it, I really do believe the Al anon or adult children of alcoholics would be a good place because it would give you a foundation and a support and you do need to replace. This relationship, and I think it would be better for you to replace it with relationships centered on your healing instead of romance instead of that kind of relationship for now."
14845.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
760.0,Provider,"And, and you know it took me some time and just because you that you know they always say, and it was always scary for me, but I, I know that when. I had my son much older and there was always those risks, but everything turned out fine on my it's just I think the risk slightly higher everything turned out fine. And i'm not saying that that's going to happen for you, but I think you know talking to a doctor about it and find out really to get to assess really, what are the risks. And instead of having that ruminate in your head and worry you. Does that make sense."
14845.0,Patient,yeah that makes sense. yeah.
760.0,Provider,"And you know, and then I you know, then when you healed to a point that you healed and then the time can be right and and I do believe that you'll find somebody and it'll be the right time. That you know. And you'll be able to have the thing that the thing that you want be part start you know start that family with that person and be a parent a parenting team with that person. Okay, so that's what that's the way I would suggest that you go about it just get busy don't don't stay home ruminating. Worrying but, by all means, certainly feel the feelings express the emotion feel feel the feel the feelings don't don't hold on to that. But at the same time you got to tell yourself this this grieving it's a process you'll you'll you'll agree you'll crave it out, and you know 10 years from now, you you'll probably have some happy memories, but it won't have the pain, once you get through that the pain goes away. You know, in my experience, the pain over over a relationship like that goes away."
14845.0,Patient,I just hope I can find someone who's as amazing.
760.0,Provider,"well. If you heal on the inside, then you'll be ready, and I think there's a lot of amazing men and women in the world. And you'll be able to find the amazing guy that. That that you want to have it's just this the healing has to come first, because that's the best shot for a better, more successful relationship."
14845.0,Patient,"Right, you could meet the perfect person and if you're not healed you're going to mess up."
760.0,Provider,"Oh you're just not ready, the because, because when we you know you talk about anxiety you spent. The early parts of your life being raised. by people with an alcohol problem you had saved you were not saved, especially when you're with your mom you're still not safe with your mom that wires your brain and you know it's not your fault. it's not anything you did. You know it doesn't make you it just it but that's the way your brain got affected it kind of wired you that way and so that's what i'm talking about canceling that. Possible people, people do heal from that."
14845.0,Patient,Are there exercises that I can do to move from anxious attachment it's more secure attachment.
760.0,Provider,"I think. My best thing would be. For me affirmations worked I did affirmations. Okay, so affirmations. You can find you can use those you they're everywhere, you can find them all over the Internet, you can you can i'm sure there's applications now where you can get at affirmations. And and just kind of make a schedule out of it, maybe try to try to think of it as much as possible and and the other thing is. form a new attachment, because the most important relationship in your life or the in our lives, have to say it in general for all of us is the relationship we have with ourselves. And so, instead of focusing on the outward part of being attached to this person this guy. start focusing on attaching you know building relationship with yourself."
14845.0,Patient,What does that look like.
760.0,Provider,"It is a process. You it starts with baby steps it starts with honesty number one honesty towards myself and it starts with. Questioning the things that I believe. Processing my emotions seems like you're good at that he said you're using journaling. Building a support system. In you know, in a place where you can go and you talk about painful difficult things and you give and receive support in that way, which is why I really strongly do believe in 12 step groups helps probably millions of people from substance abusers to their families. For and a was founded in the 1930s and they they've been it they narcotics anonymous sprung and adult children of alcoholics Al Al anon sprung from that and it's helped lots and lots of people. And if you really true if you're working the 12 steps right. it's a whole healing process. Okay, so you can tell yourself, this is going to pass. You can. Just trust the process submit to the process. Set up the boundaries, but remember the most important relationship, you have. Is with yourself. And, and you know, and you know what and sometimes maybe we don't know what that means, and you just keep going with that so maybe we could do some. Self esteem stuff next time we can talk a little bit more, I have been talking to you about seeking safety a little bit. I didn't bring out the book, but I have been talking to you about it a little bit, would you be willing to at least go through zoom or if possible in person meetings, maybe three of them before our next session and tell me what that experience is like. i'm willing to do that. Or is that too."
14845.0,Patient,"Okay, I can do that. So do I sign up to buy breakfast health or do I sign up."
760.0,Provider,"Directly if it is self help you just show up you find a meeting and show up, you can Google it. You want me to do you need help with googling it do you want me to send you a referral, yes, yes it's it's it's kind of like church they. You know you don't pay for it, they they will pass a basket for you to hopefully kick in $1 because sometimes they'll have coffee and things like that, and they have to pay to rent the space if it's an in person meeting, so it costs money to operate the meeting but it's it's not. it's not an it's not organized in that way in any way. Okay, so you don't have to sign up you just have to find it, I would recommend that you make sure if you're going to go there, that you make sure that the meeting is operating, because I know Kobe through a lot off. And I don't know what life is like there in Florida when it comes to Kobe that I know it's still kind of. Out there the virus so. yeah so just make sure before you, especially since you don't have a car and it's not so easy make sure the meeting is operating and if you have to go through zoom. And, and I would the one the one thing they're going to do they're going to ask you to raise your hand as a newcomer I recommend that you do that and share a little bit. And just see what happens. But that the the healthy attachment start thinking in terms of. With myself."
14845.0,Patient,I don't know attachment to myself looks like. It.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, well then, yes. Yes, because this is part of the process."
14845.0,Patient,So maybe like instead of beating myself up when I make a mistake just pick myself up instead.
760.0,Provider,"yeah maybe you're not being fair to yourself. And you know what you're human, even if you did make a mistake you're human. yeah you're you're not it, you know you have good intent you don't you don't have bad intent. If I make a mistake, I have to forgive my mistake. Because i'm human. yeah and if I didn't make a mistake, sometimes we take that on, especially when we had traumatic events, especially for people who've been raised by people with substance abuse problems they take a lot of that on. Because, as a little child you don't understand that, I mean it's hard enough to understand addiction as an adult much less a little kid and. So you know understand, this is a process and just start opening your mind and think in terms start thinking in terms, maybe Journal on it a little bit. What would it be like to have a healthier version of me, or to be in relationship with me. Okay. All right, Morris, I hope I hope this helped."
14845.0,Patient,Thank you.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, we have our next. We have our next session scheduled."
14845.0,Patient,know.
760.0,Provider,Can can you reach out to the vc and get that scheduled in a couple weeks okay.
14845.0,Patient,So two weeks from now.
760.0,Provider,"yeah probably be good and and if you if you feel the need, you can go more than three times to the meeting but try it out."
14845.0,Patient,as well.
760.0,Provider,"All right, it was good, seeing you. Soon okay."
14845.0,Patient,i'll take care.
760.0,Provider,You too. bye.
