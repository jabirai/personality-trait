705.0,Provider,This will be a 12 o'clock with Sierra last name Gibbons GI bb I n s Sarah Gibbons waiting for patient.
11889.0,Patient,then start there we go.
705.0,Provider,"All right, here we go, how are you."
11889.0,Patient,"i'm good, how are you."
705.0,Provider,"Good I think last time I saw you, you were preparing for your birthday wish."
11889.0,Patient,"Yes, yes, I was it was a great birthday. My fiance to be basically to the clouds is the way to put it, we went to like a really high point in San Francisco and the view is basically just like clouds I mean it literally looks like a sea of clouds it was beautiful."
705.0,Provider,wow. That sounds amazing what a special birthday.
11889.0,Patient,"Now, have you been."
705.0,Provider,"i've been very well, thank you for asking, and I was gonna say to, so this is your fiance that I, I guess, after that he's a keeper."
11889.0,Patient,yeah right here.
705.0,Provider,"Oh good good good how's everything else, been going."
11889.0,Patient,"it's going good, I think I get a little bit more exhausted lately a little bit irritable. And I feel like a lot more the past like couple weeks um but I mean good other than that. Everything else is good just mood swings sometimes it's hard to control."
705.0,Provider,"Okay, can you ever feel when they're about to to come on like sometimes people. Can notice, I can writing changes or I know I work with someone that. She wants to change your hair color is a good signal for her."
11889.0,Patient,"So, yes and no it's definitely a lot easier to send some obviously they would my senses get overloaded and stuff like that. Other times I feel like it's just the switch. My turning off or not. It goes back and forth it just depends on the day. I feel like you know more recently. Especially this past Sunday, it was more like a switch like I felt Okay, when I woke up and then like probably like an hour into me being awake I was just like irritated with everything."
705.0,Provider,"Sometimes to it takes. to identify it like different different tools are used, like Have you ever used a mood calendar, where you can try to start logging were."
11889.0,Patient,"No, I."
705.0,Provider,"OK, I will send you a couple of different ones, and just pick which one you like the best and work with it. Okay, what will happen is. If you can fill out the mood you know the mood charts, then it will give us a better picture of what's going on, that will probably help you care to see where it's like Okay, I can recognize now a little bit better. That okay that switches hit something else starts going on whether that's fixed physical or like things you say to yourself."
11889.0,Patient,Okay sounds good.
705.0,Provider,and on Sunday. Before you woke up what was Saturday like for you.
11889.0,Patient,"busy so my son had a football game Sunday morning, and you know the night before i'm just. trying to get everything ready and making sure everybody's in mind, making sure everybody's in bed on time. Make sure everybody gets you know got fed everybody's closing server ready for the next day, making sure you know, he has all his stuff there so that we don't have to wake up in the morning and be looking around for things. That was my Saturday and Sunday, but I want to say. Something. Oh no that wasn't Saturday i'm thinking about Monday we went Halloween shopping on Monday. i'm not sure I think we were home most Saturday and just me getting prepared for the next day."
705.0,Provider,"Okay, so a lot of times to what happens is you know, sometimes a precursor that you're going, you know, maybe more depressive or going more towards peaking with them like you were saying irritation and things like that can even be stress especially that's able for. What do you right now to alleviate some of your stress."
11889.0,Patient,"Honestly, right now, I kind of just. Take a second to myself i'll go to my room or just have my kids like tell my kids like please just like go sit down for a second. It it's a lot right now is a lot of just taking a moment to myself or trying to find a moment to myself to breathe."
705.0,Provider,"yeah it's it sounds say Sarah that you don't have a lot of opportunities to kind of ground yourself free Center hit the reset button during the day. Okay. Anything that you've tried, maybe in the past that you could bring back and see if you could incorporate that into your daily schedule, I know it's crammed packed."
11889.0,Patient,um. i've tried delegating some of the things that I take on. But then when it isn't done the way that I wanted to dive it kind of. frustrates me as well.
705.0,Provider,Okay.
11889.0,Patient,So I kind of don't know how to balance both worlds out.
705.0,Provider,that's good insight right. yeah yeah so you wanted to delegate some which has been helpful but also you're seeing that you have a tendency. to view it is that it's not the way that maybe you would wanted it.
11889.0,Patient,"Like, for example. Last night I am I asked for you know. My kids wanted cookies and stuff you're having a movie night and things like that it was the last night before they were going to their dads they went to their dads morning. And so we kind of had a little family night, and I was already tired, because I have you know really done. Things throughout the day and I just I was just tired and I didn't want to get up and I asked for cookies to be made right and you just put them in the baking sheet put them in the oven it's already pre made. It put the cookies instead of being put on a cookie sheet were put into a. cake pan. And then all the cookies touching each other, and then they are all it to me they just didn't cook properly and then all of your different sizes and different. You know flavors and different things like that, and even though the cookies got done, I think it just irritated me more than it should have."
705.0,Provider,"I appreciate that you're being honest and this is how we do self discovery, because it is sometimes that way where you want the help, but then, when you get the help it's like but I didn't want that kind of helped I wanted. This kind of help. right with the communication if it's not there. The other party doesn't have a crystal ball and so they're. just doing their best."
11889.0,Patient,"So it's it's things like that that I just I tell myself it's just better if you just do it right, so, but then I just feel like long doing everything by myself a nice it starts to feel really lonely and really frustrating. So. trying to find a balance, but I haven't found it yet. And I I feel like that's also been one of the biggest struggles at as well."
705.0,Provider,"But you know it is like why each day you know I strive for that balance, but it has its challenges and having where you're asking for assistance and then reevaluating okay let's look at what happened so then it was done in a way that wouldn't have been your way. Like you wouldn't have used to pan that you didn't do as the appropriate pan and you would have done it where they're all consistent in sizes."
11889.0,Patient,Yes.
705.0,Provider,"Is it possible for you now that you're looking back and learning from it, is it possible to let go of any of that were, it has to be like, if you delegate and give it away is no way for you to actually give it away."
11889.0,Patient,"See I tell myself, yes, like my logical so wants to be like absolutely yeah like it wasn't a big deal every every 30 so, and you know everyone's happy today. But then the other like side of my brain it feels like tells me that there's wrong and right and that was just so wrong like like who puts cookies in a cake. You know."
705.0,Provider,"Right, and this is where, again, I appreciate your honesty shear, and this is how we get down to the core of things is, then, then yes is. My that statement, then you can start to change, because if you believe that the cookies need to be a certain way you're going to want the cookies to be a certain way, no matter what. Even if you don't indicate that's the expectation."
11889.0,Patient,Right.
705.0,Provider,"If you can change how you view things and with maybe the cookie so if it's something like some things you can't change, like the the care for your children probably you don't have a lot of flexibility on that."
11889.0,Patient,it's all right.
705.0,Provider,"Health and safety paramount right. Before the cookies could you start to catch yourself and reframe it. If it's just saying to yourself. I know they're going to do it, a different way and that's Okay, or something like that, where you believe it."
11889.0,Patient,Right yeah I could try that.
705.0,Provider,"example that you gave how could you look at it, a different way."
11889.0,Patient,"The kids love cookies regardless. Yes, and even say that now, with the smile."
705.0,Provider,"Before you're like who, in their right mind to cookie."
11889.0,Patient,"I I just shocked, to say the least, I was just shocked it's i'm noticing it's very, very hard for them i've noticed i'm a very, very right is right wrong is wrong person i've been noticing that a lot lately, and if you feel like. That is my issue when it comes to. Like i've always been the type of person it's like you know I don't do anything to anybody i'm really, really nice and stuff like that I don't know what I do wrong. But I think where i'm going wrong. is always feeling like i'm right. But then it's hard for me to say, like Oh, I feel like i'm, not that I feel like i'm right. But it's like again like right is right wrong is wrong, I don't feel like there's an in between sometimes and that's difficult it's been difficult for me to deal with that part."
705.0,Provider,"yeah and it can be, you know that black and white thinking economists thinking is it's either this way or this way and there's no Gray there's no left to each their own interpretation. starting to notice, if you have a tendency to do that, it can be sometimes a sense of control, if you put things in a right or wrong category you're feeling a sense of control over that. So it's learning how to hey, what can I give up control that I don't need to take control over because i'm already stressing myself out about cookies and cake pan and it's just like can I look at this another way. Right we're at the end of the day, you said, the kids."
11889.0,Patient,They study. They didn't even know they didn't pay attention to the fact that the cookies were not in the right pan.
705.0,Provider,"Right and now you can let you can laugh about it, you can smile about it, but in the moment it is where, if you have that type of thinking you're going to be stressed, your body was probably stressed to tend to not. play, what do I say, do I say something do I not."
11889.0,Patient,Right.
705.0,Provider,Could you feel anything going on physically.
11889.0,Patient,"yeah I definitely felt a knot in my throat definitely felt like it, I really needed to say something like it was really hard not to. You know I did say like who the hell does that but, like not directed like kind of just like out loud. And like I did get mad I did I went to my room and I was just like done with my night I was just like like what the hell like what type of thing you know. um. So yeah I definitely I definitely felt myself good get angry."
705.0,Provider,"yeah this isn't about you know we're talking about it, exploring reevaluating it this isn't about taking it internally and judging yourself it's like No, this is what goes on, with me i'm trying to learn and, as you said, strive for that balance. right by being honest and real with. ourselves how we can can promote self growth."
11889.0,Patient,"yeah definitely i'm definitely in a point to where like i'm self aware now I feel like I wasn't in the past. And so it is hard, because I do beat myself up so i'm glad i'm glad you said that, because it is. I you know I take it, I realize it like you know the whole cookie situation is like, why did you react that way like why, and I just start beating myself up over it, and i'm just like so myself like Is this the way you're going to be and, like. I just don't want to ruin anything else."
705.0,Provider,"Even if you look further than that it's here it's that sense of control and that sense to need to control developed earlier in your childhood and you brought it into your adulthood. I know you said to because sometimes when we have these things about ourselves, it can be a strength to like I know you were into competitive sports. yeah and in competitive sports maybe in that arena it worked for you. So then it's just like okay i'm building on that, and then you get to life, and you have kids and you have a fiance. And it's like this, this adjustment. And it's more way just to say hey my life has changed and so now my coping strategies and how I navigate through the world maybe need some some adjustments fine tuning. doesn't mean that everything at your core. is incorrect it just means building on it and making improvements where you see fit."
11889.0,Patient,"So today's show is easier said than done, you know, like I like yeah I like it sounds so great, like everything you're saying sounds amazing i'm just like I just really wanted to work yeah."
705.0,Provider,"And I would even backup from that because it's just like you are absolutely right that. In that moment, will you be able to stop yourself counteract whatever state, you know statement you were going to say. Have a different interpretation and do this whole you know we call it cognitive behavioral therapy, where you look at it in a different way, if you give yourself a different way to view something. You will then change you're filling which will change your thoughts which will change your behavior."
11889.0,Patient,"Okay, like a ripple effect."
705.0,Provider,"It absolutely is here's the key, though. When you said it doesn't happen too so quickly that's cute. And it takes practice, and so, first of all have self compassion so be kind to yourself if you can start to catch you said already, like you're You know yourself, you felt physically already. Right you that's your cue so when something starts to not feel right and your body's already responding see if you can start catching just like tell your stuff so people will do is stop stop thinking or stop thought and just think of a stop sign. Okay, you can either visualize it or you can just stay say to yourself, stop. Taking break and I know, in the middle of kids wanting cookies and all that it might be a short break. Right give yourself permission just you know visualize a stop sign or say stop see which one works for you see if you can remove yourself for a few minutes, take a few breaths or you might start to think too because you're competitive like could it be thinking about sport. start to see what strategy is going to help you remove yourself from the situation, take a breather. If you can start to learn that, then you can start to build on. Now I removed myself now The hope is that I would allow myself more time to start to practice the skill of changing how I view things. But it doesn't happen, like a 123. It takes time. It can be done."
11889.0,Patient,Take it day by day.
705.0,Provider,"Yes, yes, and each day is like are ready, we have children it's like preparing yourself for the battlefield. You know what are you going to throw at me today. If you can even work into getting yourself to relax at some you know, having in your daily schedule just a moment for yourself to relax. you're going to find that if these things happen throughout the day that maybe you don't go to a 10 and have to leave the room that maybe you go to an eight you know. Right, even if it's a 9.50 it's still you know progress."
11889.0,Patient,sounds good.
705.0,Provider,"Do you have any time you know, maybe with the kiddos to go for a walk outside."
11889.0,Patient,"I do it's a little hard sometimes to read a you know leave my home, especially when i'm by myself. I just worry about everything you know really everything, the first thing I think about is like you know, a woman alone with her kids outside and so it's it's difficult. Sometimes. But I try, even if it's just me sitting right here, outside of my friend, or all my daughter plays. But normally like we won't head to the park or anything, and so my fiance's."
705.0,Provider,"And that can happen, you know, especially trauma in the past, where you start to view that the world is dangerous and that's where with cognitive behavior to is the core filling usually develops in time because we traumatic events. Being able to recognize, you know Okay, I have this core belief that the world is dangerous because of my experience. Being able, in time, like you said as a small step is really a huge step you're going outside the House is telling yourself that you know what this is safe. And so the world isn't all unsafe there's some places that maybe and you get that that that maybe in there that may be safe, such as your front door."
11889.0,Patient,Right.
705.0,Provider,and doing that enough times and feel uncomfortable and when you feel ready to expand from there. i'm hearing to that with your fiance you feel safe and going to the park so that's an expansion to.
11889.0,Patient,Sure it's definitely. easier to go anywhere with him really mean he just he just asked asked me to go like okay. yeah.
705.0,Provider,yeah and it's learning more about you and you learning more about you know and how each of you respond to different things.
11889.0,Patient,"yeah I feel like recently i've been i've been taking a little bit more of a toll on him and. You know I you know it's also been hard is, I feel like you know coming out of my toxic relationship with my children side and stuff. Some of the things that he would do you know that were toxic. I feel like sometimes in this relationship, even though he doesn't do any of those things. If I see something that kind of reminds me of it, it automatically like you know triggers me and stuff like that, so one of you know biggest thing is that would happen is you know my ex he would invalidate me, and you know almost like you know nurses very narcissistic. And you know, even if he was the one you know that did something to me like if he cheated on me and you know you would come back and be like well it's because. You don't work and you don't do any of this and you don't do any of that like it was always my fault and so like on Sunday. And the day that I was having a really bad day we argue is bad day for us as well you know we didn't speak for most of the morning in the afternoon, even though we had her my son's football game and stuff. We got an argument literally right at the moment, we were actually in vehicle to go into the football stadium. But I also felt like. I kept telling him like you know it's easy for you to blame these issues on me because i'm the one with the issues right. And I feel like. Sometimes, like. Like I don't know if he's just not taking responsibility for the things he's doing or and or if it's like really like just It really is me. And so I think i'm sending it out that that was like the biggest thing like that was it, you know I walked I walked away telling him that, like it's easy for you to blame these. Things on me, but I thought I think that morning what really set me over was the fact that you know I didn't get everybody stuff ready, the day before. But I felt like I was the first one awake the next morning, but the last one out the door, and I feel like he just he just doesn't get that sometimes, and I wish Maybe it was just because. I have a bad way you know saying things once i'm angry, or I don't even know if I said it at all, but I just wanted his help that day. And then I felt like he was blaming me for being irritated."
705.0,Provider,"And a lot of that goes back to what you were sharing before, is that you have the self awareness that you feel like yes you're busy, and you want some help you want to delegate what you need. But if it's not done in a certain way and it's almost where that is old messages come back to replay you might as well have done it yourself. And then hearing the extra already internal i'm the one who issues so anytime I talk about this or that we have a difference of opinion or just you know, a disagreement about something anything arises, I feel like it's my fault. Where it's both parties, I mean if you know he's choosing to be in the relationship you're choosing to be in the relationship and learning again how to work as a team. Okay, and. Do you ever like how did he respond when you said I feel like it's always my spot my fault."
11889.0,Patient,"And he was like no wonder, he said, no one said it was your fault. He goes, but you talk to me so ugly he's like all you do is yell at me so you don't understand you just snap he's like I just have to deal with it and I realized I slammed the door and I just walked away. yeah so I just felt like he was just blaming me for something that he had done to me, even though he didn't I guess he didn't know what hit them i'm not sure you know I kind of I feel like I have a blackout moments like that."
705.0,Provider,"And a lot of past experience, come to play to where you feel like the the party before you know the person was toxic and say you bring that into this relationship and it's normal that we treat. A new people in the relationship, like the old ones and it's. You know, down to the cords. Defense mechanism you're trying to protect yourself."
11889.0,Patient,"he's literally the sweetest thing he's so sweet. I don't notice it is feel like i'm always you know I am he says no, I do I do everything for him it's like it's almost kind of like that that perfect husband and wife. Really ship, or what you would say it's quote unquote perfect, but then there's that part where it's like well she kind of switches it is kind of like heaven hell. it's really hard."
705.0,Provider,"How do you think like right now, are you taking any medications to help like instead of attend to bring you down."
11889.0,Patient,"So i've been off of my medications because I had been having the issues. matter of fact, I actually had an issue today before this appointment, they were telling me that I was an active and there wasn't going to be able to have this appointment. So that I finally just said, you know what I need to talk to a manager so she's trying to. get my medication she's trying to get marry, even though Mary isn't my practitioner anymore she's trying to get her to just give me a rebuild so that I can have my medications but she hasn't gotten back to me about it yet."
705.0,Provider,hi.
11889.0,Patient,"So I think that's also been definitely playing a factor I I feel like when I was on my medications I was waking up early I was getting my house clean, I was on top of it. Everything was relaxing and then now I feel like i've been struggling again and keep up with the House or getting very overwhelmed by how much needs to be done, so I just kind of don't do it."
705.0,Provider,"Right and sometimes Sarah medication can help. lower the intensity where you learn these new skills, because you're right, you know when we've been doing things for so many years, like I get it, we have these you know ways that we go about the world and especially if there's been trauma in the past. Where. If you've got some medication that reduces the intensity even a little bit you'll have more of an ability to make some changes I did see and i'm so glad that you went to the virtual Center because I do see that that Sharon sets is going to do the refill. Okay yeah cuz I can see, on here, where you called just like you said, and last I see is today, which is the 13th. I will refill and assurance that's. Did they talk to you. About attending groups."
11889.0,Patient,"So yeah so I told I told her all my Mondays and Tuesdays that I have my kids at days and now, since my fiance got his promotion he's never really here he's been here only the the past couple weeks because he was on vacation and then he got put in quarantine. But other than that he works now, and so they were trying to figure out at first they had started scheduling me on Friday. which you were supposed to be in that group as well, but then, when I met up with the woman that does the groups on Friday, she was like that's an opioid group there's no reason she was like absolutely zero reason for you to even be in that group at all."
705.0,Provider,Which group was.
11889.0,Patient,She said it was like an opioid addiction group.
705.0,Provider,"which should can because I do two groups I. yeah I do it eight o'clock am and not one some mental health. California group, and then I do a 12 o'clock, which is supposed to be."
11889.0,Patient,12 o'clock yeah.
705.0,Provider,yeah that one's a mental health slash medicaid an assistant for substance use disorder.
11889.0,Patient,"yeah she so she ended up canceling all of them, because she said that that wouldn't help me. that the group wouldn't help me so she ended up just taking me out of that group and said that someone would contact me to figure out my groups."
705.0,Provider,"yeah we'll see were you know that you feel you would be the better fit to come into groups. And then I wanted to see to so the care intensity what the care intensity right now, as on is weekly groups and then twice a month for your individual therapy. With the care intensity and it depends on which group you're going to Sierra but sometimes if you have work school childcare issues you could lower. How many you know, like let's say instead of weekly groups if maybe you would go to twice a month and see what that does, I could I could change it right now, but it may be reset by the new prescriber. Okay, you want me to do that."
11889.0,Patient,yeah that's fine.
705.0,Provider,"Okay, so, then what i'm going to do, then, is for changing to twice a month for. And i'm putting work or school conflict because there's not a child care one but that's basically what it is because you're working. And so we're going to do twice a month, so, then you can just remember twice a month twice a month, if this changes. Then I will let you know. And i'll send that out to just to alert your care navigators and see who, that is. that's Alice Catherine Elisa McCauley. So I will let her know to i'll do an inquiry and let her know it change."
11889.0,Patient,Thank you.
705.0,Provider,uh huh.
11889.0,Patient,"yeah. I have a bearded dragon and he's a free roaming bearded dragon so he walks around, just like the cats and a dog. Oh, but he has worms in a container and he's trying to get them through the container."
705.0,Provider,Oh. He doesn't he. doesn't know that.
11889.0,Patient,they're in like a little prayer container.
705.0,Provider,that's hilarious. he's like I just know that this keeps being.
11889.0,Patient,"Full screen, you can stop trying to eat them through a little continue."
705.0,Provider,"That is funny. So. let's let's see if the new prescriber if they can work with the twice a month and so they'll talk to you, and again I don't want to it's up to two prescriber with the groups of how often you go so right now there's such a the twice a month, a big need feel for you to come in every. Day until you stabilize your. lesson, how many times. And then you and I are on twice a month. I was looking to I don't think we have. Our second one planned our next session."
11889.0,Patient,We don't know right yeah.
705.0,Provider,"And when I look at individual sessions. It looks like. You and I met let's see we did on the 20 or. Okay, so on the 13th which is today, and so we'll need to make one more appointment for this month. Is there a certain day that you want me to take a look at."
11889.0,Patient,"Just Wednesdays and Thursdays, preferably."
705.0,Provider,And arrangement with. For childcare do the alternate your kiddos alternate like every couple of weeks.
11889.0,Patient,So it's called a two to five. So I have them Mondays and Tuesdays and Wednesdays and Thursdays and then we switch off every Friday Saturday and Sunday.
705.0,Provider,"whoa Oh, the heart."
11889.0,Patient,"yeah you're gonna get you through even during for two years now, you kind of get a little used to it. Okay yeah. it's a basically so the kids can see as exactly half and half."
705.0,Provider,It seems that it's working out for you.
11889.0,Patient,"it's different battle definitely. had my struggles with them, I I kind of mentioned it to you on our last appointment, we didn't have much time to talk about it but. He did try and like file a restraining order against me, not because I did anything to him, but because I got mad that. He had my kids doctors appointments for me and had his sister take them to the doctor instead of. letting me know that they needed to go, because he worked so he's not even available during the week during the day. And I told him, you know if they have if they have an appointment, let me know because no one's responsibility and he had it for me and my kids ended up getting vaccinations and stuff like that and. Because I got angry about it, he tried to file restraining order against me. We went to court, she she threw out the restraining order and less than a minute. Better cheese it's just one of those battles yeah he's. Having another kid now, and you know stuff like that I thought I thought, when he would get a girlfriend and stuff that it would just continue. Because before he got with this girl, we had a great co parenting relationship, it was amazing. He got along with my fiance we would meet up for dinner, we would take them to the park, he would come over here, we would go there, they would have beer skin, they would play games together. And then, when he got with this girl, it was just like a huge one at like he became ugly and nasty. wants no communication wants nothing to do with co parenting wants nothing to do with my fiance it's very much like he acts at this point, as if, like when the kids are with me he's not a dad and when the kids are with him i'm not at all like. it's very much like that this point with him."
705.0,Provider,"On that makes it hard for you, for you care to be able to adjust to such a change that you didn't have any heads up you know, like know what we were working with maybe you know his relationship like you said, has changed, and they have maybe agreements. Keeping though your communication, you know it's just like Okay, what can you do it's like pulling back. Are you establishing then like what you can you know control."
11889.0,Patient,"I try there he he basically takes my control from me like I said when if there with him i'm not a mom there with me he's not a God. I you know tried getting my son a cell phone because. I know you know it started affecting school and things like that and, at the start of this school year I was like you know i'm not dealing with any of that we're going to get this done right like. You know, you need to pass your football you can't play football, if you don't pass you know you know football's not cheap it's expensive, and you know things like that and. And the first day that he had his phone there and his dad's which I let his dad know that he was going to have a phone prior I let him know why we were getting the phone. I let him know you know you don't want to have communication that's Okay, now we get to communicate through Sunday only time that we don't have to. Or we won't is if it's something private and that he shouldn't be involved in, but if it comes. You know, to win his football game is or if he needs to do this homework sheet or anything like that we can just text him they let your mom no I said this hey let your dad no I said this and he agreed. The first day that he went over there with this phone just so happens to be the date of the doctors thing. And the way I found out about it was because my son had facetime me from his phone and we were talking and then my daughter had mentioned she got shot. And I was like hold on, and then I called his dad his dad got home a couple hours later, and my son never saw his phone again he took his phone from him, he said, his cell phone is not allowed in his household. So it's like even when I try. it's there's like it's like he, like he basically really expects me to act like i'm just not a mother when they're over there. he's very much like act like she doesn't exist."
705.0,Provider,"Much gonna take Sierra probably some time to. start to even more so, like chipping away and okay we're how, how can I still feel good about them going there and secure that they're going to be, you know. I don't get the sense that you don't think they're taken care of it's just more that you want it to be notified if they're having something like a medical."
11889.0,Patient,"For sure like i'm there month for one that was the first appointment, I had ever missed a nine years. Like how are you going to send your kid with someone that doesn't even know what is or what has been going on with them, since they were born, like, I can tell you, everything, since the day that my children were born. Can you can she can anybody else besides me do that and know. Like again, this is where it's hard for me to do it's that wrong is wrong right is right moment. My gosh is completely so wrong in my opinion. And I can't get past that. You know I can't look at it hit from his point of view, because. i'm in my head i'm like what parent in their right mind would want anybody besides a parent to take their kid to a doctor's appointment, or to be involved in or medical. You know you already mean."
705.0,Provider,"I do Sierra and to be hearing that that's not a situation that let's just say we can't Compare that to. cookies being made a cake pan it's like No, this is your child's safety and it's you have valid reasons, this is about their safety and their health and you want to be a part of that, I think that you have very valid reasons it's like yes, this upset me. sounds like you made a really big mistake and i'm hoping that in the future, maybe this wouldn't repeat but i'm hearing that he's kind of just said then you're not the mom why I have them."
11889.0,Patient,"But even if it's something as simple as like me wanting to know what they're up to you, like you, don't need to know that. So it's definitely been a battle with that. You know, he tried to he made himself look crazy in court, but. He tried to basically what I think he did was try to file a restraining order because he wanted to change our custody, but I think he wanted to go wanted it to go in his way, so he tried to make me look bad. And so, when it was addressed in court, she you know she she went over the. The restraining order and she was like you know it just sounds like. You lied to her and she was upset about it unless there's anything else you want to add he goes no let's just get to the krusty part and like He threw his hand in the air. And she said i'm not even going to discuss that with you get out of my corner get out of my court room, you can do it the right way if that's what you want to talk about. And I can like you know i'm able to see the stipulations and things that he wants because of that, and I don't know if he's going to actually take me to court to pursue these things correctly or not he hasn't so far. But the things that he wants are just absolutely 100% not in the best interest of our children at all and. That. Is super difficult for me to. process because, even though our relationship was toxic and he was terrible person to me and he's so as a terrible person to me i've always thought about him differently when it came to being a father and so to see the way that. he's trying to change our children's life and not for the better. it's hard to process that, and you know see him and not get angry, or you know not go off or not be, and it also hurts like it hurts more than the divorce, because these are kids. Sometimes I just don't know how to process that part, and so I try not to think about it, I feel like that's what makes me put things off. Because it's just it's like people are like well how can you how can you believe it because he's a terrible person like even though someone is terrible person it doesn't make them a terrible father or mother."
705.0,Provider,"Right, the part of hearing choosier this you're seeing that it hasn't happened yet, and I think, yes, of course, your alarms are going off as you're reading this. Is there a way to pull yourself back where for right now, you haven't seen any movement that this is going to happen and could it be he's just. venting and did things out of anger to."
11889.0,Patient,possible for sure.
705.0,Provider,"i'm glad you're talking about it, and I think that this is healthy and again I mean your alarms are going off for good reason, as you know that this wouldn't be in the best interest. Being able to talk about that, and you sit behind it, you know there's a lot of hurt identifying the feeling that's healthy. Bringing yourself back to at the end of the day. This isn't occurring yet and it might not ever and so. What I can do. to pull it back in when it becomes too overwhelming."
11889.0,Patient,I tried to do that and I tried to lend myself like. Your cars your current because the agreement stands because you know nothing's changed so you would think everything will be fine because we have a customer agreement it's law abiding like you know you have to go buy it. But that's not wait. that's not the way it goes. Right never.
705.0,Provider,"yeah is is it then we're Okay, so you have you have what's supposed to be the law that might not be being followed, is it even know things here that, like some things you can dismiss and something's not."
11889.0,Patient,"which I feel like. This time around, I am, for example, our customer agreement. states that we're supposed to spend. All the holidays and birthdays together. Sorry i'm like them took."
705.0,Provider,No worries I know my my allergies this morning.
11889.0,Patient,"um but we're supposed to spend all holidays, and you know birthdays together well, we had already started having our issues. With that, when he first got with this girl, so this isn't our first holidays stuff so I knew that this year was going to be different. But normally for Halloween because Halloween is just one night and it's a little bit different I still tried it and do Halloween together, which we did Halloween together last year still. But this year on the custody papers when he had took me to court for the restraining order. I saw that he wanted me to have them. For Halloween. And at first, but i'm Definitely not. In it, for me, so I even when I saw that I was like no, they should see both of us, even if it's. There with you during the day, and you get them dress further night for trick or treating and you know it's do stuff like that, and then I pick them up, and then I take up trigger tree. that's the way, I think it should be, because I feel like that's important to our kids they love absolutely you know they love their dad. But they love how how special I make the holidays, because holidays have always been big to me the holidays are not big to him, he will literally go buy them a bag of candy from the store if you wanted to and be like there you go you got your candy for Halloween type thing. And so. I tried to give them the best of both worlds. But I didn't want to argue. This time, so all I did was messaged him be like hey I saw you wanted me to have them for Halloween is I would you still want he said yes, I said cool. and they're like that was the first time that I was really able to do that, but. I also feel like i'm just so exhausted. At this point, which is the only reason why it was just a little bit easier."
705.0,Provider,"It can be. And, especially as you're describing it it's almost like okay so, then we have the guidelines of what we're doing, but then the guidelines change. and adapt. To that change and then going back. To what are you willing to make changes and what are you like I don't feel like this is any room for flexibility. Right yeah."
11889.0,Patient,"i'm definitely no flexibility when it comes to medical there should never be. In the custody agreement in the response I put I put that you know I the way I would want it to be is if. There with you, you make the appointment you left the other and you can't be there you let the other parent, even if you can be there, you still at the other parent know about the appointment. If you can't be there, you ask the other parent if they can take them to the appointment if neither party, you know, neither party can take. The child to the appointment, then both parties agree to who will take the child to the appointment. Right and I feel like that's there's no if ands or buts about something like that."
705.0,Provider,"yeah I mean to me that sounds reasonable. Here I well yeah you know, but now I said, will he comply with it."
11889.0,Patient,"And then you know he messaged me, you know with that me just saying that it's like oh you're crazy oh you just need to be in control. And then that feeling of like okay so because I kind of know that I do have issues with being in control, am I, being controlling it like those like I fight with myself. And then, like you know I kind of start to shut down and then I stopped because i'm starting to shut down I get angry and then I just blow up, because then i'm just like at this point or not freaking listening like shut up and listen. And then everything slows up."
705.0,Provider,"And then do you feel like you're back to square one, and you're like Okay, where do I go from here. It can definitely be a situation where with changes, especially like this, where a lot of what is your control and what's outside of your control. is greater because you're sharing custody with your children and being able to re evaluate as changes are made of what's priority what's what's not and like you said you have a really good grounding of what's priority is your children's health and safety. yeah and then things that go beyond that you can take a look at like you were saying for Halloween. Now it is to a one of those things, Sarah that. Sometimes it's just like we can talk about solutions and different strategies and it's going to be maybe at some level on some days, where he's going to choose to do. Whatever you may feel like on that day and and maybe he's unhealthy and it's like how, how can you just know and be like Okay, I did I did my best. and being able to come back into your immediate environment, how you feel safe and secure and like almost hanging on to that even closer right."
11889.0,Patient,You get it.
705.0,Provider,"Not to discount feelings at all like that's a lot of stuff to be going on and it's just like. In a sense, it's like you're learning to fly a plane and flying the plane, at the same time. This is the right territory. Right mm hmm. You are doing your best and you are trying new things, and just like today celebrate your big wins you got online you're here check it off big one of the day. Okay well i'm able to share and be open and honest. That is a lot of people don't even have that where they can't even be open and honest with themselves and then heck no with sharing that with someone else."
11889.0,Patient,"yeah and guys, I think. being honest hasn't really been positive in my life but. it's definitely something I can't change about myself."
705.0,Provider,"Oh, here again it's very valuable and to have that level of trust and be vulnerable with here's how my true thoughts were behind that like things like with the cooking pan and how your thought process goes that's a huge level of vulnerability, that you are willing to do today. That takes courage."
11889.0,Patient,and
705.0,Provider,"that's why you see a lot of people that aren't in counseling because they're running from it there stay in the denial i'm going to stay, you know back where I don't have to deal with it. So, at the end of the day, you are human. you're doing your best. pull in each day even maybe focus on writing three things that you like. About yourself that day that you did or three things that you felt that went where you were like you know what i'm satisfied with this."
11889.0,Patient,"Okay, I can try that."
705.0,Provider,"sounds good, and then I was looking to at the calendar on October the 27th which would be Wednesday. And who would you want to meet on a Wednesday."
11889.0,Patient,"Yes, that would work perfect."
705.0,Provider,It looks like I have an 1130. All the way I have like an 11 3012 o'clock. 1135 okay 1130 so we'll do that 1130 on October 27.
11889.0,Patient,Okay.
705.0,Provider,Do you need to put it on your phone or anything if it blocks out for a minute I know what you're doing is no. that's what usually people started to key it in where get it all in there and I will do that on this sense here.
11889.0,Patient,and
705.0,Provider,So we're looking at October 27. That is a Wednesday.
11889.0,Patient,And we're going to do 11:30am okay got it.
705.0,Provider,"Okay, and not one saved there so that will be great and, until then, to is i'll send you to add that, to the list of i'm just sending you some wellness information i'm going to add the cognitive behavior to and challenging thoughts. i've read through I said about eight different things, and so just scan through it see what you think will work best. And then we'll go from there is there a goal that you want to put out there and then we'll talk about it again when we meet again."
11889.0,Patient,And yeah I just really want to be able to go somewhere by myself.
705.0,Provider,"yeah so playing where before we meet again on that 27 is maybe try and something independently, is what i'm hearing. Yes, okay. Is there someone that's supportive to that can be like where you're going to go, you know the meetup like have a meet up for coffee or some type of like smoothie."
11889.0,Patient,"um I can probably I don't have a lot of sure I barely have new friends, but. I think there's at least one person I might be able to."
705.0,Provider,"It would be nice to have where while while you're expanding and it's just like Okay, you know, to have that support person there and you're going to make it to them and then you know. have to something maybe simple have a smoothie or something and then. Success big win."
11889.0,Patient,"Okay, so."
705.0,Provider,"yeah absolutely, so we will do that and then with the daily charts too, if one of them, you think is easier to fill out just fill it out and let's see if there's like a pattern you're on to to me the right track with medication Why not try it out, to see if it can help for right now. Okay, and then that way it gives you a chance to maybe acquire some more coping skills, because they'll bring down the intensity. might not be where forever, you need to be on them, it might be just for some months, why we get this going and seeing we'll reevaluate. Well, good and then, if you get from the virtual Center any type of like come to the virtual Center it's probably sorting out your group. And how you can start to go to that okay."
11889.0,Patient,Okay sounds good.
705.0,Provider,"Okay, and the last thing I always check off with two is just suicidal thoughts anything today or in the past."
11889.0,Patient,No i'm good.
705.0,Provider,"Okay, if ever there is there's the 988. Okay, always call bride heart health. Okay, then there's the 741741 is the text line to which is 24 seven you know if you don't feel like talking even just text them. Having a crappy day. And not text you back and forth."
11889.0,Patient,Alright sounds good.
705.0,Provider,"Okay, Sarah I look forward to seeing you then on the 27th I think we. put on the air and say 1130 yes, you got it. Thank you so much. I. Patient denies feeling suicidal no plan no intent, so the risk is no risk."
