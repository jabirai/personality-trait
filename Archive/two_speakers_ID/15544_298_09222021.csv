15544.0,Patient,Yes.
298.0,Provider,"Okay i'm going to tell you how to take it. abstain from any heroin for 12 minimum 12 hours 24 hours would be even better. With the suboxone you can i'm going to give you two strips i'm going to start you with two strips if you need another strip, let me know but. i'll see you on Mondays between one and three, you can cut the strips in half you'll need to use two strips for a 24 hour period, the first time you put it, nothing in your mouth. 15 minutes before or 15 minutes after let it completely dissolve under your tongue and then you can spit it out it doesn't do any good in your stomach you can swallow it, but it doesn't do any good, so the longer you let it absorb it in your mouth, the better. uh huh I wonder if you can do 15 minutes, even better, and you can cut your first time you use it, you can cut them the in half so you're using half a strip every four hours. While you're awake. If it throws you into precipitated withdrawals it'll be okay it just won't feel good. yeah yeah that buprenorphine is a strong medication and I will wipe off any opioids that are in your system and. It it's stronger than heroin, and so it takes over in the body so it's pretty strong medication i'm. It can cause a little cramping it can cause constipation so drink lots of water. i'll see you on Mondays between one and three, and I want to know that you were able to get your medicine, I i'm sending it over to the willow creek pharmacy. And i'm running your. pharmacy report. Right now. Okay. Do you have any questions for me."
15544.0,Patient,"What do you, what do you mean by you're starting off with two suboxone like. to tinker day."
298.0,Provider,yeah two films so it's the equivalent to 16 milligrams.
15544.0,Patient,Because when I was taking them. Without being discovered about usually take like three a day. So.
298.0,Provider,"Let me know that you got on the medication by Monday and i'll consider giving you three a day if I know that you are on the medicine okay. All right, alright Okay, you are good to go."
