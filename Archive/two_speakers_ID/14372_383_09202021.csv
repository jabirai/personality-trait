383.0,Provider,Do you have any questions for me. About therapy about the Program.
14372.0,Patient,"know because I fill these papers up all the time and it's pretty it's self explanatory. So, if anything, I had is pretty much answered, and if not, then I asked when I talk to somebody, which is quite frequently so."
383.0,Provider,Okay um are you wanting individual therapy.
14372.0,Patient,What do you what does that mean.
383.0,Provider,"Well there's the medication provider. Who, you know assesses your need and you discuss medications and she fills those prescriptions and then there's also individual therapy that where you meet with the therapist and kind of have conversations on on some of the things like we were talking about you know."
14372.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
383.0,Provider,You feel like you do want individual therapy.
14372.0,Patient,"yeah, but it is not the same thing as group."
383.0,Provider,"No it's one on one like our conversation today so there's group therapy. And visual therapy. And in a bright heart health, we have all of that, so you have group, you have individual and you have medication."
14372.0,Patient,i'm.
383.0,Provider,"more interested in it than others, so I just was. asking you, where you were at with that."
14372.0,Patient,"Well, it just seems like a you know. I would rather just have one i'm. I get overwhelmed like having group therapy and then having to talk somebody that i'm talking to somebody else like that that's a lot for me and i'd already sykes me out. You know what I mean, so I really just have one, you know what I mean like I got to talk to shontelle and then I got to talk to group, and then you that's a lie, and I get. i'm already getting anxious thinking about it, because that now that that's just it's a lot."
383.0,Provider,"yeah well. It is sort of how the program is set up, if you want. Fewer appointments with me."
14372.0,Patient,"Or can I. yeah, can I just do one of the other like instead of doing group just have one on one with somebody like you."
383.0,Provider,"um well not really I mean I don't I don't make the rules that with the program so they the people that make the rules are requiring people attend group once a week so it's one hour. Right one time per week which isn't a whole. You know isn't a whole lot and if you're doing better that can be reduced to twice a month, and you know it can even be further use down the road if you're doing a lot better."
14372.0,Patient,Some people operational okay.
383.0,Provider,"It changes over time, like as you do better, we and you and you feel like I know I don't need group every week, we can bring that down to every other week in terms of individual therapy, we can I can meet you once every other week that's kind of the standard and or once every three weeks."
14372.0,Patient,If you're.
383.0,Provider,"If you're attending group every week. We could meet once every three weeks if that feels better to you in terms of your meetings with chantel that's really important because that's your medicine, and so you know she usually sees people once a. Month also and but you see her regularly in in. Group to."
14372.0,Patient,"Okay. girl then. yeah then there's really no point, are you asking me if I want to do it or not, because no matter, I have to do it so don't matter what my end, you know what I mean so it's pointless of asking me."
383.0,Provider,"Well, because some therapy once a week and other people want really our APP right heart health to to get one on one therapy, so they want it once a week or they definitely want to every other week for sure that's why I wanted to know from you, you know. Where you were at with just the therapy piece there's the medicine and there's group, and those are Those are two other things, but just the fair."
14372.0,Patient,"Okay, so, then I can do therapy, so I can do therapy once every three weeks."
383.0,Provider,"We could start with that see how that works for you, if that's good if you're coming to group every week. yeah for now and i'm seeing we're seeing you in group weekly."
14372.0,Patient,down.
383.0,Provider,I think that we could work that out.
14372.0,Patient,Okay.
383.0,Provider,Okay.

383.0,Provider,"Okay, I just want to note that the beginning of this appointment, the recording was not on, so this patient is amanda when w E and tz, this is a bio psychosocial so just the first part of the appointment she's residing with her mother she feels safe in and outside of this home. She has graduated from high school and she was working as a forklift operator over one year ago she's not been on unemployment, the last year, she wasn't injured and there's some some kind of legal situation going on with regards to that interior perhaps it's already been completed. And she is applying for a job at Amazon. She is single no children and I don't exactly know when I pushed the button to record but i'll just go through a little bit about her parents father was arrested parents divorced when she was very young age, probably two. She has one brother and her father. She was mainly raised by her father's parents. And she would visit her father in prison. Mother remarried and then she moved to live with the mother when she was 14. And I think that, at that point, probably I turned on the recording. If not i'll make the edits in the can carry you. Thank you bye bye."
