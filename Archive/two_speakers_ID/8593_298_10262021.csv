When I was flipping my mom off and telling her what a bit she was, and I would never speak to him on like that, but I think it's really going back to when she used to beat me as a child. hmm and it's it's frustrating, and I really liked MGM and we didn't get to talk as much because, like the first one is more, you know, like questions as to. Just questions just fret burst and I liked her, and I think i'm having a really hard time telling my accounts or that i've been with for a long time that I it's time for me to move on. it's hard because it's like you it's like a friends. kind of. post to be just a friend they're supposed to you're supposed to feel like you're getting something out of it, you know. And i've been working on, you know fixing my relationship with my mom because i'm older now and so she and comes a point where you just gotta let go. You know, there is no parenting book and but but it hurts, and I was like the mother of my brother and sister my brother just turned 36 so. There was. 12 and 13 years so that's why I think I have another appointment Andrea. November 2."

8593.0,Patient,"hey look I know. Because I know Trent Alex will say section dolts is like $1,000 or something."
298.0,Provider,"yeah I don't know how expensive the sympathy access, but the combination. yeah I can play around with it a little bit more when we do it like this, because if you tell me something that makes me think we need to go up on your Prozac, then I can do that, but at least i'm getting you a little bit of zyprexa to break the depression. At night yeah."
8593.0,Patient,"How are ya I mean my dreams, or I mean. I just got to get what I wish there was something I could take that. Like like."

298.0,Provider,Today yeah.
8593.0,Patient,yeah scares me. That token so.
298.0,Provider,"here's the deal, I don't know what amounted is, you have to tell me what it is that gets rid of the dream, some people will take two milligrams and some people will take 20 milligrams to get their their ptsd under control, and so you have to tell me."
8593.0,Patient,"Do you remember you're getting a clonidine right. mm hmm so I don't remember you know I know i'm going to look at it, but i'm in the middle of. writing."
298.0,Provider,A prescription but tell me more tell me.
8593.0,Patient,"Okay, so you gave me clonidine and you only give me 15 which is fine, but it's not I mean it's helping me um. get to sleep, but not with a dream, so I don't know why I think I looked it up and I spelled it wrong, I think I got klonopin is what I looked up."
298.0,Provider,yeah I think.
8593.0,Patient,"I did, because it was but anyway, she gave me clonidine. yeah and. I don't know I don't know I can't tell you it's helped me with my dreams and that's really, what I want. You know. And maybe we could go up on the Prozac a little, because I do like that combination, I have to admit that was helpful for the crying and the only reason I cried you just now is because. i'm because i'm doing with some hardship, you know my hands in the hospital again and just i'm just. i'm just emotional."
298.0,Provider,Alright i'm going to take off the clonidine.
8593.0,Patient,yeah that's probably why you only give me 15 because you want to see ya and i'm going to go up on the Prozac.
298.0,Provider,"Because we were only at a starting dose just to see where you, you know if you can tolerate it in your stomach or had any problems. When when CAP now let's talk about something for anxiety in the daytime."
8593.0,Patient,yeah.
298.0,Provider,"What is your thoughts, what have you tried what's worked."
8593.0,Patient,"And I never really tried anything for daytime I don't think cuz my lorazepam I take it only gives me only one and I take it at night and. But OK, so they told me that I couldn't take, I think it was the clonidine and Suzanne anything they can't go together. The mean at the same time."
298.0,Provider,"yeah, I think, so we talked about it being a D to run 52 but i'm taking the clonidine away. So you're not going to get that anymore. And so."
8593.0,Patient,Right I swear i'm not lazy person.
298.0,Provider,No you're not. And don't even think like that. So tell me more about your anxiety.
8593.0,Patient,"Like i've had two episodes recently work I had one of my friend laura's and I just I had to get out of there, I had to get out of there. Was weirdest feeling I just was like I couldn't stand the space, I was in and I, and I called my mom you know because i'd had two beers. actually had like three beers but I don't know if that's what it was, but I call my mom and I said come get me like I gotta get out of here and she's like Okay, and then the second time happened not too long ago, and these are comfortable places like i'm comfortable with these people. very comfortable. So I don't know what was going on, then I had another one not too long ago at my cousin leah's and I took an uber. back because I would do not want to be there and her kids works, you are too young to stay alone, so I just took an uber which is fine. But I just I don't understand why i'm getting got that where I don't get these episodes you know, because you know I started thinking. Where my asleep i'm going to be woken up at an early time in the morning, I start thinking all these things and it's true, it is true if there's three boys underneath the age of seven you're not going to get much sleep and i've been my dreams are so like vivid how am I getting any sleep. yeah. i'm serious like i'm running in my dreams and it's like crazy and that and that's what happened today I woke up really tired. And went back to sleep, because I found out my was until 1230 that's how I felt I needed that to our knowledge that much."

298.0,Provider,"i'd love this struggle is. it's an Anti anxiety medication it's not controlled so it's not going to interfere with your advantage at nighttime. it's not going to do those things it's we don't know if it's going to be the right medication for you, it may give you dry mouth, it may not. It again we'll just try it and see if it is right, if it doesn't let me know okay."
