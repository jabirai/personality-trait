252.0,Provider,yeah they are they.
4146.0,Patient,"Oh yeah yeah but yeah she uses it for stress, because she has anxiety, you know social anxiety problem, but I have friends that also have in Korea phobia. So I can I can really understand where she comes from. So it's kind of it kind of works out pretty well because I can kind of talk to her and my son about different things that they're going through. And my wife tries to help, but certain things that are on that side, then you know my wife knows I have. Experience with it so. She sticks around she listens and. You know so she can understand what's what's kind of happening with her. You know it's it's good."
252.0,Provider,yeah it sounds good. Did you ever get the bull fish finished.
4146.0,Patient,"know I gave up, I had to want to cast me were. My car. And a simple little task that's taken me two days to take me a half hour, but you know i'm my body doesn't work that way so. Right she told me said Well now, what are we going to do with a pool she goes is this too much for you. And I just kept putting out of my head and and physically, it really is no and I had to come to that fact so. yeah but I did go now i'm getting students to come out and get it done."
252.0,Provider,Nice.
4146.0,Patient,I can't do it.
252.0,Provider,We can get to that point and let go a little bit and realize. You know what I mean how much smoother you know it's okay that you asked for help it's okay that you get somebody to come and help you. Your week it just means that you get a handle this big huge task on your own.
4146.0,Patient,"Definitely. been just working on my car, just like I said it with minor. And I still have our job I would have done in half hour before. and brightest. that's when things just clicked in with Monica talking to me in like you said she didn't put it, as you know well, you can't do this because you know you're not strong enough. yeah she just said, you know your your body can't do this anymore. You know, can you physically do this, you know worried about me, so I. I listened yeah Oh, it really does it really does. Especially when I know and she's. talking to me because she she cares."
252.0,Provider,"yeah and it's not point the finger or you know, putting you know, putting you down or making you feel bad you know. It really comes from a genuine place."
4146.0,Patient,"It does it does, we were we were discussing things with my son and his girlfriend the other day. But it was something that. I forget what the issue was but it. It had to do with her mom and how we would have done things back when we first got together and she was getting all upset and blowing things out of proportion and I put my arms around her and. I just looked at me to sit baby take five minutes and five seconds think back when we first got together with your parents. It was like it's like deja vu right here. You were watching the same scenario, now we know what your parents felt like. And then it'll all blow over it's no big deal we don't have to stress office and then everything was okay."
252.0,Provider,it's like oh yeah.
4146.0,Patient,"No, it was just taking that second just to stop for a minute and just. yeah pretty good and."
252.0,Provider,"yeah Those are the things that matter, those are the conversations that matter, the most you know. yeah definitely. That sounds like that everything is going good and that you're doing. You know, making all these changes communication is getting better. and your health."
4146.0,Patient,"yeah yeah health feel bad, but I deal with it yeah. i'm real cautious, what I do now. Just the fact that I died I don't know what my body is going to do yeah so I I just play things very safe."
252.0,Provider,idea.
4146.0,Patient,"You know, know before I was careless I mean I I wouldn't care if I started getting a seizure coming on I would try to fight it which it's you never win. Now I just I don't do anything if i'm not feeling well if I start getting sick I stop what i'm doing and I make sure what I come home. And Martha supported with it, you know once in a while she'll say, well, I wanted to do this, you know but grumpy dad and. Then, but everybody knows know that hey when it's time for me to stop it's time for me, otherwise I just find not going to be doing well."
252.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
4146.0,Patient,"It was really hard for me to because you get involved in things and you're doing things and then to stop it's it's hard. It i've been struggling with it, but i'm i'm doing it."
252.0,Provider,"yeah and that's what you got to remember you know, too, is. You know you didn't ask for this. You know, but yet you still have to take care of yourself and work within you know the certain boundaries with what's going on with you physically. And it doesn't feel good all the time. you're probably upset you pisses you off sometimes."
4146.0,Patient,Totally frustrating.
252.0,Provider,"yeah definitely but you gotta be kind to yourself and realize, you know. yeah just. How it is right now."
4146.0,Patient,"It is, it is, and I think with me and Monica working together on that because I catch her and because she's like me she'll overdo it. mm hmm she won't stop so when we do things the other day we were working in her room and I said okay we're starting to get tired it's just call it quits for today. And she baker back and forth, but eventually within 15 minutes, yes, she said okay that's that's good let's just let's just put things away. And then, but it was she was fine. she's okay to get back to it, the next day. Instead of laying up for the next couple days, but I told her hey this is extremely hard for me to go i'm learning this and, while i'm learning it, we can do this together. And that's how we've been kind of just doing things and I listened when she learns things to. I asked her what she learned and grew because we always learn different things. europe's different than my group, and so we learned different techniques and things are saying, but sometimes they're different. Let me share."
252.0,Provider,"that's good. Yes, yes, well, I look forward to good stuff."
4146.0,Patient,I learned a lot. By anything I could do to learn to make things better that's a positive.
252.0,Provider,"That is very much in it, you know even from the time they that we've started working together it's like. You know everything feels like it's just it's good it's getting better you guys, have you know little things that will little pebbles in the road that will come along, but you guys still are able to walk through them they don't turn into this big huge boulder."
4146.0,Patient,You know.
252.0,Provider,And so that's 25 years that's a long time. That is a long time.
4146.0,Patient,"i've been with my wife, for over half of my life. it's kind of amazing yes, it is very amazing. story better than I did when we first got together."
252.0,Provider,"that's important you know. yeah that's important forgiveness, is a big piece of it, and I think that's really what kind of destroys a lot of relationships, you know every religion goes through trials and tribulations. But if we don't. Forgive and learn from. Melbourne you know."
4146.0,Patient,"Exactly, then everything everything that we ever went through I mean it wasn't one of us."
252.0,Provider,yeah.
4146.0,Patient,"You know, we both had a part in everything."
