298.0,Provider,"hey Aaron, thank you for waiting."
2428.0,Patient,"yeah I got I think i'm gonna get rid of the screen protector, I was, I was trying to click on the link and it wouldn't. You know I it's only up there for a couple seconds, and if you don't click it it disappears so she had to put up like four times."
298.0,Provider,Time. I don't understand why some people have a hard time with that. I don't get it.
2428.0,Patient,"I think I have a live putting up a screen protector, I think. i'm going to maybe get a better quality one."
298.0,Provider,"yeah baby, how can I help you today."
2428.0,Patient,"um well, I think I should probably go over the. The issue i'm having with manny, I just wanted, I just wanted to talk to you before I talked to him. I know I have to talk to him. To get. An approval to get a different counselor, but I just want I, the reason I wanted to talk to you is. I know man, he says he doesn't take anything personally. uh huh, but I just I don't believe that and. I don't know if you know but. he's actually tried to get me out of the program before everyone got started. Back in I guess June."
298.0,Provider,When I was.
2428.0,Patient,"starting the Program. Well it's not his fault, I guess, but he was reading. Well, you know i've been in the program on like a year and a half ago."
298.0,Provider,yeah I remember.
2428.0,Patient,"So to him. It look I kept asking. compliance and all them to send a. urine test. mm hmm to him and look like I hadn't i've been avoiding taking one for over a year, so, then he he said he was suggested to to. You and everyone that i'd be removed, then he apologize for that he said he was reading the wrong date. But. I don't know if you remember, but like about three weeks ago, we were all on Group and I was trying, I was still trying to figure out why wasn't in the in the green. mm hmm and. One one reason was of course I didn't know that you were there, I was supposed to do the BAM surveys on Sundays. So, ever since then i've been doing them on Sundays, but he also even though him and I went off we went over all of this. He missed three meetings in a row back and. What happened is I missed Sep tember 14th my brother died on Sep tember 18th. And in that meeting, three weeks ago, he said, well you know you can't expect you to get back in the green when you missed all those meetings, just last month, I said. Well, what I said is that will that was months ago, and he said no, that was just last month he's he told me my brother died in the you know, in October. And I didn't want to like disrespect them in front of the group, so I didn't correct them but. my brother actually died way back in September that's when I missed the meeting and then. I just talked to the care navigator to confirm the dates and he canceled. So I missed Sep tember 14th and I missed a group. Then he canceled on September 23. October 7 October 21 and I didn't get to finally talk to him until November. 4 and he said. It also the care navigators said I was double booked on one or two of those and he was having trouble with his Internet which. On the fourth him and I went over and. He he acknowledged that. knowledge that those are on his and I thought he was going to put notes. You know, next to each one of those cancellations. But obviously he didn't put it in the notes, because when we had that group meaning he called me out in front of everybody, and said that I just missed all these meetings just in October. And remember that."
298.0,Provider,I remember that.
2428.0,Patient,"yeah and I didn't want to correct them or disrespect him are given to drama in the middle group. is just really rubbed me wrong that he. You know. We didn't get off on the right foot in the first place, and then. he's he's trying to tell me when my brother died and when what meetings I missed when he already acknowledged to me in a meeting that he was sorry for the three that he canceled in October, the end of Sep tember and the whole month of October. And i'm just i'm afraid, is going to get me expelled from the program one of these days and. i'm kind of afraid to confront him i've had a lot of anxiety about talking to him about it because I think he takes things very personally right. That one meeting when he called us cotton candy said we're talking about cotton candy and unicorns I felt like. I didn't believe for you, I saw so like that's not a guy that doesn't take things, personally, I mean. yeah I know afraid to confront them and, but I really would like a different counselor."
298.0,Provider,"I I think you would do so much better with a different counselor please don't I I worry about the recording on this one, but."
2428.0,Patient,"me, I will not, I will not drop your name at all."
298.0,Provider,i'm not.
2428.0,Patient,"like it. up on him I just it's so it's more of like if he does take it personally and tries to. pull some strings to get me kicked out, I just wanted you to to know."
298.0,Provider,"yeah so our boss, I was reviewed that meeting that we had my my boss reviewed the meeting and I wrote to my boss, and I said I think man he got his feelings hurt I think that's why it happened. And my boss wrote me back and said, I think it was that and i'm like I don't know so area, and I agree with you, I do think that there was he does his pride got involved in that situation and. I appreciate let you telling me how you feel, because I know you want to be here and I love, I want you to take it from this point of view when if, when you have that meeting with manny is. And people do this, all the time don't think you're different this way you would like to see what kind of. help you can get from a different provider like don't make it personal just say i'm ready for a different therapists it to see what I can learn from them, I put a spin on it like that, and we have people that say that all the time."
2428.0,Patient,"um yeah what really got me about that meeting, and like you know if i'm sorry your boss doesn't seem to see because manny seems to have a lot of people that say oh he's he's a good guy just give him a chance, and all this and I really don't know why he has so much. I don't know why he has so much support, I really don't get it, because. He seems like I think. It was his pride and his ego he jumped into that meeting. and Then, when he said okay we're going to make this a democracy, I think everybody was really too afraid to stand up to him and say you know what you're just being an a hole, because we were just talking about something that could have been very traumatic to. The guy you know he he jumped in when the guy was saying that his car got broken into and. it's going to cost him like $10,000 and I don't think that's I don't think we were talking about anything like. I don't know what that was about, but I do know when he said I don't take things personally usually, when somebody says that it's just the opposite."
298.0,Provider,"And the you know i'm. i'm a coward to like I have five hours a week with this man and I don't want to go up against him, and I did I did that day, I wanted to, I felt like he was being way too harsh and I didn't know how to help that situation because."
2428.0,Patient,"I don't like confrontation yeah I don't want to go up against them, either because. i've tried to gain support like through the care navigators and no nobody nobody has said anything like well yeah he they'd never agree with me like yeah he does kind of pull some weird things sometimes nobody would say that, and I was like. You understand why. yeah they're like oh just give him a chance yeah he's a good whatever and and then in our group. I really feel like there's people that are intimidated by him and they don't want to say anything and that's why, in the last group, the only thing I said, just in case it was being recorded was I said i'm just happy and I was just a happy surprise that this group, this week is different. I see you know. i'm also afraid to text people like you know i'm I was gonna text, some people in the group and i'm afraid he can read everything."
298.0,Provider,He can't we can't.
2428.0,Patient,Have a private message to like.
298.0,Provider,"No, we can't read it. there's not enough it's not even being recorded."
2428.0,Patient,I know Jared is sick of that guy.
298.0,Provider,yeah.
2428.0,Patient,"Jared just after that meeting, where he. So called called the democracy and we made a vote like Jared hasn't been the same i've seen a few people that have just really changed. They don't really want to talk they don't really want to talk now it's like really. he's kind of. intimidating. I don't know one thing else that bugs me is when we're on these one wonder when when him and I are in a one on one. i'm not allowed to ask him anything personal like i'd i'd like to know more about the person i'm communicating. And he knows. Why anybody know, not a single thing about who manny you know."
298.0,Provider,And you know I think that's because he comes from a background of corrections.
2428.0,Patient,she's. That explains a lot. Oh no worries such a hard ass.
298.0,Provider,"Naked that wasn't to share, but when I learned that."
2428.0,Patient,about where I will keep that to myself. But that explains that really explains a lot you. know I promise you I won't I won't repeat that. Now that makes sense because I what I thought was dang he must have really. fallen off the wagon at some time and now he's so diligent about being sober that he's like a drill sergeant. I thought. I thought he must have had a rough past in. The other direction. And then now he's.
298.0,Provider,Now he's.
2428.0,Patient,"On he's tough on. Tough on us because of what happened to him, but."
298.0,Provider,"yeah I don't know much more than that Aaron i've got to get going, is there anything that I can help you with anything else."
2428.0,Patient,well. I don't I don't get why he has so much Paul I mean he's just a counselor isn't.
298.0,Provider,"And, and you know what this happens every week that we change counselors from people because it's not the best fit and even if it was a good fit you might have already met. Everything that a counselor has already shared all their tools and you're ready for somebody else who has a different set of tools to teach you so try to go in it with an attitude of i'm just ready for a change."
2428.0,Patient,All Jeff i'm gonna i'm gonna be as like smooth as I can be to try not to give him get his feathers ruffled up.
298.0,Provider,yeah yeah and. i'm sorry that this happened.
2428.0,Patient,"yeah it's just it's a shame for the whole group really because now, I feel like he's leading it with an iron fist. Now it's like. Okay, you guys all decided to keep me around nobody spoke up because nobody did everybody was afraid to, and now that you voted me in. Now i'm in a rule it like an iron fist. it's with it went it went from bad to worse with that whole him just him letting us decide whether. How the group should be around and who should."
298.0,Provider,run.
2428.0,Patient,"It just made it worse, but. You know anything I was."
298.0,Provider,possible that we could get you a new group to.
2428.0,Patient,"yeah I was gonna try to do that, how many groups, so we, you have a four o'clock and eight o'clock."
298.0,Provider,"I do, I have a four o'clock where the therapist I would love for you to come to that group the therapist his name is chuck and he and he would be a really good match for you."
2428.0,Patient,"Okay, and he doesn't have too busy schedule and stuff."
298.0,Provider,um I don't think so I don't think so.
2428.0,Patient,But I shouldn't have form right.
298.0,Provider,"Well, you can ask for him tell him I talked to chantelle. chantelle recommends that I see chuck."
2428.0,Patient,Tell tell the care navigator.
298.0,Provider,"You tell the care navigator tell manny you can tell anybody, I think you would do really well in the 4pm group on Tuesdays. And Tuesday Tuesday for pm."
2428.0,Patient,"Now I know i'm not gonna I think I can do it without mentioning your name. and your yeah I wouldn't want to have all these groups with him and. and have any i'll just. i'll talk to the to him and request I get a new person and then, as if he releases me. or agrees to then i'll just ask for chuck with the care navigators."
298.0,Provider,"yeah and, if you want to run it by me at that point. Say run it by chantelle cuz i'll remember trust, but I will."
2428.0,Patient,"I appreciate that yeah because him and I went we went over all these cancellations and then he just suddenly you know it's like he turned on me in that group just same as. Well, you missed you missed all these meetings in your brother, and you know that was I said it was months ago it was months ago it was it was September the middle of September but i'm not the only other thing is. Just wanting to know i've been taking a route of film and a half to get going in the morning hi. And then I usually. When I have a seven day one, what i've been doing is just kind of running running out on the last day or two. But."
298.0,Provider,Why don't we go up.
2428.0,Patient,"yeah I was gonna ask you if we could because I actually for my weight it seems like i've been using a film and a half, so it's about it's about 12. Wait. 14 milligrams sorry. This is about what I use a day to get to come to a get me going in the morning."
298.0,Provider,"Okay Oh, I am writing that right now and. i'm. You are good to go, you can go get it at walgreens or whenever they say you can."

2428.0,Patient,But yeah I just I want this to be really private I respect that you have to work with this man. And i'm just glad i'm glad. That I have other options. I wish.
298.0,Provider,I wish.
2428.0,Patient,"I wish, she did. That. I mean, not to say you know there's one thing he did help me with, and that was. The one time he shared anything personal about himself was about his diet, because I told him I was struggling with my weight. And he gave me he told me the things that he takes as far as nutrition shakes and stuff like that, and it did help me lose a little weight and cut back on my sugar, but other than that he just seems like he doesn't even want to talk to me when we have our one on ones it's like. You know."
298.0,Provider,It seemed like he just can't wait to. check out. All right. Take care.
2428.0,Patient,Thank you.
