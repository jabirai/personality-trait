12002.0,Patient,This is l'oreal below.
298.0,Provider,I need to see your face I can put a name to the face.
12002.0,Patient,Okay. There we go see stranger how you doing.
298.0,Provider,"I am tired today, but thanks for asking. I think I just hit that afternoon. kinda Oh, and a nap would be nice."
12002.0,Patient,"kind of yeah it's almost a you know it's almost three o'clock it's almost the end of the day, show."
298.0,Provider,yeah yeah I haven't seen you in a long time.
12002.0,Patient,i've been in rehab for 30 days.
298.0,Provider,wow. What are your thoughts on that.
12002.0,Patient,"Well, I really didn't need to go, I mean because I haven't done any illicit drugs and I don't know pretty close to 10 years something like that. And so. But I did, I do have this court case and it involves my neighbor so I just you know, on. I just yeah I was doing a lot of prayer and meditation and then. The thought just kept coming up to me go to tarzana treatment and I i'm like you know that and i'm thinking to myself and i'm telling myself that's just kind of ridiculous since the. Since the simple fact is that I haven't done any drugs um but then I know that there's been people who. have been on the program that when they when they have, like so many years, you know, without drinking, the news and sometimes what they'll do is they'll just check into rehab just to get back to the basics. Because you know. something is going wrong, obviously, and so you know I. I guess, I was just feeling too much of the pressure from the case and knowing that these people, you know, most of the people here hate me they they just they don't like the fact that i'm gay like just you know it just disgusted with it sort of speak and so. I decided that. You know what I was going into this rehab thing and I went into it blindly. And so. So I just went and I did it and and all of a sudden, it is there was a reset button it got pushed. yeah yeah so I was like well i'm glad I came. Because I you know, like I said I went into it blindly and something just kept telling me and I thought it was ridiculous that you know. it's not coming you know go to tarzana treatment and i'm thinking to myself, you know worry that's just fucking ridiculous it's not a drug case, but then again i'm it got me back to some basics what I learned and it's what I needed. You know. So I I got a reset button pushed and I got some really good sleep, and you know I had taken my mentor and I talked to people about my situation which made it a lot easier for me to really cope with. So. So now i've been back I don't know how many days and. And i'm good."
298.0,Provider,Good good and um. I remember the Rayleigh was cost prohibitive and I guess it didn't get approved by your insurance.
12002.0,Patient,"Oh no it got approved by the insurance they. were like yeah it got it got eventually did get approved and so now, instead of it, costing 1300 it's costing and 75 bucks."

12002.0,Patient,No actually. i'm good really.
298.0,Provider,You look like you're in a different house the other one we used to talk to you was so dark.
12002.0,Patient,"um I probably have the lights on that's why. Plus i'm not sitting in this i'm not sitting in the same position, like, I mean, in the same in the same area I just switched. The area, because the windows are so old and fragile that you can hear everything, so I don't want to. You know, since I had problems with the neighbors I really don't want my conversation being overheard I mean you know the windows are 72 years old. So paper thin."
298.0,Provider,Their path and.
12002.0,Patient,"And I you know, like I used to tell the police when they come in and out, you know I used to tell him. These these windows, you know are so old that you know nothing's been done to this House, I mean it was built in 19 1942 I think it was. In my parents bought it in 1957."
298.0,Provider,Oh wow.
12002.0,Patient,"So you know we've had it for a long time, and just because of a lot of series of reports nothing ever got done to the House and that's really too bad. Because I mean this is a pretty nice area that I live in I just that you know my neighbors are homophobic and racist, so it makes it a little dark in this neighborhood even though everybody's white. I hear you know, like and so, but you know it's it's gotten, to the point where I you know because um. You know I did hear a lot of things coming at me and a lot of insults, you know, and I mean it provoked a lot of nightmares and people chasing me and things like that, and so I mean they made it very crystal clear that they do not like homosexuals at all. You know so. For me, this is a kind of a dangerous neighborhood even though it's. Even though the entire area is really good, but this. neighborhood is I don't know so but i'm hoping that you know laughter curl hopefully as coronavirus thing will clear up because i'm thinking about moving anyway. I don't I don't want to stay in the place where. Where my where I you know I don't know if they watch my every move, but you know there's just some things that happen when I leave the House that are unexplainable."
298.0,Provider,I have.
12002.0,Patient,"i'm. i'm not really sure what to do about it but i'm. I just have to take my time with it and see what happens because I have a feeling like i'm being followed sometimes. Oh, I leave the House and in its. In its you know. And i'm not trying to give it i'm not trying to give it not trying to give my mind something to focus on. By no stretch of the imagination, I don't want to make this situation very game what it is, I just. You know, there was just a couple of little incidents as well, we were driving that happen. my brother and I were I could swear that you know they were but I, you know, like I don't you know I don't go looking up the windows and like peering out the window and things like that I don't do that. Because even if they were I don't want them to know that I know. That came in yeah you know because. yeah you know they did follow me to the to the dispensary's. You know, they were throwing powder out of the window I don't know very many people that just you know throw powder and bond me out the window. When they're driving. You know I mean usually people clean their car they're stationary. kane till they're not driving with been me flying out the window. Because it was coming into the car and I could hear him cussing that fucking pitch locker and you know, I was like. You know. And they showed up at the dispensary when I turned around they were right there I could see him in line. They just started hitting that I didn't know who they were."
298.0,Provider,yeah it's possible that they popped up.
12002.0,Patient,"You know cuz I don't i'm not i'm not nosy. I really stayed in myself, you know I just I just happened to know that. I don't even know my my instincts are really fucking pain. They smiled so big in my face well in line, and I said lori there's something very wrong with those people right there. And when and then there was an incident where I did see some of the people, right here in front of my house, are you okay."
298.0,Provider,yeah I gotta fly yeah.
12002.0,Patient,"So you know so when I saw them in front of my house. I knew, those are the people that were that were there dispensary so. Anyway, so i'm trying to you know i'm not trying to give this any more attention it deserves. You know. Like in the Marina thing you know because yeah because you know for for all I know, because he would happen was the smell of somebody asked with powder came into the window, you could taste somebody asked what powder was gross. Gross. And my neighbors there's my my neighbors to one side of me or the grossest thing you'd ever want to live next to. I mean, I can I don't even want to tell you how bad the smell was coming from over there. But death warmed over smells like chanel number five compared to them. You know. So yeah. i'd rather smell a dead corpse. So anyway, but."
298.0,Provider,Okay i've gotta go and it's good to see you i'm glad you're back lori.
