15077.0,Patient,"um so I guess like especially well so i've had several different periods of weird eating periods, but I think like for the last year I think it's become a lot more apparent to me how. How little control, I really have over it, because I all attend to implement things on my own to do it, but I still catch myself and like very restrictive patterns, I guess is the words people use um. yeah cuz I that's The thing is, I had periods restrictive eating in the past, like in 2015 2016 like. I really definitely only like tomato soup, and like palella fruits unless it was like a group meal, with people. You know, and had a very intensive but it wasn't like that conscious was just like what I was doing it was what I could eat, I think, in general, like so I have pretty bad ADHD and then I also have complex ptsd which lisa's general dissociative and executive functioning skills issues. So I think, for a long time, a lot of my eating stuff. which I now i'm coming to terms of might be disordered, which is why i'm coming to y'all I think I kind of put off is like oh it's because of that. But then the more I would actually pay attention to the thing itself, I would notice or catch myself like like acknowledging I wasn't eating, but still not eating. Pretty consistently in a way that was like conscious, but then I was like oh this doesn't really match okay understanding, I have."
120.0,Provider,"So, what are you eating now. Like like right like on a regular basis, today, like during this last week, what kind of like what are you eating."
15077.0,Patient,"Today I actually did my tried to make real food Oh, my goodness did to read and then I put kale and tomato and baked in and put it with honey mustard. yeah usually. yeah sounds good, but the thing is they actually is so i'll do that occasionally but it's like, on average, though it's like quite typically it's like I don't need to 11 and if I do it's like the yesterday to 11 and I had only eight two pairs. I eat a lot of like. i'll go to the bodega need like an egg and cheese avocado be like what kind of protein. mm hmm but it's like usually I won't eat like a big meal to like the end of the day, I can go the whole day basically eating very little and often even when I eat all the like half meals alive."
120.0,Provider,"Okay, so sporadic it sounds like."
15077.0,Patient,"I mean via yeah I was also simultaneously, I will definitely have periods of like just straight up like. More or less like starving myself, but like."
120.0,Provider,"Is that can you said that you kind of do that, but it was kind of just you forget."
15077.0,Patient,"or just not be conflict so like in the beginning it was like that, but then in reflection I don't actually think it was like. That if. You know. Okay, because there are just be times, especially in the last i'd say six months. Where I would be more hyper aware of just like i'd be like oh my stomach is very hungry, I feel it rumbling and then I just completely ignore it very purposefully."
120.0,Provider,"And do you know why you're doing that, or why you would be ignoring it."
15077.0,Patient,"I think it's been a combination of a lot of different feelings different times, sometimes it's like oh I don't feel like cooking right now and i'm like making and it just feels like this insurmountable. lock like the idea of doing it feels like impossible and so. In the past it or I feel like oh I don't know actually maybe I want food right now, even though my body's saying food my brain is like you don't really want food right now. mm hmm um it's a lot of just like putting it off until honestly it's like i'll put off eating until I fucking snap and I get angry and then I have to eat."
120.0,Provider,mm hmm.
15077.0,Patient,"Do you know what I mean and that's. But that's not a way you can like nutritiously feed your body, and the reason i'm dealing with this now, instead of you know, maybe just continuing to ignore it, so I had a medical diagnosis session ongoing a medical process for elite stainless syndrome."
120.0,Provider,Can.
15077.0,Patient,"there's a connection a connective tissue disorder a genetic disorder. yeah with that I need to start doing regular exercise like philosophy is to recondition my muscles. So that my I won't develop arthritis and stuff that is, I know I have restrictive eating patterns enough because it's also the point where I mean i've been trying. To just instead of looking at is like Oh, maybe I have a disordered eating issue, I was like Oh, maybe it's just my relationship with food as a whole. You know, maybe it's a you know, or maybe it's my inability to the grocery stores because it's exhausting maybe it's this maybe exact. And each time I tried providing it like I got a grocery service, the food will just rot and then they feel guilty, you know. Like it's yeah so it's like it, but the thing is i'm realizing like why can't exercise every day if i'm like not eating enough that's gonna kill me if I don't not even purposefully."
120.0,Provider,"But what do you imagine as being what recovery with look like, for you. Like what, what do you kind of feel like you're shooting for."
15077.0,Patient,cool to just. have to think about food.
120.0,Provider,Okay. So do you see yourself like eating like three meals and three snacks every day I don't want to schedule.
15077.0,Patient,"I mean yeah it would just be cool to know, meaning like and not feel so stressed out about it because. i'll just get really stressed out about it and, like sad that it's so hard do and I already know a lot of like i've been in trauma therapy for years, and I do think that there's a lot of. Internal roots in my relationship with food, and maybe like just like cooking and eating as a whole that was impacted by like family. You know so."
120.0,Provider,A lot of trauma.
15077.0,Patient,"Like i'm coming in completely blind to myself, you know any mean but it's more just like it's like i'll just know this for me it doesn't make it easier to do it food. Right right. Like."
120.0,Provider,"Have you ever worked with a dietitian. No Okay, so you haven't ever tried that Okay, and your outpatient therapist is it sounds like a trauma therapist is that."
15077.0,Patient,"kind of she's great she does have a trauma, especially. I found her on this thing called Manhattan alternative okay. A few years back she's a trauma special teams she also has like a focus on like queer and like sex recurring King friendly therapy so she's really open minded and cool but she's limitations with like eating never focused, you know so. yeah the last like gear, I definitely. tried to be like and it's helpful for cuz she is great I don't want to sell you know, but you know, but she only can do so much for. yeah yeah."
120.0,Provider,"Because all therapists you know kind of have special things that they focus on and sounds like you have pretty good support for the trauma piece. But this part, you know that that's why I suggested the dietitian because you know that that sounds like that's really what you need is. Somebody to help you make food choices and give you some direction as far as you know, making food and structuring food, you know because it sounds like you're overwhelmed and that part of that might be ADHD too is I can't make a decision, because it's."
15077.0,Patient,"So many things yeah and I haven't been medicated for ADHD since high school so. Okay well yeah because I had went to like this weird school where I didn't know if I would have because I had to travel I didn't know if I have access to medication I. mean because it was of my general interest it wasn't actually hard to focus on the school element like like high school was like. yeah well all over the frickin place so but I was like and then as i'm a writer so. i'm able to write about what I want to write about i'm an editor or you know, even though I will admit even that has become overwhelming some of medicated lately, but I have thought Oh, maybe that's. A part of the food thing, but then i'm like it could be that, I mean I feel like it's a mixture of a guy, I guess, a lot of things."
120.0,Provider,mm hmm.
15077.0,Patient,"Because I just don't even feel like. I want to think about the relationship, I have a female looks was very. tainted by like my dad and his here like a control of the kitchen. did a really big way like I couldn't. I couldn't make it a win against what he would have I was like. Well, I was making an egg and he came downstairs and I have been told to my dad in two years, so just like he came above like me and just started critiquing the way I was cooking in a, even though I lived out of home at that point, the feed myself."
120.0,Provider,Sure well.
15077.0,Patient,"No, it."
120.0,Provider,"makes sense, why that would kind of mess, with some of your experiences around food when associated with that kind of stuff sure. yeah so you've never had any specific treatment related to an eating disorder, but you have with trauma and it says there's a lot of trauma going on."
15077.0,Patient,"yeah i've done a lot of trauma therapy and. eating, just like the one time that I can definitely look back and like be like okay that was definitely a period of like. Pretty disordered eating and stuff like that it was also like during it came about during my first see ptsd episode that when I was 19. And it's like I quit drinking because they realized there was drinking too much, then I quit eating around that time to kind of I don't even know at that time it felt like maybe a control it wasn't like I felt that it was never that was like I just didn't exist at the time. Right so it's like I just didn't want to. take up space, and it would be you know. Around than eating is obviously."
120.0,Provider,"You know, and part of that."
15077.0,Patient,"Sure yeah But then when I got home, it was world, so my whole family was to secure so tiny are so tiny and it's ironic, because you know you think like. On you needed to gain weight would feel like lovey. But it really does it what it's like wow What did you do is like. You know. This kind of feels harder."
120.0,Provider,"So you're so your food restriction now I just wanna make sure i'm understanding it's it's more about kind of. It sounds a little bit like disorganization like you don't have the the energy or the mindset, to try to help your to eat to feed your body and but it's not about trying to lose weight."
15077.0,Patient,No.
120.0,Provider,Is that correct.
15077.0,Patient,"Okay care about losing I never count calories in my life. I don't okay scale, unless I go to a doctor. Okay, because, like from a very young age, was like my my weight just has fluctuated a lot dependent on my overall sense of things, but yeah it's like I guess I just didn't even want to think of it as disordered it's a whole yeah whatever."
120.0,Provider,"Okay, how do you how is your body image, do you feel satisfied with kind of how your body is right now."

When I try Maybe other days, where I have enough energy to cook I even will spend a stupid amount of money ordering food it's like all end up only half of it and it's like never figured already been it's like. i'll go through periods. Like a few weeks right i'll try to be really active and I would try after I noticed, maybe earlier, the year. There was a few months period where I wasn't trying at all, it was very just restricted, but it was very that's why I try but it's like I guess that's why I finally just reached this point where it's like i've been trying to turn to like figure out how to get to yeah. How to like. deal with it, yet already be. yeah and it's like and it's I don't know if I can use oh."

15077.0,Patient,I mean if you're looking over the last five years and. 20 minutes i'm going to just go about it yeah my highest weight to my memory was like 145 around.
120.0,Provider,"Okay, you know when that would have been."
15077.0,Patient,"I think that was my freshman year of college and I was I lived with like a house family, I was in Costa Rica and they like fed me every day, every day."
120.0,Provider,And they can take care of you that way yeah.
15077.0,Patient,"yeah and then the next year I was in China that's what I started that's from the all the ED stuff popped up, I guess, and then from there it's like I kinda would I don't know. My the ability to feed itself, it just was it was always being kind of like I would either go out a lot to you or them occasionally I would cook a meal or like. Never consistent and then. kind of sad it got worse."
120.0,Provider,"and has your are you at a low weight, right now, or as your weight been lower or do you even know."
15077.0,Patient,hundred 11 that's pretty low I suppose. yeah probably not as low as it's been.

15077.0,Patient,I think like. 106.
120.0,Provider,"Okay, and was that recently, or when was that."
15077.0,Patient,It was definitely the last six months.
120.0,Provider,"Okay, so recently okay yeah mostly. yeah okay um. let's see and I had, how do you feel about like I know your your weight your feeling is is very low, and it sounds like you have some pretty poor body image around that if you feel the same about your image about like your shape things like that, like you, obsess about that. or you're not thinking about it that much."
15077.0,Patient,"I mean when I was a kid I definitely notice that I stretch marks on my thighs really early, which is apparently eds thing very common to have stretch marks are in places that don't make sense, did not know that. I know interesting but I mean honestly. I did have substantive even not necessarily regards to my physical parts, so I should give you a big contact so growing up my dad was a pedophile. And I grew up like living with him, I mean there's a three year period, he wasn't other house, which is when I became aware, he is a pedophile but that after he had a stroke, he moved back in. And now it's an agency like 1418 i'm like 30 and I can't even remember but due to that I was always hyper where my body. of covering what it looked like what it did look like what it should look like what it could look like. But it wasn't so much of an active me wanting it was I would rather a thought of my body is not being a thing. Right I didn't want to attack and have a form. Because it was like. You know."
120.0,Provider,Right.
15077.0,Patient,So I did that make sense.
120.0,Provider,"Okay yeah i'm. Do you have any current food rules like certain foods that you're afraid of, or will you eat pretty much anything it's just hard to get yourself to eat."
15077.0,Patient,"thinking. I mean it's like i've had periods of different rules also periods of different like only eating certain things and cycling two different meals. i'll do that a lot, but like. I definitely when I was a kid I wouldn't eat ravioli because I threw up after shift, or do you fall on time at two gears to maybe it's for me to try."
120.0,Provider,yeah you get the link because i've seen that people like. People have thrown up fruit loops making every again or something you know just because we have these associations yeah.
15077.0,Patient,"Right, I mean it's just it's just a fact right like. Your brain is how it is right and then. Thinking though I mean there are definitely other things and I thought. Okay it's."
120.0,Provider,"not like, if I get really freaked out by food if it's anywhere close to the expiration date. Okay, so nervous about that."
15077.0,Patient,I enabled I can't oh i'll I care if I think something's even close to being off I throw it out.
120.0,Provider,"Okay, but like if I gave you like an ice cream sundae or something you'd be like Okay, you would be scared of it or thinking it was."
15077.0,Patient,"No, I wouldn't be scared of it, I might not eat the whole thing, but I would accept it with right manners."
120.0,Provider,"Right right okay okay um and then, as far as like psychiatric history, you mentioned complex between."
15077.0,Patient,"I don't need your fish. I sorry I don't eat meat or fish but that's. A little different but I guess that is a dietary it just I haven't done it since I was 12 so. At this point, it's not even like a conscious thing. Okay, so. God, I should mention that before we moved on."
120.0,Provider,"yeah no I appreciate you mentioning that and. I so for other mental health conditions, you mentioned PT complex ptsd and ADHD. And, can you tell me what else what other things you struggle with. Lawyers out the."
15077.0,Patient,symptoms of that.
120.0,Provider,"Well, I guess, if you like, if you do have any other diagnosis is that you."
15077.0,Patient,"I mean, I have thought about the possibility of bipolar before, but I don't actually know if that's true it's really hard to tell. Because I am very Moody but that could also be trauma."
120.0,Provider,yeah.
15077.0,Patient,"Absolutely just or just being a sensitive person and definitely very sensitive. But I also because, like i've trained myself. on how to communicate my feelings and not project them because i've done i've done a lot and a lot of self work. So it's good that it's not at the point at this point anymore, I feel like a really heavily impacts my relationships, but in the past, I think it was a lot harder for me. To have communicative healthy relationships of boundaries like I did teach myself that like I was never taught as a child. So it's like it's hard to say because a lot of my behavior I look at that i'm like oh some of that really stuff could look like this, but now that I worked through a lot of I don't feel I have as much of that anymore, you know any mean."
120.0,Provider,"managed differently sure yeah Okay, is to have you ever been diagnosed with borderline."
15077.0,Patient,"Lol some horrible therapist I saw one time in China, because he was the only English speaking therapists around. One time, who also told me, I had a victim complex after again after I went to him after i've been assaulted which was."
120.0,Provider,About cheese.
15077.0,Patient,"diagnose me a bb D and I was like that doesn't feel accurate I don't split on people. Because that's the thing I know tons of people be PT I have no judgment towards it, I know it's a very stigmatized thing you know by don't think for me, it makes sense because i'm not one to split and be like oh you're evil suddenly it's someone you know and be like your early. Right it's like I i'm just a very traumatized and I have my own traumatic. reaction associations to things but it's like i'm able to lodge in the work that because I can be like oh wait that's like. eight year old me. Talking right."

I only have companionship rifle very valued. But I think in the past, I would definitely and I not even just in the past, I mean, I still occasionally fall into moments of spiral sex bingeing I see.

You know, obviously I wouldn't wish on anyone, but I did learn a lot but due to that situation, I can cry for a while and I remember, I did purposely take shrooms to let it out, and that was actually very healing.

I just feel like only this past year, we finally been able to have like a real relationship. Especially because my kind of my dad she initially didn't understand it at all, because so much the shift from our family was hidden from her so it was like you know, taking the little egg and hatch the cracking it open not."
120.0,Provider,"Right, you know."
15077.0,Patient,"And then my older sister, and I have we have a very complex relationship, but we are a lot better in the last year as well, thankfully. She had been at a really abusive relationship for a few years, so I really thought I lost her there and then she finally left in this past year, but now she lives at home with my dad and my mom and her three kids she has and it's like going from one tyrant to another.

15077.0,Patient,"mean we do I mean inevitably cutting out my dad a stranger me in many ways for my family, even if I was talking to them because. I couldn't come home, and when I did go home I didn't say at home, obviously I say you're my best friend Rachel but then I only saw them in certain contexts right said, everyone see my dad and. They were lovely respectful of that, but you know I mean yeah like it, there were levels of a stranger with all of them, to some extent due to the fact that one I went to like a weird school right just. I got the Fuck out of United States I just like travel for four years, they stayed in New York or far away."
120.0,Provider,"Where do they live, where do you go to college so. where's your family live at. Oklahoma oh so you are really far away, then okay."

And he also is anger issues, neither of them are alcoholics but they both chain smoke cigarettes mama mama equip and my dad's still still chain smoke cigarettes and. Even though he had a stroke, I remember actually I remember the day we went into the hospital and he stroke my mama was like it's something like Karma. wow no I mean, but those three years, my mama kind of we were very codependent. I thought I was very close to my mother until I cut out my dad and I realized oh wait actually like. If I walk outside of this family dynamic of like torturous pain and actually call it what it is. I mean it's showing the relationship, and I mean until kind of my dad two years ago was until maybe very, very, very recently, I even got a hit of a conversation my mother acknowledging my dad is abusive."
120.0,Provider,wow so your mom is still pretty denying of it.
15077.0,Patient,"yeah even though she knows it but she's like what to do, because it's also a financial thing it's like I grew up fucking why trashes like she can just get out of them."
120.0,Provider,You know versa right.
15077.0,Patient,"So that's another I mean, I have a lot of guilt on that too is i'm feel like i'm living this fake life in New York, where like."
120.0,Provider,"How did you how did, how are you able to go to Costa Rica and China that's awesome."
15077.0,Patient,"Oh well, basically, so I went to a small global studies program and it was all on fucking well I paid for my own flights, because I worked on the summers. And then, basically, the actual thing was all through the school. So I was on scholarship and debt."
120.0,Provider,Okay okay.
15077.0,Patient,"Because, then they would give stipends and then I also got a job in college, where I was a social media manager I almost started doing sex work in China, but then a person shamed me about it, so I didn't. But you know I struggled throughout the time you know any mean, I was very lucky to run into a lot of amazing people who didn't have more money than me and weren't like stingy about it and we're very helpful and Nice. and recognize I came from different circumstances and so her you know when the when I got to New York event versus working in restaurants, I rose I can I can afford to live here on restaurants, I mean this is. A graduate of per semester, I was, I was working Shaw shores, I had. The last semesters college was in New York and ricky is john George had an internship was working full time with my thesis was insane. And then I also just like was heartbroken and my grandma had died my ex girlfriend broke up the the first week I moved there just horrible time. And then I realized after that, like Okay, I definitely can't afford to live here just they did I put that restaurant, I was working a different one that just sucked. And that's why I ended have this extension and, eventually, and that was abusive as Fuck That was a 10 month abusive Labor situation, I am not saying sex work is inherently abusive i'm saying this inherent dungeons abusive. that's priceless. I want to be very clear, because you know, then I later on, like what independent and i've had amazing experiences, when I was independent and then. You know I became a freelance journalist, because they covered like the sex workers rights be. not letting me become an owner, and all this stuff so you know, I have no regrets, and it definitely radicalize be a full time by at the same time, it was like that's how I could afford to live in New York was out doing sex work is like I didn't have a trust fund and have what long. Time. I was in the back of lucky dogs, this is this is barred williamsburg. All devices out there. And I was dating producer from Vice so we were like hanging out there. talking to these two Dudes and they were like yeah just started referencing their trust one's really, really know, and I was just like looking at."
120.0,Provider,"me like wow yeah no I well I straight up sentence i'm like wow you know it's afford to be a journalist, all I had to do is piss on old men for money but that's kind of the same thing and."
15077.0,Patient,"These two men like just like man. that's because I was just like you know, and I have no shame and because it's like why I had to do and now i'm in a different situation, I have a book coming out i'm in a good place. And a lot of ways. But it's like I had such a hard and that's The thing is, why I felt like I feel like i'm gonna fake life now like I have all these new people love me and care for me and know me is. He But then when I went home, it was so hard because, like just even being around my family for like fucking 10 days I literally regressed into my most deep horrible void thought of myself, which is just like white trash pedophiles daughter. That is human we are. You know, and so it's like I it's really good to be away from home, you know I love them it's like I can't spend any time with without regressing really hard in. Your roles and you know any. mean it's it's difficult it's complex."
120.0,Provider,yeah absolutely absolutely and were you ever in foster care like did anyone ever investigate anything going on.
15077.0,Patient,"Well, they did, but no, so what ended up happening was. This is actually what I will usually typically refer to as my route trauma. was when I was 11. CPS which was through DHS in Oklahoma at the time."
120.0,Provider,mm hmm.
15077.0,Patient,"investigated my dad and he had to be kicked out of the House at that time because they were basically like you can either lose access to your kids or have him leave the House. And, but that apparently an investigation only lasted three months because they couldn't find enough, is what they said. or whatever so what's hilarious is I found out coming home i'm pretty sure the people that report to the release family, friends of ours, I thought were really good friends and my parents little time and then I realized sweet know y'all were to be on all of us. I actually had conversations with them, it was very clear that they were the ones who they think my sister went to them, it was like my dad like showed me ancestors pornography wine coolers and try to touch me, and then they really have delegates that like it like. This moment you know yeah wow wow."

They misuse was over so actually when all of that happen, I knew she had been harmed, so I was actually were martyred like I was like for her, I was angry, for her I didn't. There was no context for me and even though I was angry at my dad it was like oh you're a pedophile I knew this in my head about him. No one came back into the House, it was horrible because I was aware who's a pedophile knew he was in the House knew all of these things, but also use my father and he was crying he just had a stroke and can't watch an episode criminal minds are crying now. And I had to take care of him. But I also was constantly wear clothes that are too big for me or hiding my body and anytime my dad that any like I remember before I went to prom You said this comment about like oh boy I was your age I dance with you, and maybe if he was a normal dad that comment would be fine.

120.0,Provider,But yeah that's what that's why I was like what's kind of your idea it's kind of goes into yeah I also make me and I have a trauma diary actually if it's helpful for you.
15077.0,Patient,"it's called ATM feed. it's um it's actually do you know, like you know that book The body keeps the score. yeah the guy who wrote that even I know apparently he's fucked up to his workers, I have heard that which is disappointing. really was shown my means my this. guardian writer who is writing about means of trauma means and he liked them. But, so I like be. But the thing is my name is are also very much they're not necessarily a hobby anymore, either because I have a lot of like I call them my trauma babies. Because you understand i've been doing my shift for a while, you can tell i've reflected a lot, I clearly have a lot of stuff i'm still working through and I won't deny that but i'm not like some people where they are they're fresh in the scab you know and. Taking it off. And so I have a little more perspective so i'll make these means about my experiences, but kind of like diary for that I have a lot of people that like so it's, not that I it's like a job, but even if I don't pose people know or like you know so it's not really a hobby anymore either. kind of like an on practice, if anything, and so. um what do I do I scroll Twitter. Lol I love playing this hymns I like video games I love escape is I watch TV and film, obviously, but also, I want to work in those so there's those two but I mean I also do use them simultaneously for escapism I like going arts, I like hey you know friends."
120.0,Provider,"So you're pretty good social social network of people that care about you. Oh definitely awesome awesome. Do you think it would help if you engage with some of your friends to help you eat like to eat to remind you to eat or eat with you, or that sort of thing."
15077.0,Patient,"I mean, maybe."
120.0,Provider,"I just had a I had a client yesterday. That I will send her phone went off and we were in session and she's like oh yeah and she said because her friend. put some reminders in her phone to eat and so she pulls out her granola bar, you know, and I was like good for you, you know because she was forgets and she doesn't feel hungry, a lot of time and then she wonders why she gets angry later, you know."
15077.0,Patient,Right yeah.
120.0,Provider,"sounds a bit like you and but her friends kind of helped her do that, because then they can help her hold yourself accountable and stuff."
15077.0,Patient,"No, I mean ED eats with be or where to go. with other. People I tend to I tend to be good with eating, because I think they need to eat."
120.0,Provider,"yeah yeah well and it can be a social thing for sure to you know. So yeah well that's that's the main stuff I have for you, I have to talk to treatment team that's The next step, and then I mean the only the main, the main thing, I think that they might have an issue with is that you haven't met with a dietitian yet. Now patient. Because generally in order to get like or to do I O P it's considered like you know it's a step up, but you haven't been able to get help at this level first really. yeah and so have you ever tried to find a dietitian like an eating disorder dietitian."
15077.0,Patient,know and I didn't really admit I had a problem to last week.
120.0,Provider,"Right right, this is all really new for you yeah so."
15077.0,Patient,You at least accepted look at those terms right like I felt like.
120.0,Provider,"It sounds like to me that it's very trauma based and. A little bit detached from yourself where you're not recognizing the need to eat. You know, and so it's not that you're. consciously well, maybe a little bit, but that you're consciously trying to restrict food in order to lose weight, because you actually want to gain weight."
15077.0,Patient,What you're telling me I don't want to lose weight.
120.0,Provider,"Right right, and so I think that a dietitian could that could say here, this is what I want you to eat and give you kinda like a meal plan, I think, can really make a difference for you like, I feel like I O P could be an option, but I think it that you what you need is more of the basic. Guidance around food."
15077.0,Patient,You know.
120.0,Provider,"And somebody that kind of will meet with you, maybe more often and be able to check in with you and say you know help you follow your meal plan, especially if you could do it in person, that would be awesome. yeah I know they exist, I know they're there there's a couple of different. Like like the website, you talked about that you found us on that or dietician websites and that says like what a special and whether it be like eating disorders, or like. You know people who are on like IV fluids, or people different specialties like diabetes things like that. Because they are different in in how they approach things, and so you might need somebody that knows how to manage. Food with emotions because it's not just about food it's about your emotion, with it, so that's what i'm thinking that they're probably going to say or recommended he first and and check that out first."
15077.0,Patient,you mean to go to someone else entirely.
120.0,Provider,"yeah to get a dietitian first, whether it be through what asked her through somebody else before we jump to this because a lot of the iot is I. titian through y'all possibly I have to look and see I don't know if we have anybody in New York, I have to look at that, but."
15077.0,Patient,that's the thing it's just so hard to find people with insurance stuff.
120.0,Provider,"Oh, I know I know that's the pain in the butt is with that what is, what is your insurance."
15077.0,Patient,Blue cross blue shield's.
120.0,Provider,Okay.
15077.0,Patient,it's the normal kind.
120.0,Provider,"Okay, so i'll i'll tell amanda that because she that's part of her job is to help hook people up with resources, you know part of my job is to figure out what is probably going to be the most effective approach and and then her job is to kind of figure out where those things are. In your area, you know cuz you know we're all in different states and so. I don't know what you have in your area and you don't either, because you haven't you know it's it's a new it's a new world for you right now so i'll chat with her and our treatment team and then we'll we'll get back to you. about some I some plans going forward."
15077.0,Patient,Okay sweet.
120.0,Provider,"it's been great getting to know you and. Your your I love I love that you're a writer I would love to see you write a book like you know you're writing poetry, but like just no people have amazing stories. about their lives so. alright."
15077.0,Patient,"Good one, so you. know from amanda basically if, like."
120.0,Provider,yeah we're.
15077.0,Patient,gonna recommend a dietitian and then.
120.0,Provider,"yeah like if I think that's probably what we'll do, but then she'll come up with like some resources for them, because I know that you don't know how to find one. Okay now. you're you're."
15077.0,Patient,"not going to get like additional therapy, those are masking it's just going to. Go to a dietitian."
120.0,Provider,"was already well since you already have the therapist and they used to they're not ED special specialized. Yes, I honestly think that a lot of your food stuff is trauma related."
15077.0,Patient,I mean.
120.0,Provider,"To me, I think that's the root of it is trauma because almost everything you said had to do with trauma. ya know and it and, and I think that the dietitian could hit the food piece, as far as you know, just managing food choices managing schedule managing meal plans to make sure that your body's getting nourished and I think if and then the trauma piece your therapist. could really you know because i'm sure they they. If they're a trauma therapist i'm sure they will talk to you about body image stuff in context of trauma."
15077.0,Patient,Because I don't care anything about like disordered eating.
120.0,Provider,Well that's what a dietitian is for you know they but we could also look for an. Eating disorder dietitian I mean eating disorder therapists in your area also.
15077.0,Patient,yeah.
120.0,Provider,there's sometimes there's too many cooks is kind of the problem you know.
15077.0,Patient,I get you.
120.0,Provider,"That that's kind of a thing too. Because I just wonder like I just think that if you could figure out how to. You know cuz communications are there be rock they're amazing if you get a good one, that understand like they'll tell you kind of what to eat and then talk to you about how you feel about it, whereas like. A dietitian that deals with like diabetes isn't going to ask you that you know they don't care what you feel about it there's conflict with eat. But what a dietitian that was eating disorders are going to help you deal with what are the roadblocks and getting food like do you get anxious, do you get like I don't want to like you said i'm too tired to go cook i'm to like I don't have motivation to go to the store. yeah those kinds of things. You know, in that, in that be related to I don't feel like I deserve it, I don't feel like. I know I mean it could be a an unintentional self sabotage. ya know and those are those cannot be trauma related to you know. Since so it's a very complex issue, obviously, but, but you, I can tell you that a lot of work on yourself, which is to be commended that's great so. alright. Well we'll we'll be in touch later than. Right so okay alright see ya bye bye. So for. she's a very complex person ADHD for diagnosis of ADHD ptsd. I don't really know what the other as far as the eating disorder, I would say. The unspecified feeding or eating disorder, because I don't really it doesn't really fit all of those categories. So just put unspecified for now, and I will. edit if, when when I go i'm going to talk to Catherine about it, to make sure that i'm getting the right category, because that one's kind of a little bit squarely. So, and I think I don't have enough information to be able to really diagnose ppd, but I do think it probably exists, but she mentioned ADHD and ptsd which I think definitely is a reality so. So let's just do that and then maybe it she probably has a mood disorder, but i'm like. Like undifferentiated not specifically differentiated. i'd have to do a little bit more about that because I don't think it's I mean she might have some like mild depression, I would think so so. Because I looked at her scores, and I said well Sir i'm thinking out loud so mild depression, so why don't you put let's put mild depression. And then ADHD ptsd and then unspecified for the eating disorder."
