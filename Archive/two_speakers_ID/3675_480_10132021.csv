3675.0,Patient,How are you.
480.0,Provider,hi how are you.
3675.0,Patient,"Oh good, I guess, I remember I don't know."
480.0,Provider,"what's going on, do you know I can't see you."
3675.0,Patient,"Not another. Sorry, I must have hit. I had to. I had to quit the program to be able to do my therapist."
480.0,Provider,What. Because.
3675.0,Patient,"All right. I moved up. i've just moved again I got mom place or. Sean Burke is hey oh. You got your own place yeah but I made your $3 copay right. yeah what from the week before remember um. Because remember you have messaged me I don't I had a problem with my cord, and I never paid it. So that's why I missed last night's because I didn't have the money, I was gonna lie and say that my. That that phone service have went down and I didn't have my data book book i'm just going to tell the truth, I didn't have the money, so I miss gruden. and This is the third time that they've done this to me where they won't will let me see you, even though I pay my $3 credit for you, I have an outstanding $6 balance and they wanted me to pay the whole $9 just to be able to see."
480.0,Provider,yeah.
3675.0,Patient,"So understand they can't get their mind you know, unless I make my copay and all that. But i'm making the effort, I am making my payments, just because I don't have it on my core right this minute you know cuz i've put it up there as needed. So it don't get wiped off by. Nothing because I can't afford that. and So, every time I do something I have to go to the bank put the money up there. And so only had. Only put $3 after I had $3 and 54 sent out there, that I put up there just to make sure that I could do my therapy session since I did miss group I didn't want to miss therapy to. I am trying to stay in. The Program."
480.0,Provider,yeah.
3675.0,Patient,But I mean oh we're.
480.0,Provider,"So sorry. I know for missing group if that happens again and you don't have the money and happiness group, if you shoot me an email and saying that I can cancel it so it doesn't count as an OSHA. Even though it's group. group it's the same as individual So if you send me an email next time in that situation, then at least it won't count against compliance for you."
3675.0,Patient,So I guess they got more as a no show and that's probably gonna cut my skirt down next week to right.
480.0,Provider,"I mean, she can probably override it because of the situation that's what I love about Dr Marshall and she's very understanding so like if there's only one thing out of compliance. And then typically she can override. That for our script she won't override it if there's like a whole bunch of things like if you don't have your urine you haven't been doing therapy. and humans Group then it's much harder to override but if it's something like one no show for a group when you've been consistent all along that it's probably not going to be a big deal script wise."
3675.0,Patient,"That I hate getting much. Because i've been drawn to get up monthly. yeah so don't don't have this problem, you know it's just hard on everybody. I wished I send another stimulus trip but i'm not sure why."
480.0,Provider,Not right when that be nice.
3675.0,Patient,When.
480.0,Provider,Do you get any money for your kids are they technically you're dependent still or no.
3675.0,Patient,No they're not my opinion.
480.0,Provider,But that's exciting you got your own place.
3675.0,Patient,"yeah I had to get out of where I was living it I just didn't feel comfortable I mean everything was working out but I needed to get my shit together and get mom place, and you know that's what it took for me."
480.0,Provider,"So, are you happy with the place you're at is it like in a decent area. yeah good."
3675.0,Patient,"do some paying $600 rent the light meal, and all this and. it's. All on y'all. bama listen where i'm a little more nice I don't know where city so. yeah I know i'm we making it work."
480.0,Provider,"yeah. Well, just make sure you turn the lights off when you're not using the room, a little. plug all this stuff little tricks to cut bills down that's helpful."
3675.0,Patient,"Believe it or not, i'm plugging cell phone chargers and shit like that another side to do it don't burn that much electricity, but it does."
480.0,Provider,It does it definitely does.
3675.0,Patient,A lot of it depends on how you run your heating and nurses.
480.0,Provider,"As well and it depends on if it's yeah it's electric or gas to like that makes a big difference. You, I have noticed when I am really conscious about going around and turning off lights in the House, as opposed to when I just don't care because my kids will turn on every single light and just. leave the House. So if i'm conscious about going and turning them off it does cut my bill down quite a bit."
3675.0,Patient,yeah.
480.0,Provider,hmm so when did you move into that place.
3675.0,Patient,"um what's today, Wednesday. Monday afternoon."
480.0,Provider,Oh Nice. So you've been a couple nights you didn't get freaked out.
3675.0,Patient,"there's the best in my house, no."
480.0,Provider,I mean you never know.
3675.0,Patient,You never do.
480.0,Provider,never knew no. Job wise things are good like you feel like you can afford that place.
3675.0,Patient,"Honestly, no. yeah and know. If I miss a day of work that's how we're 100 some dollars that i'm losing. i'm is is at least $150 if I miss a day of work. wow as the minimal. So hurt is our to play everything on your own food pay all your living expenses. I mean you're doing it and taking care of kids only 11 years."
480.0,Provider,it's hard it's definitely hard things are expensive very expensive.
3675.0,Patient,And the price just keeps going up.
480.0,Provider,"I know and that's The thing is, like cost of living is so high, and jobs aren't paying that much more than they used to so it's just becoming harder and harder to actually make a decent living, without having to go month to month, you know."
3675.0,Patient,"yeah and i've seen some places word I have grown up. Everywhere, I go around here has arms and that's no. and Then somewhere under me and they're making more to me because, looking pandemic. i'ma quit your job, and then jump back. Just so I can be at what the Fuck no good. This is not there."
480.0,Provider,yeah no I mean it makes sense. hmm.
3675.0,Patient,"You know, because you think about people say it sheets, you know sheets around here store, so it can fit will win a pandemic, here they jumped the 13th. So if you if you were making 1015 all because of the pandemic you got hard and you're making 1350 i'm gonna quit. And then reapply."
480.0,Provider,"So, but when they actually rehire you, though, or would they figure that out."
3675.0,Patient,"If they didn't rehire me honest later so many places around here that I could get another oh. I mean, I think fortune i've worked for myself, I subcontract. You know, depending on what I do, how many hours I work a day or whatever job is on the I charge different prices at some jobs, I do about an hour some some jobs, I do about a job it all depends on what. Would I do where I go."
480.0,Provider,"To interesting okay I didn't so wait, when you say you work for yourself, but then you contract out so."
3675.0,Patient,"I do. I do, maintenance like electrical woman."
480.0,Provider,Oh hey.
3675.0,Patient,"But. i'm in. It says i'm places like know people that have rental properties that hire me to upkeep the maintenance, you know, to go rent like where they call and automatically go."
480.0,Provider,mm hmm.
3675.0,Patient,"You know, because i'm older properties, because I worked there so long."
480.0,Provider,"Nice. Okay, so something that might help you finance wise with bright heart. i'm looking at your chart so the week, I was sick i've been told by everyone in groups that they were charging $6 per group they should have only charged three because there was only one provider there so technically, you do have a $3 credit on your account that you can tell them about. So then, you only owe three instead of six. Because I was just looking back to see what they charge you for that, and they did charge you $6 which was not right, because I wasn't there and there wasn't a therapist filling in for me yeah."
3675.0,Patient,"All right, I didn't even think about that. um I you know I wanted to how they were doing that anyway because start out with. You know you couldn't do a therapy before they started charging six I was only paying 30. yeah even with the other therapist that was there before you only pay $3."
480.0,Provider,Oh weird.
3675.0,Patient,"So. Because I was told remember that they can't double charge. Remember, I can't send a therapy session with you and then do burger, and this was even before they were charging to $6 they were only charging 30 so I don't know if they found a way to get around it is still towards on the same day what."
480.0,Provider,"Well it's not technically two separate appointment. And so that's why so even though there's two providers it's not two separate appointments so medicaid won't cover two separate appointments in the same day um. But I wonder why that changed because that the only thing i've heard is for a while, because of coven they weren't making people pay co pays at all certain insurance companies were like waving co pays and then. That changed, I think, in July that went away, which is why a bunch of people didn't like we had for a while people weren't able to come to group, because nobody knew they had to have money for group because for a while they weren't having to pay a copay."
3675.0,Patient,"Yes, the update all my copay."
480.0,Provider,"So what did you say you said you threaten to leave bright heart, what did you say 10 get them to let you see me."
3675.0,Patient,I told him I was gonna leave because already have a little provider. That I set my brother a weird. yeah hey he's been saying. He only has to pay a $3 copay. And it's not. they're not that they're not will hassle me they're not wrong say hey if you don't have your $3 on that will help you today.
480.0,Provider,"mm hmm. So they just said okay pay it next time, or what."
3675.0,Patient,"No, they won't medical and financial department, because they were like well you can't tell me a CERT because I was like I can I might compare the more, but I definitely know I can pay it been a spring. Right, we need a definite day I said, well, I just told you occupied by new group. yeah I was like look I get paid on Friday for sure I can pay a product. yeah well I won't try to. You know, discuss all my finances with. windows, because it was just the care navigator. yeah relay in the messages back and forth, and I was like look I said I can switch providers, I have my my next script tomorrow, not pei shit and not have to worry about it's not have to worry about doing my therapy not have to worry about doing group. and I don't know they were like we're going with. But this is like the third or fourth time that they've done it."
480.0,Provider,Oh well. Is your brother doing better now that he got in somewhere for suboxone. yeah good that's really good.
3675.0,Patient,You doing real good.
480.0,Provider,Are you guys talking Morgan.
3675.0,Patient,i'm. A little bit not really i'll try to keep my. throat.
480.0,Provider,"yeah that's smart. very smart. So remind me October is triggering because of all the days, you said you lost your mom in October right."
3675.0,Patient,"know I lost my mom in July, but me. me and my wife split up."
480.0,Provider,"The 20th the day before your birthday, I remember that."
3675.0,Patient,And she emailed my brother's girlfriend said that she was filing for divorce on my birthday.
480.0,Provider,She emailed to say. She didn't even like call you.
3675.0,Patient,"See tell me, she she told this to my brother's girlfriend."
480.0,Provider,But she sells them filed for divorce right.
3675.0,Patient,"Now, because the 20% here yet, but she said on my birthday oh."
480.0,Provider,She said she's gonna do it this year.
3675.0,Patient,yeah this year on my birthday.
480.0,Provider,So rude can't she pick any other day.
3675.0,Patient,"And our anniversary with Halloween so I may, I really don't matter it is."
480.0,Provider,wow did she say that recently to your brother's girlfriend.
3675.0,Patient,yeah a couple days ago.
480.0,Provider,"Oh, my gosh. wow."
3675.0,Patient,"She she was remember, I told you, she was strung out on heroin the stuff."
480.0,Provider,yeah.
3675.0,Patient,"She messes my brother's girlfriend proud of it and was trying to tell her that she was 90 days playing when I know for a fact that's a lie, and she was like oh yeah and guess what i'm filing for divorce on the 21st."
480.0,Provider,"She. Which is actually a good thing for you right like we want the divorce, to go through."
3675.0,Patient,yeah but then imma i'm scared i'm gonna lose my health insurance that i've got when our divorce coaster.
480.0,Provider,Why is it through her.
3675.0,Patient,yeah I got medicaid or her because because I probably wouldn't got medicaid without her.
480.0,Provider,huh. Why not you make too much money.
3675.0,Patient,They don't give medicaid to me i'm like that they only give it to women and. alicia family that's normally the only top know like got a child or.
480.0,Provider,"Oh, I didn't. know that I didn't do single men couldn't just get medicaid. that's really unfortunate. um okay so we'll have to figure out a plan, then for you to somehow because you can still apply for medicaid right, but it has to be after the divorce is final, because otherwise so basically nothing will change until the divorce is final word. So we'll just have to make sure we figure out something for health insurance before the divorce is final, because you don't want to be without insurance, because then you'll be paying out of pocket for scripts and stuff."
3675.0,Patient,"will see she don't know where I live in any way, and as long as I can serve the fiber of low me, which is. Like I tell my brother's girlfriend I told her I said, out of fucking contested divorce, just to be is home just because she is picking up on my birthday."
480.0,Provider,yeah.
3675.0,Patient,"You know, do you really want all that, like emotional energy from having to contested divorce. No we're just a book just to put brakes on her plan."
480.0,Provider,mm hmm.
3675.0,Patient,makes me feel better.
480.0,Provider,Okay okay.
3675.0,Patient,i'm not i'm not one of them drama type people but. You know I did tell her last year that that it will make the best mother fucking birthday present if she will packer shit and get the Fuck out but i've told her that a million times i've never told her that on my birthday. And I guess she took it to heart and me to have a good birthday or.
480.0,Provider,"It is possible, it is very possible that she's not doing this to be malicious that she's actually giving you what she thinks you want. yeah."
3675.0,Patient,Because.
480.0,Provider,"The ball, but possible."
3675.0,Patient,I have over a million times that I want a divorce and. I want to be.
480.0,Provider,So if they can't find you to serve you then. What happens.
3675.0,Patient,They can't do nothing.
480.0,Provider,Oh okay well there you go that's how you keep your health insurance just be. A viable.
3675.0,Patient,"way stay married and I can let that happen with the paperwork and field, I served me."
480.0,Provider,Interesting okay. Does she know where you work. No okay so there's literally no way for her.
3675.0,Patient,"To find only yeah only about phone number that's, the only way she knows how to get out ain't nobody going to work."
480.0,Provider,that's good I don't.
3675.0,Patient,have to worry about.
480.0,Provider,Because they can't serve you over the phone like they can't give you notice they actually have to hand you the papers right right okay. wow so aside from being like a little bit angry about her doing it on your birthday what other feelings does this all bring up like thinking about the divorce actually going through.
3675.0,Patient,"Oh man, I wanted to be over with because will not tell women that are married on it. Like they do a complete one it and go back the other way for 60 whatever the foot view."
480.0,Provider,and
3675.0,Patient,Now i'm ready to be done with. Their area we don't we don't want that drama so.
480.0,Provider,So your meal mostly just annoying that she seems to be doing it on your birthday out of spite like it's not that you don't want this it's just the way she's doing it. we're okay that makes sense. It makes a lot of sense. I like your dry erase board on the fridge that's such a good idea.
3675.0,Patient,"Well, above my bed."
480.0,Provider,"Oh, what is it magnetic or did you like tape it or put it up there."
3675.0,Patient,No it's just taped over.
480.0,Provider,"Okay, it looked like a fridge behind you."
3675.0,Patient,know I got a cabinet of Obama bed too so. It does kind of make it a little like a kitchen.
480.0,Provider,Though I guess that's why because you don't typically happen it's about beds yeah. interesting.
3675.0,Patient,"But yeah other this i'm ready to be done without her drama with her. She don't. She don't contact me no more so. i'm happy because, when she does try to stay in touch to me it does bring me down."
480.0,Provider,yeah because.
3675.0,Patient,Part of me still wants to be where even though I know what I will work like i'm I know for sure that I don't want to hit that boat. and run it down the river with her.
480.0,Provider,"But like I think we've talked about before there's a difference between caring about somebody and loving somebody and. Knowing that you can actually be in a relationship with them. So just because you know you can't be in a relationship with her it doesn't have to mean that you don't care about her don't love her or don't want to be with her you just are being realistic, and you know that that would be really unhealthy for you."
3675.0,Patient,It will send me right back down here.
480.0,Provider,"And that's awesome. Some that you can recognize that, because a lot of people in your situation can't even recognize that. So that's big."
3675.0,Patient,"I mean, especially for her doing drove by damn short on more no nowhere around."
480.0,Provider,"So you haven't used recently right, because I think your urine screen was positive for coke because that just from like cleaning everything up."
3675.0,Patient,yeah it had to have what went through my hands or god's order my skin or something that my fault.
480.0,Provider,weird. I figured you would have told me if you relapse because normally you're pretty honest about that stuff.
3675.0,Patient,"yeah that's what i'm saying you know I would have told you, if if I realized, I mean i'm honest about everything I don't have no reason, a lot of men white look as though. yeah no. and Obviously, still need help."
480.0,Provider,"mm hmm. Still that's what I told Dr Marshall I was like there's no part of me. That thinks that he actually used because you're someone that would admit to using if, like, especially if there's a drug test that shows your pot."
3675.0,Patient,yeah.
480.0,Provider,yeah well that's good I didn't use.
3675.0,Patient,yeah I have no problem admitting the truth.
480.0,Provider,"You know that I do, which is why I totally vouch for you, I was like i'm pretty i'm like 99% sure he would totally fess up to it if he actually us."
3675.0,Patient,"yeah Thank you. No and Rebecca her mom she was thinking is he really loved to me why right now. Now we've got this drug test here, showing positive."
480.0,Provider,"mm hmm but also we do understand that those things do happen so she doesn't automatically jump to he's lying, because there are there are a lot of false positives for. Various things. But yeah I don't think I just I hadn't talked to you, since then, and she brought it up to me and I was like oh no that can't be that can't be true."
3675.0,Patient,"I know cuz my gabba pin sometimes. It puts a fire alarm or white amphetamines, or something."
480.0,Provider,I can't remember what.
3675.0,Patient,"It was, but I know we're not taking my Gal pimp more than what else pays to. it'll might get direct his have a fine line on one of the other thing. yeah and that scares me, you know i'm like well hell they're gonna think i'm doing another group. So I try to stay on my limit on what i'm prescribed. But you notice collarbone It gives me a lot of pain, but the more pain pills you take."
480.0,Provider,"More pain, you have."
3675.0,Patient,"More pain, you have in the more you become tolerable on that drug take more and more more like I. wish I could not be profound because you hurt more when you don't have the rv park."
480.0,Provider,hmm.
3675.0,Patient,"I mean it's it's honestly, just like a regular booking street Europe. yeah when a person. And four hours afterwards oh i'm either ready to go home we're taking some more obvious like is that bad."
480.0,Provider,"yeah yeah that's why I like i'm Okay, so I had some stuff sorry that's my dog, not a kid. sounds like a kid but it's a dog um So when I lived in Florida, I went to a pain management doctor for a while, because I have really bad arthritis and fibromyalgia and. They were doing I don't do narcotics because i've been clean for a while, so we were trying a whole bunch of things, and they were giving me. These their anti inflammatories so they're like ibuprofen it's just like prescription strength. And they were saying you want to take four days on and then five days off because of the whole tolerance thing they were like it's really important that if you're taking even something like ibuprofen you can't build a tolerance or that. same things gonna happen you're going to have more pain, but it's not actual pain it's like the pain receptors in your brain are going to trick you into thinking it's more pain."
3675.0,Patient,Right.
480.0,Provider,"So whenever I take anything i'm always like okay i'll take it for like a day, and then I have to give it time and then take it again, which is frustrating, but it seems. To work better that way, have you ever tried naproxen it's like a leaf just stronger. yeah yeah that's a like for like anti inflammatory."
3675.0,Patient,yeah I get those two and I get a prescription oh 800 milligram ibuprofen. But it don't really stay him playing this word of bone has gone under the other bone and pushing up on it and they're they're fucking Roman together.
480.0,Provider,"Oh, my God that sounds so bad I can't even picture that in my mind."
3675.0,Patient,And i'm telling sometimes. Certain wear a robe. Did it hurts like it.
480.0,Provider,sounds so awful.
3675.0,Patient,"lot and i'm right handed I normally drive one hand i'm Dr left hand and now because right after I read my motorcycle week later, I was driving a car. And I lost control of the core I hit some mud and i'm not sure what happened. But I was also in a lot of pain. um when the car started sliding sideways somehow I blacked out. And I don't know. You know, when I went to because i'm a very good drought i've done racing and everything. I don't know if, when I went to turn the wheel, because this is where the bone, this is one of the bones were still like right side by side. And when I would move or move my arm a certain way, they would pop on each other, and it was pitch them on her. So i'm wondering if I like yank the fucking wheel when I blacked out, you know in German and back to. yeah in the pain part and they made me yank it down or my maybe yet Nasir will down harder. And made me flip the core."
480.0,Provider,Totally crap. How long ago did that all happen.

480.0,Provider,So the motorcycle wreck is how you injured your shoulder in the first place.
3675.0,Patient,"yeah I had a speedboat running about 55. Oh was. It third me straight down. On my right shoulder. Like getting a road rash or nothing but it slam me down so hard on on the right side, right here."
