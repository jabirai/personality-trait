I used to have about 20 a day and it came out of nowhere and I couldn't even get out of my house so. that's what i've been afraid to go back to so just pretty bad anxiety, but you know, trying to learn how to deal with it."
498.0,Provider,Of course you're doing a good job at working on it that's all any. um. any difficulty with sleep.
15592.0,Patient,"So i'm a paramedic. And I work 72 hour shifts. So my sleep is all over the place and yeah when I lie down I get that you know the cranking mind i'm kind of thinking about things so. I would say just the the initial falling asleep can be a difficult time and then you know tossing and turning other than that you know, like tonight I didn't get a lot of sleep so because I was up late working other than that is my work schedule that that's bad."
498.0,Provider,Eating okay. Any thoughts about harming yourself. No okay your um how are you handling. How are you handling the short rain with your current position.

15592.0,Patient,"Well, they put a lot of hours on me i've been doing it a lot of long time, so the job and of itself isn't really that difficult it's just it's the hours, but we don't I also too, so I do about 88 hours a week of working. And unfortunately I live in an area where there is absolutely nothing to do so unfair it's kind of a good bad socialization being at work, you know it's a it's a necessary socialization I guess so it's difficult but. You know it's i'm not losing my sanity over for sure."
498.0,Provider,Okay it's still taking care of yourself.
15592.0,Patient,"So that yeah i've talked to my boss about my limitations and everything like that, and where else why yeah."
498.0,Provider,"Okay okay very good. How are you on medication supply are you okay with checking in with me for weeks, just to make sure that we can keep doing what we're doing, and then I can stagger your appointments out there, further."
15592.0,Patient,"yeah I definitely. You see, I think Mike clonazepam. Then I think everything's going to need a refill because the last provider, I had was. yeah so I don't have any refills left and i'm going to be out. Well, it says the it was filled on the. 18th and I probably got you know, a few days left of that. But I think all of my other medication so i'm taking what the wellbutrin vibrated promoter gene. The climate. And what else. it's too much already. Do you have anything else written down there. 40 milligrams of."
498.0,Provider,The wellbutrin. three grams lamotrigine. 201 up in two milligrams.
15592.0,Patient,yeah two milligrams twice a day and then there's folic acid in there.
498.0,Provider,i'm. over the counter or prescription.
15592.0,Patient,yeah my other one prescribed me folic acid.
498.0,Provider,"Okay, that is, one that your primary care provider would have to address."
15592.0,Patient,"Okay, I can get over the counter to. yeah okay yeah I think all of them I don't have the bottles in front of me, but I think all of them are going to need refills because the last person. I breitbart health is that how you say breitbart. bright hard. Right hard break by. The I had a person, and I only saw her once and then they scheduled me with another person that person couldn't meet with me so, then they scheduled me with you, and so they only wrote me a one month, and then I had to call in they wrote another one month, so."
498.0,Provider,I called back.
15592.0,Patient,yeah.
498.0,Provider,"yeah no problem, so let me confirm here on the lamotrigine 200 milligram tablets, not the 100. Are you taking the one who is. twice a day."
15592.0,Patient,it's a I believe it's a 150 tablet with two. To 25 tablets. I believe that's what it is.
498.0,Provider,that's an optional.
15592.0,Patient,Unless they make just 200 milligram tablet.
498.0,Provider,They do take they do make 200.
15592.0,Patient,"Oh, they do."
498.0,Provider,"Are you taking on all of the pills at once. Yes, Okay, so what and that's fine some people take it once a day, some people take it twice a day."
15592.0,Patient,yeah i've had no no problems with it. Is it better to take it twice a day.
498.0,Provider,"It just depends on what you're treating it for and how. How you metabolize and get the most out of it. that's all. and any. Other questions directly for me i'll take care of these for refills for you today, are you currently thing a beer fest outside of right."
15592.0,Patient,"Now I mean I see, I see a psychologists every so often, but they were saying that they did, excuse me a little bit of a cold, they were telling me I had to do some type of group therapy there and i'd never even heard about that. And I asked them I said this and they said that there would be a medication person there there'd be a psychiatrist there and then other people in the room. And I was. not comfortable with that because that's kind of I mean that violates my hipaa rights."
498.0,Provider,"Well, for with with the right heart because you're a mountain valley patient you we can provide you the option to engage in individual therapy. Not group therapy we do provide group therapy as well, and when we're in group your medication and stuff is not disclosed, overall I allow you to contact directly communicate with me regarding in that via the chat otherwise it's a group therapy that's before and out in the open."
15592.0,Patient,"Okay, is it mandatory."
498.0,Provider,"it's typically mandatory with regard to the program mountain valley patients are different, at least according to my understanding. Okay, because you guys, have the opportunity to engage with therapy with mountain valley were able to supplement the individual aspect and again this is at least according to what i'm aware to, and it could be subject to change it may be, or some correction. I believe."
15592.0,Patient,And Belgian.
498.0,Provider,"Know it's recommended patients, when you are attempting to attain a mental health goal overall. psychotherapy is. The work that helps to resolve things, and of course medication helps with the symptom ology. Yes, it's not something that's available to you through mountain Valley, the knockin supplemented here with an individual therapist and individual therapy until mountain Valley, is able to provide that service to you as well. If you and you would be able to engage with a therapist in the same format that you're engaging with me today, one on one and virtually."
15592.0,Patient,"Okay, and how often is that."
498.0,Provider,Twice a month.
15592.0,Patient,"Twice a month. Okay, I do have access to one out here. so that I can do that."
498.0,Provider,"Okay, absolutely it's just that I would I would recommend it and then you can always complete a release of information, just so that I could coordinate with that therapist to let me know how things are going and perspective on progression things of that nature."
15592.0,Patient,"Okay yeah the thing was is I haven't talked to him in a while, because things were going so well I just felt like. You know, because i've been i've done psychotherapy for many, many, many, many years, and because i've been on these medications for God probably since 1996. Which is way too long, but i've done a lot of intensive therapy and the last time I talked to him, I said, things are going so well I don't even know what to say right now, so we haven't met, because things have been going well for me."
498.0,Provider,No good problem to have.
15592.0,Patient,"It for the first time I mean really honestly it's been amazing I can't believe it so that's kind of that's kind of the thing is i'm always working on myself trying to do things in the morning and make myself better and. Trying to decrease, you know that the stuff around me that would make me anxious and what I need to do and. How to I know it sounds cheesy, of course, is how to make myself a better person every day and. I serve my community and stuff like that, and even though i'm not from here so it's it was kind of weird that things are going well and I was talking to him and I said, well, what do we talk about now because usually there's something to work on right so. So if I if if it's a mandatory thing I don't know I don't, I guess, I could do it. No, I did you have a therapy, if you have access to the outside of bright heart that's fine if you have."
498.0,Provider,"Access to therapy, with a mountain valley that's fine. There are just some patients who have not happy, even the access to a therapist."
15592.0,Patient,"Oh, I gotcha."
498.0,Provider,And so we again try to supplement that need. With regard to. Your klonopin therapy it correct me if i'm wrong but you're roughly taking about three milligrams a day is that correct.
15592.0,Patient,"Yes, I will take four or five need to but i'm trying yeah i'm trying to take three. And maybe even start winning down a little from there, but. i'm just. I mean i'm really scared because i've been on it, since 1996 and i'm just really afraid."
498.0,Provider,"I wouldn't recommend too steep of a decline. Because you're doing so well, we can continue with the for now. Because you're you would like to kind of stay on no more than three, but I wouldn't recommend that you just drop down to three, and I think we could continue with for in this encounter and then maybe next month, you could do 3.75 days not. Any in less than that's a test. A trial, we could always go back to four."
15592.0,Patient,"Okay yeah yeah. Okay, I can i'll do that okay."
498.0,Provider,"Very there, I would say very, very, very, very, very slow and like micro taper not not 43 that's that's that's a lot. Okay okay. But look today let's just continue with four and then see how it goes over the next month, and then, if if you feel like you're Okay, with it, you know you're in a good space, you can try out the 3.75 and we'll give that a shot. Let me. If it's okay with you i'd like to see you in four weeks and i'll refill everything we can get you on a continuous cycle. As things progress along we get schedule your appointments at a little with a little less frequency. And then you can check in with me on when you need to want to meet up as needed basis but otherwise you'll continue to see me regularly for both the refills and continuation okay."
15592.0,Patient,Okay sounds good.
498.0,Provider,"Very good, it was nice speaking with you today, let me just verify your. pharmacy that we have on file, I have the you ready for 32 North Main Street."
15592.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
498.0,Provider,"that's perfect okay i'll take care of this for you today should be ready. By the end of the day, because your last prescription was submitted on the 13th should be any issues with its readiness on today no later than tomorrow, depending on the pharmacy okay."
15592.0,Patient,Okay sounds good.
498.0,Provider,"Thank you so much, Mr over for joining me today, I look forward to seeing you again."
15592.0,Patient,"yeah have a great day, thank you."

With continuation of a medication therapy for. bipolar disorder major depressive disorder and. he's me anxiety patients doing well, working and he's in a film that's very stressful right now working at the paramedic indicating that he's working over 80 hours a week, and still managing his mental health of fish efficiently is indicating that this.

Reports of suicide or difficulty with regard to. sleep or appetite that it's not manageable he did report some difficulty with regard to sleep. acquisition in duration or quality but it's work related and he's accustomed to it and it's manageable, but no need to address it at this time.
