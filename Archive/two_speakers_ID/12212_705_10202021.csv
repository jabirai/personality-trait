12212.0,Patient,i'm just taking them. I can yeah.
705.0,Provider,yeah have you been like having to take them more often than not.
12212.0,Patient,"um I think it's been a pretty good, I think I did take them the right way. I was because I took it for that time and then I took I know I shouldn't have but like when I first started, like the week, I was like fixing my schedule. I was taking them to go to sleep, to which I know like i'm not really supposed to do, but like it was. It actually worked out because I helped me reset my schedule and now I don't need to take them anymore, because I get home from work and i'm just tired, so I just go to bed, without it, but I haven't been taken them that much I still got a good amount so."
705.0,Provider,"And that's good and, from what I remember is your your prescription was a prn and as needed."
12212.0,Patient,yeah.
705.0,Provider,"yeah so as needed, then, if you needed it at nighttime then that seems like it's still us with them with the prescription was written for."
12212.0,Patient,"that's true I just I don't know, like everybody they always say like it's like strictly for panic attacks like don't use it, like any other time, you know."
705.0,Provider,"we're you know not being able to sleep, because you were having thoughts and be an anxious."
12212.0,Patient,yeah pretty much.
705.0,Provider,"Okay, and that's where I would say, well, to me, the prescription is for panic attack and to decrease anxiety."
12212.0,Patient,"But yeah it helps like tremendously like if I didn't do that I probably would have been up like all frickin night and then I would have been tired. For. You know, work and, just like trying to fix my schedule in general, oh."
705.0,Provider,"So you're on a normal schedule, whatever that may be."
12212.0,Patient,"yeah uh but I get ready at like get ready for bed at nine and fall asleep at 10 and then I wake up at 530. Okay they're starting at seven and then I get off at four. Okay yeah so it's been it's been Nice because I get off and then I have some time during the evening till you know, like do whatever and. just get ready for tomorrow and it's not a job that's super like. super like. Active like and those, like every job i've had has been like super active and i'm not really an active person so like. it's nice like being able to sit at a desk and just like you know do your thing not really have to worry about anybody else either. You know you clock in you do your work, you clock out you go home there's no really like. Oh, what about this, what about that you know it's just like strict you know, like what it is what it is and, like all my other jobs has been on like shrek time schedules and a lot of moving and. a bunch other stuff like that so it's a lot more calm, not as stressful and it's it's been nice so i'm happy about that."
705.0,Provider,sounds like a better match for you.
12212.0,Patient,yeah for sure.
705.0,Provider,"yeah and the prescriptions to it's Nice that you could take it for that time while you were you know going through the newness of it and it helped you get there, where now i'm hearing even you're using it less and less because you're adjusting."
12212.0,Patient,I haven't even used it since I was since that time that I needed to go to bed and stuff so.
705.0,Provider,that's how that's definitely you know moving in that direction that you're managing.
12212.0,Patient,Okay.
705.0,Provider,dangly.
12212.0,Patient,"yeah I think i'm doing pretty good I just like now I just gotta you know, keep at it keep the habits and not fall into like a. frickin hole."
705.0,Provider,"I would argue that you're doing really well where he said kind oh i'm like no you're doing really well, you have a job you're going to your job you're having to meet new people you're doing this new routine. you're having to have a sleep pattern like you've made all these changes and you initiate it. Making these changes."
12212.0,Patient,"Thank you, I appreciate that it has definitely been pretty drastic and not that much amount of time. yeah it's going good I mean. That whole like thing is good, like everything is like i'm doing good and, like the jobs doing good but still haven't like really felt like you know super like like super happy I haven't really been feeling like super happy, I feel like i'm just kind of go through the motions right now. I mean. I guess isn't a bad thing, but. I guess like I get I keep going back to like thinking, like my mind, is still like kind of thinking about all this stuff and i'm just like trying to like. be mindful and pull myself back into the present but it's just been a hard time, especially because I haven't really been exercising as much because i'm tired when I get off work so that's kind of bad too. yeah there's just been some stuff so you know that just been. racing just like random just random shit nothing even really a particular just I don't know. Maybe it is something in particular, but I just forget about it."
705.0,Provider,Is it occurring. Like a certain time of like right before bedtime during lunchtime.
12212.0,Patient,"yeah i'd say when I go to bed, not so much anymore, because I go I pass out pretty fast, but like just kind of during the day, like around lunchtime and stuff yeah. Just start thinking, but you know I try to do some like breathing techniques and like just put myself back in the present to try to. Stop my mind from wandering you know."
705.0,Provider,yeah Do you remember any of of what keeps replaying.
12212.0,Patient,"um oh something did happen, I tell you crazy. I am a victim of fraud."
705.0,Provider,Oh wow.
12212.0,Patient,"isn't that crazy somebody took $2,000 out of my account. So that sucks."
705.0,Provider,yeah are you getting it taken care of with your bank.
12212.0,Patient,"well. It was through my add was my ID card, so I called Bank of America, and then they transferred me to a fraud department and I had a good talk to the fraud department, and this was probably like two weeks ago, I want to say. They said they were going to do an investigation and stuff, but I still haven't heard anything back from them so it's just been like super annoying, but it was like. it's crazy, though, because the other weird thing was it was in my hometown and it was through an ATM So whoever it was needed to know my pin number. And I don't know who the hell, I think I know who it was, but I don't know for sure and that's just been really bothering me."
705.0,Provider,mm hmm.
12212.0,Patient,yeah. yeah that sucks.
705.0,Provider,While they're investigating did they refund yet to your account.
12212.0,Patient,"So the thing is is they, when I talked to the lady, the first time she was like. i'm going to send you a new card express delivery right away, going to give you a new pin and I got the card, and then I tried to. I tried to use my card, the other day and it's blocked for security reasons, because they're investigating or whatever so i'm like okay I can't even use this shit and then. And then, they said they were going to give me to the $2,000 they said they were going to give me up on a credit. And then, once they do the investigation then they'll decide whether you know I should get it or not, and yeah I can't access my card. I haven't heard anything from them so luckily I still have other money in my other account because that was my add card and sometimes I transfer the money over to my bank card so. But. I don't know that shitty thing is I keep thinking like if it was in my hometown and the person use my pin number. And like say you know they they like they like hit their face from the camera or whatever, and they can determine who was well. How like How are they they don't know me, you know that could like really deter them from you know, like they don't know who it was so I might not even get my money back that's what i'm thinking, but. yeah that's a lot."
705.0,Provider,"yeah. there's that other side too, though Lee is. For a bank and for $2,000 if they're looking at it and you've been banking with them, I mean you know through add and they want to keep that positive for add to bank with Bank of America. That it could be to where they're going to lean more towards the customer and what's going on and doing a proper investigation and it might not be just based on having the picture or not, because most people would hide their face anyway. yeah if they were going to do a scam."
12212.0,Patient,"But the weird thing about it is the person knew my pin so it's like you know that's huge. I feel like, and it was in my town. So I don't know I mean you're right though, like they could and it definitely wasn't me so i'll walk them they i'm going to tell them like if. Once they get like some information they finally hit me back i'm just gonna be like go do a full blown investigation, if you have to because it definitely wasn't me, you know, like I don't care. yeah i'm not gonna i'm not gonna get any repercussions, because I didn't do shit."
705.0,Provider,"Right right. yeah and they probably already walked you through then they they get a. Close that account and then like you said you got a new card, but then you're not able to use your new card because they haven't given you a pen."
12212.0,Patient,whoa they sent it in the mail and I said to go to their website to activate it and I tried to go activated but. It like was saying that I couldn't because the account was like messed up or sumption.
705.0,Provider,"hi. Okay, have you ever received a card and then work within the envelope will give you like a four digit identification, to use the first time until you change your pen."
12212.0,Patient,yeah I think so.
705.0,Provider,me.
12212.0,Patient,"I didn't see it now just safe like go to the website to activate it and I put all the card information and stuff and I guess because. Maybe, because it was my name or something it's just like frozen because they're investigating I just need to call them about it but i've been busy, and I, I have money for right now so it's just like not on my number one. yeah order."
705.0,Provider,And it takes a while you're on hold with add for a long time.
12212.0,Patient,"yeah exactly. Well you've done what you can with it, you got the ball rolling you let them know they're investigating. yeah and it's just kind of freaky. You know, just like it being so close to home, and I haven't I don't know who it is like I think it's my dad's X because she's crazy as Fuck. But I don't know I mean she's probably the only one that would do it that knows my pin you know and her son, because we under somewhere Hello close and he definitely knew my pin and then we stopped talking after they moved out. So I think it's them but I don't know."
705.0,Provider,i'm sorry to hear that happen fraud is just it goes back to that lack of trust and you're like ah.
12212.0,Patient,"yeah because he for sure knew my pen like they lived with us for like five years and we always went to the store together down the street and stuff and like we talked about elisha so i'm pretty sure like they're the only ones that can be. So that sucks i'm just waiting on the footage right now, they said once they look at the footage they're going to send it to my email. I mean you know it might not do any good, but I just gotta wait and see, I guess."
705.0,Provider,"yeah and it's like you were saying Lee assistant guess it's distressful to know that that happened, you know you do have more money in a different account, you can use until they figure it out, and more importantly you're starting a new job adjusting to that."
12212.0,Patient,"yeah I know. Like it's a it's like good, but at the same time it's like man i'm trying to do all this good stuff and then life is just like. Like not today."
705.0,Provider,"it's easy to go there, too, and that's where you know what the trust is like I can't trust anyone, and I say, well, if you look at all your friends, though, and your family and and you know. The majority probably wouldn't but it's unfortunate that someone did choose to take advantage of that."
12212.0,Patient,yeah for sure.
705.0,Provider,So maybe not. Every one is aft up and i'm. unreliable and untrustworthy. But maybe you know one or two the majority you think have your best interest.
12212.0,Patient,"yeah I don't think any of I only have like really like to close friends, so I know they wouldn't do it."
705.0,Provider,mm hmm. Oh yeah.
12212.0,Patient,"I don't know, but I know. I guess like I don't know. i've been like around a lot of bad people and shit like in the past, and I know how I know how people can be like the other is like there is good people, but there are a lot of people that are just messed up. i've had people straight like just take shit from my house, just like kicking it like."
705.0,Provider,"Are you friends still with them, do you invite them in."
12212.0,Patient,"hell, no."
705.0,Provider,yeah and that's where it's like well you don't know what you don't know now that you know that that type of person you're like oh no i'm not gonna invite them in.
12212.0,Patient,"I mean it's kind of messed up, but like. If I feel like i'm being done wrong like I can cut people off like really quick."
705.0,Provider,mm hmm.
12212.0,Patient,"Like if somebody like does something. yeah i'll cut him off. that's happened a lot i've cut a lot of people off like a lot like that's why I only have two friends, though."
705.0,Provider,"Do you give them, though, would you say the benefit of the doubt, but if something happens in your alarm goes off and you're you're like Okay, I need to proceed with caution and then you just make the judgment call that hey this isn't worth it."
12212.0,Patient,"yeah like it's like. it's like multiple things you know, like I don't just cut them up like that, but like over like a series of years, like i've cut multiple people off for like continuous stuff that they've done. it's just it is what it is, I guess you know i'm 27 now, so you kind of grow up and you I guess your friends circle just gets smaller because you know, some people. Do bad thing if."
705.0,Provider,you've had the experience to now where through the experience you've become wiser and more selective of who you allow into your circle.
12212.0,Patient,"For sure. For sure. I was like really naive about that stuff like when I was younger. Like I just kick it I just kick it with anybody and i'd like I have i've have a lot of trust in people like I used to think that, like people do no wrong, you know what I mean but that's just not the case that's not the case."
705.0,Provider,"To balance it, though it's like you know I especially after a situation like what you went through Lee. As it's easy to tip the scale where it's like all people are bad or all people don't deserve trust where can you balance it a bit will some like your your two friends that you're talking about sounds like quality friendships."
12212.0,Patient,yeah.
705.0,Provider,You trust.
12212.0,Patient,"yeah I trust them 100%. But it is, I will, I will say, though, like, I guess, it is really hard for me to trust. Like that's like an awesome. that's also another reason why I only have two friends, because. Well, maybe trust has something to do with it, but it is hard for me to make friends and I feel like I don't trust, a lot of people. So I couldn't be a thing that I didn't even know."
705.0,Provider,It can't be true because of your experience and like you were saying you've had people over and they've done some things that were questionable and you've learned to protect a little bit more and you're not you're more selective of who you invite in.
12212.0,Patient,yeah for sure for sure.
705.0,Provider,And sometimes that's a healthier than than just allowing everybody to come in and do what they need to do and don't fall over yeah.
12212.0,Patient,that's what I used to do pretty much.
705.0,Provider,"So now, this is a healthier series for you or you're like okay here's here's what you know what I value, I value to be able to trust those that i'm going to invite into my home and into my life."
12212.0,Patient,"yeah for sure, trust is like. Trust is like my number one thing and somebody like that's like my number one thing like trust over love like trust is like number one. Like I value that shift so much, and if you break a trust they're really just like pisses me off."
705.0,Provider,"wow. wow for you, then, we were having this event happen i'm sure, then it works off of that then feeds into already I don't like about the trust now, I think that maybe it's somebody I know."
12212.0,Patient,yeah.
705.0,Provider,"And if it is you know, like you were saying your dad's eggs and possibly the sun is just it's it's unfortunate."
12212.0,Patient,yeah. yeah but.
705.0,Provider,they're definitely not in a healthy space.
12212.0,Patient,"I mean. yeah they're not why we she isn't for sure she'd be like doing drugs and drinking and she. She crazy. I despise that a woman, I hate her like i've never hated anybody in my life more than I hate that woman and she if it is her, she still continues to just fucking. Try to ruin my life I hater. she's crazy man she says just fucking. blackout and start throwing shit and yeah like Hello fucked up shit just like talking to hell, a smack just like saying those things that like just like dig really deep you know, like she just like says these nasty things. hey dude I hate her. Even thinking about it pisses me off."
705.0,Provider,"Well, I am glad that she's no longer in your life and that you don't have to worry about that."
12212.0,Patient,yeah me too.
705.0,Provider,mm hmm.
12212.0,Patient,"But. I guess I just got to keep going. And just wait, I guess, see what they can do."
705.0,Provider,"Right and you've done, you know hearing you leave done everything that's in your power to. To put it out there it's their job to investigate and to let you know. yep yeah."
12212.0,Patient,I guess that's like one thing. coast stressful. yeah that.
705.0,Provider,yeah that created a lot of extra work for you and starting a new job in itself is stressful and then you had this. Surprise here's this other thing that you're going to have to deal with that you did it.
12212.0,Patient,"yeah like that was that, like that money was, for that was like the money, I was going to use, so I get my place. Like I wanted to use that money to get a new place which puts me back online services me off, but I get paid on Friday, so I get to see what my checks look like. That or like kind of tell me where i'm at like what I gotta do, but I definitely got to be like more definitely gotta be careful, a lot more without I spend. Your hair. So this sucks but I mean what are you going to do."
705.0,Provider,But it's also. Had you take a look at finances and your goal is to move out and you're like okay so maybe i'm gonna have to reevaluate how I choose to spend money on to.
12212.0,Patient,Oh yeah that is right that is right i've already been thinking about it like a new stop buying food every day I need to make my lunches. And that's all I really been thinking. About i've been thinking about that.
705.0,Provider,"And that's a money saver so you're already on that path it's also to like give yourself permission that. Just make it through the next couple weeks with a new job like you were talking about exercising you know how to exercise, and when you get the time and you've adjusted okay."
12212.0,Patient,"As well that's what I was saying to myself last week, I was like it's my first week i'll do it on Monday, which was yesterday I was like i'm going to start working out and then I didn't do it. And now i'm saying i'm going to do it after. After this time I do it because I like it's like one of those things where like I was telling myself last week and I don't. I don't like to tell myself and not do it because that's like one of those things right, like you need to be able to trust yourself to love yourself like if you tell yourself you're going to do something, you should do it. You know I mean I feel like it's bad if you tell yourself to do something and then you don't do it it's just like a it's not a good thing for your mind. You know."
705.0,Provider,"So you want to follow through. Is there ever room for though making a last minute judgment call. Like was work if you started a new job and you said you were going to work out, but you didn't. Is can you give yourself an adjustment time."
12212.0,Patient,"yeah. Well that's what i'm trying to do, I guess, but I think like honestly like. i've just been gaining even more way and, like, I feel like gain this much weight is making me like not as confident and then i'm thinking about like. I want it like i've been thinking about like a girlfriend but like it's always been really hard for me to get a girlfriend because, like i'm Hello we're both girls and. Now that like i'm getting even better i'm just like it's just like that's really been bothering me a lot too so that's probably why i'm thinking about it so much."
705.0,Provider,And why it's important to you. What that.
12212.0,Patient,dude I was lonely man.
705.0,Provider,"Oh, I think Lee you're gonna find that there's a person that matches you and, just like you said you know we're all unique and you're going to find someone that's unique also and that might be the best match that you didn't even know and you're like, here it is. starting off small to with your exercise like could you even if tonight, if you did stretches or something would that meet the least standard."
12212.0,Patient,I need to do my 30 minute Cardio. Yes.
705.0,Provider,And where do you do the 30 minute Cardio.
12212.0,Patient,"We have a little gym in the apartment complex, so I go there and I run on the treadmill. Okay it's not too bad you know it makes it a lot easier, so I don't have to like run all around. yeah sure so."
705.0,Provider,And it comes with the payment of rent you don't have to pay extra.
12212.0,Patient,It comes with it. But the red here is a really frickin expensive so. Like frickin over 2500 a month. Which is pretty friggin wild.
705.0,Provider,yeah rent and California steep.
12212.0,Patient,"that's like that's that's another thing, and I was just talking to my friends about this, the other day, like when you grow up in California. And like it's all you know and everything and, like you, grow up and everything so damn expensive it's like people are just like oh move move out somewhere cheaper it's like. Oh, this is all I know, like it's not that easy to just get up and like go somewhere like completely new and just like oh."
705.0,Provider,yeah like go to the desert it's like yes it's cheaper there because there's not a lot of opportunities are not as much as what you get by where you live.
12212.0,Patient,"So, but i've been looking and there's been some pretty affordable places like around 1500 a month, so yeah was a two bedroom with my friend. Each."
705.0,Provider,"Okay, I was gonna say 1500 that's so that's still."
12212.0,Patient,Oh yeah yeah I wish.
705.0,Provider,yeah.
12212.0,Patient,"But no, because, like if you all, like the single apartments I look at everything like they're even more expensive it'd be like a team to to. yeah so."
705.0,Provider,Here right to be able to split it with something someone 1500 is is doable.
12212.0,Patient,"For sure and it's one of my to close friends so i'm not even i'm not even really trippin about it, I don't mind it yeah, but it is expensive really expensive I can never afford to be here that's for sure."
705.0,Provider,"Well you're making it happen by getting the job, which is one of the action steps that was needed to get you out of the House and in your your own environment that you choose."
12212.0,Patient,"Yes, it's been nice, you know getting out and being in own environment just do my own thing so. yeah it's been good it's been I just want to learn everything you know learning everything has been. Also kind of stressful, of course, because you're learning it but and there's a lot to learn there's just so many things to input."
705.0,Provider,mm hmm.
12212.0,Patient,But. yeah I mean it's it's still been alright it's not that bad.
705.0,Provider,yeah i'm glad you you're like I hear to where you're giving yourself some grace it's like okay i'm new at this i'm going to learn it but yes there's a lot to learn.
12212.0,Patient,yeah I mean like in terms of like. stress and difficulty like it's my easiest job i've had so. that's definitely a plus I feel like all the other jobs i've had have been like super stressful. So. So.
705.0,Provider,And you get your paycheck is coming this week.
12212.0,Patient,yeah Friday okay.
705.0,Provider,it's always nice to get the paycheck that hits the motivation button.
12212.0,Patient,"that's what i'm thinking i'm like I just need to see this, and which is another thing that's cool is this is the most i've made from a job and it's the easiest. So I mean like that's Another thing I can't complain about so that's why i'm waiting to see what it looks like to be better than i'm used to."

Fast that's why I was, I think the most disturbing thing about that whole thing thing was the fact that I lost money because I feel like it's going to slow the process. Probably. A good amount, but we'll see like I said, I have to see what the check is."
705.0,Provider,And if you do get a chance to call and follow up that's always an option to for you just to kind of fight fire under okay didn't be evey let's see what you got.
12212.0,Patient,yeah cuz it's taken them a cool minute that bad said damn word.
705.0,Provider,mm hmm.
12212.0,Patient,But I don't know it probably happens all of a sudden there's probably a lot of cases. But yeah I still need call them under Nicola.
705.0,Provider,"You have a lot of empathy and and you're right, you probably do have a lot of cases but yours matters, just as much as anyone elses."

705.0,Provider,yeah you are making it happen.
12212.0,Patient,try my best. try my best. We can do.
705.0,Provider,"yeah we were talking it wasn't even a little over a month ago, where you were like yes i'm going to get a job that's going to be hard to do, because sometimes with society and you would go there. you're came all that you got the job. you're already working the job you're about to get paid from the job you're making stuff happen."
12212.0,Patient,yeah that definitely makes me happy. happy.
705.0,Provider,And those other things too will start to fall into place like with you working out and getting your routine down you switched your sleeping routine to something that was healthier.
12212.0,Patient,yeah.
705.0,Provider,So celebrate the wind check at the sleep pattern back.
12212.0,Patient,"yeah. Now I feel like it's like I feel like it's kind of like a there's a lot of uncertainty, too, because I feel like i'm going into I feel like i've kinda like restarted in a sense, because, like before this year, like i've always been. Just smoking drinking. Having horrible sleep schedules and just like doing a whole bunch of like bad shit that I never really thought about I just did it. But like this year, like, I feel like i've changed a lot and i'm being a lot more responsible so i'm just hoping that it's just uncertain and I just hope that I can say this way and keep doing what i'm doing without any downfalls it all feels so new though so."
705.0,Provider,"And it is and leave the thing that you have that maybe you didn't have before is you have experience you have coping strategies now like, before drinking and that kind of thing is a coping strategy may not be the healthiest one. But you survived and you like used it as a coping skill now you have these other things you can use. Your exercise, you know we were talking about to the deep breathing and doing any of that when you need to."
12212.0,Patient,yeah sometimes sometimes I think about it i'm like. Like I didn't I never like never realize like how much that helps like I just I didn't think it was I guess just being young or something I don't know I just didn't I didn't realize it I just thought getting messed up was like my only option at that time.
705.0,Provider,"That was what your role model your father he's your caretaker you know that's what you've been seeing, so I could see where that would be an easy behavior to follow."
12212.0,Patient,yeah I never. I just never realized it backbone. And now I do so. that's why i'm hoping it's you know it's going to be scary better this time around.
705.0,Provider,Is that I think the last time we talked you were saying that only on the weekends is is pretty much when you tend to drink is that still the same.
12212.0,Patient,"pattern okay yeah Friday and Saturday. Yes, all right."
705.0,Provider,"hey just eliminating all those other days right there if you're you know talking about calories and especially empty calories. any type of alcohol converts into sugar, which is usually not good for the body and puts on some extra pounds and so you're eliminating you know down to to two days a week."
12212.0,Patient,yeah. But I was never I was never big when I was younger i've always been small like even when I used to heavily heavily during click. I was at like frickin 150.
705.0,Provider,"yeah how old, are you though."
12212.0,Patient,dude what's 25 hit. My metallic my I don't know what happened. yeah my metabolism just went out the window I swear 25 I like it just started.
705.0,Provider,yeah.
12212.0,Patient,"In bigger and then cove it hit. Yes, and I was just it was done up."
705.0,Provider,"In your so right. And that certain 20 and you know those 25 shares it starts to you really notice that exercising is key, trying to be healthier and what you eat were before you could eat whatever you need it like I lived off a cheeseburger some price for many years."
12212.0,Patient,Oh yeah same here this.
705.0,Provider,Week yeah.
12212.0,Patient,It really does.
705.0,Provider,"yeah it doesn't mean that you can't sometimes treat yourself, you just can't eat the food and drink like you did when you were in your 20s."
12212.0,Patient,"I know that's another thing that i've been i've been messing up on that, and on top of not working out i've been eating a lot of fast food and sugar, which I just know isn't good. So i'm going to try to i'm going to try to set like a reset on that and try to start buying stuff from lucky's and like do what I was doing before because I completely fell off of it game and yeah i've started gaining again."
705.0,Provider,what's your go to to take when you're working.
12212.0,Patient,When i'm working like my food.
705.0,Provider,"yeah, what do you take for lunch."
12212.0,Patient,"I usually go to togo's. This isn't that bad, but I mean it is so kind of high in calories it's like 1000 calories for good sandwich but. Then Sometimes I get off of work and I don't feel like going to like lucky's or like whatever the grocery store and then I just go get some like frickin mcdonald's or like whatever."
705.0,Provider,"it's. About you at because, at first, you know you're just looking to feed yourself you're at work it's all new it's like okay you got back you know you got through the first couple of weeks."
12212.0,Patient,And it's just so good. Like fast food is just so good for like that's like another addiction I swear. That should have good like I think about like i'm like I know i'm like you know I should go to the grocery store and get something good to eat and i'm just like. But that burger and those those chicken nuggets out real good right now.
705.0,Provider,"Especially when your office mates are having like a Turkey on rye, and it looks you know you're like. yeah Okay, you know here you are with your burn like Maybe I should change up to the Turkey arrived, but your burgers tasting better."
12212.0,Patient,So much better.
705.0,Provider,yeah Could it be that you could do the same thing in and monitor it to a couple of days a week. yeah. It is and that's why I was asking with the go to because sometimes if you have like something that you actually look forward to that you can pack yourself.
12212.0,Patient,yeah that's what I was thinking like maybe some like sandwiches or something. Just like do it the night before. yeah put in the fridge or something. yeah I think this weekend. i'll try to fix some stuff around with my eating habits and stuff. shopping.
705.0,Provider,yeah get paid you're getting get paid and then also looking at. How much can you potentially save by not eating out every day of the week.
12212.0,Patient,"that's see that's true that's so true you can save a lot of money. I always go like. Every time I go there, when I was getting them before like I would just get like the ones that are on sale and like you get like 15 of like the dinners for like working like 20. Like 2025 bucks or something it's like 15 those frickin things you know. So it's a lot cheaper than spending like frickin $10 for one frickin meal dollars, plus."
705.0,Provider,"And it's gone up the pricing, it seems like everywhere that the prices, especially with takeout it's like. And why yeah."
12212.0,Patient,"I have a I had a not so much lately, but I have a bad habit of getting doordash. I would spend so much money on door dash it's crazy. I got a dash pass. spreadsheet so it's funny I was like well since i'm using it so much this will save you a little bit."
705.0,Provider,"yeah and I hope leave it why you're trying to make these changes is that. Instead of beating yourself up about it and be like Okay, I need to do this, and this, and this is to be able to make. realistic goals for yourself and to just see why why you're creating something into more of a healthy routine if you say you're going to eat, you know pack a lunch. twice a week and you do one time that week is being like okay i'd like to do better, but not to where it's such a high standard where you're like oh I mess this up, you know and going inward."
12212.0,Patient,yeah no definitely because I yeah I definitely tend to do that to myself i'll be it's like yeah it's like that high standard thing like I keep like my standards are way too high for like everything I feel like I just need to like tell them that down like a lot. that's a that's a good way of explaining it this high standards thing.
705.0,Provider,"it's the high standards that keeps you trying to strive for that professional as part you know, and you can't be a perfectionist because you're human we're human."
12212.0,Patient,"I know well, apparently, I don't know but. yeah. I just need to try to fix that I guess."
705.0,Provider,"it's all new things for you leave that you've really taken a hold of and you're like okay well, let me take a look at that and that's healthy to explore and to have you know motivation to do these things, and make healthy changes. That can be. Its back on the balance, though we don't want to go too far, where we're like so rigid and stringent and. That standard we can never meet."
12212.0,Patient,"yeah thinking about it that i've spent a lot of my time when my mind wanders off I spent a lot of time like. Thinking about how to fix myself because there's just like so many things that I want to change, but like I haven't changed. Like being by having high standards being too serious like I told you before like I want to be like really just like carefree and let loose. Like all this stuff but, like, I always come off as like. You know super serious like high standards and all that shit that's like other stuff that like I think about and i'm thinking about all these things, and I want to try and change them but i'm not so I feel like maybe that's probably kind of putting my mood down to. yeah it's hard to like not put my mood down because I have like those frickin high standards, you know."
705.0,Provider,"How old, are you right now Lee. Point 727 27 years and you've been doing things a certain way and it took time to get to the unhealthy eating the other things of doing you know, being more serious than you. You had earlier, you know and your young life, you had a death of a parent, which also plays a part of people being more serious and feeling like that carefree. Left where the inner child you didn't get to be anymore. it's understanding that piece and going Okay, I can see where, as a child, this is what I had to do and. That was for a reason that was a Defense mechanism to get serious and just be like okay. Now it's going to take time for these new things to like take hold and for you to figure out what feels better for you and what feels right. Because I don't think Lee Lee would you always want to be humorous and just you know nothing in the world, even dense you you don't even think about it. So it's back to that balancing it's just like Okay, maybe sometimes you can be serious, but sometimes too, you can have more of a carefree spirit."
12212.0,Patient,yeah. I just say to try to figure out.
705.0,Provider,"And it can come to you, at times, where it's just like yeah and some of these things it's more cut and dry. Like what the trim if it's like you're like okay I figure this out, I work out my Cardio this many minutes and it's like check something like being carefree that takes a little bit more creativity, to see how is that going to how do I get there."
12212.0,Patient,"yeah. yeah for sure. Just. I know it's getting late but. I have another thing too, but I didn't say. I don't know if, like this probably like affected me to something that I thought about for a long time. But. The same time my mom passed away I also had a girlfriend that was like the love of my life for life by longest relationship and she was there for me like throughout the whole thing and then. After all of that we have like she was like gonna go off to college and stuff and we had like this whole plan like I was gonna like go to and will and then like she ended up going and then pretty much just like. drop me like completely and that was all in like the same time span. So, like all of that, on top of everything was like super hard yeah. I don't know if that like. Did anything, because I feel like it's Hella hard to like have relationships sentra."
705.0,Provider,"yeah and and to have that as an experience, especially so young, and if this was your first love, I can hear you know Lee that she was supportive through that time it's unfortunate how it turned out, and that was probably the first time that you had your heart broken."
12212.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
705.0,Provider,and
12212.0,Patient,That was like I was 1919 at the time. yeah. I don't know if that's like i'm sure like thinking about it now that was probably some sort of like trauma shit.
705.0,Provider,mm hmm. Absolutely and compound it with losing your mother and then losing someone else that was significant in your life.
12212.0,Patient,"yeah I feel like I won like i'm trying to figure out if there's like something like that that will affect me like against like females somehow because I feel like it's like so hard to like get in a relationship or like even like talk to a girl. I got no. it's a little weird I don't know if there's like a you know, like some connection between that or something yeah."
705.0,Provider,"I think what it really is is how you said it, and I think just the fact that you lost two significant people pretty close you know, in time, and you were so early into developing what it's like to be in a relationship and the trust that definitely maybe that has some influence on how. You respond to even thinking about being in a relationship and how you trust, maybe females. you're talking about it, though, which is healthy, if it was off your radar and you weren't willing to even acknowledge like hey this is this is this is part of what I went through. I know that it probably is connection of why i've been more distant and starting a relationship, you have that experience of what happened."
12212.0,Patient,yeah.
705.0,Provider,"Being healthier with yourself and starting to get even more self confident and knowing that. Not all relationships, will, in that way, not all circumstances, you know you're 27 now when when this happened, how old were you."
12212.0,Patient,know it was like 1920.
705.0,Provider,yeah for 19 or 20 year old to go through all that Lee is really challenging and it can feel like you're lost and alone. Now you're. 27 yeah. Would you say today that you belong. To the same degree.
12212.0,Patient,Definitely not to the same degree that was like a whole nother degree. But I do still feel. Pretty lonely sometimes.
705.0,Provider,And longing to be in a relationship and share your life with someone.
12212.0,Patient,"yeah yeah. So, like there was like a whole like. Throughout my 20s after that happened and I started like doing a hell of bad stuff I would just like. Do the whole like you know hit it and quit it kind of stuff and just like. Be Hella like messed up, though, you know and it's just like I was just doing all these stupid things and I like now I can't even like really connect. Like you were."
705.0,Provider,"You were hurt Lee and through that. working through the hurt and working through the pain of loss, it takes time and. i'm not surprised substances was something that you turn to because, especially at that age it's very common that the substances people go wild. And it's just like I I can't make the pain go away, but i'm an intimate and i'm going to drink until we're used other things until I don't think about it."
12212.0,Patient,yeah yeah I was like. Like I said when I used to do hell is bands like and drink with it like that she took it away. I was just like on I was on my bucket mode. There dude.
705.0,Provider,"i'm glad that you you're here today and that you care today, and I think with it leaves in time. I believe that, yes, of course, you can have healthy relationships, you have experiences from when you're really young, then you went into substances and then this is a whole new. You know, some people call it more adult thing like in your 20s late 20s it's more on the adult side, where when you're still 22 you're still get to say oh i'm still you know my early 20s. yeah to me that new chapter that's there and that I think that's healthy too long to want to be in a relationship. When you feel more secure to with. where you are, you know how you feel about yourself with the job, a different, maybe even home environment. You may start branching out and to start to see you know get yourself back out there in the dating world."
12212.0,Patient,"that's what that's, that is what i'm hoping because i'm not. I guess, like, I guess, I just have to wait for that I feel like i'm somebody that has to you know I have those high standards so like. I feel like I can't be at this age and like so living with my dad and like not even like supporting myself and like trying to like you know, have a relationship on top of that, but at the same time, I do so it's just like really. aggravating."
705.0,Provider,"or you're human and to have two things happened to you in your early 20s or you were 19 right. yeah 19. And that you manage the best that you could. And now you know that there's another way you didn't know, then."
12212.0,Patient,you're.
705.0,Provider,Releasing and forgiving yourself of what you've been through.
12212.0,Patient,yeah I need to do that.
705.0,Provider,And it can't be easy lead to also have what you're dealing with with your father and how that affects you.
12212.0,Patient,"Just a lot it's really annoying. I just think that that's why I think that's why I just need to like I need to get this shit rollin I just need to do this. Oh, we need to get."
705.0,Provider,Your getting as you put it you're getting this shit rolling. You are.
12212.0,Patient,Trying and I just wanted to go faster.
705.0,Provider,"yeah and that's you know I think that's understandable, we all want things to like come on now, and especially when you've had so many years of this and you're like Okay, I am ready now I am healthier today. And here's what I want I want it now and then to life is like wait for it wait for it."
12212.0,Patient,Like no.
705.0,Provider,"forgiving yourself for where you are in life. that's all that you know, and so you did your best."
12212.0,Patient,yeah. Definitely a few instances that were definitely lucky to be here that's for sure.
705.0,Provider,mm hmm. And one day you're going to find that may that. you're to see that they match up really nice and it's just like this is what i've been waiting for.
12212.0,Patient,That would be nice oh definitely be nice.
705.0,Provider,"You have tons of potentially I you know I know I don't have my crystal ball anymore, because a broke a long time ago. I would have to say. The way that you're able to express yourself and the empathy have for others, all of that you're smart guy like you have all these things that someone is going to be lucky to have you and be like oh. here's what i've been waiting for."
12212.0,Patient,"Oh, thank you, I appreciate that."
705.0,Provider,will come out of nowhere and then you're going to be like what is this.
12212.0,Patient,Like finally.
705.0,Provider,"Yes, and then I might be talking to you and you and I got back in the dating world and now it's really trying to see Am I only going to date one and that's how it's gonna be or is it there's this whole other options."
12212.0,Patient,"hello, I definitely don't feel like that, right now, but hopefully."
705.0,Provider,It is more getting comfortable with yourself getting things for you feel like even more confident and that's going to people can can read that.
12212.0,Patient,"yeah I just felt I I think I just burned, a lot of bridges with girls like doing. doing what I did. Like yeah."
705.0,Provider,Do you think Lee girls are innocent.
12212.0,Patient,No.
705.0,Provider,"No, you think that they burned some bridges to."
12212.0,Patient,yeah for sure.
705.0,Provider,"Oh yeah. For sure yeah and when we're that young and we don't know as much about love we do some things that we wouldn't do maybe today but back then, and especially if it's substance induced. i'm never surprised, because if you're if you're already with your your mind your decision makers, under the influence you're not gonna make a good decision."
12212.0,Patient,Yes.
705.0,Provider,"And that's where the forgiveness, that the things that you can forgive yourself about just be like like Okay, I know that that was part of me dealing with life at that time and yeah I didn't make the best decision, but that doesn't define me. I am looking at to because I know for November I didn't see I don't think we said any of the individual sessions right because we were waiting on your job and seeing what your schedule is like."
12212.0,Patient,We did not set any individual. I got my group set up for. Thursdays at six.
705.0,Provider,"Oh, you did okay."
12212.0,Patient,But I still have to go into the Center is something they keep bothering me they want to talk to me about something. I don't know what it is.
705.0,Provider,"i'm looking to because the last time we had talked unlike your care intensity of how much you have groups and stuff is. We changed everything to twice a month, so groups or twice a month, you and I meet twice a month, you can go to more appointments the group, you know, like, if you want to attend more. that's that's fine, but I went ahead and put it at twice a month, where with your work schedule it that gets in the way."
12212.0,Patient,"Okay, I didn't even know that."
705.0,Provider,"yeah the last time we talked I think we talked about the care intensity and when you were getting your job to reduce it some reading on here. See. yeah so twice twice a month would be for the individual and twice a month for the Group then Lee if that you know, again, you can go to more groups. But at least with you know how the care intensity like if let's say you had to cancel and you only want to say three, then it would look like that you're out of that care intensity because you're really going to say weekly. Whereas this way, if you want to come into group and you feel like you need some support that week, then you can."
12212.0,Patient,Okay.
705.0,Provider,"and yeah and if you know this way again if you have meetings or something like that. Every now and then I always tell people every now and then, though the care intensity might go back to what it was before, if that happens, and they call you to the virtual clinic you can let them know that your care intensity is. Twice a month for everything twice a month for groups twice a month for individual sessions, and you can go more if they need to reach out to confirm, they can do it because, for some reason the care of the intensity i'll change it, and sometimes it goes back. it's like a computer glitch."
12212.0,Patient,So am I going to know which weeks it is if it's twice a month.
705.0,Provider,Is long as what the grip.
12212.0,Patient,"Actually, I know I know I have one next week I think so. i'll just go off of that."
705.0,Provider,"Okay, I see that. let's see it looks like yeah I see on the 21st there's a six o'clock."
12212.0,Patient,or not next week yeah I mean this week yeah the 21st.
705.0,Provider,"yeah because this week, would, which would be. yeah i'm like looking at the gallery, yes, the 21st would be this week, so instead of you coming to Friday you're scheduled for the Thursday at 6pm. yeah okay and. When i'm looking at that, because you already did you already do two groups in October."
12212.0,Patient,No.
705.0,Provider,that's where it would need to be.
12212.0,Patient,I don't think.
705.0,Provider,"yeah i'm looking at it and I don't see. It looks like on 10 one at 12 o'clock that you did go to that group. That says check in but i'm not seeing beside it patient attended, do you know if you went on the first of October."
12212.0,Patient,"So much going on, I think there might have been one there might have been a week where I called in, and I told them that I couldn't make it, I think that was this month."
705.0,Provider,"i'll see if I can find it on the other side in your notes, which one So if you have a calendar, or you use something on your phone to. circle or highlight or keep track, you would need to keep track of which two you're going to go to so if the cat care navigators they're going to see that you're required to go to two So if you. You know if you're not going to go to let's say one you wouldn't need to cancel because you're only required to go to two, so the care navigators like when I look in and you didn't go. On the 15th you canceled right and it says cancel treatment plan follow up to look at it and that's the new care intensity does that make sense, sir."
12212.0,Patient,yeah so just keep track of the two that I have to go to.
705.0,Provider,"Right, I had someone that didn't pay attention to the dates and so like let's say. If you were going on Fridays again and and you. Well, that would be a good example, but sometimes what happens is if it doesn't fall within the same month then if you're only doing one then you're still not satisfying because it's supposed to be twice a month at least. Okay, and you do not have to choose which two you're going to but make sure that you're going to to during that month time."
12212.0,Patient,Okay.
705.0,Provider,"And then the same thing with you and I, as long as you and I are meeting twice, which I can see, on here on the Fifth, we met and then today, so that would satisfy this month. And then we'll schedule to in November, if you like."
12212.0,Patient,yeah.
705.0,Provider,"And then we were going to see to with your groups, let me just pull up the see if I can tell, on your note which one."
12212.0,Patient,"yeah changed i'm pretty sure I changed it on the 15th like you said I call them and then. A switch to switch so Thursday. Okay that's six. wanted to do Wednesday or Thursday, because I was kind of later on, and I wanted to be like a. Week kind of thing."
705.0,Provider,mm hmm.
