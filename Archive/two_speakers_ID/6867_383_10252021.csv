6867.0,Patient,How are you.
383.0,Provider,Good morning pretty well how are you doing this Monday morning.
6867.0,Patient,Not so good grandma passed away on Saturday night.
383.0,Provider,Oh. well.
6867.0,Patient,"I was up at three o'clock in the morning on Saturday, because I heard her moaning and everything, so I went in there and took care of her from like three o'clock on. And I went back to sleep, I went to sleep at about eight o'clock that night because well i've been up since three so I was just absolutely tired, so my wife told me lay down i'll wake you up if there's anything going on i'm like okay. And 10 o'clock she comes and taps me and says, I don't think grandma's breathing can you go check."
383.0,Provider,uh huh.
6867.0,Patient,So I get up and I go in there and. yeah I felt.
383.0,Provider,i'm sorry you just do just disconnected I can't hear you.
6867.0,Patient,Can you hear me now.
383.0,Provider,I can hear you now.
6867.0,Patient,"yeah somebody was trying to call me whenever that happens, a blocks up everything."
383.0,Provider,Right right.
6867.0,Patient,"So I went in there and I kept her pulse. And everything like that, and she was already called it a touch so. She was already gone. And we didn't go to bed till about one o'clock the next day because it took the corner about an hour and a half to get here so."
383.0,Provider,that's. How you feeling I mean you've. done something to keep her take care of her.
6867.0,Patient,"me and Sarah me and my wife both have a touch of I guess you could call it a caregivers guilt. Where it's like you know, even though you know you couldn't do any more than you could then you did with her and everything is all you still feel like there might have been something more, you could have done or whatever like that, but. It was just it just she just went quick."
383.0,Provider,"Well that's such a blessing really I mean she was not disturbed in terms of having to go into a hospital. or to a. Like nursing home, I mean the fact that she got to stay in in with you guys."
6867.0,Patient,"She wanted to die at home, she wanted to be die at home and be surrounded by family so and, even though it was just me and my wife here, but she knew we were both here."
383.0,Provider,yeah and you guys have been taking care of her for some time. Hello six years.
6867.0,Patient,Almost six years. i've been living here we've been living here since 2015.
383.0,Provider,"That is a significant amount of time. And the fact that she was you know passed at home, I mean, I think that you guys did everything that you could give her what she wanted."
6867.0,Patient,"And the weirdest thing happened after she after the corner kercher body. My wife and I were in the back room, you know, having a cigarette and just trying to calm down from everything. And then, all of a sudden, the porch they are the light in the back, started to flicker. And it was the only light my house, I was flickering it was raining here, so we thought it was a great power outage. But no, it was the only light that flicker flicker twice, and that was it. And I just kind of had a feeling Maybe it was grandma letting us know that she was okay."
383.0,Provider,"yeah things they say things like that happen after people pass little messages you know, and these kind of ways to to. To extend love you know and connection and through these."
6867.0,Patient,"So, yesterday we spent the day in forming family and friends about it, and everything and. Today, we have to go to the funeral home and discuss if we're even going to have a service or not because of the co bid situation so. And even if it is going to be a service it's just going to be the immediate family that's here, because we all got our shots and. But we're not sure, but it's going to happen with that one so."
383.0,Provider,"Right right, so you have loose ends and things to take care of and."
6867.0,Patient,"Well now, of course, the other thing is that now that grandma's gone and we're living in her house. Eventually, the House will end up being sold, I think. Unless because I don't know because I asked because her mom or my wife's mother had a stroke, about two months ago. Right, so I have a feeling that her mom is not going to let us go with that easily because I think she's gonna be the next one we're gonna end up taking care of."
383.0,Provider,uh huh.
6867.0,Patient,"And we're already starting to in some ways, because I take her to all of her appointments because she can't drive anymore."
383.0,Provider,uh huh.
6867.0,Patient,So yeah we're kind of doing a date kind of doing it day but yeah it's still kind of a surreal situation right now.
383.0,Provider,"mm hmm. well. you've been a caregiver and seems to be a role that you. You fall into it. Do you feel I mean it seems like you look like you're doing pretty well, I mean how, how are you feeling."
6867.0,Patient,"Well, I think that's partly because of the Prozac because of Prozac kind of helps like raise my mood up a bit and everything like that. I mean i'm totally convinced that if I was on Prozac or anything like that i'd be right back into a dark dark scene and everything like that, like I am usually wouldn't death occurs. But. Overall, I had i'm handling it Okay, I think it's mainly because of the situation that she wasn't my blood relatives."
383.0,Provider,uh huh.
6867.0,Patient,"And then. She left she loved me like I was a blood relative and I loved her like she was a blood relative to, but I think it's mainly because I didn't know her since birth or whatever, maybe that's part of it, I don't know. But. I mean it was still it still kind of bothered me because she was making noise earlier in the day and I knew immediately what it was, it was like the the death rattle choke whatever because we are the same thing with my mother when she died and my dad when he died. So me and my wife knew immediately what it was so we just knew that. I feel we had ours."
383.0,Provider,Well that's that's. A call to be around I mean that's not an easy thing to experience and I.
6867.0,Patient,"Look, as the first time I ever found a dead body so that's that kind of that was kind of unnerving a bit."
383.0,Provider,"Sure, of course. I. You know well i'm glad that you saw Shannon towel and i'm glad that you got this medication that you're you know you I wish we could have gotten you taking that little bit sooner, but i'm glad that you're taking it now and it's helping you."
6867.0,Patient,"Better late than never, I guess. So now we're just doing right now we're just mainly taking care of finalizing all grandma's things and everything before we open up the next chapter of our lives so."
383.0,Provider,"Sure, but."
6867.0,Patient,"It is, but it is the first time in oh God ever since my wife and I got married but. as of right now it's just the two of us, because when we got married, we were taking care of somebody else. And after she died we immediately came here and started, taking care of grandma. So now for the so now, for the first time, is just us were like well. I guess, we have to figure out what to do with ourselves now."
383.0,Provider,Well um. yeah so any not that.
6867.0,Patient,"Well now, I mean we're finally going to we're going to take some opportunities and everything after this stuff settles down and finally go visit some family that have moved away and everything like that and. Finally, get out and do a few things, since we have this kind of newfound freedom, right now, so we're just not used to it yet."
383.0,Provider,well. i'm it's great that you're thinking about what you can you know what you can do in the next couple months I think good idea to.
6867.0,Patient,"But I also noticed that, one way or another, I think we're always going to be taking care of her family, because her mom like I said she her mother had a stroke and. Her mother, right now, has like short term memory loss that's the problem that she got from her stroke. and and want you to have a stroke are usually pretty susceptible susceptible to get him again so we're keeping a close eye on her. and her brother who I I love to death, he is my my brother in law and I love them to death, but he is also a little bit on the slow side, so he really can't take care of themselves either, so we so now like a lot of the responsibility is like going on me and Sarah to like take care of things."
383.0,Provider,"Okay, does this brother live with mom."
6867.0,Patient,"Yes, daily live like four houses, down from us so they're like right across the street."
383.0,Provider,"Is there anyone else living there, besides."
6867.0,Patient,my brother in law's friend lives there he's lived there for about four years.
383.0,Provider,"I see. Well, you know remember you have choices, you know. Everything it's good to remember that you do have a choice. It may seem like you don't, but there are choices with regards to what you. want to do know life, you know, and you and your wife."
6867.0,Patient,"Well, I seem to be I mean I seem to personally be more fulfilled when i'm like taking care of people. So I think like taking care of grandma like firmly convinced me that. caregiving is probably what I was meant to do. You know whether it was take care of grandma take care of whatever like that. I just had, I just had this feeling with that."
383.0,Provider,"Okay, well, if you feel. United, I just think that being clear and the choice you know, rather than that it's your choice and you feel called to do it, and so you make that choice. Rather than feeling kind of like the choice gets made for you. yeah your life. So. yeah."
6867.0,Patient,"But like today, not long after I get off with you as a matter of fact, we have to go to the mortuary and like I said and get that going to figure out. If we're ever going to have a service, I mean she already has a plot she already has a place where she's going to be buried. Where she's going to be buried next to her husband so and they figured that one out years and years and years ago so."
383.0,Provider,Well that's good you. know some of that some of those details are already taken care of and.
6867.0,Patient,"yeah at least it wasn't last minute like my mom when she passed away we just kind of had to like jump on that one blindly to get her buried but. With with grandma she at least have the presence of mind to get everything sorted out and everything, even before her husband died so."
383.0,Provider,yeah.
6867.0,Patient,it's like okay well at least as good at least you got a plan on what to do when it happens so.
383.0,Provider,that's good some of those responsibilities have been taken care of and they're not on you.
6867.0,Patient,"yeah the only like so right now the only thing, where we were canceling cards were trying to figure out her finances and everything like that, so I suspect it's still going to be a pretty frustrating and stressful couple of weeks, but. You know, at least until she gets buried so."
383.0,Provider,"uh huh do you anticipate any family conflicts surfacing during this time, or is."
6867.0,Patient,About as as of right now I don't foresee anything I mean we have. In the past we have had relatives that seem to be more interested in money and everything like that so it's we're just kind of like trying to gauge everybody. And it's and tell them straight up that you know that my wife's mother has the final say on what ever. And that's what and we're ever getting the point out to everybody that. The mom has the final say because the because grandma was her mother.
383.0,Provider,Right right and is is your wife's mother and have the presence of mind to make the choices are our did.
6867.0,Patient,"Well, well, yes, well, yes and no um because I mean she's having Sarah and I help out with things too because, like I said mom had a stroke so. So every now, then we have to call her at reminder did you take care of this, did you take care of that. And sometimes that should be like oh yeah I did or Oh, I need to or whatever like that so. So we're like trying to take some stop stuff off her plate so that way she doesn't get overloaded. So my wife is doing a lot of the stuff and i'm doing what I can, and everything and try to take as much off of mom's plate as possible, because we don't want to stress around, any more than she needs to be."
383.0,Provider,mm hmm. well.
6867.0,Patient,We don't need her to have another stroke.
383.0,Provider,"Sure right right, how are you doing with regards to your sobriety terms of how you're feeling and and."
6867.0,Patient,"Actually, very good, I mean I have it doesn't even enter my mind to tell you the truth. With everything. This is like there's like the first. Actual death i've gone through completely sober that in my dog. The first two deaths were the first two deaths, I went through completely sober so. i'm kind of allowing myself to feel the full impact and everything is instead of like hiding behind drugs like I used to so. And like I said, with the addition of the Prozac it seems to help."
383.0,Provider,that's great that's great Michael i'm I mean you hit a year mark right year a year mark of sobriety not long ago.
6867.0,Patient,"yeah a couple months ago, as a matter of fact. yeah August. August 27."
383.0,Provider,"Okay, so that's really. And I hope you take time. To just reflect on your own growth, you know and and also where do you want to go from here, you know, in terms of. Your future because."
6867.0,Patient,"Things will come in time, I believe I mean right now, like I said we're just learning to live with this newfound freedom or whatever like that. yeah we as we don't have a person to take care of full time anymore so. So now we're just trying to figure out okay. Well, we got the day to ourselves, what do we do."
383.0,Provider,"know I know it's such I I took care of my dad for many years and then you know he passed away, it was really kind of weird kind of Nice and. You know just different you know to Okay, well, I guess, I can take a walk and I don't have to think about you know when, am I going to swing by there to help her do this to do that and."
6867.0,Patient,"There it goes will house was like early quiet, right now, I mean yesterday morning when I woke up almost instinctively I went back to towards her bedroom at eight o'clock in the morning because that's usually, when a better breakfast. And they kind of stopped myself halfway and real and. Remember, no yeah she's not here. So it's it's gonna take me a minute to start like breaking those habits, I mean. It kind of changes my morning ritual now because i'm not doing the same things anymore. Right, I still. I still start my morning with prayer and I still do those morning things, but then, after a certain time, when I was supposed to take care of her all of a sudden it's like nothing."
383.0,Provider,"Right right. well. Are there any other self care things that you, you know goals that you'd like to kind of address just for your own health."
6867.0,Patient,"Maybe in the world and then finally eventually i'm gonna quit smoking eventually i've already started slowing down on it, but. Just not quite ready to quit just yet. But I have at least slow down on it, I don't smoke as much as I used to."
383.0,Provider,Go okay.
6867.0,Patient,Trying to make a conscious effort in that one.
383.0,Provider,yeah I think that's a good idea that you're. kind of introducing that idea to yourself. Small increments you know.
6867.0,Patient,"Because I wanted to get fully over one addiction and everything like that, before I try to tackle another one."
383.0,Provider,mm hmm.
6867.0,Patient,"Because, if you do both at the same time, or whatever, then unfortunately one's going to win out over the other so. I didn't want to do too many things all at one time so."
383.0,Provider,"Well i'm reducing that's the harm reduction approach, which is really a great approach for cutting smoking there's a California smoking cessation Program. that's actually pretty. Pretty it's pretty small. And they do take the lead i'm just gonna see if I can. Think. there's there's like. resources and also they give you. Assistance there's. And you can sometimes you could even get like gift cards. And and different things. So you might want to check that out online when you're ready it's called. quit assist.com."
6867.0,Patient,Let me write that down. Okay got it.
383.0,Provider,"So yeah they basically it's the California. Smoking cessation program and this quit assist. You can talk to a you know national cancer institute counselor on chat. there's you know quitting tips and coping with cravings and. You know, and this is for folks that are really have been you know smoke smoking for many year you know people that are. About you know how tobacco i've been smoking tobacco for a long time, so it just might be it just might be just a resource to take a look at when you're interested."
6867.0,Patient,"yeah I got a written down so yeah i'll definitely check into that eventually. But Besides that, like, I said that the main thing we're dealing with currently the current situation is just. finalizing all the grandmas things and. Getting her buried and. auntie and closing out her chapter, as they would say."
383.0,Provider,"Right right the accounts and all of those financial details and then i'll probably will be the House to talk about him so there's a lot of things still there for you to to manage, which will take your you know your mental health. To kind of get through those those things, so you is there anything that you do from groups that that's helpful to you, and that you can bring in to help."
6867.0,Patient,"Well, I mean when we were studying about like a like ptsd recognition and everything like that I really took that to heart cuz. I knew what ptsd was, but you know, and I am I know some of the things that brought it on and everything like that and. But you know when you did when you gave those lessons I kind of gave me like an idea of like how how certain things i'm how to like look look at it and how to handle it and how to approach it from maybe a different perspective and everything like that, so that helps as well."
383.0,Provider,"Okay, good, well, is there any I think so i'm going to look at your chart here, it looks like. The pH Q nine survey it, I mean I know you're very busy so maybe you can get that done before group on Thursday."
6867.0,Patient,yeah i'll definitely do that.
383.0,Provider,yeah and.
6867.0,Patient,I know I need to do my band seven to I didn't do that one yeah. I usually I usually take care of that one on Monday morning so.
383.0,Provider,"Okay okay good um and I think that you know there's been some cancellations, I know you've been super busy but it starts to pop up as."
6867.0,Patient,"The I know a lot of most of those are mainly. Issues that we have had with grandma and everything like that, because she was getting sicker and sicker and everything so."
383.0,Provider,"yeah So if you can just maybe. Maybe call before you're going to miss an appointment, if possible."
6867.0,Patient,"I tried to I tried to but like I said with grandma her situation was it was a day to day thing. Sometimes, it was a minute to minute thing, so you didn't know how she was going to action so sometimes that actually did it. yeah so."
383.0,Provider,No that's.
6867.0,Patient,That that's not going to be an issue now obviously so.
383.0,Provider,"Okay, well, I know you're I mean that's a really big deal taking care, I mean, yes, taking care of someone end of life is very much minute by minute so I may understand. So do you want to set up your next appointment and November."

Okay, the second the knife the 16th to the 23rd those are the only days i'm not available those those days, I have to take my mother lodge or physical therapy appointments and other doctors appointments."
