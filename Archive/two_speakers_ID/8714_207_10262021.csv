8714.0,Patient,know.
207.0,Provider,"The way you had it because I was like Oh, I see you. You know what maybe you know what now that you fast and you went like this, I think I know what it is you usually have it all pinned up. usually have it all pinned up day that day you had it like straightening long and. So how is it going to last time with the next."
8714.0,Patient,everything's going alright. New job brother. still doing the rehab thing you doing pretty good.
207.0,Provider,"I thought he moved to another location, I would get ready to go."
8714.0,Patient,"yeah he was getting ready to go to the tea House so he he's there now. he's out of the rehab facility into the tea house and now he's working and. Doing his thing. went up and visit with a couple weekends ago and. he's over it. He wants to leave, but then I asked him like well do you think you've gotten everything you needed out of this said no, like well."
207.0,Provider,Then you can go.
8714.0,Patient,"yeah but right before I came to visit them the weekend before that I guess all the guys that were in the tea house with him. relapsed. every single one of them, they were doing I think crystal meth or something."
207.0,Provider,How did he how did he survive that like if.
8714.0,Patient,"I was shocked I was, I mean i'm happy that he didn't like it, because he knew after a while he figured it out, obviously, you know everybody's acting weird. and Like he was the only one that stayed clean through the whole thing. But he's he's kind of frustrated right now, because they're like we don't believe you we don't believe you that you didn't do anything. yeah."
207.0,Provider,And it came out that he was clean. yeah so what what do they think he did something to mask.
8714.0,Patient,Exactly i'm not sure like they didn't. Like and that's why he's frustrated like what do they have no faith in this program or something like come on i'm here for a reason you know.
207.0,Provider,"While but what gave him because there's something to learn from it, even for yourself is because it sounds like he in for a moment he was in the line and then. Everybody got devoured devoured, why is it that he was the only one that fan."
8714.0,Patient,"He told me he would. You just go in his room like laughter he figured it out, because it was only probably like this was happened within like three or four days you know from what everybody started. Being weird I mean, and he works, a lot so while he's there, he is he's trying to work as much as possible, so I think he was able to stay away from everything and said when he got on it's like yeah dude was just acting completely different from solve just. All sorts of crazy, they would stay up and making food into the middle of the night. So I would just go in my room and lock it and. Go sleep well good."
207.0,Provider,wow but. But that's what what gave him the strength and the courage.
8714.0,Patient,"is just ready and then i'm hoping that's what it does and it's just ready to be done. With it, all I think a guilt like because I because I asked him one of his main things when. He gets out that i'm worried about is drinking like that was the worst like he did so many different kinds of drugs, but his drinking is the worst part of it all, so I asked him like so do you think you're going to drink when you get out. And is like I i'm not gonna lie I think about it. No, but then the guilt washes over me. Just from thinking about it. That makes sense, I mean he he was drinking 24 seven. Now, when he was living with me, he was up and up in the morning, when I was getting up to get my get ready for school, you know and i'd see him sneaking from the fridge running back to his room like you just made yourself a drink. At 630 in the morning 637 o'clock in the morning. I mean. He was able to laugh about it, and that was that was good, because I mean we spent the day together and I. Like you weren't a sneaky as you thought you were. You thought you were getting away with some stuff but you know seen it all. But I mean. It was like a mixture, you know of embarrassment and. Just laughing about it."
207.0,Provider,"i'm. interesting because um. You know what what is for him, like what keeps him grounded like what keeps him wanting sobriety. In comparison to going back into his whole time it's like what is his driver what is what is driving his motivation."
8714.0,Patient,I think it's me. I think it's what he and his son. That he. wants to have a relationship with he hasn't he hasn't for. 1010 years at least. 15 now.

And the one time I got to talk to him a few months ago we were on like a three way call video call. It was first time I got to see his face, you know and see him in person and. He was telling us that his mom. compares him to my brother all the time. Just like your father you're gonna grow up to be just like him."

Now, on off calling them like you need to take him i'm done over it i'm done just take them just take it, and then the next day oh nevermind. So as."

207.0,Provider,I know your. your mother passed away right. Does your dad still living. And you guys have a relationship with your dad.
8714.0,Patient,"I mean we do. team I think my brother has a little bit more of a relationship with him than I do. we're civil we talk, when we talk, but you know we don't. You don't go out of our way to communicate with each other."
207.0,Provider,gotcha gotcha so you're the only sister that you like a. sibling it's just you and your brother.
8714.0,Patient,yeah and then we have an older brother as well.
207.0,Provider,And you guys have a relationship with him. So you guys so it's just the three of you then. When you guys are fairly close.
8714.0,Patient,"yeah I mean my oldest brother is probably I mean. We talk, but he's he's got a busy life he's got five daughters. and he's an engineer and he's constantly flying around the country and. Please just a busy guy and."
207.0,Provider,You need anything.
8714.0,Patient,for that.
207.0,Provider,Are you.
8714.0,Patient,"yeah. my daughter actually chats with them through messenger kids on her phone a lot. Like I talked to them a lot. My oldest nieces there like kind of. ones in college kind of doing their own thing, and the other one is like in that teenage area where. Everybody socks. So we'll let her get through that phase."
207.0,Provider,"Because it is a face, it is such a thing yeah everybody nobody knows anything but. So you understand what I was saying what my nephew. Everything. So all they all go. Now, is it that for you you're hoping that or even for him does even think that far is that one day you all, will be able to reunite and be able to function and just kind of communicate and operate as a healthy family free and clear of any type of dependencies."
8714.0,Patient,I would love that that's definitely. A dream of mine.
207.0,Provider,So when you said you go to visit him it's just you alone.
8714.0,Patient,"I mean, sometimes I take my fiancee and daughter."
207.0,Provider,Your dad has never gone.
8714.0,Patient,"i'm not sure if he's gone up there yet. I don't think so. I know my brother's car is currently at my dad's House so he needs to bring that up to them. So I imagine he'll come visit here soon, but. that's actually where Jeff was before he went into rehab was at my dad's House for a little while. Now he had a he had a i'm not sure if I told you about at all, but he had this kind of crazy thing happened. Because he was living in North Carolina. You know lying to me about you know everything that happened down there for a while started using. It got really, really bad and. ended up quitting his job and just taking off, you know my my oldest brother actually went down flew down there. And rented a car that got my brother and drove them backup upstate. And took him in to his house. You know, to help them out a little bit and. Then, my money my brother, and you know I think I told you before he he had a car accident, where he had a seizure and he was in the hospital almost almost died. So while he was at my brother's house he had another seizure and it. scared the crap out of my oldest brother, I mean those. Pretty intense were like he. was on the ground, just seizing forming from the mouth and then, when he was coming."
207.0,Provider,To my brother.
8714.0,Patient,"yeah the one that's in rehab right now yeah. So when he was coming to us, you know flailing around like didn't know where he was and. My oldest brother ended up running out of the House, because he was afraid that he was going to get attacked like because he was just that, out of it. ended up saying you know I can't have you in my house with my kids you know Luckily, the kids weren't there at the time. And then. So my brother ended up at my dad's house and I had to talk to both of them my my oldest brother and my dad and i'm like well has he had anything to drink. And my oldest brother said no. That might be the reason that. You know you got off balance. So dependent on drinking and using any was clean for a few days. Withdrawing and. Just didn't tell anybody."
207.0,Provider,If they had been committed to at least overall has he committed to even doing counseling even after him he.
8714.0,Patient,um he hasn't said anything I haven't asked them either so. I should probably talk about that. For sure. it's not just over once you leave.
207.0,Provider,"Absolutely Okay, so when I go back to Africa, he said that you know I said, what is the driver for him and you said, I believe it, you know you and his son now what is it about us that he what he sees that is a motivator for him."
8714.0,Patient,"well. Because growing up, it was just. When it really came down to it, it was me my brother and my mom. So. I am the closest person to him. we've just been through so much together."
207.0,Provider,"What is um you said, your if you your brother and your mom your dad like what he working a lot like what was going on with her bag like when he just funding."
8714.0,Patient,"Well, they they were divorced, when I was eight years old. he's down in the state, he just works and works more than once the divorce happened. We just stopped communicating so much, even when we lived in the same town. i'm. months and months without seeing talking to."
207.0,Provider,"you or your brother going, you know dad for things that has transpired and."
8714.0,Patient,"I will yeah. Just just out of anger, you know. from him not being around or anything. it's like he didn't do anything it's just that's the I guess the problem is he didn't do anything. wrong."
207.0,Provider,"But. Does he because I know you talked about like feeling that responsibility and feeling like your mom kind of put. That on you prior to her dying and so you feel that added responsibility to pretty much take her place especially your brother is concerned, right and we talked about that, like you're is become that much more harder on yourself because maybe you don't feel like you are. Keeping to what it is. You know mom asked you to do. So."
8714.0,Patient,It sounds like i'm capable. Right.
207.0,Provider,"it's not that you're not just capable that's that's a big burden to put on yourself because you're you're a young individual that you know your sister and his mother. And you have your own child and your own life that you're living and, yes, you can be here to be as supportive. As much as possible, but in the same way there's only so much that mom and get back to do at the end of the day, it's his it's his responsibility, just like we talked about with you, you know you. Choosing the road of recovery us choosing to do the work and be committed remember, we talked about in group that commitment to not just recovery, but everything that comes along being on this journey that's what you're committing to you're committing to. The hills and The Valleys and everything that you're going to have to cross and all of that that's your commitment you're not committed to. The word or the title of recovery, but recovery comes with a lot of recovery comes with letting go of past acquaintances who recovery comes with learning how to. set boundaries, where it needs to be recovery comes with knowing pre prioritizing and staying committed to those things in order to maintain that recovered commit. Recovery comes with and that commitment comes with forgiving and letting go and knowing and understanding when I save this for serenity prayer I have to understand what. It is i'm saying like you can recite us and you can recite a line all day long, but then, at some point in time, you got to look what that the dog online is saying. and commit to exactly what it's saying is letting go and knowing what I have control over and what I don't. that's what when you look at the 12 steps and you read everything you have to commit to that till recovery is just a word, but are you committed to, and so, if you for yourself can do that. You are committed to wanting to be the mom that you need to be to your daughter you're committed to wanting to be that fiance or being a wife to someone if you're committed to that, then at the end of the day. He has to also commit to what recovery comes with he has to be committed to that and that is something that you don't in conversation is asking him what are you committed to, because then, if he says well i'm committed to this recovery i'm committed to my sobriety. What does that mean for you. Because if you're not committed to whatever it is taking it is not going to be hard for you to realize that the rest of the guys when you see everybody doing but it's a party over here you are bad, why are you not partying with us and, eventually, what happened. is going to be what I had my my soul, which is the truth day. you're not going to come over here. So while he overcame that one big temptation and you were the only one standing in the lion's den the die and devoured everything the lion being crystal meth devoured everybody else, and it will you're the only one that was able to hold your ground. If you do not re evaluate your commitment on a daily basis, the next time that temptation comes with to say you're falling. You have to hold on to what is it that you're committing to if it is, I mean, I want to stay committed to my son it's reevaluating why, for you personally for you, you need to stay committed to yourself, because I don't want to be the dad that I don't want to be like my dad. What does that mean for you. The understand what does that mean, because what it means for me were siblings right I don't want to be like a, let us mom for a second or either I don't want to be like my mom that statement means something different for me. than it means for you, but we grew up with the same month we grew up in the same House we were close to the same things. But me not wanting to turn out like mom means something very different, for me, then, it means for you well, we have to both identify what that is and that's what we work to change. And so, for your brother it's as you go through your own recovery and art maintain your sobriety as you go through it for yourself, you have to understand the meaning each and every day, I think it was in group someone says, when we talk about. What is it that we're thankful for and someone said it's it's one foot in front of the other for them taking it one foot in front of the other. But then, as you put one foot in front of the other it's you have to be able to identify what did I overcome today what did I surpassed today what challenges was I faced with today and how did I cope with it, how did I get through it. i'm just telling you my story, you have to hear what it is i'm saying and make what is applicable to you applicable to you, and what you need to tweak tweak it for you. So, if it is you know hey I want to maintain a relationship with my sister. i'm here, and I would love to maintain a relationship with you, you my day one. can stand and if you might do once we both have to, we have to set boundaries, and we have to work within the realm of those boundaries. And I would love for us to go back to or try to be rebuilt, what we want to have, but let me tell you what my sobriety mean for me, and I can only share it with you this is the commitment i've had to make. What are the commitment you're willing to make and keep them. Commitment means that i'm gonna have to bite my tongue when I don't really feel like biting my tongue. In group with this somebody said. it's learning how to bite my tongue because. She said, my job, I really felt like having the hood come out of them, but I had to bite my tongue. You remember she said, I really wanted the hood to come out of me, but I hold my tongue because, if I didn't. What is going to immediately i'm going to feel satisfied because i've done gave you a tongue lashing But then what comes behind that. The possibility of losing my job, not being able to pay my bills not being able to maintain everything that i've built up to this far, simply because that one little second of satisfaction just became a lifetime of destruction one second. of fact satisfaction to my flesh has just tore down a lifetime of building. And so the commitment to my sobriety what does that mean and then sharing with your brother, when you meet with him and asking him what are you committed to what exactly are you in hearing what he thinks, what are you committed to. Because the truth of the matter is. You can be. an unofficial counselor for your brother and just saying hey, this is what i've learned to my groups or my therapies to my vista my back to my journey being in my relationship, being a mom what i've learned, and this is what I can share with you, what are you taking away from it. For you i'm happy that you weren't devoured by. The lion being crystal meth. But it comes up again huh."
8714.0,Patient,It was a relief hearing.
207.0,Provider,"But I wanted to continue to be that i'm not saying that we don't fall once in a while. i'll say that we don't fall, we all do we all slip up here and there, because we justify it in our head in order for me to succumb to this conversation I justified in my head, but. Once I re evaluate my commitment. To this journey. The next time this temptation comes along. it's going to be challenging but I can overcome it again. Because I daily. evaluate what is my commitment to this journey. What does it mean for me. Jenny I think one of the things that could possibly help you is to say, to yourself, every day, when it comes down to your brother. I love you you're my brother."
8714.0,Patient,I need to say that to him.
207.0,Provider,"I love you because you are my brother. But I am much. I will not be your mom and I cannot be your mom but what I can do is not stop loving you. But sometimes love hurts. If it means that he gets to that place where he calls it, you say i'm not answering the phone girl cry if you need practice cry why you get a phone line cry why you look at that miss call. But don't what you it's sometimes you have to put those I am your sister, and I will love you until the day you go or ICO but what I will never be is your mother. What I cannot meet with your mother. What I cannot be is your Daddy, but I can always be your sister. But when you say that to him, you have to believe it. The only person, you can be a mother to is the child that you have unless you have a few more. But the only person, you can be a mother to is the child that you have the only person that you can be a wife or a partner to is the men, naturally. But you cannot be that for him. I love you, I am not your mother unnatural girlfriend unnatural fiance and that's just a little weird for me to say that. I am not. I am only your sister, and I will love you. So you believe it and I think even in saying nothing it letting him understanding the role he has to his attorney and the role you act to your journey. you're both on your both are embarking on a journey of healing. Right, you may be a little farther on that journey. So it gives you the upper hand, why do you think it gives you the upper hand. Think about it we're both traveling. traveling. i'm back here and you're further ahead, why does it give you the upper hand."
8714.0,Patient,Because I already know where I want to be. able to think about.
207.0,Provider,"I know what is. In between the distance between me and. I know what it's in between that distance is kind of like going back to your name, where you said that she's at that teenage stage where she hates everybody and they did they got correct figure out right honey, I am 20 years older than you. I was there. It means that I have 20 years of experience in knowing where you're about to head. So your upper hand is that we're both on this journey of healing you're here, I am here. The distance between me and you is that I have a little bit more knowledge, so I know the mountain the valleys that you're about to see I know the feelings and the emotions, I know what you're about to feel i've been to it, so I can only look back and say hey. Be careful. there's going to be a pothole ahead so prepare yourself to maneuver around it. how you look because don't go on it already seen it that's, the only way I can tell you is there. Someone saying you're ahead you're behind okay after you get past that pothole there's going to be a few Spikes in the road, so you have to take your time you're gonna have to take your time, and this is how you're going to get through that how you know. Because i've already been there. The question is, as you talk to your brother, and as you continue on your journey is asking you what is your commitment. Because with that commitment, these are all the things that i've been through this fall and, at the end of the day, Jamie. You have to be honest with yourself as to where you are and what you've been through you don't. it's not so much being honest with me is being honest with yourself. You have to be honest with yourself because through that honesty, as you share it with him. You know that i'm coming from a pure place when i'm telling you what i'm telling you in comparison to i'm telling you what i'm telling you, but when you ain't around I go sit now I have my bottle nobody knows I got my body, so let me know I have my back. it's nothing but if you don't have a bottle you know that you're coming from a true and honest. So i'm going to encourage you to continuously always remember to tell your brother whenever you talk to him. Before you and not enjoy your time with him I love you, I just want you know I love you. But I just need to tell you is your mom and I. could be here to support you as much as I can, when I enter a moment. I can never be there, I can always just be. A little different from your mom. taught me whatever. Let me look at my calendar. Okay."
8714.0,Patient,"I work all nights now so. Right now, I have Mondays and Thursdays off."
207.0,Provider,"Okay, and you're on every every."
8714.0,Patient,Every two weeks for counseling or the group counseling monthly prescriptions.
207.0,Provider,"Because what I could do is I could put you on a Monday. for individual on the off day that you include. Monday Monday and Thursday. You know, we can before. We can do. I have you attempted it on the 18th of November. it's a Thursday yeah. um and you just use your uds of the 23rd should be fine. You did get your medication."
8714.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
207.0,Provider,"yeah so I show them that you don't you're you're in compliance with everything the show razor uds everything so you're good, and so I will see you on the 18th that will be the exact same table for that they were supposed to go. Alright man have a good one thing."
