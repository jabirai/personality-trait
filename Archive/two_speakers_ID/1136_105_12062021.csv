105.0,Provider,James.
1136.0,Patient,morning.
105.0,Provider,morning. Well we're almost there. If the video buttons that I can see you. There you go. Happy belated birthday.
1136.0,Patient,Oh wow Thank you.
105.0,Provider,yeah oh my gosh.
1136.0,Patient,"I forgot my little nephews birthdays today but mine you're so good, we went to the flea market, but all kinds of stuff toys and everything. To the kids and things to make for them, it was nice my brother took me applebee's."
105.0,Provider,See got a chance to feel special.
1136.0,Patient,"Yes, I did feel special. So first birthday i've actually been able to enjoy without drugs or alcohol. mm hmm really good I like it, I like to change."
105.0,Provider,And you can remember what you did.
1136.0,Patient,"Sometimes I can remember you know, but most of the time it's. It takes me a while to remember something I don't know why I have such a trouble with the short term memory might be in my brain injuries that i've have."
105.0,Provider,"likely, so you are home, it looks like. i'm just taking a second to create a note for us. You have some privacy today."
1136.0,Patient,"Yes, I do."
105.0,Provider,"Okay, good. So, because we have. There we go. haven't met. there's been some missed appointments it's just means that i'm going to need to review your goals with you, I don't like to do it every time we meet, but when you miss appointments, then I keep having to just focus there, but I don't. don't want to. I would like to focus elsewhere so let's just move through these quickly, just a quick statement, and then we will move into. Other areas of discussion. When if you were to describe yourself, regarding your ability to be patient it's one of your goals is to see yourself be more patient. And what I was encouraging you to do was use a particular breathing technique when you got frustrated. And i'm wondering, have you remembered to do that."
1136.0,Patient,"No, I haven't."
105.0,Provider,Okay well that's fine in the sense that you might still be experiencing some progress in your ability to be patient How do you assess whether you've been making progress or not around patients.
1136.0,Patient,"Well, the the medical part of it's good. I think it's successful i'm getting better."
105.0,Provider,"So, give me an example of when you feel boy I was more patient than I might have been a year ago."
1136.0,Patient,"whoa. Like when i'm wrong we're doing something wrong and I get told like. Then you realize hey, why should have just been patient or I try to be patient with that person or lover i'm dealing with. I tried to be patient because I can't control my mind I don't think I can and that's just how I am and i've been that way forever and it's hard for me to learn. I have a learning disability as well and it just it gets pretty frustrating I get mad at myself sometimes like i'm tired in games like the goal hop to myself, like that. yeah and that's pretty much it just when i'm. Like. i'm just patient, you know I just okay take a breather and also cool what. You already go."
105.0,Provider,And do fun or creative things.
1136.0,Patient,Like what I do funny crazy thing.
105.0,Provider,"i'm good trend volume up. This is something you want. You want to do fun or creative things and what I encourage you to do was engage in activities or hobbies at least one hour each day. Do it's a do it's a verb do so engage is just a fancy word for do. For example, fun activities on a it's been over a month since we've met. So, are you doing things each day some sort of hobby activity that you enjoy."
1136.0,Patient,i'm doing a hobby today somewhat of a hobby.
105.0,Provider,Okay.
1136.0,Patient,"We will be working on stuff and I like these cars are painting them all up and stuff but uh that's like a hobby. that's like all I got going right now. Okay, but it'll be the word work there'll be ideas, but I definitely ain't spending an hour, how many times a day, did you say."
105.0,Provider,"Oh, you. know."
1136.0,Patient,The week.
105.0,Provider,Right just we were. So when it says his client will engage in hobbies activities at least one hour each day.
1136.0,Patient,"What i've tried to do it, an hour a day because I love what i'm doing and I just got to be more cleaner at it, you know not my pleasure man."
105.0,Provider,"Well, you and I have talked about maybe creating in your room a workbench did you."
1136.0,Patient,"Get that. You were will Shell for my room and I don't even have it, I don't even use it as a desk it's like kind of awkward so I just started putting everything on in piled up. I just filled it up with things that I. Like, for instance, got some candles glass panels I collect those and. Those are big cross that I made just know things like that little trinkets or whatever and they're all means something to me, I like I can just throw them away, but maybe I need to I don't know. But yeah I put that desk if there me and my brother didn't I using it."
105.0,Provider,So what do you think of you that that's what you ended up doing was creating it but not using it for its purpose. What do you think of you that that happened.
1136.0,Patient,"know that I wasn't doing those of what you said to do three times a week and. kinda. I don't know way I don't have time for it because we're always working, but when i'm not working, maybe I should take it all off whatever's on there and do some arts and crafts on it, but what did you say again."
105.0,Provider,You created the workbench in your room and ended up covering it with things that are not. With all of the tools paint brushes and all the hobby material. So that when you walk in the room. You could start one of your hobbies.
1136.0,Patient,"Well that's good I like that you know what i'm going to clear it off, now that we're meeting regularly."
105.0,Provider,uh huh.
1136.0,Patient,"Hopefully this will get better which I go will get better because i'm i'm, to the point where I want to get a little challenge you know to start doing more arts and crafts, or whatever it might be a little model or whatever. But I am kind of refresh dragon that I just totally like forgot about the arts and crafts. I don't know."
105.0,Provider,"So part of when you say Okay, I have a poor memory so listen if it's already out if all of the material to make a cross to do wood carving to do painting to do some of the fun things that you enjoy if it's already out. it's a que it's a visual cue with your eyes to go do it when it's tucked away in another room it's harder to remember to do it that's what this workbench was for and so that. You could also start it and leave the mess out and not upset your brother that's why you were creating this spend. If you remember that. So you could start something and not have to disrupt your brother's sense of comfort of moving around."
1136.0,Patient,"trophy to cover comfort do it on my desk got it. i'm excited to get all that. I have arts and crafts, to do at least you know, I have a lot of material and stuff I can make things out of process. uh huh and to remember that there's still that little bit of hope if I just clear it off. start a project, you know if I make a little some little things out like pink or blue or anything out just leave it there, so this way when I see it, I hate when said, you know here only when you see that stuff."
105.0,Provider,"that's right. Yes, and. How about when you're at work, sometimes your impatience shows up at work, you get frustrated with maybe not knowing how to do a particular thing and having to practice it over and over. How has your irritability been has there been a lot of irritability and impatience at work or very little."
1136.0,Patient,"Knowing patients at work that's what I do that's what I know how to do so i'm not. You know I don't have to prove anything, what I do, is what I do it's good you know something i'm good at, so I don't get frustrated or nothing like that. my brother might get frustrated with me a little bit, but I don't."
105.0,Provider,"Okay, so it might be being able to manage his frustration, so it is he critical does he say critical things about your work performance."
1136.0,Patient,"No he doesn't he just brings them up like sometimes we'll be sitting down or whatever and you'll see you need to work on this and maybe that. Was. not really that bad I mean. he's dealing with me so that's a big plus. And I just thank God every day that I have my brother, to help me like that you're helping me. Whatever I want to do you know he's supportive and like I said I thank God that we're where we are."
105.0,Provider,"Another goal, you have is, I would like to progress in life."
1136.0,Patient,that's what that you rolled out that I said.
105.0,Provider,"Yes, it is yes that's your phrasing that's definitely not my kind of terminology that's your kind of terminology. uh huh so when you assess yourself, when you look at yourself and sort of, say, oh i'm making progress or i'm not in life, what do you think of how your progress in life is coming along."
1136.0,Patient,"Very good, my progress is very good."
105.0,Provider,"Okay, go into some specifics about what you think. is very good. Specifically, what."
1136.0,Patient,work. we're. Making processes. collected little cars. Fixing things. and When I was watching movies quite a bit because that look like in the movie I stand and watch.
105.0,Provider,"This is so you're asking me it's an interesting thing is to ask me whether you're making progress in your life, you are going to be the judge of whether you're making progress not me. Do you. find that understanding a movie is progress for you."
1136.0,Patient,Yes.
105.0,Provider,"Okay, because there were times, maybe when you didn't."
1136.0,Patient,i'm not stressed out to sit on the couch watch movies and oprah. me. yeah I think it is.
105.0,Provider,"OK so that's progress. mm hmm okay. And this, one might be a little bit more difficult, but this is one of your goals some mine, it is, I want to increase confidence."
1136.0,Patient,I want to increase confidence.
105.0,Provider,So trying to see what is your confidence.
1136.0,Patient,"My confidence is for me and brother my brother to get a shop. and your work, stand up for the bosses you don't do it on your own shop can find one rented. and progress you don't make it work."
105.0,Provider,"Ah, oh that's interesting, so this thing you just said. It might be under the wrong note progress for you would be owning your own shop with your brother and running it independent of bosses and you'd be your own bosses just YouTube."
1136.0,Patient,yeah for now. And then he has a couple of guys that you were higher higher room. might be a four man crew.
105.0,Provider,uh huh okay.
1136.0,Patient,"But that's kind of like a wearable progress, I think, like something to look forward to."
105.0,Provider,"So that would be a that would actually be a goal. Bold oh confidence so, for example, confidence is, I think I can do something. i'm confident, I can do something so that's a feeling state inside of one self confidence so. So for someone that does not have confidence, they might be insecure they might be scared a lot they might be afraid, a lot. Do you have fear and anxiety, a lot of the time."
1136.0,Patient,"Oh no this abductions, having me. Fear nothing."
105.0,Provider,"Another area that you have is maintain employment. i'd like to close this one, because you've already done it for months, you have worked with your brother."
1136.0,Patient,isn't that right.
105.0,Provider,"Yes, but let's just put achieved and close that one as a successful because you've been able to maintain employment."
1136.0,Patient,"i've been, how do you say they can."
105.0,Provider,"maintain maintain, which means keep. nicely done."
1136.0,Patient,Thank you.
105.0,Provider,"let's talk a little bit about. You have mentioned at some points. concerns of depression i'd like to know whether your sleep you're eating your motivation your enjoyment of activities kind of touch on some of those areas of your life, so I can check in on depression."
1136.0,Patient,You prefer depression was then again i'm calling it suboxone help me all the measures like eight is helping me I feel like i'm. Making it.
105.0,Provider,sets the mood you feel most days.
1136.0,Patient,"Most days. Most days would be when we're on the way to work, knowing that we have work. And having all the tools to do the work."
105.0,Provider,"So a mood. So, for example, i'm going to ask that again i'll say what mood, are you in most of the time moods happy i'm happy, most of the time okay so that's really the opposite of depression, so you do not have a lot of depression sadness and fear throughout the day is that right."
1136.0,Patient,that's right.
105.0,Provider,"Okay Well, this is that lovely i'm so glad. Now, you said that you have some learning disability and bright health has all of these tasks that you have to do like fill out surveys and. login to a virtual clinic and show up here. Can you share a little bit about maybe some progress that you've made in learning how to do them independently, you made any progress there."
1136.0,Patient,"Oh yes, I have it, you said uh yeah I have, I want to really."
105.0,Provider,tell me what you're doing now that you weren't able to do a few months ago.
1136.0,Patient,"What i'm doing now, there was a few months ago. uh huh well keep you keeping my room clean. keep my stuff in order my arts and crafts are all in 30 boxes real little that's the shelf and. Try to make my bed every day. Just little things like that."
105.0,Provider,And is there any sense of concern over lonely.
1136.0,Patient,lonely no.
105.0,Provider,Okay.
1136.0,Patient,"I don't think so, I mean I got my brother here."
105.0,Provider,And what about boredom.
1136.0,Patient,"boredom boredom. is better than being out on the streets are. messing around out there you never know what's going to happen. Like you, thank God that he that we can sit there and watch TV if we know it's be bored I know. Okay, better there's no."
105.0,Provider,"you're not making it bigger than it is boredom doesn't have to be the end of the world, you don't have to go and get high."
1136.0,Patient,Nothing like that. The call up the craving or anything like that. I don't have a mobile.
105.0,Provider,i'm glad. So. just going to check again asking about learning new skills.
1136.0,Patient,Like what skills learning new skills well the pain body gets all learning. So what am I brother has me doing different grips of sandpaper to do different things I gotta remember that so next time he don't have to tell me I just do it myself I learned how to mix pain.
105.0,Provider,"So do you remember, on your own which grit sandpaper to use."
1136.0,Patient,You still telling me you still keeping real like teaching me about the grits. Okay earning a living i'm not. A professional yet where I want to be. yeah it's working.
105.0,Provider,And in mixing paint have you been independent doing it on your own a little bit more.
1136.0,Patient,"Yes, just a little bit more."
105.0,Provider,Little more little more.
1136.0,Patient,"Time to train the paint to put in the gun or whatever it's still, including the painful yes."
105.0,Provider,"So the thing is that I can see, for example, were you able to get the video on this morning. by yourself and."
1136.0,Patient,know my brother get it for me.
105.0,Provider,Or did that okay.
1136.0,Patient,I can do it. You know I mean that's just something I can't maybe either practice more I don't know I get just.
105.0,Provider,"So, for example, if."
1136.0,Patient,You wanted to throw my phone on the concrete if you. Understand that that's how frustrated I am with myself having to do that. And it was something about me I might sound dumb or crazy but.
105.0,Provider,No.
1136.0,Patient,value because I don't want to do it.
105.0,Provider,"Well, it might not be just that the screens themselves have words and some of those words, do you know all the words that you're looking at. Okay, so it isn't a matter of reading it might be maybe remembering each step. That might be the hard part is remembering the steps."
1136.0,Patient,really shows me every time I still can do it.
105.0,Provider,"Just now. If you were to mute yourself well let's see there might be more progress there, then you realize, if you want them. Yes, but you did it."
1136.0,Patient,"You ever learn that but I finally learned it I could get in through virtual clinic. I could do it myself, I guess, I could say that I could do it, maybe I gotta swallow this one and just hey you know, maybe I just wanted easy that my brother do it will change right."
105.0,Provider,Why do you.
1136.0,Patient,"think the part really you know, but I don't I don't try to but maybe i'm too comfortable people doing things for me and. i'm just like whoa. get me on the."
105.0,Provider,Is it easy.
1136.0,Patient,"There, so I would like to try it again. If lately i've been just just put me on the phone. they'll put me on it and. i'm all right, with it, but now that you're bringing it to my awareness i'm more like you know what you need to start doing your own thing."
105.0,Provider,So watch confidence watch if you were doing it yourself don't you think your confidence will go up now.
1136.0,Patient,I think. That the surveys and stuff. Okay we're even a little hard to get into for me.
105.0,Provider,"I haven't done any so I don't even you know I can't even picture what all the steps are for that. So maybe in the coming weeks, see if you can log into a group on your own that has the fewest steps, I think, because you don't have to go to virtual clinic you don't have to come to you know before this session, you have to go to virtual clinic first here, you can come straight here okay."
1136.0,Patient,Like I think different like room I think reverse. I hated it bodes i'm like the reverse.
105.0,Provider,tell me what your thought.
1136.0,Patient,"Well, what i'm thinking about was I thinking about. If i'm happy, I mean hold on a minute. If I can do that log in by myself. That would be a. good thing for me."
105.0,Provider,And you lost your train of thought just now.
1136.0,Patient,You know I got it bad.
105.0,Provider,"Because what you were saying was Oh, I think, in reverse, and then you got distracted and never came back to I think in reverse I didn't explain what that was. What does that mean I think in reverse and you get frustrated by that."
1136.0,Patient,won't be walking backwards. How can I explain it. But lost it again. How I can. get it back or do it more.
105.0,Provider,"Now these are your words I think in reverse, and I was trying to understand what that meant what that experience was like for you to think in reverse I was just curious if you had."
1136.0,Patient,"A little there was a there was a key thing that you said that made me think like that, and then I forgot about it, like like my mind would something else."
105.0,Provider,"Right going to virtual clinic for individual therapy, but not group. And then you said. And then you said ah, I think, in reverse, so you may have thought Oh, maybe i'm supposed to check into virtual clinic before group that would be reversed right, so you knew what you were thinking."
1136.0,Patient,"about what I said yes. No key word about what I just said, I could get it, but. it's been kind of hard for me lately."
105.0,Provider,"It wouldn't be hard, if your memory isn't there for you. How do you remember to make your bed."
1136.0,Patient,Because that's something you have to do.
105.0,Provider,"No, no, no, that you know you. Like you have a way of remembering the bed, I want to know how you do it."
1136.0,Patient,"I get up and I could kind of see in there and the benefits all messed up like. You know either will make it. I don't just get up out of bed take a shower and make it or make it and get in the shower. I got a workout work on i'm doing it, little by little."
105.0,Provider,The reason I brought it up was. If it isn't in words up a reminder. What would be a reminder of the steps. on how to login.
1136.0,Patient,"Oh little sticky pads little sticky also write it in my book, right here. So this this this and that and see if it works, but don't ever work for me when I was trying to get this a speaker to go on it wouldn't work for me my brother came and put it on right away. Maybe i'm touching it the wrong way I."
105.0,Provider,"Well, I don't know either, but, for example. You pressing it multiple times like that. So that won't work you have to press it once and let technology catch up like you don't keep tapping it you just do it. You see, that might be all the difference is again and that would be just understanding that you know when you press a key you just press it once. And if the computer doesn't respond which that's what your phone is basically a computer when it doesn't respond you wait. And then you go hmm Let me try it again, you press it again, but if you're doing this tap tap tap it's not going to work you have to tap it and wait so that's where that patient comes in again. You may know."
1136.0,Patient,"One thing I don't like and I don't think i'll ever like it. as of right now there's anything to do with any kind of phone anything I just don't like it. Just for now, I guess, I mean it just. I don't like it. don't like computers. I just don't like it."
105.0,Provider,I think that will change over time.
1136.0,Patient,"Probably but. i've just had so much interference and so much do this and you can't do this and it's not just my brother, I was at my other brothers to in the neighbor tried to do it would be me. And my brother and we still can get in I didn't even get it and I had to miss my appointment and I miss my meds when you don't have the message that suboxone you get sick."
105.0,Provider,yeah oh yeah.
1136.0,Patient,"So just because of the phone, I just have bad experiences with it."
105.0,Provider,And it's.
1136.0,Patient,I don't know. Maybe I know how and I just don't have confidence to do it.
105.0,Provider,"yeah for you it's probably connected to a withdrawal symptoms so you're very you're you're not wanting to to try and check in yourself, because he has such a bad experience with it. I can see why that would be difficult. But again."
1136.0,Patient,"Life spent 10 years in prison, I used to this stuff. You know just hard to get into it within time i'll get it. i'm going to give up, but I don't like them computers. Nothing is a chronic I don't like. Maybe i'll get started liking it. my brother bought me a radio. I don't know how to use that."
105.0,Provider,"Okay. And do you like car engines, do you like being in their."
1136.0,Patient,"diet low car engines and stuff like that, yes. someday I hope to build my own engine I probably I can do it, but there's a few things i've learned before I can actually build an engine. i'm gonna have to build it, but all the specs and all the things that you know how to get adjusted won't be right. Price to rebuild an engine my myself."
105.0,Provider,That would take a lot of.
1136.0,Patient,memory on the computer or a boy.
105.0,Provider,yeah.
1136.0,Patient,"i've learned before the sequences to tighten down the heads and get them in the sequence and everything's intake carburetor started it. And I was young, when I get that. Just a 15 years ago."
105.0,Provider,"Things that. you've been going through over this month, because the only time i've seen you has been in group haven't seen you in individual therapy."
1136.0,Patient,Get fairly I need the individual therapy and when I made from so pissed off and it comes again my brother didn't read it on the calendar.
105.0,Provider,"So, for example, last night."
1136.0,Patient,You didn't. brother reminded me. My brother's reminded me that. you've got an appointment with when.
105.0,Provider,tomorrow.
1136.0,Patient,"Okay, most of them at some point."
105.0,Provider,uh huh okay.
1136.0,Patient,"Well, let me I was by myself, I don't think that we're going. To you guys call number, the war right oh I missed one."
105.0,Provider,How do you wake up in the morning.
1136.0,Patient,I wake up in the morning. kinda. kinda like. Just ready to get coffee normally wake up.
105.0,Provider,Let me.
1136.0,Patient,Change the question open.
105.0,Provider,your eyes just open or an alarm goes off.
1136.0,Patient,"No mines just open every day at six o'clock. 630 not the way, ladies."
105.0,Provider,How do you remember that you want coffee.
1136.0,Patient,pretty much what I sit down and i'm like i'm missing something like it will make some coffee.
105.0,Provider,"Really nope. So you're missing something okay. Remembering i'm just trying to figure out things that you already do. That we can. So for the bed it's visual, you can see the beds messy. What not always."
1136.0,Patient,know. not always.
105.0,Provider,And you don't have any you don't have any.
1136.0,Patient,"I don't always make it, but every couple of days or whatever. Okay, every day, though I made it this morning. So this is one day that I actually had a little bit energy when I got up to me. and others and awake you know once I take suboxone i'm. me again I feel like I can do nothing without it. now get up right away, you know my body's hurting or whatever, what if I didn't have that what am I gonna do go to the hospital tomorrow, all my bones are already my brain surgeon everything's hurting what do I do. You know I just. Know there's been times my mission appointment and you guys cut me down a week or whatever to a week, and that means I don't have it on Friday morning so i've got to get up and go to the pharmacy and get it just to feel right. there's no longer than a day, but I mean. I don't know. But like I said I take that it's a good idea. I think i'm on a good track other than. messing with the phone with family conquer it i'm going to do it. making appointments putting them on my calendar i'm going to do it back to put a big old sticker on my door, I will. But i'm not doing this, no more. No, I don't."
105.0,Provider,"So, in your room you don't have a list of to do list of things to do, every day."
1136.0,Patient,"No, I don't have to do this at all. Whatever I mean not whatever, but not a special to do things you know that's why it's kind of boring but um. that's it i'm happy with a boring life right now. That boring."
105.0,Provider,"How do you remember, and this might seem really fundamental, but how do you remember, to take a shower or a bath."
1136.0,Patient,"i've been doing that all my life. see our bath like doesn't that all my life, I never brush your teeth, how do you remember, I know, but we're going to try and use what you already know her I brush my teeth I shave. reflect these shave I already have my clothes in the bathroom address. that's it i've done that all my life in prison, I did it every single day. You forget that."
105.0,Provider,You do it in the morning in the evening.
1136.0,Patient,"morning and evening, sometimes."

105.0,Provider,"Okay, so those things actually aren't you don't need help with those those you already do those are ones that you need a list for what you need help with are things that."
1136.0,Patient,"are always like a week later. Like more in the future, like. That right."
105.0,Provider,"For example, let's say you had to do three things in your room before you left the room before you go take a shower. What are three things you can do that you would feel good about yourself or your brother would be proud of you i've got. i've got make bed, I want you to give me two more that you could post. So, think about your room and you may have to walk in there, what could you do to make sure it's done before you even walk."
1136.0,Patient,out we go look make sure the desk don't look cluttered.
105.0,Provider,"So what should I write what could I write. That you would read and know what to do, is it clean room. That do it."
1136.0,Patient,Clean room and death.
105.0,Provider,"Ah, we go give me something."
1136.0,Patient,"out my bike in there, I mean it's just not easy to well, I guess, I could work in there, but. But a bike we have a compressor the Plaza table compressor."
105.0,Provider,"What you're doing is we're writing a list that you need to remember how about. yeah check now here's where it comes organization, it could be check my phone for appointments check my calendar for appointments, where do you go if you were to be independent. and check for appointments the next day, where or that day Where would you go where would you look for your appointments if you weren't relying on your brother Where would you go to find if you have an appointment."
1136.0,Patient,"My calendar. i've had it for like three months, two months I haven't written on it, but maybe once."
105.0,Provider,"So right in front of you copy these three things you don't have to wonder how to spell them they're already written out this is make it big enough like. James make it big so that it's only three things here so that you're going to post that by the door you're going to check these things before you head out to take a shower. you're going to make bed you're going to clean room and check calendar now you're going to know what check calendar is right, that means do I have an appointment. Yes. I can make that account. Make bed without that miss your first one."
1136.0,Patient,That she'd be any.
105.0,Provider,room and desk right.
1136.0,Patient,My calendar. Okay.
105.0,Provider,"May I see your note. that's nice that's really nice. So. yeah that's Nice. cool so let's get some tape on the back of it or somewhere, so what i'd like you to do is I want it posted somewhere that you're going to promise to do those things before you walk out of your bedroom."
1136.0,Patient,that's a hard one.
105.0,Provider,I know what.
1136.0,Patient,"i'm gonna do it, I know it's gonna be real good your your great women, I always thought that I want you to think that I ever did in doubt you I just missed them because. My. memory."
105.0,Provider,I know that's why we're doing these notes.
1136.0,Patient,"we're doing good we're talking about back in the day when I was growing up. My brothers was good, and then we stopped."
105.0,Provider,"And we know but. yeah that list just now, I want you to do you leave me here take their butts out go into your room and I want you to put the doors here watch. If it's off to the right, will you see it and make yourself do those three things before you leave in the morning because watch just listen just listen. it's not a commitment to me it's to you if it turns out that cleaning the room isn't just as important as your thought, then that will fade and you won't care, but if it is your brother might say things like you're really keeping your room organized and the beds May. And let me keep talking and you remembered your appointment. So you might get natural praise and applause pat on the back from your brother and you. You might like it in yourself and your confidence may go up and all it took was posting those things on the wall, but watch it's not enough that they sit there you have to parent you and make sure you don't leave the room until you do it. If you start ignoring the poster it won't be worth anything, but if you say real quick so watch what you do this look look."
1136.0,Patient,look good even organize my shoes.
105.0,Provider,"That well that's clean room so watch watch what I do watch me I hit the door I look, and I see it, and then I go I look I see my bed I go make it then I start to leave again, I see this sign. In my room okay oh."
1136.0,Patient,"Look, the shoes and socks because. Dirty I don't think that's dirty at all they're just stuff all not all over but i'm I guess the things. That traffic is going away."
105.0,Provider,So listen.
1136.0,Patient,ready cream what I got organize it.
105.0,Provider,"So listen watch just watch me. Watch me all the way through. I start to leave to go take my shower and go have breakfast and a coffee and I stopped. Because I see make bed I go make my bed, then I go back to the door, and then I go oh shoot I need to clean well what clean oh yeah there's dirty laundry. Oh yeah OK so i'll go do that and there's some glue that's open and starting to dry out well i'm going to put that away where it needs to go. And then I had to the door again keep keep listening head to the door, and I look at the list again and it says check calendar and I go okay oh my gosh it's a new day what if I. Wait what, if I have something to do today where's my calendar and go to the calendar hopefully it's in your room."
1136.0,Patient,"My notes up right bye bye calendar if I put it up, I won't miss this one. can be right by my calendar right below it with other panelists dorando that's, the first thing you look at."
105.0,Provider,"So if you telling me that the third thing on that list is check the calendar for appointments by the time you walk out of your room your bed is made. it's you have your laundry ready to go, because you know she was organized maybe the desk is organized and now you've checked your calendar you walk out you see your brother, you might say, you know what I have an appointment today help me remember or you know."
1136.0,Patient,"Like all the a couple of days were just like. Get basket and to make sure I knew, so I kind of know about disappointment, the whole way."
105.0,Provider,"So what I want you to do is I want you to you're going to stand up leave me here go into your room and post that note I level when you're standing to the side of the door, so that you can see it whenever you're about to walk out the door. Okay i'll leave me here and go post it."
1136.0,Patient,"All right, i'll be right back."
105.0,Provider,"So James what you're going to learn. I don't know what it's going to be, but you're going to learn about you you're going to learn oh I didn't put it in the right place, but you might learn this really works or you might learn I only get it."
1136.0,Patient,I already feel it working.
105.0,Provider,Okay.
1136.0,Patient,And what's going to be a success.
105.0,Provider,"will see you might learn it only works once and you only get the bed name and then you forget to look again we'll find out what you will learn. And then you tell me about it and will change what we're doing so that it works better Okay, not a good bad right wrong, we want this to be in the service of your success. Being able to because, ultimately, this is going to be you feeling more confident and proud of yourself over time, more independence and you will feel Oh, I can do things the same way."
1136.0,Patient,up there up it won't be that bad.
105.0,Provider,It will become automatic the same way showering brushing teeth is. Right.

105.0,Provider,"Okay, so now you have a note that your eyes will go and, but you have to keep a commitment to you."
1136.0,Patient,If you want to get better children to do it.
105.0,Provider,"The commitment to you, James is when you see check calendar, you have to take your hands and open it and look, no matter what look, but do you know where to look in the end that Fuck Do you know where to go."
1136.0,Patient,yeah the calendar.
105.0,Provider,Okay.
1136.0,Patient,"Because there have been times when I was lazy. my brother would do it for me, so I never even looked at the calendar, and I was originally put it up there."
