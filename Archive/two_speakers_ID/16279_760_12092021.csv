And I had been been taking care of her, I actually been taking care of her the last. Four or five years of her life and the year in roughly a year before she died I lead, with more than that, like a year year and a half my mother died. Okay, and in some ways, between my mom and my dad. My dad has always backed me and stuff, but in some ways, my mom was the one that tried to get me to open up."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, it."
16279.0,Patient,Was it.
760.0,Provider,"So your mother was a big support for you. Yes, okay."

760.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16279.0,Patient,"They did it get divorced, when I was around 10 or so. And I think part of it is she she did have a drinking problem at a time. Then, your mother yeah."
760.0,Provider,yeah but.
16279.0,Patient,"Part of that is the way my mom my mom was more vocal about our emotions so you're up with a dad where were you pretty much it we started arguing, and we got vocal you you kept on going out until the until you dealt with it. Okay, and then, once it was dealt with you read it so. Appealing have you decided to walk away from their argument. You were saying you were done with it, and he didn't really go back to it when my dad was a bit was more of a quieter person. So I think that was the."
760.0,Provider,"end he would hold his emotions inside, perhaps."
16279.0,Patient,"yeah at least a little bit more than my mom would, so I think that caught some that wasn't, the only thing I don't think that was the only things going on, but I think that kind of. made it harder for them to communicate."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, and how do you think how do you think that affected you like this kind of dynamic watching that as as a little boy."
16279.0,Patient,It probably made me a. bit more closed in I was always bit more of an introvert.
760.0,Provider,Okay.

16279.0,Patient,"yeah that's legit technically my sister was actually my cousin she was my mom's sister's daughter. Okay, but my aunt had drug problems, so my parents ended up adopting her. Okay, when we really understood We grew up as as probably by the time they got adopted as no more than two. months, this is about it. Two years older so she was probably no more than four so but at segment already living with us, I think."
760.0,Provider,Okay.

Okay, but she didn't get that until she was already an adult and it happened after a certain point, after she had my nephew."
760.0,Provider,Okay.
16279.0,Patient,"So, as they think they think it was probably about probably this so she was probably like around 20. or 20 maybe 19 I think she might have been 19 when she added my nephew. No older than 20 years so some of those things. I think were some stuff that would someone mental problems so showing up about the same time, but I think queen her pregnancy and that it kind of exploded. Okay. And I know my sisters had problems with a with a drug addiction and then for so. Long the lines of like self medication doesn't. Because, since you did to their diagnosis till after she was 18 they there wasn't much they wish anybody could do."

760.0,Provider,Okay.
16279.0,Patient,And I started to notice notice that that I was trying to try to shut down and realizing oh. I must be I must be feeling.
760.0,Provider,That you're not. you're not really aware of your depression to sometimes it just kind of creeps on you and you're not really aware it's happening until it gets really big.
16279.0,Patient,"Is that what i'm trying to. I kind of less like like I said it. I had a tendency of shutting down like my mom sometimes she did when I got in my so when a human adult sure she tried to get me out of my Shell by pushing my buttons a bit and I cared about was even if I said I don't want to talk about it should accept that. And she back off it wasn't like she was trying to get me angry she wanted me to respond, even though it says, I don't want to talk about it, she wanted me. And she didn't want me just not just not certain, but hell or something. Talk to her, even if it says shut up."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, see maybe maybe you have a tendency when you're feeling down and isolate yourself and. You lock your feelings away do. You hold your emotions inside and maybe go to your room or go to some close yourself off. and isolated place."
16279.0,Patient,"yeah and i'm not always good with confrontation. And my mom was someone that's come to a competition it's. Like it's not that she wants to be confrontational with everybody, but it's like you know with her it's like if there's a problem we deal with it okay. In it. purple was actually the other side of side it's like I actually. don't see she at one point she actually had to build the habit of walking around her car, she would be where, if you if you knew, she was walking around her car you just left her alone, but the only person that ever gotten that far was her sister. It is cannot stand her sister. so that you know, there was problems between them and that's only time you ever walked around the car and you pretty much knew someone was dying just to leave her alone just you don't want to do, you need to call. It like she needs her space."
760.0,Provider,yeah.
16279.0,Patient,"Okay, yes likes one way or another someone's dying okay. But at that time my dad was also taking care of my nephew my mom was trying to make sure my nephew is being taken care of well so she wasn't more context with my aunt and she wanted to be. Okay that's."
760.0,Provider,yeah okay so have you ever had any thoughts of wanting to hurt yourself or others.
16279.0,Patient,"No my problem is, I just want to shut it i've noticed when I get. I never wanted to hurt myself, but if. The ones where I just want to call it a day in the covers of bed, and not even. exist, sometimes. not die I just don't want to face I don't want to be anywhere near the world."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, you just want to close yourself off from the world. yeah okay all right."
16279.0,Patient,that's the worst that I. want to get bad that's I know i've tried to keep become aware that. When it happens.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, and can, can you tell me about any childhood abuse could be neglect to be verbal emotional abuse physical abuse, sexual abuse, anything like that happened to you either inside the home or outside the one when you were. growing up."

16279.0,Patient,"And it's In it I seen in essence and careful about for the next couple days after the movie that I definitely don't even look at so. i'm pretty then it then it then I don't, then the urges after two or three days that any urge is gone that's good it's easier after there too. Okay, so I, but it still try to let myself have that little tree, but I talked to make sure I know I plan ahead. Okay, I know if i'm going to go to a movie I stay away from the sodas until I go to that movies. Okay, you know."
760.0,Provider,"cuz, this is one of the things that you that you. used to. Just showing them yeah."
16279.0,Patient,"And I found it. And I still like it, but it's like that that that balance thing movies, yes, no other time, otherwise it's just best not to get near. Beyond work. I work in a place that serves, so I know. So I just got what work. The last thing I had that wasn't water was an orange juice. necessarily the best thing for diabetic but it's. it's one of those things where I don't crave orange juice as much as I crave to soda.

Okay, because this is communicated. Okay, I that's one thing I know she know, I have a problem with is. Getting overwhelmed and then shutting down.

But I want to be able to do that more for myself. it's because of the fact that someone else. The color fact that the other person might not realize that it's happening until it's already. started. Okay, before we actually you know it's not as well. So I want. I want to be able to. have an easier time doing it on my own."
