I would get on these tracks of my thinking, and so I took the time to make something pretty and I put it on the board, where I study and I just would read over the board before i'd start studying. And I used to teach smoking cessation on stop smoking classes for the American lung association. And one of the activities that I would do with the. Members of the class, and this is what they taught us to do teach your patients to say I am smoke free, even when they're smoking. So here they are smoking and they're supposed to say 10 times. I am smoke free because the brain actually will produce that yet and say okay i'm smoke free you know the brain can be tricked very easily yeah yeah no good luck with that I think you're onto something."
