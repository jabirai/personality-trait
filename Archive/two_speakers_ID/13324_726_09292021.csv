If everything goes through probably shouldn't be too long, then i'll be able to have something to work with my goal is to get a place for myself and my daughter. So that we can yeah things will go good. Then kind of like patiently waiting for a long time. So it's been kind of Nice finally coming through. yeah. Hopefully, the other party won't cause trouble. They tend to do that a lot so let's see. What do you call it man up. which I don't I don't see it happening, but."
726.0,Provider,yeah.
13324.0,Patient,Give him a chance and see what i'll do. i'm sorry what.
726.0,Provider,Sorry go ahead.
13324.0,Patient,"No nothing. The sands been like a long process so it's been it's Nice that it's finally starting to. to happen. i've been pretty patient. went through a lot of stuff in between. Just kind of tired is like. it's wearing emotionally wearing on me. around like trying to like look at the good that happened because of it, so."
726.0,Provider,How have you been feeling the past two weeks.
13324.0,Patient,"i'm a bit too and all right um. I don't know I mean like where Am I right now i'm just it's a nice place it's quiet. it's good. I just trying to find things to do so, I don't get too bored you know, and I don't even like that word in my vocabulary. And there's always. something you can find a do. board is kind of a very good word, I think, to put in."
726.0,Provider,yeah.
13324.0,Patient,"But I just I just wish my daughter would be my older daughter, would be a little more understanding she's. I don't know. She has her sister she's living there weather."
726.0,Provider,and
13324.0,Patient,she thinks that she's kind of like the one in charge of everything but truth is i'm the parent and and I can decide what what is better best for.
726.0,Provider,them yeah.
13324.0,Patient,"She doesn't quite understand that she's not really being understanding. it's been hard, because you know i've been i've been staying in another place just until i'm able to get this stuff going and. I don't know she doesn't really get it, you know I. Will she told me well, I don't want to live with you anymore, because the for our plan was to get a place together and. To help both her and myself and my other daughter, but now I don't want to live with you anymore, because the people that come on my house they swear they drink like well I don't want her to live with you because of that, you know. wander around that. yeah it doesn't make any sense to me but i'm trying not to fight with her, you know."
726.0,Provider,Have you talked to your younger daughter that's living with her and asking her what she wants she wants to back with you.
13324.0,Patient,"Well that's the thing i've been kind of like kept out of that situation, not being able to talk to her. But I was able to talk to her last couple weeks, which is good that made me feel good. And so I don't know I mean she. I haven't been able to talk to her, but before she didn't really like living with me, because the situation wasn't so good. It wasn't that it was an ideal because. there. It was just us down in southern California and there wasn't any family or support or anything."
726.0,Provider,And yeah.
13324.0,Patient,"And then she was in the House and I was out working you know she's all worried about getting coven there's a lot of stuff going on. And so I don't know, and this, I have a male and really sit down and talk to her very much since all that happened so maybe that would be a good thing to do."
726.0,Provider,yeah it's your older daughter keeping you. She not letting her sister talk to you is that the situation they are.
13324.0,Patient,"Like God she's calling keeping. me from from what i'm supposed to be doing or what I feel like i'm supposed to be doing. I mean, she is doing better though she's going to school she's been doing her assignments she's making friends that are at the high school and yeah so I mean there's a lot of good things happening. But that is just a little frustrating i'm awkward I guess. Well i'm starting to be helped feel healthier and i've been keeping up with all the things i'm supposed to do, which was quite a bit because I got my diabetes so tickled by meet immense. Make sure I keep my blood sugar good. And then i've been taking care of my mental health stuff."
726.0,Provider,And yeah.
13324.0,Patient,"And all those meds and then. yeah even have to have I injections last week and I didn't feel too good like. my eyes are bleeding in the back my eyes and they're swollen and they're trying to help them so they don't get worse. So I got some issues there with my. With my eyes so. i'm not saying to complain i'm just saying it's just what it is. I gotta deal with a lot of stuff. yeah it's been good so. i've been able to focus on all kinds of things. But I don't know like I said, unlike to be. I guess more involved. And I was you know, I was in the process of trying to get a house. So that. It would be good for for all of us. And I guess to have her tell me that it kind of her. that she. wanted to. Oh i'm sorry go ahead."
726.0,Provider,"No, I was just wondering like what she has said to you like in what way did she say it when you met with her."
13324.0,Patient,"She has said that she didn't want to she don't want to live with me. And you know I don't know I guess it's Okay, because that's you know her choice she's old enough to figure all that out. But. For her to say that's like kind of pushing me out of. push me pushing me out of her life around the life of her sister to which is not cool. yeah and well, a lot of her problem is is that i'm religious and I go to church and she doesn't agree with all that she doesn't she has her own beliefs or own which I I respect that I don't. Cross those lines, I don't say Oh, you have to go to church and you have to do this now I just do what I want to do, I go to church and I, you know do. What I do. That I feel a little persecuted. For for believing something you know. And I don't see ya."
726.0,Provider,yeah.
13324.0,Patient,"I mean I don't I don't know how you see it, but I don't see that as being fair. Because I don't do that to her, I mean, even though she's got a lot of different beliefs, that I don't agree with that I don't talk about them too much to her, because I want to like offender you know. yeah but she seems to not look at why so heather even like it doesn't matter to her. She just says, whatever she wants to say and that's it. So anyway, I just brought it up, because it was something that's been weighing on my mind I guess."
726.0,Provider,"yeah Of course I can. It might be worth having a conversation with her about how you're feeling, because you know if she was. You know she's been helping you, with your other daughter and that's her sister at the end of the day, you really are the mother and so you know you do have the right to you know."
13324.0,Patient,It will.
726.0,Provider,"Say yeah. Or at least, or at least for her to explain in a way that you can understand why she thinks that but, at the end of the day, you really have the rights for your child's not her."
13324.0,Patient,"Right right, and then I feel in a way, I feel like she's kind of crossing over those boundaries. And I don't really want to get an apply, whether you know, have a misunderstanding which I feel like it's kind of going to that point where i'm going to have to like say something and I don't really like it, you know, like up having to do that. she's like well you just don't respect me. Well, I don't agree with what she's doing, I mean that doesn't mean I don't respect her it's just my. I just have my points of view, just like she has points of view. So I don't know I guess we'll work it out somehow."
726.0,Provider,"I be thought of maybe you know, once you do get your own place maybe doing some kind of of family therapy with your daughter just you guys can discuss everything that's happened um cuz i'm sure there's gonna be a lot that's going to come out and now what's your."
13324.0,Patient,"there's a lot of things that that went on that was good, I mean like with her dad it was not a good situation. And it would be beneficial for both of us, but mostly I mean a lot for her because she kind of just closed up and was just angry all the time at me."
726.0,Provider,For what happened here.
13324.0,Patient,"And I didn't really have much choice because she was getting more. abusive and more dangerous to be around so. something about it, you know. And it's not like I wanted to, but I had to otherwise I don't know where i'd be right now I probably wouldn't be here. yeah he just had a lot of issues and he still. kind of has a lot of issues might not want to deal with them so. She was put on the restraining order as well, so she wasn't able to she hasn't been able to see him since. That happened in April 2020 so it's been a while. But now that we're we've been going back to court for mediation. She says that she wants to at least talk to on the food she doesn't want to see him, but she wants to talk to him on the phone. So i'm just hoping that. It won't cause more more problems for her. Because he can be quite mean employed. yeah. is pretty cruel sometimes she has a I mean I don't know I don't like even known to talk about this, but she decided that she wants to be transgender."
726.0,Provider,Like 14 year.
13324.0,Patient,So I mean it does bother me because I mean I. I don't really understand it all. You know my kids are believing that this is something they want to do. But um I guess i'm just it's kind of new to me and i've been trying to like. understand it.
726.0,Provider,yeah.
13324.0,Patient,"I think, with with her mainly is just. it's not like she wants to be a boy or something like that she just maybe it's just something cool or something they want to do now, it is. She wants to be gender neutral like whatever that means."
726.0,Provider,"yeah. She doesn't want identify as. male or female, but just as a person."
13324.0,Patient,"Just as a percentage which I can understand you know. But it's new to me and I don't quite understand why someone would feel that way, but I i'm still trying to get. get to that point but her sisters like really pushing it it's like almost pushing her towards that. it's like Oh, you want to be my brother now you know it's really weird. So I just I don't. That for another reason I don't want her to be around her sister so much because she's not really understanding the gravity of the situation. So I don't know that's another thing that's been hard for me to deal with."
726.0,Provider,"yeah well that I mean it sounds like there's a lot of stuff going on with your daughter fits everything that happened when you were all living together and then also the that about on wanting to be gender neutral and or transgender he said. um it's not sounds like I mean it sounds like she's at that age where. it's pretty common for for teenagers to. become experimental and really understand their sexuality and what that means for them. yeah so, so I think that may be, you know. i'm as a mother, you know. You I feel like you'll know what you want to do with that um. Well, how do you feel about. How do you feel about that and Is this something new that came out after. She moved in with her sister."
13324.0,Patient,"No, it was before that. yeah I don't know I mean I just i'm not sure exactly what caused her feel that way or. I think. That her dad I don't know something with her dad i'm not sure what happened but CEOs I was gone for a while, because I had to get away from me, he was being very abusive. And she wouldn't go with me so she decided to stay with them and I don't know he just did a lot of weird stuff you know, like. And he was like I don't know how to explain it, but he he at one point in locker clause locker room so she was locked in a room for a long time. bring her to work and have her sleep in the car, so I wouldn't be able to take care of them are just really wasn't very good. away from me and. I don't know he just kind of like ruined our relationship which wasn't cool. Because we're really close for since she was a baby, all the way up until maybe about 10 or 11 is, when all this started happening so. So that wasn't good and then she's upset because I wasn't there when you know when she had her period and all that stuff. And I. And that was about the same time, so he was just like being a jerk and not letting me be there for her. and"
726.0,Provider,nj know that.
13324.0,Patient,"I told her because she told me well mom you weren't here that, during that time i'm sorry I was a solar i'm sorry it wasn't there, but he kept me from you, which is true. And yeah he wasn't truthful I don't know I mean what he did, to me, makes me think that she shouldn't be around him because. yeah he he was. forcing me to have sex, well then, what I told him no and he still did like two nights in a row, and then, then he continued to be on that same path, but you know it's like I told him no and he didn't. want to listen, but I had problems with other things before that that was just the last few last things that happened that made me completely say no way you're not doing this anymore. But i'm not sure what happened when I was gone and which something could happen, I don't really know for sure, but i'm not gonna wait around and find out later."
726.0,Provider,yeah I.
13324.0,Patient,"did something to her, because I mean if he's gonna do it to me and i'm an adult but let's again due to her, you know. i'm hoping hoping not but. I mean, because, like, I told her. Whenever one of her cousins well it's not really because it's like a step cousin well anyway, he was being molested when he was like from 11 to 18. By like a like a stepbrother well anyway, I just said that all so yeah I will he became homosexual because he was being molested and he thought he was gay or whatever, and she got really mad at me and. i'm just like Why would she gets mad at me for me to think the fact the truth. When she just she flipped out and she got mad at me it's like okay well hopefully that didn't happen to her, you know. But. what's a."
726.0,Provider,"way to go, racing."
13324.0,Patient,"or just saying I mean, I hope that didn't happen to her, I mean I don't really know for sure. All I know is that he had a lot of issues and. You know I just don't want to deal with it anymore. And I don't want her to have to deal with it."
726.0,Provider,yeah.
13324.0,Patient,"So I think it's good to keep her safe, you know away from that situation. The fact that she wants to talk to them is kind of big step for her. Because he was pretty mean to or mistreated or so."
726.0,Provider,yeah I.
13324.0,Patient,"mean Why would you lock your daughter, and in a room. and keep her away from her mother when i'm able to take care of her and. Just because he's selfish you know it's like. yeah it was a whole bad situation."
726.0,Provider,Like he had a lot of. Problems or. Some substantive.
13324.0,Patient,"Definitely nice to have substance abuse, but he has mental issues. That he's not willing to. accept. me. he's got a lot of problems. He when he when he's at work he doesn't really get along with the people were means like thanks thing somebody's gonna hurt him or they're out there. Like one time, he was working with so I thought they were going to kill them. And another time he's at work and. he's working graveyard and he's really where he's like seeing seeing ghost or something else, like. strange. i'm just i'm listening to them, but i'm not you know i'm not making fun of them, I think. that's pretty strange, I know I don't know I mean all know how to deal with him, he just he does have mental issues that he's never faced or he's never. he's quick to judge anybody that has problems like. Oh yeah they get this problem Okay, they get this problem but he's not look ever looking at himself that Oh, I have that same problem. So I don't know I mean I I am I, at least on i'm willing to admit I do have mental problems, I do have things that I want to work on. And yeah and I do, I take my meds and I actually am doing really good with what i've been taken. And I don't know I don't. i'm not saying i'm perfect, but at least i'm. taking care of the issues i'm not like denying them, which I could do. it'd be nice to say no, I don't have any problems that I like. But I do have mental issues, and I do take care of them so."
726.0,Provider,"That sounds like therapy would be really beneficial for you and your daughter, though, because even even if you weren't to move into your own place and. Maybe you know, maybe your daughter didn't move in with you just yet, at least, you could hash out and kind of communicate with each other what's going on, or each other's perspective because a lot of times like. You know, sometimes we assume something or we think something, but until your daughter tells you. Her side you're not going to fully know everything right so. You know even even any curious about you know if she does. If she is talking about my sexuality like how. How can. You know, ask her to help you understand it better, so that you know what she what's going on with her to. Because, maybe, maybe your older daughter is assuming that you're gonna shut down because of that, like who knows what she thinks right."
13324.0,Patient,"yeah I don't know I mean she's she's actually good our own issues, so I don't you know that's why I haven't really pushed anything too much because she's dealing with her own issues i'm she's I mean, I guess, this is. divulging something, but she she just went to. went into a facility, because she did have some mental issues."
726.0,Provider,yeah.
13324.0,Patient,"And that she is recovering from all out and she's been taking her meds and she just she got pushed her to self to par to do things. And no kind of like. More than she should maybe it's just because she she thinks that's the way to make herself look better feel better is to do more. She doesn't need to you know you know. Talking about overachiever. yeah trying to do more. To make yourself feel better, but she doesn't really have to do more, she just has to be yourself and that's good enough. And so. I guess it's just going to go up quite a bit to kind of repair some of the damages there."
726.0,Provider,yeah.
13324.0,Patient,"I guess she's kind of like. I don't know, maybe she's upset with me because I had chosen. way back when when she was a teenager. She was causing a lot of problems with the House, and so I chose to try and work things out. With the dad you know the step God. yeah and I didn't show choose her side, but there was a lot of us, I mean it wasn't just mean. dad and. sister, there was the two brothers to I mean there was like there was a lot of us living at the House. So that's why I chose to follow. You know, to keep peace in the House and. I didn't choose her side, which you know I can I do feel bad, which would have been better for her if I did. But it's just what I did so she feels like I I shafted her which I didn't really mean to."
726.0,Provider,Do yeah.
13324.0,Patient,"I just had to do to keep peace in the House, I mean a lot of. There was a lot of us, there was the four kids and then myself and my husband, so I know I don't know I just did what I had to at that time so."
726.0,Provider,"Maybe that's something maybe that's something that she might want to know, though, because you know if she's not talking to you she's only remembering. from her perspective, something that happened, you know, and so you know, at least if you can talk to her, you know your I think it will. Whatever the issues are that are happening that are keeping you both apart, maybe the stuff that's the really nice view or you can repair that relationship that you have with each other."
13324.0,Patient,"yeah we were doing actually we're starting to do pretty good about repairing it and then my older sister. got involved, and she started talking to my daughter ellie she's the oldest one and then she got really angry at me my rate and. Ever since then change this life she doesn't want anything to do with me it's really bad I mean I don't. I don't know what my sister told her, she shouldn't have actually not gotten involved in the middle of it, so it wasn't not our business but. yeah boy I think which told her is that I was talking about about her to my my younger sister but that's the problem my older sister my younger sister ever since right before my dad passed they've been in the goal fight and they still are continuing. i'm. Its kind of bad because I don't wanna I don't want any fighting I don't want to deal with it because it's just not it's stupid, I mean you're adults come on grow up and stop. That but for her to say something to ellie my older daughter, and say that i'm not being loyal or something like that to her and i'm talking about about her with the younger sister. That wasn't good."
726.0,Provider,"So you haven't talked to your oldest daughter says, sir."
13324.0,Patient,"Oh i've been talking to her, but she's it's almost like she doesn't want to talk to me, she seems like distant."
726.0,Provider,To ask her.
13324.0,Patient,"But before. It wasn't like that, before we're actually starting to get along good and she was helping me a lot, she was she was mad at me a lot, because I wouldn't do exactly what she told. me to do yeah but you know. Just to realize i'm an adult I mean and then also diabetes is nice thing to do it it's not like you're always going to have a perfect number. And it's going to be and me, since i've had for a long time it's not going to react badly, even if you eat good and everything like that sometimes your body decides it wants to. Have a high blood sugar just for no reason at all, and anyway, she she would get mad at me and on a mother's day she went ballistic because my blood sugar is really high and she drove me to mercy and scared. She I think she ran about five stops stops. And i'm just like le you know it's like i'm gonna have a hard stop. It was planet crazy I nursing her like that, before. But I was kind of naughty that day, because the day goes to treat at church and I did eat it so. My blood sugar. And I wasn't able to control blood sugar, it can get pretty high sometimes. So i've been trying to be better."
726.0,Provider,yeah. It sounds like there's a lot of issues with your relationship with your kids.
13324.0,Patient,"yeah I seem like my my girls I don't get along as good as my boys, I do actually they. I get along better with the boys than they do the girls I don't know what it is, I guess, I gotta learn how to get along with girls better than voice sometimes. I just don't I don't know so I was."
726.0,Provider,yeah.
13324.0,Patient,"Maybe I need to work on it, something I need to work on so."
726.0,Provider,"let's say just enhance your communication with them, because I think boys not always because it's kind of stereotype that think that guys just don't talk as much, but I think sometimes. It actually honestly doesn't matter what, gender, you are, but I think some people need more communication than others, some people want a need. Clear communication, so if you're if you feel like there's an issue going on with or you're feeling like they feel differently about you. it's just it's it makes more sense to just be direct, even if you think it's going to cause an issue, because what ends up happening is it gets brushed under the rug and then. All of a sudden it's been three years and it'll talk to somebody and you don't even know why, because it was never talked about, and at that point, time has gone by and maybe things have been forgotten. On so just just try to be really, really direct with. You know, with your kids like if you're struggling, you can say that you can say listen i'm struggling i'm having a really hard time I didn't do this on purpose it was a really difficult time, and you know see what happens from there. But I would try it even if it's just your own whether it's your oldest daughter your youngest daughter um start start the conversation because i'm sure they want to know. um things that maybe they're too scared to ask, maybe they're they're not sure whether they want to say anything you know."
13324.0,Patient,"yeah. yeah I think you're right. slow. I guess it's something I just need to work on it's. it's it's not like an easy thing for me to do sometimes. I don't know. Things event, how many easy. Because things were good before before it married there step dad us. I mean I don't know he seemed Okay, but. That really he's he wasn't really what he seemed. wasn't very honest with me about a lot of things so. Well it's good that it's finally getting resolved some some things are going to resolve. So I don't know i'm just going to keep working on it. But I think you're right, I do need to talk to both my. Both orders."
726.0,Provider,"I mean if it's, especially if they're your kids it's your family so sometimes the hard conversations, are the ones worth having the most because. You just never know I mean never know what's gonna happen in life, you never know you know who's gonna move away who's gonna stay close by you just don't know it in you know even sometimes I think by keeping the peace, sometimes we don't always. not always clear out the things that need to be cleared out, especially with family, and you know it sounds like you really care about your kids and you. want a relationship you want your daughter to live with you, and maybe they're having you know some fears about it but it's worth just having a conversation so at least you know where they're coming from. or they can understand you."
13324.0,Patient,"yeah like you said talk about it at least. Because I mean I think they do have their own his own issues. and I don't know. I think talking to him, and probably a good thing to do."
726.0,Provider,"keep an open mind to. because sometimes. We we think we know what they're feeling or thinking back in the day, I want to say tell us rebellion don't know."
13324.0,Patient,You know kind of give them their space to be able to be them. um I guess I grew up kind of learn a different. Situation worms. expected to be a certain way. And so I mean it's hard to like. I guess what how I grew up that has to be different than that. Love I guess it's just a learning learning thing it's like I knew. So anyway just something I need to work on. So anyway i'm just i'm. getting ready to go to a mediation to figure out what to tell.
726.0,Provider,"Our Okay, well, I hope, and I wish you the best of luck at that mediation me."
13324.0,Patient,"yeah I mean I want what's best for them, and just. They seem to be doing better, but I don't like being. The whole picture of it. It doesn't seem right and. Like I mean. I am the. parent and the mother. I only the only reason that I. wasn't really in that situation, because I was in a hospital. yeah and when I got out of the hospital, I still have a lot of recovery do. and And just barely getting where i'm feeling even able to do like work or do something."
726.0,Provider,"yeah well you know what to Jennifer it doesn't have to be black and white, you don't have to be totally cut out of your kid's life or completely in it all the time, even if, even if, for whatever reason, if she is not to move in with you. Then you can have a conversation with your direct like in what way in what capacity will it be good for me to be involved with Maybe you can like. Have mother daughter dates every week that you do something together just the two of you, or maybe it's dropping her off or picking her up from school like. There must be a way where you can be involved in a way that makes that everyone and or, at least for you and your daughter, you can bulk and comfortable with."
13324.0,Patient,yeah well at least start you know. The studies employees.
726.0,Provider,yeah.
13324.0,Patient,I think like you said would be good. At least something.
726.0,Provider,I can tell them that.
13324.0,Patient,"I think that would be a good thing to do, I mean cuz. it's just going to take time, I think, to heal some other ones. Like. For instance. yeah I mean I. I don't know I mean they're on an age words like I remember that age I didn't know like. just want to what. Do I don't really care, I mean I didn't want anything to do with my parents actually sometimes. yeah but it's just it's just the age it's just kind of like you're you're starting to be more independent do what you. What you feel is I don't know kind of like in between age, because she's 14 almost 15. I remember, most of my kids. at that age as teenagers, they were kind of like brats. Even the boy. I get along better with the boys, but. I mean even my younger son. That was his age when he will be in abroad to like kinda like normal it's just part of growing up you've got to get past a certain age. To move on to the next stage. So I don't know like you said, though, I mean that does sound like a good idea. spin like spend time."
726.0,Provider,yeah. Even if it's just like getting an ice cream together don't have to be anything extravagant could just be a simple dance.
13324.0,Patient,"Like well I went over there yesterday and my daughters like well why did you come over it anyone call or anything. Mostly was again you'd never told me this before so it's like. made me feel kind of. Like wait a second what has changed, you know. I don't know. And she didn't see my older sister sums like did you talk to her about something I don't know that I don't know about. I don't know it's strange I just I rather my older sister stay out of it because she's kind of like buddy and mercy shouldn't be. But she's kind of does that with a lot of situations so. I don't know I guess I won't I won't like assume that something happened but. Actually, she does kind of seem different than last. Year both try to try to figure it out."

726.0,Provider,"And the first steps to to repairing a relationship or you know if you're if you're feeling like there's a lot of tension or. Like disagreements within the within any relationship, whether it's friends family or whoever, the only way that they can get resolved is to communicating with each other and if. If you can open that line for them, both in that channel and just be curious about what they're going to say. Because if you're curious, then it leaves space for whatever they're going to tell you, to be able to take that in um. And I mean I know it sounds so simple like okay try not to assume but it's so easy to do when you've had relationships with people for a really long time because you start to know their patterns right. So just be really curious like asked her daughter like what is like what are your thoughts like what are the things that. That are bothering you that maybe we can talk about and try to resolve, I really care about you, I want a relationship you're my family or my daughter. You know, things like that, where you can open up that conversation with her, and I think, maybe you'll see a shift in the relationship dynamics, you know so just be curious to see what happened."
