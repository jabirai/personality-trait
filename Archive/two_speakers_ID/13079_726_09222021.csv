13079.0,Patient,i'm sorry.
726.0,Provider,Is there anybody that referred you to our program specifically.
13079.0,Patient,"I used to be seen at a behavioral clinic here in my town, but it was for more on the high such severe and. So um. yeah I started to get better so they sent me here."
726.0,Provider,"So. i'll just start by just giving some information on my end. I am a therapist here right heart. i'm still a mandated reporter. there's any. If there's any. Like if you're actively if anyone actually that. I talked to is actively suicidal. I need to have a protocol of how we would do with it. or. I don't know, do you have any questions or you're curious about."
13079.0,Patient,The whole abuse thing. What is abuse that happened like six years ago.
726.0,Provider,"With whatever port it unless it was actively still happening. Because I hope it because some people have like really. traumatic events that have happened in the past, and they are, they can talk about it, discuss it. it's only if it's like actively happening currently in your life if you're living with someone, that is the answer. Then. that's different, but you know if there's a claim of like out on the beach or something like that that's happening, they need to report it. And then."
13079.0,Patient,"Okay, that sounds good."
726.0,Provider,yeah so tell me tell me a little bit about yourself like. Some of the. symptoms that are kind of like getting in the way of your quality of life.
13079.0,Patient,"i'm bipolar disorder, for one, I have a lot of manic episodes i'm i'm a very like on 10 person and. yeah I have a really hard time staying focused like really hard time it's so bad that it's almost painful to sit in a conversation with someone and listen to them talk. um. I do have some trauma and I don't know if affects me like I know a lot of people say like. Like I mean I don't have flashbacks or anything. yeah ISA affect me when I was a kid but I don't know yeah it's just mostly the bipolar disorder."
726.0,Provider,What happened to us appeared around to what you just were you when it was happening.
13079.0,Patient,"um. When I was younger like really unlike, for I have a suspicion that I was molested because growing up as a child, a very young child like around the age of five and six, I was having my parties like rabe each other. So. stuff like that, and then I remember around the age of. 11 all the way up to the age of like 15 my mom was physically abusive."
726.0,Provider,Have you ever done in the past.
13079.0,Patient,"Honestly, no."
726.0,Provider,"Like in the future, I don't know how you feel about it now, but."
13079.0,Patient,"yeah i'd want to, because I feel like there's certain things that I do that's because of my trauma and my relationship with my mom like it does affect my current relationships."
726.0,Provider,"You talk to me a little bit about that, like How does that affect your relationships now."
13079.0,Patient,"um I also had bb D, I was also diagnosed with borderline personality disorder. it's really hard keeping a relationship and I tend to find myself in very unhealthy relationships and I tend to kind of stay in relationships, where the love is there and then it's not work kind of like. The rug underneath my feet and I I don't know but I always stay and I have a feeling it's because my mom always loved me like that."
726.0,Provider,"So it sounds like you have some. Pretty. you're pretty to Berlin, where. you're making the connection that that that relationship is now affecting the way they they tell other people. Is that with thought. Is that more with romantic relationships or just relationships in general, my friendships are."
13079.0,Patient,"Honestly, just relationships in general. But it's especially hard with romantic relationships i'm. Like for some reason I think it's the BP D, but it's just like really hard keeping a romantic relationship I tend to like kind of blow up on them and, like you know it's just it's it's really hard."
726.0,Provider,"For me, I have new i'm like in the past for any time recently have you ever had any suicidal."
13079.0,Patient,"um when I was really young I did attempt, when I was like 13 but then. i'm recently back in February I almost did it like I was gonna I had the plan and everything. And I was like about to go, I had a plan to go to the beach and do it so then no one would like know me or find me but I ended up not going."
726.0,Provider,"And so, like everything."
13079.0,Patient,"I had work I didn't I was scared that if I missed it and I went into it, they would fire me, so I was like you know it just kind of I guess it was a reality check."
726.0,Provider,"i'm not going to just ask you some questions that I won when I first meet with them, because this is just to get us a good history and understand that and also you know. Eventually, we do any kind of trauma work that's it's just good to know what what history do have clients, that we can treat you in a way that is responsive to you all right um. This is going, these are more recent questions about how you're feeling, more recently, within the past three months okay if you're if you felt this way. Like cuz you told me February so that's more than three months ago, just let me know okay. Have you wish that you were dead or wish to could go to sleep and not wake up."
13079.0,Patient,A yeah.
726.0,Provider,"Would you say that fan um was that more than three months ago, or just say within the past few months, you felt like that."
13079.0,Patient,was in the past.
726.0,Provider,Have you actually had thoughts of killing yourself.
13079.0,Patient,um. I guess know.
726.0,Provider,"When you say now, can you explain a little bit."
13079.0,Patient,"um it's more like i'll think about it, I got like that's a great idea, but I know on act on it."
726.0,Provider,Have you been thinking about how you might do it like when you have thought of. myself.
13079.0,Patient,"um I have a general like go to plan, but plans kind of always there you know."
726.0,Provider,"And that's the one about the beach. earlier. Are you like, most recently, are you having thoughts about it with with an intention to."
13079.0,Patient,know.
726.0,Provider,Can you tell me. What was. super happy.
13079.0,Patient,"And then just do something I guess like when i'm more serious about it i'd probably think about what exactly I do to cut myself. But because i'm not like serious about it and it's just kind of like a casual thought it's just kind of like something that really stops me is the fact that i'm scared of death and pain oh. i'm like I would obviously death is not a pleasant experience, so I wouldn't as of right now, because i'm not serious, I don't really have a perfect idea what sounds good to do."
726.0,Provider,who supports like emotional support.
13079.0,Patient,um my best friend is. My mom sometimes. yeah.

13079.0,Patient,Since I was 14 but we grew up together we just had a big break in which we didn't see each other.
726.0,Provider,and Tell me. How relationships. With Jesus. Was it there was like some sort of fight or did it just like naturally you guys were the different directions.
13079.0,Patient,"um there we did get into a fight where we didn't see each other for a year, but that big garden see her in my childhood was because my mom's our moms were friends, but they stopped being friends."
726.0,Provider,"So, like right now just tell us the supportive person in your life. You said that you were working or are you still working."

13079.0,Patient,I really like it it's really good.
726.0,Provider,Do you find that you kind of are like getting a better understanding of yourself through the work that you're doing.
13079.0,Patient,"um funny enough, I feel like I try to stay away from the mental illness side of it like i'm I have a psychology and associates in psychology and I never took like a mental illness class. Just because I feel like I have a tendency to have like a self fulfilling prophecy and I don't want to go and influence myself with that."
726.0,Provider,"Like where, if you were to see yourself like let's say it's a three to six months from now, how would you like, how would you like your life to look like or feel like if it doesn't feel like now."

726.0,Provider,satisfied.
13079.0,Patient,"I feel like i'm pretty ungrateful like it's hard for me to. See the things my life and appreciate them. And I, I guess, I want to be happy enough to appreciate the things. I know that make you happy, but you know I want to be able to like. I feel like i'm always stuck in my head and I just kind of want to be like. out here like and appreciate hear."
726.0,Provider,me see that you're stuck in your head a lot is that the way it feels like when you're interacting with other people as.
13079.0,Patient,"yeah it's it's really bad my friends different friends that haven't even spoke to each other, tell me stuff like you know you interrupt us a lot is kind of sounds like you're talking to yourself, instead of having a conversation."
726.0,Provider,"So, are they is it that you're having conversations with yourself, or is it more like you get excited. To respond back."
13079.0,Patient,"it's like they're talking about oh yeah The other day I went to the movies and. I watched this movie and then I go. Oh i've seen this movie like this is my favorite movie and then I started talking about mindfully you know it's not like. Like I try my hardest, not to do it it's not something i'm doing to be obnoxious. it's just I can't focus on what they're saying and. Whatever pops up in my brain just seems more pressing than what they're saying."
726.0,Provider,"yeah. Now holly know when you got diagnosed with the PD. What what was the facility that you want to when you were receiving mental health treatment, but it was like more severe cases over there, that you were talking about the beginning."
13079.0,Patient,"Like the name or what kind of treatment, was it."

726.0,Provider,"When was the last time that you went there for treatment that one did you transition. can see where you were transition here how long was there a time in between, where you are not getting any treatment."
13079.0,Patient,"i'm. In my last couple months there wasn't receiving any therapy services because i'll be honest with you the therapist sucked she was kind of rude and dismiss my feelings a lot, so I stopped going to 34 months before I even left the facility. And I was still receiving medication up until I came here like I still had refills on medication."
726.0,Provider,"Now, do you have any history of substance use like. Would you take anything. Any kind of drug use or anything like that. No, no."
13079.0,Patient,i'm just very rarely like socially and I never go over like one day or two bears I like. i'm not i'm not a huge like alcohol person it's not very fun for me.
726.0,Provider,Now I need you have any medical issues before.
13079.0,Patient,"So I. got diagnosed with an eating disorder there and I have a really hard time eating like it's it's bad it's I used to have an eating disorder, when I was 17 like it was a little bit more like. Okay, so here's the thing I used to starve myself on purpose and I used to do it to lose weight and I was really skinny and I was obsessive over my body, but then I got better. And one excuse me, one day, I just lost my appetite and haven't been able to eat sense but it's not a conscious i'm starving myself, and I want to. lose weight. it's just. My relationship with food is not good."
726.0,Provider,"Words would you say, does it feel to you."
13079.0,Patient,yeah it's really unhealthy I eat I lost like 40 pounds with intense. It was. very rapid.
726.0,Provider,And now.
13079.0,Patient,i'm. Sorry i'm.
726.0,Provider,able to eat now like. i've been able to kind of like take something.
13079.0,Patient,"um I can eat but it's not very much and it's very small meals, like, I can only eat like a whole sandwich I cannot finish all sandwich probably like 50 to 75% of that sandwich."
726.0,Provider,"and wonder is not eating for seven about time like know how they can get sticky notes, of course, start portion sizes it's like if you haven't been eating for. Or if you stopped eating for a while it's hard to eat all at once, like a big portion of maybe the smaller one like maybe smaller portions more throughout the day like might be, I feel better."
13079.0,Patient,"i'm The only thing is, is, I feel physically sick when I more than like Okay, for example, yesterday. My best friend my some she's always showing me to eat. She buys me food and stuff. Like that so she bought me a bacon gouda from starbucks. And I couldn't finish it I. Like half of it. But that made me pretty full up until. i'm like 9pm that night. Night on you. So it was like very little, but it kept me full throughout the day."
726.0,Provider,"So, so they had you diagnosed. I know you said that they would have continued to. prescriptions one did that stop."
13079.0,Patient,As soon as I came here and I got a refill here. Then I was good.
726.0,Provider,So see Charles. Have you have you been able to go to your groups or have you started your groups yeah.
13079.0,Patient,"Okay that's the thing I was supposed to start my groups. I thought I missed the first one. So I went to go reschedule another appointment because I missed two appointments right I missed the group one, and then I missed your appointment. So I went to go reschedule that they gave me a time, so in my head, I thought Okay, this is the reschedule for the group and I had been missing the groups, every week. thinking that I rescheduled that. Instead of. I, and then I realized After talking to someone I realized oh there every week, no appointment needed. No reminder. So I tried going yesterday and by this icon in the form of the groups, so I asked them hey what what time is my group and they told me 11am and I thought Okay, that seems fair, so I go to check in at 10 and they tell me your group was at eight they gave me Eastern time instead so. I tried, I tried putting in the effort but."
726.0,Provider,I missed it because of yours yeah. yeah yeah.
13079.0,Patient,"So i'm honestly i'm. An August, up until a week ago, I was very, very depressed I didn't go to any doctors. Appointments anything. So that's why I missed. appointment with you guys. Okay, something happened and i'm trying to get my shit back together so excuse my language."
726.0,Provider,that's fine.
13079.0,Patient,So i'm trying to put an effort now.
726.0,Provider,"So this is what we want to do paulina so your next group is on the 28th. At 8am Pacific time. So, would you like to meet weekly or every two weeks."
13079.0,Patient,"I can meet with you weekly I honestly. I like seeing the way that I was like a month ago, I think I should be seeing you weekly just because I don't want to fall down that hole again, you know."
726.0,Provider,"And I think also too. I think that, even if we can put it in for the weekly and then see how you're feeling throughout you know throughout that time frame. I think we have there's plenty of things that we could work on. Based on. early morning person afternoon."
13079.0,Patient,"Honestly i'm like the mornings, but i'm pretty because of my job, and then everything going on, so I think it's better if we stick to mornings."

13079.0,Patient,yeah that might that might be better.
726.0,Provider,sorry about that i'm glad you love. There we go. So Pauline. what's your relationship.
13079.0,Patient,"it's pretty it's not like unhealthy or anything but are you a lot they're always trying to kick me out, but I feel like it's just like normal family drama like you didn't clean your room like you're not responsible around the House it's not anything crazy."
726.0,Provider,um you didn't mention your dad is he someone that not actively plan your life or is he somewhere else.
13079.0,Patient,"he's um he is a part of my life, he lives here he's just we're super like distant it's not anything bad or anything we just don't really talk and I see him around the House but he's a very quiet person."
726.0,Provider,"yeah cuz he didn't mention combat awesome. Anything there. For. You so so next week, on Friday, does that sound good to you. I want i'm going to send you. Some information. About it's it's a trauma focus there be and I don't know if that's something that you'd be interested in. In doing for our sessions um it's not me Dr Ivan never heard that before."
13079.0,Patient,"No, I haven't."
726.0,Provider,"So it's it's a trauma therapy on and it's. It has a very long name but i'm going to send you a PDF it's in the describes it and in detail, basically pig you know specific memories to process. And by processing what happens is like you'll have a traumatic event and then out of that one event you'll have five different behaviors that come out of it so like so each behavior they can be unhealthy behaviors but they're just it's all rooted from one place. And sometimes people have many traumatic events so it's not just like one every fixes everything. But the beginning of us working together it's religious building coping skills me understanding, you and your history of your past because you don't always get that one session takes time to really get to know like where the person that and. The things that have happened to them so i'm going to send this information to you and just kind of say vertical again and see if it's something you'd be interested in doing in our sessions here. We wouldn't start right away doing you know trauma work because it's very heavy. So it's really just building relationship and trust first and then then if it's something that you want to do that. We can go in that direction."
13079.0,Patient,"Okay, that sounds good."
726.0,Provider,"Okay, so I will send you an email just a couple minutes. And we have something set up, so your next, for it is on the 28th. I will see you on our next session."
13079.0,Patient,"Okay um, can I just say one thing really quick. Something I really stopped me from trusting my last therapist and having good sessions was the fact that she was always saying that I was doing well. Like she was always telling me you're doing while you're doing better than my other clients you don't need this level of care and it really felt like it really didn't make me want to go to therapy, not only did it make me feel like i'm. Like what's the point of going to therapy if i'm doing so well but also felt dismissing the wrong of pain, I was in at the moment, so I just. I don't know like I guess that's like a trigger for me, so I just wanted to set that up now like I would you I know you might have good intentions, if you're telling me, it sounds like you're doing well, but you know. I would like to focus at the problem at hand is how i'm appear to be doing, you know."
726.0,Provider,"If you're following me, you know when you've said that some stuff happened, and then you in that last one, and how you feel like you need to get everything together. Can you tell me a little bit about what was happening, maybe like a month ago that like led you to this place of like feeling really motivated to take care of your mental power."
13079.0,Patient,"Well, made me feel motivated. i'm a week ago my cat almost died because I had advil my room was discussing I was so depressed on my room was like a mess. And the advil was on the floor, and she ate it and almost died my cats mean everything to me, so I realized like my destructive behavior wasn't only affecting me it was affecting the thing I love the most. And so I realized if I wanted to keep my cats in my life like I couldn't keep living like this."
726.0,Provider,"It so that makes a lot of sense yeah. Our cats Okay, how many cuts to have."
13079.0,Patient,"I have to have my own and then what am I long's that's why I keep going because they're getting rowdy right now. Like my cousin. Like me, and stuff. So that's."
726.0,Provider,"You know, one of the nice things to be on like this, is that you can have your cats with you like that's not a problem at all, so if you ever feel like pets are very thorough. And so, if you feel like it either they want your attention, or you want to hold them that's fine you want to do that, during session that's not gonna affect anything."
13079.0,Patient,"Oh, thank you, I appreciate that but yeah my cats me like everything i'll probably talk about them in therapy there a huge reason why I don't kill myself because, like they would wonder where I went and that just weighs heavy on me, you know. So yeah they really motivated me to go back to therapy and take care of the things going on around me."
726.0,Provider,"motivator tour thing yeah. call me that, thank you for letting me know that, so I will keep that in mind when we have our session so I don't you know. Sound dismissive of in any way, I appreciate the honesty around this so that's that's good. thing."
13079.0,Patient,"Okay, thank you, I really appreciate meeting you. It was pretty cool I. I can tell it's going to be pretty good already like you some very like understanding and stuff so i'm excited to work with you."
726.0,Provider,"yeah I am too so, and please feel free anytime i'm comfortable with anything i'm always open to hearing it so you know. don't ever feel like just because of the therapist you can't tell me it's this isn't your time this is for you, so if something's coming up for you it's I think it's good to have a conversation about us so that we can kind of like clear anything out that's that would be. bothersome later on for you."
13079.0,Patient,"Thank you, I really appreciate that I hope you have a great day. Are we done. Just to make sure. yeah okay. Thank."
726.0,Provider,You bye.
