298.0,Provider,hi i'm just pulling up your record right now how have your mood then.
17201.0,Patient,"i'm pretty good for the most part, I mean. it's been a hectic. Month but. A lot of not necessarily just with my mood, but with my school and I had this whole. sort of crisis of an old friend of mine, and I was helping him out of a bad situation there's a lot of stress, but and pass it on now and."
298.0,Provider,Settling in.
17201.0,Patient,They were pretty solid group I guess.
298.0,Provider,How can I help you today.
17201.0,Patient,I mean.
298.0,Provider,"I know we need to do a medical check in or did that, is there anything else. I can help you with."
17201.0,Patient,"I don't know I mean I guess it's we maybe have a little time. I. i've just been curious about. i'm not i'm not unhappy with the you know my response to my current medication, but. I haven't really tried anything else, and I was wondering if there was maybe because I noticed like over Christmas break I wasn't taking. Any adderall and then like maybe the first day I started taking it again. There is a little bit of restlessness and maybe some like mild teeth grinding. I was wondering if. You know what generally like the. Side effects are with with other similar medications."
298.0,Provider,"i'm. A lot of people can't do adderall because they feel a crash, and they feel like they get irritable after they go off of that are all. Side effects profile is usually not eating insomnia, those sort of thing. you're not on your on a kind of logos of adderall I don't know if it's enough for you is and. I don't know if you want to try something else."
17201.0,Patient,"Well yeah that's the thing I just never really tried anything else, and I was wondering just what other. Or maybe just so I could look into it a little more to. You know what other drugs would really be appropriate."
298.0,Provider,"So. um there's the vibe down, which is, if you have to fail, like to have the less expensive stimulants and then insurance will look at. paid for by Bam it's more of a cleaner form of adderall there's instant relief adderall there's concert, which is on the Ritalin side, so you have adderall on one side of stimulus and you have Ritalin. A lot of people who feel like they have side effects to adderall that like restlessness do well on the Ritalin side."
17201.0,Patient,"What. So real it as a different method of of action, then, then, then."
298.0,Provider,"Usually adult respond better to adderall and Ritalin but if I have an adult who doesn't respond well to adderall i'll try them on Ritalin and it may be the answer. And you're welcome to look up ADHD medication and see if maybe you don't even want to go a stimulant route, maybe you'd like to go a blood pressure route or an antidepressant route, those are option to."
17201.0,Patient,yeah i've just. always been very reluctant to consider starting it like depressants because of the you know the dependence that can that can build on right.
298.0,Provider,"Sometimes. If you want to get more effect, out of a medication, then the idea would be to go higher on the adderall that you're taking, but if you're having side effects."
17201.0,Patient,"I don't think I don't think I do want it, I wouldn't want to take for that role."
298.0,Provider,"Then you know where I was going with this, the higher the dosage, the higher the side effects. So medications that I probably like you to look up is called stress Tara."
17201.0,Patient,Let me make a note here.
298.0,Provider,I have some people who really liked the medication called most daffodil.
17201.0,Patient,first one was stroh Tara. And what was the second one.

298.0,Provider,You didn't get to be able to find it.
17201.0,Patient,And are there. Other generic. Drugs closer to adderall or.
298.0,Provider,So strict Tara is not closer to add a row. modafinil is more closer debt debt. adderall and that it is a stimulant. But you know you can read about it and see what. People.
17201.0,Patient,Say yeah I look into it.
298.0,Provider,"And then make another appointment and we'll have them, you know, maybe a deeper conversation. About okay all right, well, thank you, Andrew anything else to talk about are we okay to go."
