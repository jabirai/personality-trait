So these are some more ideas just for self care. i'm basically doing things that you enjoy of course i'm. Fishing is one of them, I actually like fishing, as well as very, very peaceful. But other things, of course, you can a is worth taking care of yourself as making sure that she regular meals getting enough sleep caring for your person I hatching anything else they maintain good health. Making sure that you make self care for you are already I know that you work a lot and that you're a father and so, sometimes with those responsibilities we kind of put ourselves last but also making sure that it is important. And that you also. know that you are also just as important as your other responsibilities so making sure that you actually take our time. On a is not a daily basis, a weekly basis, to make sure that you take enough time to make sure that you are a priority for yourself and to indulge into self care doing things that are fun energizing things like that, when was the last time, Mr Gary you took a vacation. So if you could go anywhere, what would be ideal vacation for you."

When do you feel like you can achieve that desire and actually go camping."
3041.0,Patient,This summer.
740.0,Provider,"The summer okay. Perfect okay so um. let's See also talks about specific goals for yourself like more for walks or i'm. telling you basically i'm taking on more time know being intentional ego being intentional regarding to get more time to do things for yourself outside of work and being a day. Making self care a heavy like eating an apple doesn't eliminate health problems using self care just wants won't won't have much effect on reducing your stress so that's why i'm. Being able to. What is the word on fire means being able to engage there you go man everything ah, consistently and self care. You want to make it a heavy you want it, you want it to be a part of you, you want it to be something that you're engaging on a regular basis, and not just something every blue moon because, of course, even though. You know i'm saying you have a good, healthy way of a limit, I mean handling your stress there also. Are ways that you can minimize it all together by making sure that you that you make time for yourself. So you can engage in new activities or you can continue to engage in all activities, you can find things that you can do on a weekly basis, because I know we can go Okay, maybe week I know you can't go fishing every day. You came in a week, if you choose to, but sometimes you can't make it depending on the weather and things like that so just really finding other things, there are more attainable that you can do a weekly basis to kind of to kind of help you make self care a habit. of setting boundaries, of course, how is your boundaries."
3041.0,Patient,Good.
740.0,Provider,yeah do you feel like it's easier for you to say boundaries or do you feel like it's kind of difficult.
3041.0,Patient,easier.
740.0,Provider,mm hmm So what are some of the things that you do. When you set boundaries.
3041.0,Patient,stick to it again. falter. don't go places in their. potential.
740.0,Provider,"mm hmm. that's good that's right So there you go that's good i'm also you know in regards to dealing with people. How do you how to use their boundaries of people, especially people who. Who basically don't have it doesn't seem like they have limitations in regards to have a treat you how to use the same banners that people."
3041.0,Patient,Should. Say we're going. To. Look.
740.0,Provider,"Okay, so so i'm so very assertive in regards to communication don't really have a problem being blunt and let people know how you feel. yeah good. So it says a few minutes of self care is better than no care at all. So a few minutes will self care is better than nothing. One of the things. Like I said I know is it might be difficult for you to do it every day because you work so much, but at the same time, one of the things that I will say is to at least try to take even if there's a few minutes of whatever it is. Focusing on doing something for you said it, that means meditation there means reading a chapter of a book if that means. Even watching TV for a little bit um cookie yourself some dinner or whatever going for a walk whatever it is just try your best to try to implement that as much as possible, you want to make sure that you are. Adding in more healthy habits, the more you engage in recovery, and of course you're doing a great job, the more you gave engaged in recovery you i'm saying you want to make sure that you are. Adding in more healthy habits that you're adding in more things to make you productive and to make you better, and so this is just something, this is just a way or two they can help you create more healthy habits and reduce stress at the same time, so. It talks about unhealthy activities don't Count of self care so like substance abuse overeating and other unhealthy behaviors might hide uncomfortable emotion, probably they cause more problems in the long run. outside of. You being in recovery and no longer using substances have you identified any other unhealthy behaviors that you feel like you need to get rid of."
3041.0,Patient,know which location than zero.
740.0,Provider,"that's perfect good deal, so the last thing it says is to keep up with self care, even when you're feeling good so even when you start to feel good it is best to continue to keep up with it, so that you can continue to so that you can continue to feel good, I think. There is a hard thing when people start doing things because they're like Oh well, I feel better now is on how to do it more now it's the whole purpose is to continue to do so that you can constantly feel good so that's it. So let me ask you this, once again I got a question. um. You are you what's today today's Wednesday.
