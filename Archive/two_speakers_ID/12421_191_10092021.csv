12421.0,Patient,yeah.
191.0,Provider,"Well buprenorphine is an assembler class of family it's an opioid okay and buprenorphine is a safe medicine as a safer Madison even at higher doses. But you can overdose with it, and so the things that increase your risk of opioid overdose on what people morphine is the same thing that can increase your risk of overdose and with like. Other pain pills and opiates so that includes your alcohol, though sedative type medicines like muscle relaxers sleeping pills xanax out of and klonopin value so we really don't want you to mix those with the before morphine okay."
12421.0,Patient,Okay um I was going to ask you. Not not long term but. My as deep as we call a man i've been like nightmares and we call it a.
191.0,Provider,Night stuff.
12421.0,Patient,"yeah and use injury like. US injury yeah and. I was wondering if you give me a quarter or shot him until that is over, with."
191.0,Provider,What the thing about it is that when you have using dreams. Early in recovery that's not uncommon. They have to decrease uh huh so because dreams that doesn't mean that you've done something bad or something's wrong with you that doesn't mean you're going to go use. A lot of people have using.
12421.0,Patient,The night terrors of stuff your your psychology has actually have you on pros pros olson.
191.0,Provider,"to hell, are you taking your presentation."
12421.0,Patient,"Yes, and I told him. That they were really working and he was doing he at me up to three milligrams. and"
191.0,Provider,"So make certain you talk to talk to you you're seeing a psychiatrist this week talk with them now, are you having any cravings or withdrawals with the buprenorphine. mona's okay. So no correct so and so that's good, so I know when we've talked your dose has always been adequate So what we already always tell patients is keep doing your therapy. And so, if you keep doing your therapy and you keep getting stronger a lot of patients do get scared because they're having the US and dreams. But you know some that doesn't mean you're going to use that doesn't mean you're doing something wrong patients often have that and then what they notice is if they keep persevering and keep not using the dreams decrease in frequency okay. yeah talk with your therapist about that and try not to get afraid of the dreams okay and talk with your psychologist you see psychiatrists this month okay. Tell them about the nightmares and night terrors and things that you're having so your therapy your subconscious is already addressing it because you're on several medicines to take care of what you're dealing with so just talking with him okay. Okay yeah. All right, then, so thank you i'm a look forward to seeing you again for group and michelle's gonna look forward to seeing you too okay. Okay you're you're increasing your therapy you start with two groups this week coming in your primary groups what Rochelle and then you'll see.
