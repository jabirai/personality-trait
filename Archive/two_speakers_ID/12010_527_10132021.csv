12010.0,Patient,Hello.
527.0,Provider,"hey David, how are you."
12010.0,Patient,doing well and yourself.
527.0,Provider,"i'm doing well, thanks. yeah so how's things going in. Two weeks since I last saw yeah."
12010.0,Patient,Let me just collect my earphones real quick. sorry about that. Much better.
527.0,Provider,yeah all right well phil man. it's been a few weeks.
12010.0,Patient,"um it's been kind of a rough couple of weeks. Okay, really. Just with time management trying to set boundaries, with what we just discussed yesterday and group therapy setting boundaries and. Communicating and using. assertiveness without being coming off as anger. Yes, i'm i'm kind of slipped a little bit in school and fall behind so i'm kind of playing catch up right now. Okay um I think it's just to due to the amount of stress i'm taking on that. Work and not setting certain boundaries, with my boss was also the owner of the restaurant and. On my more of a yes man. Okay, yes, yes, yes and. So i'm like no. God. So i've been kind of having a really rough time kind of saying no to people and understanding, like I am I can't take it on, then I shouldn't feel guilty for not being to do it."
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
12010.0,Patient,"So I think that's been a big part of it, and then. yeah just glue what I think would work, mostly that's kind of affecting the school. dropping the kind of feeling a little on the depressed side and."
527.0,Provider,yeah. A lot of stuff going on.
12010.0,Patient,"Oh yeah i'm visual work it's um. I just have this i'm a huge emphasis I feel like people what they're going through and I try to like you know, help them along, but I kind of forget to help myself along too."
527.0,Provider,yeah yeah So where do you feel like you need to kind of set some limits and boundaries for yourself.
12010.0,Patient,"i'm just knowing to say no, and when it appropriate to say no, and i'm not filling to. handle myself more professionally more than a friend when it comes to my employees, because I think that's where I kind of screw up on. Our he's kind of give them chances and I let them kind of do it over the wall and then it's the lack of respect, but a time that. It starts piling up that's when they explode and it's like kind of that blowing up moment, and it could honestly fire both the people and just. Try to other people I would but I tried I contacted my boss about it so we're kind of moving forward with letting go one of them, but we just have to do it the right way, not the verbal warning the right up and then. I didn't go. Sure, though. yeah I think just having that person there's just. really bringing me down because I took on more like fear stress and emotional level and I. don't as if, like. A family member would have done, but I didn't remember that i'm his boss not his family, even though no work as a happy family, we all."
527.0,Provider,"yeah yeah I mean that's a tough role to be in as far as you know, being a boss, and having to set those limits and not have that personal aspects kind of filter and. yeah be able to kind of separate that out for yourself yeah."
12010.0,Patient,"yeah that's the huge challenge i've been having lately, and then I finally asked yesterday I kind of got the guts because I do a lot for the restaurant too much running from front to back and employees counseling them and scheduling and dealing with just really random things happening. One thing to the other fellows like. And I wasn't getting paid sufficiently enough for it, and knowing that there's somebody who i'm doing their job to and they're making $7,000 a month and I was making nowhere. Close to that."
527.0,Provider,yeah.
12010.0,Patient,"I finally got the guts yesterday, and I was like listen, you know i've been logging in what I do you guys call it my days off you guys are messaging me my days off email to me i'm constantly workout fly I really have the separation. You guys are considering that it also in nursing students so. My plate is huge right now and it's really hard for me to even try to get through levels up his plate because i'm my dedication, is to work, because I need to pay bills, of course, so."
527.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
12010.0,Patient,"I finally told her like no i'm doing this, I have a list of time, you called me and i'd like list of emails I know that we know we have a family aspect, but like there's like discern boundary have to set and. You guys are crossing that boundary constantly and i'm allowing it happened and I can't anymore, and if you are in a cross that boundary, then I think I should be on salary and I should be making this much a month, so I pay my rent my bills without feeling stress or feeling like not. appreciated enough. yeah oh definitely. On the bright side of everything it help because Disneyland has reached out to me, and they want me to work for them and help them, create a tea room and run it as a head chef for them, they offered me a huge amount of money, but i'm. great opportunity. yeah it's really flattering and i'm really showed me like oh my God like because they've said they've been in the restaurant like we've been there a few times you just we just do incognito. we've traveled."
527.0,Provider,All day. that's awesome.
12010.0,Patient,"They knew all about me they knew everything that they knew I was self taught chef and he was like we. know you see what 100 people a day and it's impressive that you're on open three days a week, and take no as much money we make we make up about $30,000 a weekend so. make her a lot of money. amy well. But like I told her I go no it's a great opportunity and it's something that I would think about considering but i'm i'm not really money driven kind of person. So I feel like you know they could offer me all this money but with Disney you're basically regulated and you kind of like on strings with them. yeah so I was like I. Probably won't be happy, so, is it really worth the money and I told her and maybe they kept they're still trying to. fix me wages they're trying to get those."
527.0,Provider,Old yes.
12010.0,Patient,You have the keys to the rational they've already have my keys my own.
527.0,Provider,But it was a real wake up call.
12010.0,Patient,Because it's like oh my God this multibillion dollar company wants to hire me and give me for reigns to. create something for them. I was like wait a minute i'm not being paid enough. To my word that is not you.
527.0,Provider,"Yes, yes, definitely. So where's that leave things for your place then like now that you've kind of put things out on the table, like to. Is there any discussions or."
12010.0,Patient,"We had a long discussion yesterday about it and. She pretty much see where i'm coming from and she said her and her husband has had this discussion within each other and her husband is the one that's really it seemed like you know this this kid i'm 28 but no there or so. yeah really just saw so much more than we're offering him. And that's what she came to me and said, you know it's so fun, I feel like you read my mind, because. I really wanted to have a conversation with you. about putting you on salary salary, because I mean i'm making maybe two hours more than anybody else."
527.0,Provider,yeah and the servers already significant yeah.
12010.0,Patient,"collected $100 and tips and i'm just like Oh, you make more money. And i'm writing this for."
527.0,Provider,"them right exactly good for you, for stepping up so are they. kind of talking through and going to come back to you with like."
12010.0,Patient,"she gave me a number. And again with the conference I said no, I said no, that doesn't make any sense to me because that's just actually doing all in my pocket and that doesn't change my position here didn't change anything, for me, financially and comfortably. Especially because i'm putting off my actual goals and dreams of being a nurse on a chef so i'm sacrificing a lot for you guys, I think you could sacrifice financially for me, knowing that you guys are in a very financially stable place and i'm not per se, I mean I don't live. I don't struggle to pay my bills, but it's like it's would be nice to start a nice savings."
527.0,Provider,"well. Just be compensated for the work that you're you're doing and providing and you know, providing for them to as well you know so yeah it's definitely you know needs to be you know advocated for your compensation for the work you do."
12010.0,Patient,"yeah I think you made a good happy medium, it just i'm. Just really been just depressing me just I go I don't even I used to like look forward to going to work with my employees and look at everybody and then they're complaining about the most dumbest things is like oh my God, I just have a team of Queens and."
527.0,Provider,yeah for treatment and it's like I know i've tried to meet them halfway.
12010.0,Patient,"I asked them to do certain things for me to do and do it, and then the guy that i'm talking about Harrison is his name. I asked her a few times like hey I need your food hunters card, I need your vaccination car you don't have actually vaccine card that's fine I can't force you to get it, but wear a mask when you're at work. Right it's a very small kitchen so it's very tight and then I was like I need you have. Non slip shoes and helped farmer walks in."
527.0,Provider,Re.
12010.0,Patient,"You don't get in trouble, I do and it's like it'll hopefully hunters card again probably. i'm on the line here so."
527.0,Provider,Right right.
12010.0,Patient,"New job at red lobster and he came into work and he was like. New shoes new slide step shoes and an apron and I was like oh my God like this is all I need from thinking oh red red lobster maybe do it, it was like. So."
527.0,Provider,yeah.
12010.0,Patient,"Red lobster who you just started working for even working for me for a long time i'm not like him money i've given him his pay early. shaven days off because he's. Starting his own therapy treatments it's like that sounds like you know, take a day to get your mental health status or all that stuff so as I. said i've done. All this for you and then this company comes in and then you're like oh I gotta go follow their rules and regulations, you know kind of F you and you're."
527.0,Provider,"Right you're right exactly. Definitely definitely. yeah exactly well, I mean that's kind of how I saw it to."
12010.0,Patient,"That I asked him like hey you know, did you give them your postcard on your vaccine cars oh yeah email it to them, and I was like well, can I get that by chance, he was like well, I mean, I guess, I could do it for you like it's just a simple email. Okay, it looks like it was."
527.0,Provider,"That simple yeah Why is why we, why is this an issue then."
12010.0,Patient,"yeah so he sent him the next day, but you can have an attitude for the rest of the day, and now, as I told my my partner's Mr chef as well, and I was like i'm done I don't want to do this anymore. Maybe his attitude is just not worth my time and energy, I don't have that I don't have time and energy right."
527.0,Provider,Right right.
12010.0,Patient,"yeah so like. Going forward, and then I called the boss and said hey you know I learned fight anybody. never went down. Get the hell out for the day but. So I asked her out what how do I go about it, and she said, you know go forward with fits me his last time sheet and I did that and then my partners in the kitchen talking to the guys because he's the sous chef so he's doing the lowdown for the day."
527.0,Provider,And sure.
12010.0,Patient,"I get off the phone and my parking lots of new cycle, I feel so bad, and I was like why I was born, I was like oh Harrison oh i've got his I need this last time shape because i'm excited to share this with you, maybe go today. But that's why I feel bad. what's going on, he was like he just showed me his coach wallet that he just purchased and his first purchase and a couple months because he hasn't had money for himself me funny in a good financial place or they could just give me one more chance. Your host courage and woke up work a worked up for me."
527.0,Provider,Yes.
12010.0,Patient,"So setting those boundaries, with my partner to and understanding that no right worker not partners. Right I can't do I have nine made a decision, I made a decision because. She was also complaining about him and complain about his you know not being being tardy coming installing. Yes, like alcohol because he's hungover or. Just sure things that are this shouldn't be happening. Right, and so I took that consideration because you know my assistant managers coming to me my servers are coming to me complaining by him so that's enough people to say. Yes to the collateral that yeah."
527.0,Provider,"it's not just one person, and you know it's a purse personality conflict it's definitely impacting the whole environment yeah."
12010.0,Patient,"So I set boundaries with him as well, which is a huge step from calls like okay. i'm going to do this, but he's no longer by monkey no longer in my circus these your monkey in your circles and you need to retrain him stand by his side need to have them focus, you need to regulate him and if I feel at any moment from. 8am to 4pm and he's here that something's not right i'm pulling the strings and saying i'm not doing it and so he did pretty good day. And I thought you know what no took him outside and say just so you know I don't think you're aware, but you're like on the verge of just me just dropping you and just cutting this all off it's not working out for me per se. you're lucky that game felt sorry for you and wants to work with you. But I don't honestly I really don't want to work with you anymore i've done enough five helped you out, I know, when I took you to dinners because you were broke and. I didn't know a lot of things for you, that most employees would never do employees absolutely never cross those boundaries are lines, but I did I felt so sorry for. And I was like just so you know i'm walking watching like a Hawk and at some any point that I feel that you're not meeting me how for you, I mean standard halfway i'm. ready to give you a last check so he yesterday and I just felt like so much better like oh my God, I felt so good to be able to like tell him."
527.0,Provider,sure. yeah yeah.
12010.0,Patient,"Learning those boundaries I just I mean learning the boundary I think it's more was like i'm at my breaking point and I just don't know what else to do so, this is my way of like hey. Do you want to yell and scream and cry today because i'm gonna cry which."
527.0,Provider,"Sure yeah yeah I think it's definitely you know, identifying like your stress level your emotional level and what's going to have to give a little bit like for me to take care of myself and. You know, it is, it is challenging to David that you know, because you and your partner are business partners as well, like. You know, having to navigate that and recognize okay how, how do we manage that and can we continue to manage this yeah it, or do we need to recognize this isn't, the best thing for us in our relationship, like and maybe we need to cut ties business wise. yeah so that it doesn't impact our personal relationship and be okay with that, like be. be able to be respectful of. You know, we gave it a shot and and we've learned a lot about ourselves, and in in our relationship and that's just an area that. it's too challenging and difficult for us to separate that for ourselves, because you know some some spouse, you know some part partners and spouses can work together. yeah but, but a lot of them, you know, but you have to have really clear boundaries of what's work and what's in in in work is work and it. stays there versus you know, bringing it home and so."
12010.0,Patient,"You know, but not really nice those that he he's very helpful I work on he. manages, while I may, which will take some time definitely first was it the best route to go down and I. Question every day that I was there with him and I was like came home, I was like hey, why are you here, oh yeah we live together. Follow me home from work."
527.0,Provider,"Yes, exactly right."
12010.0,Patient,"Get her. dog. i'm so also it took a breaking point with him because you know he voices his opinion law and he kind of undermines me at work and you're like. kind of put me in a certain position, a role at work and I don't play the hierarchy part and I always tell me at the kitchen. Yes, i'm your boss me manager, but the same time, I want you guys to learn everything that I know I want you guys to understand how things run I want you to know. Why doing tori I don't want you to know the recipes I want you to know my position, how did you position, because if I fall down and c's or something happens. yeah once you like oh i'm not a day which job or I could. Do that or I could take that initiative and. I don't play that whole like i'm gonna come in and tell you what to do, it's more like hey guys, you know let's be a team today. I have this set schedule this set menu for the day i've just I know that it's last minute, but I try to keep them on toes by change them any of the two weeks."
527.0,Provider,or I.
12010.0,Patient,slip it in and out of nowhere like okay new menu today because I want them to be motivated and enthused about coming to work and try new things i'm learning. Failure but our.
527.0,Provider,"And challenge in it well. You know, part of that is challenging you know how do you handle transition and change as well, because sometimes that happens, you know, there may be. There may be a shortage of something, and so you have to compensate like Okay, we don't have this ingredient so let's, we have to switch things up and. Keep the business running so. yeah but at the same time, David do you feel like you need to have a little bit more. Authoritative role."
12010.0,Patient,"Okay, so on Sunday, I brought them all together. they're just kind of doing absolutely nothing, and I was like in the kitchen on myself, and I was like hold on no. brought them on the kitchen my partner included, and I said this today's the last day today's a new change and I met my breaking point with all of you, even the servers and. Over time, at that point where i'm gonna walk out grab my keys and that's it you guys figure it out and I don't have to i'm not making enough money. To be here anymore, and to want to be here anymore, and I do love the owners up to like her grandson and but at the same time, my grandmother also implement up decision so. I was like no i'm like i'm done I go now on you're going to walk in with chef jackets clean chef jackets hygiene is a big part of this job because we are working with food. I go i'm not pointing fingers but somebody guys walk in here, and you guys look like complete crap Like you, I do and and walk in any other job. Looking at as well out of bed today, I was like I need nonstop shoes on and I pointed gave up to you know to you as well, because he comes in, with vans and it's like no I don't so you guys you guys all know he's my partner. I Oh, but when we're at work you're doing partner anymore I go here, you also need to be in August of shoes a chef coat your chef pants apron ready to go for the day. Now, like I don't ever regulate the hairnet thing if you're not you don't come in Friday, with a hair net or a hat you're not working with today. So just to be able to like do snap at them and tagging like things are changing."
527.0,Provider,sure.
12010.0,Patient,"The kitchen down for an hour and I decide you guys only to wipe clean I want every wall wipe down every station right done these forest mob before swept and then prep for the next seeding I go in so that's done, then you may go and sit down so like you could lean you could clean. yeah it was like a good. I felt really good able to like put that initiative in but why we had to be on my breaking point to do this."
527.0,Provider,"yeah well I think probably you came out it as a different approach. You know, and think about like when you came into this where was your stress level at that time were you in school at that time, you know how you know where were you at emotionally with things."
12010.0,Patient,And I first started was. coated so there was no school there was nothing. It was yeah yeah yeah yeah so you know you're you're probably add a more like.
527.0,Provider,"Oh, we can make this more of kind of a family type like Rica, you know, have a have a you know, a more relaxed atmosphere and and and maybe worked for a period of time, but as you've gone on or hired new people or made changes, you know the dynamics sound like they've shifted. as well, and so yeah and just you know we've all shifted as well as coven changed, and you know everybody's starting to transition back to more. Normal. yeah exactly and so yeah it's so it's you know, I think, looking at your transition with that too, and that you know it's you know it's okay to have to come in and go, you know timeout let's need to, we need to just all restart here yeah."
12010.0,Patient,"I just feel like if I did I don't do these things, if I get into the I would I probably would have to break down and I felt like. At that point within it's just like sitting there coming home from work i'm so emotionally drained I mean physically just so emotionally drained I want to open my book, and so I know i'm falling behind. with certain things like no i'm like I told them to like this is my last semester, before I get into the nursing Program. This is my. Most dire semester. So the fact that i'm putting. This before my actual goals and dreams, like you, guys aren't really seen my sacrifice here. You guys aren't seeing. That i'm i'm willing to drop the ball on my goals and my dreams and I don't know why I don't know why i'm doing that, when you guys aren't even meeting halfway so it's not worth it for me anymore. And I go and the sacrifice that i'm making I treat you guys so well and I bring your I don't I don't act like the Gordon ramsey that I could be. So, like, if I have to do that in order to get my own goals and dreams forward then that's how it's been and if you don't like it there's a door and I like let me know about your last job."
527.0,Provider,Sure sure.
12010.0,Patient,"So i'm just learning that you know he had to focus on my own end goal and set those boundaries, but the hard part I think would be keeping those boundaries."
527.0,Provider,"Right. Yes, that consistent follow through for yourself yeah yeah."
12010.0,Patient,Wait wait hold your socks.
527.0,Provider,"yeah well, I was going to say what what's going to get in the way for you like what. Where are your maybe like weaknesses or trigger points of vulnerability, for you like. um because I think, being aware of those and knowing okay if somebody comes to me and says man David like i'm just having a bad week like my car broke down and I got to put a new motor in and man can I have an advance on my paycheck for like. You know 500 bucks so I can get my car fixed like. Like you have to be firm, like and make sure you've made it clear, like what are my rules and regulations moving forward if I, because if I do this once, then. it's going to lead yes it's going to it's going to like spiral down it's going to lead back into okay well, but you did it for them so. yeah then it's you know, so I think you have to be hard and fast like where are my boundaries now. Like like no more helping out no more cash advances, no more like. i'm sorry, you know, like you know. it's you know at life, you know. Which life happens, and so, but we're responsible for. You know how are we going to be accountable for our actions to like you, you picking up the nest and keeping them safe and walking them through life is not copying it's not helping teach them either like boundaries."
12010.0,Patient,"Like I am the oldest in the kitchen, besides the dishwasher but he doesn't give me any problems he's. An older guy. His own thing all day so. yeah we watch soccer games like it isn't on this, so he doesn't bother you but i'm i'm the oldest the I think it's 20 920-708-2223. Okay, and then my partner's 27 buddy he's his own category because he works two jobs, like my little bit will need his scheduling and it's it's always nice not having him there answer in a. Nice."
527.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
12010.0,Patient,"What um, so I think it's because I look as a as like Oh, you know, I was at that age, and I know how it sucks to struggle and I struggle to get where i'm at now and I have a. Beautiful two bedroom apartment I can afford it, and before my bills and I always tell me, you know I want that, for them, and I want them to see like this isn't your career so don't. put all your eggs in this basket, this is a tea house, and this has to be a stepping stone for you to for the next level, you know every everybody i've ever hired always moved on to like the last guy he was going to engineer school and graduate so he's not. an engineer, the other guy was waiting for his. job to come back from fedex kovats only make. $1 now they're not bad can't pay you I don't make that so yeah. Nice try."
527.0,Provider,sure.
12010.0,Patient,I think my biggest weakness and the biggest thing to get in the way is understanding that you know they have to. Learn and know the obstacles are going to get in their way in life and know that they how to get through those obstacles like I had to.
527.0,Provider,Say probably wouldn't be the person I am today if I didn't.
12010.0,Patient,"Have those obstacles in my life. Yes, I apartment is a very big emphasis on like."
527.0,Provider,"That. Keep that keep that but have boundaries right, because that is it you know you can empathize with them and go, yes, I understand the struggle. You know what what options or what you know. drawing a blank on words but you know what what resources do you have like. You know what are what are what's your support system like do do have a savings account do you have you know, do you have friends or family, you could reach out to. You know, to. You know, for support during this time, or you know."
12010.0,Patient,"right on my daughter said was. use her as an excuse, and saying you know what I think you should bring this to cheryl instead of David Fitzgerald is the one who."
527.0,Provider,"Was gonna say is there. A set you can that are out of your role and need to. be directed to them, you know. yeah as the business owners."
12010.0,Patient,"So she said, you know they're afraid of her because she's very Stern, and I don't know me i'm kind of i'm not afraid of her by a little more. intimidating intimidating like how'd you get filthy rich like you guys are in different level."
527.0,Provider,"But why are they there, though, you know because it because they do have to set those boundaries for themselves, you know, like it's you know you can be a person, but you also are a business, you know owner to and have to you know you can't just give everything away."
12010.0,Patient,"Exactly exactly she said that you know I don't mind it because they're very generous themselves they're very helpful but she's like let them they asked you, because they know you're going to say yes."
527.0,Provider,Yes.
12010.0,Patient,"I go, let me tell them instead of me, giving you that advance right now how about you do in this business to me. And then I will come across a bmx bikes and they have a huge warehouses like how about you come to the warehouse for a couple days and make the money that you need and. I can't give you the year pay in advance, and so it is do sorry."
527.0,Provider,yeah definitely.
12010.0,Patient,"I go pay you cash and become clean the warehouse are gonna pay you this, if you just do this. And I don't look at that perspective because I mean I don't I can't do is my always thought like Oh, let me go write you a check and i'll pull it out either pay. But like yesterday, I think I drew a line at that point, because I don't ever check their timesheets because we do the old school written on the thing. I don't really pay attention to it and she was oh i'm here to pick up whatever and i'm going to choose to have a meeting with my baker and. kinda events, whatever and I was like can I see those before you take them and then interesting oh yeah sure, and I was like lay them all out. No it's like no these this is, this is not right there they bring their hours now and it's not just one person it's a few and it's probably one guys like a they don't look at it just you know. Whatever it is so I was like what do I do about this, and she was like well, you have to approach them and I was like Noah. hold on I googled it and it said that you have every legal right to adjust the pay their timesheets based on whatever it is like if. You see that they clocked in an hour before they should have you could actually pop them back out because legally your your schedule. So I got new time sheets and I wrote down their exact hours that they were they're not there and I put it in there, so i'm no wait for one of them to maybe approached me like Why am I checked. So small will maybe because you're stealing and then I told her and I because she was I was so offended because i'm so nice to them, I give to them and I run that wrestling it's like i'm the owner. So I feel like. yeah they're stealing from you, but I feel like they're also studying for me like it's not my money, but the way I run it it feels like you're just out of my pocket because I. tried you out so much."
527.0,Provider,Right yeah very disrespectful.
12010.0,Patient,Oh wow. How long has it been going on how. Are you David i'm doing i'm the chef.
527.0,Provider,Right. yeah I just did it and I don't know if I should.
12010.0,Patient,"Let them know hey just so you know i've seen your timesheets and I adjusted it or I read that you know, let it happen again, and then be like just say no, I can terminate you because you are stealing this is stealing."
527.0,Provider,"Well, again, it goes back to what sort of like handbook or rules, regulations, do you have for employees do you have like an employee handbook and now all day."
12010.0,Patient,"Though we have I give them copies of the when they first start I could they get a handbook and they get the recipes and the rubber make new recipes I give it to them in advance, or if it's a day off than I kind of like just surprised. By hd I could do that."
527.0,Provider,sure.
12010.0,Patient,"But we have a handbook in the kitchen at all times that's like face it's like sanitation, how to do the free. prep the fridges, a certain way, because you can't have certain things on one shelf at least another one cross contamination and then I have the health department handbook which is like this is will we have to follow or. We none of us have jobs. Like I don't have. You don't find this so. I know going forward I could maybe sit down and point out to them that what I recognized, and this is like you know your verbal and your written warnings I don't really have to give you their boats, I could actually fire all of you."
527.0,Provider,For a.
12010.0,Patient,"During this. But um I my biggest fear is that is creating animosity, or like an enemy sore or that using that more districts more getting more just because now they're like well. Now you're going to talk about are now you're being a tyrant because you're now putting all these rules and stuff like that."
527.0,Provider,yeah.
12010.0,Patient,But it's awesome.
527.0,Provider,"And I think you can still go back to I i'm implementing these on behalf of the business owners like you know if they have a problem with it, then they can certainly go to the business owners yeah I think that's. that's a fair stance, for you, David. My thought is you know what would it be to call an employee meeting. and say you know I know there's been a lot of changes recently and. Or you know we're we're you know I said we're going to go through some changes recently, so I I wanted to bring us all together. review the handbook ask any questions that you have and just really make clear what the expectations are moving forward here's my role. You know here's your partner's role as sous chef like whatever and just make sure there's clear definitions of everybody's role here and. In in go through reviewing you know and and say you know I had a meeting with the business owners and. There was some discrepancies in the in the timesheets and i'm just making you aware that things have been adjusted and if there's questions. They need to be directed back towards them but moving forward, you know if there are discrepancies and timesheets this is blah blah blah blah blah, you know. Whatever you know, trying to approach it as a community and. Environment maybe like not singling people out but saying you know let's let's use this as an opportunity it's a restart make sure everybody's on the same page ask questions you know, whatever needs to happen so. That yeah so that you feel like you know, and if the business owners, need to be a part of that as well, certainly certainly invite them to that, like, I do think that might be something that might be helpful to."
12010.0,Patient,"I feel like you know, nine and a business owner because she's getting ready to retire her daughters and and take over the she's been working for 20 years she's oh. i'm like I told cheryl yesterday it's like Why am I here on Tuesdays and Thursdays and Wednesdays, and I Why am I going from here for eight hours, and he going to school for six hours, when I by the time I get. home it's 1030 and it's like, but your daughter's never here like Why is she not here she's a general manager and she's running all over this, and she. wants to be included, like I make changes to think well you don't ask me why like why, when I asked you, you know you're not in the meeting so. That you know the day of because that's the way you show up or that's why she coming at 1030 and i'm here at seven in the morning, because I think you as her mother and her. boss should let her know that you can start bringing in these meetings you need to be here and you need to start being a manager managing some of the staff members, because I I can't do it all like as much as I tried to because I. Think i'm such a manic i'm like I got this entire building and. i'm not was not fair, because when i'm not man, a normal and what i'm normal i'm like Okay, this is something's just not right like. adding up for me. yeah so I said no, she needs to that's where their boundary right so like she needs to be a part of this, and she needs to I need to be able to go to somebody besides feel like I should be a chain of. Events a. command I should go to the general manager first that doesn't work, then he would have oh I go straight to the owner, because the gentleman of mine, are you going to do anything about this very um. There is like miss about stuff I could tell her like hey you know this is happening and she's like Okay, I mean I guess we'll figure that out, no that's I guess we'll figure it out, we need to figure it out. Yes, we both lose our jobs. And I she act like we're a team and a call with me use the choice coffee sanitized any new sunshine like we got this we're a team on this. Where are you. yeah we got this or do I got it."
527.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
12010.0,Patient,"yeah so I feel like i'm putting that into play, yesterday I think they had a conversation I I mean I know it's in the picture off, but like I like i'm in my head like I don't care if it's the office anymore, because i'm pissed off. i'm glad i'm bothered I didn't know you get a feel I feel every single day running this thing and understand that i'm at my breaking point and I do all my restaurant you guys don't have a restaurant. Did you have no chef and i'm the only one, I knows all the recipes and i'm doing the connections and everything I could just walk away and say good luck. Right so. I want, I told her the owner, I do need to really put that her head, because if I walk away she don't have a job and she's not making $1,000 and tips a weekend so. I could be a total asshole and say you know California law states that the kitchen should get some of your tips. But I don't do that cuz I know that's her thing whatever, but I mean I can, and I really wanted to, but I could talk show me I could do a lot of things that I don't do, but I if you don't want that to happen, and you need to meet me halfway because."
527.0,Provider,sure.
12010.0,Patient,Right now you're way over here and i'm like.
527.0,Provider,yeah. there's a lot of discrepancy and. yeah and yeah.
12010.0,Patient,"I feel like having her there and saying this is your general manager and she's also part owner, so if you guys have any issues go to her once a kitchen issue, of course, come to me or to do your timesheets i'm responsible your time sheets general managers they're the ones. That pay you out. I will check your time sheets, from now on, because my boy scout you is, and so my solution to was let me send us a copy of the schedule to cheryl every. Every week so that way when she goes gets time we get paid every two weeks she does get he could. Look at our schedule and. Rain at all cuz I was like I don't want to take on another issue. Right right."
527.0,Provider,"Right yeah but if that if this helps the process. You know, to send her that that she can review and and then it's on her. You know, it takes it off of you."
12010.0,Patient,"yeah because honestly, where I stand with it is i'm just doing this until i'm done with the Semester and I don't see myself there in the beginning of the year, I don't see myself like Disneyland as much as that sounds amazing but. I don't see myself being passionate about. Being a chef anymore, I would rather go back to practicing you know vpn and. that's where I was happiest and that's where I was making better money, and then they look better on my resume and I tried to apply for this a program in the fall, so it just makes more sense to me, but my thing is I just oh God, what are they gonna do they walk away. yeah. Like my mom said yesterday, she got that's not your problem, you can either start now hiring chef Lucas graduates little cooler is cool who's the who's the devil. wants to be creative and then we. talk."
527.0,Provider,yeah sure sure.
12010.0,Patient,So i'm definitely not happy i'm not happy. yeah don't have a job I guess highly dislike it yeah yeah.
527.0,Provider,"yeah it does yeah because you're not taking care of yourself in the midst of this like you've you've expended all your energy to everybody else, and so now it's time in and you've put yourself kind of on the back burner at this point, and now. And now the burners hot and you're hot and. yeah so So do you think you think setting these limits. And you know what's your time, you know, can you give yourself a time frame like i'm going to implement this and this process. You know, let them all know and and then you know if it falls apart, it falls apart, like you, have you know that's that's you've put all the responsibility back on. them at this point so you know you've you've put guidelines and direction and support, and you know, training or whatever in place. You know, because every job I mean has rules and regulations, so they have you know consequences if you, you know you're fired if you're playing with your time card, you know you're fired if you're not following the rules so. You know it's not you know if if they don't want to follow the rules, then they they need to you know, then they need to leave. And you don't need to say that, but you just need to say you know these, these are the expectations and guidelines moving. forward at this point."
12010.0,Patient,we're going to say to myself.
527.0,Provider,"Yes, well. I mean you're you have rules and regulations that you have to follow and you're going to lose your job, so you know you know the importance of it, you know. yeah so yeah I think it is, is that validating it for yourself like Yes, this is okay to do this is what you have to do as as a boss, as someone that you know, like. you're doing it because, because you care about those people. yeah but your employees."
12010.0,Patient,"yeah. it's just it's been easier for me to set boundaries and cut off, so I was like."
527.0,Provider,group therapy yesterday.
12010.0,Patient,"I really cut off a lot of people lately and even before this kind of started happening I just noticed this like like I said yesterday, my one friends always come to me with his problems and inside. where's the friendship like there's no friendship is there's no pressure to be given tape or like listening and understanding one another, but it was just me just listening to it, I was like okay like good luck block, you know the next leg. locks you know mute and then. kind of push them I know it's so easy, I felt like such a big relief, but when it comes to work, I know i'm saying, I think, because i'm such a perfectionist i'm so hard on myself, and I want to have everything a certain way, because my ADHD and my OCD diet, we needed to. Follow there I think that's why I get so irritated when things. don't happen, so I think going forward and setting these boundaries and keeping it in play, and you know even writing them down and making a maybe a new handbook or a new rules, regulations and posting it and. I could see it remind myself. Member you. have this. follow through with that I think that's my hardest part is following through with this planning actions and. I yell but I mean that doesn't solve anything it just. Right now, the whole environment is. All off because they're like oh shit he's pissed. I want I. always say something very aggressively and the next shut down I won't say anything for the rest of the day. yeah and that's when they know i'm mad because they're like Oh, it gives us a tool."
527.0,Provider,"yeah which doesn't you know which is not helping you at all to feel more confident in your role either or or trusting yourself so. yeah definitely and that's why I asked if you had a handbook so I was like will make you know if you don't have one you probably need one and and or maybe just review it, and is there revisions that need to be made and and the owner sign off on it and so. You know, because."
12010.0,Patient,"The great thing about is. They they let me do whatever I need to do necessary or I. want so many exciting things office. Did beauty of because most most of time to get like X men email, and the way that you know they make these changes, but she's posted like if it works, and it makes sense to you will make complete sense to me and she's like I trust you. They were $90,000 in debt when I started and now they're. they're making a lot of money for me so. Sure, but the other thing for."
527.0,Provider,"me yeah The other thing to just maybe to help you with accountability and follow through is you know if you present them with this employee handbook with revisions or changes, you know, is there, something that they. At the end of the meeting they sign that they receive the handbook and that they agreed to, and it goes in their record and so you so it gives you that sense like okay i've made it clear and they've signed i've signed, so I have to you know you both signed. off on it so that now, I have to hold myself to that that line and you're out. remembered yeah yeah if that would help you at all, like to just have that extra like okay it's visually I can see this that I find this for myself. And we're having them work mchale liquid say that you signed up saw the new rules sure yeah and it, you know it covers your butt to. You know, honestly, like you know I reviewed this they reviewed this they agreed I you know and it's in writing so. mm hmm I."
12010.0,Patient,"think I can do this, I can follow through."
527.0,Provider,And I you know part of it is. Will this help me get through this short phase of finishing out this role and letting myself. Take a breath focus on my nursing to get to the next step that I want to go to like it will this help enough for me to set these limits to feel better and and focus on what I really want to at this time.
12010.0,Patient,yeah definitely. I need that.
527.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
12010.0,Patient,"Because, at the end, like I said the end goal, because she's no would you still be a. hiring an actual to my partners on a suit actual sous chef I just has he has a title um. by hiring an actual sous chef and then letting him, be the kitchen manager, because he does a great job managing the kitchen but and. being more comfortable saying hey like this is your role, because now start implementing and taking over because, like I said I don't see myself doing this at the end of the year and it's done happiness part, but I really don't want to be a chef. opportunity, and it was fun sure sure yeah well and I think you've also probably learned a lot about yourself to."
527.0,Provider,Through this process.
12010.0,Patient,"And I think it helped me. want to become a nurse more, because I, you know I am such an empathetic empathetic person I can. meet those people on those on those levels, and I can feel these people when it comes to like counting them because you know as we're right now in the ordering preclinical so like right now it's counseling and therapy and. When you're in the. When the patients in the bed you're not just wrapping wrapping their rooms you're also. Company name a lot of people are going through things a lot of people there's like it could be 5156 scenarios and so you have to take that role, until the psychologist or therapist is able to come down because a lot of times they said no. They come from different hospitals are different."
527.0,Provider,places.
12010.0,Patient,"And the way to couple hours, so you take that role and kind of listen and be that guide. So I was like, if I could do it with these employees, I could probably even better at doing it doing something I love."
527.0,Provider,"Exactly exactly yeah. And you're and you're gonna have. Well, and you'll learn your breaking points in nursing. To and know that you're going to have to you're going to have to set boundaries with them too, because they'll probably want to ask you, things that are out of your role and so you're going to have to say i'm sorry, you know I. there's limitations to my role there's limitations to my role is a therapist you know so yeah you have to know those and be be okay to set those you know because you're you're working hard to. get a degree or license that you know that you have you know I have ethical guidelines that I have to follow as a social worker so yeah."
12010.0,Patient,"I saw something yesterday was. when somebody asked you at work, I don't want it's on one of the one of the social media APP is that when somebody asked, something that you don't feel like you don't want to do you just say I don't feel comfortable taking on that task. Right write that down in my hand yes."
527.0,Provider,Yes.
12010.0,Patient,"That worked comfort. comfortable in uncomfortable and the like the trigger words and trigger words in work scenario is once the. owner so here's uncomfortable they have to like. Stop the presses and figure out what's making that person uncomfortable because then you know lawsuits going to play and harassment and HR and all the other stuff. Yes, good to say i'm not comfortable with taking on that."
527.0,Provider,"Yes, yes, exactly. Yes, I like that. Yes. yeah yeah me and maybe that is something for you to think about how do I want to respond if somebody comes at me with this what is an inappropriate response for myself like. If I remove the feeling what what would be the response that would be appropriate. yeah because not letting my emotions like get all wrapped up in in in take charge of the situation like where's my where's my emotional mind where's my my rational mind and how do I come to a best assertive decision there for myself yeah."
12010.0,Patient,"All right, we need to get some more appointments scheduled it looks like."
527.0,Provider,"here's my glasses so. Yes, because you are you're not looking good on compliance David oh. yeah. Alright, so let's look at you have group on. Tuesday Tuesdays yes Okay, so we got to stay away from Tuesdays so let's look at. what's your schedule look like, we need to get probably one more to keep you up to date for October, we need to get one. By the end of the month."
12010.0,Patient,"Mondays and Wednesdays work best for me Mondays are my days or I. kind of don't do anything I kind of just my I worked through the weekend and. Okay Tuesday mornings it's okay after group would work, I do have class from four to nine on Tuesdays and Thursdays and I prepped on Thursdays, so when there's on Mondays and Wednesdays mostly like Mike clear catch up."

12010.0,Patient,"Is there anything on the to meet compliance that isn't just on session that I would have to meet, besides the surveys or."
527.0,Provider,"yeah it's mostly you've had a lot of no show upon appointments so that's what's kind of killed your compliance, yes, so if we can get you back on track with with just attendance. You know, and if things are getting in the way, like reach out like. You know, cancel or you know it's better to. Like if there's something that I can do to help that's going to you know, keep you better on track, but yes, the surveys as well, but yeah what's really kind of dinges is the no shows for groups and and your individual."
