13019.0,Patient,"Making sure that i'm here on time today. I had a really hard time. My alarm didn't go off on my phone I had several other things going on. So i'm glad to be here today, how are you."
724.0,Provider,"i'm doing all right and it, as I say, life happens on. Sometimes. Like the things that we're trying to plan to do that doesn't always work out that way, unfortunately."
13019.0,Patient,So do I see you just once a month.
724.0,Provider,it's supposed to be twice a month. Like at that's basically the standard and sometimes they have circumstances where patients will be seeing more than twice a month. But you get weekly groups too so like the.
13019.0,Patient,"Time right now to work that out with my with my hours there's an APP at my ever working there's an APP I guess to schedule. But i'm not sure that i'll ever be able to schedule exact days off It may be that I can request certain days so right now i'm having an issue with only being available for 30 minutes for my weekly group when it's usually from six to seven. run only been able to attend for 30 minutes at a time so i'm trying to figure out, you know I am office next Tuesday, but what I can do to maybe schedule a different group, so I have to type of care navigation to get that arrange."
724.0,Provider,yep and then. I guess like um So what are you doing what's the conflict exactly work.
13019.0,Patient,"Just i'm at work at the time and i've been taking my lunch break but it's only 30 minutes. or group after two minutes, so they did tell me that I could find maybe another group."
724.0,Provider,yeah absolutely.
13019.0,Patient,My for my days off i'm just gonna have to arrange scheduling through my job is amazing.
724.0,Provider,"Okay, so since the last time you and I talked on were you able to get stable housing."
13019.0,Patient,"Okay, I left the place that I was at some really strange thing happened, it was a really bad situation and everything was good. And this week for this week, I have a place where i'm at because i'm working here but next week, I will need to contact somebody to help me with that with that an arrangement and. So I contacted a place, maybe to help me get into housing because i've done everything I can to to get an apartment and I still have not been able to do so, so um. But what happened this last week I wound up going back to back to the place, I just paid her again and I had three days to go and she's going through the Court process some she's being evicted for having your new that that that was."
724.0,Provider,Good yeah there's some like you said some weirdness about on whether or not they were going to like close the place down on or or. Right right.
13019.0,Patient,"He does license to be running a place like that, but I didn't I didn't I wasn't so much concerned about that at the time, because she was being evicted and I knew that could be a month before the chicken he actually. mentioned that to her, I said Well now, I said i'm having to leave and you're having to leave where we both know what it's like to be evicted. When she heard me say that she took it very personally and she said, what do you know about this eviction you know, and she went off. she's Polish and so she takes everything very literally and and became very offended well she winds up attacking me at some point she hits me and I wound up having yeah I went up having to go to the hospital. What I did everything to avoid the conflict and she even took my stuff in through it and here's what I think it is for months now she's she or for a month now she's had this pressure on her to go to court, and I think she started thinking that I was in on it. Oh you're thinking because, like I said there's the language barrier. And I think she started thinking that I knew something about it so she she took her anger out on me and I wound up at the hospital and I thought. Good me I thought that they might take me somewhere to give me a place for safe for people so. It was up to me and I was still waiting on my my apartment to come through or some word on an apartment I live every day and I haven't, so I do have a place right now for business, so that I can go to work, but I don't want to do so. I did talk to your counselor. Maybe I can let them know that I talk to you all soon that might that might be helpful, I don't know."
724.0,Provider,yeah I mean had have you exhausted the like this state housing authority like like holidays and all that kind of stuff have you.
13019.0,Patient,"talked to them. They do have something going on right now for renters and I can't seem to find a place where it applies to someone who wasn't renting and not making payments, because they're trying to help all the people who couldn't pay their rent during."
724.0,Provider,The. moratorium or whatever it's called.
13019.0,Patient,So. that's kind of what was going on this past week and. I didn't match.
724.0,Provider,So you went to the hospital what kind of injuries would happen.
13019.0,Patient,"She had she she tried to grab me and throw me into the wall, but I just sort of maintained my position and I didn't let her push me into the wall and she she she held up and hit me in the side of the face. I remember, I saw a light, so I was the hospital but here's where it gets really weird so i'm at the hospital and they did a cat scan, but if you if you have a concussion it's not really going to show anything a cat scan. And so they did tell me that I had a concussion but then it got really strange, the police did come up there, but nobody addressed it and they sort of just let me go so and. It wasn't because of my situation I don't know they just didn't spend a lot of time, I really upset they're very busy place."
724.0,Provider,that's not an excuse that if you were assaulted.
13019.0,Patient,me after so Karen. was just weird was very strange and.
724.0,Provider,They take a statement from you. If they were going to press charges or.
13019.0,Patient,"You know I don't know that punishments work I think she was under a lot of stress, but I think I just needed to make sure to have a report in case something."
724.0,Provider,Good absolutely.
13019.0,Patient,i'm not trying to throw some of these are having a lot of problems in jail I she just wasn't herself at the moment.
724.0,Provider,"Okay that's that's really. You know altruistic of you, so I mean."
13019.0,Patient,"Well, I just think she just really rather than herself so. I didn't deserve to be treated every. So that. We can you don't need to be."
724.0,Provider,"yeah I mean you can't be putting your hands on people, despite you know, whatever it is that's going on in your personal life, you need to have show some restraint, but that is you, you are definitely taking the higher ground so i'll applaud you for that so. We able to secure your property from her her residency or what."
13019.0,Patient,"I don't know what's going to happen and i'm sure she's being evicted i'm sure she'll she'll have to close down for whatever she was doing I don't know. i'm just not there and I love, so my belongings there like to go back and get some other things, but I just left them I just left it alone, I had trouble to go back and try this to get something. Better right to be there."
724.0,Provider,"yep well what you could do is you could get a police escort there now that there's been a report that she did. You know attack you if you call the police and you're like hey. You know, by the way, I have some of my belongings at this residency, I would like to go there and collect them but I don't want to instigate another issue, so if you could send a. patrolman there to escort me, so I can go collect myself on that that's an option, they can do that, they do do that type of stuff so um. It happens a lot say like in like domestic violence issues and situations like that, where it's like all right cool. I have to leave my house, but I have to go back there and get stuff and I don't want is any problems, so I needed a witness and, if I can have a cop there as my witness then that'll de escalate, a lot of. Potential issues, so they can go and you do have a right to your property despite whatever situation she might be in your stuff is your stuff and she can hold that. She can hold your property essentially so that's one option if you want to go and get your stuff back, I would just call the COPs and be like, so I had an incident at this place. This is the i've made a statement two nights ago, do you have like the like the case ID number or anything like that the report ID."
13019.0,Patient,"yeah and it was just little stuff like like shares and and and makeup bag, I mean things that are really life altering."
724.0,Provider,"Not nothing that okay well alright well in the future if you run into a situation like that in the future, you. Take take that information, I suppose um So what are you doing for work currently."
13019.0,Patient,"I am working at the pharmacy at walgreens or i'm working at walgreens pharmacy. i'm trying to get back into the pharmacy so that I can have a different position there. But I have to start as an associate so so that's kind of been an interesting thing to to. I think i'm working with a couple people that are really young one of the guys is like 18. Which is. Different position it's giving me a different perspective and that's why i'm having to look at it right now and and then I once I get everything situated, you know I wanted to go back into finishing. I haven't started, I was going to go into business. Even if it was just nonprofit for a little while is want to do, coaching part of my foundation and my education is encroaching. spiritual awareness meditation that's what I was coming out here to see it was a dharma training program but remain closed, and then I had to live on my savings. And I said Okay, the only intelligent thing I can do at this point is to take a job, no matter what the job is to put something in my bank account, because I could not for see how long I was going to have to be living off of limited savings. rate is good and everything so i've lost my family i've lost my friends i've lost the last of my business association or someone that I would have had business contact with I lost. i've lost a lot of people that pass I died I don't have any family, I can turn to you in that way for financial security or or any help or assistance. And it's hard to get that across to people when you lose this many people, you know what do you do so i'm really having to that's a goal, this week, hopefully, I can reach out online or get get involved with some some social contacts. I am working a lot, but I really need to reach out to some people or i'm not going to have a. or friendships just just for the right of being social I don't I don't have that right now so."
724.0,Provider,"um. Is there anybody I can look up on here for like housing for you, while I have you here."
13019.0,Patient,"If you can think of anything. I think I have to go through county to get any assistance from Los Angeles, is, I went, the first thing I did when I saw the danger sign was I went to Santa Monica and their housing authority told me they had nothing available and nothing to offer so. As much as I would like to to leave and go to some some brighter options there's just not really any options, right now, and I have to put some like I said money back in my bank account. Even if I was to fly away and to move somewhere or found a different school that I could go to you, I still have to have some sort of money to live on, you know, so this is all I can do right now. I maintain my maintain my counseling so."
724.0,Provider,So currently is the employment stable enough that you can depend on it.
13019.0,Patient,"Yes, yes everything's there. I don't have to have some i'm always wanting to supplement my income, with some sort of side work that I can do, but i'm limited right now, because I have no private space. Right each place that i'm staying has other people around me so. here's a here's another thing, of course, after all this happened, I thought about going, you know they do have places for abused or bad as people. might be a hospital setting, but the problem there is and i've experienced this in the past. When I had another traumatic event and not necessarily like this one, I hadn't had some really bad trauma in the past. I wanted up in a hospital setting, but the problem there is you can't work on anything during the week, they will give you access to your phone or your tablet they will. You don't have a lot of time to look up phone numbers, when you leave their institution or their place, they give you phone numbers, they give you resources but they're not really helping me through the work. They don't really you don't have any time to get anything done and you me, for sure can't work while you're there. Because I thought about well what if I just needed to go to that maybe that would get them started on some housing for me. But it's really about option when you're standing there ready to leave, and you have nowhere to go still and everything's put off into the future, you know. So I thought about a lot of things so right now it's just me putting one foot in front of the other for myself and having to just work and until i've got enough money to make another move. Unless there's something you can think of now, I told you, I did speak to a place down here they they directed me to some. charitable organization or some church. And they may be able to help me get into an apartment maybe it would be good if I could give them your name and let them know that I was talking to you or maybe they could contact you if they needed some fruits, that I was getting counseling or whatever the cases. But other than that I don't think there's anything that you'd be able to help me do it other than looking at the number, maybe for."
724.0,Provider,You i'm trying to see what la county's housing authority.
13019.0,Patient,Okay tracking and i'll let you.
724.0,Provider,Know like I can multitask so. It was skilled multitasker. So you've talked have you talked with anybody from the housing authority for the city of La.
13019.0,Patient,"I not yet I did I did try to write to Los Angeles county and I think something happened in the meantime and I didn't get to follow through with it, but I will do it again. But let's see if I can copy and paste. Where i'm working so."
724.0,Provider,see if I can put this in the chat. Like a pen and paper.
13019.0,Patient,"You know I don't have pen and paper, but maybe you could send it to me that I could take a screenshot."
724.0,Provider,This that's going to be when I say.
13019.0,Patient,i'm going to walk this way there's someone who's joining me in this room now so i'm going to go to another room.
724.0,Provider,"When you see that. It shows up in there, which that's a little weird."
13019.0,Patient,"Okay, yes, I do see it i'm going to take a picture, what can you do, one more time. Or is it in the chat."
724.0,Provider,yeah it's in the chat box so. what's going on.
13019.0,Patient,"All right, thank you very much."
724.0,Provider,that's one thing.
13019.0,Patient,"All right. The main thing is that I was doing everything responsible that I could be productive like i'm always asking myself what else can I do. To be responsible and productive at this minute and I really feel like i'm covering all my bases and doing all that I can and maintaining you know what's my next move going to be is a constant thought so. i'm really I don't know any other answer you know, and when I came out here, I knew it would be a risk any direction that I went I almost went to New York. there's a couple places overseas and England that I thought about going to that any place that I went it was going to be a risk, because it was after coven or during coven I guess code isn't really over yet. So virus. is really impacted a lot of lives, and it really changed the outcome of my situation, because nothing was going to be available to me, the way it would have been if I if I had taken off I set out to do this before that, and it just happened so fast that. Now, I just have to take action to the best of my ability, you know I can't I can't lean on too many outside sources beyond myself. or i'm going to be just losing time that I could actually be working on that's what I found for the most part. Even going and sitting at a place where they get offered me counseling isn't really an option if i'm not going to be able to do any work to gain anything you know, like we just said i've already said that so just having someone to listen today chuck is is is really good, so thank you."
724.0,Provider,yeah no worries.
13019.0,Patient,"bouncing the ball off the wall, but. Next time we'll have something written out that we could talk about some more towards some deeper therapy or are you getting you getting to know my. My specific situation, but today. was what was on my mind mainly what didn't happen this week."
724.0,Provider,"And it's hard to get into like. like that, like like you said, like at the more intricacies when you're something like the basic environmental factors are are super on stable like. You know if it was me i'd be like I don't really have time to worry about anything other than X, Y Z right now I really need to get these things done before I could even really think about anything extra curricular at this point, and having a stable living environment is top priority."
13019.0,Patient,"Yes, that's that's, the main thing is i'm spending money that I needed to go towards my first and last month's rent just stabilize right now. In it, there was nothing I could have done at least i've got that a lot of people who are in this situation, made a bad choice or they didn't plan well enough I planned to the maximum, and I didn't make any bad choices it just truly was the situation. over my financial ability and so at least i've got that I know I did all the right things."
724.0,Provider,yeah I mean. You had a clear path right and then for whatever or multitude of reasons thing is it's just been roadblock after roadblock for you. This is housing illegal. or affiliated with it.
13019.0,Patient,"Oh, I did go at this past week there was another places they might be able to help me get into somewhere to where I wouldn't be spending money each week I could just go to work each day and stay there. And there's a place offered to me at turning point, but they told me, I had to go to some other place to register and to get. To get started with the process, but I got there and they were full they were completely full and that was disheartening they were like I was like well they told me they had a place for me that I could get in today, and they said, well, we can't give you the reference. Because it's so cool so."
724.0,Provider,"Well, who would give you a timeline for if they're going to be more openings in the future, or."
13019.0,Patient,"to know and some of these places, you know. I don't know how how safe they really are for for just anybody to be walking in the. area really fun and out and i've been living this life for a while, or. or their counselors there and i'm saying. there's like a middle ground I kind of stick out in some of these places, and that. That feels really. unsecure. know about them oh and that's Another thing I was going to say there is. there's shelter here that I was going to go to the Salvation Army just just to work and and you know, save up for my for my deposit and. Whenever over there and it's only for men, and so I said, you know what I said, is there not a women's shelter and there isn't. there's no drop in women's shelter, so you have to, I have to take off time from work or whatever i'm doing to actually go in and be assessed and that's what i'm going to do this next week to try to get started on that and. surprise me that there's a place for men, but there's not a drop in place for women, so I don't know what's going on with that."
724.0,Provider,"is strange. Oh. So sometimes they had where i'm at female shelters, but they weren't like public record. And you had to go through a referral source. And for us it was. It was crossroads um. So the is there a crossroads and there you."
13019.0,Patient,Probably i'm sure.
724.0,Provider,"I know how there's like like a handful of our. handful of like our other patients are in that group and that Tuesday group, our firm crossroads and I feel like maybe if you popped into one of those places they could give you. Maybe a list of potential options, where you could go, because those settings typically will have the. The round about the back door referral to women shelters and there's reasons why they're like hidden you know from public record and for good reason, so maybe following up with a crossroads why don't I look to see if there's one in La just save you the hassle."
13019.0,Patient,It crusher This is my Program.
724.0,Provider,"They do a bunch of stuff you know across or like I don't know what they do if they're if the same company right, but I know what they do in Rhode island where i'm at is like their temporary sheltering they have. worked for stuff that they kind of communicate with people there's volunteer work there's all kinds of like services that are like wrapped around with them, I don't know if i'm sure they're probably state funded to to a certain degree. But I think it's. It might be nationwide honestly so. crossroads. My computer's slow. crossroads recovery centers. there's a a wider California sound familiar."
13019.0,Patient,With whitner with anyone that's out.
724.0,Provider,"There is a la. habra California, it looks like it's an. la but."
13019.0,Patient,yeah Where are you.
724.0,Provider,Which one is closer i'm in Rhode island i'm on the east coast.
13019.0,Patient,"holy moly Okay, I thought, all of you close by me."
724.0,Provider,"You. Know i'm, on the other side of the country."
13019.0,Patient,"la habra and video, I think, video is closers. Okay. I could be wrong. I seen it on the. what's the weather like today."
724.0,Provider,It was actually kind of Nice try like like low 70s. Little overcast not bad. But it's definitely springtime the weather's changing pretty quickly around here.
13019.0,Patient,So it'd be.
724.0,Provider,it'll be cold kind of kind of cold in no time so we're busting out all the flannels and all the genes now.
13019.0,Patient,"I need to get. It does get I was surprised the one of the things that surprising about Los Angeles, and this area is that I didn't know how cold it again I knew it they had heaters, and some of their houses. But it gets down to. 40 degrees here, it can. So that was kind of surprised I know the sunshine a lot, but it can get kind of cold, but at least not below 40 you know I didn't want any really cold winters."
724.0,Provider,Right yeah yeah it's a it's a trip that's for sure.
13019.0,Patient,and I really feel like you've done all you can to find a place i'll look up i'll look into the the crossroads.
724.0,Provider,"yeah I got the information, right here for crossroads so. I put in there to something else that the other thing that I said, is the La county. government office housing in public housing, so that they might be two separate things. Okay, this the number for crossroads and then this is going to be the address for crossroads."
13019.0,Patient,I just i've got all of that there. yeah.
724.0,Provider,"So yeah So the first one is the housing authority. The first ones in. Housing services, the other ones that housing authority, then the third one in, there is the that's crossroads. So try to follow up with them and any any one of those and start start bang down doors and see what they what they recommend. And then we'll go from there. Okay. um any other issues or concerns other than these being like the big ones, these are primary issues."
13019.0,Patient,i'll save that for next. Our next.
724.0,Provider,"Alright well do some do some homework, when you get some free time before to to do some homework. i'll have care navs reach out to you to schedule a follow up, based on However, your schedule kind of pans out. we'll go from there okay."
13019.0,Patient,"That scheduling APP for work, but that's what i'm going to focus on next so."
