226.0,Provider,hey crystal. I hey how are you.
9071.0,Patient,"I think I was in your group one time, I think you covered for. Oh what's her name, she has blond hair to truly know not Julie."
226.0,Provider,"I yeah I did cover one group yeah is it with it on Wednesday. yeah yeah okay. All right, hey nice to see you."
9071.0,Patient,"Know sorry i'm late Oh, my goodness, I was running from another appointment sorry."
226.0,Provider,"that's okay i'm okay so were you working with Tara Tara. yeah okay. All right, so um. If you could just give me a little bit of background that that will help me so like as we work together. You know just. A little bit of background on yourself and then just some things that you and Tara we're working on."
9071.0,Patient,"um, so I am disabled I live with my parents um I don't really leave the House today is a very unusual day. Because I did have a couple of appointments when I have appointments I usually make a couple of them so that I make the most of the day. Because, after that i'm going to pay so try to do as much as I can, on these type of days um so that obviously plays into not like seeing people being social. Like nobody comes over to the House because it's not that type of environment, not because of me, but because my parents um and physically, to be able to go out to see anyone I used to be able to maybe like once or twice a month um but now it's like once or twice a year."
226.0,Provider,"So what i'm Okay, so you said you're disabled, can you give me a little bit of background on that."
9071.0,Patient,"So I have a radical scoliosis my spine is like that I did have spinal fusion surgery a couple of them, it turned into about 10 years ago um I was told if I didn't have it that I would die by the age of 40 because my spine would push into my lungs and hard and kill me. um I don't know if that would have really happened, but I do know that that surgery ruin my life. They said, like six months after you've had it oh like if you're on motoring that will be like a lot so um you know I I never would have thought that i'd still be at pretty much the same level of pain same level of pain killers as from day one to today. um so that's just kind of. flatlined my life and. And then there's I have all kinds of circling other things like sleep apnea asthma. Chronic migraines endometriosis and I have an adrenal disorder where basically my my adrenal don't produce cortisol which you know, as you know, is the stress hormone so just imagine that. I don't have I don't produce the stress hormones So how do I deal with all distress I don't I shut down, but I do take steroids, and I have been for. 13 years. So i'm been trying to figure that out i've been to all different universities, trying to figure that whole thing out still. Nowhere as far as i'm concerned i'm and. yeah I mean just like every type of pain, you can imagine i've got it."
226.0,Provider,"So. Alright, so. How do you cope with this stuff."
9071.0,Patient,"So that is a question chantelle asked me the first day. And then. Tara eventually asked me that as well, and I, my original answer was um I don't know. um and then I found out through a couple sessions with Tara she actually was the one who identify that one of the major ways I cope is sleep. Like if something traumatic happens there's like an argument or do something, whatever is traumatic um I will just like curl up mostly like I like I can't be awake like my body just literally shuts down like power off. So I guess that is one way I figured out that I that I do. That I cope, you know I don't like it um and then. I mean, I guess, I would just say like spiritually I cope um you know prayer. So and and like fellowship with my friends um I would say, those are like the main ways that i've realized that I cook but I obviously need a lot of help in that department."
226.0,Provider,So what what were some things that you and Tara we're working on.
9071.0,Patient,"um well let's see she was it is as well as this coping thing we were talking about self care. At the left of sessions we're talking about self care and she was asking me how do you self care or whatever, and I was like I don't I don't know because I literally did not know what that meant. um so she sent me a I have it over here, I think it was like a list of of ways, you can manage a waste to manage or ways to self care. um and we kind of went through went through them and figure out where I am like deficient and where I actually am doing pretty well um I can grab that if you want, if you want me to be specific."
226.0,Provider,"No that's okay um. So, since you guys went over self care, have you been able to focus on that a little bit more."
9071.0,Patient,"I would say i'm definitely much more aware now. um yeah yeah because I mean going from not even knowing what the heck it is. Like i'm doing stuff i'm like Oh, this is self care like you know i'm starting to even use the phrase now with friends so."
226.0,Provider,yeah okay. Do you feel. isolated.
9071.0,Patient,Oh yeah.
226.0,Provider,"So, but it's really, really difficult for you to get out and do anything now right, I mean it just doesn't. So what do you do all day."
9071.0,Patient,"Oh, I do I do um well like I. I do a lot of research um I like doing research. and talking to friends um even though. I gotta say the talking to friends thing is a pretty big guy big deal because I. I had been like very. I guess you could say isolated or isolating myself, maybe from friends, a lot over the last couple of years and then cove it happens. And ironically that's kind of when things you know got better and I started reaching out more or reaching back more because I had so many people reaching out to me all the time. And so I would just be like it, so in my head thinking about what I have to say and explain this and how like I don't have anything good to say so, why, why would I even reply, I would just pump them out. So all this stuff going is what would go through my head, and I would just like usually not even reply, a lot of the time. But like like Tara was saying, like you, don't owe anyone to explanation like they would just be happy if you just said hey how are you like don't even like answer. anything about how you are to say hey how are you, you know just turn it on them so that's even help just in the last couple of months."
226.0,Provider,"Okay, good all right."
9071.0,Patient,"And what else do I do, I mean i'm. I try to do as much as I can, like getting in getting up but it's all very like spring it. If that makes sense, like like i'll get up for like five minutes and try to like fold the clothes and try to do something like productive. But like I said last maybe five minutes and then it's like 30 minutes of recovery and massaging my muscles and stretching and exercise like just to recover from that and then do it all over again, and then all over again so that's kind of a lot of my day to. Right yeah."
226.0,Provider,"So we're kind of exercise, are you able to do."
9071.0,Patient,"um Well, I do have the bands, I do the bands and sometimes I do I do use the lightweights like the two pound weights nothing too heavy yourself myself, and then I do a lot of like I actually have a thing here. I have it right on my wall, so I can look at it every day. And if I don't I won't do it. You know, like a lot of like. Things that I can do, laying in bed. i'm actually. i'm laying in bed like you know the the knees up in the air and raising your butt up with it and stretch out the legs and just doing doing whatever I can with what I can."
226.0,Provider,"yeah Okay, so are you able to like take a walk."
9071.0,Patient,"Oh no I mean no not really I would love to and it's not it's, not because I don't want to um it's just the like even this right now me sitting up, for you know 2030 minutes oh my gosh it's going to kill me. um. Oh yeah oh gosh you know it's like it's like. Something is coming down and it's obtaining my body and like. collapsing in on me just steadily slowly, as every minute passes by so that's why normally actually I just had my brace on our own, I took it off oh i've sweaty um but, so I usually have a brace on our kind of helped me stay, you know, in the right posture and stay up a little longer. But yeah like the walking thing just anything being upright. Sitting walking standing standing is the worst um yeah it's it's it's just physically not not not right now right."
226.0,Provider,Do you spend most of the day lying on your back then.
9071.0,Patient,"um I wouldn't say it's lying on my back I used to um but I got an adjustable base. Yes, I could be in a reclining position. But the whole lying on the back thing is like you might as well just be. asleep all day like it'll just that position will just like talk me out like. that's what you're supposed to do when you're going to sleep, so I can't do that so once I realized that that's when I got the adjustable base so that I could at least be kind of up a little bit, but not. You know what I mean so but yeah that's normally where i'm at at of reclined position on my back."
226.0,Provider,So what medication is shauntel prescribing to you.
9071.0,Patient,So she is prescribing what my original psychiatrists was prescribing which is 60 milligrams of cymbalta twice a day and the booths was pyro goes from 15 milligrams twice a day as well and that's that's all and I say that's all because I feel like it's not enough.
226.0,Provider,Are you on any pain medication.
9071.0,Patient,"Oh yeah oh yeah for sure. Let me tell you what it is, or."
226.0,Provider,Who prescribes that.
9071.0,Patient,Oh that's my pain management doctor. yeah yeah.
226.0,Provider,Does it help.
9071.0,Patient,"It helps to the point where it's just bearable. yeah and then, if I miss it if I if I like sleeper dose or something, but you know, like hurry up like it's like 4045 minutes of hell like. don't move don't breathe like yeah so yeah just barely like I said just barely and then you get off track a little bit and it's like oh you're off the rooms."
226.0,Provider,yeah.
9071.0,Patient,yeah it's no no way to live.
226.0,Provider,"Any like suicidal ideation any. Okay, good. i'm. Great so as we work together what what would be helpful for you, what are some things you want to focus on."
9071.0,Patient,"Well, stupid question I, the first thing that came to mind when you asked. Was accountability. I feel like certain things I I can, if I can get away with it i'll do I will."
226.0,Provider,yeah.
9071.0,Patient,"You know, like oh i'll cave into my weaknesses and you know, like I don't say laziness but it's like my all came into my pain and my my sickness, you know what I mean. If I can but i'm doing things like up like waking up at the same time, every day i'm going to keep at the same time, every day, I have tried for probably two decades to do that, I cannot do it. So I feel like you know if I have someone like saying you know, are you doing this, you know someone to answer to. Because it's like I have my parents, but they're not they're not accountability type of people, I mean. They just let me just let me be and that it is what it is, I wish they would be more proactive in helping me but that's just not their jam so. um so yeah I mean that's just an example of like holding me accountable i'm sure there's a lot of things I could think of to have you helped me stay accountable for but that's, the first thing that came to mind."
226.0,Provider,"Okay. So do you think you want to have more want your days to be more structured, or do you just want to have be like learn to be accountable for certain things."
9071.0,Patient,"Oh. I want a more structured day I mean adventure, I feel like eventually, yes, but I think it's like baby steps to."
226.0,Provider,"yeah I agree totally because when you haven't really had to be accountable for a long period, like you said two decades, two decades that's a long time. So that that's definitely going to be baby steps in terms of like making making those changes right because it takes accountability, and you know it takes like discipline. And i'm sure there's days, where you just don't feel like it cuz you're in pain, you know you're paying level, it probably changes from like hour to hour sometimes."
9071.0,Patient,Oh yeah oh definitely mm hmm.
226.0,Provider,"yeah Okay, are you in the chronic pain group."
9071.0,Patient,"I had actually talked to with Tara about that yeah. And she said she said she was sending a note to tell, but I just never heard anything."
226.0,Provider,"Right, let me do this right now hold on, let me see if I can. make a note. Do you know what group you're in right now."
9071.0,Patient,The group is they meet on Wednesdays at 130. I don't know if they have a name.
226.0,Provider,Okay.
9071.0,Patient,"And I actually have a finally made an appointment, just like a one on one appointment with chantel it's on October 19. At said, Maria. You know, maybe she'll say something, then, or I could say something."
226.0,Provider,"yeah I think that, let me email her on this."
9071.0,Patient,So.
226.0,Provider,"And who said, who does the group at 130 on Wednesday."
9071.0,Patient,that's yeah Julie.
226.0,Provider,"shauntel. Right so. All right, so I just sent shontelle an email, and you guys can discuss it on the 19th. You know, it just might be something it might be something to consider just to give you a little bit added support it doesn't mean that you have to give up that Wednesday group. You know just means that that might be also a great addition to you know your your process here, you know your. recovery process. Okay. Because I know that they also in that group, you know they're going to talk about coping skills and coping strategies and what. You can also hear what other people do like you know, and you can hear it you're not alone it because it's so isolating how you are, you know, unfortunately, like it's just. The nature of what you have you know, the current the pain that you do with makes it really difficult to obviously. get up and out and about so um you know kind of being with people that are experiencing similar situations might be helpful."
9071.0,Patient,"yeah um my aunt she has a like a Facebook group for like people like us, she has similar situation me. And like i'm just not it's. Just it's just not I like I just don't look for it, I tried to you know be on it and interact, but it just I don't know i'd rather i'd rather like talk to people. kind of person I am yeah. I feel like that would. Hold me anyway."
226.0,Provider,yeah I know. you're out enjoying.
9071.0,Patient,Real yeah.
226.0,Provider,"Right. How can we meeting with Tara how many times, a month."

Until the group meeting thing becomes less because I can't like do everything like like I would like to do, once a week, you know for with you like, I wanted to do for but like it's just too much. yeah you're with so. But if. In kind of maneuver things you know, to get to a point that's like my goal is to get to once a week, but right now it's twice a week."
