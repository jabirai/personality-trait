740.0,Provider,You.
16417.0,Patient,not good.
740.0,Provider,"Oh, what happened."
16417.0,Patient,Man yesterday was last week was so nice and it just feels like it ended. How are you.
740.0,Provider,Listening to you.
16417.0,Patient,"So, on Monday so. I have been trying so anyways I went to the doctor, a few weeks ago."
740.0,Provider,To get.
16417.0,Patient,"My pap smear and my results came in and it turns out that I have this really interesting STI. And it's just been hard like this is probably like the most Communist i've been all week. It really broke me down and. Like my partner and I are like trying to figure it out, but we don't he says he didn't do anything I say I didn't do anything um. But the thing about the STI is that apparently men don't get when they get STI tested they don't get tested for this so there's no way of telling if another person if he if the mail has it. um. And then another thing is that the STI could be dormant in your body, and it can pop up within like years from then on out, which I think is really. weird. So. That day when the doctor told me I couldn't really process all of the information she was saying, but I made a follow up for next Friday to get more questions answered. And i've also been talking on the phone with a nurse who explained all of that to me as well. But it. Was i'm shocked shocked."
740.0,Provider,"A. Best best this definitely something that will throw you off to get my voice my throat hurts really bad, so I barely have I barely have one but. it's definitely something that will throw you off and that will take you for a loop, especially when there's a St. there and then, if both people are saying the same story adding do it, I didn't do it, and so. I guess the question would be. I mean in regards to that in regards to the is the is it is it gained through sexual trade do sexual transmission, you know how do you get it."
16417.0,Patient,"yeah apparently it's only gained through sexual transmission. With skin to skin contact. So i'm still really confused about because it says that. Like the nurse gave me websites to read and it says that it can be transmitted like from like either tongue kissing or anything further than that. But the thing is, is that it could also be dormant in your body and our pop up until whenever it feels like it. And then. And then it won't go in here it's supposed to heal on its own. With your body developing natural immunity to it or. Something to clear you from it. That it should clear within a year."
740.0,Provider,"hmm. So yeah they can definitely be frightening. Especially if it's too sexual transmission and then everybody's saying the same thing. So, then you don't know what to think. or. If you can trust was being safety."
16417.0,Patient,yeah.
740.0,Provider,Definitely sorry that you have to go through there. And it's pretty tough.
16417.0,Patient,yeah I don't know what to do.
740.0,Provider,Regarding regarding your relationship.
16417.0,Patient,"guardian, like everything like. Up until my relationship as well. Like I don't know if it was me I don't know if it was him like. Where I know that I missed up is that I did have other partners before him. But I like before him and I didn't get to sit until I was in a relationship with him, and so I didn't get tested after those partners. And when they did get tested, they were only through urine and apparently you can't detect that the only way you could detect it is through cervical pap smears but even through pap smears there you can it can be dormant, which is so confusing to being. But it could have I still. I still can't help it to wonder, it was could have been you prepping him."
740.0,Provider,As you say. So.
16417.0,Patient,"Now, when I was in a relationship. Now, while I have it."
740.0,Provider,"So. With the STI. is going to heal. Right. it's always. it's not an STD is a car. Right, which means that with immunity. And all the time to heal. However, you have to ask yourself the question. Since. I do get it is unknown. i'm sure you've had pap smears before right. and have they ever said anything like that, before that you have as."
16417.0,Patient,"Well that's where I also messed up because I haven't had a pap smear in about. Four years because i'm scared of them I was scared of them. And then get in habit at the time, but the symptoms that are being related to. To the STI are similar to what I have been feeling and I had been going to the doctor to get tested before, but I only would go to take like a urine test or they would tell me would be like a uti or something like that it was never diagnosed with that."
740.0,Provider,Until you have a pap smear How long have you been with this guy.
16417.0,Patient,So i've been with him for six years.
740.0,Provider,"Okay, so basically and has there been any indiscretions."
16417.0,Patient,"No, not to my knowledge. But how will I ever no."
740.0,Provider,No.
16417.0,Patient,It was me.
740.0,Provider,How would you even kissing.
16417.0,Patient,Well that's what i'm saying like.
740.0,Provider,indiscretions.
16417.0,Patient,"No, but I had previous partners that I was in that I didn't get tested afterwards."
740.0,Provider,"there's a possibility, especially they said that is an incurable infection and it POPs back up. So I mean if he said that is not him."
16417.0,Patient,I don't know.
740.0,Provider,When you say it's not you. know.
16417.0,Patient,"I don't know. At this point, i'm not denying that it's possible, it could be me but i'm also not closing the door on the possibility that could also be him. could also have been him."
740.0,Provider,"So now, how does it, how does it affect your relationship moving forward."
16417.0,Patient,"that's what we're. we're trying to figure out, I guess, I don't know I really don't know i'm just like so shocked. I don't know i've never been through any like this war."
740.0,Provider,is definitely one of those things. To where. You have to decide. You know it's one of those things to wear our site that you to. Take your time and that you don't have to jump to any conclusions. or any assumptions. Because this is the thing. That you have is all right right because it's not a disease which means they can heal. Right. In the boys of the movie on Saturday.
16417.0,Patient,I was before I knew.
740.0,Provider,Okay. found out about this.
16417.0,Patient,On Monday.
740.0,Provider,This Monday.
16417.0,Patient,"When I went back to. I didn't even I went back to get my hands check, because since i've been working over the computer I developed a lot of hand wrist problems i've been going to physical therapy as well for my wrists. But then they told me that I actually had some results about pap smear too, so they told me that, if anything, came up that they would call me. But if. They didn't hear from me, they are going to hear from them, then I was good, I hadn't heard from them in three weeks there were supposed call me into, and so, then I just showed up there just to get my wrist checked and, on top of that, they told me. That I really sharp."
740.0,Provider,"Imagine what you're feeling is valid right if anybody will do a color news definitely be like oh my gosh where's this coming from. I think. You should look more into the websites that the doctor gave you so you can gain information of how transmission. I mean, how far she could go right so more so, of how far back. It can go and how often it can reoccur, it is a fresh transmission, or is it something. Or is this something that took place, you know previously like you know i'm saying it's just based off of right based off of research and information, and if you ever have any questions. Then you know i'm saying get off the phone and call your doctor to get more information about that you know i'm saying. in regards to your relationship. You don't know. You don't want to have some. insane and soldiers is what it is. Until you find out otherwise. Unless you feel like you can't live with it, and that you got to get out. And so really and truly best your choice. yeah that's basically you have a choice I made in a record I can't sway you on a choice, neither neither what I try to make it for you, but."
16417.0,Patient,"I have an appointment next Friday and i'm just writing down a lot of questions questions that are coming up. And i'm hoping to get. information. About what's next, because I know the main thing is that i'm going to be abstinent for the next year, but if i'm living with someone who also has it are we transferring it back and forth in other ways as well."
740.0,Provider,So that the plan is for you to be abstinent for the next year.
16417.0,Patient,yeah.
740.0,Provider,And what did he say about that.
16417.0,Patient,"He said yeah. he's so he. He said he never did anything and like anything but anyone else during our relationship. And he is also gone to get like like as a relationship thing like. What we do is I will go get tested together, and you know we'll come back we'll share results it it's not it was in it's not a big deal but it's not detected in men like you're not they're not being tested for that So how will they ever know if they're spreading it. um so when he comes back clean he doesn't come back with that with test for that, so we don't know. But he's just told me that he's only had two partners me and another person and he's always stood by that story. um and that he we had broken up once before, and that he was absent, the whole time, but he was absent and he said he was absolutely because you know, he was also depressed and that's not his start that that's not His style. um i've never. had any issues with him about. i've never felt insecure with him about. You know cheating other women or other people i'd like. In my intuition like I or my how I feel like I don't have never felt like that about him. And he's just been on this point or he's saying that you know huge like I didn't want to talk to him about it, I On Monday I came home and I close the door in the bedroom and it locked it never came out. And he's been sleeping on the couch when they into state. And then he's just like knocks on the door, he says or he'll text me like whenever you're ready to talk i'm right here, and then like we talked about it, but I can't have. A long conversation with him, because I feel like I get really nauseous and dizzy and I just want to leave, but he was just telling me that, like he didn't do anything, and you know what is it that we need to do to cure this and, like. You know, he had that I also have to understand that he didn't do anything and now he's experiencing the same thing to that he's just finding out that he has an STI to. And so he's has an STI he says he sleeping on the couch and he didn't do anything but just be like monogamous in the relationship and that he's like. You know what is it that we need to do like what is it that I have to do to do it like he told me like I don't mind being abstinent for a year if that's what's going to help cure us but. If, like you, what is it that's gonna. Like what is that what's going to help, we need to either will work this out or figure something out like. Like it feels like he just wants to be where my side, but I don't know. If with intentions are coming from. I don't know. I just feel so overwhelmed. Like."
740.0,Provider,Before this did you trust him.
16417.0,Patient,yeah I did.
740.0,Provider,Did you ever did you ever suspect him to lie to you over the six year shopping together.
16417.0,Patient,"When I would suspect them to lie to me they were like. Like white lies that I would always like. Not even white lies, but like. Like there's little things that you. Like maybe things that he doesn't tell me like like living with him, I found out he senses my money or. His his full backstory like I just feel like i've gotten to know him much more. But I don't. I don't see this, I want to trust him, but I also want to do the right thing for me. Now I don't know what that is."
740.0,Provider,takes time. Absolutely with you. And he's willing to sleep on the couch. he's going to do with it really is the teacher asked him to do. Just to prove to you that.
16417.0,Patient,"he's. I feel she's always been like that, though, like. When my head, since even before my hands were injured like he'll get home early she'll start cleaning like you're washing dishes because my hands have been injured or even like when we were younger like. Like you would wake up, sometimes, and you know, giving you rights to school, like all the way to northridge like he's always. done a lot for me. And that's just not something that. that's why I would. Like. I can't even think of the things that he's done for me right now, but he is done a lot and I don't. I don't know. I still don't know. I don't know what to believe. Then, what if it was me like what if I transfer this to. Should I expect him to forgive me, too."
740.0,Provider,"Well that's a good question. Because considering this she said is not curable and then it pops up. I mean what you want, you want the man to take a lot of dictates."
16417.0,Patient,"He told me, and I said i'm not paying for that, like i'm not gonna waste my money, just to go out of my way free me to find out. yeah like. or. I guess."
740.0,Provider,"So one thing that would say like I say. You gotta do your research. What some some of these some of these St as they can't you can't you can't get cured. herpes is one of them. Right is is the incurable so yeah. And the thing about it is, is there is one of those things that pops up out of the blue, especially we're immune system is compromised. The public or there's something that you show Kuwait, but things like that you know Al come up people call them like cleaver favorite blisters and sometimes they can be fever blister sometimes they can be assigned that herbie just. Coming back you know i'm saying it is one of those things, but what I will say. They you know i'm saying either is fresh you don't know you don't know you don't know this fresh from you. Or you don't know if it's the past from you, you don't know this fresh from him, you don't know get the past from him. No, no. So you telling me that you went in a butcher relationship on the line. for something that you don't know."
16417.0,Patient,Like.
740.0,Provider,If you didn't pay for the days and hams egg allowed to take this and you can tell. me.
16417.0,Patient,Which is scared like. If this is forgiven what is something worse happens.
740.0,Provider,"Oh, my gosh here we go. Now, oh my God Oh, here it is here we go, what about the game, you have it is the maybe this can let him know that he can do other stuff too, but they're the same time you ain't got no proof, there is a. Here we go, we are, we are already down it's one it's wonderful. If I do this, it was something else, what or what, if nothing else happens because he didn't do anything. You don't know."
16417.0,Patient,You have a point.
740.0,Provider,"My thing is this. At the end of the day, yeah just split the price split the price that a lot of a taste and ego ego take it's 11 will take. So can put your put your. Certain give you the answer that you want, so that you can either move on with our relationship or jack and separate. And then upon would you run back and forth back and forth back and forth. be in trouble in being anxious and making yourself cell phone not again stuff i'm like at the end of the day. girl sort of thing. Is ways to get resolved to get this resolved. And then, even if he passes, if you still don't want to do, then, if you want to step away from the initial this. would have some data road now we're not going to go, what if something down the road, because you can improve you. say where you can improve this. So right now we're just going based off of assumptions. So, the best thing to do is to get accurate information. And if he's willing to take the test. And, but for will pay for it."
16417.0,Patient,My anxiety has been through the roof this this past is.
740.0,Provider,"I mean it's to be expected. I mean look at this situation that just happen. That means these the motion that you have fits the situation. And with you know, knowing it will continue to go through the roof. Because you can be worried about it all the time, not going to be able to shake it and have a very good option. is to be expected, you look you got some very devastating news. whoa. Oh sorry i've been i've been battling so bit, but. I didn't want to take off. No. But um. But yeah, so this is what I will say I mean i'm trying to keep things into perspective. don't run into 2023 to 2024. No don't ponder on what is, in our kind of stuff now. If he's willing to do it, let them pay for the taste, let him take it if he passes the initial choice whether or not you can stay If he fails dentistry you choose whether or not you can start. So i'm gonna give you a pass this week. Are you fulfilling your obligation and making sure you go out with your friends."
16417.0,Patient,And then we had purchased. Before so this weekend was so nice and then we had even. purchased an airbnb for. joshua tree. But it's just so sad.
740.0,Provider,Was.
16417.0,Patient,Because we both have in this ti.
740.0,Provider,We can enjoy.
16417.0,Patient,It just It just seems. think you can I don't know how that makes it sound Thank you enjoy yourself.
740.0,Provider,I mean it's a moment for you all to be able to talk. i'm saying a moment to be able to. Just be speak to each other and to give in to give you all some some some space that's why I say it is best to get the lie detector test done before you go.
16417.0,Patient,"We have like today, tomorrow."
740.0,Provider,Where are you very good today. We get off the line. When I go ahead. My thing is is i'm gonna tell you something and i'll be honest with you. If you love him enough. You can work through anything. And that's the god honest truth. If he loves you enough. Then he'll he'll stick with you do anything. If you. If. If he's committed and you're committed. Then you can make it through anything.
16417.0,Patient,"How do you love a partner, without like. Not. Disregarding yourself."
740.0,Provider,What do you mean.
16417.0,Patient,"Like. They can point us to you. Like. there's like if. Yes, I love him. But at what point. Do I love him. Do I know that i'm not no longer. loving myself like i'm putting him before me. Like how do I know when i'm doing that."
740.0,Provider,"It is definitely one of those things, and if you feel it, I think it is more so based off of. Based off of. Based off of if you feel like that you are giving everything but you're not taking care of yourself. Like if you don't feel like. They. If you don't feel like that you are. taking care of yourself and your own emotions and that you're putting your stuff to the side, for the sake of somebody else being yeah. So just take time and just kind of figure it out, but if he's willing to pay for it and take it take it."
16417.0,Patient,And i'm also like I know for a fact we're going to be absent in either way so.
740.0,Provider,Right so.
16417.0,Patient,Whatever happens. it's going to be solely on whoever.
740.0,Provider,Does it.
16417.0,Patient,"And I know that i'm. taking care of myself because i'm going to the doctor going to therapy i'm working on. Other things as well. So i'm not. gonna stop taking care of myself. and Since he volunteered. The test. can look into it. I can look into it too. They think i'm. When I go next Friday like i'll have a better understanding. or other questions that I have about this STI with the doctor answered. I guess it's just doing like a plan of action to care. They also hadn't gone to get a pap smear either. So. They will also have some seeing some mild symptoms during the years and. I always thought I would get I would always start other things like Oh, if I drink too much coffee gives me a uti or something like that, but it it really like I feel like well, I would still have to ask Dr but. I feel like I have some closure. On knowing what it is that I have been experiencing."
740.0,Provider,yeah. So do that and let me know I go so we'll just follow up next week.
