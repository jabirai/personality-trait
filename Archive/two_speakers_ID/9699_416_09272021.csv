416.0,Provider,My husband's money your money.
9699.0,Patient,"All all you really did was to have money to run on and do whatever the kids wanted to do. Because he paid all the bills he'd never made me him he never made me pay a bill, not less, you know he wanted something that we can keep like he'll say hey you played a lot bill or something like that and that usually I mean. Thank God, I had money put up because I never really paid bills, so I got money in my little nest egg so i'm just going to be eager to get back to work, though, because i'm not one to sit at home, I rearranged my whole House. And i've cleaned all day today. My house is nothing clean. And there's my kid glommed on a gallery down."

416.0,Provider,yeah I mean you've always like since I met you there's there's been a lot of like. A dancing around your work for sure you know. huh yeah.
9699.0,Patient,"yep. yep i'm uh. i'm very upset more than anything, because. I work so hard to get where I was. So why."
416.0,Provider,"yeah yeah exactly. So. I mean. We can turn it into anger, we can turn it into sadness, but it's probably a mix of a lot of different things i'm guessing."
9699.0,Patient,"yeah more than well you know it's crazy I didn't know really how stressed, I was there until. I had no care no worries besides my kids now I never knew. Because I would come home angry snap enough kids like I didn't need to be, and I mean my attitude is turn into a whole one at. Because I had so much on my plate I done everything and then scheduling I done if they may call it in our word dummy not done i've been so much stuff. i've done everything I could to get where I was a wonder learn everything I that's even why we went to get my CDs because there being any kind of manager, you have to hold a cdn where you can cover if somebody calls out. You know that's why I even went from team leader manager, because I was getting I had my cto I my cto permanently nobody else did and now. I talked to everybody at work so call me and text is me they're not I got woke up at 2am ricky said i'm so sorry to call you, but I need to ask you a question. And I answered it, I was like that's fine you know you do this, you do that, you know that's a double stack whatever and they just don't realize still may not even work in there, I still care. that's just crazy i'm not crazy i'm not crazy. i'm crazy."
416.0,Provider,"you're not crazy. So. i'm. Let me see. I think it's important kind of ticket you help you move through this because right like this sort of. it's gonna it's gonna weigh you down a little bit right the sort of negative feelings about all of that. i'm trying to think I mean it might just stay by just sort of fade with time, and especially kind of as you move on, you might find that you don't you don't need that quite as much but. Trying to think of maybe some ways that you could get a little bit of closure with that situation. I don't know, do you have any ideas."
9699.0,Patient,"Well, I talked to an attorney also and the way they've done it they gave me some of arrays so they done it legally barely. So there's nothing the state of Tennessee I mean they've got to be bullying you. I don't know why cuz they would have fired me or something, then yeah I would have grounds to sue but it's it's a very thing to me, honestly, he said you'd probably be wasting your money because you have nothing to paint you have no proof. Because this was a verbal I had hadn't signed my papers yet. So it was a verbal at the time, I did it for two weeks I don't know why I didn't think hey I need my. I mean my letter you know, which are all for me where I could sonic because every time you you moved up there, do they give you an offer and letter. And you signed it, you know, agreed to this, you know terms or whatever pay was salary salary whatever, but I was so busy that those two weeks I didn't even think about a doula it's my own fault, you know I should have been that day hey I want this letter right now. So. It is what."
416.0,Provider,"It comes back to that. That sign I think i've told you this before, but there's that sign that's on the horse ranch that we go to my family goes to and as you're driving in it sign outside, but I always think about that says, sometimes you win and sometimes you learn."
9699.0,Patient,"Well, I have let me tell you I definitely have learned. yeah you couldn't you couldn't have possibly known before this right. I should, a new, positive because they because they kind of missed me over well, it was a misunderstanding, the first time something happened. And I should have everybody told me that's been there for years, you know hey you better watch on blah blah, and they had always been so good, to me, you know, I was so shocked doing you don't understand how. They paid me when I was out my daughter recovered, I mean they didn't have to, but they did, and I mean they were just so good to me to can stand, you know I got bonuses every three months off. Training bonuses, because I trained everybody walk to the door if they stayed longer than you know so many days and what's crazy that people are trained are still there. and I still talk to them, I still help them through you know they have they have a question they don't want to call the balls feel like feel stupid, I guess, because rick's just that kind of person that he be littles you if you know what I mean. I don't know, but I have work like I told my husband, I said I said, you know I said and lakes, it makes me feel good by helping somebody. You know and and i've told you know people that I train I said i'm not bad, an alternate people they're like what I done wrong I was like yeah they did I said, but what has been learning, you know learning to you. don't ever don't ever take. The position not unless you have that paper in your hand and you are fun. and I was so shocked I just couldn't believe it honestly. I was just like are you serious you want to let a good worker that's never missed a day, not less, I one time I missed was when my kid was sick with Colin I didn't perfect attendance before coven yes. I mean. it's just crazy. it's."
416.0,Provider,it's a huge betrayal.
9699.0,Patient,"It is and i'll probably never dressed another employer, you know they're always oh we're family orientated we're a small company, you know we have each other's back i've got your back, they have my back at all."
416.0,Provider,"No, no, it didn't and. I feel like that kind of anger. If it sticks around for too long, can kind of can hurt you more than it hurts them right."
9699.0,Patient,"Right, so the best thing was for me to walk away. think so because the anger, the anger, I had that day when I came I didn't want to feel the anger, no more I had to I took me two hours to get home, I had a pulled over at a food city park lot and I cried and cried and I yelled at myself I cried some more and then also on I came home."
416.0,Provider,"good for you, you got it out. I just didn't want to you're focusing on the lessons that you learned through this."
9699.0,Patient,Okay def not beating yourself.
416.0,Provider,Up I hopefully over what you couldn't have possibly known before.
9699.0,Patient,"Oh no oh no this ain't my fault, you know i've done everything I could I mean besides, besides the whole letter thing. it's their last game. Absolutely, they really care about me that if they did they would have done it to me to begin with, so i'm not letting i'm not let this hold me back or. Get that's what my husband was very big but tiffany don't get this depressed I don't want you to press we'll get through this you know, I was like i'm good i'm fine if you were told me this you know four or five years ago I probably them like haha be honest with you. But I mean i've learned how to deal with these triggers and it's not easy, of course. and minuses still I my mind, you know, like you were talking to a group of whenever I was in their last. About triggers and will cause them, and you know, keep your mind occupied and minds always I was always at work, even I mean I took my time from our group, you know, but I was at work, when I was doing my group, you know and. that's what. that's what really got me the past two weeks, I was like you all to my group, for me, I had to reschedule because I was driving those days, and then this happens to me. You can't do that to an addict you cannot do that. I was like Let this be a learning lesson."
416.0,Provider,that's right. yeah bad move. But you didn't let it pull you down.
9699.0,Patient,"Oh yeah I I immediately started researching about getting school done I got it actually the State actually paid for most of it, I got attrition and my fastball and all that crap. They they're going to be paying for most of it, and hopefully to God and they're going to try to get me in sooner class in November.

416.0,Provider,you've always been a. Go big or go home kind of person hmm. ever do you think you get that from.
9699.0,Patient,"Probably my dad my dad he is he is probably he's 58 he's had he's had neck surgery three times, he broke it in a car accident twice. And that man still gets up and he goes to work every single day, yes yeah. Every single day. He just don't give up. at all. He stayed off, I think, for like maybe two months after this last one, but then he was right back to work. I was like dad you cannot do because me and my husband were actually you know help pay the bills and knew we had to do to keep him from working. It was like nope can't do this, no more he says, I don't like asking for nobody nothing I like I said dad you don't owe me nothing i'm your daughters. You have helped me how many years, I mean you helped me through my years through my diction I mean he was my enabler because he always gave me money or whatever, but he was always there for me that's how i'm he didn't know what I was doing with it, but. You know. But yeah yeah my dad for sure my mom's always been a stay at home mom so I have to get for my Daddy she's kind of lazy. lover."
416.0,Provider,"And the thing about you that i'm noticing this not just that you, you do that go big or go home thing but but but it's like I worry about that usually a therapist because it's almost compulsive right it's like I can't stand to sit still but I don't see you doing the. I don't see you doing the thing where. Where you don't stop to."
9699.0,Patient,That was weird. There you go I can hear you now.
416.0,Provider,"my microphone just decided to die hold on, let me see if I can connect it again."
9699.0,Patient,either.
416.0,Provider,Maybe.
9699.0,Patient,"Yes, you're there you're there you're good."
416.0,Provider,"I was saying that it's. Like it's just really it's cool actually because. I worry so much about folks whose trauma response also there go to his go go go go go go go because it typically means that you're running away from your feelings that you're avoiding. But I don't always see that in you and I don't know, maybe that maybe that was true initially like maybe that's that was you a long time ago. But, like the fact that you stopped you cried you know that you've really been able to kind of honor your feelings about this and doesn't it doesn't indicate to me that you're running away, it seems like."
9699.0,Patient,"you're you're still moving on. yeah i'm moving on one step at a time. and My thing was really healthy. It is the vice versa, if I know me probably would have stayed and work through I mean just, no matter what it done to me I probably would have stayed there. Due to i've always. i've always worked working is my passion and. Robert finally learned me to grow up and have a backbone for ourselves in a healthy way. So therefore is me being able to stand up to them and say hey, this is it, this is you're not abusing me no more i'm done you're not making me feel like i'm crazy I know exactly what you told me what you said what you offered. No i'm not doing this. If you can't even own up to tell me, yes, I did say that, then I don't I don't i'm not year. i'm very truthful i'm a kind of person I try not to hurt nobody's feelings, but then again, I have no filter I try to but I speak my mind, instead of sugarcoating something even when my kids you know. I don't sugarcoat I am honest with him, you know what the world is out there right now. I don't act like it's you know all happy dandy. You know, and I told him I was like I wish you all were born, you know back in my day. Did I know the world was going to be to where I was right now and lock, it is right now there's no way of ranking in the world are no way in heck. crazy people going on strike people you know the whole people that passed away, you know overseas 13 soldiers, one of them was actually from my hometown here. I didn't know him but. You know my. My step son he's leaving. And another big thing about this whole everything that's happened. I haven't had no time for my step son and he's leaving he's going overseas next month, and the way this world is today it's very scary."
416.0,Provider,it's.

Is a seller. navy there you go. yeah he's in the navy see my husband, he was in the army, my husband's father was in the air force and his grandpa was in the national guard's and objects in the navy so they've all for been in different services that they've all started. So i'm just very i'm very worried about leaving he just had a little boy he just got married my grandson he is five months old. So."
416.0,Provider,"it's where so wait, did you say where he's going."
9699.0,Patient,It starts with a be it's not beggary but something like that. Is it going to hurt. it's actually write out the rot facade of Libya Libya Libya. Syria sorry Syria. Its closest the closest serious serious siri siri or whatever it is.

416.0,Provider,"orange and Saudi Arabia, so that is very close."

There pensacola so."
416.0,Provider,"So there's like there's a lot of downsides to all of this, but there it seems like there's also some upsides and you're working really hard to make the best of it like you said step. up right."
9699.0,Patient,"Yes, and I am it's it's been rough you know, because the work thing and then, as it gets deployed and it's just been like bang bang and i'm like gosh what's going to happen next, my, as did not say that."
