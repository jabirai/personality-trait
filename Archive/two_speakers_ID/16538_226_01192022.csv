Okay, it just like initially you know just like getting started. Okay, so you're on the suboxone Is that correct. yeah okay and that's working no side effects."
16538.0,Patient,No actually I have on yeah I had very bad side effects but um I don't know it's weird because when when I think it was maybe a day after or two when we saw each other.

226.0,Provider,Does she know you're on suboxone. Because it might show up on the test test or suboxone.
16538.0,Patient,How long how long. In your system it's been two weeks since I took in them.
226.0,Provider,"Well, it was boxing will just be it could show up on the top, so you need to know that. Okay, so I would have a conversation with her about it and just let her know that. you're in this program that you are prescribed suboxone. Okay, does that can be a problem."
16538.0,Patient,"yeah because i'm the accusations that were on the accusations just happened recently. But it was due to you know family member being in revenue or whatever, but anyways it's it hasn't been like improving so. that's why I got clean, so that I could drug test, and then it was just a rumor."
226.0,Provider,"Well, it was it was from map right that's what they were accusing you of yes."
16538.0,Patient,"that's what they're accusing me. Because I do have a history of it, the best show on my record."
226.0,Provider,Talk to a therapist that do CFS therapist and see what she says.
16538.0,Patient,I do have an agreement with her next week.
226.0,Provider,"Okay, you know I just you just want to be honest with her and just explain like hey look good you know. This is her precautionary measures you know it's. So I can stay clean, and so I can keep my life on track, I can get my kids back. This isn't this is prescribed now."
16538.0,Patient,It doesn't have to necessarily be because I was using. It could just be okay.
226.0,Provider,"yeah absolutely you can just say work, you know. For preventative like so I don't slip back i'm under a lot of stress now i'm learning how to how to implement coping strategies. Making changes in my life and i'm putting a lot of this stuff behind me and my focus is my. Mental emotional physical health and getting my children back."
16538.0,Patient,"Okay, yes."
226.0,Provider,"Okay, so let's do this today, I want to talk about the short term and long term goals and treatment ongoing cycle. Recovery related goals and. So, can you think of. Three short term goals that you want to work on, as we, as we meet and as you're in this program."
16538.0,Patient,"short term goals, would be. would be my communication."
226.0,Provider,better communication.
16538.0,Patient,Patients.
226.0,Provider,"So, with the communication, how do you want to be able to communicate better."
16538.0,Patient,"type that like I assume too much like us real quick to just assume negativity. and When I think about it, and then I just negativity just comes out my mouth. And it could be with anybody, it could be, in general, not necessarily just for kids, but it could be, you know with other people as well, I assume the worst, and so it just has a very huge negativity on me."
226.0,Provider,So when somebody says something to them what happens like can be named example.
16538.0,Patient,"yeah so somebody could be like oh i'm giving me their their. Their. way of how I am like the kids will be explaining like all you do this and I get very offensive I get very you know, trying to like pointed back at them, I know, but you do you know, and so it becomes very yes."
226.0,Provider,"So you get defensive and instead of being able to listen to that person is saying you start pointing and go right back at them saying this is what you do. yeah and okay so better communication, where you want to learn how to. Listen. To what is being said. Without becoming defensive. Okay, and the other one was patience."
16538.0,Patient,I like the little things get to eat.
226.0,Provider,things get to. What are the little things.
16538.0,Patient,"It could be anything to be honest, on. You know, a goal from from somebody. Making a face. And it's not even like intentional or a purpose like i'm assuming we're thinking about it it's like you know they're doing it towards me. And I just allow it to affect my mood my day."
226.0,Provider,Okay.
16538.0,Patient,know you can take them.
226.0,Provider,"So. what's the communication style that you have to feel like this has been with you for a long time or do another one that started, where you would get really, really would come to them."
16538.0,Patient,it's it it started. It started with my ex actually.
226.0,Provider,So the your ex me just for what correct.
16538.0,Patient,yeah my my abuser.
226.0,Provider,The abuser okay. Okay.
16538.0,Patient,"I mean I can't I can't I can't remember the last time I was it like this, foot from like you know family members who know me and my friends, they told me that you know I will I wasn't like this little such a happy, you know person so opening to. Lisa I have changed a lot."
226.0,Provider,"So abusers can do that right users. It takes a toll on you. yeah mentally emotionally physically, obviously it can take a toll on you to figure you're always on hyper alert you know you're hyper vigilant you're always waiting for the other shoe to drop you know you waiting for. You know something to happen. yeah you know you're always on guard documentation yep."
16538.0,Patient,"all the time. And I thought I thought it would only be with him, but like even now that he's not in the picture I see myself, which is everybody. Who, I am now."
226.0,Provider,"yeah so it takes a little bit of time, it can go away, but it it, how long were you with him again on."
16538.0,Patient,on and off I go with him since 2012.
226.0,Provider,"take some time right. The change that. You know the key is to not get in back in relationships with them and it doesn't sound like vcs is going to want that to happen, or you don't contribute back."
16538.0,Patient,I don't want that to happen.
226.0,Provider,"Okay. All right, what about it long term goals completed anyone."
16538.0,Patient,"Long term on I can long term, I just want to get back to a point in my life, where. I was happy and. I want to like have career. I want to be able to. To financially and mentally be independent. I want to be able to have a home. In an apartment or at the actual home, and I want to be able to long term, I provide for my kids on in any way that they would need me."
226.0,Provider,"So first things first is when you want to make sure that you're staying on the medication and you're taking the medication consistently as prescribed. Because that's going to help you stay clean, so what you don't want to do is get freaked out go off the medication, so you can test and then run the risk of having a relapse. Okay Okay, so your focus is to not relapse because if you relapse that is going to put you farther back. In terms of getting the kids. You know, to get reunification. I mean, have you gone through this before with them where you've had to test and. You know."
16538.0,Patient,"This is the first time that my kids have been removed from my care they were involved in the past, the first time that social services were involved was back in 2018 I was pregnant with my youngest kid and on. The surface got involved, because you know because of the abuse, but I work with them, so the social worker told me, you know put a restraining order and in 30 days i'll close the investigation that's as. far as it went."
226.0,Provider,"Right, so this time. There was a little bit more involved in right like where they. You know, because."
16538.0,Patient,There was a lot of police reports in this address. In the violence comic con more series.
226.0,Provider,So was the violence toward directed towards you or the kids are both.
16538.0,Patient,"It was it was more towards me but. Should I say my my ex and he wasn't the father of my first child, you know at first in the beginning, I thought, like Okay, he hasn't been against my kid but then. My ex has two kids from a previous relationship, and they would come visit on the weekends, and I will see how he would talk to them, and it was like it was disgusting. It was very verbally abusive. What i'm a was mostly like me."
226.0,Provider,"yeah Okay, so the police reports were filed by you, the crack."
16538.0,Patient,"yeah. The issue was that he just he would leave with the he would come back so that was the issue is that he would always just come back into the House, and so it was it was more so, like on. I wasn't taking the necessary steps to to protect me in the kids from the kids in another domestic violence incident."
226.0,Provider,How many police reports per file.
16538.0,Patient,At this address in general.
226.0,Provider,At this address.
16538.0,Patient,I want to say goodbye eight.
226.0,Provider,"And then, what about like what would you say total how many police report sleeping in. coto just curious."
16538.0,Patient,I don't.
226.0,Provider,"yeah yeah. that's why you have an open investigation. So. Okay, so how are you feeling like a turn bettering showing a little bit more positive a little bit more hopeful."
16538.0,Patient,"i'm since i'm. Using I feel more. I mean, I have my moments, where I feel down."
226.0,Provider,yeah.
16538.0,Patient,"And i'm not gonna lie there's times, where I felt like this is my life i'm just going to be without my kids because i've been up going without them for like know almost going on a year. And it isn't I can envision it because it's just something that I got used to. yeah, but I am still doing what I need to do. I haven't slept off on that and making sure that i'm keeping up with appointments and my presentations. yeah so I guess a part of me the downside is most helpful."
226.0,Provider,"yeah so but Okay, so are they you're going for reunification Is that correct."
16538.0,Patient,"it's just i'm supposed to be going for reunification ages my case hasn't moved forward, because my ex not my abuser my ex. He signed a petition say that he wanted to be a part of it. But he's in prison."
226.0,Provider,that's right.
16538.0,Patient,yeah so he can't he needs to be there in order for the judge to continue it.
226.0,Provider,Can you get off that I mean. Like I asked her any way around.
16538.0,Patient,"I asked my attorney my attorney so that there is a paper saying that he could sign saying that he doesn't want to be a part of it, but social worker or his attorney has to send it to him. I don't I don't know."
226.0,Provider,"Whereas, whereas the landscape, where."
16538.0,Patient,He is. I forgot. Oh hi desert desert state prison.
226.0,Provider,"Okay, how how long is it going to be in there."
16538.0,Patient,he's supposed to be getting released next year.
226.0,Provider,"yeah so you don't want to strike down another year that's what's going to happen, exactly, I mean that makes no sense at all."
16538.0,Patient,"And then I had also Washington attorney if the judges allowed to just keep continuing the Court dates like if there's. A time limit, or something and the Attorney said no, but unfortunately because there's a paper saying that Mr you know Medina my ex wife wants to be a part of it, that the judge can has to actually just keep continuing until he's present."
226.0,Provider,"You have contact with them, are you able to."
16538.0,Patient,"yeah I i've spoken to him, maybe once or twice since all of this has happened, the last time we spoke, he said that you know. Every time he gets the papers for the Court dates. it's an actor, the Court date."
226.0,Provider,"But, can you tell him explain to him what's happening, and can you ask him to just sign off on it, is there any way that. I did I."
16538.0,Patient,"did ask, I asked him if he could get the paper to sign it, he said that he asked one of the deputies there if he can get in contact with his attorney. which he didn't know he had an attorney, by the way, but the deputies there had told him that his attorney needs to be some human that paperwork. it's like they're not giving him much options in there. And then I can't I can't do it my lawyer told me that he couldn't send the paper on my behalf, it has to be on on their behalf, like on that slide. yeah."
226.0,Provider,When you ask your attorney to get a hold of his attorney and just explain this.
16538.0,Patient,I could try that yeah I haven't I haven't tried that.
226.0,Provider,"Just try that and see what happens. And then, if you can get Ahold of your acts in there and just say hey here's what my what i'm doing. Just like NASA can you make sure that you sign off on this. device, this could go on and on and on."
16538.0,Patient,"yeah I mean he agreed he seemed await me and him we talked he agreed, he said that you know. I my son Isaiah he needs to be with me, you know traveling with their mother well, so he told me he was like, if I could get that paper i'll sign off on it music on another letter D a big deal. He said um it's just more so getting that paper or how to go about it about getting it but um so yeah I actually my son talks to him. I don't know how often that they talk often. Okay yeah and I always like you know I always tell the mom like you know, on the call me or."
226.0,Provider,Okay. And what's up in prison for.
16538.0,Patient,"That I don't know to be honest, there was rumors when he got incarcerated in the beginning, you know we didn't have contact. Because we just weren't in a good place at the time, but there were rumors that it was a house robbery that went wrong and there was another woman that was multiple house robberies yeah."
226.0,Provider,"Right. Okay, so anything else, that you have any concerns about or that you want to go home."
16538.0,Patient,i'm at the moment no. I feel like i'm on a positive. yeah okay.
226.0,Provider,"But let's keep taking that medication. i've had the conversation with your other therapist is to explain. what's going on, she do you feel like she's on your side, no actually."
16538.0,Patient,"My therapist I went through now should I say they're DCS approved but. he's not connected to it because. I was. I was going to another therapy and I was having that therapy connected to my social worker but there's been some changes I guess policy changes so with this therapist on I like her she's she's on she's, but I do know that there's a. Consent form. That. I have to sign. yeah as stating exactly what I want to social worker to know. So I feel like I could I could talk to him about that, without her like yeah. yeah going to the social."
226.0,Provider,yeah just put some direction. yeah same here.
16538.0,Patient,"Going I know I know that, even though I relapsed I tried my best to keep it under the table. I didn't want to. prolong my kids being about me, which is why I got in contact with you guys. Because I just. wanted to stop I just didn't know how."
226.0,Provider,yeah exactly.
