298.0,Provider,"Okay, so tell me about your life and what's."
5487.0,Patient,"everything's about the same it's just I haven't been able, I can feel i'm I sort of kind of going into like a little little slight depression. it's just my sleep i'm happy I wake up like. I want to say, like two to three times a week when i'm sleeping or three in the morning and I can't go back to sleep. So throughout the day i'm fatigued I watched my granddaughter and it's like oh it's just say all comes down on me, so I don't know what's going on."
298.0,Provider,You know. there's something to be said for patterns that you've developed this pattern of waking up at that time. That it is so hard to now. you're taking murtaza pain 7.5 milligrams at that time.
5487.0,Patient,yeah I take it around I fall asleep already and take it around eight 830 no later than nine o'clock.
298.0,Provider,And so. And do you take any gap a pension at that time for me.
5487.0,Patient,"No, I don't take any other penton I stopped taking together pendant because I feel like it's not working for me."
298.0,Provider,So here's what the latest studies are showing. i'm not saying take away you're getting any medications. What they're saying is. That gabba penton works to keep people asleep. So if you were to take. Like. Even a small dose of 100 milligrams or 300. milligrams with your murtaza being possibly can increases your Stage Three and stage for sleep is what studies are saying I kind of feel like it's worth a try. To see okay even can get you to sleep get you over that hump and get you into a better. Okay vm rhythm.
5487.0,Patient,yeah I have a gabba banton here at at home and. I have 800 800 milligrams So do I just cut it in half. Can you are and. that's fine. Try.
298.0,Provider,"Employees and forth yeah. tried for a couple of nights in force, and that would give you like 200 milligrams to take with your murtaza pain. And if you took even 300 it wouldn't be that big of a deal. Okay, just. Just to see if that helps. How is your anxiety levels."
5487.0,Patient,My anxiety levels have. they're kind of about the same but. I feel like maybe we could take her off a little bit if you. feel like we can.
298.0,Provider,"I would love. To just a little bit. Because okay. um if we needed again. Like something. Bad happens at least you know, we would do that so you're at six milligrams a day the idea would be to go down to five milligrams for two weeks, and then down to four milligrams and I would think that the you know the sun rose."
5487.0,Patient,yeah so but it's that.
298.0,Provider,"Slow of a taper down it's a two week thing so um. it's almost easier if because remember, we talked about this before the two milligrams are made differently than the one milligrams. Because yeah. filter that they use them it's. Better to. Cut your xanax."
5487.0,Patient,In half and.
298.0,Provider,"yeah and get one milligrams so. Okay, and I want you to do is. hold to that extra half and put it aside."
5487.0,Patient,A little baggie and hold it.
298.0,Provider,"Inside right now, and so do five milligrams for two weeks. And then I don't know yeah five milligrams for two weeks and."
5487.0,Patient,They will.
298.0,Provider,go down to four milligrams.
5487.0,Patient,Okay sounds good.
298.0,Provider,And it looks like you're due for a refill.
