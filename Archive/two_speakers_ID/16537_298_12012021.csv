And what I didn't know is that my brother had offered $20 to any of the young men who caught the garter so they were had all this aggression that they were going to get the garter. And the garter sell and the where the boys looked they they knew the garter went there but they couldn't find it and it was like this 90 year old woman who would come to our wedding it had fallen into her bra. I saw where it was, and I saw all the boys dies at her feet and they were like going through her jacket and and she's just like you know she didn't even realize that there was. A game going on. So I get there and I yell at the boys to back off and they're really aggressive and they're not listening to me and I said backup and she looks at me and she says what did they want with me. said ma'am we just through the garter and she says well why did they think I have it. ma'am you do have, it can be. broke down your shirt she loves all she starts cracking up. As she pulled it out oh that was I just thought that was the funniest. um so I want to hear from others, what was the last laugh, you had what happened, why was it funny to you."

We laugh every day over there, I don't know who says what somebody makes a joke about something that we laugh so hard that we're all laying back hold in our bellies just because. I can't remember i'm not good at remembering jokes you know you know what, what do you get across what would you get when you present elephants in a rhino elephant oh that's nice so and you're told me that at the time best. Remember the lady's laughing really hard, and it was needed, and it was a long time since I left like that."
298.0,Provider,yeah it's great Thank you Ryan.
16537.0,Patient,"I think last time I had a water fight with my kids. my daughter. Have as big water gun and shoes, you know sneaking up on people and spraying them and just thought it was the funniest thing, but then she goes to spray my dog and she just lost it when she got my Doc in the face and I don't know why I just like it was the funniest thing."
298.0,Provider,"I love it, thank you for sharing these. The last time that I had a laugh with other people. We were planning a wedding and we were trying to come up with what gifts to give people, and we have so many animals that are house. my daughter came up with the idea that anybody who comes from out of town gets a gift of an animal at our House and we started dividing up which animals went to which people. It was hilarious I I laughed so hard I I think I almost lost my pants. And there was like five of us. Around the table, and you know we we would just amp it up a little bit higher about you know what we would give to these people for their gifts. I love laughing there's so much to be said for how important it is on the brain it up the dopamine in your brain, you know when we don't get enough DoCoMo mean we see the world is very blah just la. So my challenge to you this week is to find what makes you laugh like what really makes you laugh and report it back to me next week, like if stories make you laugh. If people falling on a banana peel makes you laugh there's so many different types of humorous and take some time to look up if you guys have the Internet what laughter yoga is. there's little classes on it. And the more it's kind of laughter is kind of like one of those things if you get in the habit of doing it you're quicker to do it and you can be pulling yourself out of depressions all sorts of good things you know the same laughter is the best medicine or something like that. Okay guys we're going to end group early Oh, by the way, i'm going to a comedy club tomorrow night i'm on vacation. Right now. In South Carolina i'm at the beach at a resort town and I bought tickets to a comedy club next week. tomorrow night tomorrow night and in a few minutes, the reason we're meeting early is i'm headed to a luau and a few minutes.
