And I told him again I said, you know that's you know in California that's legal and and I said i've been smoking, for a very long time. And I don't take advantage of it or anything I said, you can even go to the clinic and just go in with your ID and get some. edibles or whatever, so why you take a trip and he started like some stuff at me and I got really mad. And then, of course, I came up here and i'm bouncing back and forth, because my energy's going i'm told my boyfriend i'm like because i'm like he's telling you all i'm going to go up there i'm like okay Come on, you know you want to come up here and try to fight his fight my boyfriend. And said i'll be down i'll be right with him to fight with with you. And I told him so you're not supposed to be like sitting there doing stuff with your car, here too, and like maintenance or whatever, if you say. redoing the engine and everything, this is an apartment complex you're not supposed to do that that's another thing so i'm like there's. there's a lot of things to doing that you're not supposed to be doing, but you think you're invisible and you're the King of these apartments and you're not. I know I know a lot more about you obviously and I told him I said I obviously you don't know where you're from I say you don't know where you're coming where you're where you should be or where you're from because that's not how we do it here. i've been here for 20 years and we'll see he's like you don't even live here I don't even live here, but yet your dog comes up and jumps and give them a note gets in my face and girls at me and it's a big dog and it's not on a leash and where are you around the corner."
759.0,Provider,So the complaint says that he needs to have his dog on a leash.
13135.0,Patient,yeah. You always have them out where he's always walking them without a freakin leash all the time.
759.0,Provider,And he can you know go and attacking one. one. Yes.
13135.0,Patient,"Those are his know which is already happened before and i'm just that people have is that people just don't know where he lives that the neighbors around in the apartment complex, they just don't know where he lives at. night and I told him I said, keep up with your crap I said because I will call the animal control and I was taking it away from you, because you are not. Even a new that's my dog is a certified and I walk on a leash. i'm trying to she's still a baby. She jumped yes, I see all that, but again I have her on a leash I have control. Is not understanding. yeah, I guess, just like."
759.0,Provider,"yeah that's setting you know, the fact that you continue to do that, even though you tried to talk to him calmly about it and. He still is not willing to kind of like dog on a leash and then he brought up your marijuana use, you know and different things you know that's a neighbor dad yeah. Definitely is kind of pushing buttons."
13135.0,Patient,"yeah but I mean that's what I told him I might I don't see and I told him I said you don't understand I said. i'm not a person who's just going to walk away Okay, so we just want to keep running your mouth you're running your mouth i'm still gonna be here. So i'm going to be here and then so it says. I might I stand up for myself. I stand up and i'm. Setting up for him, you know I mean. I told him to I said, if it was your wife been doing. The same thing, but and I told him I just don't appreciate you doing this is not what this is more more than once that that has. happened like this. So that's that's why i'm now like really getting him and yelling at him. And then I have the issue with my mom my mom my mom was upset with him because I didn't go over there for Christmas. But you know it was like I didn't know anything they didn't tell me this schedule or anything. yeah and um but they told my son and his girlfriend about it and because she's like oh i'm gonna coach your mom's for dinner for dinner there hadn't I said really I said no, I wasn't invited you know, normally, they would call us and let us know. You know what time we need to be there, and all this other crap. So no i'm not going to go she's like you know you should go i'm like no i'm not going to just show up like that i'm not going to do it, so no i'm not going to go. So I didn't I didn't go and then to find out that my aunt came to and she's from Arizona, and I haven't seen her for a while now, because she likes to travel a lot and. And I guess she was there at the House and I was I love that was nice, I mean you guys can tell me about my aunt been in town and so Okay, whatever and then I find out that she's upset it Inshallah so i'm just like I can't win I can't lose so whatever. But I had a good Christmas, I went and spent time and went and I went spend time with my family. And then, after that, since we since I wasn't invited my boyfriend was with me, too, we decided to. Go on our own little trip, which we did we went to big bear and last minute decision to go to be fair, because."

It. So when I move up to. To. To yucca Valley. she'll be warm. she's crazy. Energy."
759.0,Provider,"Energy huh. yeah yeah what else has been on your mind, besides the Read neighbor."
13135.0,Patient,"um. Well, one of my friends got in touch with me I hadn't talked to her like in a long time because. she's I wouldn't my friends, I known for a very long time that she basically like we basically raised rate I basically raised your kids because i've helped potty trained her poison and was doing a lot for her boys and. And I dropped her off like a dime because she has you know she's a Cisco free to bipolar and she has a lot of other things going on with her and. I couldn't hang and I kept telling her like I can't be around negativity I cannot be around it, because when i'm around negativity then it kind of rubs off, you know I don't like it, I just cannot stand it. And, especially when i'm trying to be positive, myself and. So she could, so I had to like she kept being negative and I told her, I had to you know I told her I said i'm going to drop, you said you you're not my friend, and I said i've dropped you before up fucking drop you again. And I did I dropped her again. And I was like and I told her, I was like, but this time I ain't gonna fuckin. i'm not going to call you it's like a relationship, but this time I go back. And um. But her son came to my house on Christmas Day and then he went over to go see his mom and then. He told us. That he went he went to come see us and then she texted me and she was like I you know apology and everything she's. I know you were just trying to be a friend and blah blah blah, and so I believe that she site wanting me to be back on friendship friendship with her. And everything, so I have been like. I did talk to her at first, I was I don't know if I should because all the other times she's has told me i'm going to change i'm going to do better i'll have a better attitude, or whatever it doesn't happen. And, especially when she asked me what we should I do what should I do and then she doesn't listen to me or whatever, or I give her advice and she doesn't go through and i'm just like. I can't take care of you, and try to take care of myself that's like another reason why I dropped it because I can't I couldn't do it and. So anyway, she says, I again, I know you, you know you were really good friend of me, and you, I know you were just trying to help me out and i'm sorry I did this napa blah blah yeah i'm i'm hoping that we can be friends again, you know I know it's going to take time. And i'm like Okay, so it sounds like she's. really sorry, and all this other stuff so. yeah i'm going to go ahead i'm going to talk to her, so I did i'm talking to her now and i'm trying to see how she's doing and stuff like that. It seems like she seems like she's doing a little bit better she still has a I don't know yet because i've only had like two conversations with her so she's an up and down person she's not on medication anymore, which i'm really concerned about that. because she was on it for a very, very long time, and to drop it like that I don't think she should have done it. Right, but I don't know but i've been also talking about this, you know about you guys so maybe you know if she comes down or later i'm just refer her to you guys because she has the same insurance as I do."
