14665.0,Patient,One second. 1-234-567-8910.
386.0,Provider,"Five dates. Okay, so. fulfill the hydroxyl in order for you, because you it is enough to get you over to the next appointment. And I have a feeling that what he did when he when that medication was filled is that he verbally called it to the pharmacy versus electronically sending it in, so I don't have a record of it. And without a record of it it's like it never happened so i'm definitely when you go to group. Be sure to say hey i'm out of the hydrox is he now i'm needing a refill on that you prescribed it last for me and. That way it's like a just kind of like a reminder like hey i'm going to need this one. The visceral I will confirm with the pharmacy and let them i'll give them a verbal order if they say that they still haven't received it, because they should have filled that for you this seroquel I will get a script out for you, for, and the suboxone i'll get a script out for you okay. let's take a look here and then Hannah what they did is your appointments are scheduled for weekly on Wednesdays I currently have you enrolled in our program for opioid use disorder, as well as your physical health. And then, it looks as if I did have emergency and he wasn't able to be seen. I don't know if they canceled all of his group appointments today, but I do know that there was some prescriber coverage for him."
14665.0,Patient,It was Wednesday.
386.0,Provider,"yeah this was well he's been out for a he's he's still not in back in the office yet so um he's he had a family emergency that he had to take care of. Right now, there is absolutely no prescription recommendations that would restrict any type of medication dosing, so I would be able to get you taken care of to get you over to your next appointment, so there won't be. It would be like a full week supply just to get you over or something around okay. It does look like here, for your appointments what it looks like."
14665.0,Patient,"Just received my drug test in the mail. And i've got to do it, I don't know who to call for it."
386.0,Provider,i'll give you the ID number for that one. Okay.

Okay um and then I can verify. Oh, you had financial things going on. Your insurance coverage was being a little wax on yet that's what was going on. Are you currently experiencing any type of withdrawal symptoms."
14665.0,Patient,No ma'am okay.
386.0,Provider,Any recent relapses of any kind.
14665.0,Patient,I have smoked marijuana.
386.0,Provider,"Okay. In regards of marijuana usage on i'm not gonna hold that against you i'm in Oregon in the corporate offices in California so it's legal here for. Recreational as well as a disappointing use and so um what I will say, is it is always better to definitely discuss with the provider if that's something that's going to be allowed i'm. going for further into treatment, but with marijuana if you are going to utilize marijuana what we do recommend is not smoking it using like an edible or like a CBD rub topical. You have that cohort of your physical health so i'm sure there's some type of pain involved with that. And so, or sleep um and so CDs are always see these are amazing I live by them and so um, but we do recommend not smoking because smoke is just not good for the walks. In general, so for physical health reasons that's what we do recommend that if you are going to use it definitely notify the provider to have a discussion with a provider to see if it is allowed. Each State is different each prescribing physician is different, and so there may be different opportunities for you, but in regards of smoking, it just make sure that you're trying to do that as less as possible and, like edibles okay. um. Look here. All right, i'm gonna leave audio for just a second here and i'm going to go over to the walgreens drug store for you and i'm gonna see what we need to do to get these beds out for you OK. I will be right back you'll see me moving but you'll see my mouth move, but you won't be able to hear it. Okay i'll be right back."
