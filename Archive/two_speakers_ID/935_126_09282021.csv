126.0,Provider,Nice that sounds awesome.
935.0,Patient,"yeah so we're going to do that kind of in beginning maybe like second weekend of October. Just because, like we you know we just had gone to Wisconsin two weeks ago. yeah it was just going to be hard to squeeze it in."
126.0,Provider,The very last weekend.
935.0,Patient,yeah around like our anniversary so. So that's really exciting and then even more exciting news is that we put an offer on a house. So yeah. In sacramento in sacramento.
126.0,Provider,hey. Tell me about the House.
935.0,Patient,yeah so we actually it was two houses that we saw that we like. So basically both of them are what's called there were built by what's called like strong brothers. And what they're known for is they make houses that have like a tree limbs in it.
126.0,Provider,"so nice yeah so when you walk in there's like a tree and. yeah there is a whole neighborhood out here, where I live. yeah and it's called the eichler homes. Okay, and every single house in that like five block area there you walk in the front door and there's just a big giant square Atrium. yeah and the House is all around the Atrium so like."
935.0,Patient,awesome.
126.0,Provider,Here the living rooms there there's a bedroom here bedroom here and it's all like in a u shape around the Atrium.
935.0,Patient,"that's super cool yeah, so this is very similar kind of style. Nice yeah um So there you know and again both of them are designed the same. they're what they're what's called a half blacks so the difference between a half plex and a duplex is that a duplex has one owner and then they like rent out, you know aside or whatever. But a half plex is actually treated as two separate properties. Even though they're connected. yeah. The first, the first one we looked at, you could tell you know it's connected by the garage but, yet they had a big like tall kind of long Bush that ran down the middle so that was very like separate. And so we liked that one, and then you know it had the Atrium and everything that we love, because we my wife's really big into like the plants and."
126.0,Provider,Just that kind oh yeah i've seen some some of those where they are amazing with buying and.
935.0,Patient,yeah bird.
126.0,Provider,cages hanging and oh my get so crazy with those.
935.0,Patient,"So cool and there's actually like a faucet like you know, like where you put a hose like in there in like that."
126.0,Provider,He can water your plants right there.
935.0,Patient,yeah.
126.0,Provider,Totally it's awesome.
935.0,Patient,"And then, plus the skylight and stuff. And so the second when we went to we went to what is the Monday, so it was yesterday we saw it in it had just gone back on the market. In our realtors like hey do you want to come, you know, want to go look at and we're like yes, we want to see that one that's the only one we really want to see, because after we saw that first one that we, like everything we've seen prior to that and when looking at places nothing."
126.0,Provider,compares to that.
935.0,Patient,"compares to that and. What we like We actually had a friend. Who owned a house in carmichael that was designed by the same builders and I believe. That had that hmm so that's kind of how we came about knowing about it. And then, this one, we saw yesterday was. In another kind of good location not too far from where we live now i'm in actual much better kind of area and stuff so really convenient to used to knowing what's around here. And it's kind of tucked off and its own little it's off of a main like a one of the main kind of roads that connect to the highway. But then it's. In its own little outlet and. it's the one right in the back corner so it's it's very this one very you could barely tell us even connected to the other side. Okay bye but yeah. awesome but it's like a little bigger little more space that has a fireplace and it. Has a little more yard and stuff so we're like we liked it. It was actually listed less than the other one but way way, everything is with offering more and everything so we're we had our real dirt putting an offer in. A little over the asking price."
126.0,Provider,that's a good idea. yeah yeah.
935.0,Patient,"And, and so in another kind of thing that we kind of maybe have because, again we don't have a lot of cash down we can't be super competitive. My wife. wife and I, as much as we love this. This House are both. Okay, with like if if we can't get outbid or we can't get it that's fine we'll keep lookers."
126.0,Provider,there's other fish in the sea.
935.0,Patient,"yeah so we're not like hung up like it's got to be this one and. So what's interesting about this property is it just had gone back on the market, and it was in like contract like just recently, and they had someone who had made a cash offer or like 420 5000 in which was like I don't I don't know what it was listed that before but way over."
126.0,Provider,Okay.
935.0,Patient,"What it is now and. Basically, they got through to like the inspection part in this, and then the buyer said that they wanted like 25,000 back or something and then the seller, you know."
126.0,Provider,said.
935.0,Patient,"Yes, and screw you so so what our realtor was kind of telling us was that the After talking to the agent that the sellers it's like this lady and her mom who's older and her mom's I think going to like a home. they've lived there for six years and basically after that experience they kind of want to find somebody who you know they can kind of trust that will just call through it, even if it's kind of the old fashioned. So. it's that kind of gave us some hope that. yeah hey you know we write a letter and we."
126.0,Provider,"put her off exactly. If you know that picture of yourself in the letter. yeah because. you're sure yeah the House that I live in, I told you i'm renting a room and my ex husband's house right. Yes, Okay, so this House we bought it almost 30 years ago."
935.0,Patient,mm hmm.
126.0,Provider,"um and the people that were living here were the original owners, so what happened is they had four kids. And they expanded the two there was two bedrooms downstairs and they expanded that they doubled them because I guess they had two girls and two boys, so they all house and pushed it like out like 12 feet, further to make the two bedrooms bigger. And then they added a. Like a recreation room upstairs for all the kids. And that's where we ended up putting our master bedroom because it's gigantic it's like the whole first floor but, on the second floor with no walls, so the people they had they were not accepting anybody's they had already moved out their kids had grown up. But the people that were trying to sell it who were in like their 60s or 70s, by then, they had brought like beach chairs into the House and they sat in this House every day. Even after they moved. And when people would come through it, you know they talked to them and and they picked us out because they said we. Like you guys, you have two kids, this is a fat, they would not sell the House for like nine months. And so, in the realtor showed this House she was like yeah we don't know why they're holding on to it, we don't know why they're not accepting any offers so and we lowball but we came in low."
935.0,Patient,yeah it.
126.0,Provider,"Was 30 years ago. And they were like we feel we feel secure selling it to you, we saw your kids we saw you guys go through the House, we know you'll take care of it. And because it was so attached to the House."
935.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
126.0,Provider,"So that was pretty amazing because Oh, there was a lot of people interested in its 2500 square feet."
935.0,Patient,yeah that's a.
126.0,Provider,Four bedroom three bathroom. yeah so I mean it's a nice and then behind the House is just open space there's no houses it's all hiking area.
935.0,Patient,Oh awesome.
126.0,Provider,yeah that's the best part about it. yeah you're hiking anywhere.
935.0,Patient,"yeah that is and that's what we've been realizing when we went and looked at some properties is just how important the location is. You know, like that's such a big thing you know, like at first, before we even started looking it's like Okay, we want a yard, which we do want a decent yard, because we have. Gone like. Right, there were certain things that we want, but then you don't really realize like how important like the location, the neighborhood where is. That because we saw some places, there is one place where we pulled up is kind of a cute house pull up and it's like right next like right behind a highway that has the wall, you know. yeah so it's like the highways right there anyone you're looking out like the front window it's right into this wall, where the highway is."
126.0,Provider,"Oh, my God."
935.0,Patient,We look down like two houses down the street there's like a homeless can. Love more like no. We got this is absolutely not.
126.0,Provider,"Never people till I my when my ex and I first got divorced I moved out I. Had a condo next to the freeway I lived in that condo for 10 years with my two kids and the noise from the, even though it had a big old wall. yep the noise was horrendous and then like you could hear the trucks, you know shifting in the middle of the night. Here pull your car. accidents. away, it was a curse."
935.0,Patient,"To the freeway yeah and that song that's why like we're looking at two is like like value right because that's. When everything kind of goes up like is this place like because my wife also does like interior design work so we're totally Okay, with a place that needs some pain and some things. So something that we can kind of improve and add value to and. Right location is so important, with that. So yeah that's why and then so this place like it has a it's part of an Hoa."
126.0,Provider,So there's like a mature Hoa fees.
935.0,Patient,"So I think this one was around $30 a month. yeah under $50 a month, not a lot."
126.0,Provider,I would hear the Hoa fees are three or $400.
935.0,Patient,"Yes, so I saw some houses that were like that and it's weird because, like you look at it like okay that's kind of in our range I looked down it's like Hoa 308 among."
126.0,Provider,it's like okay that's a whole nother rant.
935.0,Patient,yeah exactly so I was like no because the first one we looked at was 300 a year around us was like $28 a month.
126.0,Provider,Okay that's. that's very affordable.
935.0,Patient,"yeah this other one is a little bit more, but it's still under 50. So yeah so that's kind of cool. But yeah it's it's really a really cool property and has so much character has like windows that go down to the floor and up and i'm windows so it's just it's really cool it's it's very like a unique yeah what my wife and I would like."
126.0,Provider,What year was it built in.
935.0,Patient,It was built in the 80s.
126.0,Provider,"Okay, so it's not too old."
935.0,Patient,"yeah not too old and even the other one was built in the 70s, I think, but I think this the string brothers, this company that built these a lot of theirs was like the 7080 period. This is a whole different side of town, the first one we looked at was near carmichael which a lot of these homes are built in, so it was in like the area. Where this one's in a whole different area but same builder. The weird it's just this little outlet of maybe. Having like five houses and again, probably, I think all of them, or at least four of the five were half plexus and they're all the same kind of builder you know. So yeah so we're we're excited we're we'll find out more by Friday I think the other agent said but yeah we're just kind of hanging on the hope that you know. The seller, you know chooses us or. You know, with us and doesn't because we're we're kind of at the top of our budget of what we want to spend."
126.0,Provider,yeah and you don't want to overextend yourself that's.
935.0,Patient,"Exactly, and when we meet my wife and I taught, even if they countered and wanting to go more like we we would just have to. back out like we are offer putting in is already a little over over the. Asking price and it's weird because they had this over $400,000 offer to begin with, that fell through, and then they priced it at like 370 but we're offering like 390."
126.0,Provider,"Oh, that should be. That should be more than enough."
935.0,Patient,yeah cuz I got realtor was like. said I would do that just because if you go like lower closer to the asking and then they've already had offers like.
126.0,Provider,Exactly they're just gonna blow you off.
935.0,Patient,they're going to blow us off So yes please we put something that's close but. again at our top of where we. will want to go and. Go anymore so. But yeah so that's exciting.
126.0,Provider,"That is very exciting is super exciting so you'll know by by next week, if you."
935.0,Patient,yeah we should yeah for sure we should know by next week. Definitely more and then and then like we have like an fha loan or something so there's like a process of like the inspections. there's. we're. we're not like tied in any way like we can always you know back out if something comes up or we find something out we don't.
126.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
935.0,Patient,Which is kind of Nice because it is kind of very overwhelming like it's our first home so.
126.0,Provider,Oh yeah.
935.0,Patient,yeah.
126.0,Provider,A lot to take care of with the by. yeah house.
935.0,Patient,"yeah you know and so much to take care of you know it's going to be, you know quite a bit more than what we're used to paying for rent but um yeah."
126.0,Provider,"I just definitely worth it, because it's going towards something. Yes, throwing the money away, which I feel like rent is just like throwing the money away."
935.0,Patient,yeah you're just get yeah you're just getting by. Right.
126.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
935.0,Patient,"And that's why I, I was, I had a golf lesson, with a client of mine that i've known for a long time, and he was in the mortgage business and. he's retired now, but he kind of gave me a good peace of mind, because it's so easy to think like oh it's a seller's market and so expensive and should just wait and blah blah. And he said that you know the saddest thing he saw in his profession was people who are 50 you know 4050 years old coming to buy their first. Homes they could have bought a home 10 years ago built equity, you know and then. Then, been able to get more or whatever."
126.0,Provider,"Right, but then The thing is, if you live from paycheck to paycheck. You don't save any money there's no way you can put it down payment. yeah and young people nowadays. yeah it without their parents help most. Young not be able to buy a house."
935.0,Patient,yeah for sure.
126.0,Provider,"it's just I mean my mom told me when they first bought the House that we moved into as kids it was like $60,000. yeah."
935.0,Patient,So crazy hey.
126.0,Provider,"She lived there for 45 years. The whole neighborhood went completely downhill, I mean nobody had grass anymore."
935.0,Patient,People are.
126.0,Provider,"Working their cars on their front dirt everybody had the iron, you know. Okay, and does."
935.0,Patient,It was a horrible way yeah.
126.0,Provider,"her house was so nice and she had been there for 45 years, even though she got her car stolen out of her driveway to time. And I kept telling her mom you need to move, you need the well my car's only been stolen two times um. Well guess what what. ever been stolen, so what."
935.0,Patient,that's three times too many right yeah students too many.
126.0,Provider,"So when she finally moved it was like she had already done, like three refinances."
935.0,Patient,mm hmm.

935.0,Patient,yeah.
126.0,Provider,"It was just the in the neighborhood went completely my kids used to ask me when we go out to visit their grandma. Why she live here. Oh yeah Why is she living here is a horrible spy go, will you need to say that to grandma because, in her own little house, she was so, and you know she had a great backyard and plan and all but you step outside the front and it's like Oh, this is horrible. yeah so we did finally convince her to move out would near where I live, I live in thousand oaks she lives in Newbury park so it's about 15 minutes. Okay yeah."
935.0,Patient,yeah.
126.0,Provider,San Fernando valley that has definitely gone way down he'll it's just a big ghetto now. yeah that's that's where I was born and raised San Fernando Valley.
935.0,Patient,yeah.
126.0,Provider,"The nice thing about where I live, now here in thousand oaks there's no signage that like there's no billboards. And can't do it can't make any building more than three stories. there's no telephone Poles all the electricity is underground. hmm and all the signage is I level so like let's say for a bank, they have like a big Granite piece of rock on their front. In front of the bank that says the bank name so there's no riches there's no signs there's no neon none of that."
935.0,Patient,yeah that's really cool.
126.0,Provider,"And they planned it that way, and then you kind of drive around and you realize hey where's the telephone Poles. All the electricity is underground, which is what sc he was supposed to do many, many years ago, because now, you know when it gets super windy they turn off their electricity. yeah just so the transformers won't catch fire. A long time ago they had all this money put all the electricity underground everywhere, but they never. They never did it. And so that I mean, and I think it's so stupid that you're turning my electricity off because you're."
935.0,Patient,Being right.
126.0,Provider,is not up to snuff you know that's that's like the stupidest reason to turn off your electricity.
935.0,Patient,Oh it's going to.
126.0,Provider,"be the day, we have to turn off your electricity. You got that in your area."
935.0,Patient,yeah so we got pg&e and they're the ones that you know the. Castro was that small town that just gotten called.
126.0,Provider,paradise.
935.0,Patient,"paradise, yes, so pg&e it was their power lines in the you know they're watching the wind and fire whatever and it shifted and they had time to turn it off, but they didn't and then just in golf that so now they're very cautious like that, where if it's windy people. turn off everybody's electricity yeah."
126.0,Provider,Instead of fixing the problem.
935.0,Patient,Exactly it's stupid.
126.0,Provider,"And then also pg&e was liable for fire, they have had out here, where the Woolsey."
935.0,Patient,mm hmm.
126.0,Provider,Half a ventura burn down that's why there's a whole housing shortage because whole apartment buildings burned down. yeah that was caused by a transformer.
935.0,Patient,sparking yep. yeah at a point that yeah they should you know change that or make.
126.0,Provider,or put something around it so. yeah I mean.
935.0,Patient,Come on.
126.0,Provider,"it's 2021. Right to turn off everybody's electricity cuz it's windy that's not really a good solution. And then, what about the people who you know, like they have their medication in the. refrigerator or they have you know they have to take oxygen so they have to plug it in they need they're like."
935.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
