15045.0,Patient,Groups probably going to be too much for me because I. When I started the program it was you know co pays $45 to see us copay for our doesn't see Christine and it didn't mention that would be a copay of $90 for a group.
298.0,Provider,Group and
15045.0,Patient,And that to me so that's that caught me out of blue so.
298.0,Provider,"yeah and I can't take the group completely out of the table, do you know what I mean that that that is apparent, but what I could do, and what I could do, and you talk to Christine about it because of finances is bump it down to once a month. And and and if you ask to see me, you can say she can tell trap me, can we do a breakout room you like we do a breakout room and then I could get a visit in with you, and maybe that would help mitigate any costs and i'm just trying to work with you on. yeah required for group and what your costs are so you wouldn't need to see me once a month, you can see me in the group then i'll pull you out and have a little visit with you. Does that work for you."
15045.0,Patient,"That that'll work for me yeah i'll talk to sustain about it and I figured there was some way that I could make it work, you know."
298.0,Provider,"Well, and you're not the first person who has those crazy fees. Sorry, I just dropped by mail on the floor and picking it up."
15045.0,Patient,that's all good.
298.0,Provider,So how is your sleep.
15045.0,Patient,sleep not so great sleep is not been so great. i've always had a problem with sleep that's why i'm taking the melatonin and the day if I ever mean. That was what my my previous. Like I just suggested I do. But now sleep is just like I get home from work at nine o'clock I take my evening meds about 10 and I can't sleep until midnight one o'clock in the morning and then i'm having nightmares or i'll wake up randomly and. You know. Not a very restful sleep. sleep is rough.
298.0,Provider,Okay um are you wanting any help you know medic medicine wise with sleep something better.
15045.0,Patient,"i'd be down for that, like i'd be down for something better to sleep, but that would be up to you know. well."
298.0,Provider,"how this works is you start at something better than melatonin if that doesn't work we climb the ladder and we may find that you do really well with a sleeping MED. every once in a while there is quite a few myths out there, that are not addicting for sleep, and you can take them whenever you want, you can stop them it doesn't it's not regular you don't it can be, but it doesn't. The name of the medication we start with is called transit don't Have you ever heard of it. Okay trouser down is the first start if you sleep on tries to don't then kudos the thing with trouser down is, it is a first generation anti depressant but its first generation, so the side effect of it with sleep well we use it at such a small dose. That it really doesn't do much for anti depression, but it gets people to sleep finding the dosage is the trick some people need a quarter of a pill I swear to God, some people too. Much and they said they slept on it and other people need three pills to go to sleep, so I don't know what it would take you would have to communicate and say hey this is where I feel like works for me. For sleep. And do you can wait email address to let me know just follow up with me on how the medicine is working."
15045.0,Patient,"No, I don't."
298.0,Provider,"I will give that to you. And that may help you. You know, be able to communicate with me if you're having a problem pretty quickly I pretty much can do just answer medication problems, so my email is T as in tanya Escobar my last name at bright heart health."
15045.0,Patient,cool.
298.0,Provider,"and Take it when you want to if you need to tablets go ahead, I would start with a half a tablet how you know if you've taken too much is you can't seem to shake it the next day you're like still want to sleep."
15045.0,Patient,So.
298.0,Provider,"If your wake up groggy it's too much cut the dosage in half of whatever half is. Well, does that make sense."
15045.0,Patient,yeah that's fair.
298.0,Provider,"And if you hit the bed and you're exhausted and don't take it okay that's fine. i'm not. No, no big deal either way."
15045.0,Patient,yeah now i'm i'm cool with that.
298.0,Provider,"Okay, I am good to go. Anything else to update me on your life changes move."
15045.0,Patient,"No just the the common grief, I think, with passing a family member so. This past week I had some some mild anger, you know, like this irritation at work just you know that kind of whole thing of like yeah life sucks because my dad's gone, but i've been focusing on positive things like i'm a minister, so I get to do is memorial something that's."
298.0,Provider,"I remember, you said that in group. What what I like as a Christian kind of minister I don't know. devil worship ministers I don't know."
15045.0,Patient,"I mean well basically like everybody's got you know some form of. You know, religious guides but I went through a group called universal life church online about 18 years ago. And I actually got my ministry credentials through them. And while my main beliefs path is pagan. i've been able to use it to help friends and family members with weddings. You know, we coded was really bad I would go to the hospital and read passages from the Bible to sick, you know. Like i'm i'm a firm believer in you know, religion, all religions. it's everybody has their own thing and I don't mind reading from the Bible if that's what they believe I mean even. Even. Even Jesus at one point had a it was healing somebody like one pagan you know, like and I don't believe once you leave it's like well by your faith your. Even Jesus had that same kind of concept of. You know I will. You know, do your thing because that's what you need."
298.0,Provider,uh huh.
15045.0,Patient,You know it's not about me it's about the other person.
298.0,Provider,"that's awesome well i'm glad that you can be of assistance, and I think that gives you a richer life, knowing that. I think. I think the. faith is important people don't realize how much it contributes to your mental health. yeah it's it's we are definitely in my opinion, spiritual beings of some sort so that's a part of us."
15045.0,Patient,"yeah exactly so I got I like having the faith, you know it's not the same as everybody's faith but it's mine. Right and. I can't nobody can take it away from me."
298.0,Provider,"So, when you say pagan are you like wicked."
15045.0,Patient,"So I am I count myself as a nondenominational pagan which means because paganism is earth based religions so we're through, it is a soft true North additional lists. Right like that. So I have a pan theistic earth based tradition that I follow that's kind of open ended, so I have deities from the Egyptian Pantheon DVDs from the Greek deities norse the Irish Gaelic unity so like I kind of see myself as nondenominational."
