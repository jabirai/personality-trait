298.0,Provider,"I could give you a little bit of a medication just a little bit of something called zyprexa it would help you sleep at night, it would slow down the thoughts. So that you're not you know constantly thinking, and it would help the Prozac be stronger as far as being more effective. The downside of zyprexa is with somebody not that it would happen to you because I use it it's such a small dose but the downside is is it can cause weight gain so."

298.0,Provider,"Okay, well, I would be happy. To give you some it would so help that ticket at bedtime. Because the side effect is it will make you sleepy. We want to take a half a tablet. and see if that starts to break the depression."
13514.0,Patient,So I take both of them I take my Prozac in the morning is that okay.
298.0,Provider,"yeah you can take Prozac in the morning, and you can take the zyprexa a bed team. And just know that take half a tablet till we see how you respond I don't want to knock you out to the point that you're sleeping too late in the day, the next day OK OK. And it should really help with your thoughts at being being more calm."
