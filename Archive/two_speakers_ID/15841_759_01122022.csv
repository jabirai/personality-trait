759.0,Provider,that's I did nervous so what's the feeling.
15841.0,Patient,i'm excited i'm not really nervous I just. I feel like. i'm just a little like i'm still getting used to like waking up really early. Because I usually go to bed at like four and wake up at like 11 or 12.
759.0,Provider,"Oh, my gosh girl."
15841.0,Patient,"girl it's. A man i'm a mess. But I have to wake up at like a and then gets to work at nine and then. i'll be working like i'll be working like nine hours ish kind of shifts but. not really nine hours but it depends, when I leave because sometimes you can't leave like right at 530 you know. But yeah i'm excited and i'm just ready to be done with the computer training because it's honestly really boring. But. Then I also like. I know how to say this, but I broke up with my boyfriend like two days ago, so I actually did decide to go through with it and i'm feeling really good about it."
759.0,Provider,"Oh, so you broke up with him."
15841.0,Patient,uh huh.
759.0,Provider,overtax oh.
15841.0,Patient,"I felt so bad about it, but it wasn't like it wasn't planning to do it that way, it was just that I was with my friends, and it was like a high school friend that I hadn't seen in like. Probably three years, and he used to be one of my best friends hey he always has been my best friend, but he has a kid now, and he has like. You know he has like his own house and like a girlfriend and stuff and. he's actually in an open relationship so he actually has two girlfriends but anyways yeah he wanted to meet his girlfriends and his baby and see him again. His name is Jose he's really cool but um my boyfriend has never liked him because I in the beginning of our relationship, I was I used to like confide in Jose. about how my boyfriend was like. mistreating me and stuff because, like he used to hit me or whatever and Jose didn't like that, obviously, because he doesn't think I should be getting hit and I shouldn't but. My when I told my boyfriend that Jose doesn't like him, he he just hated him ever since so they never liked each other and so. I had forgotten to text my boyfriend back because I was talking to jose's girlfriend for like an hour and a half. we're having a really good conversation and and my boyfriend got mad because I didn't text him back, and I was like you know what and I kind of went off, and I was like. I was like i'm sick of this like we're not happy anymore, and I don't think we should be together and he's like very bringing up with me and I kind of like danced around it a little bit, so I was scared to really say it outright but. But yeah ended up being the end of the conversation, where I was like I just don't see this like going anywhere anymore, and I think that you need to go. Do something else or be with someone else you know because I felt like it was really weird because Jose I was telling his girlfriend how my boyfriend has been like guilt tripping me the past couple days. Like he sent me a picture of him crying because I told him I went to an estate sale. Really weird. Because it is and. Then he started doing the same thing, like telling me that he thinks I don't care about him because we never talk and, like, I wish you would tell me, you want to face time i'm like why don't you just facetime me. you're my boyfriend like you could have. You could have called me this whole time the whole week, you could have called me I already told you that i'm not busy, and you just didn't like you you're blaming it on me, but the phone goes both ways. yeah so I was getting frustrated in the moment and I was with my friend, that I hadn't seen in like three years and I was getting mad because he's like Fuck Jose, and all this because I told him I was seeing Jose. yeah and and i'm like What do you mean Fuck Jose like What do you do like he just us making me mad, and I was just like. cuz it seems like every time i'm doing something that makes me happy or that i'm excited about he he wants me to be like on the same level as him as like being miserable and. Not being proud of myself and. actually brought that up to in the conversation I was like and you never even you can never even be happy for me like it's a different thing if you're depressed if you're really struggling. Like i've begged him to go to therapy I begged him to get help I begged him to go talk to somebody and he goes. I can, because I know that they're getting paid to do it and that's the only reason why they listen to you and i'm like okay like that's not. exactly like yes it's a job. Surprise, but it's also. Like when you talk to a therapist or psychiatrist or psychologist you're talking to people who have expertise in this. In this mental illness."
759.0,Provider,"don't get in this field to make money you know that's not the purpose, because anyone will tell you that you know people who get in this field therapy it's not just a job to us it's. More you know so."
15841.0,Patient,"it's not just a job to me I don't see it that way you know, and I I just I don't think that I feel like that's just his anxiety taking over like I really think that's just seeing his anxiety and him being so afraid to to faces trauma. And to face his mental illness. And him blaming it on like outside. You know stimuli or whatever. But it's really not I really think that he doesn't believe that I think he's just afraid of opening up and accepting the fact that he's traumatized and has problems. But I didn't say all that I just said, like. not making me happy. anymore basically and. yeah I. Think. He won't he didn't take it very well, but I I he tried to call me, actually, but I was like i'm not calling you right now, I do not want to have this. conversation I feel like. yeah because I feel like once you bring like vocal tone and like facial expressions into it, it gets so much more emotionally charged and I wasn't ready for that in that moment, so. Plus, I was at my friend's House you know. yeah so."
759.0,Provider,You are ready to have that conversation just get with them.
15841.0,Patient,"No, I don't think I ever would be I don't think ever will be and, like, if I had to do that in person there's no way I would have just been like you don't make me happy anymore, I mean I might have because i've been feeling like this for a long time."
759.0,Provider,i'm coming.
15841.0,Patient,"yeah I feel like our relationship kind of expired like a like a year ago, at least, to me, and I feel like he was feeling that distance, but he just wasn't ready to accept it like I feel like he was really in denial. mm hmm which I understand because. He like I said he has really severe anxiety like he's been actually treated for anxiety before, but he. He didn't like really keep he didn't he didn't stay consistent with it. didn't stay consistent with therapy, because the therapy that he was in his mom was in the room, with him, and I feel like he wasn't comfortable like talking about his trauma with her in the room. And so i'm just ever since then he's just not like he's just pretty much ignored it and actually he has a really hard time admitting. That he feels anxious, let alone has been diagnosed with anxiety like he he hates that label it's like a label to him, which I think is just again more anxiety. Like you know and he's also really obsessed with appearance, so I feel like he just doesn't want people to see him as being like. Less than because he's mentally ill. mm hmm or I guess like I wouldn't say like mentally ill, is like a good way to describe. illness."
759.0,Provider,yeah so yeah.
15841.0,Patient,"But um yeah he, like. I kept telling him about other things too like I finally I kind of like unloaded a lot all at once, just because I was already like saying it. And I brought up the fact that he is never happy for me like for anything, and I feel like i'm the opposite, with him, like I want him to go out in the world and travel and go do stuff and get a job and have good experiences and learn things and mature from those experiences and. I feel like the only thing that he wanted was like me just to be present. And not present like literally mentally present I just mean like physically present like he just wanted me to exist with him in the same room all the time, no matter what what I had going on. And I feel like in a perfect fantasy world where I don't have any responsibilities and I don't have any. If we could just like exist together and not have to pay bills and not have to work and. Not have to talk to other people ever forever Okay, that would be like if we were the only two people on this planet and we were Adam and Eve that'd be great but it's like that's not how things are. yeah you know and so. And so. I. I was going on about that, and I was just telling you everything like I feel like you never say you're proud of me and stuff and he goes well, I tell other people i'm proud of you, I tell other people about how you know how proud I am of not."
759.0,Provider,Saying that to me.
15841.0,Patient,"Exactly, and I was like I don't care what you're saying to other people, because I need to hear that from you. And maybe I should have communicated that a long time ago, but I feel like I tried pretty hard to tell him like that I need him to be more. openly communicative with me and he just never did until and until this day, two days ago, when I was when we were having this conversation, and he tried to bargain with me. And I was like dude you there's no bargaining here like it's, the damage is done it's too late, like and even if I wanted to work on this. i've already pretty much made up my mind that we that we don't belong together anymore like I i've made up my mind that this relationship has ran its course it served its purpose and it's not serving either of us anymore and that's okay. You know I just feel like he was in denial about it for the whole past year, while I was thinking about it, and he was just kind of like. not really willing to accept the. I think he just never pictured that it could be possible that we wouldn't last forever, but it's like we met at a really weird time. And I was under desperate circumstances and I really felt like he loved me and I really felt like we belong together, but I also was doing drugs, and I also we also were both doing drugs on a regular basis, and we also. Both didn't really have any responsibilities money wise, I mean I I barely had bills to pay at all and. And I didn't have any goals at that time I was just barely 18 I didn't know what I wanted to do I didn't really feel like I needed to get my own place yet. yeah Aaron. I that was just a different time I mean he was still in high school I literally had just graduated and he was he was supposed to be finishing his senior year of high school that you're."
759.0,Provider,Saying yeah.
15841.0,Patient,"yeah exactly so okay i'm only six months older than him too so we're not really that far apart in age, but it's still like. I feel like there is still a huge maturity gap there, like a lot of everybody that I told about this about this. situation as a whole has said that we're on two different maturity levels, and I feel like I always felt like that was true because it it I started to follow this like mentality that I was his mother. In a way, like, I had to like defend him and make excuses for him when he was acting out and i'm like coddle him, and you know drive him around everywhere and. Like cook for him, clean for him, even though I was already working full time and you know have my own friends and my own social life, to go deal with, but I was. doing all that for him. yeah and there's just a lot to it, I also feel like it was really unfair that he's even admitting that he's out there, like like basically. Almost in a way, taking credit for my work by saying that he's so proud of me because I can't even do that I can't even like I can't even go to my friends and be like oh my boyfriend does this or my boyfriend has. This cool car like. he's literally going around telling people that I have a new car and that I have this cool. job and that I have my own place, and you know I have friends and stuff like I can't even say that about him and that's not fair to me like. yeah I want to be with someone who I feel like has. Similar goals and. Like self inspired ambitions, and you know aspirations with outside of me. yeah basically I want a boyfriend that doesn't feel like he needs a girlfriend."
759.0,Provider,"as independent as you are, you know. yeah I totally get that and it sounds like you know from our last conversation to just conversation that he really used you as a security blanket. Right. You know that's what it sounds like you know, like you, are his you know person who would drive him around take care of him, you know that's. Also, a lot, you know even at a young age to be physically, you know, like responsible almost 4% and if you do those things and i'm sure you did the Al love to i'm sure you did it out of you know, wanting to be with him, but still."
15841.0,Patient,"Well, I was at first, but then it turned into an obligation and guilt thing you know. Like that that I was making I was making decisions, out of fog and I was with him our fear and obligation and guilt and I when I realized that. That was when I finally like made my decision in my head that we couldn't be together anymore, because I I don't want to live the rest of my life like that, and I feel like that was kind of. Like a turning point for me so that I could be like so that I could have that being able to go through it without decision, even though it was over text and it doesn't take as much courage, as it would in person for me. I still feel like that set the tone for. You know the next 10 years of my life like am I going to keep saying yes to things that are not serving me or am I going to. You know, take that leap and say no, and stick up for myself and let things go, you know what I mean. And so I really feel like I. Without an especially without the support of my friends oh my God like I I would probably just be with him for the next for forever who knows. If I didn't have that support and even support from his mom his own mom she's. been really supportive and trying to help him like cope with it too and she's been helping me to by just being like you know I still want you in my life, and I still asked you and bring you food stuff. Oh, it is."
759.0,Provider,yeah this is really sweet.
15841.0,Patient,"But she's always been there for me we've been like me and her been like best friends, ever since me and her son started dating but she's like she's not like one of those like enabler type mothers that's like obsessed with their son in a weird way she's really like. she's really like aware that he's not perfect and she's like every time I I felt like I felt like I was comfortable i've had enough confidence in her to like come to her whenever I was having issues with him. And she would she would agree with me just be like yeah no he's acting like. I thought it was it was really funny but that really like her, setting that kind of tone with our relationship. Just between me and her really helped me too, because I a lot for a while I use that as an excuse to not break things off because I was like I don't want to lose his mom I don't want to be able to never see his family again but. Now i'm really not and then I realized that that wasn't even true because the way that she treated me like her own kid you know. because she knows that she always know that I had issues with my mom and. That I don't have a mom and stuff like that. yeah well I do but she's just really not around but. So she kind of like assumed that role for me and like that has always meant, so much so that was one of the reasons why I stayed out of like beer, basically, out of fear that I would lose her. But."
759.0,Provider,"You know I lose that mother figure, you know, because you didn't have a strong one guy crying out of it sounds like yeah."
15841.0,Patient,"yeah exactly and um. You know and she's it's it's weird because she actually struggles, with a lot of the same issues that my mom struggle with when I lived with my mom like she's got um I think she has bipolar disorder. And she also has. Like alcoholism and. Okay, she struggles with that kind of thing, and she was also she was 18 when she had my ex and my mom was 16 when she had me so she's also she's also a teen mother. yeah that struggled with you know mental illness and addiction and stuff and the difference between her and my mom is that she actually kind of like stuck around and didn't didn't end up. Like succumbing to it, I guess. yeah I don't know I don't want to say it in a way that's insensitive but like basically that's it she just didn't leave she just didn't abandon her kids. And so I always felt like a really strong connection with her that she was like. Just kind of like meant to be in my life, you know. But that kind of thing always makes me kind of sad because I just feel like. I just feel like why couldn't my mom's day to you know what I mean like she's struggling with the same thing, but she works full time and she's there for her kid and. You know she's responsible. mean she's a functioning alcoholic she's still drinks every day but she's like still there, at least."
759.0,Provider,Access live there at least yeah.
15841.0,Patient,But I just hope that she can like. overcome that stuff.
759.0,Provider,Right.
15841.0,Patient,"Because I know that she goes through it every day she has a hard time. And she's she struggles with really bad depression, too, and I think actually the way that she that she sees therapy and stuff like that is kind of like one of the reasons why my ex feels the way he does about it because he, like. Was she was telling me was that she was she had group therapy for depression once. And she stopped going because she felt like her problems weren't big enough. Now she basically was like gaslighting herself and I was like. don't say that don't say stuff like that, because it's not true, like we're all. we're all injured and in a way, you know, but it doesn't make your injuries any less important than somebody else's just because there's might seem bigger or more painful it doesn't mean that you don't still have a wound."
759.0,Provider,that's true.
15841.0,Patient,And it doesn't mean that you don't still need to heal you know. I can never be a therapist because I would just talk to.
759.0,Provider,"Like. You know it's good to talk, you know, but I want to hear from you, you know what you're going through and everything yeah so thanks for sharing and about you know your whole experience with your boyfriend ex boyfriend he's. So your access and long, and I know that you know between what I have heard about your biological mom and dad she abandoning guys and this lady she stayed there for kids so that's a big difference in your eyes. yeah and so, how you feel about her."
15841.0,Patient,"yeah and actually it's the same with OK, so my high school boyfriend his name has been. So my ex that I just broke up with his Gregorio and then my high school boyfriend. That I had was been. So i've been. i've been talking to Ben. This like catching up with him for a while and he his mom has always been a big part of my life, ever since I met her too because she's the same."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
15841.0,Patient,which I think is really strange like both the boyfriends that i've had had really good relationship with their mom.
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
15841.0,Patient,"Like was the most important person in their life basically like almost both both of them were pretty much single mothers, because my. Benz ben's dad completely abandoned him never was in his life at all, and then Greg oreos dad moved to a different city, and so they never see each other but they're still like involved with each other's lives. But his mom like basically primarily raised him and gave him his you know morals and stuff like that. And Ben was the same ben's mom. Is addicted to meth still like she's still she has to do it just to like basically be at her baseline. But she's functioning she's a functioning addict. meth addict and she. he's always known that to like cuz he's seen like pipes and things like that around the House and my. dad is also the same except he's not as. High functioning, I guess, like that is still homeless and like doesn't really have his life together but um but yeah, and so I related to because my mom is addicted to meth too and she's you know. But I always had so much respect for ben's mom because she I knew she struggled with that and yet she still works and still like is a single mother and I just don't understand how she's juggling all those things at once, like it. It. I don't know I try not to make it like. I try not to make it so that I see my mom like. In a in a lower light or anything like that, because of the way that she chose to handle her um well that's a hard thing to say, too, because I don't even feel like she chose to have any of these issues she just had a really fucked up life but um. But I don't know I just I never like was able to grasp how somebody could be a teen mom. be abandoned by the father of the child and then have to raise the kid on your own. While you're. going to college and then have a full time job and also be addicted to meth like that just I don't like. I don't understand what she does."
759.0,Provider,yeah that happened yeah.
15841.0,Patient,"And she's like a good to the really good mom to like she's really wise and she's. Like. she's never the kind of person that you think struggles that much with with those issues but she's so like calm and level headed and like um doesn't anger easily and she always has the best advice and she's always so accepting and caring and loving and giving and. Like just everything I would ever want to be, you know what I mean. And so yeah that's why i'm trying to that's why i'm really like try to be conscious of my wording when I talk about people who struggle with addiction, because I feel like. People don't think about people like that, when they talk about addiction, they think they just think like you know, basically, like the first thing that comes to their mind is like a junkie. Exactly and I don't even like saying words like that. angels derogatory."
759.0,Provider,"stigma, you know they have a loss statement or something you know."
15841.0,Patient,yeah.
759.0,Provider,"Some loan to struggle with addictions, you need a junkie or addict or wherever you say yeah."
15841.0,Patient,"yeah and I feel like there are a lot of people who. who struggle with addiction, that are not really what I would consider a good person, you know there's people who lie and steal. From their family and. Use people just. Because they need to use drugs and. even kill people whatever but it's like it's not just one kind of person that struggles with addiction and that proofs that should be proof to me at least that it's not a choice it's definitely a disease that is not. You know it's not just like Oh, I guess, I don't want to be addicted to meth anymore like really."
759.0,Provider,yeah. It doesn't happen that way you.
15841.0,Patient,"know at all that doesn't. And I don't feel like I don't feel like we ever have a choice in it, I feel like. If if your parents or one of your parents, especially your mother is an addict. I feel like you're it's like a crazy number or something like like 200 times more likely to be an addict. um if your mother struggles with that and I don't feel like I ever had a choice in it either, I feel like i've always struggled with addiction, since I was little. Whether it was like food or you know, a person or toys like it was like not the same as drug addiction, but it's like i've always had addictive like. behavior behaviors. yeah yeah and I don't feel like that was ever a choice you know because I watched like what alcohol did to my mother I watched what how much like you know i've learned all about what cigarettes do to you. And i'm still addicted to nicotine, I still drink, you know i'm not like an excessive drinker. But I do feel like I always have to keep an eye on that because it scares me. Well, my mother went through you know and. watching her struggle with like math and prescription pills, and things like that, and I still ended up doing cocaine all the time. You know. And without my friends, I probably would I would have a hard time being sober from that. yeah you know, like it's really hard and it's not hard anymore I don't I don't have any desire to do hard drugs anymore, but i'm because i'm just really i'm really happy with the way my life's going but."
759.0,Provider,"yeah why you know put drugs in a fee, are we happy with the way things are going."
15841.0,Patient,"Well, and even if I wasn't happy with the way my life was going because honestly the past year I wasn't happy at all, but I still didn't have any kind of urge to do those things. You know. I just I don't I don't know I I had such horrible experiences, when I was going through that time in my life that I just feel like. I learned my lesson I guess you know, in a rough way in a dramatic way, but I learned my lesson and yeah I don't know it's hard though addiction is really hard, but the only thing I really struggle with now is the nicotine it's really hard to cake, I tried and."
759.0,Provider,was impossible.
15841.0,Patient,Most I say.
759.0,Provider,"yeah like you know you have to pay attention to your thoughts, you know you can do that if that's what you want to do. You know, it does take a long while, and sometimes people say like nicotine is more addictive than heroin, you know, like it's just really addictive, you know so."
15841.0,Patient,"yeah and it's it's so easy to because it's so accessible and it's so it's like. I still feel like it's very much glorified and and promoted and media in the media, and you know and like when I was growing up, like all the coolest characters and all the TV shows smoke cigarettes and. yeah like all my favorite artists smoked and did cocaine and I was like it's they're doing it and they're so cool it's fine if I do it like. Not fine. But I don't know that's not really something that's not really like at the top of my priority list right now."
759.0,Provider,"about that at another time right, you know I. can always revisit it yeah."
15841.0,Patient,yeah one day.
759.0,Provider,"You know, like between breaking up in for X, I know that you know was highly are not highly emotional here and there, you know, for you and you do not how has your mean Ben this last week."
15841.0,Patient,really good. yeah.
759.0,Provider,i'll go with the eggs I just good.
15841.0,Patient,at it. I know I feel kind of guilty admitting it but not really because it needed to happen and it just happened.
759.0,Provider,"So, like it needs to happen it's been a whole year in the making right."
15841.0,Patient,"yeah and i'm I was just thinking earlier, I was like. When I was like 18 I had the goal to be living on my own and by the time I was 21. I actually."
759.0,Provider,"yeah fine. Yes. that's awesome goal to have you know not to me 21 year olds are living by themselves, you know, like without the help of a parent or school or something of that nature but you're doing it. Which is nice now."
15841.0,Patient,"I never really thought it was actually going to happen. And I thought, if it did happen, it would have to be with my boyfriend and I was at a certain place that did seem ideal. For us to have our own place but I don't know i'm glad that didn't end up happening because that would have been away for a SEC."
759.0,Provider,yeah having him to move out there you have to move out yeah that would have been a lot more Messier like you said.
15841.0,Patient,"Especially having to find the housing during coven and everything and trying to find a new job. i'm sure I would have had we both would have had help with it, but. i'm just glad i'm just glad we don't have a baby i'm just glad we don't have a House together i'm just glad. It worked out."
759.0,Provider,Is you know.
15841.0,Patient,"yeah and I truly like wish the best for him, I want him to go like out in the world and, like go experience some crazy stuff or. Whatever he wants to do I want him to go do it and stop worrying about me because I really feel like. I don't know I one of my it's crazy, because one of my other friends is actually in a relationship like this right now and i'm trying to talk him through it and be encouraging of all his decisions but i'm also trying to support like autonomy. And it's. Hard because I don't want to like push them in one direction or the other. yeah, but I also like I also want him to have that push you know what I mean."
759.0,Provider,yeah.
15841.0,Patient,"cuz he lives with his partner too and it's it's really hard because she's super like. Lets her anxiety control all her decisions doesn't doesn't allow her to work, I mean her and she has like resistant treatment resistant depression. So, like she had she doesn't hadn't had any luck with medication or therapy. She pretty much relies on him for."
759.0,Provider,Everything.
15841.0,Patient,"You know, like she'll not leave the House for days she'll wait until he comes home to leave the House to eat and just go to the grocery store like doesn't really drive she had a car, I don't know if she's still has she had a car, and she never drove it. Just like how my boyfriend had a card he never drove it because he was just so scared. it's really hard to not feel frustrated in that situation. yeah even though you feel bad for your partner and you want to support them. But it gets to a point where you feel like you're really just enrolling them."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
15841.0,Patient,"You know, because. I don't know if, like exposure therapy is like necessarily it's not really like a medical term, but I think of it as like. If I don't know it's hard, because some people have like truly debilitating anxiety and I understand that, but at the same time, I feel like it gets to you know you're you're almost 21 are you already are 21 and you still are not like moving in. Any direction that's dangerous I mean at that point, like it's a cycle it's a cycle, where you're not leaving the House because you're anxious and then because you're anxious you're not leaving the House and then. You know you feel anxious, because your partner leaves the House, and then it makes you not want to leave the House even more, and then it just it's it's not a good."
759.0,Provider,cycle yeah.
15841.0,Patient,"And I feel like sometimes in those situations, the person who's really struggling with that anxiety needs to be. kind of honestly just left to their own devices, I mean, as long as they have like a friend there to support them, or something but. Sorry, like the hungry burbs but as long as you're there to like support. or they have someone to support them and, like make sure that they're safe and not going to like self harm. uh huh I feel like they need that exposure to being alone um and realizing that they're not going to die if their partners, not with them, you know what I mean because I felt like they really feel like that they really feel like. Their world is ending if their partner is not by their side 24 seven or their world is ending if their partner, all of a sudden doesn't love them anymore, and that is what it feels like for a moment. mm hmm but they have this idea that it's going to be like that forever and it's just not you know, and so I feel like if you distance from them things it might get worse, but if you break things off then they'll realize like maybe it'll take a month, maybe it'll take a year. yeah but they'll grow from it and they'll realize that they actually don't need. What they thought they needed they did they don't need to be constantly. Existing with another person to survive."
759.0,Provider,It sounds like very codependent.
15841.0,Patient,mean it's exactly what it is yeah.
759.0,Provider,yeah gives a their entire needs for the other person and yeah it also sounds like attachment style I think it's insecure attachment or i'm not too sure.
15841.0,Patient,I think there's an anxious one too.
759.0,Provider,yeah.
15841.0,Patient,"yeah but that's I I know what both ends are like now it's really kind of sad knowing what both sides are like, but I was like that with my. With my high school boyfriend and then I experienced what the what his side felt like being like. Having a walk on eggshells kind of and not in you're afraid to like do anything that you want to do because you're afraid of how your partner will feel about it, I was on both sides of it like and neither one is worse than the other they're both terrible. And I don't want either of those, but I feel like. i've grown, I feel like i've grown a lot in the past three years, to the point where I don't feel like I need anybody. You know, and if I want somebody that's great. But they have to be the same way that they're not like completely rely on me. To have fun or feel fulfilled, you know. yeah Of course I want them to be able to feel like they can rely on me and like they need me but. And I don't think there's anything wrong with meeting people I think it's a good thing to need people, and I think it's natural but I don't think i'm needing people in that kept away is good at all, especially when it starts to impede on both of your. psyches."
759.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
15841.0,Patient,cuz I you know you know for a while I started to really feel like.
759.0,Provider,"That you know. In the same predicament of being codependent and. And just realizing that well you can't you have come a long way, you know now you have realized the kind of different attachments and. What style works best for you in terms of you know, like being a secure relationship and you realize the last relationship that you're in. didn't have that security, you know wasn't two people you know, like take it takes two people to make the relationship work here, and for you guys to go together, but it just seemed like one person was just hot hot, it is growth, you know because he had you."
15841.0,Patient,know exactly.
759.0,Provider,You know so yeah I think you realizing that opinion perspective for yourself really does help. huh yeah.
