226.0,Provider,"yeah absolutely you did you did a great job to. You know you've done a really great job this month and we talked about how. You know this is a triggering month and how it's difficult and. You know, will be leading up to the anniversary date of the crime is also challenging and. You know you you didn't relapse."
11507.0,Patient,You know.
226.0,Provider,"Right you kept busy you talked about it, you know you talked about how you are feeling around all this. you've done a really, really great job."
11507.0,Patient,"yeah. I feel that i'm. criticizing myself. In my home myself man, not only for that, but one thing that I like i'm always double checking my email. i'm always. Trying to make. Sure everything looks good. So is that inside me is kind of has it all together the outside. Trying to have it all together, but inside if I. You know. or. If it's been worse or, if not all, you know put together, I still have her situation in my life, you know, besides mine."
226.0,Provider,yeah.
11507.0,Patient,Like the abuse. That I had sent me and by his father. abused by my mom went through. Now i'm. wrong. yeah I still got a lot of stuff. And the end side.
226.0,Provider,"And you know that's okay with Sean like I feel. You know we're all we're all we're humans right we're flawed or imperfect, we are. trying our best you know, there is no perfect in this world and perfect would actually probably be really boring. You know our. Our our flaws and our. quirks. Maybe make us who we are, as human beings, and that. enables us to. be able to. identify with other people to help other people to support other people to not feel so alone in our circumstances or situations. And also, only to realize that there are people that are here to help and that are willing to help and that. to feel sad and feel lonely is a human condition there's actually nothing wrong with that or just told that that's really bad doesn't feel so great, but the the reality, the reality is that it, it will pass. The feeling feeling lonely or sad is not a permanent state of being. it's part of the human condition. And then. And that's what makes you a really authentic person is that you're able to talk about it and you're really truthful and you're really honest about this and you know you're right experience there's a lot of trauma that happened. file to and growing up and. trauma also affects us greatly on many, many levels as a person, and then we grow and to adulthood, and we still have that trauma, we still have those scary. visions, if you will, you know or flashbacks are those scary feelings stay with us because they they just do look scary feeling that kind of like get wrapped up in ourselves just kind of stay there. And so, and you know, being able to identify that and talk about that is really, really good identified it and you can be honest about yeah this happened, then you can start to talk about it when you're ready to start talking about it. yeah because trauma trauma is something that it's a process when you start to. Talk to somebody about it, it comes out slowly kind of like drip drip drip drip. it's about like what you can really handle discussing like in that moment and that's okay and that's the way it should be, it should unfold. Okay, so. yeah. A lot a lot going on, when you're younger for sure. yeah yeah. Go ahead."
11507.0,Patient,"Through with has. It helped me a great deal. terrific admin time, yes it is faith and. process the ladder. Oh, oh. cuz in the hospital I had. Not everywhere out when they felt like."
226.0,Provider,there's.
11507.0,Patient,"A starfish everywhere, I know. I can kill I had. Always. offered me a hell. But you know, I think that goes behind it, but I don't always want to hide it. And I want to be where you are."
226.0,Provider,"and And you know it really sounds like you've got some good care when you were in the hospital like it didn't give you time you know it gave me some separation from your family gave you time to think about things and to reflect on things, and it gave you. It gave you that time. That you needed to really work on yourself and. be able to talk to somebody when you felt like talking to somebody so. It sounds like. It was a good, I mean i'm sure you would have rather not been in there, but it sounds like. You know, but. yeah you know, but it sounds like here's the deal is that I really feel that you made the best of it."
11507.0,Patient,yeah.
226.0,Provider,"You really you turn that that tragedy that that event into something like okay how, how can I change, how can I learn from this, how can I do things differently and to be able to do that with Sean takes a lot of inner strength. That you have, and a lot of discipline."
11507.0,Patient,yeah.
226.0,Provider,"You know, and so coming out of the hospital like now you're getting the care that you need to get and the support that you need to have, and you know. yeah I think there's always the quality of like we want, we want the world to see us as Co i'm really happy or i'm all i'm really funny and Oh, you know nothing really bothers me, you know that's that's the face, we put out to the world. And you know, but in reality we're going to have days, where we're like oh wow I don't like being really happy right now. yeah I just need to speak my truth to people know that yeah i'm not perfect, and I really have that these two even though voicing really happy yeah I can get really sad yeah."
11507.0,Patient,that's the balance of life.
226.0,Provider,"You know. And and there's nothing wrong with that, like that's really remarkable. Because it's super hard it's super hard to be happy, all the time. I mean. You know, we try right we're gonna have bad days okay. yep that days. I can, I encourage you. You know, talking about your bad days or how you're feeling, you know when you're not feeling so great um. what's the doctor's name, again, I can never remember her name. she's awesome. yeah she's got she's awesome so Dr windies really, really great because you know we talked briefly and we got a doctor when you've got Dr wendy's got bright heart, you know you've got school look at all the stuff you're doing wow oh good you got a tutor. you're trying like you're doing."
11507.0,Patient,Really really well.

226.0,Provider,"Okay, you know that's Okay, because you know here's here's my thinking. Is that you've been with that. doctor for a while, so they really know the history, and so I think that that's actually smart to stay with somebody that you've worked with for a long time because they're really familiar. they're familiar with you they're familiar with the. You know the background and all that stuff so you don't have to start all over with somebody else. weird you know. And then, if they change some stuff up and Mike at. This point let's just like keep everything. Where it. Is because it's working okay. Okay okay so talk to me about what you, what do you. got going on."
