16068.0,Patient,"yep and I think I need to go to an outpatient programs, and I was going to call insurance this morning, but I wanted to talk to you because I can't go into a full time 30 day program an outpatient program would be better for my schedule, the only difference. Is I wouldn't be able to talk to. You as much. But the can you find one for me, or should I pay for insurance."
740.0,Provider,I can't actually talk to a case manager department and let them know.
16068.0,Patient,"yeah because I took that a blood test and the thyroid tests and I called the, the body place the. Sun abella so I can get. You know what do they call it liposuction and I was going to sell stock to pay for it, which I shouldn't but they said I can't have it because I had a stroke. And now i'm stuck with this fat body and I don't know how to get it off the zombies dialing things that cardiologist told me about working. said that you cannot be on blood thinner. So I found it down by Dr pepper golf blood Center and then they said, I called fast, and I said log off book there for 30 days. And then he said well you can't have a stroke within five years. Of the. assumption it's affect your health. So I just oh what am I going to do with this fat body. I can't stand it is they can be soup is. Then I bring the catch me and then I get into a ball. that's why I thought, maybe I should go to an outreach program is I just lay here all day I don't have much to do. I want to go back to work, I think, maybe in January i'll try but. I can't lift i'm a caregiver for seniors I can't lift a lot and I can only walk for about 10 minutes until I exhausted because of my leg. it's not I don't watch. A walk with a limp still I have a brace for my legs. I thought i'd get liposuction with that saw the stock and get liposuction give all this fat of me. But i've been doing the cardiologist three months is go said to eat every three hours and I eat protein and vegetables. And I drink low calorie like. i'm still not losing weight."

Last Friday night we went up to Barnes and Nobles my daughter had to go and we walked around, and then we were standing there looking at stuff I couldn't even stand up, I had to go sit down.

16068.0,Patient,"i'm sure through medical they'll be an outpatient call program it'll give me something you do every day. and get me thinking about stopping. is really hurting my kids. Every Sunday, when I go to church I cried the whole time. Because i'm so guilty. i'm sure there's some sort of outreach or program with your insurance."
740.0,Provider,yeah just a. So okay.
16068.0,Patient,"My dog. My dog.

She has to do, online schooling and it turns out that she's got extreme anxiety and it's causing all these tremors and malformation. And then. We go. When she catches me with alcohol or cigarettes or beta really it just is causing the tremors so my fault."
740.0,Provider,yeah.
16068.0,Patient,she's gonna do our main scope. He watches me like a Hawk. And really.

740.0,Provider,"yeah and sometimes without situation, we could just take you over the age based off of those those that you are going through."
16068.0,Patient,"It says, I kept texting my best friend my best friend telling her what's wrong and she said what's wrong and there was too many things, the West. And I told her, I was gonna talk to you for. This think radio is for me to go into these programs. All day. To get me out of this House, because I have a lot of energy and up climbing the walls that I, my energy is getting I thought it I have so much i've always had so much late years since I got out of the hospital in February."
740.0,Provider,So why should we start.
16068.0,Patient,Where should we start.
740.0,Provider,"So much on me every so I mean this one, you want to start with her."
16068.0,Patient,"Well, I think I did this stuff first."
740.0,Provider,"absolutely agree. But see the thing about it is, is a. sense you don't feel good about yourself at this moment, then it seems like the outlet that you choose the time to is drinking. Yes, and the crazy part about it is it's not about the color I mean the the diet and things like that, I mean my My suggestion would be to actually go to a nutritionist so you can find out how to efficiently lose weight, even though you can't be mobile well."
16068.0,Patient,"That might be a good idea, because the cardiologist the heart doctor."
740.0,Provider,told me to.
16068.0,Patient,"eat every three hours intermittent fasting. which has been doing, but it doesn't help when I drink. This is that much I just eat vegetables and proteins there's just that much more calories On top of that. yeah and that doesn't seem to matter he says, the only thing that makes me get out of my misery."
740.0,Provider,"that's the that's the thing and so that's that's what I would suggest, for them, because and the crazy part about it is when we get if we get older, you know i'm saying this stuff they will help us lose weight back in our 20s and teens we can they don't work."
16068.0,Patient,And we know the.
740.0,Provider,"And because of the fact that your body went through so much. You know, recently with the stroke and days within Nigeria and and other medical I mean medical issues you got going on, maybe the best thing, since you have that as an option is to actually booked an appointment with a nutritionist. To go back and tell you how you should eat so they can appropriately be able to lose weight. I know you think I know, sometimes you know we try to do it on our own, but when is not working, then we should speak up, we should seek help from people who qualify."
16068.0,Patient,yeah i'll go to my regular PCP and have him refer.
740.0,Provider,"Nutrition is because what. yeah they'll take your way they'll take your BMI they'll take your blood pick all the piping, and then they'll be able to fit you on a meal plan from there."
16068.0,Patient,"Okay, so what the Cardio the heart doctor with every three our eating is not working so we'll go to the nutritionist now. Okay, and then and then also look into a ci called the mental health line for cal optima and get a referral for alcohol outpatient program, but could you guys find one there should I go through insurance."
740.0,Provider,"know they send it to me. So do you want I O P for for alcoholism, what do you want iot for mental health."
16068.0,Patient,outcomes.
740.0,Provider,"Alright, they said they're gonna they're gonna look into it and they'll update me as soon as possible. Okay um."
16068.0,Patient,"And then, could you email me or text me or something."
740.0,Provider,"yeah they'll let you know. Okay yeah they have your information so so yeah so we we do the nutrition find out that I mean going through the nutrition, with that in mind, did that just kind of help give you a better perspective of how you should eat in the things you should have stay away from."
16068.0,Patient,"Okay yeah. Oh, that but but, and I know what to eat because i'm a recovering anorexic person I know to eat, vegetables and protein and that will keep me healthy but it's the drinking that's causing the weight, not to fall off."
740.0,Provider,huh yeah yes that's true.
16068.0,Patient,And the nutritionist will say no alcohol.
740.0,Provider,yeah so that's why you need to do. yeah it was all you need to go.
16068.0,Patient,"it's just like back when I was at a I have a sponsor that also had an eating disorder and she put me on a meal plan and she said parties meal plan is not drinking, so you go on the fan to eat, which I could barely eat, but she told me too, but I didn't drink."
740.0,Provider,"I think that's the thing, and you know and the crazy part about it is you know fruits and veggies too much about both of those carbs. So yeah much it too much of it is still. You know i'm saying you want to make sure that you have an actual balanced diet. You know, like protein things of that nature, you know i'm saying and so like even with certain fruit, you know you can have some fruit fruit is high in sugar and high and costs."
16068.0,Patient,yeah I don't eat too many fruits by eat lettuce and my eat protein vegan protein vegan protein is that's trouble protein.
740.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16068.0,Patient,that's pretty much all I needed. I don't.
740.0,Provider,"Know maybe you need some more. Definitely that's all you eating, then I mean that ain't enough."
16068.0,Patient,yeah never not losing weight.

16068.0,Patient,If it's not enough you can't lose weight.
740.0,Provider,"No, because your body goes into starvation mode and began. To harbor everything that you eat they grab hold to it in fairness to say."
16068.0,Patient,yeah see I was anorexic and I wait double what I will I weighed 80 pounds for eight years and I weighed double that I would more than double what I used to way and I really screwed up my metabolism by starving and.
740.0,Provider,"Then yeah that doesn't mean you can't regulate the game, but because of the fact that you did go through the the process. You know i'm saying, and like you said, as you get older you're and you're not as active your metabolism slows down, but it is true, we any rest and stuff like that you can you know you can mess up something that's Why would say you to go to a nutritionist because I don't know nothing. Okay, it goes to the nutrition is so they can actually give you a full breakdown of what you need to do and how you need to eat, how many calories you need to consume per day out, it kind of stuff."
16068.0,Patient,"Okay, now, what about the mental health phone number on my insurance card they don't deal with nutritionist do they."
740.0,Provider,"Know yeah well you know what because miss so so broadly bear bear she includes eating disorders and mental health, so you can call them a little rough. yeah they have anything."

But now two or more things I just lose it, I was crying my husband was here that gives rear I kept crying I said. Whatever i'm doing isn't good enough for anybody, and I was like I gotta check it out, I got kicked out and they're like they then I walked out to go buy cigarettes and they came back them they got all mad because about cigarettes."
740.0,Provider,"Sometimes you can sometimes you can hinder your own healing. By consuming thing that are not conducive to healing. And so you drank any you smoking, or you just had a stroke."

740.0,Provider,You will be.
16068.0,Patient,I know your. Temporary right now it's also.
740.0,Provider,"I know, right now, it just seemed like it seems like you say you know there's you can see a way out a lot of times you can grieve. You can actually grieve the things that you used to be able to do, and now you can do them anymore, so you know that doesn't feel good either, and so we're just one of those things it's just one of those things that you have to be patient with yourself, and you know, a you have to be. Okay, with not being able to do as much as you used to do, but at the same time you're still able to do something."
16068.0,Patient,"Right. i'm right not being able to do what I used to do, but every once in a while I just feel so cooped up like a chicken in a cage. i'm in a cage but there's a refrigerator right there in the Bible line right there."
740.0,Provider,yeah.
16068.0,Patient,"And that's scary. Absolutely, I live for like 20 years and houses in college, with no food, and now I have a refrigerator full of food, a cupboard full of food and I don't eat it it just scares me. You know that's the emmerich free and I eat the salad the vegetables and the vegan protein. But the rest of the food scares me it feels like it's poison."
740.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16068.0,Patient,it's just scary. I have to provide for my kids.
740.0,Provider,"So when you call your insurance tomorrow. yeah see if you qualify for. The eating disorder Program. Because I know. Here the assurances, you have here we've tried to get you in but it wouldn't be the insurance that you have wouldn't. Do for here, but we implement the health office tomorrow and see if they would what are their options for eating disorder Program."
16068.0,Patient,Okay yeah i'll ask for that first. yeah and then maybe an outpatient Program.
740.0,Provider,And then we eating disorder they actually give you a nutritionist.
16068.0,Patient,"Oh good yeah and then, if that doesn't work out i'll ask her a oops. i'm on the low battery are you there. Oh i'm a low battery my phone just tell me. And then i'll ask her outpatient alcohol program outpatient eating disorder program but usually with he didn't sort of program they want you hospitalized they want you in patient."
740.0,Provider,well.
16068.0,Patient,I don't know what.
740.0,Provider,To do.
16068.0,Patient,"I got to talk to my husband about that cuz I don't know who's gonna run the household. yeah because, at least when I had a stroke, and I was in the hospital, they could bring me the bills and I could handle the bills and the."
740.0,Provider,"won't just be free, if they have one for outpatient I mean treatment has has definitely evolved over the years. Right, they may they may have one for outpatient. But my thing is like this. The starving yourself, when you were 20. and starving yourself a very old age it."
16068.0,Patient,yeah I did.
740.0,Provider,You won't get the same result.
16068.0,Patient,"I did from 14 to 38 and then after I had my baby, I still cut back on everything I was assigned 01 and I still was them and then since the stroke i'm a one excel."
740.0,Provider,"yeah and so now. Good. You know, and so your idea is Oh, I can lose i'm just gonna starve myself and just kind of eat like a rabbit."
16068.0,Patient,"that's, the only way I know how to eat to lose weight before I would meet for five days straight and I need on the weekends solid, but now it's every day, I have to eat local stuff."
740.0,Provider,"yeah. But even still you just you need you know you need more, you need more help."
16068.0,Patient,yeah.
740.0,Provider,"I do right, and so, because food is not poisonous but you look at it that way, because of course of your history. yeah and so, but the thing about it is food actually came. The right type of food can actually help you lose weight. yeah right but."
16068.0,Patient,vegetables and protein that help you lose weight. Oh.
740.0,Provider,"Because even with vegetables vegetables are carbs. You know, the more you have a bad. No."
16068.0,Patient,Okay i'll see the nutritionist. I want to.
740.0,Provider,"I want you to do. become. It becomes necessary um you know I you know I definitely empathize with you in regards to IP here you very here you have saved and really emotional thing like that, and you know, in times like these we gotta get you some resources to help you."
16068.0,Patient,"yeah i've been on the phone every morning with insurance trying to find counselors for my daughter. Her anxiety is. is causing her seizures or. tremors provoking the malformation, and so this morning, I thought I better call for myself, but then I thought i'll talk to you first. So you'll try to find some resources and i'll try to find some. Resources in the morning."
740.0,Provider,"wow that they're already looking for your I O P, for your test with abuse. Okay, so I sent them there. And then, basically, you have to find it for your."

740.0,Provider,"yeah well, the thing about it is you know and and the fact that you have to look at the same coin right with you, not just always focusing on the stuff is going wrong."
16068.0,Patient,"I know I know I have to look at when you know people point out to me when they see me the dentist yesterday or the church Members how I achieved so much first time they met you know within their wheelchair. And now i'm walking and i'm serving and i'm doing everything i'm supposed to do, but i'm so guilt ridden. But I don't tell them i'm ashamed like it's really hard for me to tell them, I can tell you guys, but I it's hard for me to share this at church."
740.0,Provider,"It can be really, really difficult because you know, fear of being judged and condemned, and all that kind of stuff. yeah. yeah no. But in seasons, like in until we're able to at least get you into somewhere. yeah and the thing that I would challenge you to do. really is to be able to focus on things that are going on right positive things that are going right with you, you know. Some people who have strokes, you know i'm saying don't have any uses can be to end up being paralyzed and location you got full usually used to stay a walk in our fair lies. You might feel work so so you know, saying that the fear happening as good in your life."
