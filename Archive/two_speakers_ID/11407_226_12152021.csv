11407.0,Patient,Hello.
226.0,Provider,How are you.
11407.0,Patient,hanging in there.
226.0,Provider,yeah I mean.
11407.0,Patient,"it's like I have really bad service because i'm at work, so, for some reason. The services is really bad today."
226.0,Provider,"All right, how's everything going so man."
11407.0,Patient,"nothing's changed he's still gone he hasn't returned, thank goodness, he called i've only talked to him once since the last time we've talked and he just called to kind of check up on Max talk about some bills or do. It was really nice the whole phone call, but other than that, like nothing there's not really an update just been working. Max has been sick he apparently has a swollen lymph node in his neck, so he has like a golf ball sized swollen lymph node. So he was sick for like four days, so I had to take off work. So my leave is like all messed up and it's just stressing me out, but other than that everything else has been pretty good he hasn't been back, which is great, and he doesn't seem like he's going to be back before the holidays so. Which is okay with me. Like me, and Max are doing great we're having fun and like just Max just cut his two front teeth, so he has to front top and to front bottom."
226.0,Provider,"Oh, my God I want like a little rabbit the one that's creating the. issue with it is. yeah yeah."
11407.0,Patient,"yeah yeah that's what the doctor said they just wanted to make sure that it wasn't infected and it's not it's just swollen and so he's on 10 days worth of antibiotics, hopefully, you know after the 10 days it'll kind of clear it up and he'll be alright so we'll see."
226.0,Provider,Okay okay.
11407.0,Patient,"But, everything else is the same my mom she's good she's finally out of the icu she's home resting and just waiting till January, when she starts her chemo. And everything else is just kind of the same no big changes, yet I missed my last group which, last Friday, because of Max being super sick. We were actually admitted into the hospital because they thought he had the infected month no but it turned out it wasn't affected they. assumed, it was an abscess because of the size, because it was it was literally the size of a larger golf ball, it was humongous. Why he looked like a Frankenstein baby. It was it was. crazy scary it was like bigger than an egg it was humongous on his neck. Now it's probably the size of the large gumball or Joel breaker so it's still pretty big but it's not as hard and it's not as red or or painful for him. But we were admitted into the hospital, so I didn't have any service at all, and I was so worried and stressed about Max I completely just. By the time I remembered oh shoot I have group, it was already like 20 minutes in. And they wouldn't let me in the room, so I was like. yeah okay well guess i'm missing this."
226.0,Provider,"So, are you Okay, on your medication now."
11407.0,Patient,"yeah i'm Okay, and because Dr factor literally had just filled it last week so Oh, and he did 30 days but. yeah i'm okay on meds. it's funny because. They were supposed to fill it the last group and, apparently, they said that it was too early to fail, but I had to wait until Monday, which was only three days right. So I was like that's fine. I forgot on Monday to get it filled I forgot Tuesday to get a bill I forgot on Wednesday to get it. But I still had medication, so I wasn't thinking about it. So, on the day that I was supposed to fill it, I still had six pills from the previous prescription. I guess at some point I got too busy, and just wasn't taking my meds like i'm supposed to but I wasn't experiencing any withdrawal symptoms, or anything like it like I was good, without it, so i'm like this is amazing. i'm going to continue to try to do this, that way I can take her down."
226.0,Provider,"So I was really surprised, so how much, are you taking. How much are you taking i'm okay Have you taken down. Have a tapered at all."
11407.0,Patient,"Just once. Okay, so one. Time. I haven't tapered since then, because I had hurt my arm and I had to wear that stupid things i've messed up my wrist and whatever but. Now. I haven't tapered since then."
226.0,Provider,"Okay, so what are you taking right now. How much."
11407.0,Patient,"I take three a day. Three a day I don't know the milligrams off top of my head i'd have to look at the bottle which I don't I was looking to see if I had it with me but it's in the office, but I take three days I took one of the morning one in the afternoon and one before bed. That I i'm pretty sure that i'm forgetting sometimes the one before bed, and the reason I think that's the one it is because a few times i've woken up and i'm like really sweaty at night. to wear have to like change my clothes and i'm thinking that's like a sign of withdrawal symptoms but it's not bothering me enough to have to take anything, and then I just get up in the morning and take the one in the morning. So I think that's why I had that. couple days of extra bills."
226.0,Provider,yeah totally that's probably what happens yeah so that is.
11407.0,Patient,"What is good, though."
226.0,Provider,Right yeah so that is one of the effects that you will have you'll get to sweat.
11407.0,Patient,"But that's okay yeah basically, though. i'm okay with that it's the rest of slides that is going to get me."
226.0,Provider,"yeah right. Or, just like the even Nada you know, like the shaking and the knowledge is what people can dial damn you know that's hard pursuing."
11407.0,Patient,"The only thing that that. The parts that I can't handle is just the restless legs. All the other stuff like the diarrhea the sweaty the. Little bitty shapes and stuff that you get in your hands and stuff I don't care about any of that it's the Russell flakes that gets me. Because it is so since I already have it before medication before this intensified it. And I had already had it, which is crazy, because I was on real quick for it, which helps tremendously, but you can't take that and take the suboxone so i'm like really nervous when I start to completely taper off this because I can't combine the two. So i'm going to have to feel that's, the only thing that i'm fearful of but that's Okay, whatever I mean. This is how I have to look at it, when I do start to taper down before I get completely off of it is my baby. had to suffer because he had withdrawal symptoms, because of the medication that they put me on he didn't get suboxone yeah and he fought through it and if my baby can do it and. His little bitty tiny body this big girl better be oh. yeah so. And that's, the only thing that keeps me like you know I know you can do it, you just got to do it."
226.0,Provider,"yeah absolutely absolutely yeah. yeah and and just like knowing that you're going to be okay, you know that it's fine it's going to pass it's not forever."
11407.0,Patient,yeah.
226.0,Provider,"I think, because what happens is that feeling gets so overwhelming and get scared like this is never going to go away brings back a lot of memories for people, you know those. memories and so. Are you wanting to try and taper after the holidays. be thought about that at all."
11407.0,Patient,"So what I was going to do is this prescription that I currently have, I actually haven't even opened the bottle yet cuz I still have pills left. I think I have two left. So I probably won't open it until tomorrow morning, if not later tonight, because I have two left, I think, oh wait so tomorrow morning because it'll be this afternoon tonight so i'll probably open it tomorrow and i'm just going to try to do the two a day or two and a half a day. Just to see. You know what I can get away with as far as you know what i'm comfortable with. And I even thought about doing like one and a half a day like doing a half in the morning, a half in the afternoon and a half at night. To see how. My body would react plenty of meds to cover it if I need to take one I can take it. So i'm thinking about doing that just. To kind of gauge where i'm at so that after the holidays, I can decide how like what's the best step, I need to take as far as coming down. Because it's time it's time to come down my wrist is healed my arm is healed it's time to come down some like regardless, even if it's a half a pill, I have to come down some because I don't want to be on this meds forever so. i'm just going to play with this prescription and see how my body feels based off of here and there. and go go from there, basically."
226.0,Provider,"Okay, all right good."
11407.0,Patient,we'll see.
226.0,Provider,"Okay, so it doesn't look like your husband will be home for the holidays so. Not just to he'll be back."
11407.0,Patient,On the 18th.
226.0,Provider,"of January. it's not a for sure, does that mean."
11407.0,Patient,"it's a tentative so anywhere between the 15th and the 20th but they told us that he is approximately when he'll be home. But it would be between the 15th and the 20th is what they were telling us so it's an approximate date unless it gets extended again and then that he won't but as of right now that's the date that they were giving everybody. All right, so, which is fine yeah. glad."
226.0,Provider,Where.
11407.0,Patient,Are the long as you'd like.
226.0,Provider,yeah okay so. it's just.
11407.0,Patient,You know the plan is. i'm gonna try. Oh i'm sorry.
226.0,Provider,No go ahead.
11407.0,Patient,"So the plan is i'm hoping that my settlement will be here before he gets back because it was supposed to be here last week and it's still not here. And I messaged the Attorney yesterday, and she hasn't responded yet after she kept saying oh it's going to be here in that you know, last week it's going to be here to here, and then it didn't show up. So I messaged her yesterday, she hasn't responded yet, but i'm hoping, she will eventually and if the money gets here before he returns i'm going to try to get at least a cash vehicle. And then I may have my sister fly up here and then drive back with me to go stay with my parents for a little bit because you know I want to see my mom and my son hasn't met you know my mom in person, so i'm hoping, I can do that and be gone before he gets home. Just for a little bit not permanently just until you know just for a little vacation with my parents and my family. And then that way I can. decide if you know I want to move back to Florida. With Max or if I want to stay in California and if I do decide, I want to move back it'll give me some time to start applying for jobs, while i'm there and looking for places to stay, etc."
226.0,Provider,"Okay, so. Okay, so but. Is this all contingent upon getting that settlement."
11407.0,Patient,"Yes, yeah if it if I don't get I mean I know i'm getting settlement that's that's a done deal i've already started that they work i'm just waiting for it to get here. The. thing that i'm you know just trying to decide is is if i'm going to stay here. Or am I going to go there, you know. there's going to be changed, regardless i'm not sticking around any longer, I did, however, just. kind of divulged some of this information to my boss, finally, because it was affecting my work because it's always me having to take off work for Max. And he finally asked me, you know, like, why do you always have to take off like distress and he knows Freddie. But he says, you know why do you always take off for doesn't Freddie ever take off and i'm like because he's not involved in. The hasn't been involved since Max been born and he's like what he's like I was wondering, you know what's going on, because it seems like every time Max is sick, you have to be the one to take care of them."
226.0,Provider,And so.
11407.0,Patient,"I you know told him yeah well he's never around he doesn't care enough to want to be around and so he was like you know you should just call this first shirt. And force him to help with Max and force him and that they are be. Because being in the military that's one good thing that you can do you can't force him to step up and be the right kind of person and i'm like you know, the only thing is, is I don't want to affect. Our livelihood like what if they were to kick him out that doesn't just affect him, it affects me Max too, and he replied, you know they're not going to kick him out for that, if anything, they were forced me to go to therapy and get some help and get his mind right and i'm like you know. that's a good thought that, at the same time, you know I don't want to affect his career, to the point that expects me and Max his livelihood. But you know I have considered that to you know, maybe. forcing him to get some help against his will, but I don't know what i'm going to do yet. yeah, how do you think he would."
226.0,Provider,know if that's the right move or.
11407.0,Patient,"Not yeah howdy Oh, he would flip out because. He would flip out because i'm tarnishing his name. In the public to other people, and you know not just himself, but his culture. They are all about pride. You know, and if I take away his good name and the little face that he's built up that's not. A real face, you know it's like you know the worst case scenario, you know what I mean so it's like I don't know that i'm ready to do that yet. You know i'll talk to him when he gets back and i'll gauge and see you know because I don't want him to get better, for me, I want him to get better for our son because Max deserves a dad. And he deserves you know he deserves to be loved and you know have credit in his life, but I want the old Freddie I want the the original Freddie that wasn't. Such a piece of shit all the time, you know what I mean not the abusive jerk thinks that he's turned into and so it's like. I have thought about once he gets back actually sitting down and having a just regular conversation with him, you know, we had a little bit of a conversation. Over the phone recently this last conversation, he was being super nice of you know at the majority of the call. Until I started in on trying to talk to him about how I was feeling and how he's been acting and you know I made the comment like if you continue to just be ugly you know, we should get a divorce. You know what I mean."
226.0,Provider,Did I turn your about the detail.
11407.0,Patient,"The car detail. No okay. So right where he had left. was really sick Max fell asleep in the high chair, with a serial puff in his hand one little cereal. He fell asleep in the high chair Freddie came home from work and was rushing like we gotta go to the store we store you had to come with me bring Max let's go rushing rushing rushing. Max was in Athens sleeper it's literally raining and cold outside it's freezing it's almost you know nine o'clock at night everything's about to close. And he wants to rush to the store, so we get in the car we go to the store he's like well you run in because I want you to put it on your credit card, so you have to be the one to go in all keep Max in the car. So i'm like sure that's fine i'll go in, so I went to go into the store and as i'm getting out Max drops this little cereal puff on the floor, and it makes the funny tapping noise, because it hits plastic. So Freddie said what was that and I said oh I don't know so I look around, I find the Sierra club and i'm like Oh, it was a serial puff Max must have dropped it he had in his hand. And he was like Why is Max eating in my fucking car and he's like cussing and screaming about Max having food in the car. And i'm like he wasn't it was still in his hand from when he fell asleep in the high chair. he's like you're going to pay for my fucking detail you're going to pay $109 get this goddamn car detailed data and start screaming and yelling about the car getting filled. He said I pay for everything with this car well yeah you do because it's your fucking car so of course you should pay for everything. So he's screaming and yelling and he's like you know what just take Max into the store with you. And i'm like I don't want to get him out it's cold and it's raining and he's sick and he's in a thin sleeper and he's like take him I do so i'm like whatever so I get the stroller out of the trunk. I get Max out of the car and I the trunk is still open the car door is still open and i'm strapping Max into the stroller he drives away with the trunk. And the car door still open. Because he's got mad, so we go into the store I call him and i'm like Where are you going he said i'm going to go to the gym and burn this off give me 20 minutes i'll come back and gave you an hour and 15 minutes later he shows back up to get us. So he gets there and he's like let's go to the commissary real quick because they're closing and 20 minutes and i'm like Okay, so we go across the street, to the commissary. I go to get out he's like if you're not going to pay for my my detail, then you need to buy me some drinks like these bang drinks like energy drinks. I said I can't afford that there are $3 apiece and he was like I saw what you have in your bank, you can afford to buy at least seven of them blah blah blah i'm like, why are you checking my account. And he's like just go buy them and then I like screaming and yelling or you can pay for the hundred $90 detail and i'm like holy Lord God, here we go with this detail again, so I get out with Max we go into the store we get what we need, when we come out of the store freddie's gone. So I call him and i'm like Where are you. And he's like I went to go get the car detailed."
226.0,Provider,And i'm like that's going to take like two hours.
11407.0,Patient,What are we supposed to do and he's like we don't live far from home walk home my.
226.0,Provider,Mind you again.
11407.0,Patient,it's freezing cold i'm in pajamas because. We just rushed out of the House and maxes into thin sleeper so I took off my little skinny thin hoodie that I had on and covered Max as best as I could and walked home.
226.0,Provider,In the rain with my child.
11407.0,Patient,"This guy so that was that and then. The the last ish incident that happened right before he left, we had to go get diapers from target and. My check gets eaten up by daycare mostly or max's things that he needs diapers formula stuff like that, so we had to go to target because I had a diaper bag, I was going to return that got gift. gifted to us recently but Max is too old for that now like we're not going to use a little baby diaper bag. So I was like you know, let me return it's brand new and i'll put this towards diapers and it'll give me enough in my account to buy diapers and formula, so we go to target he bitched about going, but he took me to target it's raining. it's freezing cold we get there, he parked the car in the parking lot so me and Max get to walk in the rain, to the store because he wouldn't drop us off at the front seat said it's too crowded he didn't want the car to get hit. So me and Max go into the store we tried to return this diaper bag and they won't, let us. So i'm like that's okay I at least have enough money in my account to buy. diapers and formula, so I get the diapers the whites and the formula go to check out my car to car. And i'm like Why is my card declined. So I look at the Bank, he is then transferred $190. My bank. yeah so I call him and i'm like what and I start cussing him out and i'm like where's my money, what did you do, why did you do this, and he was like we're about to get money for the return, so why does it matter and i'm like because they wouldn't. return that so he puts the money back, so I can get the diapers and stuff but the point of him doing it in the first place is just like what the freak so I opened another bank. So that you can't get access to it at all. So you can't see the accounts, he can't touch see the accounts it's solely my name, which is the information i'd given to the Attorney for our for our settlement. So yeah he's a piece of work. He is he is a piece of work and it's just like. The he just doesn't click sometimes and it's just like he doesn't care about me he doesn't care about Max and it's. Just I don't know."
226.0,Provider,yeah. i'm.
11407.0,Patient,Over it i'm over all of it.
226.0,Provider,yeah mm hmm. Has he ever been on medication.
11407.0,Patient,"Yes, so originally right after MAC after alone, he passed away before max's conceived, he was on some kind of depression medicine, but it made him a zombie he was like a zombie like just. I don't know like a zombie he was just quiet didn't he just slept all the time, literally he slept all the time he didn't do anything they get off the couch or nothing you slept all the time. Okay yeah other than that no he's never been on anything."
226.0,Provider,"Alright well. Okay, so. Right so there's a game plan in place which is great okay. Yes. You know. Some of it might be subject to. Change that's Okay, too, you know just as long as you're safe and Max is safe and. You know. You get that money you'll get that settlement money, hopefully we'll get that soon. and"
11407.0,Patient,Then you can start planning. I hope so.
226.0,Provider,yeah why now because you can start to plan a little bit more after. You get that set on that.
11407.0,Patient,"yeah. yeah because my aunt who lives in Florida she needed reached out to me and was like. If you need to come here you just one call away i'll send you and Max a plane ticket immediately, so you know, we do have an option to go there, too, so we have two different parts of Florida, we could go to one where my mom is the one where my hand is. It would just ultimately be where would I want to go that would be the safest and the best place for that or do I want to stay here and, ultimately, the only thing that would keep me here is my job, because I do have a really great job, but I can get a really good job anywhere so. we'll just have to wait and see."
226.0,Provider,Well you've got you've got some. you've got a good option I.
11407.0,Patient,don't know I really want to just be closer to my mom.
226.0,Provider,yeah sure.
11407.0,Patient,sure.
226.0,Provider,we're here locally.
11407.0,Patient,"But I do have to cut it a little short. Though because. I am the only one here today and i'm working the front desk but. I definitely wanted to make sure that I talked to you and kind of gave you an update. I will be in we are having our thing Friday right there, please so Friday or no."
226.0,Provider,So yeah we're still having a group on Friday.
