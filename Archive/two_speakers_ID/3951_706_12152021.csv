3951.0,Patient,"Or that it doesn't take time, like the egg like you should I swear he acts like 8 million things should be able to be done in one day i'm like Do you understand how long it takes to do one load of laundry. from putting it in the washer to then putting it in the dryer. To then taking it out. folding it and putting it away, I mean one little laundry is like a two hour process."

3951.0,Patient,"Right, I know i'm like how am I going to finish. anything like I still have Christmas shopping to do, I mean granted like their stuff is mostly done, which is fine, but now it's like I didn't have to and that's what he doesn't get to when you have to like drag the kids along with you. It takes even longer, and then they bitch and complain, the whole time and yeah. The lines in the stores are long the traffic is awful like."
706.0,Provider,I I don't leave my home.
3951.0,Patient,I don't want to.

706.0,Provider,"I hate hate hate, even going to the grocery store."
3951.0,Patient,I know.
706.0,Provider,We I mean I literally went to pick up our youngest from. His parents and I almost got hit three times because people just aren't paying attention it's like their heads in a totally different place and.
3951.0,Patient,So they're in such a hurry.
706.0,Provider,"yeah oh my gosh yeah no I try to stay home, I like working from home because I really don't have to leave for anything, besides going to the gym. The only thing I have to go to is is my my fitness class, I did not stay my happy bite at home."
3951.0,Patient,"mm hmm yeah we went to the it take the kids because my husband and get home from work last night, like eight o'clock. And I was missing like one thing for dinner last night, so we had to run to the grocery store, which is fine it's not that far from our House. But we literally had to wait in line in the self checkout line for 30 minutes. To check out at the grocery store. i'm like and all they sell is groceries it's not like it's a store like we can get other things that i'm like."
706.0,Provider,yeah I. and see and I have found to when you take kids to the store you tend to spend way more money because.
3951.0,Patient,They really.
706.0,Provider,"That and whatever and even my my three year old has caught on to like if I go to the grocery store, I will get something. And he's just gonna be three on Saturday he's already got so."
3951.0,Patient,"Every time we go to a store, can I get a toy, can I get a toy. and especially my daughter i'm like your birthday was five days will. Be Christmas is in 10 days you don't need any toys. you're going to be fine."
706.0,Provider,"And I I seriously doubt that they need need toys anyway. I know, when my people ask me what can I get them what do they need. They don't need nothing, nothing. They need nothing there is nothing I need you to build me an addition, on my house like in House all the things they have that they don't need. that's how we already have that they don't need they need nothing. grandparents are ridiculous."
3951.0,Patient,"they're the worst with it and they buy big shit like big things and i'm. Like there's no more room for big things like my mom last year, but my daughter, like the big car for like the American girl dolls like the big like jeep that the American girl dolls have and. We bought her like the Barbie you know the big Barbie house in between like even just those two things, and she has a big room, like her room is not small. There is not room for all these things, and then this year, she wants like the Lol dollhouse and i'm like if we buy you that house you're getting rid of the Barbie House because there's not room for both you can't have both."
706.0,Provider,Exactly.
3951.0,Patient,"yeah so yeah that's your thing I need to go through, like all their rooms like while they're at school and get rid of things. And it's like I have one more day to get that done."
706.0,Provider,"yeah I feel your pain that I need that want my 13 year old I don't even go in his room because half the time I can't see the floor, but my little guy have to go through his stuff because he has a pop control tower he does, like the full like three foot big is your child pop."
3951.0,Patient,up.
706.0,Provider,"But it's not the new one, so of course Graham has got to get the new one, so. Now we're gonna have to, because I know he's not if I take that out, he will have a fit with my pop actual tower. Not to and then she bought him this giant pj masks tower and it was like what do we need that he can't play with both is well if people you know, and I was like Okay, whatever like there's just so much stuff coming into this House, I feel stressful because I hate clutter. And he's. Like you're going to have stuff on top of stuff on top of stuff and then OCD is going to kick in and i'm going to be like. Okay, I organize this."
3951.0,Patient,"I lose that, so I am I won't even let my kids clean their own rooms, which is ridiculous, because they should, but it's because I want this stuff to go like. there's been like all the wall dolls going one been you know the princess's go in the other bit like I cannot have this stuff out of. Order like my husband will go in their room like clean it and he'll just like throw everything in bins and i'll go in and it will literally give me anxiety. yeah and I gotta dump it all out and then I got to fix it all and i'm like you're really not helping. you're not helping at all. you're making it we just have to read it, you know I."
706.0,Provider,"think that that is one thing with like people have like a type a personality and have to have everything kind of like how they want it, when people try and help them, they think it's helping but it's really causing more anxiety and they don't get that. Especially over thinkers because you'll literally sit and think about it over and over like my husband can go to bed and leave addition to think if I leave addition to saying I will lay in bed, and I will think about it. Like there is a there is a dirty dish amazing and you'll overthink it it's terrible but that's just how different people think. And you know. And it's just it's just that you know it's just that understanding, I guess that each person is different. But um no I feel yeah and there's there's toys there's so many like little things and they I put them all in like specific places too, but not my husband goes well. Suppose just going to dump them out all together anyway and i'm like that's not the point like they have specific you know, but now."
3951.0,Patient,It doesn't yeah.
706.0,Provider,You feel yeah I feel yeah so um so what's the situation with mom and dad has anything come up that.
3951.0,Patient,"No, we don't know I just kind of didn't talk about it again my husband went over there, because. Their dog got hit by a car."
706.0,Provider,Oh geez.
3951.0,Patient,"So my husband went over there, and he had to help my dad bury the dogs they didn't know what to do with it and. yeah so that was fun so and then we just had my daughter's birthday party. Last last weekend yeah just this past weekend and they came and they didn't I mean they just act like everything's fine. Is the race."
706.0,Provider,like an elephant in the room.
3951.0,Patient,"No, not really because at this point I just really don't care like I am so used to them acting like that the."
706.0,Provider,yeah.
3951.0,Patient,I just try not to let it bother me and gets me.
706.0,Provider,"Now I mean I understand what you're saying remember the last time we talked about like how your anxiety is so high, and maybe some of the reason is because of like your parents and how you grew up and the immense amount of pressure you constantly feel from them. And it might be, you know that you know that really is quite a bit and. The only way to kind of get rid of some of that is to just be like this is this is what's going on this is how I feel, and I know you say won't really do anything because they don't really hear you per se, but it might be something you know um. You know, just like like last time we talked about just writing that letter, not necessarily to give it to them. But just write yourself to just get it all out. You know about them interrupting or making you feel like you're being petty or unappreciative or we don't whatever it may be. Like you're not. Like all of those things that you've been feeling when you just write it in a letter and it's all out there, then it's out there."
3951.0,Patient,And then yeah.
706.0,Provider,"there's nobody that's can come back at you and say anything you're just allowed to express how you feel. And I think that's important because I feel like you've done your whole life what you're doing right now, this bothers me and it's not going to change was sweep it under the rug and keep on going."
3951.0,Patient,mm hmm.
706.0,Provider,So.
3951.0,Patient,But because there's no use talking to them because anytime that you like. I mean that's just what i've learned like as i've gotten older like if you don't agree with what they think like there's no talking to them like you'll either get screamed and yelled at told you're wrong like it's just not worth it it's not worth the extra anxiety to. And like. i'm emotional like if anybody like says any like yells at me like I start crying like you know the littlest thing will just like make me start crying like I cry over everything so yeah I just don't want to deal with it.
706.0,Provider,"Well, and that things it to. Well over emotional um so yeah and and and that's really unfortunate that you don't feel heard and that's why I said, you know just getting it all out for you yourself."
3951.0,Patient,Just being.
706.0,Provider,"Like literally sit down and just like basically word vomit on the paper all of the everything. Because what happens when you continually just push it under the rug and kind of move forward is pretty soon that mound under the rug is so big. You weren't gonna be able to move forward anymore, and then eventually it'll be like a blow up of some sort like you can only hold everything for so long. Like i'm sure you were feeling when they call call for your husband to come, help them, because in my head, I would have been like you want him to come help you you didn't even pay and the last time that he offered to help you, and now we had to pay for the paint like you didn't even. write guys you didn't even try and make amends, but now you want his help again like that's you know that's, the first thing somebody would think, but you don't say it, because you don't want to cause any friction. and your husband probably felt it. But didn't say anything because you don't want to cause any friction, but what happens is that friction and resentment is still there, even if it isn't brought to light and, eventually, it will surface and typically when that happens, it will be, not a pretty thing on either side. So i'm somehow you need to get it out and with therapy that's great because talking through it is able to get that out to. Because if you literally just kept it inside it just it would eat at you eat it you and eat it you. He so but it's good that you. Have the insight to know that this has happened, your whole life like this is not just something new, you have felt this way your whole life they've made they've made you feel. yeah adequate."
3951.0,Patient,"I think i've only realized that like recently, though, like you, would I mean like I don't think that like back when I was you know, a teenager whatever that that's what I thought or even in my early 20s. You know that's not what I thought, but. it's it's definitely something that i've come to the realization that my parents were the kind of parents that they threw money at everything. Like we always had everything that we wanted, we went on, you know. three, four or five vacations every single year, we had you know all the things that you know any kid would want and if anyone from the outside looking in looked at my childhood would say you have nothing to complain about you know, like you had everything that you wanted, but. they're just emotionless like my family doesn't hug each other, they don't tell each other, they love each other, like things like that, like they're just I don't know it's weird. So my brother and sister are just like my parents. So they all get along really well and so that's how like we're like outcasts you know what I mean like."
706.0,Provider,Are your siblings younger or older.
3951.0,Patient,younger okay.
706.0,Provider,"So um so they were like that from you all the way down to their their youngest and those your siblings I adapted that type of affection and parenting. Is man, the relationships that they sought out where they the same kind of thing like do they not show affection and love and."
3951.0,Patient,"My like my brother and sister. yeah yeah like like me and my husband like you know, like we hold hands like when we're in public like we sit next to each other, like we you know, whatever we flirt with each other, whatever you know, like we're very like. affectionate with each other, like my sister and her husband my brother and his wife, I can, especially my brother and his wife like. I just see my parents in them there's no affection there they fight with each other, they pick at each other, like to they seems to me they don't even like each other. But they'll never get divorced because that's not the thing to do, you don't get divorced you just don't do it, you know because that's what you know my parents. taught us, and I think that that's a lot of the thing, though, too, is because i've been divorced before and I was you know. Even though, in my you know first marriage like I was cheated on I was physically abused, I was mentally abused, I was still told to go to therapy and work it out, because divorce isn't an option."
706.0,Provider,"yeah, you said that he brought something like like. Like yeah."
3951.0,Patient,"enjoy do and you're tearing down the stairs yeah it's like Oh, you need to work this out. Because he's your husband. cheated on me the night of my wedding."
706.0,Provider,"yeah well and then you said to that you it's like keeping up with the joneses like they have to keep up appearances like. And you have to be this like perfect little whatever and so when your husband went to prison you broke that mold and so you were the black sheep of the family, I guess you would call it. yeah and that's a lot of pressure to take on um. You know, and especially when your other two siblings are quote unquote like the cookie cutter of what they want."
3951.0,Patient,They can't do any wrong.
706.0,Provider,"yeah and that's and that's terrible because I think they are doing wrong because they're teaching their children how to not be compassionate affectionate human beings, you should tell people you love them and hug them because you might ask them tomorrow. Exactly you gone. Right you don't want them dying wondering. How lovely they were you know, like."
3951.0,Patient,"And so that's. that's the thing too it's not only that they're not affectionate with their spouses, but they're not affectionate with their kids like. I got home, I still hold my kids. My kids are nine and six, you know I still carry my daughter around on my end it makes me emotional because I don't want her to grow up she's my baby. You know what I mean, but like to them like. They don't even care and like they my sister. My frickin is bordering. my sister even has a baby like he's only a year and a half, old and like when we were at my daughter's birthday. party we had it. At one of those like trampoline like park things."
706.0,Provider,On parks yeah.
3951.0,Patient,"yeah and. She like she was crying because, like he wanted to do with the other kids did because he's the littlest and you know so he can't do everything that you know the other kids can do and. He was crying and my sister just kept telling him to stop crying and like pushing him off of her, and I was just like what are you doing like I don't want you."
706.0,Provider,To comforting.
3951.0,Patient,"Right pick him up, and so I did like I picked him up, and you know I took him to go do something like that he could do it. was like Oh, and then she would she like actually like said to him and like. He can't talk so like he can't respond back you know, I think, but you know, like, as I was holding she's like oh you're so spoiled East in your so spoil and i'm like no baby."
706.0,Provider,"yeah no I get it, I get it and I don't know how you don't show your children affection sneaking up here's mine. He will be three on Saturday mommy huh. yeah so but I don't I don't understand how you don't show your children affection and how you don't come on them when they're hurting. Well, I suppose that's probably what they learned so. yeah what happened with you that you, you know what I mean like."
3951.0,Patient,yeah I don't know.
706.0,Provider,One out of the three decided to become this compassionate human being right was different with you.
3951.0,Patient,"yeah I don't I mean I don't know I mean maybe because, like. I don't know, maybe because, like my brother and sister are significantly younger than me like. My sisters four years younger than me my brother is five years younger than me. So, like. I was supposed to be an only child and my parents never let them forget that either like they didn't want other kids they only wanted one kid like. And we all knew it like they like the fact that they that any of us even knew that blows my mind so maybe like me being older and seeing how my parents treated. them as like babies, or you know little kids because I was older made me like you know not want to be that way with my kids. So, like I over compensate you know, maybe I mean because, like, I was saying, like I like about like On Monday I know I was saying, like about like the stuff with Christmas like. We don't have me and we don't have conventional jobs, like obviously like i've always worked in direct sales my husband, you know owns his own business, like. But we're really well off and much more well off, then my brother and sister they're all teachers all four of them so they don't make a lot of money, you know, and I almost feel like they're jealous. But it's like what in like try to make us feel better but they'll always say like you don't have a real job you're not you know. I don't know they always just made me feel less than and like like things like you know will like say like how we said, like we're going to Disney like that's one of their, how can you afford that you can afford to go to Disney like. yeah I could go today if I wanted to like why like I don't understand like why. I don't know, just like in their head I don't under I just I don't get how they think I know. I don't understand like why they would think that. I don't know like they just."
706.0,Provider,"yeah it's hard to it's hard to you know, think about kind of what's going to it could be a multitude of. The little bit, yes, yes, honey, I know you. notice how he has no hair his brother gave my haircut."
3951.0,Patient,Oh gosh.
706.0,Provider,bang up job so now he has no hair.
3951.0,Patient,"Oh, my. Poor."
706.0,Provider,"So it will grow back I keep telling myself, it will grow back. yeah so um but no, I mean it could be a multitude maybe they're jealous maybe they're like Oh well, we don't have that kind of money, so how did they have that kind of money they. Think."
3951.0,Patient,that's what it is.
706.0,Provider,"That tab so how did they have that kind of money you know wait they're not guaranteed a paycheck every two weeks because they're like not a real job you know what I mean, so what they're looking at is like we couldn't leave today and go do that, how can they you know and."
3951.0,Patient,mm hmm.
706.0,Provider,"And that's not that's not your problem, you know that's not. that's their ex. Do your parents just throw money at your kids or do they show the grandkids affection, or they affectionate with the grandkids."
3951.0,Patient,"I mean yeah yeah i'm a lot more than they were with us as kids, but they also throw money, I mean the Christmas gifts the birthday get their fucking elaborate you know they're. Like they probably spend I say for Christmas and there's I mean, I have two kids my sister has four kids my brother has a four or five six that's eight grandkids that they have and they probably spend $500 per kid for Christmas. yeah which is obnoxious like they don't need all of that stuff from one person like me as their parent okay that's fine you know if I spend that on my kids they're my kids but for you as the like buy them one gift and be done with it, they don't need 20 gifts from their grandma. Like that's silly."
706.0,Provider,"yeah so I have a mom like that mean she's super affectionate she's my best friend I can't get it drilled into her head that she does not have to give these children the world that you know they'll be fine without everything. It doesn't work, so I stopped trying, but I mean she's literally my best friend I love her in fact we're going to take a trip this next year just the two of us like an all inclusive resort she is she's awesome. You know and."
3951.0,Patient,"And he I wish that I had that kind of relationship with my mom and so, like, I think that that's why, like, I tried to. Not only parent my kids but to be friends with my kids like I want my kids to be able to talk to me about anything or. And I wanted have that relationship with my daughter when she's older."
706.0,Provider,yeah so that you have kind of what you were missing. Have you ever told your mom how you feel like that you don't feel close to. Her and that that really makes you sad. What does she.
3951.0,Patient,Say i'm too emotional.
706.0,Provider,that's you know you can't tell somebody they're too emotional you can't shame somebody for their feelings.
3951.0,Patient,And that but that's what they do.
706.0,Provider,"Because you know. It doesn't matter if they understand how you feel it's how you feel so it's real because you feel it. You know don't ever apologize for that, because if you're feeling it it's real to you for a reason they don't have to agree with it. But they have to come to a certain understanding that that's how you feel and if you're they are making you feel that way, are they okay with that and if they're not okay with that. Then, how are they going to change that you know because think about if you were doing something like let's say your daughter when she's a teenager early 20s or whatever. It says mom you make me feel this way you make me feel you know, like i'm not good enough let's say she says that to you. Whether you believe her or not, whether you think that's true or you've done things to make her feel that way or not isn't going to matter to you it's gonna be oh my gosh I am so sorry you feel that way, how can I."
3951.0,Patient,change that that would break my heart. yeah like I just said that.
706.0,Provider,"yeah so it's not even so much as you know, but you see what they're saying you don't have to, because how they're perceiving it as how they're perceiving it and it's making them feel a certain way. You know you can't make somebody feel a certain way, just like you can't unmake somebody feel a certain way it's just how they are as a person, and each individual person. In a different situation is going to feel differently mm hmm so just because your brothers and sisters don't feel the neglect i'll say of affection when they were children. does not mean it doesn't exist to you and doesn't mean that you're wrong for feeling that way and I, and I don't think you ever need to apologize for that. And I think that you know if you need to be vocal about that at times to them and be like you know i'm i'm sad like i'm sad that I don't have a better relationship with you i'm sad that. I don't feel like I can come to you with anything that makes me sad, I mean that's whether they believe you were not or tell you you're too emotional you still have the right to say it, you still have the right to say it. You know, and if they say oh you're too emotional and blah blah blah, well then, you know that's their opinion, but that doesn't mean that it's not real to you."
3951.0,Patient,"Right, you know, and I think it's just because to like even like now like. they're like super close with my brother and sister, but not with us like they babysit their kids they you know all these things, but they would never do that for my kids because, obviously, I was the first one have kids i'm the oldest and I make you know significantly older. But like when like my kids were you know littler like we're babies like if my husband and I wanted to go out for like our anniversary, or you know something like that. Like the whole thought was you shouldn't be going and doing anything without your kids your parents now, you should. You know, you were not watching them, you should be taking them with you, but now that my brother and sister have kids. They go out all the time they've taken vacations before and my parents have watched their kids for weeks. Like there was one time I had to go on a vacation when I worked in direct sales, I had to go, you know. I was at the top of the company, you know, so I had to go on a work vacation or whatever it was to Las Vegas for like a convention thing or whatever, because I had to speak at it and. My parents, and this was when my husband was in prison so like he wasn't around my parents wouldn't even watch my kids so that I could go do something for work to make more money as a single mom. Like. So I like I literally had to find a babysitter somebody who didn't know my kids to stay with them for five days."
706.0,Provider,But that was pricey.
3951.0,Patient,Right.
706.0,Provider,or not cheap.
3951.0,Patient,"Right exactly right and for five days and having you know to stay the night and I had you know, give them money to be able to go do things and to eat and to you know, whatever so yeah it was not cheap. But my parents could have easily done it for free."
706.0,Provider,"Exactly, so I guess a couple of questions come to mind, why would they give up that time with their grandkids late that quality one on one time, like Why would they want to give that up number one. But number two um, why is it okay that they help out your other siblings and not you and I think. it's okay to ask them, I mean have you asked them since then, since they started watching like your siblings. Children have you said hey can you watch our kids for a couple of hours or whatever like we're gonna we're going to go have a date night we're going to go to dinner or something have you asked them before now. Now, since they've been watching."
3951.0,Patient,"No, because I just assumed that they would say no, I think i've asked them, maybe once or twice to like watch them and it's either Oh well, yeah we already have plans or they're already watching the other kids."
706.0,Provider,They can't.
3951.0,Patient,have watched them all know they can't.
706.0,Provider,"Have all the kids together, I mean cousins but well um so. Maybe ask like I mean just to test the waters just be like So what is it December journey, for me, like February, whatever be like just pick a date we can you watch the kids because we have whatever you know just. make something out to dinner go say it's a work thing i'd mean whatever you know say something, and just see like two months from now, or thinking that Oh, we have plans. And then we're like okay it's your plans well you know it's not set in stone, we can try and make move it to this date, you know just kind of fill up that water. And then they. Generally, get all that push back then I would say simply, why is it every time Joe and Sarah need a babysitter for their kids you're just right there."
3951.0,Patient,But me.
706.0,Provider,"That I asked, which is very rare like I don't ask much at all, but you always push back you have an excuse, you have a reason why you can't."
3951.0,Patient,"Right and well now that like we're talking about you like, I remember like when my husband first you know went to jail or whatever. I was a stay at home mom you know at that time, so I did have to get a job and at first, before like I got back into like the direct sales thing, and all of that. I went back to teaching, because you know that's what my degree was in, and it was easy for me to find a teaching job, so I went back to teaching, but on a teacher salary to put two kids into daycare I would have literally been working."
706.0,Provider,To take.
3951.0,Patient,"My kids in daycare. Right and so like I was in the process, you know of applying for you know state assistance like for daycare and things like that, and my dad was home, and you know he wouldn't watch my kids. And at the time, you know I think my daughter was too, and my son was maybe four. And he would not watch my kids but now he watches my brother's kids every single day during the week every single day he gets up at 430 in the morning goes to my brother's house. gets his kids takes them back to his house or stays there, whatever you know they do that date, but what every single day, both of them."
706.0,Provider,I think that.
3951.0,Patient,And they can afford daycare.
706.0,Provider,"yeah well cuz yeah they've got two salaries. I think you need to ask why I think that, I mean I would want to know why what makes their kids so much better than your kids. Are your kids like unruly and crazy and."
3951.0,Patient,I know and that's the thing my kids. Are the most well behaved out of all of the kids.
706.0,Provider,"So, you would think that they'd want your."
3951.0,Patient,"brothers are the words they're terrible, I mean the way that they I mean I hate to speak badly about children, but they they are kids that do not get disciplined and you can tell, because you know they. don't know their. mom and then like there was a day like. My parents just moved into a new House and you know I think I told you my brother and sister would not help them move so like I had went to my mom's three days in a row. And to help her like unpack boxes and you know put things away in her house and whatever and obviously I had to take my daughter with me because she was home from school on those specific days, because she wasn't feeling well um. And so I had to take her with me well, obviously they had my brother's kids as well, because they watch them every single day. So, then, the second day when we went back my brother's kids weren't there and. My mom said something to me about something that gracie was watching on my phone and how my brother's kid was scared of what she was watching because it was too scary and my kids are. Just allowed to do whatever they want and they don't want their kids around my kids so they sent them to a babysitter that day because they didn't want them to be around my daughter."
706.0,Provider,"Oh, my gosh."
3951.0,Patient,"I mean, I was all I took my daughter, and I was, I was like that's ridiculous. So."
706.0,Provider,"So the thing is is all of this stuff that we talked about which is awesome that you're you know. sharing it, but this stuff all floats around in your head nonstop and you may not even think about it all day every day because you're so busy being a mom and shopping and being. You know, taking care of your kids and being a wife and all of that, but it's always floating around in your head and in your subconscious, and that is going to. cause your body. A stress response and your stress response is your anxiety it's it's that feeling of that edginess and that triggering feeling and that like feeling of you almost walk on like eggshells every day because you just don't feel okay. And and that's what that's what has implemented, that is because you have two other siblings that they treat differently, you have two other siblings that they treat their kids differently. You have you know you, you have you have all this going on and what is the reason, because what are your kids going to think because they're you know how."
3951.0,Patient,"older than had my son is starting. to realize like my son is starting to pick up on it he's nine years are these eight he's almost nine, but like he starting to realize that, like the other kids get to spend the night at grid papa's house, why are we allowed to."
706.0,Provider,"yeah exactly and that's the thing like did they want to sit down and explain it, I mean I think that's probably how I would approach it with with my parents, if that was the cases. You know he's old enough, he is seeing his cousin stay with you overnight, and he doesn't get to do that, do you want to explain to him why because I would like to but I don't have an explanation for it. And I think that that's fair because it is going to cause him to feel less than. And then, as your daughter, as she gets older, the same thing because, why would their cousins get to spend all that time with grandma and grandpa but they don't get to. You know it's just it's not fair and that's how kids will see it it's not fair, we know life isn't fair but there's still. needs to be accountability, and so you know your parents had no issues coming to you and being like you can't get divorced, and you need to work out your marriage and it did it did it."
3951.0,Patient,"Even though, when my husband went to. jail, they wanted me to divorce him. And yeah that makes sense."
706.0,Provider,"Exactly, they have no problem, giving their opinion to you, none, and you are very leery about giving yours to them, I think you need to just no holds barred just stop that. I think that you just need to tell them what you feel because worst case scenario they get mad at you, but it doesn't really seem like they're super involved anyway."
3951.0,Patient,"But then I think what I think is like the little bit that, like my kids do have is that if I open my mouth my kids will lose that and then they'll be nothing. And like they don't have other. Family my my husband he doesn't have like his dad died, the same year, my son was born and his mom's a drug addict like he had his brother is. A piece of shit like he he has no family he doesn't talk to any of his family. You know, so they don't have. Family on that side. And so, really is all they have."
706.0,Provider,You think that they would just get rid of your children out of their life because they're mad at you.
3951.0,Patient,"I mean honestly as disgusting as it is to even say that I wouldn't put it past them. Okay, because there were years that like they wouldn't let my husband. Come to like Christmas or things like that, and they wanted me to take my kids away from their dad. them to family have had on Christmas. Like that's what I said, I said that to that, how do you want me to explain this to my children, their dad can't come to Christmas, with them. But everybody else's dad is there, and so the one year one time and it only happened once I took them, and it was only for a few hours, but my son and, at the time, he was probably he was, I think he was only like. Five or six he was sitting on the couch and he looked like he was gonna cry and he was just sitting by himself. And I asked him what was wrong, he said, well Carter which is his cousin who's almost the same age his head he's getting to play football, you know, throwing the ball, with his dad and my dad isn't here."
706.0,Provider,"i'm just breaks your heart, especially they lost their dad for those years he was in prison granted. And he went to prison but he did his time he paid his debt to society, he rehabilitated himself obviously he's he's doing really well. And so you know he lost that time with his kids whether you know it's because he was in prison or because he was in the military or whatever, whatever he. With his kids so those kids know that they lost that time with dad and so every moment with dad after he came back is like precious to them. um oh my gosh it's so complicated your family dynamics are so complicated."
3951.0,Patient,"yeah it's awful and I don't want it to be like that, like I wish that like I had like just a normal family where everybody was closing whatever I mean even stupid things like. For the Ohio State like Michigan game, like my brother and sister and all their kids all went to my sister's House my mom and dad went over there, we weren't even invited. Like why like, why not, I mean granted we went to a friend of ours House and you know they have kids the same age as ours, and they all play together but."
706.0,Provider,Not. You know I hear you.
3951.0,Patient,"When it comes to the point where now like it like at my daughter's birthday party they same friends that I was talking about when. When they showed up in my daughter got so excited because she calls them, you know and Adrian and uncle Brett that's what she calls them. Even though they're not her aunt uncle and you should have just seen, like the dirty looks from my parents like, why are they calling them, you know yeah and uncle like. they're not there in. Like because they they have a better relationship with my kids. And then my brother and sister do that."
706.0,Provider,uncle exactly.
3951.0,Patient,"And i'm not going to stop them from calling them that because it doesn't bother me and it doesn't bother them. And they're more like family to us, then you guys are so what. I don't know."
706.0,Provider,"So we are we're at the end of our time, but I do I want you to keep working on that list that letter that whatever it is that all of the stuff that just comes flowing out of you, because I think that this is really healthy to get it all out. And so I want you to keep working on that I want you to keep working on, you know as far back as you can remember. Because, as we're talking as you can see you're like Oh, and then he did this, and they did this and oh my gosh I totally forgot about this because you've spent your whole life just pushing it under the rug. And so um we're gonna quote unquote air the dirty laundry because I think it means to get out there. You know whether you choose to say something or not I mean that is completely up to you, but I mean you know I would. really consider seeing something and then seeing what your fear is you know, like you know blah blah blah blah and I never told you this because i'm scared that you'll stop seeing your grandkids because that. Being said to grandparents, hopefully, will have an impact because grandchildren and grandparents, they have like this unique bond and, for some reason you don't see it there, but it might be there, I don't know but I mean I definitely think it's. it's worth exploring, but I think before you can tactfully do that and come up with a plan if that's something that you want to do you have to get out all of the dirty laundry air all the dirty laundry out first. get it all out of out of you so, then you can look at it and say okay. This is the stuff that really is important now, I can focus on this all that other stuff that sucked and then you process through it in therapy and then it's gone. But the stuff that's continually bothering you on a daily basis that's the stuff you need to focus on and try and figure out maybe. Some you know solution based things to do that can maybe make that better or make progress toward that or get just some kind of a reason why so that it makes more sense to you when you can rationalize it. You know, maybe they don't even realize they're doing it, you know it's hard to say it's hard to say. You know and that's and that's why those conversations need to happen, I guess, I find I don't know your parents, but I mean it just would be I don't know it would just seem very odd to me that they just intentionally try and you know outcast you and your kids it just. You know, just like I don't know it just it seems odd to me, but I mean there are people like that, but I guess that would be kind of worst case scenario and that's why I would ask those questions why. and say that your son starting to ask why can't I see a grandma and grandpa's overnight. You know. And then maybe she'll say well he's never asked oh Okay, well then, you and then you say okay well, if you want to stay with grandma and grandpa you need to ask grandma and grandpa if you can stay on a weekend. And then see kind of what that is you know because maybe your siblings are just more needy maybe they just asked all the time, can you help me with this can you do this for me and maybe you've always been more independent. And so they feel like you don't need all that help that they need, I mean I don't know there's no way to know, unless you ask. So continue on with your list of grievances, because I think you're really getting a lot of stuff out, you know, and I think it's stuff that you need to get out that you just let build up inside you. i'm um but I will see you in group next week and then I will see you in a couple weeks for therapy. All right, you take care."
3951.0,Patient,"All right, thank you."
706.0,Provider,you're welcome. bye bye.
