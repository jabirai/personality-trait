My body is kind of awesome that way my brain because. i'm not waiting for something bad to happen i'm just waiting to notice it. And I had a really cool conversation with a pharmacist here. Just about you know interaction my blood work a little lithium seems to be a lot more checks and balances. But like I said i'm so dedicated to my mental health and. When I started doing the two at night, and then the one in the morning, or one in the morning um. I mean I don't want to get too excited I almost feel like i'm becoming like a new person like my eliminate all doesn't feel like it's not working. and two and PS, I talked to Sean talon Isaiah actually Isaiah like thank God, he was there, he was like actually lithium can help really like support the Olympics all during the day.

383.0,Provider,I just thought.
5393.0,Patient,"Okay, remember, I mentioned that person from the group who then like left the group. Right Okay, so I mean that was now like. She like I said I gave up my number, I mean like I said yeah like all give out my number two like an old 300 pound lady like I like when chicks are jogging I don't like i'm just i'm not like that right, but all admit like I was a little excited she contacted me about her school whatever. And then we had that like you know texting hey how are you is very chill you know, like I said a little bit of flirting and then. She was like oh i'm leaving bright heart now because I have you and that's when I like Greek and I didn't and I didn't really like it back you're here for like a week or two. Okay, oh man, so we talked about that Okay, so now, after all, like kind of like you know genuinely concerned like she's being institutionalized and all that. So then, it just like I felt like she was like really depending on me the texting was getting out of control, one day she texted me 47 messages."
383.0,Provider,Oh wow.
5393.0,Patient,"Okay, and then she's like okay so then like we like so we'd have one phone sex Okay, and like my thing is like. No one's gonna make me feel better than random, but I do and i'm again i'm hoping my meds will help me like kind of like a drug like when those situations happen, I don't want them to it's like it's like heroin like i'm like it makes me feel good it's wrong it's not. So then i'm feeling like oh my God like like my kids are like sitting at home and i'm like in my car like texting this person like it's not okay. So, though. she's like you know sort of autonomy that like she likes me so much and. Like a lot of sexual things in in a few days, I got caught up in that, and then she was just like do you think you could fall in love with me i've been crying all night my husband and he doesn't know what's right, I mean it's just insane it was insane like she was gonna die without me. And I, and I, and I told her, then I was like I was like look I would never leave my family like this is not Okay, you know I feel really bad. She totally flipped tell me one day she was like calling me like over and over."
383.0,Provider,And I just want to ask you is this all on text or.
5393.0,Patient,"text and then, and then the page town. And she was like. And then I found myself like I like i'm not attracted to this person I will never do this to my family again like this is like i'm not going to say Karma I don't know what the Fuck it is. I was like Wednesday what the Fuck have you done this person could have ruined your life per phone sex like. it's insane and I felt really guilty with Ryan, and I didn't want to like have sex for a week is just the guiltless to me, I mean i'm never going to tell her i'm not it will ruin my life like and now but that's why i'm like I just need help with those right now. I haven't told anyone. She like told a friend, and I was like I was like like the fog and it's just it's just insane and then like I felt like I was going along with it a little bit, so I seriously thought like I didn't know was going to happen here she is she gonna kill herself if she I don't even know. So I mean honestly it's probably a good thinks it's one of those things where you're like. holy shit I will never give up like I can't even give up give up my younger like i'm just. So."
383.0,Provider,So. Where Where are you at now what what boundary have you. extended to her.
5393.0,Patient,"Mostly told her. yeah the last time it was like last week, like maybe Thursday and I said look This is like Rooney my life I. can't believe you're asking if i'm in love with you like this was supposed to be like a chill thing like text each other, whatever someone's out of town house on sites like which, again I would never do that now. And then you know that's when the 47 texts came through. And then she called me and I did answer, and then I was like Okay, I have to go right now, I have to drop this call, and like I just dropped the call and then that's why she called me like a billion times and then I finally answered, and she was like. screaming out me like. I thought you were gonna call me back like there's just like. she's walking in saying and I hate saying that because i've been saying to. But I was just like."
383.0,Provider,"Well, it sounds like what's happened is that you know she's the this the sexual engagement and the flirting has like tilted her toward you in terms of a relationship in terms of what she perceives. You to be in her life is someone that's filling a relationship role, you know. That intimacy you know. and So you know, then that Spikes people's. Obviously, a spiked her you know neediness or her desire to have you present in her life and she's reaching out to make that happen in a desperate way. Have you pulled back even further and let her know you know, like, I mean you did mention to me that you have let her know that you can't do this to your family and you're not available."
5393.0,Patient,"Oh yeah and when I told her. When she kept going like do you think you could fall in love with me and I was like. I can't I just can't even go there, like this is insane and then she sent me another long stream of checks, he actually said that she had to go to the hospital that she calls it her happy place. And that she actually went for like a psychiatric I have no idea if this is true. And I just at that point, I said Lindsay are not responsible, this is insane like you know because I don't I don't want I know what it's like to be in abysmal pain, like you, can't even fill it, so I want to save people from that, but I can't be that person anymore. I blocked her number."
383.0,Provider,"Okay, so there's like basically for the last week there's been no communication."
5393.0,Patient,"Since Thursday i've watched her number block everything I actually had to erase my APP on my phone because we just. It was it was making me feel like. I mean I betrayed my family, you know, like. It is a betrayal I mean like if, like my kiddos like knew that I was taking time away from my family and doing right, I mean. it's just yeah so I mean. it's weird it's like oh i'm never going to eat a candy bar again It made me fat, but you know i'm going to eat one like this is nothing like that. Like I just i'm glad that I didn't cause any more damage um. I can't imagine ran and doing something like that to me, I mean, I would just lose it, I would just I would just you know, like just break everything with my bare hands up horrible. And I know a lot of this is like i'm just a sick person, but that's just not a youth anymore so but yeah I just really needed to get that off my chest I just. I mean i'm just interested."
383.0,Provider,I you know don't. you're a human being and this happens and you. I mean not that i'm like condoning it but also I just think that. You know you accident you accident before it got more.
5393.0,Patient,"involved I don't know how it could have even gotten crazier. i've never experienced. That level of crazy but it's. Like. I was like oh my God I hope she doesn't like his you can see, the last name on the thing for me in group I mean I don't even know how like savvy she is from her tucking insanity I was like I really hope she doesn't know how to do anything on the fucking Internet. You know it's just terrifying. You know, like what if you took a screenshot What if you took a screenshot. And like try to like fucking real in my I mean it was just really, really."
383.0,Provider,"Right right, I know I mean these days. it's with the Internet and with what we what these phones can do that's why it's really phone sex is really not safe. You know it's not it's not a private platform at all, and so you know people can that you can even not just screenshot, but you can screen video. I realized my phone can do that I basically I can be having a video conversation and and I can be record I can record that converse that video. conversation, you can record."
5393.0,Patient,"anything good oh my God, I mean i've literally like never done anything like this um. You know, there was someone from my past that over any any and i'm like not this person anymore, this was like the worst decision I made but, like you know every once in a while like this, this one woman from the past and any cheese. i'm don't have feelings, for her, but we do have this like sexual connection, and I mean she would just randomly send me like hot pictures of her body and whatnot and like I just kept it at that. But I I shut that down like six months ago, so it's just right like he kind of like was like hey what's up I miss you and I was like you know I don't I didn't even engage because I just can't be that person I cannot look at my family and my to them, you know I cheated. Okay cheated on like every girl from that one, and then you know this this with rihanna and. But the more the more that I like how these really amazing things and I live, and I mean not making an excuse, but like. I didn't have kids I live like my little baby jetsetter life like you go wherever a wine sucking leave the country get a new job you know not have a job for a while, because the way more financially stable done and so those things like. still made me feel like really facility. And I don't want those those like it's like a drug. That these things like don't fulfill me anymore, and like my family does but it's still hard to break away plus. You know, like I don't get a lot of attention, like I don't feel like I don't even know if i'm like desirable anymore, and I think that was really What was it for me that, like, I was like well, maybe I am still desirable, you know. But yeah. Anyway, that's just yeah that was that was literally like missing the fucking like main what is it like the jugular vein like you just get cut and you're like thank God, I made it to the hospital before I did. And I just kept thinking God, I never should have checked on her, and I was genuinely worried."
383.0,Provider,"Well that's The other thing is, you know getting. These connections and friendships with other people in treatment. I know that people get some support that way, and you know that you're. You may be connecting with someone who is unstable. So."
5393.0,Patient,"i'm actually not going to reach out to anybody, and like i've talked to my sister about this a little bit, because actually this one person from deeper in the past has contacted her like hey i'm still like have feelings for you to stay and. Just be like Lindsay you know these people get kind of like strangely obsessed with you and you just can't talk to anyone you can't give out your number like you just just don't do it. You know cuz she knows it's kind of like a sickness for me. So that's where that's where i'm at right now, like if someone's dying and they like, and I like if it's not a disabled person and old person or a kid. i'm just I just can't give up. Like i'm like oh you're you're gonna have to die, and I can't help you because I will ruin my life. And not survival of the fittest for me, you know so."
383.0,Provider,"well. You know, building a friendship is a process that. I think, maybe it's it also could be you really noticing when there's that flirtation is happening. and keeping the friendship focused on. Keeping the connection focused on friendship and when you start to notice that that sexual element start to. come up. But that you're in for reinforce that you really just want to be friends. Holding that."
5393.0,Patient,"And I don't think I can do that with any of these kinda like few random people that and they probably want attention to like I mean like this, the one that you know is asking my sister has doing and stuff like that oh. God that was like. Like 15 years ago was like. And it's like you know we made each other feel like good like it was very casual like you know. yeah I mean maybe like like that person was looking for it like because they're not mental they just I just can't engage and. You know, maybe that person is kind of like a little broken to like looking for attention and they and they you know in their in their want they may want it from like anybody that's going to give it to them. You know so but yeah I just feel like I needed to get this stuff off my chest, you know I feel like. Like you see me like this and then you know i'm going to go into my regular life, and that means that, like i'm a liar i'm deceitful i'm telling you what i've done and then as soon as I step out of this, I never did that, so I just don't I don't know how to make it better."
383.0,Provider,"Right right so. You know i'm. Here, looking at this as. As as a lie. and So maybe some some other ways of framing this. People have their privacy and I know that. You know there's there's such an emphasis on like full transparency, you know let's just be fully. Transparent here and. And, and I think that that. The people are entitled to their privacy. You know you you, you had a flirtation. You put yourself back and you reassessed, and you said you know my values are my family this woman i've committed to and. This this life that I have that's what I that's what I love you know that's what I love and that's why I want, what I want to protect. I kind of have this dalliance and in my private life. And I don't want that to expand and start to take up more of my attention in fact i'm closing that down, but your private life, I mean you can you could think thoughts of. How to paint a painting, and how to design something, and it can be you don't have to share all those details with your significant other because they don't need to know and it's your thing and it's what you love to do and. it's totally harmless and in that instance, no one would say Oh, you know what are you doing like keeping your you know design plans to yourself well you're, just as we all have a private life, you know. You may read a book that that your partner doesn't read and it doesn't need to be a porn book, it could just be any book, you know, and she doesn't need to know all the things that you said it made you think about about life and."
5393.0,Patient,"feel a little better because, and I don't think she would care, but like. Okay, like, I was never really like this, but I have been watching like porn videos and like and like I touch myself like three times a year. And it's like it's like I don't know, like her, and I were going through this weird little was have and I don't think she would care about like i'm not going to tell her that, like. You know what I mean and i'm not cheating, but it also like was this weird like gap in my like sex drive it could have been from like the lithium I don't know. Like I have most extra about, but it was weird because, like, I would like, I would like need that release and then I don't know I feel like she would think that i'm weak. But that makes me feel. What you said, like a little bit better and then i'm thinking about rihanna actually. You know I remember when we first bought together she had this like tinder person that she's still kind of texted ended up being friends, but she didn't really tell me, she still had her tinder, and I mean I was like whatever like say trust her. But also like if she she's loyal to me, I know she would never leave me I know the alumni we have, I mean our bond is is is unbreakable. And I was like you know if if that makes her healthy, you know I know like there were things she probably doesn't tell me about co parenting because she knows i'm you know gonna get annoyed by it's probably better some stuff I don't know because. She doesn't you know it's all about the kids but you know there's there's stuff that finally the dad has a job he hasn't really gone for five years and so. You know I kind of let her have that, because you know, maybe it would make me feel sad Intel is the unhealthy part of me. But outside of that with her being as a person, so I always say like it's reaction it's a US and then it's it's me so it's like you ever private life, private life with us live and there has to be a thing. So that yeah that makes me feel like a lot better i'm not excusing it but. it's a learning experience and that that actually like made me feel a lot better."
383.0,Provider,"yeah yeah and it's and it's true you know it's true that we everybody is entitled to their private life, you know now we can objectively look at that and say you know is your private life, becoming unhealthy, you know. If you are hurt boy. Oh yeah if you were watching porn you know seven hours a day and that started to impact, you know I mean it could be unhealthy."
5393.0,Patient,"Okay, just saying you know i'm not a total freak it was like probably like 20 minutes or five days in a row."
383.0,Provider,"No, no i'm exaggerating i'm executive. executive luncheon about just took illustrate that they're unhealthy private life and that wouldn't could include you know and that could be damaging to your relationship."
5393.0,Patient,"So, like if I toggle all of my time and stuff like that, but like if it doesn't like. If I wake up in the middle of the night and and i'm frustrated sexually and I need to do that, like i'm not going to like tell her but it's not really like hurtful but if it was seven hours a day, I wouldn't have a job and she would hate me."
383.0,Provider,yeah.
5393.0,Patient,That makes him so good contrast for me.
383.0,Provider,"Now, I think that we want to you know it's maybe it's good to remember that you. We all have our private lives and we're we have a right to those and in and but also a responsibility that your private life does not. turn into something doing something that's good that's actually harming the other person and you pulled it back up. And not just harming the other, you know you could potentially be harming that other person as well because. But that's you know you set up a clear boundary so. And you learn something from the situation, I think that the learning is what's really very important."
5393.0,Patient,"yeah and that was a reminder for me, though. If I give in to those moments, and like I said it's like like I remember the last time, like I did so um. Because let's be because it was still like when I first met Ryan, and I was still like cipher that was like my dog town. Where. I was I wasn't living with her, so I was definitely like dishonest and like there a couple times we were supposed to have plans and I was like. Sorry, I don't know i'm gonna read right now like, and then this one time she was like Where are you i'm picking you up, you have to go on the date with me and like you know stuff like stuff like that I look back i'm like oh my God, how did she put up with me. And so I look at that, like looking back at that I wish I would have had that extra half an hour with me in and instead of like doing something that's going to make me feel so shitty the next day and it's hard because, like my brain like. I don't know I think it's just me, maybe feeling hopeful about the lithium maybe having a little bit in my system and then me taking this situation and then I got laid off last last Friday, so I did all of my like resort stuff. So that's all I got all of that going before I left out of town has to I want to make sure ringing in his like so so all my phones and everything going gone so."
383.0,Provider,So tell me this again the trip that you're taking are you. you're going I know you're going to Europe you're going to Turkey in Amsterdam.
5393.0,Patient,Okay ready i'm finally excited i'll be so excited we'll talk about it. it's only got excited i'm leaving tomorrow.
383.0,Provider,Going with.
5393.0,Patient,"My friend Tom like he's a really safe person. You know I really wanted to bring my family, but like they're in school and it's just too much and Amsterdam would be a little overwhelming for them. And it's really cool me and Ryan, and like like sure she went on a trip with like her friends like to New Orleans and like stuff like that, like well like we like really encourage each other to be with friends and do do that, like our nice private life. You know, can go with her friends, she can talk all this shit she wants about me if she's annoyed or she can say how amazing it, you know it's like. I because I get it like i'm a person and so. it's kind of strange, leaving them there will be away for 10 days but yeah me and my good friend Tom we've been friends for 20 years. He actually gated and was was in a long term relationship with my twins to a few years ago, so that's you know that's interesting. We we just been through so much like we're just so bonded like I have like three friends like him my friend katie. And then another friend from years ago um. So anyway we're gonna we're gonna leave tomorrow from SL. will take a 13 hour flight to Turkey chill there for a bit and then we'll take. A three hour 45 minute flight to Amsterdam so it's like we're going forward in time and then bathroom Tyrone. will be there for 10 days already because, like. I know how like I have this thing like when i'm trapped when I travel I like to you know do some like. underground naughty stuff like maybe go to a strip club whatever but see like i'm not that person anymore, and like honestly I have like i'm not even going to. Like a look at the red light district i'm not even going to like step foot over there just out of respect for in and out of everything that I did, knowing the kind of person I am like. If someone my catches my eye and it's like this, like naughty place and I get this like weird feeling in my head, I know that I can say no, but I just don't even want to be around that like i'm not going there for anything like that. I want to be able to like. prove it to myself, I could be like totally on my own no one's babysitting me have another chance to prove that I could like say no to temptation. And so I really I want to keep that, not because I feel like I have to like sacrifice something for her and she she doesn't care like. um you know what I do obviously need to be faithful honest but um I just want to make sure like I don't I can be totally wholesome and have all of that fulfillment and then we're just going to be there we're staying at this cute little flat. And we're not like renting a car we're just going to get their trigger on my friends from my friend is Dutch his last name is matt sheldon and so like there's the band houghton like chocolate factory there. And then he's got some like little I don't know family stuff so we're gonna go check out. might be fun to take a train to like Paris I think it's only like a few hours. So we'll see we'll see how much money we have we'll see what happens."
383.0,Provider,Have you been to Turkey before.
5393.0,Patient,"No, I do have a friend that just felt bad have you been there."

5393.0,Patient,"I want to see the login Sofia like I am that I studied so much about are in college like I love. Ancient art just thinking these things that are like God, what did I just read, I think there was this piece of art or this little relic just found in in Turkey, and I want to share it was like. 7000 years old, or something crazy and to think like this, like this is my passion like to pull something from the ground that is your bad that long fairly primitive tools even. is just. breathtaking so I don't know I hope we can go see some tone on. tone a historical sites, I think that's one of my favorite things about traveling is like. Like when I was in London to see like this, you know the white tower called the jewels think it had survived when was it like. I don't know like 10 hundred or something like it survived like. I don't know like World War Two and all kinds of stuff but it's just it's so old like it's just so fun to look I just like looking at like things from thousands of years ago."
383.0,Provider,yeah yeah so stay focused on that you know when you get to answer down what you know what historical. are available for you to go to museums.
5393.0,Patient,"going to do a lot of museums yeah Van Gogh hopefully see some Vermeer, I mean God there's only like several in the world, or something to look out so. yeah."
383.0,Provider,"Just just stay focused on those things and and filling your time and and days with. With those pursuits. And 10 days is not a long time, so if you're filling your time with all the with the you know artistic related pursuits that will take up your time."
5393.0,Patient,"yeah super excited. about that. i'm just writing by just yeah here does people are like super Nice and already communicating with like our host like she just says we'll just. I don't know, like, for some reason, and I look i'm like crazy like American i'm pale read here. I don't know people sometimes think i'm from the east coast or like you haven't asked and i'm like no i'm but like I don't know foreign people I just really get along with like so i'm just really excited."
383.0,Provider,And I can't be so friendly.
5393.0,Patient,"I know yeah that's that's what i'm doing there. You know I thought I was going to be working for like I thought today was gonna be my last day and then I was just going to go tomorrow but i'm like thanks fucking God I got laid off, last Friday, because I don't I would have been so stressed getting ready."
383.0,Provider,yeah now.
5393.0,Patient,"I want to tell you one more funny thing about this makes me feel really stuff so brianna and cannot make coffee, I was out of town one time I got home and there was like a coffee filter with old coffee and then another coffee filter with coffee, I was. Like whoa. What have you done so, I have to get like coffee filter around coffee and then another one, and then it shows like for 10 days so she just has to open the thing the thing and then and i've marked the water. lunches because the kids hate like when brianna mix lunches and just like oh my God, what are you doing like it's just so crazy, so I think all the lungs been kind of ready to go, like all the dry dry stuff. This is just like it's like she's she's gonna be so wrecked without me. Just kind of laughing."

5393.0,Patient,dead so.
383.0,Provider,"Care of a lot of practical. you're a practical person you you kind of are organized sounds like you, you like to, and you can do that easily."
5393.0,Patient,"yeah i'm definitely way more I mean don't take this in a harsh way, but just more militant and you know that's kind of how I was brought up like. You know I make my bed every morning I like to you know clean the kitchen, so I can like wake up things being Nice and i'm not mental about it. But it just makes me think that too, like when I was in rehab. One of the times. We got up at six and we had to make our beds and we had to do, like all the all the stuff like cleaning and food. we'd huddle around the coffee maker, we only had decaf and trying to like you know, maybe steer we'll see if we can get any caffeine out today. that's like total drug addicts doing that um but that's just really oh it's something I created was like baseline like it kind of like saved my life, a little bit. And so um you know, like ran into can't she can't she can't she can't handle folding laundry like I pulled all the laundry will mean the kids do it. But then she like she has her things that she does for me that are amazing and.

383.0,Provider,"You next time. bye bye. Okay, so suicide risk assessment, I would say she's low risk. At this time she's reporting. of being a really positive. outlook on life she's planning this trip. And so she's got lots of support from family and is invested in her life. So those are all protective factors, I would say the risk factor for her is you know ongoing thoughts of wanting you know suicidal ideation. Which. is still present, she says, from time to time so we'll keep an eye on that I will maintain her flag and pulse and. we'll just keep keep an eye on her, but I will i'd like to. assess her at low risk. let's just say low to moderate risk. Due to those risk factors of intermittent and ongoing suicidal ideation despite all her protective factors, thank you."
