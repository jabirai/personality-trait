14070.0,Patient,Now.
408.0,Provider,You see me.
14070.0,Patient,"Yes, very good signal right now I got disconnected terrorist I got a video oh."
408.0,Provider,"I see I see okay well i'll need you to verify your name and date of birth. Okay, thank you, so I was informed by bright heart health that we have not yet completed your bio psychosocial assessment apparently at our first session we didn't. get enough information about your history your family history your medical history your substance use history so we're going to need to do that now. I thought we had collected, some of those data but they're saying no, we need to collect a little more. So let's get that done so tell me, even though we may be repeating some of the information you already discussed with me or with your prescriber, for that matter, so let's cover the first age or point at which you began using substances."
14070.0,Patient,The first. 1514.
408.0,Provider,"Okay, and what is the longest period of remission you have some substance use."
14070.0,Patient,Two years.
408.0,Provider,"Two years and correct me if i'm wrong. But my information is at believe you told me at the last session that your last relapse occurred, about a year ago, correct. Yes, okay good. So you're working back on working your way back to that two years sobriety point that you achieved earlier and we've been working in our individual sessions on a relapse prevention plan to achieve your goal of maintaining your sobriety. The other questions about medical history have to do with the age at which you were diagnosed with any additional. Health or mental including mental health diagnosis, such as ADHD mood disorder oppositional defiant disorder conduct disorder anything like that."
14070.0,Patient,Possibly a ADHD but I never been. My parents never one wanted to take me to give me treated.
408.0,Provider,"All right, what do you recollect about the agent, which you were diagnosed with ADHD."
14070.0,Patient,allows those.
408.0,Provider,10 and you were diagnosed by your primary care physician pediatrician school psychologist.
14070.0,Patient,Both school and. Family health care.
408.0,Provider,"Okay, all right mm hmm."
14070.0,Patient,i've actually been pediatrician I can't so.
408.0,Provider,"And you have never been treated for that condition, either in childhood to adulthood."
14070.0,Patient,No.
408.0,Provider,Okay i'm.
14070.0,Patient,kind of self freedom.
408.0,Provider,"well. At least the research tells us that the only effective treatment is medication, because that is a neurological disorder pertaining to some underactive neural circuits and the prefrontal cortex so counseling, in other words. You know, herbal remedies caffeine may have some temporary effect any psychostimulants like caffeine or nicotine may have some temporary treatment effect on the ADHD because they stimulate that circuit in the brain but typically for not very long. fun facts effects, you know with caffeine and nicotine as well."
14070.0,Patient,That means.
408.0,Provider,"Well, of course, this if you check them out non prescribed amphetamines those generally are not targeted and controlled in the same way that prescription. ADHD medications are to target the specific area of the brain without other side effects but you're saying I think you may have noticed some effects from street drugs street versions of meth."
14070.0,Patient,yeah.
408.0,Provider,yeah tell me a little bit more about that.
14070.0,Patient,Please started using us in the. Mass to basically help me. be able to sit down and actually build a strict directly straight think on something that I need to be concentrated on.
408.0,Provider,And what do you know about the. Effects of long term mess use i'm talking about the street drug mouth.
14070.0,Patient,"Honey i'm sorry he said, one more time."
408.0,Provider,"Yes, what do you already know about the long term effects of the of math that methamphetamine, in other words, as it is produced on the street."
14070.0,Patient,yeah it'll make you very lonely.
408.0,Provider,Okay.
14070.0,Patient,Will strip you of your. From your family. will leave you nothing.
408.0,Provider,"All right, what about the physiological effects."
14070.0,Patient,"Like your hair. The tears to brain. Ryan, and much more. In your body."
408.0,Provider,Right so did you ever experienced those some of those effects like teeth teeth deterioration hair falling out trimmers in the extremities anything like that not eating.
14070.0,Patient,No night yeah.
408.0,Provider,But you're aware that those are. associated with long term use.
14070.0,Patient,"Yes, yes."
408.0,Provider,"Okay, so the prescriptions prescription medicines, such as Ritalin or adderall concert. For dexedrine. Which are frontline treatments for ADHD. Do not have those long term. Physical effects or social effects. They can reduce your appetite of course they can do that, but not to the extreme extent that street math does. And of course they're targeted and carefully tie traded That means the dosage is adjusted specifically to the symptoms and level of the ADHD condition as it's. manifesting in attentional focus attentional shifting hyperactivity and impulsivity."
14070.0,Patient,and
408.0,Provider,"to some degree, anger and oppositional symptoms."
14070.0,Patient,Like I really think that I could probably. quit doing math if if if I had an actual I guess you would say prescription medication to control. That aspect of my brain instead of me having. To methamphetamine to self treat you know.
408.0,Provider,"But you are aware that street myth is habituated. Unlike prescribed ADHD meds, in other words you become addicted to it."
14070.0,Patient,Right right right right yeah that's why that's why i'm still user but but but it all started when yes and I had had mentioned saying I bet you use math for six to get off the heroin and the.
408.0,Provider,pain you feel I hear you. that's pretty common.
14070.0,Patient,"And then, then whatever done that, then, then I realized this will help me you're saying costs and trading bill sit down and think straight and not get."
408.0,Provider,"I understand yeah and that's like I say that's a pretty common experience when people have ADHD and they aren't treated for it. They have much higher odds of developing a substance use disorder of any kind in adolescence to adulthood than the general population does now, specifically the street math. I got I think you know this, but i'm just going to say it, just to be sure Okay, Mr Kevin you do understand that if you were able to be treated for your ADHD with the appropriate medication in and of itself, that would not sure your addiction to street methamphetamines. you'd still have to go through withdrawal and treatment for that addiction. You see what i'm saying. Can you hear me. I see that you have muted your microphone."
14070.0,Patient,"yeah we got disconnected or something else. Well let's say completely disconnected but. Show for a minute, then my screen sit connecting and then I said recording in progress again."
408.0,Provider,"Right right okay so um I don't know how much of that last bit that I was sharing with you, you actually heard."
14070.0,Patient,I didn't get here very much.
408.0,Provider,"Okay, so uh. What I had said, is that I believe you already understand the information I was about to state, but I needed to state it anyway, just to confirm that you understand that. Once you were effectively treated for your ADHD with the appropriate prescription medication, that would not cancel the addiction to the street methamphetamines the habituation that your brain has reshaped itself to."
14070.0,Patient,You.
408.0,Provider,"still need to undergo withdrawal and treatment for the primary. substance use disorder to meth. To the street right. Yes, okay okay that's very important because that's not, of course, an easy substance use disorder to treat or to recover from it can be done. But it's not going to automatically take place once your ADHD is treated, but I I understand what you're saying about what you noticed about the way your brain functions, when you are taking street math and that does make sense."
14070.0,Patient,"Well, the reason I said it was because. i've been trying to slowly wean myself off of it anyways threes and I was saying that."
408.0,Provider,"Good good, are you currently. In an intoxication or or withdrawal stage from that while we're speaking."
14070.0,Patient,"No, no i'm. Actually, currently using i'm just kind of slowly slowly stop little by little, day by day."
408.0,Provider,"Okay, is your is your right heart health and medical prescriber aware of this. Yes, all right, because that detoxification needs to be monitored. Yes, Okay, and you understand that if you have adverse severe adverse withdrawal effects, you need to go to an emergency room. Yes, Okay, although you know great heart health does medication assisted treatment so that's what your prescriber can work with you on."
14070.0,Patient,Right.
408.0,Provider,"Okay, good, and so you have discussed this, the ADHD and tapering the street mess with your prescriber. Just."
14070.0,Patient,"A little bit not not a whole lot. But he does know that i'm slope Panda yes, a taper off the use of methamphetamine."
408.0,Provider,"All right now, Mr Chris does has had a family emergency and I just found out he's been out this week, and he will be away next week um I just found that out. tonight."
14070.0,Patient,I haven't actually seen Mr Cruz.
408.0,Provider,Or you have not would describe or have you seen that you've informed about this.
14070.0,Patient,"Mr Cruz, but what I was what I was trying to say was i've only seen Mr Cruz once and that was whatever like my very first intake of. coffee. Whenever whenever I first came to my house i've seen, then the following couple weeks, he was out somewhere for something."
408.0,Provider,He was doing a clinical rotation as part of his credentialing.
14070.0,Patient,yeah.
408.0,Provider,"And I haven't seen anything I say. All right, well, Dr shard of own is covering for him. While he's away for the family emergency, so you can request an individual session with john shirt avoid by going back to the virtual clinic. and asking for that you can also connect with the description clinic which I mixed, I mentioned that in group. When he was away on the clinical rotations so you have either of those options available to you that you know, to see how, if you could get up a sooner appointment with the medical providers for prescribing."
14070.0,Patient,"deployments Mr Cruz, I think, on the 30th but I actually end up missing my appointment that day."
408.0,Provider,"I say okay well i'm just offering you that option it since it sounds like you're really ready to and have them ready to start working on this piece of your health and you're functioning and so. Rather than just wait. Longer you do have that. option. of going to the virtual clinic and requesting an appointment with Dr sharjah boy. who's the cover the cover doctor for Mr proves. Even any questions about that. Oh, we lost you again, we got lost our connection. Are we back."
14070.0,Patient,Can you hear me.
408.0,Provider,"Yes, Sir, so I was saying, do you have any questions about getting in touch with an alternate medical provider for to prescribe and discuss medication assisted treatment with you during Mr cruises absence."
14070.0,Patient,"No was the you what there was told to last time that you, you got me set up and help to give me set up with a new provider."
408.0,Provider,"A new prescriber. That would have been the virtual clinic or the prescription clinic. I do, but I a behavioral health. clinician i'm i'm also a doctor, but i'm a behavioral health doctor, so I do behavioral health treatment. Okay, not prescribe."
14070.0,Patient,Right I just thought you I thought you'd got me set up with a different provider last time I talked to you I can't remember what the reason was but.
408.0,Provider,"I don't I mean I think Mr Cruz had left instructions. With the group. Last time, he was there that during his absence group members who had prescription needs could go to the virtual clinic and they can navigators would connect you with the prescription clinic."
14070.0,Patient,No yeah. There was something else. Somebody else it's OK.
408.0,Provider,So i'm. In your current status with what you are thinking about and doing behaviourally to prevent relapse let's review some of the strategies that you are currently using I know exercises one of them. Tell me a little bit about what you've been doing in the last two weeks.
14070.0,Patient,As far as much as.
408.0,Provider,As far as anything you're doing on your relapse prevention plan so things that you know to do to prolong your sobriety and prevent relapse I know a couple of the things we're staying away from people known drug users and.
14070.0,Patient,"just been going to work and carolyn home. Take him a medicine, you know it's. Basically, all the time I have any hill. I think right now actually have code right now."
408.0,Provider,Oh i'm so sorry.
14070.0,Patient,"yeah i'm actually off work let's see I think today's the second day that i've missed work but. I wasn't confirmed until last night, whenever I got my email saying that I was paused so I guess i'm starting my 14 day. quarantine yeah."
408.0,Provider,Are you also quarantining from other household members.
14070.0,Patient,Yes.
408.0,Provider,So you have a separate bathroom you have a separate bedroom you're having. left without direct contact.
14070.0,Patient,I don't think it really matters because I think we all have everyone my wife has that that's how I got it anyhow because she's a health care worker.
408.0,Provider,oh dear. anyone else in the household.
14070.0,Patient,yeah both my kids.
408.0,Provider,Now. As anyone. else.
14070.0,Patient,Under treatment one big. nose just since we're just one big happy family.
408.0,Provider,"Well, I mean the problem is that whoever recovers first. It could, it could be a chain of events over time. Where you recover, you have temporary immunity, but then you give it to each other again so that's the difficulty there. you're right, who is the WHO is the least ill person in the household that is like cooking and cleaning. Nobody."
14070.0,Patient,me.
408.0,Provider,Oh boy.
14070.0,Patient,yeah.
408.0,Provider,"Well, I am so sorry, and I certainly send you my best wishes for good health for you and the children. You do have transportation available or, of course, ambulance if you need to go to the hospital right."
14070.0,Patient,Oh yeah.
408.0,Provider,Do you have a pulse oximeter to monitor your oxygen oxygen level.
14070.0,Patient,mo watched us.
408.0,Provider,"that's a good thing. All right, well, I appreciate your showing up for the appointment, given that you're so sick i'm so sorry to hear that."
14070.0,Patient,"We are not as long as i've taken i've been taking their food and, believe it or not actually I feel fine today like sick at all. Okay, but. The past three days, I had the had the worst headache ever. Past eight. But as yesterday I took medicine yesterday and today, and I feel completely found."
408.0,Provider,Well that's a lucky thing for the whole household that at least one of you is well enough to function.
14070.0,Patient,Do.
408.0,Provider,"So um. Before you can track did cove it and, of course, you we just recently confirmed that you were testing positive for that. yeah what what other relapse prevention strategies were using and I know that you work long hours and that that's a difficulty, but we had discussed some other things like certainly staying away from drug users staying away from places that reminded you of drug use."
14070.0,Patient,"i'm going to pick on my free time watch how to go in the woods and. check, my dear cameras and stuff which I really."
408.0,Provider,"Right, you were looking forward to deer hunting and we talked about the issue of that was that was an activity that you associate with drug use so that's a challenge but. you're going out in nature and preparing to go deer hunting, have you been doing any. breathing exercises i'm talking about before coven to relax have you been doing any mental strategies to help yourself to. focus on well being not associated with drug abuse."
14070.0,Patient,No really have the time just going to work and coming home eight one bed.
408.0,Provider,"So no physical exercises, you know lifting weights doing burpee stretching anything like that."
14070.0,Patient,"No just pando daily normal function at work, which I guess was there."
408.0,Provider,Are you having any pain at this time anywhere. No okay that's good no aches and pains covert or from straining any muscles at work.
14070.0,Patient,No did have some body aches Sir past few days okay when but.
408.0,Provider,"i'm sure. that's probably what the therapy was helping with a little bit. yeah okay. All right, well um we do need to continue to work on your relapse prevention plan and some of the behavioral strategies that have been found to be useful in managing. substance use disorders, as a chronic condition, because the evidence we have is that the neural circuits that are changed by the substances tend to be. have some lasting effects the changes so even though you're in recovery and you're not using it's important to develop. Some life skills that are specific to maintaining sobriety and many of those are behavioral life skills that increase your sources of reward. pleasure gold seeking that are not associated with seek with drug seeking okay and physical exercises actually probably won't surprise you, has been one of the very available. activities that can be used to increase well being and increase up a goal setting with an accomplishment right that you can feel you've accomplished something, because you have right with a physical exercise routine."
14070.0,Patient,Oh yeah.
408.0,Provider,"So you know what i'm talking about so that's something I really would like to work with you on one sure you and your family are recovering a little bit more. And you and you get to deal with some of these pressing issues around your math use and you're at untreated ADHD which are certainly priorities, plus keeping on with your work and helping your family and yourself to get well again."
14070.0,Patient,Right.
408.0,Provider,yeah now in terms of our psychosocial assessment over the last two weeks have you had any thoughts of wishing you were dead or any self directed violence urges.
