8790.0,Patient,"I don't know I don't know if the thoughts are. drowned out by the medication why can't. earn. Put it all together and why I feel like that. I don't know I mean something's there, but I just don't know what I think because. I. Like I feeling happy in life but there's, but I have a great boyfriend I have my own apartment I was a great job, I have a part, you know have my family like it's, not that I don't know what it is a dog. I just."
416.0,Provider,hold on a second i'm gonna look into your chart so I won't be able to see you for just a minute. hold on. Technology or hold on. Have you been taking all your medication that.
8790.0,Patient,yeah.
416.0,Provider,And then tell me when you're when you're hot when you say you have highs and. Are they were.
8790.0,Patient,The happiest.
416.0,Provider,"So, when you say hi you just mean happier you don't mean like like you're buying things you can't afford or your behaviors out of control, or you have energy and you're staying up all night or anything like that. Okay. So it's mostly just your it sounds like you're experiencing kind of an increase in some of your major depression."
8790.0,Patient,or.
416.0,Provider,you're having like episodes of major depression that are increased okay. and And you spit you said no suicidal thoughts right.
8790.0,Patient,"No, I just think like. Like if you would just help them, or like I find myself when I train me. On like."
416.0,Provider,That sounds pretty low Jamie.
8790.0,Patient,"yeah when I was driving on the freeway the other day just popped in my head and it's like there was this big truck in front of me, and like. I just thought of something flying off the truck. coming through the windshield at me. I don't lie I. have this fall I do."
416.0,Provider,Okay. So um. When was the last time that you had a one on one with chantel.
8790.0,Patient,A couple months ago.
416.0,Provider,"Okay, can we get you back in right away. Because you know if I don't know if that's what's happening, but you're definitely having an increase in your depression. And what you're describing is like your life has going pretty well, you can see, like intellectually, you can see, all of the. Positive steps that you're taking you're proud of yourself you're feeling good all of that's good, but then you're still experiencing an increase in symptoms that sounds chemical to me."
8790.0,Patient,yeah it's like. i've lived my life so long. yeah think. That it's hard for me. To grasp this life.
416.0,Provider,Okay.
8790.0,Patient,"You know, like I don't want to you, I mean I do, but I don't. But it's like. it's overwhelming."
416.0,Provider,But you don't always know how to be quote unquote normal.
8790.0,Patient,Right.
416.0,Provider,And it's kind of is it kind of boring also.
8790.0,Patient,I mean I miss.
416.0,Provider,"You. What do you miss about it what's the, what are the things you miss."
8790.0,Patient,feeling and. Not in reality.
416.0,Provider,So you miss you miss being able to check out. yeah and you missed the you missed the actual like dopamine rush hi.
8790.0,Patient,yeah.
416.0,Provider,"Okay, and it's pretty common have you talked about this at. An angle."
8790.0,Patient,I don't really share. My sponsor. I talked to my sponsor.
416.0,Provider,Have you talked to her about this.
8790.0,Patient,mean. Little things like you know I missed it and I get triggered a lot. You know.
416.0,Provider,"So there's this um I mean definitely I think you should. This is a, this is a place, this is an ideal opportunity for you to connect with the recovery community. So I know that you don't talk a lot of groups, this is a good."
8790.0,Patient,"Like I don't like I don't want to like talk to people afterwards, like. I I can address it, but then after the meeting you know people will come up to me and try, you know just I don't want to talk about it with them. So that's why I don't share, because I know people will have the same feeling that I just. don't feel comfortable. Oh i'm there for your own you know the comfort of them I just. know. That."
416.0,Provider,"So there's there's a couple ways to handle that. One is. To not talking meetings right and to just go straight to your sponsor with this. The other thing is. When you're sharing to say. here's what I need and here's what I don't need. I would love feedback in the group I would love to hear how you all handle this and, but please don't come up to me afterwards I feel really uncomfortable with that."
8790.0,Patient,"I don't know people that are judgmental and I don't know nothing so things like oh what's your problem, or I don't know I just. I don't think i'm."
416.0,Provider,hearing a lot about what people think these days.
8790.0,Patient,"Go I just. don't want to they're not gonna I don't really worry about what they think I just know how they're going to be and, like I don't want to put myself out there, like that."
416.0,Provider,"Okay Okay, but can you do it with your sponsor which you feel comfortable with that."
8790.0,Patient,"I just feel comfortable telling you. I mean, I told my sponsor. I know we've talked about it. I haven't told anybody about how I feel like."
416.0,Provider,yeah no i'm not talking about that i'm thinking more of just like the. I miss using because I missed the high I miss using because I missed the the being able to just check out sometimes.
8790.0,Patient,yeah i've talked to my sponsor about that for sure.
416.0,Provider,And what does she say about that.
8790.0,Patient,"You know she just reminds me where I used to be in. You know. And you know just basically. whoa and then what you know if you going to come down and going to feel like shit you're going to you know lead your son, and you know she talked me out of it. hmm and I talked to my boyfriend about it, too, and he's really good in the program and he reminds me why. But I still feel you know I still have that feeling yeah and that obsession has not been lifted by my boyfriend. That he doesn't have any savings thing for at all like maybe that will happen one. so far."
416.0,Provider,"Well, I think, part of it is that. The physical cravings might be gone, but for you it's not just about the physical craving and it's about it's about the actual high right it's about getting that sort of rush and and all of this stuff. That your sponsor and your boyfriend have told you are so important, I couldn't agree more with all of that I, you know there's so many reasons that the downsides outweigh the upsides to that high. And I think that what you're really craving or you're craving Aha you're craving a dopamine rush you you're craving some fun some excitement right."
8790.0,Patient,"i'm crazy to check out like you said, like."
416.0,Provider,mm hmm.
8790.0,Patient,No go.
416.0,Provider,"mm hmm. So then it's about finding a way that it won't be exactly the same in every well but trying to find a. A way to. To get some of that without. Without the downsides. Right. You know, some people do it with exercise, which I know there's something you've been struggling with. Some people, some people do it with adrenaline. Two people do it with sex, which is another thing that you've been struggling with I know. So a lot of your sort of outlets your checkout outlets your your dopamine rush. they're. There they're not there, so of course you're craving."
8790.0,Patient,well.
416.0,Provider,was the last time you remember feeling like. Like light and exhilarated.
8790.0,Patient,or.
416.0,Provider,When you weren't high.
8790.0,Patient,"Well, I had a dog. And I was taking care of me years ago was this. Maybe like. Five years ago, maybe four and. I was taking care of a family friend with Ms and it's in a beautiful area oh hi and. For a moment I wasn't drinking or doing drugs, I was just taking care of them and I adopted a dog, and I was the happiest i've ever been but I was working 24 hours, taking care of them and I didn't have felt that I, I really good. Getting high worried it. But I remember feeling very good when I was when I was in place and and I had my dog."
416.0,Provider,"Okay So what do you think, out of all of that what you think was the part that kind of made you feel really like. Like exhilarated or high."
8790.0,Patient,the beauty of the area place to house. Is the. Flowers and plants all around this little house.
416.0,Provider,And do you have that now.
8790.0,Patient,yeah. yeah.
416.0,Provider,What else makes you feel exhilarated or what have you always wanted to try. I mean honestly. Honestly i'm thinking like does she like roller coasters.
8790.0,Patient,I want to exercise. Getting Jim past and. What I want to do is take. Like a class.
416.0,Provider,"Just gonna say that. I look. cool in zoom but but it's so fun, I mean I literally cannot. I cannot hold the beat to save my life like wait."
8790.0,Patient,Because i'm going to go shopping for groceries maybe i'll go by i'll do that first thing we my boyfriend going to go shopping for groceries and Halloween decorations and maybe i'll just go straight to choose fitness and they have glasses.
416.0,Provider,"What if you instead of getting the membership when, if you did most of them will let you take a class as a trial. You could do that you could take a trial class and see."
8790.0,Patient,yeah. yeah.
416.0,Provider,"I think I think this is your mission, though Jamie is like. We gotta find you something that you feel excited about and passionate about and like you know that, like you really get into whether it's like. A new social connection or zoom or it could be a combination of things. Like. zoom was so fun and there's like a whole community that's around it, and nobody cares if you have a you're good at the beat or not right. And yoga is another Community that's like that. So you know it's about like you know we're finding find your thing. You know you got to find something that you feel like that rush that you get excited."
8790.0,Patient,Today I have.
416.0,Provider,And if it's not that then it's not that then you're going to keep looking right.
8790.0,Patient,"I wonder, I just have been taking. For so long and i'm at the high those for so long that it."
416.0,Provider,you're not at the highest dose zoloft. you're at 100 milligrams right.
8790.0,Patient,No 200.
416.0,Provider,Oh you're at 200 oh yeah.
8790.0,Patient,I am at the highest. dosage of the booth for. don't maybe.
416.0,Provider,"So check in I mean that's another reason to check in with chantel so two goals, this week, and I want to i'm hoping, I can see you sooner rather than later, since you've been feeling down right let's not wait so long. But two goals, one is work on finding your thing right if it's if it's zoom but if it's whatever recognize that it might not be an instant love so give it a little time. Right, especially if you're not like that in shape and then you're doing it for the first time, you might not be like Oh, whatever it right. But give it a little time and see if you like, it and look for that thing that thing that you feel good and excited about. And then the second thing is check in with chantel I think that we've got some chemical stuff going on, we can boost your natural highs through exercise and through excitement and that sort of thing but there also might be something else chemical going on for you. How does that sound for a goal."
8790.0,Patient,yeah oh.
416.0,Provider,Can we see each other. soon.
8790.0,Patient,"Let me get my calendar. Okay, so."
