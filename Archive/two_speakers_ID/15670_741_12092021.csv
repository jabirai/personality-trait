741.0,Provider,"Okay Okay, and because I don't know you are, you are you like, are you i'm in a mental health program or a substance abuse Program."
15670.0,Patient,"I think mental health, I think. I think so because I think it's mostly they're concerned about if i've had alcohol or not. Like that's like the main, at least for the group therapy and then like the. The regular therapist is kind of I think helping me with my relationship. But i'm not sure which program exactly."
741.0,Provider,Probably mental health. And do you have a history of abusing alcohol.
15670.0,Patient,I yeah I think so yeah.
741.0,Provider,Okay.
15670.0,Patient,"which I have learned so long, but today i'm like damn wanting to go back it's been like few months, and now I feel like I want to go back to drinking again."
741.0,Provider,Right right well i'll tell you that you already know it's not a solution.
15670.0,Patient,yeah no.
741.0,Provider,No just make it worse.
15670.0,Patient,Oh God.
741.0,Provider,"You know it kind of casual drink and you'll forget, and then you know remember when you wake up."
15670.0,Patient,And whoa yeah that's on. Your worst the next day.
741.0,Provider,Right and then we may even have a mess to clean up because. I heard you know that I know what i'm talking about.
15670.0,Patient,Yes.
741.0,Provider,"Yes, so what he said that you're in a situation that you don't know what to do about. Okay."
15670.0,Patient,"Why should I be kicked out my relationship, when I feel like it's, to the point where like i'm trying to leave, and I feel like I can't even I feel stuck just like stuck like I don't I think I don't have a place to go far away they're not in the same city. Okay, and. My friends, I mean they kind of stopped talking to me, since i've been in this relationship so or they don't think then aware of what's going on. So I don't know what to do, I don't know how to get out and I don't know how to like get on wi fi and like leave and like like start like I don't know how to get out because the more in it, the more I stand at the more i'm like like in this place in this mindset. Okay. And then i'm being convinced that it's not the relationship and it's just me. But like."
741.0,Provider,Every relationship takes to.
15670.0,Patient,yeah I know.
741.0,Provider,"So if there's an issue you have a part in and they have a part in it, whoever that other person is has as much responsibility for the relationship as you do."
15670.0,Patient,"And I just like is a pile of bricks on my like I feel like i'm doing this huge burden on me and I can't like I can't release it because it doesn't want to leave it just wants to stay and not listen to like respect my boundaries, so what I want what I like like."
741.0,Provider,Can that's.
15670.0,Patient,"strong enough. To like. I don't know how much stronger I can be like I don't know what I need to do, inside and like I don't know like if I need to like like I don't know how much stronger I can be without reacting. And like being crazy."
741.0,Provider,"Right okay. and One of the. Things that I can suggest for you. Is. That will help you make will help make you stronger and within yourself. Is I want you to make a list of things that you're grateful for the things that you do have. Okay, I know it sounds horrible at this. point in your situation. But if you can do that, you can figure out what your strengths are. If you can focus. On the positive, it will shut down the negative. Okay."
15670.0,Patient,write it down I guess.
741.0,Provider,"Last year. So make a list of the things that you're grateful for. The things that are positive in your life. The other thing is that, if your friends have stopped talking to you because of the relationship, then you might want to talk pick one friend to talk to you about. Their ideas on how you can leave the relationship, because they obviously don't support the relationship does that make sense. So I would talk to one of them."
15670.0,Patient,"A good reason to not support it, they have valid reasons I just I don't know how to like."
741.0,Provider,How do we admit that you were wrong and that they were. Probably on point and you should have listened to their.
15670.0,Patient,"warning apple they never really said that like they never really knew what exactly was going on, but they did just not like the person, they just didn't like the person so."
741.0,Provider,Because I got some kind of clue somewhere that it wasn't okay.
15670.0,Patient,yeah I think so.
741.0,Provider,"So you might want to ask them how can you see how, first of all, what was it that they saw. Then gave them an indication ask that that friend just pick one friends."
15670.0,Patient,That you trust all.
741.0,Provider,"Okay, so that other person is trying to control you."
15670.0,Patient,yeah.
741.0,Provider,and probably move you pulled you away from your friends.
15670.0,Patient,yeah.
741.0,Provider,yeah I was.
15670.0,Patient,admitted and thinks that I have like nobody by my side and throws it on my face.
741.0,Provider,Right so you're gonna have to reach out to at least one friend just one. And they can help give you. The backing and the strength. To take action. Does that make sense. Does it sound like something you can you can do.
15670.0,Patient,Without eating without feeling I can barely know.
741.0,Provider,"yeah. I mean the coffin your ear um. Well, the one thing that I will say is that you are stronger than you think you are. And you have a lot of of I mean it takes a lot to to. To talk to somebody about the fact that you are in a relationship and the other person is trying to control you."
15670.0,Patient,"Now i'm sorry and I just I feel like there's no escape, but I just feel like there's like like it's either yeah I do I find a way to get out or i'm going to damage myself and hurt myself like i'm aware of that, so it is like it's one or the other."
741.0,Provider,"Okay, so. Like I said look for the things that you are grateful for that's going to give you strength okay. it's going to give you a positive outlook is probably going to shut down the negative stuff in your head, if you can focus on what's positive in your life, then pick one friend. To confide in about what's really going on. and ask them what, if anything, they can do to help you get out of your situation."
15670.0,Patient,it's gonna be hard.
741.0,Provider,"Yes, i'm not saying it's gonna be easy. But sitting there. letting your brain ruminate on all the negative garbage isn't. Is it taking action towards solution right. So just remember that drinking is not going to help us make it worse."
15670.0,Patient,worse. Drinking yeah.
741.0,Provider,"that's not gonna help. Because if you play it all the way to the end, where do you usually end up when you drink. hurting yourself. Right yeah."
15670.0,Patient,Big time yeah. Okay.
741.0,Provider,Do you have the name of a friend that you thinking that you're willing to reach out to.
15670.0,Patient,"I think, maybe one i'm just a little scared."
741.0,Provider,Like.
15670.0,Patient,Like they're busy and they're like you know.
741.0,Provider,Oh well. If they're your friend and they care about you. they'll take time to at least listen. Right.
15670.0,Patient,yeah yeah yeah I guess you're right and I yeah she's yeah I.
741.0,Provider,mean you don't you don't rely on your friends very much obviously so.
15670.0,Patient,"No, I yeah because I else but I need a safe place to go and I, and I don't know where to go and need someone I need I need safety."
741.0,Provider,"Right. And that friend could could probably at least point you in a direction for a safe place, whether it's a place that they have that you can stay for temporarily or. possibly help you find other resources."
15670.0,Patient,yeah yeah the resources. yeah yeah I had one son like that.
741.0,Provider,Sometimes you can. You can get some resources from our case management. team also. Because you need to be in a safe environment but living environment and order to grow and to really work on mental health issues.
15670.0,Patient,"somewhere where it's like making a worse like you're feeling feeling more and more sick day by day, this is not getting any better yeah just getting more and more sick and I can't work we're doing."
741.0,Provider,Right like.
15670.0,Patient,"it's, like the other person here, and it is it going on with their lives they don't understand, like the damage."
741.0,Provider,"mm hmm. So start with a list of. positives and the things that you're grateful for. And then, after you have those written down, and you have a better frame of mind, then you can reach out to your friends and ask when they would be available to speak with you."
15670.0,Patient,Okay. I haven't really seen her in forever. she thinks everything is going fine.
741.0,Provider,But that's because you let her. Believe. led her to believe that right.

741.0,Provider,"don't second guess yourself. there's you when you walk out of the situation that you're in making your measurable, then you have a clean canvas to paint whatever life, you want to have on it."

15670.0,Patient,yeah the. program thing.
741.0,Provider,"You just go to you find meetings that are either online or close to you and proximity. And you just show up at the time that the meeting starts, I suggest you look for a meeting that talks about the solution that talks about how to live without drinking how to grow in life and be a productive person without the crutch of drinking or using drugs."
15670.0,Patient,"yeah yeah, how does the doctor without all."
741.0,Provider,Right. So you have. You have. You may have to go to more than one or two meetings to find a meeting that fits.
15670.0,Patient,That criteria are the online.
741.0,Provider,"Some of them are online and some of them are actually in person, you can find both."
15670.0,Patient,"And do they do, they cost."
741.0,Provider,"No, and there are self supporting through their own contributions so like at the end of a meeting they usually pass the mascot and you throw in what you can afford."
15670.0,Patient,Oh well.
741.0,Provider,"You know it's pretty much know they're there to help support you, through this."
15670.0,Patient,"Okay, so yeah like I see. I see some on here."
741.0,Provider,"yeah. yeah there are several online ones too, so you might want to create a mix of the two. You know."
15670.0,Patient,"yeah and then do you not the offer like. I mean I don't know if the offer decisions, but when it comes when it comes to jobs and it comes to like. Just like finding a job or like just like maintaining jobs or any kind of like job helps does right hard help or there's there's someone like a. Someone that helps with that or knows that's something separate."
741.0,Provider,"And that separate usually there is. Like the same office that. helps with um let's see i'm in Texas, and we have what we call the workforce Commission and they help you find jobs. Through they have a like an online database that has listings of all the jobs that have signed up with the state, and you can go through and find the ones that you're qualified for and go apply. So have usually. Like a State run website that has ads for everybody in in your area."
15670.0,Patient,"Those those state websites, I mean they have job requirements that are like they do, they require like CBS resumes and."
741.0,Provider,"Some of them do, and some of them down just depends on on your field and and what you're looking for yeah late for my position yeah they want to resume and they want your license. Depending it just depends on what you're looking for, and you know what kind of require much usual for that position."
15670.0,Patient,yeah. Okay. yeah i'm gonna i'm gonna get back to focusing just on myself.
741.0,Provider,yeah just focus on what you need to do to take care of you.
15670.0,Patient,yeah yeah exactly.
741.0,Provider,"Now, like you, like you said you're gonna have to have a job. To support yourself, so you might as well find one you want to do. One that you want to get up it just takes work."
15670.0,Patient,to fix my resume and to find like the motivation was she not only you have it's just sticks. And he's had to.
741.0,Provider,Go get up and go make yourself do it yeah. Are you are you on any medication from bright heart.
15670.0,Patient,yeah I was on medication and then I was been prescribed me my medication for the last two seven off medications for the past two days. Oh yeah that's I think that's why been like a.
741.0,Provider,"Nice yeah makes the cravings increase, and it also makes it harder to think and probably a little bit of depression and."
15670.0,Patient,"yeah all those things. And i'm like is something i'm gonna have to rely on for the rest of my life, and when I come off of it i'm gonna feel this bad you know, like."
741.0,Provider,But it depends on Wednesday.
15670.0,Patient,yeah.
741.0,Provider,"i'm because, like I said I don't know what what you're on what medication you're on or anything but."
15670.0,Patient,"I was on i'm not next non next round, which is the one for alcohol I can't pronounce it. Okay, and then on adderall."
741.0,Provider,Okay.
15670.0,Patient,This one for sleeping in. I think it's for sleeping and anxiety.

741.0,Provider,How see on.
15670.0,Patient,Know high drug scene.
741.0,Provider,Okay yeah. Okay yeah.
15670.0,Patient,"Just those three but there, I mean there, I mean, I know that is pretty powerful it's like really like strong so it's like when you're off of a feel it."
741.0,Provider,yeah.
15670.0,Patient,"yeah and just definitely like side effects. So, but when i'm on it obviously it's a different deal it's like i'm more. i'm more kind of like together if that makes sense and i'm like I don't like them yeah numbers last."
741.0,Provider,So why are you not taking Why have you not taking that in the last two days.
15670.0,Patient,"My provider or my there was a problem with the prescription. Okay, like in my appointment and they didn't want to give it to me it sounds like my doctor appointment, which was today so and then she said she would prescribe it to me today but it hasn't been done yet. Okay yeah and then I told her that I feel like it's. Maybe it's more than just that it's one of that maybe it's a mood problem because I moved moved there, so you know up and down up and down like I feel like maybe there's something else going on."
741.0,Provider,I think you may have a little bit of depression.
15670.0,Patient,Myself depression you don't think it's anything like extreme I mean depression is really extreme but.
741.0,Provider,"drill passion can be extreme, but it can be very mild and i'm hoping that at some mile. Because it doesn't see I mean you seem somewhat motivated but not you're having trouble forcing yourself to to do what you needed to do. yeah yeah and and that's really just going to have to be one of those things and force of your will to put one foot in front of the other and do what's right in front of you. And it should yeah I have to push yourself to do it."
15670.0,Patient,yeah yeah you're it and then it's like yeah and it's also just a lot of anger that's been assigned me for it's also I guess in you're going out my partner but it's just like a lot of like anger they're just coming out bursts of anger.
741.0,Provider,yeah at that point yeah you're. you're talking about resentments and those things. yeah those things can be taken care of when you work the 12 steps those things will dissipate and will resolve themselves. and help you though yeah and depression is actually anger turned inward.
15670.0,Patient,yeah.
741.0,Provider,"So instead of spewing it out to everybody else your turn it inside and beat yourself up and that's not okay either. it's not Okay, if we do it either. yeah the way that that we do a deal with anger in a healthy manner, as we accept our part of the situation. and move on and and forgive the other person and go on about our business and if it's somebody that. or a situation that we don't need to be involved with we move around and alone."
15670.0,Patient,yeah.
741.0,Provider,And it sounds. I say you know I can talk it's simple but it's harder to do.
15670.0,Patient,"let's see another person might still not be over my skill to my silver that you might feel like i'm not are not there and then you feel that burden on you elect to fall, like."
741.0,Provider,"Well, if not as long as you go to them and admit what you did was wrong. and ask them how you can make it right. And you're not even ready for that part that part of down the road that's like step number nine in comparison with where you're at with step one okay. So, but. By the time you get to step nine was as a person accept your apology or not it's the least of your worries and that by then it won't be that big of a deal. mean like I did my ninth step with my mom and my mom said I don't want a relationship with you, I said okay. And I mean I couldn't do anything else I said Okay, but you have my son so i'm going to visit."
15670.0,Patient,Okay yeah.
741.0,Provider,"It was me. Not because of it, not because you want a relationship or I want a relationship with you, but because the Court says, you have to let me see him."
15670.0,Patient,yeah so let's try this.
741.0,Provider,"Right exactly now eventually she. watched me and saw that I was in recovery, and I was really working on changing and doing things different. So down the road she decided that, yes, she did want a kind of relationship with me. yeah so."
15670.0,Patient,Okay.
741.0,Provider,It can always be rebuilt. Now.
15670.0,Patient,You putting in all the work.
741.0,Provider,"i'm. pretty much as I did, I did what I had to do to take care of me. And, and you know the relationship wasn't awesome because she wouldn't do her part."
15670.0,Patient,yeah i'm seeing the other prisoners into their.
741.0,Provider,"fight, but she was my mom you know. So I couldn't accept that she what she was willing to give was all she was willing to give and that's okay."
15670.0,Patient,yeah.
741.0,Provider,"there's also people in my world that. They weren't willing to work on the relationship and I I move around, I am not even a part of their life anymore and that's."
15670.0,Patient,And that's okay.
741.0,Provider,"Yes, today it's Okay, because i'm taking care of me and i'm not going to allow that person to beat me up emotionally or physically."
15670.0,Patient,yeah yeah. yeah that's like the worst. You know.
741.0,Provider,you've got to be okay with taking care of yourself. And you've got to know what you need and what you want.
15670.0,Patient,And just think of that and not let anything else get me headspace.
741.0,Provider,"yeah. focus on the positive. stuff focus on your positive attributes what what your strengths are and don't let any of those challenges, get in your way just walk over them or around them. Does that make sense."
15670.0,Patient,"yeah encarta means like i'm ready to do this and i'm like you know writing it down and then I just know that like. Just even seeing my my like I know, as I didn't do it that, but even so Dreading feeling of knowing that like i'm gonna have to see my partner again because, like he lives here so it's just it's so Dreading it's like draining."
741.0,Provider,"Right that's why I was thinking, if you can make a list of things that you're grateful for, and make a list. Of the other thing you might want to say is for every negative thought that runs through your head. create a positive one flip it around like growing up, I was told the children or this be to be seen and not heard so I thought I wasn't capable of doing anything but I wasn't valuable. So that message played in my head for a long time, what I had to do was go back in and say I am capable and so in the morning, I get up and I look myself in the mirror and I tell myself, I am capable of whatever I choose to do."
15670.0,Patient,I love that.
741.0,Provider,"So, eventually, I began to believe it. And now look at me i'm talking to you on the on the Internet, you know."
15670.0,Patient,yeah on the beach.
741.0,Provider,So. that's kind of that's kind of how it works that's how you change that mindset and that's also what gives you the confidence to walk away from whatever negative situation you're in because you can do it.
15670.0,Patient,"Okay, so what i'll do is i'll finish my gratitude list, and maybe i'll like take a shower or something. yeah yeah and then go in the mirror and list of affirmations and really, really, really like focus on those affirmations yeah. yeah yeah positive ones first."
741.0,Provider,"Yes, only positive. Okay. All right."
15670.0,Patient,"Well, get out of this."
741.0,Provider,"i'm going to get us and why Yes, you are. it's a process and it may take some time, but you will get out of it okay."
