You can swallow it it doesn't do any good in your stomach or you can spit it out if it makes you nauseous definitely spit it out, it is all absorbed through the mouth. When you do your first dose I would do a half a tab put it under the very first day you do it cut your tabs in half and do like one every four hours, your first day.
