9371.0,Patient,I did the I didn't have co bed um I had a sinus infection that turned to bronchitis.
304.0,Provider,"Oh, goodness. yeah sick kind of for a while right."
9371.0,Patient,"It was yeah it was it's going to be 10 days on Sunday and yesterday was like the first day I can breathe. i'm not coughing constantly um yeah it's been it's been a. crazy two weeks, because the days I had to take off work from being sick I couldn't rest, because I was moving so."
304.0,Provider,I literally.
9371.0,Patient,"The days off that I had we were like moving furniture, one day, the next day just making trips with back then, it was a nightmare, and it really. Oh, really. stressful, to say the least."
304.0,Provider,"yeah oh i'm so sorry well. It wasn't coven. yeah that's a relief, but. yeah yeah were you able to get like an antibiotic."
9371.0,Patient,"yeah I had the Max to fill in, and I have like one more day lots of that, but then that medicine, it always every time i've ever been on a MAC filling It makes me sick to my stomach so I almost feel like we're for a couple days when i'm on it, but."
304.0,Provider,"If you and you could still probably get some, if you like, yogurt um yeah just get some like probiotic like the live cultures yogurt in that might help because it like it kills the good bacteria."
9371.0,Patient,To right.
304.0,Provider,"So yeah maybe if you could just get some some yogurt with live cultures, but oh gosh so you moved out a new place."
9371.0,Patient,"So i'm oh yeah well the place that I had was chosen for me, because I am in the section eight program so. What my landlord. wanted to do originally is they wanted to remove the two tenants myself and my neighbors because they plan to demolish the home that we were living in and turn it into a single family unit for themselves Oh, because I was in the program they. They just like replaced me at another one of their property. um so I didn't really have a choice in any of it. And things weren't as smooth as they said it would be. I literally had like six days total from the time I saw the unit to move everything and find a place for everything. It was like I literally mean like a real life nightmare. The unit itself is is okay. it's a basement that I have issues with my washer and dryer down there and there's black mold and mildew because it leaks, and when you open the basement door it's like knocks you over the mold smell is so bad. So I called my section eight counselor I guess is what she has her social worker, maybe. And I explained the situation to her and she she was sympathetic, which was nice but basically she broke it down for me and was like it's either stay in the unit, regardless of the issues or be homeless, because. They can't place me anywhere else at this time because of the code that restriction that are not allowing people to be evicted. there's literally like four or five people on a waiting list, who haven't even been placed yet so she was like technically. Your unit that you're in you know I could have gone to someone else but because I wanted to help you and keep you in the program you know I had that we would just you know place you that there so it's you know. The categories, you know."
304.0,Provider,"I don't rock and a hard place yeah, and so I said okay well now that I know."
9371.0,Patient,"it's this or nothing obviously i'm going to be thankful that I have a roof over my head purposes, not."
304.0,Provider,"I mean, can they. Can they treat it like are they going to try to fix it."
9371.0,Patient,"My landlords haven't mentioned anything at all about fixing the mold or the mildew, the only thing that they said that they weren't going to fix it, I also have your tears that lead down into the basement that are broken and dangerous. So they said they will fix that as soon as possible, but they have not mentioned anything to me at all about. finding someone to come in, and you know fix the mold situation."
304.0,Provider,And you know say open that door to go down those stairs they're going to smell it back.
9371.0,Patient,"he's aware the. landlord that husband has been in here and had a painter in here and things like that, so I mean they did clean it that was another thing the day I thought. The gentleman that had lived here was not a clean man and he left it very, very dirty and was also supposed to paint it before he left and he hadn't. So when I saw the unit, I like it almost had a heart attack it was so dirty. I said the i'm sorry I cannot move my belongings in here until it cleans I said, and if you, you know can't do it, then I will have to do it, but that's going to take more time i'll have to clean after work, and you know so he did clean it for me and then he did have it painted. Well, but. It was just everything that could go wrong did go wrong, and then I got so sick is that."
304.0,Provider,I was like I.
9371.0,Patient,"How much more Can I take like. I. was like at my wit's end I just didn't even know what to do, I just had to keep doing what I had to just go to work on the days I could and then move in the evening, until we got through those days and i'm just so happy that I feel better. it's been it's been."
304.0,Provider,"Good and now that you feel better and like your stuff is there and it's clean does it have the. basement is it Oh yes, I do I do feel better now that all my stuff here I feeling better."
9371.0,Patient,And the basement i'll just I have been wearing a mask going down there to do my laundry just you know. really mean. Do.
304.0,Provider,Really really what you would need to go down there for is your want is to do.
9371.0,Patient,"My laundry and then there's a couple things that you know, like storage area I kind of have to clean, a place down there and get my storage stuff stored down there but that's really the only reason that I would be down there."
304.0,Provider,yeah definitely might wear a mask like one of the. Not the masks like we were now but.
9371.0,Patient,Right yeah.
304.0,Provider,to wear when they would be dealing with the mole like the.
9371.0,Patient,"yeah like. yeah it's like um I can't think of the name of it, but I it's like a workers mask that has like the little ventilation thing on it."
304.0,Provider,"Shannon but I I worry like. So what so what you're saying is like the owner so there's only so many section eight vouchers for the county and then there's so many properties, where people are willing to accept a section eight voucher."
9371.0,Patient,Correct. yeah so you're back need your.
304.0,Provider,property owner was like no I don't want to rent this out anymore we're going to convert it to a single family home.
9371.0,Patient,Right.
304.0,Provider,"At least is up, you have to find somewhere else to go."
9371.0,Patient,"Right, where he originally. said, you know. That like they already had it figured out that they were going to place me here I just didn't know it until August. But they had had. been working for a month and never mentioned it to me. So I literally had. Like 33 days of even a notification, that it was going to be happening and then everything came to a halt because the gentleman was still here in this unit, where I am and he couldn't find a place. Because he was being evicted so they could place me here, so I mean I just they are nice people my landlords they really have been very nice and. You know understanding of you know my situation and stuff like that, and so, but this is like the first time that like I kind of feel like they just did this, the wrong way like there was so many ways, they could have done this and that just would have been. Better and easier for me and everybody else involves you know."
304.0,Provider,doesn't section eight have to approve the property.
9371.0,Patient,"They do I. supposed to dawn and she said that she was also supposed to come and do an inspection of the new unit that i'm moving into but she was too busy and overwhelmed. To to to come and do the inspection before all of this, as well, so she said she's just going to get in touch with me. When she has time and she'll come and look at it, but I said well that's great, but I mean i'm already i'm already here and hopefully she'll just be able to maybe. see what i'm talking about for downstairs which is super unhealthy and that maybe she can light a fire under my landlord to let them know that this must be taken. care of. that's what i'm hoping will happen."
304.0,Provider,"Definitely definitely yeah because I mean right such and he has to do their own inspection to look for issues like that to make. Sure right safe, and I mean that's just like a huge health and safety hazard so."
9371.0,Patient,"yeah i've been i've really just everything else, been okay I kind of feel better about the other stuff, but that is that's been bothering me like it's even hard to sleep. I wake up in the middle of the night and try to think of like what, what can I do to make it better before he actually comes to fix it but there's nothing I can do, I don't know."
304.0,Provider,"What I wouldn't Shannon, though, like let him see how bad it is. yeah landlord see how bad it is let your case manager see how bad it is. yeah cuz it's not your responsibility to clean it, I think, definitely like take pictures even."
9371.0,Patient,yeah.
304.0,Provider,"Just because then you and let the you know you let the landlord know, because then you don't want to be held responsible."
9371.0,Patient,Right. And then yeah.
304.0,Provider,isn't that addiction thing going to end.
9371.0,Patient,"The end of this month, she said she didn't give me a specific, but she said that you know once that. rule is lifted, then she said, you know units will start being cleared out and then you know I can start placing people, she said so, then you know, in the future. I can, if I choose to like reapply with a. Like to go through a different landlord have someone that would be willing to accept me in one of their property so in the future, you know that's a possibility she's bad."
304.0,Provider,People kind of start. Getting it right yeah.
9371.0,Patient,yeah.
304.0,Provider,"You know you think, like all these unemployment benefits have expired by now. Right everyone tiring i'm like what are they doing for money."
9371.0,Patient,Like they're just not where I don't.
304.0,Provider,I don't get.
9371.0,Patient,"I don't know, I know, and there are. So many places hiring around here so many places."
304.0,Provider,"And, and I get it like I see both sides like if someone got laid off, you know, yes, the eviction prevention, but like, then, at the same time, like that you know homeowner Orlando, or they still have to pay the mortgage. And they write they haven't been able to collect any money this whole time like."
9371.0,Patient,"yeah that's I know it's not it's not fair for them, and I mean it's not fair for the tenants to well the ones that have lost their job."
304.0,Provider,"And at this point, they could have gotten a new job."
9371.0,Patient,"Right, I think there's a lot of people that are just choosing but I mean it has to run out eventually I can't imagine having knowing like my income is going to be stopped, but then just not have something lined up like. I can't imagine the stress of even that like. I don't know."
304.0,Provider,Like if these people do get evicted and then someone comes with the section eight voucher especially like a single woman like you have good rental history almost that would be like yes i'll take you because.
9371.0,Patient,"that's like guaranteed guaranteed rent they know that they're always going to get their payment yeah. And then my you know. portion is based on my income, which is another thing that I got she said I kind of slipped through the cracks because of coven so I was actually supposed to recertified last year. And that never happened, so my income has changed quite a bit and from when I first got into the program so that's another thing that we are supposed to be doing and getting all my paperwork caught up and re certifying me to find out what my new rent is going to be. Because I don't know even what it is going to be, or what it should be. So I could either be paying too little or too much, but we don't know yet, and so I mean I just like I understand that you know Kobe has completely devastated all of us in some way or another, but I don't know there, I mean. I really hope that again."
304.0,Provider,Worker hasn't like really been on top of it.
9371.0,Patient,"No, and I know that she said, you know she's probably really overwhelmed because I can't imagine. there's a lot of help that she has she probably has a lot of cases she's probably responsible for so many people which i'm sure like you and Dr Steve know. That there's only so many of you, and you guys have so many people you're responsible for so I mean I can understand you know being behind but."
304.0,Provider,yeah that's a small county though you said there's only five people. On the waitlist.
9371.0,Patient,"yeah she said, there was five people that were like ready to be played like within this last year or two years but they couldn't be placed because of the. The eviction rule for the coven restrictions, right now, so I don't know I mean kings county I guess it's pretty vague i'm sure i'm sure she's overwhelmed and and. it's not i'm not. upset with somebody specifically I was just super upset with the entire situation, it was."
304.0,Provider,Just.
9371.0,Patient,It was just like not one bad thing was happening or. unfortunate thing it was like everything that could possibly happen what's happening.
304.0,Provider,"yeah understandably gosh have you got sick like it was just everything at once, so."
9371.0,Patient,yeah i'm fine.
304.0,Provider,Are you still in St Charles.
9371.0,Patient,"Yes, i'm still in St Charles I actually didn't move very far i'm only like four or five minutes from my old building so. we'll come."
304.0,Provider,back their daughter and.
9371.0,Patient,"Yet, but that's Another thing I don't my daughter hasn't been here yet and I kind of am worried about her staying here and sleeping here on the weekends now because I don't want her to get sick. And until they do something with the mold. issue I I kind of just feel like I don't want her to sleep here yet. Like maybe just come and visit with me or i'll go visit with her at her grandparents, for now, and but i'm really sad too, because I haven't seen her in like two weeks i've been sick so."
304.0,Provider,yeah.
9371.0,Patient,"I really made her, I want to see her as soon as."
304.0,Provider,"possible. yeah it's just all around like what an ordeal. And crazy like, especially if you were dealing with bronchitis, like oh."
9371.0,Patient,"It was horrible. And I know a lot of it is. Every year, I do get really sick it's usually around this time, like the weather change and I usually get either like walking pneumonia or bronchitis. And when I get that I get really sick, so I kind of figured it was coming but i'm a smokers you I smoke cigarettes so every time I get some kind of you know, cold or something it always that open my chat. yeah I."
304.0,Provider,"mean I know like I know we've talked about it Shannon and I know you've probably just been busy, but I think if you get your code shot to."
9371.0,Patient,"I know i'm going to. I just heard there's, one that has been approved. By the FDA. Or is that the rumor."

And I don't think i'm going to. stay with it. I have definitely remembered that drunk people are just not fun to be around I mean most from people I guess."
304.0,Provider,Like if you have to cut them off.
9371.0,Patient,"A whole and and the whole like atmosphere of it is i'm just not into it anymore, so I kind of think that in the next couple months i'm gonna. Maybe not do that and find something else. To do. For my second job. For now it's a couple extra hundred dollars. A month so. Okay i'll do it for a little bit longer but."
