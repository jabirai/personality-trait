14955.0,Patient,warble.
214.0,Provider,"not good. So I am going to. make something happen. Because I just think listen it's like anything else in the world, sometimes we go to get reevaluated and we see what someone's doing so listen, we should change that because anything we do could be a huge improvement, and that would be very nice with it. Right so let's take a look at the treatment plan the stuff that we're supposed to be working on. I thought we had an individual session before. We go. sizes sleep patterns."
14955.0,Patient,"are not consistent. I feel like if I go to sleep early I wake up every two hours. Diversity. and Last night I was able to actually fall asleep, but I went to bed. Welcome"
214.0,Provider,"We know your depression, anxiety or high. We also know your focus is off."

214.0,Provider,That you're going to go into the same routine in. Right you're going to not do anything for fun right. Do you not have the time is that fair to say.

214.0,Provider,relationship with your boyfriend.
14955.0,Patient,"it's been good. We haven't really seen each other, because he also has finals finals. And now. He also struggles with depression monson."
214.0,Provider,"Incidentally, chef someone to connect with that kind of understands what's going on some people may not understand what's going on. So I think the thing that we have to ultimately address is this anxiety and depression treatment plan, but I think that's more to do with the provider. i'm really going to try to get her to nail down time and date for you, someone acquire you see that reassess I also think she needs to research ADHD. I think that those two things can make a big difference in this upcoming school year because. I don't want you to feel like this is the way life is supposed to be it's not supposed to be. No um. Are you taking your medication when you're supposed to."
14955.0,Patient,Sit down.
214.0,Provider,"So there goes the ADHD I mean you're you're coming up with classic signs. And I think what's happening is you know you just you just i'm full throttle all the time, but that that that can also send. You into the populating thoughts, like the mind just doesn't shut down and then forget about it too bad day you know, whatever those thoughts are. notoriously heard of it hurting yourself, is there. thought about hurting other people. So what do you think about me talking to the prescriber because this is a totally different prescriber than Sharon work group, are you and, by the way."
14955.0,Patient,Oh 9am on Monday.
214.0,Provider,"How are you making that. Is a tough to make are you paying attention you fall asleep, or you just waking up which one isn't."
14955.0,Patient,"Well, actually no because on Monday is and usually come home early in the morning and it's about an hour and a half drive. So sometimes it is hard to make it but. Even. Sit down and listen. they're. eating."
214.0,Provider,"On your fidgeting. fidgeting yeah I got it Okay, but that's your ADHD and all fellas that that's what it is. I think if we can, I think if we can help that you'll be less depressed I really don't."
14955.0,Patient,know.
214.0,Provider,"Because ADHD is is is overwhelming, and no one understands that people will have it like span I can do everything I just can't complete anything."
14955.0,Patient,Starting assignment is the hardest thing ever it's like I want to do it. But there's a wall right there can get past. And it's because. You know my family my teachers have called. It wasn't really discouraging oftentimes they were getting a lot of trouble. So I think in fourth grade it's probably spent two thirds of it.
214.0,Provider,I don't know it sounds like somebody didn't want to dedicate the time to try to help you. This is what i'm thinking. Because I see something very different. good for you. Are you going home for the holidays.
