740.0,Provider,"If not you if if there's again almost ready man do something. So okay. I feel like this just to have an understanding. Yes, when I asked you have you been thinking about how you might do you say. You say no, but then, when I actually went the past three months question in regards to. Have you ever done anything started to do anything pressing in in your life and you say basically that's what you said, every boss of the driving the car, I wanted to get into the record intentionally. But what i'm going to do leave. And this was two weeks, this is two weeks. Two weeks in August. Which means they basically it happened a month ago, a little bit over a month ago. So when I asked you the question have you been thinking about how you might do this. Basically, was there a specific plan and insane or nay."

You and I will do it together. alright. So first we're going to start off with a warning sign, so what a three warning sign that lets you know better, better hate to the crisis for better prices, maybe, maybe developing."

14681.0,Patient,"I don't really know. I tried to do some of the things that i've done in the past, where I have headspace and it does like meditations and supposed to do, deep breathing exercises. But when my anxiety was so high, it never went away."
740.0,Provider,So did the knitting work. Did the eating words.

740.0,Provider,"Well, does that help or. pain. or well."
14681.0,Patient,"I think that helps me a lot, because I can focus on that specifically. And then knitting I know has helped me. Even just a little bit."
740.0,Provider,"meeting is awesome I think that's amazing I don't have the patience to sit there. I think that's amazing sit up there, and try to. Put the onto the loops and it kind of seven try to twist twist me your fingers in the middle of a bad things about. me that i've been able i'm not even. I can't even so on a button. Okay, so. Obviously, no need for me is this man, so I applaud you. For that, because I think it's amazing. Let me actually was going to be which one is which one is the worst which one triggers your suicide ideation most the depression or anxiety."
14681.0,Patient,anxiety.
740.0,Provider,we're going to go over these real.
14681.0,Patient,Okay.
740.0,Provider,"Coping skills to kind of deal with anxiety, have you ever tried breathing. Yes, the work."
14681.0,Patient,"Most of the time it does um I would say that just during those two weeks, like deep breathing would help me for a few minutes, and then I just came back."
740.0,Provider,"Okay, so if there's practice three to five minutes, did you go alone."
14681.0,Patient,yeah.
740.0,Provider,"Okay. All right, so then doesn't work or does work they don't work."
14681.0,Patient,It it works usually. cuz.
740.0,Provider,I mean something that's gonna work machine to be when it is typify with. intensified like you'd be. Doing those two weeks. yeah you wanted to. You know.
14681.0,Patient,yeah and when deep breathing probably didn't work.
740.0,Provider,"Alright that's fine you know, and you got to find what works for you, so this says progressive muscle relaxation. So by 10 second relaxing the muscles throughout your body, you can achieve a powerful feeling the relaxation. Additionally, progressive muscle relaxation will help you spot invited by teaching you to recognize feelings and muscle tension. So say back or lie down and uncomfortable positions for each area of the body listed below you will take your mother child, but not to the point of strain Okay, but maybe this is something we can do. yeah don't have a patient without without it. Challenging irrational thoughts have you ever done that."
14681.0,Patient,um he is.
740.0,Provider,Under the work.
14681.0,Patient,um. I don't use it that often. it's something that got brought up. With my other therapist and I just I should probably do that more.
740.0,Provider,"Okay yeah and all the reason why, because a lot of times. um is an erratic can be magnified by rational thought so when you have those irrational thoughts and you continue to marinate and meditate on those the rest of thoughts, then it causes anxiety increase. yeah does that make sense, like if you don't fight those thoughts, then the long do you meditate on it, the the the morning body intensifies. yeah right So if I pay myself if I see a bunny. Right and I told my eyes, I said, oh no one, no one. They went I went out there. don't think by the button and get them thinking about they've been chatting and I think my big one, you know what i'm focused on i'm saying. yeah. So, so what they're what they're saying is is that the more you begin to meditate on try not to think of a thing. The harder you try not to think everything, the more you think of it, this will make sense. yeah so that's why a lot of times, you have to be able to challenge this off. So it's not the fact of trying to will about think about imma get rid of that thinking about it and they're thinking about like no that's not it. But what it is that when you challenge this thought and you basically you kind of bring it into subjection you kind of, say, is this really true. right if you say i'm having a really bad day. Whatever it is that you have to do database."
14681.0,Patient,really just one thing.
740.0,Provider,Probably one thing that we have magnified. hmm Have you ever heard of this term called compound problems.
14681.0,Patient,That sounds familiar yeah.
740.0,Provider,"So contact problems disease is that you take one problem and then all of a sudden, you find other problems. inside a problem, and you just kind of combine them with it just. Does that make sense."
14681.0,Patient,yeah.
740.0,Provider,"And so what it says, for example, the thought that somebody does something bad will happen or I will make a mistake might like evidence. But still have an impact on how you feel by examining the evidence this, what I want you to start doing is going to be you got to examine the evidence and challenge, besides, you can reduce your anxiety. Examining the evidence. Now we don't have them assigned to go into it today, but. What I will do is that I want to basically kind of reenact. If you're comfortable. Only two companies. are basically what kind of want to reenact what those events would be the layers of anxiety you say work and you say school. yeah right so both of those are highly stressful which may nine times out of 10 you're trying to juggle to how the stress within the same time. yeah and not take a break. yeah so basically you didn't do any kind of self care whatsoever."
14681.0,Patient,No.
740.0,Provider,"You were just trying to add, like you, you know juggling a circus, but you just have to juggle."
14681.0,Patient,yeah.
740.0,Provider,"Did you go to school, full time."
14681.0,Patient,Yes.
740.0,Provider,"Okay, so you got a full time job and you gotta go without food. they're found like a lot. yeah no."
14681.0,Patient,"worries the school is for masters as well, so that."
740.0,Provider,"Yes, a lot. i'm a pair you with a bad experience before i've worked a full time job and I wouldn't go for time just by getting the master. See when you get your masters they expect you to be a master to get your man and i'm just like I thought I would come out to educate me to how to be a massive. amount like what you already want me to be y. Se I understand because most master's degree programs they make you basically teach yourself. yeah you read a lot, and you write a lot. And you got a whole lot and you got it and they and then and then, when you do it online, you know how you you got to write your posts, and then you got to answer like three other posts."
14681.0,Patient,mm hmm.
740.0,Provider,They make you do that and you're integrating your brand Program.
14681.0,Patient,For that one no.
740.0,Provider,"Okay, good because. I was annoying to me yeah I have a 15 page paper, though. All the things are moving to be this, this is what you're going to have to do you're going to really have to, and I know people say stuff like there's no such thing is balanced, well guess what we're gonna have to create a band, because if you do not create a balancing during body intensifies. yeah that makes me so what you're going to have to do, even if you know that you work full time and, as you go to school, full time do you go to online to buy or by surveys. it's online Okay, and what are your hours that you work."
14681.0,Patient,I work eight to five.
740.0,Provider,Okay i'm late.
14681.0,Patient,"Oh, and I was going to say, and I also have to leave an hour early and I usually get back an hour later because I have to drive to and from work and home."
740.0,Provider,"Okay, so basically would you go to school online you don't have to attend any classes right it just mostly read this chapter do disciple answer this question. yeah okay. So that may you have to you're going to have to really learn how to prioritize your work."
14681.0,Patient,mm hmm.
740.0,Provider,Which means that you're going to have to do stuff in advance. Does that make sense. So if you have a 15 page paper you can do 15 packs you can do 15 pages in a day.
14681.0,Patient,You know.
740.0,Provider,"that's not fast and you can't wait to lead them to do a 15 page paper. yeah so say, as of today, for example, and i'ma let you go but say, is it for today. You look at the computer today, and you realize, you have a 15 page paper that is due on an. The 24th. of September right."
14681.0,Patient,mm hmm.
740.0,Provider,"So if I count 1-234-567-8910 1112 1314 15. So I have 15 days to do a 15 page paper. 15 divided by 15 is worth. Which means that all I have to do is do, what do have many do I do every day in order to make sure I get into about to do that. yeah see if I do one page a day it's Okay, because i'm sorry Aaron I won't feel a pressure because that means I can get other things done, does that make sense. yeah is it realistic so i'm just going after here, I want to see what's realistic."
14681.0,Patient,It it seems realistic to me I just know that in my habit of procrastination specially with my depression like it makes me just want to go lay down like I feel like I have absolutely no energy after work before where like I just need to lay down. And that. makes it very difficult for me to. finish it I guess.
740.0,Provider,"Oh, can I. pose to you a challenge."
14681.0,Patient,yeah.
740.0,Provider,Because first first off in Grad school we can't afford to procrastinate will you. Will you be a master.
14681.0,Patient,yeah.
740.0,Provider,"But. What I will say, is it. Is it possible. That when you get up for work if you say that takes you an hour to get home right. yeah which means you basically get home around 615 18 give or take. yeah, is it possible. To give yourself, because my job is 15 pages this doing 15 days that means I like I do is literally one page."
14681.0,Patient,mm hmm.
740.0,Provider,So is it possible to get you some me. Take you and matt. Get back up. into your paper.
14681.0,Patient,yeah.
740.0,Provider,"But you don't have the situation or know in regards to what time you want to give hiccup. yeah So let me ask you this, when is the 15 page paper actually did."
14681.0,Patient,um. It should be done this month.
740.0,Provider,So you have the rest of the month to get the 15 page paper down.
14681.0,Patient,yeah I actually have a few pages done. But it's taken me about two months to do it.
740.0,Provider,So that's something that you have a month ago.
14681.0,Patient,yeah.
740.0,Provider,"So we have to be do by this month. yeah, so now we panicking."
