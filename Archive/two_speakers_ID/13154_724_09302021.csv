724.0,Provider,"That that's all right. You know, we kind of connected it look like a an opportune time because I went on vacation so it's been like. Like a little bit of a paper chase to catch up. i'm glad you're here now."
13154.0,Patient,I was your vacation.
724.0,Provider,"Oh wasn't bad. Lots of. Lots of running around back and forth like connecting with family my parents are divorced so it's like you get to go see one that will see the other go to the other. ones. And they all live like an hour and a half, away from each other down there so it's like lots of travel lots of. almost like a chore and then after that we are free to do what we want to do, essentially, so it wasn't too bad. Right can't complain it's been a while, since i've been back down there or. home away from home I guess."
13154.0,Patient,"been working stuff going out on fires construction when i'm not doing that and then took up some of your advice you know just stayed up on my weekly boards did some journaling. it's been all right, you know it's had its ups and downs it's I talked to you last which was."
724.0,Provider,"Probably about a month. yeah yeah so a lot can happen in a month, I mean a lot can happen in a couple days to so refresh my memory, you said you're going out on fires you you do volunteer firefighting."
13154.0,Patient,or no it's not long to it's like some my buddy owns like a dozer an excavator. And I run those. pretty much just fill in for like extra staffing.
724.0,Provider,"Okay, like doing like a fire lines like trenches and stuff or."
13154.0,Patient,will do fire lines will do rehab water barring. You know a lot of fire lines to go yeah.
724.0,Provider,Okay that's pretty cool. that's cool and. How many times you've done that in the past month.
13154.0,Patient,"Usually fill in for him, like on the weekends. So, probably three or four times. You know, two to three consecutive days in a row. Okay yeah."
724.0,Provider,what's called you find that to be like rewarding.
13154.0,Patient,far as the day goes yeah it's a lot better than last.
724.0,Provider,"Okay, you get paid to all right Nice."
13154.0,Patient,And and and you're definitely you know you're definitely helping out a lot those those those is cutting blind really fast and. diversifier whatnot.
724.0,Provider,"Okay, has um has a fires and prove that all in California, or they still kind of like out of control."
13154.0,Patient,"yeah it was real sloppy right where i'm at lyrica for a long time is bad and then like the rain son kind of help with that, but they're getting away out of control, like I left one one night, and it was up to about 80,000 acres and they thought it was dying down. By the next after I left you know, a couple fire crews almost got or they call it a blown over and the fire doubled in size."
724.0,Provider,"Two days overtaken. yeah well it's dangerous. wow that's crazy. yeah I mean i've only seen like images and stuff there's like a there's a website that shows you like like we're all the active fires are in the. country, and when you look in California, it looks like i'm like chicken pox or mostly just well I didn't realize it was that crazy and it's all. At the time when I looked at it was, like all over the place, and like man I just had a patient that had like evacuated, like her form and stuff because the fire got real close so."
13154.0,Patient,Right so.
724.0,Provider,that's it's not I mean. California beautiful it's got all those things but it's also got some some environmental factors that. can definitely make things complicated for living for sure. um so you've been finding the journaling to be somewhat helpful.
13154.0,Patient,"yeah like the journal, and I remember, we won't do that so it's just a. Little try to make it more more practice more routine."
724.0,Provider,"Now i'm not like I haven't pulled up your your medical father, did they put you on medication here, since the last time we talked. And, have you been attending the groups and stuff. yeah how's that working out."
13154.0,Patient,"groups are right. there's so many people they're all every different nobody wants to talk so it's kind of just and I, like the lessons, you know I definitely like the when she goes over the. Like like the past couple ones, have been like reframing. your thoughts and ideas stuff like that, so I try to pay attention to that game, what I can from that but. it's just like. can be some confusion in those rooms."
724.0,Provider,"For sure. yeah yeah the Tele health model, you know. What I find is if there's like more than like nine people total in the room, including like the physician that therapist you can get a little complicated, just like I put like the grid format so it's like three across. Like it's easy to like for like I tracking to like connect with people and see where they're at but got some groups or there's like 12 or 16 people managers like chaos, because the second that's like and then it's like and then it says yeah it's a little hectic. Right so big groups are fine like maybe in person."
13154.0,Patient,Because it's.
724.0,Provider,Not.
13154.0,Patient,there's a little bit very not necessarily like on a on a tight schedule to write.
724.0,Provider,"And a delay, you know, sometimes there's like audio delay so like people's perceptions in it is, it can be problematic I find. How many people are in that group, you know."
13154.0,Patient,Various but i'd say there's anywhere from. Nine to 12 sometimes yeah.
724.0,Provider,"yeah that's that's somewhat manageable preferable that's for sure. Are you are you looking into any anything in addition to that, like on the outside, you have like another provider or you trying to see anybody else."
13154.0,Patient,"No, I haven't been like trying to shooting videos."
724.0,Provider,"So talk me through. Like a good day that you had it in the past month, and then talking through like a like a bad day so like like give me like like like a high for the month and a low for the month."
13154.0,Patient,"really like golfing you know so i've been golfing a lot so i've had a few of those days and just just a. freeze my mind up a lot no distractions and I can think and just can do a good, clear headspace can I, like the way I think man, you know, especially. I gotta go on these hikes sometimes after three four days out just nobody nothing, and I can just get inside my head and think, and you know. And then, when I get out to where I can like talk to somebody I feels more genuine when I asked him like you know how are you doing and things like that. Hello. crappy day yeah it's just when i'm in a bad space for sure, and I can't and I, and I try to work on the things that the group goes over and just like you know well reframe reframe your thoughts and stuff like that and. So. Just just a bad day would just be. Maybe starting the day off bad what's the wrong. The wrong thoughts."
724.0,Provider,"So do you try like i'm. Like i'm. Like analyzing a thought like like when you get into like that headspace good or bad right. So doesn't have to be negative, because. We tend to side on the negative and kind of overlook like the positive things that are going on our life. And I don't know why we do that, but it seems to be a pattern that we all do, so you you analyze you analyze the situation and then try to come up with like like. or try to replace them with like healthy patterns, where you're just like maybe if I try xyz instead of hanging out on Q R and S. Maybe I can train myself and do some reconditioning just like reframing. That maybe change the outcome, a little bit differently if you try. exercises like that sometimes it could be like an exercise in futility we were like, no matter what I do the outcome is going to. Probably hang out or become the same thing, but i'm going to try to get to that that point a different way, like a different perspective, you try stuff like that."
13154.0,Patient,"Well let's try to. You know, try to try to read a little bit up on it, and you know I try to say, well, what is this what is this trying to teach me right now and. What can I. What can I learn from it, I guess, and you know how can just try to start like a small positive way of thinking, you know, like small steps in the right direction. opens up this one, you know good and I get back into a good mood. Being grumpy like it at all. yeah yeah."
724.0,Provider,"So you have. Having healthy like like like hobbies are super important so having the golf and I know golf is a it's more than on the surface and just like hitting a ball as hard as you can like happy Gilmore and then trying to. put it in like putt putt golf I know it's way more complicated than than most people don't realize that like on the surface it's a very thoughtful again very analytical game so having that having that skill set and really that activity is going to allow you to. continue to train your brain to really look at things from different angles, if you will, because you got to do it already the game of golf is like a math game isn't it."
13154.0,Patient,it's it's.
724.0,Provider,yep so having that the capacity to think about things like that. should fall into other realms in your life so you should be able to apply like that thought process and you probably do already because most people that are analytical. don't get into like non complicated games like chess players don't like checkers because it's kind of boring to them right.
13154.0,Patient,they'd rather just.
724.0,Provider,be a few steps ahead right. So it's good that you have that skill set already so it's going to help you further down the road as you really start to embrace some of your history and try to turn it into a positive if that makes sense.
13154.0,Patient,Oh yeah definitely.
724.0,Provider,"And then be, you said you go hiking for like days. yeah camping."
13154.0,Patient,Oh yeah. And you saw the stars.
724.0,Provider,Nice you do this by yourself completely like.
13154.0,Patient,"So yeah. If me and my girlfriend go we'll. we'll do like. A thing, where we don't really talk, you know for like about 24 hours and we're just kind of you know I don't know what you want to call it like. This you know talk with actions are. You know it's just a thing I don't know."
724.0,Provider,So it was no. Okay that's interesting select like area. almost like a primitive exercise we're just like. The the dialogue is through. experience. Exactly okay that's interesting I like that. who's who started that her you.
13154.0,Patient,I did.
724.0,Provider,"And she's into that. yeah that's a cool check. Yes, yeah that's. um. yeah cuz I mean like like for guys, you know the the evolutionary psychology trade of being able to operate an entire day with saying very little with words but saying a lot with expression and action is not in line with the evolutionary trait for females which the hunter gatherer. The price of the hunter mentality is lower than your hunting resources like just zip it, you know what I mean so like when you're in. tribes like hunting and packs or just like wolves and shit like everybody has a role that's what like the alpha and omega dynamic exists right and you would think like the first Wolf. In the path that's leading them. Is the one in charge of it's not the Alpha is typically way in the back, and when they spot your point man is your spotter you'll see that thing and it. It passes the message down the line, and then the Alpha actions will come out will break out of the rank and then Paul asked on why. You know, because there's conserving the most energy it doesn't have to be out in the front looking analyzing do all the work the Alpha is there to clean stuff up. You know, because he. Because why, when we get in like groups of guys and stuff. they'll always be like an unspoken rule like who's the toughest guy is or who the guy is when things go bad you look back and be like for sure he's here we're good to go on and we can communicate through our eyes and you know, like little subtle movements right. Good being good women, on the other hand. that's not their thing the hunter gatherers and allows them to like back in the day to go out and procure stuff and pick berries and gossip and raise kids and organized like a little bit of chaos on their end, but they can do it."
13154.0,Patient,Or the.
724.0,Provider,"Words are better, much better speakers, and we are. So find a girl that's more in line was being able to just tighten up and and fall in line and just have like a like non verbal expressions is in dialogue that's pretty cool yeah."
13154.0,Patient,We good yeah.
724.0,Provider,"yeah so it gets it gets back to like those natural natural instincts that we have and being in nature, is very, very healthy for your cognition very healthy. But sleeping under the stars that's awesome it's awesome that you have that i'd imagine that it probably frees up a lot of mental anguish and stress and more people would probably benefit if they had those options. Right that's definitely good. Alright, so on top of that, and the journaling. Has there anything that that's popped up recently that you struggled with a little bit more or that you find yourself writing or thinking about a little bit more than usual."
13154.0,Patient,"No, I just try to hit the journal, with some good stuff because it puts me in a good place and it gives me like I don't know i'm sure i'm sure some stuff will pop up that's just like maybe bothersome a little bit, but right now I don't i'm not trying to like go that way I guess."
724.0,Provider,"Okay, are you trying to avoid triggers or because you're not ready to develop a strategy to deal with them already so."
13154.0,Patient,Maybe maybe I will be triggered or something and i'll go just to the journal to just try to calm down a little bit or even even when i'm feeling good i'll go right in it okay. The.
724.0,Provider,"Because there are stages of like like just like there are stages of grief, there are stages of like trauma and initially like it like what what we tend to do is try to avoid it completely because we don't want to rehash and. You know, just like anything else there's the. You know the denial, the anger, you know bargaining all that kind of stuff. But it's important to. some kind of productive outlet. was alright so. I guess what i'm trying to say is don't fall in the trap of not expressing it like as it. Is not avoiding it because the longer that goes on the more indirectly your condition yourself and not deal with it so. yeah having the journals good don't be afraid to write negative feelings, as they occur in the journal to can all be positive life can all be. No daisies and you know puppies and stuff there are yeah. There are some negative things so just don't be afraid to express those to. Any any. Any medical appointments coming up or anything like that."
13154.0,Patient,don't love them.
724.0,Provider,So work is good relationships good houses good. Have you been keeping up on the surveys. And there are weekly sides one check something.
13154.0,Patient,"To try to get an SUV proof of participation assessment or some of my word that long but. I, and I emailed case managers at bright heart and they sent me something and it didn't exactly. extend out to me the way, I guess, I thought it would."
724.0,Provider,Are you are you looking for proof of enrollment and our program or.
13154.0,Patient,Proof that I participated in an SUV assessment.
724.0,Provider,Who is it for.
13154.0,Patient,i'd be my lawyer.
724.0,Provider,"Okay um. There are assessments here. sounds like it's probably like like a. Call it department, let me see if I can find like the like we have like a court section that deals with like lawyers and POs and the judges bronkart all kinds of stuff like that, so there is a department that would probably have something what you're looking for. yeah definitely for the. On the legal side of things. Proof love. And what is your what's your lawyer want specifically he just wants to show that you did."
13154.0,Patient,"That I did that and they basically send me something that i'm enrolled in the Program. And then i'm took appliance but nothing said that. You know, big bold letters you completed an SUV assessment. But just for like. You know, to show that i'm. i'm out and i'm doing good I guess."
724.0,Provider,Okay. And who the Lord is going to give that to WHO. The court system.
13154.0,Patient,yeah okay.
724.0,Provider,So they're looking to see. About a an assessment and are you doing talk screens here not I mean not that that's going to matter alcohols on the show man.
13154.0,Patient,i'm doing like urine know they're sending me a package for for tests and stuff. Okay yeah.
724.0,Provider,But you haven't completed one yet.
13154.0,Patient,i've done a urine test.
724.0,Provider,I got two different. software programs I go back and forth with. yeah I forgive me i'm a little congested i've been sick for for. 10 days now 11 days.
13154.0,Patient,Just like a cold.
724.0,Provider,"yeah yeah it was cold and. flu like symptoms. So my. my daughter went back to school, like the second week of September and within like you know, a few days of being there she came home with the sniffles and. runny nose and she was under the weather she's just a little feverish and then my son God and then my girlfriend got it and I got it. Okay, I have like some flu like symptoms for a few days for right now. Like a lot of post nasal drip and air pressure my ears. PBS result all negatives. yeah I mean we have some stuff i'm going to email. The Court section. To see if there's like a direct line to them."
13154.0,Patient,yeah.
724.0,Provider,"Maybe that maybe there's something extra. Of. This ud substance use disorder assessment. Assuming it's like the assessment that you and I did initially it's the. Bio psychosocial assessment. was asking for. So this person is pretty good about getting back man so we'll see you email me back here. Now it's just like it like like for like conditions i'm sure it's for conditions when was the last time you went to court. Yesterday Okay, and what happened."
13154.0,Patient,said some stuff and then I have another coordinate November 10th. For like a pre trial.
724.0,Provider,"Okay, is this the first court parents that you've had since the last time you. Talk you have one coming up."
13154.0,Patient,"Yes, I think there's been. The last one was. yeah I think August August August 20 something."
724.0,Provider,What was that.
13154.0,Patient,What was that for. It was just some. Some pre stuff really continuance.
724.0,Provider,"Okay, so like this legal jargon and say anything to you, they just gave you like a like a date and time the show. yeah Okay, and like a lot of software your lawyers deal with. This one came in and they said they said a pre trial date."
13154.0,Patient,yeah.
724.0,Provider,"Okay, when is."
13154.0,Patient,November.
724.0,Provider,"Now, what are they doing as far as. Is it in person, are you doing this all through."
13154.0,Patient,in person.
724.0,Provider,"Okay. i'm thinking that that this appointment here you're going to go in and they're going to set like a real date somewhere in the near future, or are they do, they are they accepted are expecting like like a plea or anything like that."
13154.0,Patient,"um I have an appointment with my lawyer. They set it up. On my car. But. On October 14 at 130 that'll be on the phone probably. Okay, and then. The other part of this price that another day after November 10."
724.0,Provider,So what's the. what's the wire been telling you like what what are they looking to get done for you and then.
13154.0,Patient,they're looking at they're trying to get me out. I can do you know get this gross vehicular manslaughter down to. Something else and then hopefully just get some probation and probably some other. stuff like off the complete classes and you know pay restitution and and trying to keep me out of jail okay.
724.0,Provider,"So that's probably on October 14 was, though. i'm thinking that they probably have something of like a contract or an offer and you'll know more obviously you'll know more on the 14th. And then going into the free trial is probably going to be like where you would agree to the terms or not agree to the terms and then they would set a date moving forward, depending on the outcome of that conversation so that's probably how it's going to play out right. Probably okay. All right, um. yeah so we have a little bit of time, obviously, to get whatever all the documentation that they're they're going to be requesting on our end so. that's good all right. And as soon as you know anything like reach out here um. what's your email in case you know when we get off, I can email you the contact information for the Court section."
13154.0,Patient,"wait for it, why it Fo R it number 200 at gmail COM."
724.0,Provider,So I got wait for it. 200 at gmail COM. start a business email or.
13154.0,Patient,yeah.
724.0,Provider,"Okay. And that's the one that we have on file. Yes, one more about that okay um any any slips or the setbacks, have you drank any since the last time we talked."
13154.0,Patient,has been totally sober.
724.0,Provider,Totally so good.
13154.0,Patient,Lots of golf and just trying to.
724.0,Provider,"golf work and. spend time with the family. yep rinse and repeat that's good man well it's good like again having healthy coping strategies healthy like hobbies that's going to go a long way. you're already pretty insightful you know what I mean so it's not trying to beat yourself up so much you're trying to grow, so you have a pretty optimistic outlook on things so that's. Good that's really good um continue with the with the journaling don't be afraid to. To put more than just the good stuff in there, you know what I mean like like get honest with yourself sometimes if you're in a whole little bit don't take to do that, you can't get out of it. But dig deep where you can start working on some of that stuff because it has to happen. And as you're writing it wouldn't hurt to take some time to read it out loud, so you can hear it, you know a lot of times we have these internal conversations with ourselves and it's very. Very one sided."
13154.0,Patient,Right when.
724.0,Provider,"you hear it and i've been saying a lot lately. and other setting. So, like like when you call someplace and you leave a voicemail and you hear it you're like oh my God that's what I sound like. it's different here, you know once it's out of your mouth and it back into that year on it's good to hear it out loud So if you get some time you even like on a hike if you're out there by yourself, bring that journal with you. and read some of that stuff out loud. allow yourself to get vulnerable and allow yourself to hear you know that way you're not shocked, you know when when it's repeated back to you someday we were like bud. And that happens, you know that happens when we internalize a lot of stuff and then, when somebody calls us out on our shit we're like. Like we get we get smoked a little bit and we're not ready to hear so trying to work on it, try to listen man because it's the the forms of intelligence it's, the only way that we can teach ourselves is seeing reading, writing doing saying all that kind of stuff. If you use them all together in conjunction with each other it's better reinforcement right so. exciting is the hearing. The speaking it, you know what I mean like it just all those things, help and it's part of like the recovery and trauma, and I mean. You got to go through those you got to go through those stages you got to accept some things you can change the behaviors you got to think about things. You get a process, you know analyze develop strategies to deal with it reframe some negative thought patterns, sometimes it's easy to get stuck in those patterns of. You know the bartering and it being angry with yourself you're going to turn that and become turn it into a productive conversation instead of like a like a beat down session like we tend to do. So she hasn't emailed me back well how long. So she said, we need to advise our clients to sign a release of information before we can disclose their enrollment which you probably you sign our I Roi release of information for your lawyer okay done. I can assist you recording which is Laura, can you please someone patients. i'm just trying to get you like, like the like the shortcut directly to this to this department. Almost the reason, sometimes that happens. But having like a point of contact is is helpful when you go Okay, can I just can I talk to so so, then they know what's going on, instead of talking to you know, a handful of different operators, essentially, and then getting have explained it over and over again so."
13154.0,Patient,yeah that's kind of what's been happening.
724.0,Provider,"for everything. Okay. Well i'll email you if she gives me the information, one way or the other i'll let you know what what the path to take is because I have a feeling that she and I are going to go back and forth for a little bit on this email. Just to clarify like Claire stuff up but you're doing you're doing a lot of the right things already, you know that self care all that stuff you're already on like the right track. you're staying sober, which is crucial you're maintaining your appointments with like your you know your legal requirements, which is crucial so you're already doing, like all the right stuff on paper in person. So just keep doing those things like we discussed all right. yeah i'm going to schedule an appointment with you. Right fast let's see. i'd like to do it before. touch base before like a week before your court night. What time is a what's a good time for you, on Thursday, so I can kind of look at see what I got here."
13154.0,Patient,This early for me. We do like.
724.0,Provider,"Five 5pm 5pm 5pm on Thursday. yeah yeah we're going to do, like 515 now because I got a group. from four to five and sometimes it runs over there, a lot of people in there obviously um. So yeah I can do 515 other. October 7 that's a Thursday so it's."
13154.0,Patient,Okay. So that's the. Next month that's a month before my next court date but that's a week before.
724.0,Provider,"yeah yeah that's i'm saying so, like, I wanted to make sure that, like um. You know what maybe. you're not going to talk to me for them what time you're gonna meet with your lawyer on the 14th early."
13154.0,Patient,1:30pm October 14.
724.0,Provider,"Alright, so why don't we try to do October 14 after that meeting so me see if I got like five o'clock on the 40,000 because that'll help. yeah that that's probably a little bit better."
13154.0,Patient,took off work to meet with you today.
724.0,Provider,"yeah I appreciate it. Alright, so yeah I got you down for the 14th at 615 your time. Until then, if anything else pops up, I will email you when when I get back to me with this. continue doing what you're doing man work on those surveys for us make sure that you do those things like once a week um keep going to your group. just keep doing what you're doing you're on you're on the right track all right. josh. You good."
13154.0,Patient,yep.
724.0,Provider,"That was the individual therapy session for transcription for joshua justice. he's gonna follow me at 6:15pm. October 14. he's got some ongoing legal stuff and I wanted to get some clarification, he he requested a, as he said in proof of substance use disorder assessment i'm not sure what that might be, I have a theory that it might be. His bio psychosocial assessment, but I don't know what the lawyer is looking for, specifically, he said that our agency sent a. letter of enrollment but I don't know if that's what they're looking for. So i'm communicating with a without a Carmen to see what we can come up with. No further action."
