Obviously I knew what was going on inside my head and that things weren't right in my. Thought pattern was changing and I don't know, for the past. As long as I can remember i've had about 15 thoughts going on at once, and then in the hospital, I was given a medication that actually made me have like one thought at a time. It was like. Pretty incredible. Because I don't feel good. i'm finally having like one part at a time."

And she didn't take it very well, and she went to social media and started bashing me and my company. Talk poorly about my friends and family and things like that and i've been able to hold on one second my babysitter's. My one of my support team Members over here. At selfie. yeah. Sorry, and. I am not dwelling on it it's kind of incredible to be honest, like my parents read a ton of my mom my back and I told her all this other stuff and then I forgot to tell her that that was going on, because. It just. Was not important enough to take a pet space for me, I guess, and I was pretty impressed with myself, to be honest. Because i'm the one that. obsesses over everything. Be so upset about that was is new, for me, it's a whole new experience."
498.0,Provider,This is a new space for you. yeah.
15810.0,Patient,"yeah completely i'm actually going to take you upstairs now that she's here, I was staying down here, because my son is down here.

15810.0,Patient,"No, no i'm pretty neutral. But I also was self medicating with a lot of cannabis, I now i'm completely sober and so I feel like that's made a huge difference in my life as well. So I I am President I don't know like i'm more. i'm. able to be more present. yeah even my mom was like this is just amazing you are just like a new person over here. Trying."
498.0,Provider,"I bet the engagement that people are saying from you is it's different, and you can kind of filter your way through."
15810.0,Patient,"yeah it's totally different and i'm able to like. I don't know decipher the things like my anxiety levels were so high before like so so high that that's where all the self medicating came into play it wasn't because I was trying to be stoned or trying to be high, or whatever I was just trying to not be anxious. I was just trying to survive. And so I think for me. being more like I mean, to be honest, I was smoking and I wasn't even. Getting high I was just normally out or leveling out because my anxiety was so high, like to the point where I was vomiting almost daily. Okay, when I woke up because the anxiety was so. High and now i'm not."
498.0,Provider,"I don't. Okay, that was my next question any attacks or."
15810.0,Patient,"The first, the first week that I was home yes. But they also didn't give me any anxiety medication and I was on anxiety medication, when I was in the hospital and sleeping meds and all the research that I had done. indicated that I was going to have a hard time sleeping and that it was going to have a hard time regulating. Because of the like I was taking xanax and smoking a lot of pot, but I wasn't taking the xanax all the time I was more or less taking it oh there we go and like. I was taking it at night to go to sleep and I, and then it would help me with my anxiety throughout the next day if that makes sense. But towards the end I was taking it. All the time because I couldn't get my. anxiety under control and that's how I knew. Things were not things were coming to an end, because I needed to get help and my self medicating wasn't working and."
498.0,Provider,mom you're thinking okay. anxieties okay through the day or. Half sleep.
15810.0,Patient,"sleep stocks but i've always struggled with sleep my whole life, and so I don't know they have me on ambien but one of the side effects is suicide and one of my husband's friends jumped off a balcony when he was on ambien. So my husband immediately called the hospital and asked them to take me off of it and just give me literally anything else melatonin whatever like just please don't give her that bad and they refused. To respect his wishes and to take me off of it so. Then I was on know sleeping meds when I came back home from the hospital. And i've been just regulating i'm actually for the first time. Actually yawning and tired, which is a very new thing for me to typically my brain is on overdrive so it never allows me to fully like decompress and sleep and i'm. actually able to do that now in a very different way, so i'm still having a hard time staying asleep and things like that and. i'm a light sleeper so like i'm waking up every morning when my husband gets up to go to work and stuff unfortunately so 430 in the morning i'm like Okay, but i'll lay in bed and try to go back to sleep or not, but i'm sorry my head is just."
498.0,Provider,um.
15810.0,Patient,yeah it's hard for me to concentrate. On what i've been having a headache.
498.0,Provider,that's driving oh. Okay. So that's not a new phenomenon oh.
15810.0,Patient,"No, no, their hormonal so I get them before I get my period. Okay, and I have and i'm super irregular and then, after so the big thing that, like everybody was kind of concerned with is I had two babies back to back like back to back, like, I have a two year old and a three year old and they're you know. moments apart, just like, so I think that one of the big concerns was postpartum and it was something that was never ever addressed in the hospital, which I thought was super weird. It wasn't addressing as how that was something that did occur for me. And I never got help about it because I just didn't think it could happen to me because it took me five and a half years to have my son, so I thought, how could I be depressed over this, because it took me so long to have him that makes sense, like I. I wouldn't allow myself to accept what was happening because I felt like that was being selfish or. I don't know and then after I had my daughter i've definitely felt it I definitely felt the anxiety go through the roof, I definitely felt the depression really sneak up on me. It definitely felt not myself. In the nicest way possible, I just. felt like I was surviving not living. And I was wanting to being a full time mom. And I must win."
498.0,Provider,yeah more Quinn yeah.
15810.0,Patient,"yeah so and my son was diagnosed with autism about a month ago, so all of this is just big things that I haven't had time to. process."

15810.0,Patient,"Just do it in my head that these routines but. say you know well, this week so."
498.0,Provider,"it's not a to do list. Those are those are monumental like pivotal moment, one after another that. it's it's far from a grocery list."
15810.0,Patient,"yeah. So the struggle has been real. But. Being on the medication has made a huge difference, I just wanted to make sure that I got the correct diagnosis, because the doctor only would meet with me for. Once for a few minutes and then start prescribing the medication. And I don't disagree that I, I do believe that the lithium is helping me 110%, but I just want to make sure that if I need anything else, or anything like that they more or less that they couldn't give me my sleeping medication or my anxiety medication, because it was a controlled substance. And that I had to go to my doctor like you and do that, so I was like Okay, no problem, and I said, actually, I want to make. sure that. i'm on the right do things like that last your call."
498.0,Provider,And I think that. With us we'll do a combination of drug therapy and brb. Just to allow you to. get it out weekly yeah but it's real to you. No longer carrying around that grocery list in your head like just a mental check off. practice and incorporate them coping skills. And then. we'll just kind of follow your lead with.

I mean I love my mom dearly but yeah she's had me in therapy for a really long time because of her fears of things like this happening, and I think that. she's not wrong, but you know, there was some things that I think like putting the ideations in my head when it was unnecessary."

15810.0,Patient,"Naturally, and maintained."
498.0,Provider,"My patterns in to check back in on your anxiety. And we can address them moving forward like incrementally because I don't want you don't want to medicate you unnecessarily I love you being engaged I love you feeling engaged. And nothing's off the table, but I wouldn't dare just start throwing pill that you either okay."
15810.0,Patient,"yeah I felt like I was a bit overmedicated in the hospital, because I was taking the lithium as well as like an Anti anxiety medication, on top of that, like three times a day. And so it was kind of a lot. And I felt. Much more out of it. But I also was not treated for any kind of a detox at all, while I was detoxing from the xanax and the. pot, they did not give me anything. So my body went through a very like. it's very intense. And nobody ever did anything about it. there's kind of a joke, I was also violated the first night that I was in the hospital by a nurse in front of people, they said they put it in my chart so I wasn't going to read bring it up to go through that all over again, but um yeah. So, and I just have chosen to not take legal action because I don't want to relive through it."
498.0,Provider,You went through that. Meeting mainly sorry that you went through that. That.
15810.0,Patient,"I just realized that in a place like that they take advantage of people that they think aren't well and I was much more cognitive and in a different place than a lot of patients that they get. also come from a way different economical background than most of the women that were in there and then there's nothing wrong with that i'm very blessed by the life that I have worked my butt off to have and that my husband works his butt off to have. So um. But different like they kept on asking me where I was going i'm like to my home with my children and husband like What do you mean what am I going after this. Because a lot of the women don't have a place to go a lot of the women they send to shelters or things like that or other rehabilitation programs and through that course. that's what they wanted for me and I said i'm so sorry, I have two children at home, and I only have child care for this week. So you get me for a week and then after that you're going to have to take me to court to get me to stay here longer that i'm not adequate to take care of myself which wasn't the case even the day that I came in it wasn't the case. They were very wishy washy and didn't want to tell me when I was going home didn't want to tell me anything and this. The last night that I was in there, I kind of lost it because I said I need somebody to be straight up with me i'm over this you're not telling me i'm either going home tomorrow or i'm not. I need to know what's going on, because my husband's taking the day off of work to come pick me up i'm not I don't you know he works and it's a huge it was his first day he's ever taken off of work ever. Because he makes movies. He can't take days off if he takes days off they the whole production has to shut down it's a whole situation for him. bless his heart but like it's a lot so. He knew that he needed to take the day off to pick his wife up from the hospital because that's what I needed. But they weren't telling me when or where, and so I actually was released at 1030 and he couldn't get there till one because nobody told him and we lived an hour and a half, from the hospital. So it was very frustrating to say the least, to be put in that kind of a situation, it would drive anyone crazy and that's more like I said you're not helping any of these women or this situation by not communicating clearly with any of us. about what your intentions are or what's going on, or anything, and then I was told that I was not 5150 when I was 5150 because I was threatened that if I complained. about being violated, that I would be 5150 and then I was 5150. So they wouldn't let me leave. yeah. wow So for me I just felt like 5150 me because I had ideations of suicide don't 5150 mean because i'm upset about being violated that's just not right in my like. Well guys, I hope to work. you've if you've got the understood, I mean also in my paperwork, it says that I. had problems with my medication and this that and The thing is, is that I went to every group I took my medication without complaint. When they asked me what was going on, I said I wasn't sleeping and this and that that wasn't a complaint about the medication I just wasn't sleeping because I had smoked pot every day so since I was 24 years old that's a lot and. To go cold Turkey off of anything is going to be. Intense for someone's body, and it was never addressed or talked about or anything so it was. inexperienced, to say the least. Okay."
498.0,Provider,"Well, first let me say i'm sorry that you went through that. and"
15810.0,Patient,You too.
498.0,Provider,"And secondly, and let me say that. I hope this is a completely different experience for you."
15810.0,Patient,It has been it has been so i'm thankful for that.
