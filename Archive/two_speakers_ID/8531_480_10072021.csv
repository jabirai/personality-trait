480.0,Provider,"Hello. hello, did you get a haircut."
8531.0,Patient,yeah let's start getting kind of hot.
480.0,Provider,looks good. This is so hot they're.
8531.0,Patient,"kind of between still like. Almost 60 at night, and like 7080 during the day."
480.0,Provider,Oh yeah that's still hot. huh How are things.
8531.0,Patient,"i'm. Okay, but not okay."
480.0,Provider,"Okay, tell me what may not okay."
8531.0,Patient,A lot. i'm. pretty much goes like. Still families. When I mean family i'm pretty much just talking about my sister. i'm just getting tiring.
480.0,Provider,"You guys still not talking, much like avoiding each other."
8531.0,Patient,"pretty much. She came out a little while ago, but she hasn't she didn't get up all day so that gave me the suspicion that she might have been upset last night. I saw was like great. Like because, when she gets upset then mom gets upset and that's what I care about."
480.0,Provider,So there's what happened last night to make you think she was upset.
8531.0,Patient,"When I since i've been pretty much like exhausted, I was passive aggressive so um they went to the store they got their stuff."
480.0,Provider,When you say it's her and her boyfriend.
8531.0,Patient,"yeah and I think they asked mom maybe i'm not sure about that because, like. Oh, what usually we run through like eggs and milk is like the big thing, especially because grandpa just drinks like milk and water and that type of stuff and the kids drink a lot of milk. And there wasn't any when they came back from the store. Which is par for the course for her because she just herself first and then like others later."
480.0,Provider,yeah. Others are an afterthought almost.
8531.0,Patient,"They like when they go to fast food restaurant they go like constantly order out and stop. The the clues I see that she's not thinking about others that she'll like share. Her food with mom like maybe some Fries or something like that, but because she share her food that means she didn't intentionally get her anything you know."
480.0,Provider,To text people and be like hey we're going here do you want anything.
8531.0,Patient,"um well I don't really care about myself i'm used to like. not getting anything or. Not being thought of. When mom but the one that's level and literally giving us like free rent and everything for the most part. Because like sure we give her money but it's not like hey you need to give me money because you need to. it's more like if you can it's helped. So it's a long ways from you actually paying the rent with the very laxest, though, like managers, or whatever."
480.0,Provider,and remind me she has a job or no.
8531.0,Patient,"No, not anymore. Okay, so it's her boyfriend working. um."
480.0,Provider,"So, would you say that was passive aggressive."
8531.0,Patient,"i'm pretty much when my brother went to the store he took my mom and they brought back canvas stuff and I I kind of said, like. hey you actually remember the milk. But. It was a it was more towards a jab because my sister was downstairs. i'm insinuating that they didn't pay attention. yeah. And that is at least what I think the culprit would be if she was feeling. depressed. Which is something that like sometimes i'm like. I see that, like is usually happens and then, like everybody tries to like make her feel good and it's like I don't know if she's actually making it like depressed or making it out to be more to get attention, or to get her way like. there's that suspicion there that's like. That incredibly manipulation yeah."
480.0,Provider,which makes sense because typically your mom does coddle her then when she's in the mood.
8531.0,Patient,"And like. I don't know if she's trying to be sneaky or anything but during like all the these couple months that she's been that we haven't talked directly. I see her boyfriend peek into my room or like steel glances like if i'm in my room or something. Oh no I know exactly if well I can't say exactly how I said I would assume. Because whenever i'm downstairs everybody knows me by like oh I tend to cough a lot because, like my allergies and stuff So when I hear somebody coming down the stairs, whether it be like something i'm watching or I call suddenly or something those footsteps go back upstairs."
480.0,Provider,So she's like intentionally avoiding.
8531.0,Patient,My thing so.
480.0,Provider,How old is she.
8531.0,Patient,she's like a couple years younger than me.
480.0,Provider,Oh man. On this long.
8531.0,Patient,"And it's like so tiring because i'm always, the one that has to like put on the big boy pants or be the mature one it's like so tiring to do that all the time. I like I. Like her boyfriend. Like reasonably well. it's just her."
480.0,Provider,"So, have you in the boyfriend have been okay and talking."
8531.0,Patient,"In the past few months we've been we've been talking like no problem. Usually when i'm downstairs she's the one day usually comes down, I wonder why. And like washes the dishes or like makes coffee for the night or for his morning and stuff. And I usually make an effort to like talk to him."
480.0,Provider,Do you have a lot in common with him like is it easy to talk to him.
8531.0,Patient,not really. kind of he he's not really much of a like person who plays like video games and that's what like a lot of people have in common with me. What I like. he's more hands on. He.
480.0,Provider,Is a hands on like what does that mean.
8531.0,Patient,metal work carpentry like. dominoes hope about cars and. stuff.
480.0,Provider,yeah.
8531.0,Patient,"he's good with his hands, I guess, I that type of personality um. yeah but. The, which is something I have like no shared interest in so it's like. and Like. kind of feel sorry for him. Because he cares for my sister, but sometimes my sister's a handful. Do you think that they're good for each other."
480.0,Provider,Like do you think it's a healthy relationship.
8531.0,Patient,not sure. um. I think it's more one sided.
480.0,Provider,Like he does all the work and puts all the effort in.
8531.0,Patient,"He puts a lot of effort in and, of course, because my sister is the way she is sometimes she'll snap to the lake good and they'll get mad at each other. So that's how I think it's. it's one sided that she benefits from having him around more than he does her. Let me but either way like he's a cool dude like whatever i'm not too much trouble with him. it's just like my sister's attitude that's like grinding."
480.0,Provider,yeah well and like you said it's been a couple months of this which gets really exhausting to deal with.
8531.0,Patient,yeah I like and I made it a point to like it doesn't matter if she's downstairs or upstairs I don't care like where she is it I go downstairs I have my food I help out mom like whatever whatever it takes. And that also seems to aggravate and. And I really think like she really needs a therapist but it doesn't look like she wants to get one.
480.0,Provider,Of you suggested it to her in the past.
8531.0,Patient,"I have. More than once a couple times. But like like we say she can't force anybody else to do anything exactly. And then, on top of that my dad building difficult and i'm."
480.0,Provider,like eating things he's not supposed to.
8531.0,Patient,"yeah I like the last time my mom got yelled at for like his levels being not aware. We had a talk with the social worker that wanted to like I think I already said this before. The social worker wanted us to take our nutrition classes, so we know what to feed them and stuff. But I really pushed. To have the social worker give them a nutrition classes, like my dad and my end. Because they're the ones in. keeping up with the diet. it's been a couple of weeks we haven't heard back exactly he's he said he'll try to like get something like talk to a doctor talk with whoever to make this happen. and also my like. My aunt needs to pick up her phone to like because sometimes there'll be like calling us because she wouldn't answer the phone or something."
480.0,Provider,"Policy, the social work across you because you're gambling pick up the phone."
8531.0,Patient,"might be a social worker, but most of time is like doctors or nurses that appointment, or something."
480.0,Provider,Is he currently staying with your aunt.
8531.0,Patient,"Or is he at your home he's. Back he's back home. Okay, but he's been going out with my a lot."
480.0,Provider,that's stressful.
8531.0,Patient,yeah and it's. My aunt is another door so. immaturity.
480.0,Provider,"yeah. Well, it sounds like."
8531.0,Patient,yeah.
480.0,Provider,"Sorry, my dog."
8531.0,Patient,"You know, right now, it's like she got her car check for smog locally, but she's been going out to Santa Barbara or something to with my dad and my dad, of course, goes and he eats out thought out. and her reasoning was because she doesn't like the smart people that's local and they always are argumentative so she wants to go to Santa Barbara or something. Like that there's more likely or scenario, if everybody's rude."
480.0,Provider,"Exactly, it might be you."
8531.0,Patient,Are here.
480.0,Provider,"Exactly, but she doesn't see that at all."
8531.0,Patient,"I mean do these do people ever see what they. Do themselves rarely I mean, myself included, like we all have that. But here's a question for you."
480.0,Provider,What do you think it would take to get to a point where you are upset when moms upset.
8531.0,Patient,"Oh, I can ever."
480.0,Provider,You don't do the impossible.
8531.0,Patient,"um I don't really like. have a lot of social connections so that's one of the strongest ones I have yeah and like I would do like anything to try to like keep her safe, and all this stuff, which is also hard."
480.0,Provider,So.
8531.0,Patient,"Right now it's like an impossibility, that you would be upset and I would feel like nothing."
480.0,Provider,yeah. So what about just lessening the degree of how upset you get when she's upset.
8531.0,Patient,"i'm. Sometimes it depends, it really depends on what the upsetting factor is. If it's something that can logically be worked through and be done. I mean, I could just like logically map it out for her and she'll calm down and that will call me down. When it has to deal with. More. People involved. With their attitudes and stuff that's when it gets more hairy."
480.0,Provider,"So, like your mom would be upset that your sister has been in her room all day depressed. And that causes you to be upset. yeah but if mom were not in the equation you wouldn't be upset at all that your sisters in a room."
8531.0,Patient,"I wouldn't say at all, I say to a lesser degree. because she is still my sister. Right. Whether I wonder if you're not just doing my sister."
480.0,Provider,"yeah okay that makes sense. i'm just wondering if, like so obviously you feeling all of the emotions, for your mom all the time is. Adding to your emotional exhaustion."
8531.0,Patient,"yeah. Dealing with my sister and my and my like tone. Also, like. I haven't been going up to like for watch or anything that's been like hindering me a little yeah. I have next week, I have a. lab works for a checkup. And since i've been inside a lot. I don't see good results."
480.0,Provider,"Have you been doing with food, I know you were trying to eat better."
8531.0,Patient,um. I am. i've been trying to drink more water and the clicking in my your husband gone down not gone like there. I have been. pretty much the way I cook now it's pretty much like. selman like most of the time. Being the rice. And beans either like. From the pot or reef ride. i'm trying to like not. The effort has been more on not trying to eat junk more than eating more healthy.
480.0,Provider,Okay well that's I mean that is eating healthier not eating junk.
8531.0,Patient,"So whenever I like make stuff it's like the least amount of oil that I can put in with Solomon I don't have to put a lot of oil, because i'm a naturally have a lot of fish oil in it. yeah so I like to cook it that way, pretty much just Solomon and water that's it."
480.0,Provider,really do you like poach it in the water.
8531.0,Patient,what's poaching.
480.0,Provider,"So basically you heat it by boiling it in the water, instead of like grilling it or putting it in the oven."
8531.0,Patient,"kinda it's not submerged in water, so I get a nonstick skillet pretty much that has a matching cover or a cover that can go on it, I put a little bit of water. and put the put the slab of Solomon any so it's not submerge is just the water, so I can vaporize itself, then I put the top on, and while the water heater it's cooking because it's evaporating and cooking all the sun. covered. yeah and once it's. cooked all the way through or a little bit before it turns like because, once you leave it into the steam too much it starts to like fall apart. yeah like right before that point, I would take the top off and. burn away all the water that's in there and the oil from the salmon itself will start to like fry it almost."
480.0,Provider,"Oh, I. need that next time I do salmon."
8531.0,Patient,"yeah I mean literally all uses selman and water, because Solomon already has, is a good source of its own oils and fats. And that's typically how I cook like the least amount least or no sodium the least amount of oil, like all this stuff. When you cook dinner it's like this, when you make the salmon and the rice and the."
480.0,Provider,"beans is this for everyone, or you could just for yourself."
8531.0,Patient,"um sometimes they've already done so, I just got a little bit of something for myself, but I usually try to like. Try to make for everybody, but sometimes they don't necessarily want to eat it, so I end up eating it or my mom. yeah mom. We also make like. it's weird to say soup because i'm not used to seeing soup but that's how like Americans would call it like a broth. I don't know if you've been to a Mexican restaurant and you order soup or well what i'm used to calling it like Aldo. And it's pretty much like either whatever meat broth with vegetables in it and it's pretty much that."
480.0,Provider,"So just like a vegetable soup, is what I would call it probably."
8531.0,Patient,"yeah but it usually have like meat, like a beef or chicken. And it's usually stews like with the with its fats and it gives a the water like more of a substantial taste and then you add the vegetables in there. yeah. I usually don't i'm i'm avoiding eating like a lot of beef and chicken, so I mostly eat like fish and Solomon i'm I really love shrimp and octopus but they're so high in cholesterol, I have to like watch him now yeah."
480.0,Provider,This is so yummy.
8531.0,Patient,"yeah it's my first time actually doing a cooking with octopus. Oh really yeah. I asked mom the other day, and like can you get octopus the next time you go out and. The guy told like there's a guy there that they used to be a chef and he told us how to like we have to like cook it before we use it so it's more to the consistency, because it takes longer to cook. yeah so that's how we did it and the first time it was like the broth I described except without chicken it's more of a. I use shrimp octopus and my mom wanted to use catfish. But we made that a little bit separate because I wasn't sure how catfish would taste yeah India and it went well. And then, after that, yesterday, I decided to make a how I described cooking the Solomon except alongside it I put some shrimp and octopus. Because like i'm going to use the oil, the oil from the salmon to fry up a little bit of the octopus and shrimp alongside it, so I put to the side a couple some octopus. While. The salmon was steaming towards the end a little bit I put in the shrimp so because it doesn't take long for shrimp tacos and then and then at the end or I would put like the octopus and then tried it all up with a with a summons oil."
480.0,Provider,"That sounds so good, I need to try that. Do you enjoy cooking because it sounds like you're like lighting up a little bit talking about this is that one of your hobbies."
8531.0,Patient,"No, not really. I like to like i'm proud, because it came out all right. i'm cooking is not, I would say, I would, I know how to burn things well, instead of just cooking. Because like I don't know what. How methods are what I should put in, or what goes with what I just put in stuff that I think might be interested in hope it comes out like."
480.0,Provider,I mean that's how the most delicious recipes are created people just put things they think go together and then you're like wow that was amazing.
8531.0,Patient,And also like that and trying to keep in mind that. To keep sodium down and keep not only for myself but because my dad also needs to be less sodium in this. Like title making those that agree with everybody. Which is another like fight off because my sister usually just does it for her own taste and doesn't account for anybody else.
480.0,Provider,yeah so what's the plan with the sister situation are you eventually going to talk to her and resolve some of this just keep doing what we're doing.
8531.0,Patient,"Right now, I just. I don't know it's like. I don't want to mess, with it, as long as it's like relatively fun."
480.0,Provider,"It makes sense, fair enough."
8531.0,Patient,"and Like but, like so hard and advocating is like i'm exhausted I don't want to it's like. All their stuff."
480.0,Provider,"Well, and you know that you're gonna have to be the one to give in and apologize, even though she should be the one. And that's the hard part of it is like you're never gonna. it's never going to feel like a adjusted type of situation."
8531.0,Patient,With.
480.0,Provider,The resolution it's going to be you basically just giving her a pass and continuing to ignore her problematic behaviors.
8531.0,Patient,And it doesn't matter like what she says she's gonna try like I know what's gonna happen.
480.0,Provider,"So it's almost like as if you know that, having some sort of conversation with. Her isn't going to be productive anyways so you might as well just keep doing what you're doing."
8531.0,Patient,"Like the half the time isn't. yeah and a half, that it is it only lasts for like a couple months and it'll slowly revert back."
480.0,Provider,"That makes sense. Which is unfortunate, to accept about a family member because, obviously, we want to believe that people are wanting to grow and change and be self aware and. have effective interpersonal relationships, but like you said before, to you can't force anyone to change and you've known her long enough to know that she's not there yet yeah."
8531.0,Patient,Like no progress has been made to make me change my mind on that. And that's the part that's tiring.
480.0,Provider,yeah for sure.
8531.0,Patient,Because like even now it's like annoying that she's acting like a child and being at the edge that we are.
480.0,Provider,Oh yeah adults acting like children is like my biggest pet peeves. yeah it's hard to handle and especially hard to handle when it's someone living in your House.
8531.0,Patient,"yeah and it's like. And I consider myself to be like childish too, because I don't have a lot of outside experiences, because most of my time it's pretty much dealing with. Just this and being in my room playing video games."
480.0,Provider,But you're still a responsible adult taking care of a lot of other adults in the House so that's.
8531.0,Patient,The difference.
480.0,Provider,"Is you might not have experienced, but you have awareness, you have insight, you have the ability to effectively relate to other people."
8531.0,Patient,Effectively relate to certain people I don't think i'm literally literate socially enough for that broad of a term.
480.0,Provider,"Okay. Well, I think you can effectively relate to other people, even if it's only a couple people, because that is not a matter of. being equipped enough to relate to other people it's your own past trauma and choosing not to relate to people, you know. As you've told me so many times before you're very observant so you study people before you even talk to them so. That would make me believe that you are pretty literate socially."
8531.0,Patient,I think that's why I think i'm illiterate.
480.0,Provider,yeah but it's the opposite. you're probably much more aware than most people.
8531.0,Patient,yeah being aware yeah totally.
480.0,Provider,You just choose not to engage based on your awareness.
8531.0,Patient,"yeah. Sometimes it's like so flustered because I don't know what the right choice would be. Because it was like it's like when you're in a Buffet and there's like so many foods, you want to eat, but your stomach only holds almost like Blair, what do I pick yeah like so many options I don't know which route to go down, I mean."
480.0,Provider,"Oh, my gosh my dog is so needy he's literally like sitting right in front of me, looking at me with these eyes, like stop working already."
8531.0,Patient,yeah.
480.0,Provider,"hey one more it's Okay, so I will see you tomorrow. I do have another one here already. And we have our other October appointments scheduled in two weeks."
8531.0,Patient,A day. 21st 21st yeah yes. Perfect okay all right i'll see you tomorrow.
480.0,Provider,See you tomorrow bye.
