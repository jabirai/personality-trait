16477.0,Patient,"A lot better now i'm stressed a little bit, but."
740.0,Provider,Why.
16477.0,Patient,Not just because of the hassle of the day.
740.0,Provider,What happened today.
16477.0,Patient,"Well i'm saying I was you know I checked in at the. brilliant none all that stuff so. that's the kind of stuff that gets me agitated you know, unfortunately. So. I feel. anyway."
740.0,Provider,"well. um. But like I said I do apologize, apparently, they said that you checked in early with the hosting and literally right away so. I wish I had control over the kind of stuff I don't but. But I did, let them know I did, let them know that you did express your agitation with the process, and so, hopefully, they can be able to fix that moving forward. But you know things happen i'm sorry we take. Technology goes."
16477.0,Patient,You know anxiety and stress what i'm working on.
740.0,Provider,"And this is a perfect you know, this is a perfect situation for you, Mr. Because you know the crazy part of it, thank. You i'm saying. I didn't do it, but I understand."
16477.0,Patient,I used to. I used to be much Melbourne.
740.0,Provider,"I understand. However, has everything been going since the last time we made."
16477.0,Patient,"Doing okay i'm working doing this uber stuff now again so. Okay, that has me doing you know least i'm doing some stuff now."
740.0,Provider,Right now you're getting out the House.
16477.0,Patient,yeah so that helps you know. So you're driving people around your lot of them don't want to talk with you. hmm it does remind me them. i've good customer service skills. Now my rating is like 94.98. You know i've always been pretty good at that. So there you go.
740.0,Provider,"So um how has outside of today's and city, but how has your stress and anxiety level been overall."
16477.0,Patient,"Whenever there's something I have to do, I do I get I get, I feel that anxiety, you know, like. Okay, my to get car inspected last week."
740.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16477.0,Patient,"Just like all that idea of. You know, maybe it's the idea of thinking, the worst. Right like it's going to fail or it's gonna be a problem, you know that kind of stuff so that's the kind of stuff i'm trying to change. The way I think I guess. I wasn't always like that, but i've you know I could I could always get stressed out someone."
740.0,Provider,"Someone going to actually do that, they just hit like just a straight to it um. So I like this activity, because of the fact that it actually kind of helps the process. In reverse to anxious worry and things of that nature and so that's something that I hear from you a lot in regards to be projecting what could happen, and all that stuff, so this is how what could happen versus what will happen. So it says when you are worried about something it's easy to imagine the worst thing that could possibly happen in reality, these worries may never come true what could happen isn't the same as what will happen. Right so. The question as this, so you tell me what is something that you're worried about. Or what are some of your worries."
16477.0,Patient,"Right now, and I mean it's just come up when they come up was when I."
740.0,Provider,"Know let's use it let's let's use the uber driving thing you said when you have stuff to do. that's when your anxiety comes. Well, so let's use this situation."
16477.0,Patient,The simple past stressing me out for some reason.
740.0,Provider,"Okay, so was one of the most recent tasks that you had the stress you out."
16477.0,Patient,I guess. My father's computer died and I had to go to get a new one i'm really good at thinking of doing computer stuff.
740.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16477.0,Patient,"So I was, I was kind of stress thinking, all we got to go through this process. That one wasn't so much as like that the thing with the car getting inspect it was a little more stressful because. If the car if I don't get the car passed and I don't make any money."
740.0,Provider,"yeah I want to you, I want to use this scenario, I want to use the car scenario. Right okay so something that she was worried about was the car breaking down or."
16477.0,Patient,"Not breaking down, but you know not passing inspection, then you can register so."
740.0,Provider,"Okay, so Cardinal fan inspection not able to get it registered they're not gonna be able to drive i'm not gonna be to make money okay okay. So that's something."
16477.0,Patient,"We and it's funny because it's leading up to it a couple of days before. That was where I was most thinking about it. Okay, on the day. i'm kind of getting over there i'm like I felt better about it, as I was getting, I guess, I was in the process of doing it, you know. so little calmer that point I don't know."
740.0,Provider,"And it makes sense right because the thing about it is, is that when you live in the world of what could happen. Then it always it basically seems to it seems sometimes not always, but it seems to overshadow the rational mind of what's going to actually happen. Because you don't really know what's actually happening to you get there, however. Sometimes you can worry yourself, you can wear yourself into a panic. And being. The crazy part about it, is it end up happening completely different than what you thought."
16477.0,Patient,Where does it come from you know that's the question.
740.0,Provider,"Well, it could come from a lot of different things."
16477.0,Patient,"Is that. Even though most of time it all works out, and I know that but I don't remember that I guess."
740.0,Provider,"yep because I brain sometimes you know it's shaped to be able to snapshot the negatives, and then, mind you, if you even though and the crazy part about this. Is it the fact that things didn't work out the funny part about it is, is that we don't remember we don't seem to remember that part we just seem to remember the anxious and the panic and worry."
16477.0,Patient,mm hmm.
740.0,Provider,"So that's what the brain that's what the brain. retains the most. Right. And so. So it says it says thinking about what will happen, instead of what could happen can help you worry less. right they really can because the thing about is that this is that you have no power on what will actually happened. You don't know. I mean you could you could you could jump a you could jump to an assumption as to what could happen, but you don't really have any proof. and see that's The thing that you need to look for the most is that you need to look for the evidence in this right, so we say what could possibly happen. Is that my stuff don't pass and then I can't get my car registered, and then I can't drive and i'm not going to be and make no money, I need to make money, I need to get out I need to do all right. Now, my question is this what fruit and whatever it is, did you have leading up to what proof and what evidence, did you have that you're not gonna pass."
16477.0,Patient,"The only thing was I just knew I needed a tune up. i'm also thinking about something now as you were just talking about that, I guess, it also has to do about wanting to have control all the time. mm hmm because that's something like that I don't have control over."
740.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16477.0,Patient,"But I want to have control or I guess that's part of it, too, is where some of the stress to come from."
740.0,Provider,"that's a really good observation was to give for real without because the thing about it is, is that this if they do you know the crazy part about it is that people stress and where we over things they can't control more than over they they can."
16477.0,Patient,Of course it makes sense now that we're talking about you know thinking about it.
740.0,Provider,"So, and now, and the thing about it is, is that when we try it and see see um and a lot of times and i'm so happy that you identify this i'm still having to do. Because a lot of times with control is really hard to relinquish it to somebody else because we don't trust them we don't know the kind of work that they'll do we don't know what they're capable of if they don't do it, how we want them to do it. So. it's more so about relinquishing control. easier said than done, of course. Right, but they have you i'm sure you've heard of the serenity prayer before."
16477.0,Patient,"yeah I know. that's part of that sobriety thing to the you know, let me have the wisdom to. Remember the words is that because it's been a while, but."
740.0,Provider,"God grant me the serenity, to accept the things I cannot change. Right tears to change the things that I can, and the wisdom to know the difference."
16477.0,Patient,I guess I gotta get a mantra going on.
740.0,Provider,"Yes, and see the thing about it is is they, my question is just my question is this was to get that out actually the question are you able or do you feel like you have the capability to accept the things you can't change."
16477.0,Patient,"I believe so, yes."
740.0,Provider,"Well, if you came, then why don't you."
16477.0,Patient,Remember that right that's the yeah. You gotta train yourself.
740.0,Provider,uh huh.
16477.0,Patient,"I mean that's part of meditation as well, I know it's. Right doing the things that you need to do every day. To practice so when stuff comes up, I mean I realized that my you're like you were talking about putting little notes on my."
740.0,Provider,wall yes yeah. Did you do.
16477.0,Patient,"I haven't done that see. I wrote down the stuff we talked about and I, you know. started making my bed, for example. One thing, but I didn't put up the notes that I need it like this, I need to put that note up right today about this that serenity prayer. or serenity, I guess it's got a prayer right."
740.0,Provider,"Sure, whatever Randy statement is just serenity whatever, but let me ask you this so let's take a commercial break so, how does the bed making go ahead, do you feel after you start making a bit."
16477.0,Patient,"Better I don't do it, like the same you know because I don't have that I still don't have that morning routine where I have a go at night, you know. Yes, it's been mostly it's been the weekend. yeah so it's not like I have you know get up at 830 every morning, but you know go to work so."
740.0,Provider,yeah.
16477.0,Patient,"So right now it's just been sometimes it's 11 o'clock. You know, sometimes whenever. I missed a couple days but i've been doing it, you know."
740.0,Provider,"Okay, listen, as long as you're doing it, and the more you do it, the more you want to do it."
16477.0,Patient,"But say i'm working on my whole room, so you got understand my room is a total mess so i've been. All about people. In and up all this paperwork and all this stuff. accumulated over that couple years at during it I got told that I was drinking every day. So it's like a you know and sometimes I look at stuff like that and say. it's a mountain."
740.0,Provider,"But you know the crazy part about it is, is that if you make your bed then they'll make you want to start tackling other little projects in your room, because then you better look Nice and then you look around at the rest of the stuff but like oh."
16477.0,Patient,I know. I do know that that makes you feel so much better when stuff is.
740.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16477.0,Patient,fung Shui. I mean it is.
740.0,Provider,"It is about it to be clean, because the thing about it is to give it i'm just gonna be honest with you. You know i'm saying and see and see you know me personally, my anxiety comes up when there's miss I can't operate in chaos like stuff has to be organized like if stuff not organized like a. close and I followed a new dishes and I wash if the flow look crazy and other stuff needs to be done, that that bothers me, it makes me anxious like it messes with my OCD really, really bad. yeah so so it has to be done right but, and I say this to say this to you if there's sometimes as well, sometimes your anxiety or your stress and you're worried, can also be contributed to the chaos dizzy this in your living environment."
16477.0,Patient,"Right Oh, I know, and I think sometimes it has to do with my new back then, it was basically the thought that you know I think I told you before that was that feeling I had during this. last few years it's like what does it matter. yeah no. I would want where's that what's the point i'm not getting any i'm not getting anywhere and all that kind of. that's The other thing to tackle obviously is."
740.0,Provider,There defeating behavior.
16477.0,Patient,"yeah just having a purpose like I said before, when I had that the goal of being in a band and. hmm I had that as a, even if I had a menial job or whatever it didn't matter because I had, that is, you know something to look forward to. Take care of itself, the rest of my life, you know."
740.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16477.0,Patient,"This point i'm 55 and I don't have any I don't have any savings and it's like so things like that would free band, you know. yeah so that's what made me I think just kind of like give up on. taking care of myself and I. And I feel better, but not that bit by bit over the last few weeks, you know."
740.0,Provider,it's good.
16477.0,Patient,"You know the well i've been doing that wellbutrin I guess for about three weeks now. It seems like I don't feel quite as I feel better for sure, I think."
740.0,Provider,that's good.
16477.0,Patient,"month ago, or whatever. Like I said, but those stressors definitely. like this morning that's why I knew was a good example, when I started feeling, as I was, like trying to get this thing going today. yeah don't don't mean i'm just like I was thinking myself what is wrong with you."
740.0,Provider,let's see let's see that. yeah great great. Again this is.
16477.0,Patient,going to stay because it's also you know. Maybe because that's why I wanted to do a morning session with you. When I feel my weakest.
740.0,Provider,yeah but see the thing about it is that's also part of that control and when things don't go according to how you expect them to go. yeah yeah i'm saying and see.
16477.0,Patient,I gotta put this i'm gonna put a bit I know. I got a little.
740.0,Provider,"Time and this is what i'm going to tell you i'm going to encourage you, with this, Mr Gilbert is this, is that you have to leave room for buffer. Right, you have to be able to put that buffer in there. Right, because sometimes things are not going to go the way that you expect sometimes and the good thing about it is it's good that you're a planner it's good that you're it's good that you have. That you plan things and that you that you have things that you that you have things that you would like to go a certain way and that's it that's a really, really good thing, so I never tell you to take that I never tell you to eliminate that I think you should continue to do that, however. At the same time, I think you should also create buffers, just in case. and basically what I say, when I say buffer is to leave room for incidentals. Leave rooms for those for those mishaps, you know i'm saying it is is is one of those things outside of outside of being a therapist we also do real estate right and so with with real estate, you always gotta leave room. For incidentals things happen right people lose their jobs, sometimes people pay pay rent sometimes things like that you know, so you have to leave room. You know, so you have to create a buffer and i'll encourage to say I encourage you to do the same thing is that sometimes when things don't go your way or when you feel yourself. Losing that control or things like that, if you have that buffer in place, then what that does is it can cause less worry and less stress."
16477.0,Patient,Little buffer you're talking about something memento buffalo.
740.0,Provider,"rush a mental buffer right and it's just one of those things you have to put it, you have to put up there alongside your expectations, when you say stuff like okay. Well, you know I need this to happen, and I need this to happen, I needed to happen this way and I want this to happen this way and things like that. And so, then you create that mental buffer you say, but so you know what, but let me tell myself and then remind myself that it's Okay, you know things don't happen, the way that I want them to happen as long as it happens. Then i'll take them. And that's that's that mental buffer right there does that make sense."
16477.0,Patient,yeah. Again it.
740.0,Provider,"is just the wisdom to know the difference. In being able to create it so. This is what I would say so let's go around about question. So my round about questions is when you're worried about something when you're stressed about something or you become anxious about something. Do you feel or do you have evidence to back it up, or do you feel like they're your worry and you're anxious news is just because of the fact that you want to control it, and you came."
16477.0,Patient,"In last weekend control because I when I like I said, most of the time I can logically say to myself most the time it does work out past experiences i'm sure it has been disappointments are things that didn't work out. Right, but I can logically say to myself, the majority of the time it's all good it's all."
740.0,Provider,"Okay, with this."
16477.0,Patient,"I don't know, I guess, it is a control thing is a big part of it."
740.0,Provider,"I think it is, I think, is a really big part of it in the fact that you were able to identify I mean I think that's amazing really you know really intrigued me, but at the same number, however, at the same time, I will say this because I like this question, right here. If you're worried does come true, how will you handle it and will you eventually be okay. So if you are worried about something and the thing the exact thing that you're worried about actually happens. How will you handle it. And when do you feel like you'll eventually be okay."
16477.0,Patient,"To say, sometimes it takes me a long time, get over something."
740.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16477.0,Patient,"I know I eventually will. Right yeah, it is hard me to brush something off. So that's the question I guess that's something I get I got to work on. That I know i'll be okay eventually. Right depends on the impact of what it actually it is."
740.0,Provider,Right. hey yeah.
16477.0,Patient,"Well, the biggest thing I just had obviously was just hard thing that happened to me. But once, when I was when I was thinking about I might need to go to the hospital, of course, I was freaking out, so I started reading about symptoms and. Right realize, I was having you know looks like I was having congenital heart failure or not congenital."
740.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16477.0,Patient,"Once I got to the hospital. I got more and more stressed, because I realized, you know they got because they were getting more concerned, obviously, and they removed me through quickly."
740.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16477.0,Patient,"Once it all happen. I finally got calm. Right once once I released, I once I gave over to the fact that, yes, you're going to be in the hospital, this is happening and. you'll get through it somehow I just at that point, I actually felt much calmer in the hospital, I told you before. I realized, because once I got back to the my house."
740.0,Provider,yeah.
16477.0,Patient,"I started feeling much more stressful because the place is a mess and I was like i'm back to my old, I guess, I felt like I was at a different when I was in school I didn't have as many worries I didn't have to worry about anything just just get better and. So I was able to kind of release myself to that. So. I don't know and I got I had people telling me that was. I forget who it was. That I couldn't be right now even since I got out of the hospital kind of experiencing ptsd."
740.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16477.0,Patient,"i'm just going through all that you know. There was a time where I couldn't sleep well at all, because I was afraid I was going to just I couldn't breathe, or something. And shortness of breath that I felt. Eventually, that one away. I don't know."
740.0,Provider,"And that's the thing you just have to take it, piece by piece everything that you went through it was traumatic like that is a traumatic thing you have to face something like that. You know, with it, not even expecting it, you know, considering that that you try to live a healthy life and you try to do right and eat right now the kind of stuff and then it still happens to you."
16477.0,Patient,"So, like I said before, leading up to that. I was almost like that I wasn't really suicidal but I was definitely when I was drinking every day and smoking cigarettes, I was at the point where I was like I don't even care if I die. Right right and then, of course, then when it came up like wait a minute I don't want it. You know. So I guess it was a it's a wake up call, obviously."
740.0,Provider,"And you know, sometimes we need those."
16477.0,Patient,"I know i'm saying, sometimes you gotta get down to the bottom. You know it's still functioning to a point, you know. they're they're doing much because I didn't have to do anything I was just. On appointment. You know, made it very easy."
740.0,Provider,To give it I got a question.
16477.0,Patient,call me brad please.
740.0,Provider,"i'm sorry Bray. yeah I got a question. So my question is this because the sound like you really hard on yourself, I mean you really hold yourself, or you. You I mean you really be beating yourself up man I tell you I mean it's tough it's hard to hear, so I guess my question for you is when do you feel like you've got to get to the point to where you're going to forgive yourself."
16477.0,Patient,"that's a good question I don't know I think that's what i'm working on right like you said you gotta be patient i'm just not going to change overnight. Right, we got to work through it."
740.0,Provider,right we gotta wait.
16477.0,Patient,"What one of the things I was because I felt like a failure and. With that whole music thing the fact that I didn't see a future, you know. Right I just you know just. All I could think about was and I had friends who were making a younger friends, making more money than me and all that kind of stuff was just like hit me like. Where am I going to be in 10 years. mm hmm but i'm 65 now coming up and say."
740.0,Provider,I don't feel.
16477.0,Patient,"Good about it now i'm saying. Right, but I was hitting me every day."
740.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16477.0,Patient,"So, and I felt paralyzed so."
740.0,Provider,"I you know, even now, you know this is do nothing to go pick up your instrument and and go play, and one of them jazz clubs or whatever them allowances or not it kind of."
16477.0,Patient,Mine i'm playing i'm playing music and my friend we're gonna play guitar so. So that's. that's.
740.0,Provider,that's good.
16477.0,Patient,"yeah. Anyway, I just feel like there are. Issues I got there's a big issues I got to work through right now. And I know so it's like getting. If I hadn't I know it's not even this. is a really nice job, everything will be fine. Right, which in some ways, true, but then again there's always. there's this other stuff that's could always get in the way of that."
740.0,Provider,right because.
16477.0,Patient,Money money doesn't buy happiness I realized that.
740.0,Provider,It doesn't.
16477.0,Patient,You know.
740.0,Provider,"And, and the thing about it is that yeah you can get a good job sure you can you can work, you can work to you 75 and retire. Right, however. At the same time, what happens if you go to your job that's a really good job. But then, you still you already still you know you were exploited beating your own self up, so what happened if you don't perform the job like you think you should, and then you start beating yourself up and then, and then you begin to you begin to regress."
16477.0,Patient,I know yeah exactly that's what i'm saying I know it's more than just having that there's plenty people good job that are you know.
740.0,Provider,That you wrote.
16477.0,Patient,behavioral problems.
740.0,Provider,right they have great down cell phones can be suicide all this kind of stuff it's a lot.
16477.0,Patient,"Right. Anyway, so. i'm gonna work on that so anything that's, the first thing I got it."
740.0,Provider,"Yes, let's work on it, so this is what this is what I want you to do for homework."
16477.0,Patient,yeah that's fine call it a.
740.0,Provider,"lot more homework I finish the other but. I wouldn't do. This for homework, I would like, for you to do the serenity to write down the serenity prayer and and I want you to tell me what it means to you. And how and how you can apply it to your daily life."
16477.0,Patient,mm hmm.
740.0,Provider,So write it down tell me what it means to you and how you can apply it to your daily life.
16477.0,Patient,"Well, I was gonna write it down i'm gonna stick it on the wall so."
740.0,Provider,Perfect that's fine.
16477.0,Patient,that's what I gotta do. We gotta remind myself.
740.0,Provider,"Even, even if I can find if I can find where they said the sign in big jumbo little Do you know what i'm gonna say here you go brag on his website and by the sign and put it up on your little boy, you are."
16477.0,Patient,obscene and my grandma had in her house. hmm kitchen or something I was like.
740.0,Provider,yeah. So that's what I want you to do we're going to start there.
16477.0,Patient,Alright that's good. i'm glad you're glad you brought uh. mantra whatever you want.
740.0,Provider,"Whatever you want to call it i'm not going to Title it for you i'm gonna let you title it for yourself, but we can definitely start there because there are a lot of things. That it's basically a a statement of acceptance. and see that's one of the hardest things to do is to accept. And it's also a statement of relinquishment and that's also a hard thing to do is to relinquish something they should want to hold on to the to accept something that you don't want to accept."
16477.0,Patient,I didn't understand it i'm starting to understand.
740.0,Provider,hmm.
16477.0,Patient,I would know what I think it is.
740.0,Provider,"brad do you have your next session, do you want to go ahead and schedule it for you to be happy, and I promise you, you won't be won't have no issues next time i'm hoping that we don't have no issues next time."
16477.0,Patient,"i'm gonna ask you, though, that way, why does it always have to be through the. lobby and then the blah blah."
740.0,Provider,"blah Okay, so this is why right because this isn't sharing they charged her insurance every time, so you have to go through them in order so that they. yeah."
16477.0,Patient,"I think I think the first time I met. Tommy. hmm me a direct line to her. that's why I was wondering why every other thing I was been through, I guess, I see what you're saying."
740.0,Provider,"yeah because festus, this is the end of the year, going into the New Year. But mostly and that's what they that's, this is what they told us, because we had a meeting about it, the other day.
