4754.0,Patient,morning.
726.0,Provider,Good morning. what's.
4754.0,Patient,That.
726.0,Provider,look like you're you were crying.
4754.0,Patient,"No, no, I just woke up not yet not crying yes. I promise. i'm just tired."
726.0,Provider,"Oh alright oh yeah It is early i'm sorry i'm three hours ahead of you from your time zone so that's why my time on like, but I know it's too early for you so."
4754.0,Patient,yeah it's okay. i'm not like sleeping really greatly so.
726.0,Provider,How we how how was your week.
4754.0,Patient,"Like worked out from. yeah that's good. And yeah i'm like stressed out still but. try not to like focus on that, like the husband stuff. Still restriction Europe."
726.0,Provider,Like you're still in that apartment I your landlord put you in a guest for now.
4754.0,Patient,yeah.
726.0,Provider,"Well, I was thinking about. Today, and what you would like to work on and also, I remember. I remember something about doing em Dr and how if you're an active use of alcohol or any substance it's not like it's just not a good. To do processing of that So what we could do is maybe some other work around like coping skill that we can do with installation to help to get to that point."
4754.0,Patient,Okay.
726.0,Provider,"If that works. Just because I know you're still drinking, and so the the fear with that is so much more of a concern is if we open up these memories and you start processing it's going to make you want to drink more. You know what i'm saying so it's like even if someone is in recovery usually it's six months to a year before we do any kind of processing of doing like straight processing mtr memories."
4754.0,Patient,mm hmm.
726.0,Provider,yeah. cool yeah.
4754.0,Patient,there's.
726.0,Provider,"I mean there's there's other things we can do until that point, though, that we can work on so um. One of the things that we do with the mtr is creating safe safe place it could be safe or complex, however, you want to name it and so thinking about a place that you feel comfortable you feel safe that um. Because we start processing memories, when you get triggered in between sessions it's one of those skills that you can use on your own without the therapists that will help kind of regulate your emotions of it and just help you to feel more calm. So why do I know you talked about our last session of how angry you get. Would you like to do what we did before, with the I movement, where it kind of just. Images started showing up. With with dad just kind of processing where that ankle was this comment from. The physical reactions to it."
4754.0,Patient,yeah okay.
726.0,Provider,"So, since last last time I saw you what was the most recent feeling of anger that felt close to that or was that."
4754.0,Patient,"i'm. school. um. I don't think I have many things this last week, except like. In I went to work and I came home and my dog had like chewed up random stuff. A couple of times. And so I got like mad, but I didn't like doing anything I think like I was just like what the Fuck dude. and yeah so. Nothing crazy."
726.0,Provider,All right. let's do this for. I think you were talking about the last time you got super angry was something. was my favorite. was my God yes okay. So. i'm gonna let's do a float back and the flow back is kind of targeting what's the youngest. So you can remember feeling that that intensity of anger and you said it was in your room and you were a kid I think.
4754.0,Patient,yeah I was really young and I like through everything all over the place. destroyed everything.
726.0,Provider,I know it's kind of hard i'm trying to figure out what the best course would be now. We don't district process in memory. Like if you're up for this i'm up for this once once processing memory today and I want to follow up with you within the week and see how you're doing after the processing does that make sense. yeah okay all right.
4754.0,Patient,Good handle it.
726.0,Provider,"All right, no. let's start with what's the targeted memory that you would like to work on today, I know you pass quite a few of them in your mind. yeah think of one that's not super triggering so if you're if you're thinking on a scale of all this, I can couldn't handle this or I am at that point where I kind of handle it but it's still really bothers me."
4754.0,Patient,um. I think we can. Do the. The like serving divorce papers one.
726.0,Provider,I thought I was thinking of. That one yeah.
4754.0,Patient,"Really, she wasn't like violent really."
726.0,Provider,"And without the library, she was on. working there, I think you were saying that she was."
4754.0,Patient,Volunteering there.
726.0,Provider,um okay.
4754.0,Patient,she's an angel.
726.0,Provider,"Alright, so i'm gonna share my screen because i'm going to open something up on this is the belief that so when we think of an experience what is the belief about ourselves that underlying. One second i'm going to put this on here. Miss Shannon now what's the most disturbing image of that is it walking into the library is it being in the car or is it actually handing those that that that people were to your mom."
4754.0,Patient,It was like at the exact moment where. I realized I didn't have a choice. And he was like just screaming in my face to me.
726.0,Provider,screaming in your face and where do you in the car at this point when that.
4754.0,Patient,knows my bedroom she came into my bedroom and. Let her have it.
726.0,Provider,i'm going to share my screen and i'm going to ask what words go best with that image that expresses a negative belief about yourself now salamis share this. Year yeah.
4754.0,Patient,yeah.
726.0,Provider,And negative is i'm. Trying to think i'm your your point would probably be on the last.
4754.0,Patient,So I just took notice that.
726.0,Provider,"I would pick one that feels like a resonates the most with this experience so so your target memory is not having realizing that you don't have a choice, and you are in your room at your desk screaming at you. So, so it could be, I am powerless helpless, I cannot get what I want, I cannot stand up for myself."
4754.0,Patient,I think see. powerless helpless one. For me.
726.0,Provider,"opposite of what you would like to believe about yourself after will process would what What would you choose from the other side, so. Some thinking, the positive is the opposite of what you chose. i'll make it bigger So you can see it better."
4754.0,Patient,Or maybe. I can make my millions known.
726.0,Provider,"Get rid of those here. So when you think of that that image, how to do the words I can make my need to know feel to now on a scale of one to seven, one being completely false completely true."
4754.0,Patient,um. Like. A three.
726.0,Provider,"Why don't you come up when you bring up the feeling and the imaging the word I am powerless. What emotion, do you feel now."
4754.0,Patient,um I mean I feel frustrated and. anger. and fear.
726.0,Provider,on a scale of zero to 1010 being note the serpent's notice pumper at all and 10 being the highest level of discomfort you can handle it. How disturbing distant memory field team now I thought.
4754.0,Patient,Like a two or three words.
726.0,Provider,"Would you say. Would you score it cuz if you say that the two or three it's not that much the survey, but I remember when you talked about it it's so really. It felt really. Not recent but I felt like it's still there, so, would you say, for it higher than two or three just based off of that."
4754.0,Patient,"I mean I don't know I mean like. Sometimes I feel so far removed from it like it's just like a story that I tell I think that's like in this moment I feel like that, just because I haven't like relived it, yet again, you know. Like if I like when I get into like i'm sure it will be like it will feel a lot worse, but it doesn't like like think about it every day and get upset you know when I think that it's like oh yeah That was a weird thing that."
726.0,Provider,"We talked about it, what would you have supported at that day."
4754.0,Patient,Oh. He.
726.0,Provider,"Is processing to it has to be something that feels but i'm sure i'm not concerned about this, because I know that when you're processing something would come up. When you think about that memory, where do you feel it in your body, the acre the fear the frustration, where do you feel if you were to do a body scan from the top of your head, all the way down to your toes work where does it. Okay."
4754.0,Patient,Probably. My head and. My entire torso. matrix.
726.0,Provider,"So Julia I know that we're jumping right into processes. So I just want you to. Have a little conversation with. Your Julia from a kid Okay, and just tell her that only what you're ready to remember only way you're ready to process is what's going to come up okay now we're going to keep you safe we're going to keep her safe all right."
4754.0,Patient,yeah.
726.0,Provider,"Because that's going to be really important there's no processing people really feel that safety now OK. OK so i'm going to show you different ways to do that i'm missing you tell me which one is best for you, so this is the first one. I can do this, this. or up and down. chevy choose."
4754.0,Patient,i'm like the third to certain.
726.0,Provider,"We start processing if I go too fast or too slow, with the i'm movements just let me know so I can put it to your comfort level. So you're able to process. If I go too fast or too slow, sometimes of brain process memories, so you tell me if it's too much for OK. So now, I want you to bring up the the target memory, which was you know, being in your it sounds like you were in your bedroom. Not having a choice of of what you have your dad yelling at you tell me that you had to get the papers Okay, so I just want you to go off that far, I mean that image. Let your brain go where wants to go, you do not have to control it, you don't have to manipulate your thoughts to do anything it'll just move on it's on the way it wants to okay. You might jump in different time frames, that in your life and that's totally normal okay so just follow my fingers okay. I feel like."
4754.0,Patient,i'm. Not much yeah I don't know. If I really got into that all.
726.0,Provider,Oh alright. This God can see what happens okay. i'll do it for a bit longer so that maybe that'll pop it okay.
4754.0,Patient,Was you sing about. Oh. yeah no I don't like i'm very sensitive to. Not having control anymore. or not having control because of that maybe like. I get really like. sensitive and angry about it. So that like I flipped out like he does kind of thing. I think. are just like thinking about that my heart started racing world.
726.0,Provider,"Thank you, like it's much just give me just let me know and i'll stop okay. yeah just go off that last image last impression last."
4754.0,Patient,What a psycho. What.
726.0,Provider,I didn't hear what you said.
4754.0,Patient,"Like us. Again, like what a psycho he is. No. He."
726.0,Provider,"would say to people, the nice thing about you know, Dr is if you're getting images that you're not comfortable telling to somebody you don't have to tell me everything. I just want to know that you're you're the images and the feelings are moving in a different direction, just so you so like I said, like trust your brain trust your body and knows what it's doing just let it do what it needs to do. let's go off that last one."
4754.0,Patient,What. Cuts up like after your first word.
726.0,Provider,"After. Like when you're following the fingers, are you getting images are feeling so showing up."
4754.0,Patient,"yeah. Random thoughts now like images are coming up from different places. But. Like most like. consent and like weapons like that. yeah. yeah. space, though. Or is it like in it all know awesome."
726.0,Provider,"It gets you fired and you feel like you're your brain doesn't wanna. dig even deeper and. i'm mean it's Okay, sometimes that happens, I think."
4754.0,Patient,yeah my brain is really not. letting it. yeah. I don't know why doesn't like. A sudden.
726.0,Provider,"You just think your body, because it's really just kind of protected so so maybe there's something there, maybe it's not ready yet to be something that you've acknowledged in a conscious way, it might be something so far, just so we can me, we can work with it. Even if you're not in that much you're getting to see the experience of what it's like to do processing right. So, so this is what we'll do Okay, I want you to. Imagine all of the things that have come up while you've been doing the the power of the fingers and just kind of. put it in in like boxes from now right, these are all things that we can move visit, and these are all things that we can work on separately. So just imagine like. Doing it's called a container exercise to compartmentalize these things so imagine putting everything in its own container and just kind of keeping it stored in your brain. we're, not forgetting about it we're going to come back to it, but right now we're just going to put it away for them. Alright, so. I mean. If you can do that just you could do it with yourself just imagine doing that, so that it's not out in it's not raw out in the world today."
4754.0,Patient,yeah.
726.0,Provider,"But take this thing, what did you feel about the experience at the beginning, did you feel like you were able to process some things and then it. And then it kind of stopped or was it hard, from the beginning to go into it."
4754.0,Patient,"It was hard but, but I did get I did feel like I was. Processing a little bit and then. And then it trailed off again and then. And then I was. Maybe. I was like. I was thinking about things that. are like related but I wasn't processing them. I was like thinking about them so yeah that was her."
726.0,Provider,Even though you love. You were thinking about things like you were processing that.
4754.0,Patient,you're breathing in.
726.0,Provider,"Your brain that's the way that it is processing the information so sometimes it doesn't make sense to us because we're we're the ones that are processing something but but you're freeing was processing. It was just not in the way that maybe you thought it happened, maybe. You didn't do anything wrong, by the way at all, so I don't want you to think that that you did something and it wasn't working. Okay, it could it could just be that there's a lot there it's a loaded even though you pick something that you didn't think itself that triggering maybe there's a lot more in depth with that."
4754.0,Patient,yeah. yeah. it's true. yeah. yeah. Like I never thought were really that I. Am like really. super early.
726.0,Provider,What are some of those things that were leading that you did I think we're relating the one.
4754.0,Patient,"i'm. i'm. One time I was like seeing this girl and. I was like trying to go home or when I we were just like washing their their house. And I was like tired, so I was like i'm gonna go she was like. She was like no and because she went to have sex and I was like now like, I really gotta go home and she was like no I want you know so there's like. She literally pin me down and took my pants off and she went down on me for like 10 minutes and I was just like when is tough, I want to go home. And then I went home after I just like got up when she like, finally stops because I wasn't like reacting to it, obviously. And I just was like really mean and then on my way home, I was like I was like I felt really gross and like when I when I was happening, I was like laughing I was like haha like no I was like know darn. And so it's just like bizarre. That that happened that that was my reaction was laughing and then just leaving without like another word and then. After that, and like it came up just because it's like. Is that like inability to be heard, like i'm i'm fucking saying no and and these people are listening to me. Like. Oh, my God it's happening again like where i'm just like. laughing and like not being taken seriously because it's sick i'm reacting. and Now just not being listened to, like and then like going home and be like why the Fuck I love that happened like why why why didn't I just not do it, why did they get forced to do something like this, like and that's like that. Like both of them will. feel like the state where i'm. Like. Why can they not do it, what. we're trying to do that I can't say. It the right way that like makes people listen. So, like. Actually, like a year after that happened with that girl that we're seeing. You know, and even she just goes to her, just like this fucking weird it and she like almost I almost got into it again with her like I was like i'm. gonna have to leave a message like before i'd like even like really admitted it or whatever I was, like, I believe, and she tried it again and I just like ran from her and like slam the door on her, but it was like in a joking way I was I love. again. yeah and I would call and then one time, I saw you like, a year after. i'm hanging out with another ex girlfriend and. She was like trying to get me to eat like some fucking cracker right and I like don't like it was like one of the like we're raising crackers or something and I was like no, thank you, like I don't want one, and she. And she was like no even know, I was like no I don't I don't want one. And she was like holding it up to a mouth and I was like get it trying to get away, and I was like no i'm really like not gonna eat it and she would not fucking stop like she wouldn't she wouldn't say like No, let me record. and I lost it, I was like. fucking cracker like it like totally was like the most inappropriate reaction and I fully get the Fuck out on her, I was like. Really, just like why wish i'd done the other times like actually funny matter wasn't about crackers. said no, I don't want it, I don't. Know i'm not fucking doing it and it's totally just like crazy like. Like. Talk for a while. Really fucking weird."
726.0,Provider,"Really, I heard that says this is therapy you're making the connections that you will. Maybe you weren't aware of before you know, and I know this isn't gonna change anything but you didn't let anything happen somebody just wasn't listening. And so i'm I almost wonder if the anger that you have is is due to the feeling of that of just not being heard and people listening when you're angry like people will listen when you're angry, but."
4754.0,Patient,But.
726.0,Provider,"Nice feeling like they listen to you, otherwise."
4754.0,Patient,You know. Like why don't people.
726.0,Provider,"Julia now that you have more awareness of it it'll become more easier for you to be able to make those boundaries between those healthy boundaries between you and the person that you're with. I think this will help you be aware of it, and now because maybe you didn't realize I didn't bother you as much as it does."
4754.0,Patient,yeah. yeah no.
726.0,Provider,"it's your body, you make the choice of what you want to do with it, that wasn't your fault. That wasn't your fault, at all. And I think it's a normal reaction when you feel uncomfortable people do laugh because they're uncomfortable you know. So no I mean, I know that you're probably thinking to yourself, like why the hell, did I do that but that's a normal reaction when you feel comfortable and you don't even know what to do so now that you know that you didn't know what to do at the moment. It gives you a different perspective. He didn't do anything wrong."
4754.0,Patient,"Oh no is it happened again to. Like it had like a one night stand with this guy like last. Before the epidemic I don't know time but. The next morning I was trying to leave, I can say okay i'm gonna go home. And he was like no. No, I want to go off first and I was like. I was like worried, I was like. Should I like we can see in and just like be like. You know. Like how am I going to get out of this safely. And so I just let him do it, and then I was like the same thing as. What the Fuck like Why did I do that. But. No, it. was different. At that point, I was just like whatever. But."
726.0,Provider,"there's something before we end this session is you, because I know that that. A lot came up. And this is what I do with processing you see how much came up I know you're capable, but this is just like this is what happened to take one memory. And then you start making all the links in the chain of why oh my God, this is why I did that Oh, this is why I said that. So it starts to make sense to you you're getting an understanding of what why you think and do the things that you do, because when you do something. you're just like i'm a my wife did it, for once, you do this, you start seeing the links between what happened to make that happen. Right, so this is what we'll do i'm gonna I want to follow up with you next week, even if it's just for a half hour session just see how you're doing, because this is really some heavy stuff that came up for you all right. Yes, well. What won't do now is we're ending, I just want you to focus on your body sensations I want, so that we can do this, but I don't want you to think about any of this stuff I just want you to focus on what happened in your body okay all right and we've done this before. Right so just focus, where do you feel it right now in your body."
4754.0,Patient,my chest.
726.0,Provider,"So just focus on that that temptation right here Okay, and if you're comfortable, this is helpful for some people, and maybe not for this, but just put your hand on your heart. Okay, I know, sounds weird but just go just try it just have your heart and just follow my fingers and just focus on your body okay."
4754.0,Patient,"Sorry, I."
726.0,Provider,mean anything happen in your body when you were following that.
4754.0,Patient,"Oh. yeah. queasiness. i'd started thinking about something. had to do with the day, so my heart started like. Beating again like a lot faster."
726.0,Provider,"Let me see. I want to follow up with him. Right, even if it's just checking in seeing how you're feeling and doing okay. it's gonna be like a. Our appointment, but would you be available at 11am next week on Tuesday."
4754.0,Patient,um yeah. yeah.
726.0,Provider,"Next week, on Tuesday okay. I don't know what you have going on for the rest of the day, but just trying to be gentle with yourself um you. be very aware of your environment because you might get triggered pretty easily consume process and some stuff So if you want just keep track of it, so we can talk about it because I want to see how what came up afterwards in between today and our next appointment okay. Right."
4754.0,Patient,See.
