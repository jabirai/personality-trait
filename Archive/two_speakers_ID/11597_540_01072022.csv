I would like to see if they would meet and see if there would be okay, but that's my sister's excuse, so I think that's just the reason why she wants to watch a movie.

Is want to have their little thing I said why and that's what he told me, I was like dude i'm gonna kick your ass so you don't need to cheat not hurt so busy, we had a problem with that, with his mom and me. She would cheat and he just like that so much, but now he did it, so I don't know if that was like a thing so just following his mom's footsteps or not, or what not it happened Tony it better, not do it again because next time i'm going to step in."
540.0,Provider,And how long has him in the girlfriend been together.
11597.0,Patient,"Oh, since high school he's 23 so yeah it's been some time he explained to. Five years yeah."
540.0,Provider,And how long was he cheated on her for.
11597.0,Patient,"is just a few times. It wasn't just one time, neither like it was a couple girl. But it was just like a one night stand kind of thing nothing serious trying to leave her but. I don't know I told him I say you guys just need to work out your guys problem. Is if it's heard and let her know talk to her explain to her don't step out on if you go step on on her break up with their. Then do your thing. don't do a why you whether."
540.0,Provider,"Especially that they've been together since high school so i'm sure he's what she. But yeah so I mean now he knows more but but i'm sure that, if they were able to have like that mature kind of conversation of like what's actually going on and why he felt like he needed ready."
11597.0,Patient,They need to figure out what the problem is.
540.0,Provider,"and definitely not sweep under the rug because you can get a house and have the honeymoon phase, but there's still going to be those underlying things that there has to be some type of like emptiness there potentially."
11597.0,Patient,"right but yeah that's the whole problem with me being able to stay with them okay all right, so I. I have, nobody else. So I have to try to do it all."
540.0,Provider,So when your son be willing to watch over your dog if you stayed at your sister's house to get to play.
11597.0,Patient,"That would be the whole thing other thing too is like my son was still let me do it when he has dogs to. One is aggressive normally towards other dogs. Their brothers they they were from the same letter so they're they're fine with one another, but. Bringing in other one is introduced. Then one has a problem. Okay, oh. yeah you don't yeah that would be the whole thing about that, but. He said that like if I was there wouldn't be a problem, but they don't have time to take care of. wouldn't be able to take care of my dog, along with her. Okay, with being trying to be separated and doing all that it'd be just a big hassle. Because yeah That was the other thing is, let my dog stay with my son and then me go stay with my sister yeah but that's. i've we've already laid out all the options. So it's just me trying to."
540.0,Provider,Meaning playing the wing.
11597.0,Patient,"Until I can be able to do it myself. There is a trailer park out there, that my sister was talking about this. Pretty cheap so. To check into once i'd be able to start making money or saving but."
540.0,Provider,Are you supposed to be getting any money back for tax time.
11597.0,Patient,"No, no. I mean, I might be able to through the one job that I had before I quit and started, taking care of my mom full time. But the job that I have now he pays cash we don't get 1099 we don't do anything I don't know how he works it but. We don't yeah there's no way of doing tax."
540.0,Provider,yeah it's that line of work to that you're able to have like that cash rate.
11597.0,Patient,"yeah yeah it's actually helping out too, because I mean it's kind of broadening the system, a little bit, but I get food stamps and health care state so with me beginning cash I would probably like if I was actually a payroll out make too much in."
540.0,Provider,A decent amount of money and then not having to get taxes taken out too so being able to.
11597.0,Patient,They would cut me off my food stamps and healthcare and then I would have to. figure out how to get my own health care and that $214 or whatever from food stamps would be gone. And that would.
540.0,Provider,dollars a month in itself. yeah yeah.
11597.0,Patient,"Right now, they took it away from me yeah."
540.0,Provider,No absolutely.
11597.0,Patient,"But I. The only reason why I don't mind doing it this way is because, like i've had payroll jobs, all the rest of my life younger all the way up, so I paid my taxes done all that kind of stuff so I don't feel bad about. Getting just food stamps and healthcare, for I don't get anything else from a no cash assistance know anything like that, but I paid all my taxes from the time I was actually starting to work at 14 all the way up. So yeah I don't. Think about it in a bad way because I I didn't do my taxes."
540.0,Provider,it's not like you're it's not like you're living it up in a mansion and taking right. it's it's not you some.
11597.0,Patient,People out and if see that has like four or five kids will get 12 to 1500 dollars a month or in food stamp plus as. So it's a live in large on. Some of them I. mean they're still got all but they still. they're not they don't have to worry you. know your name see ya seen all them.

540.0,Provider,"For transcription That was my individual therapy session with Derek Khan, and so I just went over a few of the topics that popped up in his surveys so God he scored a 13 which was moderating society and pH Q nine he scored a 10 which is moderate depression. So there's some things that popped up, which was sleep issues low self esteem i'm feeling nervous worried trouble relaxing restlessness. So we touched upon the sleep issues. Somewhat like the restlessness. He talked the last time we met he recently lost his mom so a lot of this has impacted him greatly. His mom was his person, so he lives in the apartment that they had together so that's just something that he's trying to cope with and he's also trying to find another place to live so. As he talked before true plan goals for him individually short term goals is to try and the next 123 months to find a place be able to save enough money and move from that i'm just because it's reminding him of his mom every single day and it's really hard on him by on. He said that the sleep issues he's dealt with that, for his whole life and insomnia. Other than I looked at his drug screens, everything is negative, except for thc and few. But other than that. Nothing else to rapport I know he said that the marijuana. helps with the anxiety, as well as when he has to get to sleep, or it does help for that. Other than that, should be it for Derek Thank you."
