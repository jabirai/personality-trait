So it's hard and not every SS ssri, which is what that is you know works, you know, for the same diagnosis for for for the you know, a person everybody's different their chemistry is always. slightly different so they're kind of dial it in, and it takes a while to really figure out what works best for people, but you got to be consistent.

724.0,Provider,yeah it's important that you have insurance. You kind of get like wrapped up and have your own personal doctor that.
15130.0,Patient,writing.
724.0,Provider,"That you see consistently like, at least at minimum like for your like your yearly checkup so that you have like like a like a like a continuity of care medical records, so you can start tracking things because you're 40 years old now correct."
15130.0,Patient,yeah i'm going to be 40 here in a couple weeks.
724.0,Provider,"Okay yeah so you're going to really want to start paying attention to like or like early warning signs stuff because, as we get older. it's destined to happen, where to start picking up illnesses and ailments. All right, you don't want to have like a like a country record, so they can kind of track things for you so it's really important to have like a primary care physician, so you get time you have the option. You know, work with your insurance company and try to get locked in to find one, and then you get least get a year yearly check out. Is there right."
15130.0,Patient,yeah absolutely.
724.0,Provider,"So, what are you taking the lexapro for."
15130.0,Patient,"Well, I never I never really I never really thought I had depression or anxiety or anything but when I was going through this on. This court that was like what i've been going through, I talked to a cold people and they're like you're kind of fidgety I sometimes I get fidgety and I move around a lot. yeah they're like you have anxiety and I was like I don't know I never thought I did so, I went to the doctor and I said yeah you probably do have some slides anxiety going on. But I think a lot of that was brought on by myself just from you know do what I was doing it myself and then i'm would always be in the back of my mind, why do I keep doing this to myself. And then you know financial things that would bring on that's what really brings on the anxiety for me, is my financial when when my bills or later."
724.0,Provider,That seems kind of. seems appropriate though right that doesn't seem like a like an abnormal thing to.
15130.0,Patient,be no. I don't think they're streaming I don't i'm not suicidal or anything like that you know I just I just get anxious about certain things and I don't think it's anything that some I don't like the new. category or anything like that.
724.0,Provider,"Okay, all right that that's fair that's fair, a lot of times you know people are like i'm anxious and as we start to unpack like the statement it's like, why are you anxious and they're like well I got fired yesterday. Okay. What else is like really that's it it's like okay well yeah I mean you should be anxious about trying to find a job and. Starting over and if you're going to get paid like you're an adult like life skills stuff like you know major life stresses financial issues relationship issues like. yeah that that does cause natural anxiety like if you didn't have any kind of feelings about it one way, the other i'd be more concerned about that lack of. Having the appropriate Felix now of course people have no real anxiety and when you see it and then you're like oh yeah like my stuff's not like that, like myself, is not there. Right like for real for real you're like okay. But naturally we all get anxious, we all get depressed based on situations. And it's just the natural human response and on the other end of the spectrum there's real depression real anxiety. that's debilitating and needs to be addressed through medical intervention, so that stuff does exist any any real diagnosis is in the past, you know other than."
15130.0,Patient,The speculum. say no.
724.0,Provider,"All right, um. Any any history of hospitalizations due to mental health concerns 51 these are I don't know what they call an Ohio like every states different but. yeah like mental health holes are cycles are so."

15130.0,Patient,"um I mean she's still she's still drinks, but um you know is. I. don't know I seen her go through her fair share of issues, you know um. You know she did the best when we were younger, I mean and that's Another thing I think about like when we were younger, it was a different time so then she had I got two sisters that are 10 years younger than me. So when they were growing up, you know, I was already in my 20s. And my mind was didn't hear them, so I watched them get certain things that me and my brother never had, as we were growing up, so I just kind of like you know my mom was a different person so she's growing up, you know, at the same time, so I kind of understand that now. Okay, but my mom's always been a strong woman she's always held the family together so. Okay, I can I don't think my mom. I can't really say anything bad about her, she does she's done pretty good herself."
724.0,Provider,um. No history of self harm self injury behavior thoughts of suicide. suicidal attempts.
15130.0,Patient,No Absolutely not.

724.0,Provider,All right. Have you experienced any like serious consequences from your from your opiate use or your alcohol use.
15130.0,Patient,"um well you know there's been certain times, where I know I could have harm somebody driving a vehicle and i'm out of my mind drive I got lucky, I guess, I could have killed myself or somebody else. Thank God that never happened. But no, the only times like from from moby us or less I thought I was eating a perfect setting it wasn't it was fun, though, I guess, and you know that for me asleep so that was the only time that I actually had a scare like that."
724.0,Provider,yeah and unfortunately that's happening more and more and more.
15130.0,Patient,comments are.
724.0,Provider,"prevalent it's. it's really bad now I had patient I said were. You know, pretty solid and you know they thought they were doing one thing got another thing and died so it's like."
15130.0,Patient,Right.
724.0,Provider,"Now the fentanyl is it, I should just tell people like us a universal precaution and just assume that everything that you touch has got fat all in it. Right, a lot of people that you know. They sell and distribute drugs it's just not one thing they're probably doing a bunch of shit and it's like. you're getting like like transfer on equipment, you know just like you working like food services for students, like if you're not washing your hands you're transferring whatever you just working on, little by little to that new thing. And you know it's microscopic it now, but eventually like over time it builds up enough to be pretty evident that you got cross contamination on so. I just felt like you gotta Be careful this assume everything is tested if you got the capability to tested for fentanyl because that was showed up in people's we showed up in their opiate screens and just everywhere it kind of became so yeah. yeah."
15130.0,Patient,"yeah and you know you know this, I live in a small town so. You know, you know you kind of know, everybody in a lot of people that I grew up with you know they passed away from using heroin and stuff so that always trying to me, I like that's that's what scares me because I don't want to die. But not trying to kill myself and you see people do that, like they they get sober get cleaning and they relapse and it kills them now as."
724.0,Provider,"Because they think they think because, with a clean time that they can go straight back into doing what they used to do they think that their tolerance is what it was when they stop. that's not true at all, you know what I mean like you're super vulnerable it's like anything else, like. Right pick pick some other like like exercise, you know what I mean so like yeah used to be able to run a mile you know and whatever was 12 minutes, but you have you ever ran a year you're definitely not going to run a mile and 12 minutes. right but we're we're stubborn and like that respect, then it opens up people's to like a lot of risk and unfortunately it always tends to me like poorly for them. what's your support network like you said you're engaged and you got a couple of kids."
15130.0,Patient,"yeah in actually on so. Well we've split up for a year and we recently got back together at the beginning of the year, and our relationship. away got pretty rough and we was at each other's throats all the time. We were both using alcohol and drugs and we split up and she took a pretty bad. um she ended up getting in trouble with the law. And it made her see some things so now she got treatment and she started doing her thing and then I had to go through and start getting treatments I got in trouble so. we're actually working on it together we go to a and you know we're looking for a church to go to. So we've been doing positive things in our relationship has gotten a lot better like I said, we were separated for a year. We have a child together so."

724.0,Provider,yeah that's super tough. i'm sorry I had to go through the sorry that everybody had to go through that.

15130.0,Patient,"steamed yet drums left, so I remember that."
724.0,Provider,"yeah so people give us like a like a rash of shit sometimes it's like hey they weren't always good but. Also in the browser pick it up one day and. You know, turn it around for a few years will say."
15130.0,Patient,"i'd be happy, just to win a playoff game this year that'd be awesome."
724.0,Provider,"didn't they play well last year, am I gonna say yeah."
15130.0,Patient,"We I mean we played Kansas city in the first round, and they beat us it was a close game, we probably should have. One or the. There was a hell, I had to had carry he led with the helmet at the end of the game and they cut they didn't call the penalty, they should have called it."
724.0,Provider,"is one of those. yeah well, maybe this year. Well that's it that's it on my end. So what I want you to do is when you meet with your group so. That the doctor should be there theoretically right on Tuesday."
15130.0,Patient,"yeah she's there she's. There and she's there like listening she chimes in and she goes through, and does all had callipers talks everybody for a second and she's just kind of sits back."
724.0,Provider,"Okay, so what I would do is when you have Center like this, she bought us or the group chat like can you send me like a private chat."
15130.0,Patient,"Yes, you can do that, yes, she does that."
724.0,Provider,"just send her a chat and be like look, I want to make an appointment with you. So you let me know sometimes the providers are like I don't make the appointments I don't do that up yourself show might referees the care enough. So this is what you're going to do. So when you sign in to the virtual clinic on Tuesday, for your group tell them that you want to make a one on one appointment with your primary. With her they'll do that so, then you just let her know be like hey we're scheduled to meet one on one, I want to talk to you about. My medication protocol, and she might be able to resolve it right, then, and you could skip the one on one or two, just like okay we'll talk during the appointment and that'll, be it so. be proactive set the appointment up first and then just give her the heads up and like I said, you might not have to do the appointment and she might. Have a game plan for you. there's always like the apprehension of getting people on the medication and off of immediately. Because they don't want to put people like into withdrawal and when people start to withdraw from opiates at something they use again. Because it just trying to maintain and not using the get high. But you don't seem like you have like the headspace where you're like oh like like oh i've been sober now, for you know, three weeks i'm ready to do this thing. So it sounds like you got environmental factors you got a lot of good stuff going for you and I don't really think that you're the type that's trying to use again to get high. So talk to them about a like a tapering protocol that's an option what's your dose that."
15130.0,Patient,"i'm writing my meds right now. Let me, let me grab it real quick. Alright it's a. It says a. 5.7 dash 1.4 milligram tablet. And I Oh, I only take half of the tablet. And then, but I take a whole tablet throughout the day. So I get one tablet day and I split it in half, so I take half in the morning happen, I."
724.0,Provider,And is it. When you take that first half what time you take that.
15130.0,Patient,"Well, sometimes I take it in the morning, if I remember, but and if not, I wait till after work take it okay."
724.0,Provider,So yeah I was going to see if you. What happens when you just say one like how half a tablet for the day like what happens to you like if you're any any withdrawal symptoms onset or anything like.
15130.0,Patient,"I don't really. I can't tell you that it makes me feel like I don't I don't know I just feel relaxed, you know I feel normal I don't feel like i'm. I definitely don't think about doing oxy that's for sure, I guess, with the cravings and stuff I just have them and having them, which is kind of. Which is a good thing for weeks I would think about it throughout the day you know what I mean."
724.0,Provider,"All right, um. yeah I would try to do, half a tablet and then see how long you can go without needing the second half of the tablet So if you say you wake up at eight whatever it is you do at eight right. Okay, take your initial half tablet and then see how well, you can go the entire day and if it's past the time that you would normally take your second one just see how long it goes before you start to feel if you feel anything. And then you know dose against to try to push it out so try to go like you know 13 hours or 14 hours or whatever it is, from the time that you took your first dose. Because that's one way that you would that that people taper down in order that they start pushing their dose out to see how long they can go and then only taking the follow up those. When they really, really start they feel like crap you know what i'm not when they initially start to feel like crap because you're going to build up some mental toughness right. So resist the urge to be like I don't want to feel like this, because some people get like that not saying that you do, but the second that people feel like the slightest discomfort that like oh I gotta take it now, you know what I mean. yeah try to try to live in that world just a little bit don't torture yourself, obviously, but just try to push out some of the mental toughness and build some you know some resiliency and then take it if you absolutely have to. Because that eventually like that's how it's going to work anyways you're ready to get. You know, a reduction in your medication until it's until it zero so it's the same concept you're just just trying to you're just trying to seek find out what your baseline is."
15130.0,Patient,"For you, because I feel like you go before I start feeling like. Like i'm having a thoughts or whatever."
724.0,Provider,"You know, having like flu like symptoms like like it will be withdrawal symptoms or flu like symptoms so restlessness fever chills hot cold flashes sweating. yeah all those things you know so once the onset of that starts to occur, you know cl ball, you could tolerate it for and then take the medication and you'll be fine so that's one way to kind of like work your own protocol. Alright, so try that. So check into the vc on Tuesday set up an appointment with her for a one on one later in the week or whenever she has the availability and then in the group chat. let her know that you schedule an appointment, this is kind of what you're thinking you want to do what her thoughts are what kind of game plan and then go from there all right. Okay, well, it sounds like a plan."
15130.0,Patient,"yeah sounds good, thank you."
724.0,Provider,"Alright, so, and when you meet with them on Tuesday set up an appointment with me tell that you need to do, eight another individual session with me later this month and they'll they'll schedule both your appointments that alright. Okay alright sounds like a plan well this could be Tony."
