11263.0,Patient,"To be honest with you, I. don't really I don't really use. I don't use drugs I smoked marijuana when I was in high school. But I stopped doing that shortly after high school. I. drink a little bit. You know. In high school and then a little bit after high school, but I was never really a heavy drinker. The reason why i'm in court, I had gotten a dui because I me and my longtime girlfriend had broken up, and I went out. To meet up with a different girl kind of get my mind off of that, and she stood me up and then it just so happened that my friends were there at the bar and they they just started buying me drinks and which is you know I don't I really don't drink or like that and. I I ended up like blacking out and deciding, I guess, to get in my car and I got pulled over right down the road from where I was at and then yeah here we are."
505.0,Provider,And here we are. And I haven't I haven't drank since then I don't have any urge to.
11263.0,Patient,"I think i've learned my lesson and I don't. Okay, just. i'd rather avoid any of that, to be honest with you."
505.0,Provider,"Okay okay so um alcohol, it sounds like you had an episode, where you drink too much, and then you drove and and that that was not normal for you. You know, to eat in high school any other drug use any obs any pain pills any crack and a mass anything."

505.0,Provider,"How many times a day. twice a day okay. yeah so it's. it's a little unusual for an adult to be on adderall, which is such a short acting medication. medications like vibe and concert long acting stimulants are usually preferred is that Ben discussed her i'm."
11263.0,Patient,"Not not, to my knowledge i've. My psychologist and I have met quite a few times and. that's the. that's the regimen he has me on and that's what i've been doing for like the last two years now, and I. can't work and it's been working good for me. yeah honest I, so I don't. I mean if if if i'll bring that I mean I can bring that up to him."
505.0,Provider,"yeah it was kind of more old school. Thinking okay um I would tell you that a judge or. Generally, the ego community would prefer to see somebody on adderall which has short acting and high potential for misuse, as well as a benzo klonopin and i'm not saying you're not taking things exactly as directed. But like that they generally in medicine, we prefer to have little town longer acting medications they're much safer like vine dance her concert That being said, i'm not prescribing those medicines, so I want to. go back to your depression, are you struggling with Depression and anxiety at this point."
11263.0,Patient,"Currently i'm not i'm i'm at a good place in my life I think and. You know I died check in with my my counselor and my. My psychologist pretty regularly probably. once a month once every two months, something like that, just to you know check in see how i'm doing we talk and and. And everything so far, things have been looking up for me. there for a while, you know after the I had gotten charged and stuff and. A whole court thing it was it was rather depressing because I did. I said I blacked out, so I didn't remember a lot of it, so it kind of kind of put me into a whole little bit and then with the breakup with my longtime girlfriend you know, it was the. right thing, but but i've i've been doing very well I got a new job, not that long ago that I like thoroughly and it's a better better work life scheduled in my previous job i'm actually getting days off.

Probably two months ago, so and I believe it's like a random thing like they draw you know randomly and then pull you up but I took the initial to start. Okay, and and I passed, obviously, because I got the job and then and because I i'm not taking anything and I shouldn't be taking and and then I also I also regularly take drug test for probation so."

Those of the controlled substances you've been on for at least two years there's no evidence of misuse, you know as far as your alcohol use. I mean it sounds like that was kind of a binge episode, it was not your normal. You know pattern. I think my one question is that you said that you were in an environment and there were friends are guys that you saw that. we're really encouraging you to attain drink collab here because he would have had this really bad breakup or these folks they spend a lot of time with Jeremiah these. People they can navigate."
11263.0,Patient,"No honestly, they were. They were more just old friends that I hadn't seen in a while and I wouldn't even call them like friends friends or just like acquaintances that I had known from school and like they're like oh hey this is Jeremiah and you know, and I. was like oh hey yeah and like I explained the situation to them, because obviously I was, I was you know visibly upset you know I had been stood up and and like you know they I think they were just trying to cheer me up and I. You know and and it was it was just one after another, and it was just way too much and too short of a period of time. And, and like I said it just led to something that shouldn't have been, and I regret it fully you know I. yeah I i'd never in the right state of mind, you know would get behind the wheel of a car, especially within. The circumstances I was right down the street from my aunt's house, I could have very easily walk to like it was literally within a few hundred feet of her house that I could have walked her house. You know and that's."

He didn't he didn't want to he didn't want me to hurt him, you know and and by he said, by the time I there was not enough time for him to like call and get someone to stop me by the time I got my car left you know so. Okay, you know, and I don't blame him, you know but it's you know, it was my choice in and inevitably but. yeah you know, unfortunately, there is there's nothing I can do about it now so."
505.0,Provider,"hey you're doing a lot about it, what i'm hearing in your story that is really encouraging is how much huge take personal responsibility.
