214.0,Provider,awesome so we'll proceed so tell me what brings you to bright hope.
13650.0,Patient,"I think i'm just at a point in my life, where I would like to address. I don't know if it's anxiety. But a lot of fear based feelings and actions that have sort of trickled into. My relationships my work life. and Also traumatic relationship experience that I never really got to speak about um so yeah it's all."
214.0,Provider,Give me one of your fears right now.
13650.0,Patient,"One of my fears i'm. Pretty concrete one is like. Losing my mom, for example. that's a pretty big one."
214.0,Provider,So can I just say something so when I hear fear because that's what I wrote down. i'm associating being scared. yeah and you said loss of mom right.

13650.0,Patient,I think i'm fear for the physical laughs laughs so as in depth.
214.0,Provider,"So grief and loss. yeah instead of fear right i'm just i'm like a word guy so if someone says i'm angry I automatically say you're not angry there's something else going on, we peel it back when we figure it out so Okay, I get that so that that's an important part of what may be. Presenting so have you went through a grief process if you chose you still don't know if you've grieved."
13650.0,Patient,"No, I haven't my mom my mom was diagnosed with cancer, when I was ending high school and she recovered and she's alive and well, now, but it was just a scary time but I was afraid of that before that I was."
214.0,Provider,"always going it's eminent it's always going to be President, why. yeah Okay, I understand that all right. Any chronic pain from car accident or work injury. No okay. Any treatment pride too bright heart for mental health."
13650.0,Patient,yeah very sporadically I would say I got to know a few therapist but i've moved around so much that I never got to do any in depth treatment.
214.0,Provider,"and What did you what was your last one, what did they diagnose you with What were they trying to work on."
13650.0,Patient,"They were trying to work on, we got to a point of addressing my relationship with my father. And how that could contribute to feelings of abandonment and fear of loss in different ways. But I was never able to work on that fully and."
214.0,Provider,Close recruiting or we chose not.
13650.0,Patient,"financially. Okay, was not able to continue with treatment and also addressing. I guess irrational thoughts which contribute to rage and. sort of erratic behavior."
214.0,Provider,You want to give me an example.
13650.0,Patient,"yeah so. I was on a plane a sink two years ago, and I saw two guys sitting in front of me, for whatever reason, I was able to imagine that they were planning something on the plane that. They had some sort of ill intention and I started sweating my heart started pounding. They didn't do anything wrong they they were just looking in their bags, and you know getting their books out and I went as far as to tell the flight attendant like. I feel uncomfortable I know this isn't rational, but can I please move, and I just felt this loss of control. And that was a big point for me just say like wow I really have an issue, because this has manifested throughout my life and, like in other ways, like at restaurants and stuff like that. we're actually actually i've left like as a kid I would ask my mom if we could leave because I would see someone, and I would just think something that's going to happen, I want to go. And yeah."
214.0,Provider,"Have you ever been diagnosed, other than what right height is diagnosed."
13650.0,Patient,"I haven't been diagnosed with bright heart at all, or you."
214.0,Provider,"know you have we have a diagnosis, but I want to know if the other mental health, the last one prior to this today say hey natalie, let me tell you what we think your diagnosis says."
13650.0,Patient,Oh no.
214.0,Provider,"Okay, so no dx okay any substance abuse issues. Any suicidal ideations. know any homicide ideations. know any cell phone. No, no, cutting. So now tell me what it was like growing up as a child in your family."
13650.0,Patient,"My parents divorced, when I was two, so I have always been closer to my mother who raised me spent a lot of time at school and after school programs, because my mom would work a couple jobs at a time, if she needed to. And she always just did everything she could for us to have a very comfortable life and that's how it was I never felt I was missing out on anything. My father was very involved, we were basically like still a family every weekend I would see him everything was great we would do holidays together. And then, when I was 13 he remarried and. kind of just fell off the face of the earth and didn't communicate anymore."
214.0,Provider,Is that when the abandonment issue started.
13650.0,Patient,"truth be told, I didn't feel it then I was so busy and consumed with high school and activities, and I was just like I mean I didn't realize that it was going to affect me down the line I felt the repercussions lately in my romantic relationships and my friendships."
214.0,Provider,"Is this, this is it going towards trust or vulnerability."
13650.0,Patient,"yeah I don't feel like I can be vulnerable with people. I don't feel in in in consequence it's like a cycle, because then I feel well nobody you know nobody's really close to me, but you can't get close to people without opening up."
214.0,Provider,"So I mean, but the awareness is there that. Actually what's happening is you put you put up the wall, but the wall has to do with how it got built when they got bill, why is you build. And now you're being reflective like Okay, so I built the wall, but I want to go on the other side, but I don't know how to get to the other side right so that's kind of what's going on, so I understand that."
13650.0,Patient,But yeah.
214.0,Provider,"So he's for all intensive purposes, it was a family said so that every weekend at 13 he got married right, you said you didn't. feel abandonment to lately right."
13650.0,Patient,"No, I really didn't it was right."
214.0,Provider,"So for for all intensive purposes, if we don't go to now we look at when we will high school. There were no presenting issues with that."
13650.0,Patient,"No, it was I mean I knew something had changed and I knew that my mom was really upset and my dad for it, but I personally was like. I didn't really I didn't have an opinion on it, I was, I was so busy truth be told that."
214.0,Provider,"Well it's a good thing you were busy honestly, because as an adult you may have. found a better way to manage this than as a preteen or teenager."
13650.0,Patient,So.
214.0,Provider,"i'm not saying it's great to have to go through, but you may be able to manage it much better now okay any siblings. Only child. Okay, parents are divorced. Do you think anyone in your home life struggled with mental illness or substance abuse."
13650.0,Patient,"i'm not in my direct Tom but I had an uncle who my mom's brother who died from drug use, before I was born her other brother my uncle had onset schizophrenia because of his drug use. My mom's other brother has mental health issues, I don't know exactly what they are, but he's not very close to the family, because of it."
214.0,Provider,So there's a family history. of mental illness. yeah okay.
13650.0,Patient,"Lately what's really, really been at the forefront of my mind, is my my mother tends to bottle up her feelings her fears and then express them very, very strongly in an unhealthy way and i've noticed that i'm not doing that, with people close to me my."
214.0,Provider,mom was talking to you about her fears.
13650.0,Patient,yeah my mom has some sort of concern.
214.0,Provider,"So we. But we realized I did that we've changed the family dynamics at that point right because you are the daughter. Right, she is the model you're not the friend she's not your girl from right, so we were kind of cross the small line there when parents started to rely on their children to have you know just listen to my voice, but it creates a bigger problem for the adult child all right. What about, and you have any addictive behaviors shopping. Video gaming staying out late. What was six seventh and eighth grade like feel."
13650.0,Patient,"Great junior high was great um I had a really close group of girlfriends that I still talk to now. We you know, we had we were together in an after school program so we would make videos take pictures together i've i've always been active was for it, so I play volleyball I was a spelling bee champ I was top of my class. Someone say."
214.0,Provider,i'm okay. But was that a conditioning of your family life.
13650.0,Patient,"I think it's a combination my. mom really pushed me but I don't have a problem with that what i'm saying, though, is sometimes when we look at you like, I used a general word like overachiever but the reality is."
214.0,Provider,"there's a reason that happened either a parent is is trusting or parent is very negative and the child feels that needs to trust this two reasons for that, like really just really good at everything which is fine, which is a good character, how we your grades."
13650.0,Patient,awesome nearly perfect always.
214.0,Provider,How about high school.
13650.0,Patient,same i'm.
214.0,Provider,Sure i'm on a friends in one activity symbol on the grades.
13650.0,Patient,"I would say I started focusing more on boys and less on friends. So I didn't really have a I also move school district so. I didn't have the same friend group, because I was now at a high school that none of them went to. On. So I was brand new and I was kind of the person that was I was friends with everyone but not really close to anyone. The closest people in my life or boyfriends I had. So."
214.0,Provider,Was those relationships healthy.
13650.0,Patient,"and high school. yeah I would say, they were they were pretty healthy, but now that I look back on it, there were things that I did. that have now been amplified that I think we're not healthy like how I express things that weren't comfortable or if I ever if I did right because a lot of the times I didn't say anything. So."
214.0,Provider,"So, no, no, like domestic violence or sexual abuse. How far did you eventually go in school or stop."
13650.0,Patient,I finished with my master's degree in 2017.
214.0,Provider,what's your master's degree in.
13650.0,Patient,International journalism.
214.0,Provider,sounds pretty awesome if he likes me.
13650.0,Patient,Someone has to do it.
214.0,Provider,sounds awesome. I.
13650.0,Patient,Really i've been living in Manhattan the last four years i'm in California now but i'm actually going to New York on Friday that's where I work. So.
214.0,Provider,"How ironic, is that. i've lived here all my life."
13650.0,Patient,I can hear it in your voice.
214.0,Provider,Most people can. So we can we can rule out learning disabilities there on.
13650.0,Patient,yeah I don't feel like i've had a problem.
214.0,Provider,We didn't go to the military.
13650.0,Patient,No.
214.0,Provider,"We have no financial well, let me ask do you have any financial legal obligations. That you're concerned about that you can turn."
13650.0,Patient,financial obligations um no i'm a freelancer source so sometimes that puts some stress on me.
214.0,Provider,"Okay, I got it all right, are you in a relationship. Where are you in a relationship."
13650.0,Patient,The last one ended in March of this year.
214.0,Provider,Any children. Who do you live with.
13650.0,Patient,My mother.
214.0,Provider,In both California and in La I mean California i'm in New York.
13650.0,Patient,"No New York, I live with a roommate."
214.0,Provider,"So i'm just looking over at a questionnaire that you, you filled out right, so it talks about some concerns and it's depressed sad mood panic anxiety attacks excessive wearing irritability and frequent anger. Then it goes on to tell me. solo."
13650.0,Patient,"Today is this a good time to share something that I think is important. From the last few years okay. i'm not this last relationship with the one prior. So summary would be that I was involved with this person who was 14 years older than me and we were in a serious relationship in California and then I moved to the east coast to pursue a Grad school and. He and I continued at a distance and basically after three years, I decided this wasn't the relationship that I wanted to be in because my life was moving towards working perhaps internationally. Just not being in this country and it ended in a very terrifying sort of. way that i'm still kind of dealing with which was stalking. there's a lot of threats, there was. You know, he started threatening that he was going to commit suicide, which I believed him for a really long time I actually ended up leaving New York, where I was living and moving to La very, very secretly to sort of. stay away from him because he lives in the same hometown is I grew up in so I couldn't be there um he likes sent me pictures of. You know, he had carved my initials into his name, and I mean i've i've really like been able to verbalize this now, but the way that it had me at the time was. I could only sleep if I like put down at least three glasses of wine at night, I was so terrified. And my mission was just to get away from this person, because I was, I was receiving upwards of 400 phone calls a day he was stalking all my friends on social media sending them messages asking where I was. The police were in a very big help because they said he has to actually threaten to harm you to do anything. He would I couldn't even block him because on my phone because he would generate a new number literally every hour. It was horrifying it was so terrifying like I actually feared for my life. And I had told, no one that he was showing signs of being a violent scary person, the last year of our relationship, because I was. So humiliated and embarrassed and I finally had shared with someone that I planned on seeing him, but I was scared and she said. If he's threatening to end his life and he doesn't care about his life, even if he you know why, would he care about yours, and that was what made me like really wake up. And you know there's been police calls and they check on him and they say he's totally fine we don't know what you're talking about because I thought. Somebody threatening suicide, the authorities have to know and anyways it's been this thing that has haunted me and I have never addressed it because I just wanted to get away from it and I finally got away from it. But I never thought about how it has affected me and why even ended up there in the first place and. I don't know, but I want to work on. So what i'm attracting and what it is, I want."
214.0,Provider,"don't be so hard on yourself, two things are important. And this is this is something I teach to a lot of people, we can always leave a situation, whether it's unsafe or uncomfortable that's not a good resolution because that thing is still there right, whatever that thing is. So you had to make certain decisions because they were beneficial and you weren't sure where this person's mind was that I get it, but the problem is it's still lingers right it's still really present so."
13650.0,Patient,The emails saying.
214.0,Provider,"that's what i'm saying so, this when when you started off with hold on for a minute fear it was started off with mom but it's way deeper than that and now what happens is you use the word amplify at least more than four times. It becomes hyper vigilant, like everything doesn't feel right, even if something is right, and then we question ourselves. Right, like the playing thing with the delusion we know it ain't right but that doesn't mean we're not feeling it. So the idea here is you really do have like an understanding now, the idea is what we're going to do to what I say deconstruct the manifestation and rebuild something new and something I don't I don't think. it's going to take long, I think we can do it in a well proper way where you can. At least stop with the impending thoughts, because those are the ones that are killing us the impending thoughts, because everything is possible. Everything is possible and if we think about it enough, then what's the sense of living, because if it's possible right it goes on, so I get that, so I do see you do drink alcohol all right."
13650.0,Patient,"very, very sparingly yeah."
214.0,Provider,"As a child, you were mistreated emotionally and verbally."
13650.0,Patient,I think so.
214.0,Provider,Is that hard for you to tell me.
13650.0,Patient,yeah because.
214.0,Provider,I get it.
13650.0,Patient,I feel bad.
214.0,Provider,You feel bad. That you were emotionally and verbally abused.
13650.0,Patient,I just don't feel right saying anything about the person that. that's fair I did everything for me.
214.0,Provider,"it's fair it's what we call family secrets, but that baggage can be pretty heavy at times. And that's why I. Do this not to not be empathetic not to validate some of the things, but I do this, so I can start to realize what I need to work on, or should just what we need to to to go forward. On no, no, no, no, no. sure. Jim Payne. So from not mistaken shauntel put ptsd so i'm presuming your discussion with her has no medication. on the table at this point right."
13650.0,Patient,"No, there was not any talk."
214.0,Provider,"When I say, what do you think."
13650.0,Patient,"No, thank you."
214.0,Provider,"Okay, so, then, then the repair is all on you right."
13650.0,Patient,Now yeah that's fine.
214.0,Provider,"i'm just being honest, I am not suggesting anything i'm just saying how you feel about it so it's okay you I respect for the way you feel i'm not I don't push i'm not a pusher. I think there's a couple of avalanches here that we have to figure out. How, not to make them avalanches right we got to get that ball to be much smaller than what it appears to you presently is I think everything appears to you pretty. Pretty huge and it should be especially this past not not this current past, but the one prior relationship probably systemically has a lot of psychological impacts in different. types and tones so how is your sleep."
13650.0,Patient,Now it's okay i'm.
214.0,Provider,Probably is okay. What is OK.
13650.0,Patient,I consistently go to bed around 11am wake up at 630 and I feel pretty rested even on the weekends.
214.0,Provider,No eating issues. No over exercising issues.
13650.0,Patient,No okay.
214.0,Provider,"So. Other than me right now, who you open up for you let the wall down who else is there."
13650.0,Patient,"um. My my youth pastor who's been like a father since seventh, eighth grade to me he pretty much knows everything. um."
214.0,Provider,But he's looking at it from a spirituality sounds right.
13650.0,Patient,yeah.
214.0,Provider,"Which is fine i'm fine with spirituality don't get me wrong i'm just i'm just trying to figure out, so we have one person was we have."
13650.0,Patient,"My my best friend raquel who actually by stayed with during that time, that I was running from this relationship. and Another friend that I have here, Joe."
214.0,Provider,"So, then, we do, we do have support group because that's more than one person will be support group. How long have you been. Transparent and interesting in this support group."
13650.0,Patient,i'd say the longest was with my youth pastor so that's been for. I mean 15 years now.
214.0,Provider,"You could before you get angry just hear the question just process, it has there been any improvement in those 15 years in that relationship for you the way you feel."
13650.0,Patient,between him and I.
214.0,Provider,"Know there's there's no feelings between you and him there's there's a some boundary and what i'm saying is you've talked to him for 15 years has anything benefited you and those 15 years, other than the comfort of empathy and understanding."
13650.0,Patient,Oh yeah definitely.
214.0,Provider,"Okay, good, so this is this is even better okay. yeah so it says here you're supposed to attend groups on Monday. Yes, but just remember in New York it's 10 o'clock seven o'clock. And you're supposed to see me twice a month."
13650.0,Patient,Okay.
214.0,Provider,"um I think the way I would ask you to look at this is we kind of have to work. Two sided meaning, we have to be President of the changes we need to make, but we need to be reflected that these changes are based on some past issues. Right it's almost like you're driving the rearview mirror in and through the windshield at the same time, like you, can't get away from the rearview mirror. Because it's kind of haunting and behind you and it's too fearful to look out the windshield because you're looking at the rear view mirror like you're in this like anomaly and you're not sure how to thrust, what do you want to gain from therapy."
13650.0,Patient,"I want to be. i'd like to be assertive I think that's a big problem like assertive with myself and my feelings, but. A lot of what is happening, for me, aside from the fear, but I think it's all related is because i'm mindful of not wanting to offend a lot of the time, what happens is I let my mind wander and I either fire off into some delusion or I end up. Outwardly, being obnoxious Lee angry over something that's so small, but i've just let it manifest and there are things that like people in everyday life would bring up and work with relationships, but I just tend to internalize them and. That I think is a really big issue i'm afraid of saying something, because I don't want to push someone away or I don't want them to be out of my life for bringing up that I don't like you know the way they cooked a meal."
214.0,Provider,But what your degree is in journalists.
13650.0,Patient,Journalism yeah.
214.0,Provider,"Your degrees in providing a communicated piece, where a blind person could understand, an event like this that's what I look at journalism, as if i'm blind and so one reason to me like yeah I could totally see how that is right. But, on one hand we have the super strength of that, but as a person outside of that what what it sounds like you're passive aggressive."
13650.0,Patient,huh.
214.0,Provider,"Yes, so why would you hurt my feelings of the meal I cook for you wasn't good."
13650.0,Patient,"that's, the last thing on my mind is it's not what I want to do that's really not."
214.0,Provider,"So, then, I can continuously making you bet food."
13650.0,Patient,that's what's happened to me.
214.0,Provider,"I know I get it and i'm not trying to make fun of it i'm just like so if we don't change the wheel we're constantly going to go around in the same patterns you're aware of it, but it's not so easy to say. And it's not funny because usually people who are communication people have a communication issue with another person versus writing something or articulating something in a story novel."
13650.0,Patient,yeah.
214.0,Provider,"But why are you why do you think you would hurt someone, why do you think that that would be hurtful, why do you why do you need to hold on to it like why don't you have a safety valve."
13650.0,Patient,This is where I feel like that was not welcome when I was growing up in my home and there was an explosive.
214.0,Provider,reaction. So wasn't do is I do do is i'm told.
13650.0,Patient,Right.
214.0,Provider,"So in in our staircase of 13 steps we've missed maybe four. And four is how do we really have empathy and respect for someone and tell them listen that that that was really the worst thing i've ever eaten or you just said something that really makes me feel feel uncomfortable. Why, why would you talk about my hair I I feel when you talk about my hair automatically I feel like there's something more than me so those statements hurt me like. i'm saying it very easily intentionally, but you haven't had those four steps to create the path to do it, so when you say, I have a lot of friends not really close a lot of friends really my close you already started to create a pattern. Of I don't want to say distance but. it's possible you more of a people pleaser the not and that now to is of shutting."
13650.0,Patient,I am. yeah okay agreeable is what the last therapist.
214.0,Provider,So how do you feel about being challenged in therapy.
13650.0,Patient,I would love that. Okay.
214.0,Provider,"I think. I think our perception of. This tastes like shit versus i'm not sure, but I find this to be bland there's a big difference between the two. I find I don't know, is it me when i'm treating it the meat seems very tough. Obviously you're acknowledging this isn't good but you're not saying tastes like sugar either like there's a way to introduce something, and if someone internalizes like you do you can't. because everybody does everybody internalizes. Like I went out of my way and I bought the meat and what do you mean it's no good you know what took me all day to make this doesn't fly the things that you gave you like see this is why I don't want to say anything cuz I rather just not deal with it. Okay, all right, I I really get it, so what days and times work best for you."
13650.0,Patient,um.
214.0,Provider,"Well, you on the are you on East coast time when."
13650.0,Patient,i'm on the east coast Friday to Friday so starting the 10th through the 17th. And then i'll be back in California time. I mean.
214.0,Provider,"You want to meet next week does next week, not work."
13650.0,Patient,"So next week, on Monday is the group class. See. You next week we'll work that's fine."
214.0,Provider,"Give me a day and time, and let me see what my schedule is like."
13650.0,Patient,How about Wednesday.
214.0,Provider,This is awesome I have 530-630-7730.
13650.0,Patient,How about 530 on Wednesday.
214.0,Provider,"Now that works alright so. So one of the things that I also do this very different than most therapists is I don't believe in long sessions. I think they're harmful, I think I only get to see you twice a month, so for 13 days you're alone. So if I start something and I don't book ended correctly, I have to leave you to yourself, I find that extremely dangerous, what I find is short sessions directing more of a focus of a pinhole. is more productive and is less harm few to wait 13 days to see me again so that's my suggestion, like I don't want to talk about 30 things and I really didn't get to accomplish anything with you because you know we just keep adding things to the list. I think we should be short and precise be very structured address, I would say addressed assertiveness see where that takes us next month say okay. This seems this seems to work if that's not something you want to do a month to do whatever you want, but I find that the results are best in fashion, especially when i'm only seeing you twice a month."
13650.0,Patient,"Twice a month for 30 minutes, then."
214.0,Provider,"I can do an hour, if you want, but I mean I already going to let you know. we're really dealing with trauma trauma is probably 85% of all we're adjusting 15% is just being able to tell somebody no."
13650.0,Patient,yeah I mean yeah.
214.0,Provider,"And and and I have to tell you i've been in all kinds of industries, this is my 10th career. i've never said no, I have a million ways to never say no, but you get the picture that that's not gonna happen. So whatever you're comfortable with it's your treatment I work with you we're partners in it it's not about what I want I always just tell you this is what I think it works it doesn't mean we have to do with that one."
13650.0,Patient,"let's do it your way and if they're made some changes, oh no."
214.0,Provider,"that's perfect, so I will see you on the 15th at 530 New York time."
13650.0,Patient,yeah that sounds good.
214.0,Provider,it's good for me so. Let me go in your chart and figure out seven o'clock seven o'clock I figured out. Any questions.
13650.0,Patient,"That was just what. shontelle I told her, I wanted to seven him."
214.0,Provider,"yeah i'm not sure that's a good group that's you know. Oh it's too, you know i'm saying."
13650.0,Patient,it's like if if I put somebody in.
214.0,Provider,"The dyslexic in and I put somebody who's a great mathematician that's not a good fit for either party that way, why is even here, so I have to review it, I think I know that i'll look at it, but i'll make some suggestions with her."
13650.0,Patient,Okay.
214.0,Provider,"yeah. Right now off the top my head i'm i'm a little. perplexed on who's in that group and what we do and I cook because we have so many of them, but i'll see you at 530 and we'll just work going forward um. So, have you done your surveys."
13650.0,Patient,"Know starting them just before, but I haven't completed any of them yet."
214.0,Provider,"Okay, because you need the BAM to get the adl annoyed but the i'd like to see the pH Q nine and i'd like to see the depression and the anxiety if i'm not mistaken they're both in double digits. But I think this situation, I would I would strongly believe that your depression is situational."
13650.0,Patient,nicely what's. what's what's sorry what's in double digits what's that based on another service.
214.0,Provider,"delivery, let me rephrase that they're not double digits. So your. Your depression score. is for."
13650.0,Patient,hmm.
214.0,Provider,It tells me there's minimal depression. But. We get to your anxiety is 14.
13650.0,Patient,mm hmm.
214.0,Provider,"that's, so this is a driving factor, and I think its environmental I don't think it's truly a condition of anxiety, I think your environment. I don't want to use the word corrupt your environment can use some improvement you're not sure how to do that career wise is that i'm not question career why we're talking about a lot of things that's why the numbers pretty high. And in when you say you know, fear and I call it impending fear because anything is possible that's that's pretty difficult to deal with and stay focus for sure. So i'm glad that you work out because i'm not sure how you happy hormones are so the work, and I was definitely going to provide you some tranquility and peace and calmness."
13650.0,Patient,"And thank you, thanks to coven before. Having more time to assess my biochemistry a little bit, so I definitely am conscious of what I eat and also like inevitably keeping track of my cycle as a female and knowing when i'm vulnerable and when i'm creative and when i'm you know that."
214.0,Provider,"You need to know your pre and post that's how, when I work with. With women it's do you know your pre and post, you know what's going to come on and what's that onset look like and is there any pre to the pre. That can minimize whether it's a heavy cycle, whether it's an emotional cycle and then what's the post look like, so all those things are very, very important so i'm a big mind body and. Mind body and soul person when i'm working with someone, and although the more data, you know about yourself, the better off you're going to be, if you don't know anything about each of. This can be quite difficult because we don't know. what's happening when it's happening why it's happening, and someone can say i've been moving and i'm like Okay, so let me look at you know. So by we're in post right we're in that time and, like oh crap I forgot and i'm like Okay, so this is why we do this so don't think it's something new just know that this basically can be you know 12 months out of the year on a specific time frame could be finding somebody."
13650.0,Patient,"that's been. that's what i've been saying, not that not that things just go away, but things heavily drastically either get worse yo things my environment can be chaotic but depending on where i'm at I can sustain my my mental."
214.0,Provider,"Life but but see. Again, when you go and you, you take time to know these things. You can minimize swing and you can start to manage better it's when something comes like a curveball and you're like. I don't even know what to do now, because anxiety has driven up really high and then to peel that back is very difficult it's easier, as it's boiling to keep it manageable versus when it gets you know panic attack like it's very difficult to come down from that. know it all all that data is very useful, you know some Mondays usually terrible for people. And I. Sometimes Thursdays, or, even worse, it just depends on who they do what they do, what their activities are everybody has a pattern, but they don't know it, but if we can start to peel it back and understanding, then we can see where we need to make these accommodations."
13650.0,Patient,huh yeah okay.
214.0,Provider,"clients. So, then, I will see you in group on Monday. And then I will see you on the 15th which is one is that right."
13650.0,Patient,"yeah is a group. What is that, like is it are we sharing."
214.0,Provider,"So he is so i'm not a fan of sharing group. And the reason for that is it's a town hall meeting so groups for me with shontelle our system is there's a theme, so we we had one that's called. It was the three c's catchy check it corrected. So that's a good one for emotion, are you are you knowing when you're vulnerable. Did someone say something to you at lunch and you didn't realize it impact, yes. So you couldn't check it so now, you can correct it in this out of control, so we go to like patterns of behavior so we can also to be like well, that would probably be helpful if I knew that or every time I see Barry. He just annoys the crap out of me, we know that's a queue So what do we do for cues, how do we get cues and control that's kind of the way that the group is structured."
13650.0,Patient,huh.
214.0,Provider,"it's not a typical like you know I had a shitty day and what somebody's got for me because before you know the service has no control and have no idea what people are telling people to do, and it can become pretty dangerous."
13650.0,Patient,yeah yeah that makes sense okay.
214.0,Provider,"So it's it's it's structured it's flexible, but its structure, but the intent is that there's a topic there's a theme, and then we get to see. All the similarities of the team because that's what I call it with the team, and then the team says, you know, I have a guy to I hate his name is Johnny and I can't stand them, but this is what I do, and then you like. i'm going to try that because I think that'll work and before you know it, the share is there, but it's based on one condition right, this is an overall outline everybody stays within that timeframe or framework and they do well that's how we run."
13650.0,Patient,Okay nice okay.
214.0,Provider,"um second thing is, if you need me for anything i'm not sure you'll ever be in crisis, or you might. You call the virtual clinic up they get in touch with me right away, plus i'm on i'm already on the crisis team, so you could always be like. You know what I think I need to talk to somebody and it doesn't mean you're in crisis, it just means at that point you're vulnerable and it's a good time to explore live is going on, if you if you feel the need you do it, if not that's fine i'll wait to see you till next week."
13650.0,Patient,"Okay, great."
214.0,Provider,"I will thank you so much, have a safe flight and i'll see you next week."
13650.0,Patient,"Alright, thanks man."
214.0,Provider,You gotta go bye.
