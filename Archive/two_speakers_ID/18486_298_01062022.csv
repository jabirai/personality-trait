298.0,Provider,hi Jesse.
18486.0,Patient,How you doing.
298.0,Provider,I have more time for you today.
18486.0,Patient,So it's okay.
298.0,Provider,"and tell me where you're at in the process, what you understand where your questions are."
18486.0,Patient,i'm i'm wondering so i'm trying to slow down on the drugs that i'm using so I can switch over to just this beautiful medicine. When do you think I could completely stop and just start and just down the pupae.
298.0,Provider,"Okay, so some people can do it in one week like they can they can go day one day two and now all of a sudden within one week, they are on it. I have other people who struggle do it in like to most people, it seems like do it in two weeks, like they can totally get themselves off of the drugs and be completely on in two weeks. Did you see because I emailed it, it turned out that I wasn't an accurate email, did you see that schedule, I gave you."
18486.0,Patient,I believe so.
298.0,Provider,"Okay, this."
18486.0,Patient,Is the first three days.
298.0,Provider,"And let me look to see. i'm going to have to look at it myself to remember when it was so. What are you on right now how much drugs, how much."
18486.0,Patient,"Right now i'm taking them to today, I took two full tablets. Okay i'm of the view. And today's I think day four. And before that I followed day 123 with a quarter tablets, just as the paper said to do and then after that. I was doing was just to a day. And then I have slowed down on the drugs that I was using I was wondering. If i'm. I was wondering if I should just go until I feel like i'm sick before I try anything."
298.0,Provider,"you're on day for now, and so we can start to increase. and increase the boob and i'm. Sorry i'm trying to pull up the the micro dosing. and Give me just a second, we can start to increase. And so they will give me just a second and reading day four to six days four to six. On day four it's four milligrams. And so day, do you see where it says Dave four to six."
18486.0,Patient,yeah.
298.0,Provider,"yeah you don't see that okay. So, tomorrow."
18486.0,Patient,"right here, this is day four day five spacex they're just not marked that's what the issue is."
298.0,Provider,"So day. Of the four so day five tomorrow will be one and a half tablets. twice a day. Okay, and then um day six would be to tablets in the morning and two tablets, and you would be up to. I know you look at it, as four milligrams so yeah two tablets twice a day on day six and then on day seven would be 12 milligrams which I gave you enough tablets, so that you could do the math and getting to you know take enough take six tablets on the Sixth day."
18486.0,Patient,Six tablets on us to twice a day.
298.0,Provider,"Well, so the very last one, where it says dissolve 12 milligrams in the morning."
18486.0,Patient,Okay.
298.0,Provider,"And that's where. I want to know if you were able to get to the 12 milligrams now what I want to do is give you my phone number, so that I know because now you're good it's going to get a little bit harder because come that six day it's when you completely stop the drugs that you would be using."
18486.0,Patient,Okay.
298.0,Provider,So your desire decreases as you go as you go each day you just feel like having less than less that's what patients tell me. and hopefully by day six you don't you don't even have the desire anymore.
18486.0,Patient,Okay.
298.0,Provider,But if something should happen let's say your day six comes and day seven comes and you're just like I I still am craving then what's going to happen is i'm going to switch you over to eight milligrams and we're going to jump up to 16 milligrams. And we'll go we'll cross over to the films at that point.
18486.0,Patient,Okay.
298.0,Provider,"Okay, so here's my phone number 541. To 541485 541-254-1485 good job i'm really proud of you that you've gotten today for how's it been so far."
18486.0,Patient,it's been okay I haven't had any like bad side effects or nothing like that i'm mainly was just wondering. When I could stop using the other stuff that i'm using and just straight stay on this was my main concern. My main question you.
298.0,Provider,So much hope day six is your day that in one four days you will be done lately with it. i'm gonna go ahead and put in what how many tablets do you have left.
18486.0,Patient,I don't know somewhere around 10 to 15. Maybe more.
298.0,Provider,Okay. i'm trying to do the math here real quick to see if you have enough to get you through these days. I can see that would be.
18486.0,Patient,Somewhat right now.
298.0,Provider,"plus six is you need 16 tablets to get you through day six. Do you think you have 16 tablets, or shall I give you some more tablets."
18486.0,Patient,"I think I need more, just in case I might. know but just just so I know I have enough. Okay we'll get more."
298.0,Provider,"You know, absolutely so i'm going it's going to save three tablets twice a day but that's only so that I could get you enough tablets okay and. So I want you to follow the piece of paper, not what it says on the bottle gotcha."
18486.0,Patient,"Yes, she explained that to me too."
298.0,Provider,"Oh good Okay, and when you get to day seven that's when I want to do the crossover."
18486.0,Patient,If.
298.0,Provider,"If you if you tell me that you were able to do that, then then we're going to cross over okay."
18486.0,Patient,Okay. You understand what she means when she says crossover. crossover like stopping just uses okay all right that's what she's okay.
298.0,Provider,"I just wanted to be here, yes that's what I need that's me we're going to completely crossover to buprenorphine product."
18486.0,Patient,Okay.
298.0,Provider,But if it don't don't get discouraged on yourself if it can be a process for some people okay so don't get discouraged just hang in there. Okay anything else that I can help you understand or anything.
18486.0,Patient,"um. I haven't been able to get. heroin in the last three or four days, and so I had to switch over to fat loss I don't know if that's any difference, but i'm doing less, I guess, because I know it's stronger but it's it keeps me from getting sick."
298.0,Provider,"Okay, so that can make it a little more challenging i'm not sure if we talked before about how fentanyl gets into the fat. And it leaks out over four days it might make it a little more challenging but it doesn't mean it can't be done okay so don't don't fret on that it just see it'll just be a little bit more challenging and hopefully every day you're using less than less."
18486.0,Patient,Okay.
298.0,Provider,"Okay, if you don't have any other questions you're good to go."
18486.0,Patient,"No, no, so day seven is the day that I should completely stop what i'm doing and I should be just on the beach. Yes, okay. that's perfect that's pretty much what I want to know Okay, you know which team you're on now. Is there any is there any way to make it to make it go easier to transition should I. Basically, tried to stop what i'm doing before. before that date is yellow I don't want you to get sick I don't want you to get sick, if you want to cut down, but if you start to get sick."
298.0,Provider,Then that's that's defeating the purpose of micro dosing.
18486.0,Patient,This.
298.0,Provider,"Is you get. yeah so it's, not that I want you to cut down to the point of stopping."
18486.0,Patient,Okay.
298.0,Provider,"All right, Jesse."
18486.0,Patient,"Allowing him. you're calling it another prescription and that will be ready, probably you're calling it I know are."
298.0,Provider,doing whatever it's already sent I sent over 15 tablets just to make sure that he he has it. i'll be waiting for your call or your text somewhere around day 67 so that I can admit cross you over completely okay.
18486.0,Patient,Are you making another appointment with him.
298.0,Provider,"know I all I need to do as so what's going to happen in the future is. Do you know when you're the whoever referred to you, do you know when your harm reduction, time is."
18486.0,Patient,"So, so we kind of have a problem with that challenge, all because the only thing that we've had has been shot, who has it was only there Thursday for three hours so it's hard to squeeze it all in."
298.0,Provider,"Okay, so and because he saw me he can stay with me, you can either have a time slot which is just a walk in basis Mondays 123 or Thursdays 11 to one."
18486.0,Patient,Can you repeat that Monday is 123 and Wednesdays.
298.0,Provider,And Thursdays.
18486.0,Patient,11 111 to one. And I was.
298.0,Provider,sitting in my room.
18486.0,Patient,"Okay, all right yeah we were concerned that it was quite difficult to make an appointment, or what you know, I was trying to make that appointment, so good."
298.0,Provider,"yeah normally people don't make appointments with me they just come to one of those and and at any point let's say um. What is today, Wednesday let's say tomorrow you showed up that would be okay or let's say next Monday, you show them that would be okay to."
18486.0,Patient,Okay okay.
298.0,Provider,Can I ask you a question that has nothing to do with jess. sure if that's okay with jess.
18486.0,Patient,"that's fine okay um so i've got a couple of more i've got two more guys that i'm enrolling tomorrow. And one of the things that's really difficult and my employees saved the day by giving just a pill cutter that he had gotten from the va for free and he said oh he'll give it to us. But cutting those pills they're so small, if we don't, are you willing to do the films, because that was kind of a it's really threw me for a loop."
298.0,Provider,"And so. This is it, this is an interesting thing because. Normally I do micro dosing through a pharmacy that cuts the bills myself themselves that produces it is there any chance that you could find a pharmacy that would do that for you guys."
18486.0,Patient,"Well, so bright our health did a big investigation and the pharmacy that just is using I thought the word that you used and I may have gotten that all wrong because I was new to that was blister packing. I think you asked me one time blister packing and so these two pharmacies, the North, like pharmacies, they will do blister packing."
298.0,Provider,"yay so how how that works is it takes a phone call from me to the pharmacy and. What I can do is I can ask bright heart health to reach out. For me. and make sure that they know our protocol and and then, since you can't order it on the computer, I have to call them on the phone like I do in San. Francisco so that would be by far the cleanest and easiest way if you're going to do more, micro dosing. And that was sent to him to North lake."
18486.0,Patient,"Even though it's, on the other side of the lake and i'm gonna go get it tomorrow for him, but that's why I was using because I knew that he was seeing you so I thought North lake blister packing okay we're out of the woods."
298.0,Provider,"Okay, but then, then the maybe the problem is with me that I did not know that I was supposed to call in if that agreement already exists with that company and they already know about blister packing I mean they already know about the protocol, the it'll make it easier."
18486.0,Patient,"I, we had a meeting with a lady named Dr was her name when."
298.0,Provider,"Yes, she is our pharmacist, what did you learn put me in the loop here."
18486.0,Patient,"Elvis is not really my field of. expertise, but she was the one who reached she's the one who called all the pharmacies and found out that North the north lake pharmacies are willing to do blister packing."
298.0,Provider,"So how it works on your side is heavy on me. Okay, well, we don't need Mr packing right now, because he's actually using tablets. But in the future for future patients. I know what to do. I will call the pharmacy myself. right if and."
18486.0,Patient,"When. Mike resonates with you, then we do with sheriff because she's only I don't know I wrote it down somewhere like three hours on Thursday."
298.0,Provider,"yeah well i'm what i'm i'm not much more than that, I mean i'm twice a day, but I am day time which does some people who are clinics and i've started to mix like hoopla and. You know, San Francisco so that there's more time because it's hard for a certain population to get access I get that."
18486.0,Patient,"Okay, well, thank you for working with us, is there anything else you want to ask her, so now we know we just when you're getting close to that we hop into the the iPad thing will you talk to me I tell you oh and look let's go that day, and then we just meet up somewhere."
298.0,Provider,So.
18486.0,Patient,"When you want to call it, you. And when is the next appointment is what i'm wondering. Well she's out making appointments yeah."
298.0,Provider,"i'm so i'm not making appointments, but when i'm doing micro dosing I give out my phone number and help you through the process to get you over that um so. The next time I hear from you. Is that you reach day seven and then I will tell you. You know, make sure you see me also but also put in a script for you."
18486.0,Patient,"Okay, so do you want me to call you on day seven."
298.0,Provider,"yeah and let me know because I need to know that you were able to get on and then I will put in another prescription for you. Okay, so what is day seven for you let's say seven. When what day. Will that be."
18486.0,Patient,case for. today's for so Friday or Saturday.
