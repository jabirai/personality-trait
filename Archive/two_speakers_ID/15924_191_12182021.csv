15924.0,Patient,"Blood type i've always been wondering, does it say that."
191.0,Provider,"don't and you know something you have to request that and I know a lot of people always curious about it. And the only time they readily give you your blood type is, if you need blood or if you donate so the way I found out, I went to the Red Cross, because they had a blow it dry and I donate it and guess what they give you all this stuff for free."
15924.0,Patient,Well Kentucky needs blood right now so maybe.
191.0,Provider,"yeah cuz I mean if you go in and say, I want to know what blood type usually what i'm told as well, we need to know a reason we have to link that to diagnose because insurance comes paying for. But when I went to give blood that's how I found out what my was, and you know when your children are born, I know, part of the newborn panel they told us, one of my children's blood type another so yeah. So negative HIV. Okay, were you on your period or coming off your period when you gave your urine."
15924.0,Patient,"I think, so I think my. Periods I write the word."
191.0,Provider,"Okay, Dan. katie and so and that's what. yeah coming off period. Before collection yeah and that's why it's showing the blood in the urine and etc, and a white blood cells and so you're not going to get a reliable result at that time okay right. Okay. All right, yeah. i'm. So are your smoker. Yes, Okay, so I do see that your and the other thing is how long have you been doing a prenatal have you been doing a prenatal gummy for a long time."
15924.0,Patient,No it's it's honestly been resent.
191.0,Provider,"Okay, Dan all right yeah, so I do want to get your. cell counts recheck Now for my smokers will see the elevator what red cell count Okay, so I don't know the reason the highest anytime you are both point one oh. But you're 5.10 and i've noticed some with some of my smokers their cell counts, can be a little bit higher because the body tries to compensate. and produce more red blood cells, because the smoking can interfere with like you know getting the oxygen that you need in some way of putting it Okay, so I want you to get a primary care to check your CBC with diff again. All right, your neutrophils account was slightly higher now if you have a tooth infection. Things like that it'll go up and it'll come back down, I always tell my patients Okay, are you having any fever anything before you check the blue now. When you go to a lab they don't usually ask that, but when you go to your primary care doctor to kind of ask you some questions so let's say if I have a person who has a tooth infection. And I draw the blood then guess what i'll see some things elevated if they have a bad cold or sinus infection, I may see some abnormal readings to. And then, when they come back you're fine and let's say we check it later goes back so these numbers can go up and down, based on what you're dealing with in your body so, but we want to make certain that it comes back down to normal so that's why I want you to check it again okay. Okay, to get your CBC checked. uds was. Negative for drugs i'm not seeing any less i'm going through like three pages yeah I don't see any drugs, so you were drinking alcohol, but no other drugs Is that correct. Correct yeah negative fentanyl honestly any fentanyl in your system. yeah yeah so so yeah so nothing that was supposed to be there. Okay. Your kidney function looks good."

191.0,Provider,"But you know something everyone is so different you know, like some people can eat something honestly, they say they can pack on like 10 pounds overnight. and other people can eat the same thing and never gain weight and so there's a lot of variables so yeah so do the process, it looks like you were protected OK. OK OK so normal uds normal cmt and liver, kidney function. Okay. Okay, patient to have CBC with diff rechecked. Smoking cessation advice Okay, so I do want you to stop that because i've had people when they stopped smoking certain things have a tendency to get better okay. But I do want you to have. Patient here CDC would def rechecked. With our PCP right we discuss Okay, discussed the zoom on 12 at tool to one and I knew we would not go have enough time in this appointment all right. Let me ask you this i'm going to give you a homework assignment and, at the end of group if we need to sit down and talk about in more detail because I don't like to rush things, but unfortunately. We only have a 15 minute appointment, I want you to think about medications for alcohol use okay. Okay, so homework a camper sake. Okay that's one medication okay acm PR oh sh T okay.

And I will plan to get you in as quickly as I can okay so out abuse is a deterrent you take the attributes you drink anything to have alcohol even certain condom is your turn read as a big get really sick okay flood. yeah okay that's that a camper say. hey people say it really helps them with cravings it doesn't make you sick people i've had people tolerate it really will and it's appealed it to take three times a day. Your kidney function looks good so we know that you can tolerate that i've had people have some knowledge on it. starting out and I usually start low and go slow now tracks on his appeal that you take it's more people on that it'd be like 50 milligrams daily okay it's an opiate Blocker So if you did end up with some serious pain. You know, we would you know we would you could still do like the tylenol ibuprofen it's the opioids that you'd have to be concerned with some people can't take it. It makes them nauseous or it makes them sick but there's a pro and a con for both the a campsite out abuse and now tracks on. Really there's there is more research at there's more data from from what i've read on the tracks on, but I want you to look at those three. And a lot of times I like to give homework assignment to my patients, and I know you're involved you like you like, to be on top of things. And so you look at it, and then you and i'll pull up the information and we'll think about what's the pros and cons which one do we want to start when do we want to start it and we'll move that forward so I do want to touch base with you next week okay.
