759.0,Provider,"Okay, good good okay all right, besides dad how you been."
15762.0,Patient,"Good I feel like we haven't talked for a few weeks, so a lot a lot happened, I did some traveling. I first spent a week in Aruba with my sisters That was really fun. And then I spent the Christmas. With my boyfriend in Colorado is his family, so I just got back from that yes, late yesterday."
759.0,Provider,Oh wow yeah so you'd have to do quite a lot of traveling yeah he hear me okay.
15762.0,Patient,yeah I can hear you.
759.0,Provider,"Okay, good. Okay, so you just traveling you saw your brother. And how was your Christmas overall."
15762.0,Patient,"Christmas overall. I feel like it was better. Meeting like being around. All of my boyfriend's family members, this time around. compared to last time. Last time. I was. there. During his birthday. So we. went to Colorado and. That was the first time I met his family and I felt like. I was just. very nervous and had a lot of. anxiety around that. And like. every night I remember not being able to sleep. I would just be wide awake."
759.0,Provider,Until.
15762.0,Patient,"Probably 3am just really anxious. And replaying what. happened the day. during the day. On the interactions with his family. Members and going over what I said to them. And like just. Really self conscious. And like there were some. interactions that. made me. feel bad about myself so like there was a lot of anxiety around. The first time meeting his family, no like this. This time around. I didn't have as much insomnia, it was just. I think one night that I had that. and That was the night we spent. One on one time with. His family like his parents had dinner with his. Parents it was just me and. And the parents. And overall dinner one well, but I was just kind of. replaying what happened and what I said whether or not like, I felt like. Everything went well. So those the only time that I had. insomnia, and I mean, I still feel like. I feel very out of place. Being in Colorado and and. We were staying at his big older brother's house. They just bought a really nice house and it's really decked out and we're sitting in the guest bedroom so I just felt a little bit like fish out of water, like, I felt out of place. But I guess that's normal and I have to get used to that. But yeah I feel like this time around, and wasn't as bad as last time but it's just still getting used to, because I feel like the way I grew up my upbringing, is very different than his. So, like during Christmas they had like a really big. gift opening moment, like everyone had President, everyone has like probably six or more presidents to unwrap and. I wasn't even expecting them to get me gifts either so like it was it was a lot of fun. But, just like the contrast of my childhood and my Christmas like. My family we. We don't really celebrate Christmas and I just don't remember every time my parents got me present we always will we're from i'm from a low income family. So we always have they applied for this government program that sent us a box, full of presence, so we never got Presidents directly from my parents, but like from a program so it was a. Very different experience. yeah so I didn't know. A few of his family members did ask me like about how normally my family celebrates Christmas, so I felt kind of uneasy talking about it and I just kind of said Oh, we don't normally celebrate Christmas as a family. it's just I don't know it just made me kind of see. That my childhood and the way I grew up maybe in was. Not as wonderful as other people. yeah."
759.0,Provider,"In comparison yeah you know just noticing the fact that. He grew up pretty much different from you in terms of how they how you would celebrate Christmas and your family versus how he was celebrate Christmas your boyfriend family was celebrating Christmas. And and coming from like a low income family, it seems as though it was hard you know, to get that kind of you know, like to have a regular Christmas, when your parents gave you gifts, you know, but you did have guesses by was from a program so so it's different from how you grew up."
15762.0,Patient,"yeah. And I don't know I guess it's not too big, of a deal, but it just made me think about that more yeah yeah and I was gonna say. I mean during the whole trip like to Aruba and to Colorado I still feel like I have trouble with eye contact I guess. I don't know it's always been. A problem with me, ever since like my depression like I just can't make eye contact like you're weird when I talked to the family and even people at the cash register I just feel I don't know I just feel weird having eye contact, so I generally just don't."
759.0,Provider,yeah so it's hard to have eye contact with you know even in social situations or just clean up to the cashier it's still hard to have that contact eye contact.
15762.0,Patient,"yeah and like an Aruba we we went to a grocery store and that was. The most anxiety provoking place that I was in. I guess that's always going to be a thing with me. But I was gonna say. So it was a good time spending the trip with my two sisters. When I remember. When we caught up like catching up with each other, we. saw a lot of a conversation. circles around my mother our mother and how. Like through her parenting style. Like all these things she did like I told us some stories about when she was very neglectful. And they also shared stories of one she neglected bellman. And I was just like I opening like wow are. Actually, our mother wasn't probably the best mother, there could have been. yeah yeah."
759.0,Provider,"Sorry go ahead, no go ahead."
15762.0,Patient,"Like I told my sisters, the time when my mom's is left me in the casinos are casinos arcade like four hours, when she went to play at the casino and then she got in trouble because. The people that work there just saw me woman roaming around and around the casino without a parent or anything so when they found her. They kind of escorted us out of the casino and kind of bander so like thinking back, I feel like yeah that's pretty serious like she has a pretty serious problem and that. She didn't think that there was a problem with that just leaving your child out like that. Shared stories with my sisters like that and that night I had some trouble sleeping because it kind of was triggering to have that conversation with my sisters. Think that's mostly what happened during my traveling."
759.0,Provider,"mm hmm well gave them to you, you know that revelations that you have with your sister, you know it's very impactful you know know the scene that she grew up with the same similar feeling about your mother right."
15762.0,Patient,Right.
759.0,Provider,yeah so I was.
15762.0,Patient,The only one going through it.
759.0,Provider,mm hmm yeah yeah so you're close with fury are you do you consider yourself close with your your siblings.
15762.0,Patient,"Yes, i'm pretty close with my sibling. My two sisters and my brother. We get along pretty well. yeah that's like our only way to cope with growing up in a dysfunctional family we've kind of banded together and made jokes about our parents and our family stuff like that."
759.0,Provider,Right yeah so having your support means probably means a lot.
15762.0,Patient,yeah.
759.0,Provider,yeah.
15762.0,Patient,it's really good to see them.
759.0,Provider,mm hmm well i'm glad that you took the time to go see them were you able to kind of like relax a little bit over the break or over your travels like like.
15762.0,Patient,"Like. Definitely definitely took my mind off all. That was really good I feel like I haven't really. spent much time focusing on myself and like enjoying like the present moment, though, having these trips and. Not being about constantly was like oh really I felt that I finally had a little break away from thinking about all those things."
759.0,Provider,Good good. How about in terms of your eggs and have you had any more nightmares.
15762.0,Patient,"No, I haven't had any nightmares so far. But I still get random Well, this is about the Supervisor, like the reason."
759.0,Provider,yeah.
15762.0,Patient,I still get random flashbacks about him more like if I see an older gentleman that kind of looked like him like.
759.0,Provider,It just.
15762.0,Patient,"triggers me, and I think that's also kind of why I was acting a bit feeling a little uneasy and awkward around my boyfriend dad to like I felt. Like just. Really scared to interact with older men now like i'm just. Very careful and cautious and make sure that i'm not you know sending any words signals or misunderstanding. But yeah. I don't know. How to get over that like I just literally just flashback."
759.0,Provider,yeah so you just rambling get flashbacks right.
15762.0,Patient,"yeah. It could just be like i'm just walking around at the airport and then they suddenly think about what happened. I think my fear is kind of growing on. me thinking that Oh, what if they don't, believe me, what if they take his side, what if he tries to change the story around."
759.0,Provider,that's.
15762.0,Patient,Just what i'm fearful about.
759.0,Provider,"Well, all you could do is just you know report what you get what I mean what happened not what you did what happened. You know, and hopefully there they can see your side of things, and when you're coming from and how sensitive of a topic that is no and in terms of him. giving you a wanted to attention by touching you and how did that make you feel uncomfortable So hopefully they be able to see your side of the story, you know, like i've just been feeling uncomfortable with him around are being in the same environment that he said."
15762.0,Patient,"yeah I just have to keep reminding myself that what he did was wrong sometimes. I question I like was I just overreacting but then like remind myself that no that's not okay and. In any situation, what he. I get a lot of passing to do with myself dope also."
759.0,Provider,"yeah. yeah. Has any the Aspen going on, like I know the flashbacks can be troublesome you know, and you feel you know, like you're being placed back into a situation where he didn't have. Control over what was happening, you know, are you put in situations or just thinking about situations where people were vital violating yo you know so in terms of that you know flashbacks. Definitely a symptom of you know, post traumatic stress disorder, you know what usually helps you get through those flashbacks."
15762.0,Patient,"I think when I get the flashback I just. let it happen, let let it passed by and then I kind of just dismiss it I don't know if that's like a good coping mechanism or not, but that's what i've been doing."
759.0,Provider,And that seems to help. That.
15762.0,Patient,"Yes, things to how I normally don't have like a panic attack or anything up for the flashbacks. Just a bit disturbing and. You know I just brings back all those emotions and they're not a good feeling."
759.0,Provider,"Good feeling about what happened yeah yeah. Well, hopefully we can process Marjorie what happened, so you know you, you have the flashbacks won't be as frequently. And that's you know in working doing what you're doing right now with therapy and journaling and doing things that can really help you with you know the flashbacks you know just kind of like sometimes you might have. A residual effect of you know, the trauma itself, but sometimes you might feel hyper vigilant, or have flashbacks you know, and those are all signs of. You know, significant trauma in your background so being able to work through that is the best best way to kind of be able to deal with that on a daily basis."
15762.0,Patient,yeah I I do notice i'm still very hyper vigilant. And I don't know I feel like people. Get that sense of intensity and me when when i'm around them.
759.0,Provider,That.
15762.0,Patient,I can't help it I feel bad that they feel intimidated or kind of like. taken aback by it.
759.0,Provider,"mm hmm. yeah. So it's kind of like he give you know I still like your energy. it's affected, you know by the intensity of the flashbacks or the hyper vigilance. yeah and you know, I think that that might be kind of like. Just the way that you are, you know, in terms of how you're feeling at that moment you can't help but feel kind of intense because. Of what you're going through, and I think that's Okay, just to say like i'm having a little intense moment, right now, our cancer. me now have tension within my body, and you know, sometimes people can pick up on that, but but also you know just realizing that you're going through it and that's okay to go through what you're going through. So, are you did you finish with finals."
15762.0,Patient,"I did I finished final and. I finally. Get that that really big maker curriculum exam know i'm really, really that that's out of the way and. Then huge lift off my shoulders."
759.0,Provider,So good good.
15762.0,Patient,yeah and then I start school again next Monday. And then we do the whole process again.
759.0,Provider,Just do the whole process again yeah school How much longer do you have.
15762.0,Patient,I have two more here.
759.0,Provider,To my year so it's gonna be here for a while wi fi being in school so yeah just being able to get gifts to the program and doing what you need to get done but i'm sure you are reuse are used to doing that.
15762.0,Patient,"yeah I feel like i'm getting used to the program now I feel like I. wasn't used to being a student initially from working to being back as a students and now I feel like i'm an actual native myself, I know how to study for thing. it's just unfortunate that there's not much of like. A campus or dude in Community right now, because it's cold so it's only when I have one class on campus that I get to actually interact with like my peers or Professor."
759.0,Provider,yeah.
15762.0,Patient,And they're like really strict about all the covert protocols and wearing masks and it's just. very tedious.
759.0,Provider,yeah yeah sounds tedious.
15762.0,Patient,"Oh yeah actually my some of like my boyfriend's family members tested positive for coven and First it was his sister in law and his brother and we were staying at their house. We had immediately move to like a hotel but we've been taking the at home test check so we've been testing negative so that's good, but then we hung out with his mom and dad and his mom tested positive. So we're just kind of like oh no are being exposed to multiple people that. have it. So we've just been very hyper vigilant about taking the at home tab like right before we flew back to La. But it kind of made the whole coven and on a cron more. Serious in my mind in his mind yeah. That like you know this is easily spreadable and even though we're not infected and we're it's just it's a scary thing and then makes me think more about like. The health aspect of it."
759.0,Provider,"uh huh. yeah you know that is something to definitely be worried about this is, you know very present and it's happening right now, you know in front of our eyes, you know people being hospitalized because of you know, the the virus in itself and. And it's a scary time you know, like in terms of do you are you going to test positive for Clovis during new you're not on recon and you know, like it's hard. But it sounds like you guys did what do you need to do in order to be saved by doing out home testing corn, you know corn keep yourself, you know way from you know you're on his brother and the parents and it sounds like you're doing what you need to get done in order to be safe. yeah just like."
15762.0,Patient,being very cautious about it.
759.0,Provider,mm hmm. yeah.
15762.0,Patient,"Definitely, then, like my biggest trip sense coven. Like just traveling and like even traveling internationally and coming back to the US like they were really strict about getting your coven tests and. So yeah it's been like very front and Center like in my mind."
759.0,Provider,yeah yeah well keep on doing the home test and doing what you can right.
15762.0,Patient,yeah.
759.0,Provider,"yeah that's the best you can do. yeah. What else should we talk about today, do you want to talk a little bit more about things that are happening right now, and you want to go back into the past to the bed, how you feel about us to talk about today."
15762.0,Patient,Where I want to talk about I feel like. You like I kind of went over what happened during the trip.
759.0,Provider,And everything.
15762.0,Patient,But I do feel like with the the medication has. been helping me. Like. I do not worry about too much what other people think or their reaction to me and just being myself.
759.0,Provider,Okay being so self. Conscious yeah so that's how.
15762.0,Patient,"yeah that's helping. But yeah. I don't know like with my ADHD I feel like. it's always been a problem, like there were instances. Where i'm not paying attention steadily as hard as I try and then I know people ask me, are you paying attention and I totally missed the whole conversation, and they get mad at me. Like I can't help it i'm sorry."
759.0,Provider,Right.
15762.0,Patient,"yeah so I don't know what I want to talk about today, other than that."
759.0,Provider,"Well, what we can do is you know, like. Cable just for next this discussion, since you know you're not in a home so maybe you might feel more comfortable being at home and talking about different issues so well, we can do is just schedule you for your next appointment how's that sound. Okay okay Okay, unless you have anything else you want to talk about today."
15762.0,Patient,"know, I think that was. Mostly, yet that was bothering me like. The flashbacks with my mom i'm like her parenting. The fair call know my wife and family and that whole interaction, I think that. Was."
759.0,Provider,"A big one okay. And next time we can talk more about coping skills for your ADHD and how to cope with your flashbacks okay. You know, one of the things you can do when you're having flashbacks you know how we talked about creating safety within yourself in. Thinking of like a safe place and just reminding yourself that you're safe, you know that you're safe in this moment i'm safe in this moment, you know and just repeating out to yourself. And just being able to kind of like develop a place where it's your safe place that you go to when you're starting to have intensity moments of anxiety or flashbacks. kind of like my background today, and you know the status the ocean having like a. Community like moment you know for yourself and just remaining present in the moment when dealing with flashbacks that can help a lot. And to comfort yourself to make sure that you're doing your self care, have you been keeping up with your self care lately."
15762.0,Patient,"Lately, I think I have as much as I can, while traveling. I don't have like. All the things I have on hand when traveling by like I guess to my best capability, I have been taking care of myself. Okay well and."
759.0,Provider,"ain't getting proper uh you, you said that you've been having some insomnia, found the Nice that you're not having some yeah you gain proper rest."
15762.0,Patient,"Yes, I feel like. I feel like i've been. Well rested. But I think I do tend to sleep more than the normal. Like at least 910 or 11 hours of sleep every day."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm does that do you wake up feeling rested like you feel you feel good after you had those number of hours of sleep.
15762.0,Patient,"yeah I do wake up feeling rested. And normally I always have really usually have nightmares never usually a pleasant dream, but nightmare where there's a lot of tension and I don't know some conflict."
759.0,Provider,That I. can't.
15762.0,Patient,"get over Oh, and I always have recurring like similar dreams, about being in a classroom setting and i'm struggling I don't know where my locker is maybe or maybe I don't know the combination to my luck or i'm struggling to look on my calendar planner of where my next classes are so. i've had those very often, and I think it's because it's like a reminder like subconsciously that i've struggled because of ADHD and in like. Like back then in high school or middle school like this little thing that shouldn't be a problem was like a big problem for me, or like a struggle like I had trouble organizing or kind of knowing where to go next with small stuff."
759.0,Provider,"This stuff okay. yeah like. recurring dreams of the same thing by just be alerting alerting you to stress that you're dealing with you know, in terms of school in itself, you know, sometimes it can be stressful for you right."
15762.0,Patient,yeah.
759.0,Provider,"So maybe. yeah very stressful and having ADHD doesn't help you know, in terms of your concentration. and focus and different things of that nature, like i'm know dream interpreter, but it might just be alerting good, because sometimes dreams play on our subconscious so just might be logging into some of that stress that to have if that makes sense."
15762.0,Patient,yeah I definitely think so.
759.0,Provider,"And you know another thing you can do like i'm pretty sure you heard of grounding techniques, you know in terms. of being able to ground yourself in a moment, by either an object, or you know, like, I want to look up grounding techniques, you know, in terms of. You can go on YouTube and when you watch a video of what to do you know, like the 5432 method like list, everything is fighting So you can see four things you can hear I think i'm wrong, but let me tell you that, right now, and 5432 about that. So, with the fire for dream new method it's basically. Five things you can see four things you can touch reading she can hear two things that you can. smell, and one thing you can taste so that's a quick like grounding technique, you know. So I want you to look good grounding techniques, if that makes sense and see how you can better ground yourself in the moment where you're having a flashback you know either by doing something or mindfulness technique that can help you does that make sense. yeah."
15762.0,Patient,i'll definitely look into that. sounds like a good technique.
759.0,Provider,"yeah it's a technique to try for sure yeah Okay, so let me schedule you for next time. hold on just one moment. So the next time we'll need that it's going to be the. And what does. A time on the 12th usually doesn't work well for you, you can do it. Again, or just earlier time work well for you."
15762.0,Patient,For the 12 I have two classes. Pretty back back. Maybe 330 or 4pm work.
759.0,Provider,"yeah 4pm works. pitching down for the. Okay that's perfect okay so, but do you have planned for new year's."
15762.0,Patient,Nothing crazy planning to celebrate it at home do some cooking maybe open a bottle of wine watch me nothing crazy.
759.0,Provider,"Nothing crazy okay good, well, I hope we have a good new years you know, like in terms of celebrating the best way that you see fit and I hope it's fun okay."
15762.0,Patient,Thank you have a happy New Year also.
759.0,Provider,Here bye.
