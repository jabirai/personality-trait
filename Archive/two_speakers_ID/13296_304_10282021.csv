13296.0,Patient,hi Lisa.
304.0,Provider,hey rich i'm so sorry about that.
13296.0,Patient,"Oh that's okay it's a way to come. It has caught me off guard i'm like Oh, did I just did I press the wrong something."
304.0,Provider,you're fine well good to see you um. yeah he's. A little anxious on Tuesday.
13296.0,Patient,Little. little anxious.
304.0,Provider,yeah are you still feeling like you're getting in your head a lot or.
13296.0,Patient,"I just I didn't sleep really well The night before and I had kind of already like. was running behind, and it was like the kind of set the press you know the precedents for the day I was just like lagging behind yeah um. You know."
304.0,Provider,yeah.
13296.0,Patient,"So I went out. today. I. Nothing really i'm not really overly anxious or arm or the other way either i'm just kind of today i'm kind of in the middle, actually, while I was waiting, I was, I was doing like the deep breathing exercises. i've been like. Finding myself. practicing that more and more, and it what i've realized is sometimes it just kind of like breaks me away and like lets me reconnect or even like go into a situation, a little more like refresh I don't know if that that's not really the best way to explain it but um. it's kind of like resetting I don't know I guess."
304.0,Provider,"yeah no absolutely I mean I think like when we talked about in group, even just like the breath just does so much because it's literally like it is just resetting it's like fully oxygenate in your brain and your blood vessels and. yeah I think. you're just so far ahead in some ways i'm just yes i'm just."
13296.0,Patient,"Oh, my goodness, I feel like so."
304.0,Provider,Much for yourself.
13296.0,Patient,yeah I.
304.0,Provider,But.
13296.0,Patient,it's like you have.
304.0,Provider,i'm sorry go ahead.
13296.0,Patient,"Just like you had said on on Tuesday i'm i'm learning to. um. it's like I I put so much pressure on myself, you know and and if I like fall short just a little bit you know, in the sense of i'm. i'm not doing enough prop comes up or sometimes we just need to take a day and just and just relax and you know, sometimes i'll think like oh i'm being unproductive you know or and and what i've been. trying to do, and this is very recently is allow myself permission to do those things allow myself, you know what I mean like I actually have to say it like to myself, and you know, in my mind just um. You know."
304.0,Provider,"yeah because that's part of like wellness and recovery, too, if you think about rich like when you were in your addiction like that took up just this huge piece of the pie."
13296.0,Patient,"Oh, my goodness."
304.0,Provider,And it left really no room for anything else.
13296.0,Patient,No.
304.0,Provider,"And, like all the things that you're doing are so wonderful for your health and your recovery as far as meetings and meditation and, yes, sorry. OK, I can bring it to me. um but, but you know same thing with like doing all of your groups and your meetings and your meditations like. Sometimes you just need some time. To just relax or like, if you want to just go for a walk like you could just walk in like not think that anything like you don't have to be mindful. Like I think fruit, I think a lot of people need more mindfulness and more deep breathing and more groups, but like you can have fun to like it's Okay, for you to watch a silly movie with your grandpa or."
13296.0,Patient,You know.
304.0,Provider,Give yourself at. That break too. yeah I totally.
13296.0,Patient,"I totally agree, I would have liked to i'm with a dog actually my mom had a an appointment today and she lives like just a block away from from where I where I live, and. that's really horrible weather it's like dreary and grey and rainy and so just was an ideal, you know and i'll just like. On I call her i'm like mom I have like this zoom saying, do you mind if I if I go pop in at your House i'm I have a total I like I have her it's her dog, you know. And I let her know i'm like I got the dog and she's with me and she's like yeah you know it's fine arm, and so it just is kind of cool just to go to a neutral place. Like not that my my grandfather wouldn't mind he completely 100% supports me but um you know this is different, it didn't work out. To go for a walk but you know this was kind of cool you know the dog, you know she's she's happy because she's with me school. yeah."
304.0,Provider,"yeah whatever works and and your flexibility to like I think it's just amazing that like well if it's true you know, like Oh, I really want to go for a walk and it's dreary and rainy but I come to do this instead."
13296.0,Patient,"i've been trying to practice more of that and. In practice, more of. I don't know it was like I heard the same message at least five times and just a matter of days, and it was it's okay to not be okay you don't have to be perfect, and it really it was like enough to kind of drill into my stubborn, mind you know, like Maybe I should like. Listen to these things that i'm actually hearing. You know, and try them so. I made a couple of really cool connections. I spoke with somebody I mentioned about expanding my my network and support and I spoke to someone and she she is going to connect me with. With this guy who he's actually a psychologist and they have like a work program and they they get together with you, and they kind of help you, you know people that struggle with like anxiety and depression and they kind of help you work through those things, and it can lead to. Employment and even like placement or school or you know there's just a wide variety of directions and opportunities that I could go to you know. And this is, this is what this guy does he's just a really I listened to the webinar arm like in the summer might listen to it and I reached out to the host to lead. With the webinar out, you know and i'm like i'd really like to connect with this guy and learn some more and see if that, because what I really do want to be able to get back to work, and this would be kind of a positive step in that direction, you know I think you know i'm actually. Going into it with an open mind and see what's you know, trying to see what's there you know."
304.0,Provider,"yeah oh no that would be awesome for you, I was just gonna ask you so are you finished with that Depression and anxiety group."
13296.0,Patient,"um I did graduate I did graduate arm I got like a certificate or whatever, for you know the completion, but um I still go because I still get a lot out of it on some of the material. I may have gone over before, but I realized, you know, like going into it now i'm in a different place so I get I get more out of it, you know or i'll i'll. i'll get something out of it this time that may be, if we had gone over it before maybe I didn't pick up last time you know and so it's it's cool you know and um. it's just kind of a safe place and positive environment and I did recently start a new group i'm i'm about halfway into it and it's for like you know, like trauma, as well as like it's regarding ptsd. um you know and because I was sort of inquisitive and had a you know kind of inquired you know what what, if any, are there other groups that maybe I could learn from our benefit from, and you know and so um. it's it's quite in depth and there's parts of it that are pretty heavy and you know you can't help but think about, you know as as we've grown up in different things. But it's also really powerful any touch on a lot of the mindfulness stuff and the grounding techniques and. arm. it's just I think it's just like adding an additional. strength to you know. The direction i'm heading I don't know it's. kind of cool it's you know some of it is not the easiest you know. But I think there's a lot of good in it."
304.0,Provider,"Oh definitely its growth in it can be uncomfortable. It can be difficult, you know I don't wanna say difficult it can be uncomfortable. yeah, but I think your perspective about just like you're always wanting to grow you're always wanting to learn more just to improve yourself so. yeah and it sounds like maybe getting getting back to work, might be a long term goal, and maybe it sounds like what you're talking about is sometimes they call it vocational rehabilitation."
13296.0,Patient,So I think it's. I think they've actually have connections to.
304.0,Provider,Like to employer.
13296.0,Patient,"Rehabilitation services, I think, is what it's called. Okay yeah I think there's something connected there I i'm going to learn some more when I talked to the other man."
304.0,Provider,"yeah yeah and a lot of. right kind of the interventions will be targeted towards like yeah just employment and then like yeah connecting you with employers. yeah are familiar, and even that kind of the environment is like a more safe and supportive environment or it can be kind of tailored to like if your. If your anxiety is around social interactions like yeah maybe you won't be in the front of the store maybe you'll be in the back things like that so."
13296.0,Patient,"yeah and then yeah I know one thing is, you know they they do like kind of like resume building interviewing techniques and. You know just how to present yourself to an employer on it, you know, during an interview, and I think there's a lot of valuable stuff that could be found there you know so i'm kind of excited but it's like that. excited but, yet the little now I don't want to say afraid, but maybe slightly apprehensive you know she. Was. You know, open minded you know, and then I the other connection that I made is a guy that's in recovery and he's he was he spoke at at another webinar that I had gone that I went to. and Things like a really cool guy you know and he's he's i'm kind of like athletic and he's very outdoorsy and, as you know, I love to be outdoors and i'm. This this other individual had had thought you know, maybe it'd be cool if we got connected and spoke, and you know see. see what see what comes of it, I have no idea of just going again with an open mind and and he's. He seems like a really cool positive guy and you know, and so that that could be something that. could put me in a position to meet some other cool positive people you know so that's what i'm trying to do it's it hasn't been the easiest journey but um i've never given up I just keep trying, you know."
304.0,Provider,"And I think like that realistic I think that's just like another huge strengths of yours right, just like. That ability to really kind of honestly look at yourself and like realistically appraise where you're at like to be able to kind of, say, like you know what like this is where I am right now. And I think, then, then you do get a little down on yourself so we'll keep working on that, but also like I think that's a huge strength of yours. To like realistically look at where you're at right now and and you're not saying you know you don't know you're in the daytime group. there's a guy in our nighttime group who like struggled like he was on disability, for a long time and they really just had so many challenges that. He could not work you are while he was pursuing disability he got denied, but then he goes and he's working like two jobs and he's working overtime and he's working like 80 hours a week, you know i'm always telling him like it's just some it's going to crash. something's gonna crash either the job. or hopefully not your recovery or your relationships, like in it's happening, you know. So I was like."
13296.0,Patient,that's a huge.
304.0,Provider,"Extreme changing change yeah so like that's what's amazing where you are is like you have the skill set and, just like the maturity and the support to kind of recognize like you know. Like let me do this sort of VOC rehab stuff and like let someone helped me with my resume let someone help me like do a practice interview because I haven't done an interview in a long time, like. it's just. so different that you're able to kind of sit back and. Look at your strengths and look at where you know your strengths, but also see like where your enemy want to say weaknesses are but just areas that you like need help and then you go and get that help."
13296.0,Patient,"most often Oh, and I think the biggest thing for me at the end of the day is you know. I get really. Really kind of caught up and sometimes you know we get in our own little bubble, you know and and one thing i've been noticing as i've been trying to keep. Again, the word mindful I don't want to like burn that word out but it's it's become pretty powerful for me recently and but you know just looking for those opportunities and seeing where maybe I could be helpful to somebody else. And i'll sometimes it's just a matter of like at a four way stop letting somebody go in front of you or or holding a door open for somebody. or doing something for my grandfather without him having to ask me, you know and and you know I. I feel so much better when i'm able to put my to be in that kind of mindset, then when i'm so consumed with I gotta do this, I have to be there, I you know and and then like beat myself up because I maybe i'm not doing well enough or. Or, as well as I think I should be doing, you know that if that makes any sense. But um. yeah and and I think there's something there to to be said about. You know, Community and in reaching out and and thinking of others, and you know, maybe not to a point where. You completely lose yourself and you neglect the things that like we need to do for ourselves, but um you know so that it's not we're not stuck into that all about me place you know yeah because it it doesn't it's like what what were we talking about um. You know, worrying, and I could worry something to death, but Lorraine and it's it's not The more I worry it's not going to give me an ability to control it or change it um you know and it puts you through this whole. Completely unnecessarily painful process, you know and it's, it is nice like no fun being there you know so i've got you know I have good days and i'm finding i'm having a little bit more, better day and I keep looking for, though."
304.0,Provider,"yeah yeah anything just that. Like self tolerance or just self yeah like taking it easy on yourself and not not beating yourself up that that you're not perfect, but that's part of it to. And then, especially like yeah I love just the things that you're doing for other people where you're looking outside yourself, and I think that is just so healthy because it's so easy to get you know for everybody, like you, you're in your own little world everybody is you know. Something just like step back, I think, especially with coven like with everything that has happened in the past year. Like just showing that kindness to strangers i'm sure it just like makes their day and you don't know what they were going through and that like change someone's life, you know."
13296.0,Patient,that's cool line.
304.0,Provider,yeah like restore their their faith there. yeah.
13296.0,Patient,"I actually had somebody thank me that you know cuz she I was, I think I I went through the line I don't know if it was a grocery store can't remember what it was I had I had run some errands and um I could tell she was kind of grumpy. And so I just took a moment I just asked her on i'm like. I don't know what I said I just just something to like switch it around you know. And I showed her a little bit of kindness and she's like you know what you're the first person that's been polite to me and that's probably why I was grumpy is because everybody before you just so rude everybody's in a hurry and. You know and you're just like Take your time i'm not in a hurry and I don't know I you know I just."
304.0,Provider,yeah that's.
13296.0,Patient,I think it makes a difference. You know I thought.
304.0,Provider,"This was showing you, you know I mean, thankfully, you know your grandfather has you your mom has you but. I mean, I can give out like a lot of elderly people, especially with coven with all the shutdowns like that might have been there only like interaction with like a person that whole day if they live alone, you know and then like especially coven they didn't even leave their house so. Like for that one interaction, to be a kind."
13296.0,Patient,yeah.
304.0,Provider,You got this rich just keep Keep it up keep doing what you're doing and.
13296.0,Patient,"I honestly and i'm being really hopeful here but um it's very new still I think it's just a couple of weeks, new on the new medicine, but I think i'm like adjusting. fairly well to it, you know i'm i'm trying to i've been like learning, you know, I have to like take it a little earlier because it's been affecting like like i've been having a little trouble falling asleep when I would when I want to. it's been a little bit harder to get up in the morning and so i've been kind of like taking it earlier, and it seems to make a difference and I know it's just probably part of the getting used to it."
304.0,Provider,um is it taking it twice a day rich.
13296.0,Patient,"Know it's time released on cymbalta and um yeah and so like I, from what I understand it, can it can help with like Depression and anxiety, but it can also help with nerve related pain like with the migraines and things that."
304.0,Provider,"You mentioned that in group and so i'm sorry, so you said you're taking it in the morning."
13296.0,Patient,uh huh yeah and I I was taking it a like nine or 10 in the morning and recently i've been trying like closer towards eight in the morning.
304.0,Provider,"Yes, and because if you're finding that it's still. Like keeping you up at night. Thinking it like yeah first thing when you wake up."
13296.0,Patient,"yeah and it's i've been doing that for a few days and it's I think it's making a difference. And like I said it's only been a couple of weeks, so they say what it's like four to six weeks before you really know like how you're going to respond to it."
304.0,Provider,"yeah yeah and definitely it can yeah I mean yeah you're taking it for the headaches, but it can definitely help with mood and. yeah yeah help with your your depression, anxiety so yeah but if it is if it is affecting your ability to go to sleep like maybe just try taking it earlier, and then you may be very sensitive to to just caffeine. So if you do any sodas or coffee or anything, maybe cut it off like past three."
13296.0,Patient,"yeah I was it I don't know, I think it was, I think it might have been one of my groups that the half life of caffeine is like five hours. So, like if you have a cup of coffee, at noon. five hours, from then it's still within your system, about half the strength from the time that you originally drank it. that's you. Even as a long yeah."
304.0,Provider,In half of it would still be in your system at 6pm.
13296.0,Patient,"mm hmm yeah and then and then um what is it five hours, beyond that, then it breaks down to 25% so I mean it's really sticks with you."
304.0,Provider,"It really sticks with you gosh. I can't sleep if I. I know that's like my evening, let me just have one little piece of chocolate, but chocolate, a lot of caffeine, and not a lot, but like people don't think you know there's there's caffeine, and things that sometimes we don't."
13296.0,Patient,i'm a big fan of. of dark chocolate I love dark chocolate.
304.0,Provider,And those that have more or less caffeine.
13296.0,Patient,I think it's a little more I think it's more concentrated.
304.0,Provider,yeah yeah right.
13296.0,Patient,"And you know i'm a coffee drinker you know I love coffee so. The dark cut you know the dark chocolate, not as sweet, so I don't know I think that's why I like yeah."
304.0,Provider,"yeah, but I think yeah everything you're doing rich definitely like just your your walks like physical activity drinking enough water like it sounds. It sounds so basic, but I think it's just getting into the habit and i'm like well I drank all my water yesterday, like what I had to drink water again today. So yeah just hopefully it just becomes routine."
13296.0,Patient,"I went through a pretty rough spell there for a while, you know, through a lot of things out of perspective, but you know my agency jumped off and then since then. Just a couple of weeks ago, or a few weeks ago I seen my primary had some new blood work done i've been able to get my a one see back down i've lost a few more pounds. um you know and so like I i'm i'm definitely heading in the right direction it's just I need to keep chipping away that and that the things that i'm doing you know."
304.0,Provider,"yeah yeah in kind of you know one thing at a time because it's hard to it's overwhelming to like make a bunch of changes at once, but I think you're making these little changes, a little bit out of time."
13296.0,Patient,"Trying to sometimes I try to I try to do them all, at the same time, but."
304.0,Provider,yeah well i'm getting there.
13296.0,Patient,Running my limitations.
304.0,Provider,"Exactly, yes, well, I think I have my waiting room on now, but I don't want us to get. Get cut off by the next person here."
13296.0,Patient,Oh sure.
304.0,Provider,"I want to reschedule you like, we can two weeks from now is going to be like November. My kids are off school on November 11 so i'm probably not going to work much that day. But I remember 12th. Is a Friday, or the following week is the. Thursday or the 19th Friday is pretty open as well, so."
13296.0,Patient,um let's do I think Thursday would be probably better.
304.0,Provider,"Okay yeah you want to kind of stick stick with thursday's okay let's see so Thursday kind of around the same time i'm. Not quite quite the same time, I have 230."
13296.0,Patient,Well that's fine.
304.0,Provider,Perfect okay.
13296.0,Patient,yeah what was I got the day but um I didn't catch what was the date on that day.
304.0,Provider,November 18.
13296.0,Patient,Okay okay awesome.
304.0,Provider,And that was at at 230.
13296.0,Patient,"Okay, I got it. You know I think I made a difference actually stopping and sitting in a chair, instead of being always on the go like I I got a lot more out of our other thing today oh."
304.0,Provider,"Good good, well, especially if it's raining that that would not be the most. Therapeutic setting to be out in the rain and."
13296.0,Patient,"I don't want to keep you because i'm sure you have a schedule, you want to want to keep up with, but it was really good talking with you and I will see you next week."
304.0,Provider,Okay sounds good rich have a great rest of your day.
13296.0,Patient,"You too, take care."
