233.0,Provider,"Okay sounds good anything else that should be on the list, or we pretty good they're."
4819.0,Patient,Good apart from an email every once in a while or ask them.
233.0,Provider,Okay sounds good so. Focusing first on the opioid use and the pain issues right we've got you taking the suboxone the eight to the three films a day 24 milligrams and that's been fairly consistent for you here for a while you've been doing really well very stable on those. hasn't been helping with your chronic pain issues. Good and remind me where you feel that those chronic pain issue that.
4819.0,Patient,"Well i'm in my lower back. Okay, and my neck, of course, after the accident. I just. I am signed up for new physical therapy, because when I did my MRI they found that I didn't have any compression and my. Sorry for getting everything my spinal cord so. Getting back into the physical therapy, we can do a little bit more aggressive, so I can get better movement in my neck because right now i'm with you, and so we can be a little bit more aggressive, but right now experiencing a lot more pain in my lower left abdomen. And I think it's actually hernia is. happening currently and another hernia so it's getting a little bit more defined. So if I figure out if it's not blocking anything or doing anything that's my inside. And I don't have to have surgery I won't if I can get around that. If it is then i'd have to have surgery that's part of the issue that i'm having with my bowel movement. But we'll see once I get my sonogram."
233.0,Provider,"Sure, so the difficulty around having surgery and say you're at the maximum dose of the box known right and so that doesn't leave a whole lot of room for pain management is after your surgery. that's something really to consider and with all of these chronic pain issues. We know that tobacco can make things worse house what's happening with your smoking."
4819.0,Patient,"i'm when I wake up i'm not smoking in the morning. And I think I came back, I was in high impact, a little over a pack a day and now i'm. A little under a pack a day, I can say. i'm not smoking i'm cutting out smoking probably around six o'clock at night and i'm not smoking. be like, if I get up I won't smoke within the first half hour, I can say. well."
233.0,Provider,what's up i'm sorry.
4819.0,Patient,"If I can stretch it longer I will like if I get busy or if i'm on. Okay, with me."
233.0,Provider,yeah yeah obviously people use tobacco it's kind of a stress reliever right that's often way when many people use it for and so trying to work through behavioral health and finding those working with those healthy ways of dealing with stress instead of moving. into the chemicals to deal with stress.
4819.0,Patient,say when I.
233.0,Provider,"yeah yeah so here's what i'd like to suggest, and you may be aware of that of this that i'm going to tell you, but. And I talked about it in group, but in tobacco, there are thousands of chemical right hundreds of them cause body problems emphysema cancer joint pain all that kind of kind of stuff only one chemical is addictive and that's the nicotine. So if we can get people over to a nicotine replacement where they're working with that addictive old that one addictive chemical then we get rid of all the other ones that are causing bodily problem. Right and that can be through patches that can be through like wellbutrin maybe Chan tech, so we use long acting stuff but then also a short acting thing, like the gum the was inches even the vapor. Right, so that that the long acting stuff takes care of most of the cravings, but when you a person does have breakthrough craving there's a short acting thing that can help manage those instead of reaching."
4819.0,Patient,I talked. To a guy. doing whatever project he manages this complaint and he was using this small thing and a little wooden box. And it wasn't a bait and. I want to reach out to him and see what that is because it's a replacement also but it's not a bait.
233.0,Provider,"Okay yeah definitely do, and then we can have more of a conversation around this because I think you know there's some of those basic things that if we can get taken care of can help you feel better in so many ways. Right and tobacco is one of those so if we can do a long acting nicotine replacement with also whatever that box thing is a short acting nicotine replacement get rid of those chemical. That would be great and then working in behavioral health to deal with those stress issues can be really good also now generally, we recommend the nicotine replacement for like nine to 12 months right, not just a brief period, a long time so that one can work on the therapy aspect."
4819.0,Patient,yeah.
233.0,Provider,"yeah so that's something we can have more of a conversation about did you work out what to do, and of course you can get the patches through the one 800 quit now I can also send those in for you, whatever works, we can certainly work with that okay. i'm moving on to the next thing I know that alcohol was previously a difficulty you'd mentioned that quite a while ago, how was that but I haven't talked to you about that recently what's happening with alcohol for you."
4819.0,Patient,"And I had a couple of drinks and basically i'm going to tell you it's, not because I wanted to have a drink. I wanted to see with all the lines and the clocks that I was having. I know it's weird but. I tried it, knowing that it's in your blood and what I found is that I had. Fewer. Of those thick lines in my face. And down my. And also actually helped me. So I didn't drink a lot, I had a shot yeah but i'm thinking you know cuz I want to talk to my doctor is something that I can get for blood thinning this might help with what's going on with my face and my neck. And because he's been very obvious it actually is something."
233.0,Provider,"Okay yeah certainly we wouldn't recommend alcohol is the treatment right we don't want to go down that road, I hear what you're saying about just a blood thinner and I think that's a very good idea to have a conversation with your doctor about that. When before the holiday time when was your last drink what's been happening with that specifically around the alcoholic so."
4819.0,Patient,"I tried it a couple times, probably a. week and a half ago, maybe."
233.0,Provider,"Okay Okay, so are you does it seem like you're doing better with the alcohol."
4819.0,Patient,"It does calm a little bit I mean I can't say it doesn't but. I wouldn't mind getting on something that does give me some cleaning. I don't want the alcohol for sure, but I wouldn't mind getting."
233.0,Provider,On yeah.
4819.0,Patient,level feeling like a. Not an agitated feeling all the time.
233.0,Provider,"yeah so there's some things that we can talk about it basically with alcohol what we're kind of talking with this would be medication that might help out with. craving you get craving for alcohol. Okay okay. it's more there's this agitation and that's kind of a separate issue from the alcohol itself just seems like sometimes the alcohol might help out with the agitation that's what i'm here. yeah okay so we'll we'll get to that here, then as kind of our our next thing. We have you taking the deluxe with team that's the cymbalta the 20 milligrams to help out with anxiety and depression, which the agitation, then, can kind of fit in with also, if I remember correctly it's still the 20 milligrams one today that correct."
4819.0,Patient,Oh no.
233.0,Provider,Two pills a day.
4819.0,Patient,"Well, I like telling me."
233.0,Provider,Just one pill a day okay I haven't been to. And you get on this. For quite a while.
4819.0,Patient,"yeah I don't think I really noticed a big difference with that. my sister told me before my sisters were on something similar, and whatever that is made from my sister told me what it was, but whatever that. substance is made from has a different reaction to her to my sisters. So they went on something. I don't know, there was like that the family of that drugs."
233.0,Provider,Okay. sure.
4819.0,Patient,"They can't take it, so they are taking something different."
233.0,Provider,"Okay, but we don't know what that family of that drug is, nor do we know what the different thing is."
4819.0,Patient,I can ask my sister.
233.0,Provider,"Again, yes that'd be good, so the deadlocks a team can work really well for depression, anxiety and that agitation situation you're on a very low dose of 20 milligram. So it doesn't surprise me, honestly, but you haven't felt too much if there would be the thought of increasing that if you would like to to twice a day. and seeing if that's helping out, you can also hold off find out what your siblings are taking, and then we could have another separate appointment is visually not during group but individually to kind of work through that if you would like to work through that a little bit to."
4819.0,Patient,What.
233.0,Provider,Would that be a good idea.
4819.0,Patient,Okay.
233.0,Provider,Good though I saw some of your goals were improved health and. fitness in the surveys that you were doing. Tell me about those what's happening there for you.
4819.0,Patient,"know I think i've been walking. and Mostly it's like out here, I can't really can go for a walk but you know we're out here in this kind of thing. I can walk around the property and stuff but what I like to do like to go to wherever the stores out here in Santa fe and i'll just parked my car and walk through the parking lot to the storefront and around rid of them all outside I don't like going inside. But that's kind of the limit to that right now and I figured once I get started back with a physical therapy, I can get some ideas of what I can handle right now and. Maybe go to the gym out here. and start doing a little bit of upper body and things that I can do that aren't going to hurt myself immediately I you know constantly and. he's to build a studio everything running everything and I loved it, and that was my was my garage."
233.0,Provider,"Very good yeah so it sounds like that's kind of that was in the past right away potentially. Certainly talking with. The physical therapist as you work things out will be good, but I do as as people are are get older, myself included, we have to start off a little more gradually right so even stuff like yoga that helps to loosen up the joint stretch things out. give more. range of motion can be a really nice way of starting and. getting into other things so that you're not injuring yourself along the way. So a yoga class might be an interesting thought for you have you tried yoga or what are your impressions there."
4819.0,Patient,there's a friend of mine. Who has a relative who has a class on Tuesdays on Internet and I started going to back and bought. me I can easily pick that back up again.
233.0,Provider,"yeah so that might be a good way to initiate things now again. Talk to the physical therapist is they evaluate you and see where things are at right I don't know if that's a good, it is so that would be the first step and then yoga potentially after that."
4819.0,Patient,yeah good idea.
233.0,Provider,"Good good. Of the final thing that I had that I wanted to check with you about the whole parasite issue because i'm not in the loop as to what's going on there parasites are really, really uncommon they don't happen much and it sounds."
4819.0,Patient,"Looking for I had it. last discussion I had with. Dr holly did when he was treating me for the cancer on my face with that cream. And then, after I was complete with the Korean and we went in and she said i'm going to have to do another round is cream, I had a pretty solid discussion list here and I said, you know, some of them, we do a biopsy a lot of times the findings come out I don't I don't know the medical. verbiage for that, but. You can get the same reading from a parasite if you can kill cancer. And she agreed and she also agreed that the line and the tunneling we're not cancer and then she also said she has no idea what it is and she's not. she's a cancer doctor she's not. A doctor for parasites or infectious disease or anything like that, because I don't know what it is, you know it could be a parasite it could be some infection in my body, it could be anything. But what leads me to believe it could be a parasite is the tunneling type of thing that's happening. and interesting layers you know it's it's weird it's hard to explain, but it would be like. they'll be like a. alive align that opens up it dries up and then it'll do it underneath again and then it'll do it again and. So she did agree with me and. Then she said that she would send me to an infectious disease doctor. The doctor I went to before and then she sent me to you, and then you and me, told me that they needed biopsies and test. And gina the you know target said that she doesn't do a lot in you and me, but they don't do that so i'm kind of in an in between things aren't knowing who's gonna do any tests or anything to understand what this is. Because it doesn't it won't go away. i'm down with you."
233.0,Provider,And you broke up you. You broke up just briefly um did you are you seeing a dermatologist.
4819.0,Patient,A skin doctor with. Her name that you network with Boston medical.
233.0,Provider,"Okay, because often dermatologists do skin biopsy that's very common but I heard you say that they don't."
4819.0,Patient,he's not doing it because she's a she's a cancer doctor she doesn't do that.
233.0,Provider,So a cancer doctor is an oncologist i'm wondering if you're seeing a dermatologist.
4819.0,Patient,he's a dermatologist he specializes in camp.
233.0,Provider,"So you might want to ask her if there's a general dermatologist that she would recommend that. You see, if she's not gonna do it if it's out of. If it's not what she does. asked her if there's a general dermatologist. That can further help you with this this process because it sounds like you need to get those biopsies done and that would be through a dermatologist. They can see what's going on and then see if maybe connect you with you mmm infectious disease. So. What you can do there now. here's The thing that that we often not often but at times that we see that happens in medicine and I don't want to upset you with this, but I want to put the. Seed in your mind as you're considering all these things as people get bounced around from provider to provider it's often with frustration from the provider, because they don't know what to do, and they also don't think that there's really anything going on. Right, so that can be a little bit, but they don't want to tell the they feel bad telling the patient that. Sometimes, especially when there are. Issues along the way. Right, so I don't know, but sometimes. Those sensations or what people are feeling can be doomed to the addiction issues and not due to say parasites or things like that. Now again i'm not wanting to upset you, I just want to put that that thought in your mind that there might not be the parasites, or the other issue there certainly following up with the specific dermatologists and taking those steps is certainly fine, but just keep open to that possibility."
4819.0,Patient,yeah okay.
233.0,Provider,Okay sounds good sounds good. Good we covered a lot of things in there is there is there more that you were hoping to discuss with it.
4819.0,Patient,"Well, actually. was wondering. I don't have a psychologist now. I don't know what happened last year, my. My therapist left for her own business. Because I needed to touch base with them. But I was wondering if you might be able to take over with prescribing medication or to do lock. That. suffer would that be something that I need my primary to do."
233.0,Provider,"So, certainly with the docs a team that falls in the realm of anxiety depression that correlates a lot with. The addiction issues, so I can certainly work with that remind me what you're taking the topamax for."
4819.0,Patient,What the Max was for the alcohol.
233.0,Provider,"Okay. Yes, I can take that over to you that's like."
4819.0,Patient,person.
233.0,Provider,"and abuse person that's usually for anxiety. Right Okay, and the abuse bro and I had five milligrams I think it was was it twice a day or three times a day."
4819.0,Patient,We had me down to one day.
233.0,Provider,"One time a day, are you weaning off the best to what's happening there."
4819.0,Patient,"Well, they had kept putting me down, I actually never saw the psychiatry because they kept. Leading and then I keep getting that alternate you know interim okay. yeah gotcha."
233.0,Provider,"Okay, and the the do lots of teen we had said was the 20 milligrams one time a day and the topamax 100 milligrams how much a day."
4819.0,Patient,Night you mind if I grabbed the bottles are right there.
233.0,Provider,No that's fine go ahead.
4819.0,Patient,30 milligram.
233.0,Provider,Day.
4819.0,Patient,"plus one hospital by now twice a day, but they had me on one time a day."
233.0,Provider,When we will keep it at one time a day for now and then we'll work out you'll talk with family members to people were at. The token is how much how often.
4819.0,Patient,Make one problem by now every night at that time 50 milligram.
233.0,Provider,"50 milligrams okay. Now, do you need refills on those at this point, or how are you."
4819.0,Patient,yeah well.
233.0,Provider,"Okay, so i'll get those three sent in for you, I do want to make sure that we follow up with an individual appointment in four weeks to see how some of this is going so that's going to be February 3. So that we make sure that we continue to address these issues that we're talking about."
4819.0,Patient,really did like me to call the clinic and.
233.0,Provider,Know i'll take care of it.
4819.0,Patient,"And the book perowne is. I have extras just because they. It still says, three times a day and they had me take one tablet a day. Okay, well, I have excellent on those. Okay."
233.0,Provider,"So i'm going to go ahead and send in a prescription for one time a day, but just for 30 days with no refill you've got enough to carry it forward and we'll keep talking about things, to make sure we know what's going on. Okay alright so i'm going to get those taken care of and we're going to bend plan on a follow up appointment on February 3 about about 1220 does that sound good.
