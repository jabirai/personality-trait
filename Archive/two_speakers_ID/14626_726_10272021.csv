14626.0,Patient,um. I.
726.0,Provider,Have.
14626.0,Patient,"been I started using opiates about the age of 25 i'm 40 now i'm. I got and clean long as i've gotten clean. i'm was about 18 months well I relapse. yeah i'm pregnant, it was illegal one Nice and. So now i've added back in the whole. becky using heroin and meth. And i'm just exhausted with it on the money. again. The finance part of it and i'm just not happy all around so. I thought I should try suboxone again. Last time I tried it I didn't really care for it, it didn't seem to help. That was taken opiates such as. bike it in norco and never tried suboxone for the heroin withdrawal button up until just recently so i'm still trying to see how it works. um I always said that I wouldn't do methadone I did you methadone but I got off of it, and that was hard I got really sick and. So I thought okay well, let me try suboxone so right now with. Where i'm at and i'm. Using it it's um i'm trying to say if I need more I don't know I just try not to jump the gun, I guess, I it's kind of hard but. So that's kind of where I am I just wanted to get off. of getting older i'm ready to just. need a Jewish me to be able to. get off of it, but I still need something, unfortunately."
726.0,Provider,"Okay, and tear up when you when you got off methadone how long has it been since you've been off of it, and what was the highest dose that you were at while you were on methadone."
14626.0,Patient,"I was at 105 and around May was the last time I had it. would end up doing and I missed an appointment and then you missed on me days and did it I. Know going. Next, you know I lost a lot of way, and then I was. feeling on heroin more and I just looked terrible and I felt terrible so you know you always hear that it's hard to get off of and. You know so every single just don't look back on it, but. It helped with the pain, a lot that I have fortunately i'm flagged every witch doctors and hospitals from going in and trying to get pills, that I do need pain medicine, but when I was in rehab treatment for those 18 months, he gave me length on. Some, like non narcotic well, it was um we can't remember what it was a. It was no rotten i'm sorry okay. Sometimes held within a move me to lyrica and that was helping so I didn't know if i'd be able to take lyrica and suboxone I gotta check into."
726.0,Provider,"That I would check, so I would check with the medical doctor there's always like a MED follow up um while you're here, so the way that the program kind of does work is that every week, you have to attend groups. Well, I believe it's I don't know how many groups they've assigned to just one hour week."
14626.0,Patient,"yeah. So i'm. Really, yet have to do it, we have done it, because just some things have popped up and i'm not used to this yet so i'm okay rescheduled everything and made sure they did I would have me and getting in with you today and. So that worked out, but."
726.0,Provider,I am.
14626.0,Patient,"To make sure, on Monday that I got to figure out some way to remind myself of the all of it is."
726.0,Provider,"So what I can do is at towards the end of our session, if you want to write down your appointments I can go on the chart and I can give you the times and everything."
14626.0,Patient,um.
726.0,Provider,"But what I would suggest is try to show up to your groups and show up to the individual sessions. and provide your screens where they sent you the the lab because what happens is once you're on the medication and you're getting your follow up and you're attempting everything. Then it's a lot easier, the doctor will just you know refill your prescriptions okay she's showing up and she's participating in her treatment. But if you know, sometimes we get people that aren't complying and they're not showing up and so. At that point, if someone's not showing up not not participating in their treatment, then they're at risk of discharge and so as long as you're showing up to the appointments um you should be totally fine. I when people on the one somebody's not really complying it's not that they just discharging money that's not how we work it's more like all right, so instead of giving giving this person seven days prescription we're just going to give them four days. So yeah. So if you're if someone's not complying they will start to kind of. restrict how much they're going to be sending you for this for this up."
14626.0,Patient,Somebody tells me.
726.0,Provider,"Okay, so um so we'll we'll take care of that at the end of the session will i'll give you all of your appointment date set that's in your chart So if you have like a pen and the paper you might want to write it down, just so you remember. Because it is easy to forget appointments."
14626.0,Patient,"Right oh yeah absolutely yeah. I know, especially with all of these ones they already are scheduling for me so i'm going to leave me a calendar today and. i'm a nyc is all down. They like today. I was requesting I didn't know what do you get a refill and girls like me sure I scheduled an appointment with you, so I guess maybe they see that to once I try to see if I can get a refill today."
726.0,Provider,yeah.
14626.0,Patient,"Well, he gave me five last time, I think it was two a day I don't remember but visit visit program be you know do sub you ticks or just about least."
726.0,Provider,"I think they're the same thing, but. But don't take my word for it, I would ask the doctor i'm pretty sure they're the same thing, but I. OK, I don't want to give you the right information."
14626.0,Patient,yeah I.
726.0,Provider,"So. They are so when you wanted to rehab treatment for 18 months how where was what time frame was that, like what year or one month, was it this year."
14626.0,Patient,"No, I got court order, and I was on probation probation or was very aware of my addiction, even though I was lying door so care of. The end I ended up going January of 2018 January 26 2018 I got out that. May April of."
726.0,Provider,Okay. And what facility was a.
14626.0,Patient,cloud flint odyssey house in flint Michigan.
726.0,Provider,Okay.
14626.0,Patient,It was. full time residential.
726.0,Provider,And how how did you feel when you were there.
14626.0,Patient,"um that program is tough I did learn a lot that was a fruit like I said, the first time I got clean like that um once I was able to understand my disease and get on all the right mental health meds. I felt good i've always been self medicating I didn't realize like mental health issues, I have, and I knew like depression, anxiety, but on top of all the other things like ADHD and bipolar you know, and once I got on all of those meds I was doing pretty good. What happened was is I ended up getting pregnant and the guy just didn't want nothing to do with it after he told me everything, so I read that and then I ended up having to get on the methadone because I was pregnant. And I end up. for adoption so. It was just like a trigger right then in there. And I just. went right for it."
726.0,Provider,When you place your child for adoption what year was at it.
14626.0,Patient,"um I had her on. January 29 of 20. yeah I mean she just turned a year this past January. Okay, go ahead or January 29 2020."
726.0,Provider,thing on terror Where are you living right now what's your living situation.
14626.0,Patient,"I live with my boyfriend in a hotel we pay like $60 a day it has you know certain amount of days it's a nice area, you know reasonable price. We can figure something else out."
726.0,Provider,"Okay, and does he use. Yes, Okay, and are you are you both currently using together."
14626.0,Patient,"Yes, this is my first relationship that i've been with i've been married i'm still legally married we're separated. By my husband never use i've never been released. Up until now, with him and he's the one that mainly gets it and the one that mainly gives it to me and he's been cutting me back and. it's been problems more so, but because he got every reason under the sun, but it kind of works, but then it kind of doesn't because it's like depriving me of when I know I need it and. it's more of a problem that's why I was like I really gotta stick with trying this suboxone because. I always said to people cannot be using in a relationship together it's. Not work and he hasn't he hasn't said, up until the other day that he wants to try the program as well."
726.0,Provider,And I.
14626.0,Patient,"Think that's a good idea, because I need your support, I say, well, I don't know how it'll be while you're using and I am trying not to. So."
726.0,Provider,"Sorry go ahead, you were you were saying I got there, I told I told them last night because I asked him when I called last night to verify some stuff."
14626.0,Patient,"I said they got the phone number he's like well, I want to do it, too, so I said all right we'll call it a day. easily 10 years older than me but. yeah my husband never used a drug, and he ended up finding out. And it just caused a lot of problems, unfortunately he's had two strokes and put a lot on me and my daughter just went to college and my son is 13. And he's home with his dad that tandy care because he will back in the apartment that I was in with my kids Well then, I was then takes over the bed I have nowhere to go, so I ended up just going with my boyfriend and kind of neglecting my children and i'm having a hard time that."
726.0,Provider,"yeah well, it sounds like you're struggling just with trying to keep it together day to day, so I imagine that being really hard to be a parent when you have so much of your own stuff that that that's happening at the same time."
14626.0,Patient,"You may want to make goals is is getting back on I was on 12 medications that on flint odyssey house to the nurse practitioner put me on in between, then I end up seeing a psychiatrist to. I my goal is to get back on my medications. As well these. With this treatment plan. And not rushing everything, because I am very Melinda. Over like wanting to do it all, at one time."
726.0,Provider,yeah okay.
14626.0,Patient,"And I have codependency issues as well as i'm i'm self sabotage her. And i'm a. People person so i'm a people pleaser and that's what game are stuck in you know. Like it's been battling where he's like held me up from going and getting my message on before and i'm like what is the problem is that's supposed to help me and I never really ever figured it out, but I. don't want that to be a problem, so this is really going to be a test for our relationship, I think."
726.0,Provider,yeah we'll.
14626.0,Patient,Get clean i'm not gonna want to deal with that if i'm doing it. i'm not going to want to deal with that.
726.0,Provider,"And I think also like whatever you put in front of your recovery will never last because unless your recovery is in the forefront of everything that you do everything will be destroyed by it, if you're not there. So, so I think if you and I know Tara like a lot of people they come into this program and you can feel better than you can feel better you can be in a better place in Europe right now um but it's a matter of you know i'm. going through follow through with appointments follow through, because then you're not gonna have any issues with getting your medications right have any issues with that, but if you're not showing up then that's a different situation on. And also, I had a question for you were you using fentanyl or was it. Something like I know you said opioid and heroin But was it fun."
14626.0,Patient,"yeah more like when I was using when I started using I was using pills. And I started, and while I was using pills for 15 years. ago pensive. And I was like oh i'll never stick a needle in my arm well Lo and behold want a home. game and how cheap, it was and which is like every story, I hear on every addict. I came to terms and i'm an addict or they have a disease that that all like game with terms in treatment late. As well as mental health problems I have. A President I when i'm postpartum psychosis really bad. Not gonna have no more children, next time, please my daughter for adoption, I had asked that out, because I have like I said this. Pregnancy I would be one that would like I said I hate to say it, but one of those moms that would take herself and her children, you know and drive in a lake or something I said I committed myself for 72 hours, when I had my son back in 2008. That I didn't I never had anxiety or depression until I had children."
726.0,Provider,"Okay, and so you have a 13 year old and then you set a kid that's a college."
14626.0,Patient,"She have she just started, and she just turned 18 in April. And then my son's 13 he's in seventh grade."

And I want to say that's it I have like some surgery, may I need to get taken care of just from having babies natural gravity taken over stuff like that um. i'll have to be, but other than that haven't had anything else so it's like whoa wait, but I lost a lot like I said when I got off that methadone it was bad, so I have a lot of dental problems right now going on, even having teeth pulled but. yeah and I use the I use heroin back then, it was like heroin before fentanyl really came in now it's. pretty much fit not loaded right now."
726.0,Provider,yeah.

Let me just make sure I cover everything that I wanted to ask you here i'm. All of you do all of your surveys, they all have good."

Okay yeah so now, I have a job I had student loans in a degree that now, and after that I got a felony because I was getting high and xanax went to walmart so my sister in law's credit card and thought I was super woman and bought all kinds of crap and. didn't even. hear until the next day, when I sobered up and they brought pictures of me at walmart all this stuff was horrible.

Is that started kind of and again the relationship we were friends and then he put his hands on me and he still gets kind of mad and. it's never anything I ever thought I would ever do or anything but there is a lot of controlling in that aspect on his end but it's not constant like because he knows. i'm stern as well and. i'm strong woman and he doesn't want to go without me and it got to where is going on, and then I just was like no. And I may have him was. Last last week. and end up being just like a push back and forth kind of thing and then. But I don't back down i'm a hard head, especially not being on my medicine and drugs it's like I really get angry I don't like you. So I have so much anger built in me from my. marriage and everything else in my childhood it's like man. So, but it's not an all every day thing and um. it's like a it's almost like a nobody deserves it, but I know like I can push and but. I don't know if that's like that's where i'm like man what am I thinking like oh my nice to him, the other day I said when two people are happy and love, they should not be using drugs bottom line. If you're happy, you should be out about wanting to create each other off and showing everybody, you should not be using drugs, and I see this, like every day like and it's like he's not waco more have agreements with me on this like. yeah when you're on drugs it's just like you don't put forth really the relationship at all, so I can tell there's like emotional problems."

I can use about at. Sometimes I was all the time it was about half a gram but now he gave me that so now i'm mad about.
