Would there's a carrot group Monday through Friday, you can pick what day days you want to do it, otherwise talk to the provider when you go to your next appointment okay. um so what i'm only able to do right now the prescription recommendation is only for a four day supply so i'll be able to get a four day script out for you, but it won't be any longer than that, so I would be."

386.0,Provider,No relapse and where is your pain score currently at zero being none at all 10 being the most extreme you can imagine.
7693.0,Patient,By about six. five and a half. I haven't have successful I could barely on a daily the.
386.0,Provider,"So epson salt bath soaking in some warm water with some Epsom salt might help that muscle your muscles and just in general for like in general shakiness and for pain. Definitely drink lots and lots of water to get hydrated a little bit better there really isn't a typical I asked, because you have GI symptoms and so diarrhea is not a typical. Like withdrawal symptom but what you can do is you can become dehydrated if you're just not having any appetite and if everything's going wrong for you."
7693.0,Patient,"They may not. get all the you know, Sam business or anything but like usually I. You know, usually all go like you know five to seven days. Whether now i'll use the bathroom and then five seven days later i'll use it again, but whenever I don't have my medicine, though it's like I have nonstop."
386.0,Provider,"runs right through you. I would definitely look into taking like an over the counter stool softener because you should have a. Daily bowel movement, and I know it's we're talking to me about it, but you should no matter what, so what it sounds like is the suboxone because suboxone has that component in it where it actually. hardens your stool, and so you can you can become constipated from the medication it's called opioid induced constipation. So that is an actual common problem, and so I would recommend taking some type of over the counter stool softener to see if you can have some type of daily bowel movement. And so what it sounds like is that you become so constipated then with without the medication you end up having diarrhea afterwards so. i'm from the backup and so. that's what we like to call constant area i'm here in my household so i'm very common definitely just make sure you're staying hydrated drinking lots of water um any type of. Other symptoms, that you should have ginger is great for nausea if you're having like upset stomach loss of appetite. I recommend having like a box of ginger snaps in your cupboard, just in case. But medications been called in, I spoke to Chris carper, who is the pharmacist over at that kroger pharmacy for you, I did send it in for a prescription order for quantity of eight for you, for four days supply to get you over to Monday on Monday."
7693.0,Patient,"Let me write this down real quick. OK, so my regular group is on Thursdays."
386.0,Provider,"So they have us currently scheduled still on Thursdays and that's with Rochelle and Isaiah Cruz, and that is 12pm Eastern standard. And then, what i'm going to ask for you to do on Monday and what you'll do is you're going to i'm going to give you the meeting ID number two and i'm going to send the care navigators a request to get you scheduled. i'm going to request for you to go to care group it's just a care group it's not with the actual provider, but it's kind of like peer support a little bit and so that's what they're recommending is that you go to so Monday, and that is at 4pm Eastern standard."
