10049.0,Patient,"that's Okay, it happens."
298.0,Provider,So tell me what's been going on.
10049.0,Patient,"Well i've had my yearly exams um and she is sending me he found something in my blood. So they don't know what so I have more blood tests and. Two neurologists to check my brain tumor which i've had it for years and. it's a meningioma, but I have to check it to make sure it's not growing and also to. A heart a cardiologist I have to go to also so i'm scared you know and it's caused me to severe anxiety and. If I haven't been well I got I wasn't feeling well in July and I went to the doctor and I lost I was down to 88 pounds my normal weighs 100 okay. So she was real concerned and my oxygen level was only 8282 so on so she wanted me to go to the emergency room and I hate going to the hospitals and I was fine i've been called in about a week later, my daughter took makes I couldn't breathe, and I was throwing up diarrhea so. They took care of me and I tell my don't do opiate so they just gave me gabba fan, which was do for me to have them and I was fine went home and they gave me i'm oxygen. And so now, I have to go to all these appointments and it's really, really put a lot of. anxiety in my world so i'm really sorry what happened, but they treated me terrible that hospital awful the nurses were terrible. and emergency room was packed with people that actually tested positive for the coven so they were really pissed off, and I was there to begin with, and they gave me a really hard time. They did the colby test on me and the nurse jammed up my nose and I screamed it hurts so bad i'm gonna cry now. and It didn't go in far enough so, then they did it again. And it turned out, I. don't have it so. Anyway, that's what happened and then he the doctor, finally, after I waited two hours came in. and told me to call my doctor they don't know who you are your name I didn't give any information on I just told him that I was in a wonderful program that. I monster box and i've been honest since like February or January, I think I started the program and i'm eternally grateful for it, but be honest if i'm out of gab accountant, and I was taking more i'm not gonna lie because of my anxiety was so bad. That um I tried to not not just let it go and wait until it was do. But I was in such a bad state of mind, you know the anxiety and depression and all that set in. And that's what happens, so thank you for you know take care of it, for me, but um."
298.0,Provider,I had to really reach out and ask what to do in this situation because I. there's so much going on here it's funny.
10049.0,Patient,"I know it scares me too, but i'll be okay it's just a just had a bad last few days and i'm feeling better today, I was up all night again with diarrhea but that's starting to go away um. And so, but thank you for doing that, for me, and I know you were stuck between a rock and a hard spot to you don't know what to do, the only thing I could think of. When I sent you the second email with the shorter thing I put on there, what you could do and i'm not trying to tell you what to do is like instead of 800 milligram changes to 600. milligram and then that would have been a new prescription, it would it wouldn't have been saying I wasn't trying to up it to have you give me more he did, I mean, I think you took it as I."
298.0,Provider,"know I did it. No, the problem lies, is i'm out of FDA. Guidelines. Of what your Max is for the day. And I, so I what it wasn't that I needed a new prescription I got that but I called my boss and said i'm worried here she she didn't get a really good evaluation at what's going on at the hospital, it was a bad experience. And, and they acted like I did the wrong thing, but you. know a higher level of care. At what is going on with you, and so what. I question is, if we are the right people for you like."
10049.0,Patient,"Of course. I wouldn't make it without you guys, are you kidding. You are the only you know my daughter found you guys to St mary's hospital down the Hill, she would she has spent months for me to look for me for suboxone here's the problem with suboxone. Some very she said, out of the whole St mary's hospital only two doctors have a permit to write out scripts for suboxone. So she said she's one started this program on and I got in it and I talked to her person I should look, if this is not going to be for a lifetime. So I needed for lifetime you're wasting my time i'm wasting your she goes no you'll get it for lifetime, because what we found is most of boxing our clinics join it for a week or month and then you're done, you know I mean and then you're on your. own and then you're back in the opiates. Again, and that's I was on suboxone for two years and then what happened my soapbox and doctors medical Group will not accept my medical. So that's why, and then I end up back on the opiates again and I was on everything I was on eight or nine different opiates. you name it, I was on it in all pretty much so I was so grateful to find you guys and. my daughter spent she's an educator so she spent months on my case my daughter was so worried about me on the opiate she was livid she wouldn't go with me the opiate doctor she couldn't stand them, and if you go to his clinic there's 40 to 50 people waiting just to see him for opiates. And that's out there in the parking lot. There in the waiting room they're sitting down there standing up he's he's you know he's really nice to talk to, but. He was I guess used to be in big bear and they couldn't handle all this patient, so you move down the Hill, you know I mean I couldn't believe all the people that was like a cattle feed."
298.0,Provider,So where's your oxygen you're not on it anymore.
10049.0,Patient,"No, no, no, they gave it to me not this time, but if they were terrible."
298.0,Provider,This.
10049.0,Patient,"This time the time before the game reaction when I was there, what a month ago, or something like that. On because she wanted me to go, because my oxygen levels only 82 she said, Linda should be at least in the 90s. And she knew i'd make it through the day and I was fine I didn't go and then about a week later, I had to go, because I couldn't breathe it off so because of my symptoms, when I went. To the er night for last they were all the symptoms of the covert. Is a diarrhea vomiting, and all this now, which I didn't know and they were on me like oh my God yelling at me in the nurses tree me so shabbily. I had and I that Dr to brought back memories, does it that's right took my friend who died, I took me are there, so if you know me so it was just one thing after another, after another, and I today i'm finding filling athlete normal, so the okay to for that was done. But if I don't have if. See the suboxone works and what if I don't have gabba tend to go with it i'm a basket case I mean my mental and anxiety level is so I that I can hardly barely function and it just it does it affects me so bad, the anxiety, so I like I said I can't I can't. Barely function, you know I mean. so bad it's so bad."
298.0,Provider,So thank you for doing.
10049.0,Patient,That for me.
298.0,Provider,"Well, a bit let's talk about moving forward um I was going to and i'm going to recant on what I said I was going to do. Is um I was going to discharge you to a higher level of care, but I hear you have a problem with access to care. Right, I know that I don't like doing this to another adult this just feels like and especially because you're older than me I don't like to eat list, but I want you to kind of. Take what i'm going to say as if you get done with this and you finish it and we're good, then you and I will be good again."
