462.0,Provider,Why is that.
10906.0,Patient,"um last week, I decided to switch farm seeds, because I hate rite aid. And the pharmacy they told me first yeah they could do it, but then they only do their own providers and now trying to get bright her how. to fix it is like pulling teeth. Being boxing you know I asked the pharmacy if they could just transfer, but they can't do that and they didn't tell me for like a few days until I went in there, so it's it's just it's ridiculous I was on hold, like with the pharmacy area for like 20 minutes with bright heart how. I just couldn't wait no more. yeah and I tried again this morning and it's like well they're not open yet it's just i'm getting frustrated."
462.0,Provider,yeah it is frustrating I hear this a lot just from patients trying to switch pharmacies are there pharmacies mess things up and then the communication can be really tough trying to get it all sorted out.
10906.0,Patient,"And then the last it's like you're punished because you had covert to get your medicine, so I was getting only you know for a four days supply or whatever it is just ridiculous. it's like Okay, and then, when I had the appointment with chantel it's like well I got you like for 30 days and blah blah blah but i'm still can't get it, you get the medicine. And just. yellow irritated. Can you hear me yeah I can hear you."
462.0,Provider,"Okay, good just making sure you broke up for a second."
10906.0,Patient,yeah our connections kind of. You can went out there for you froze.
462.0,Provider,yeah so you met with chantel and she sent you in a 30 day script you said.
10906.0,Patient,"yeah she did and I can't get it because I switched pharmacies and then i'm. Trying to choose to go back to write a book, I went to a different right day i'm just going to have to switch insurance companies, because I want to go back to walgreens I mean I don't know it's just the way people are here, but I just don't like lady. flow just. You call the route and that's why I switched but the guy if he did misunderstood me or whatever, but."
462.0,Provider,"yeah it can be hard to switch pharmacies and kind of have to go through all that information at the beginning again so were you able to get it in the end, from the new."
10906.0,Patient,"i'm still working on it, it was like. Honey i've been up I wouldn't lay down yesterday, like at six in the evening because I wasn't feeling good and I woke up at night and i've been up since that. And running around like Okay, I did the walking clinic at the dentist like well why did he come back in at 10 o'clock so it was like one home get a cup of coffee couple bites vote mail back out the door again. And it's just been a day like michaels boss even Mike had a bad day it was like his boss calls oh i'm gonna be here an hour early and someone pick him up besides him and he ends up the guy because I had a wave so Mike waited outside in the cold and I never showed up."
462.0,Provider,And my will.
10906.0,Patient,"You call, unlike like it's your responsibility, but I end up calling and 15 minutes before that I didn't hear my phone on the boss his boss left a message they Lol nevermind Have a nice holiday. I don't need you, you know what the confusion, the guy not picking them up, but I didn't know that at the time, so when I called him i'm like sitting outside for an hour waiting for this guy never showed me his boss and upcoming picking them up. So if I wanted to make a call, he would have walked all over Mike wants and I don't need you, never mind you know blah blah blah and see what i'm telling you about these people here there's oh my God is that is you don't do shit like that."
462.0,Provider,yeah that's really horrible that he was waiting outside and and everything too.
10906.0,Patient,And it's really cold here right now. And my neighbor we won't even go about that discussion i'm so tired of her ship huh.
462.0,Provider,yeah.
10906.0,Patient,"She tried to talk to me and that's like I can't talk right now sorry just can't. Just like a loan shark that's what she was, I mean she acted like I even asked her for damn house that's the part that. pisses me off, and he asked her and she offered it did it, and now you owe me this you owe me for that that added added that and i'm like. that's you don't do shit like that, especially people are sick."
462.0,Provider,mm hmm.
10906.0,Patient,You really don't and I haven't said anything I haven't gone off i'm just trying to avoid it right now it's like.
462.0,Provider,And that's actually that's good that's a good thing to do is just walk away when you. know that you're not capable of having that calm conversation.
10906.0,Patient,"She needs to be told what the hell so she really does and like today, you know she's begging for her money back, and all this, you know from her from the food that she bought the patch she bought me is expensive cough drops which I would have never thought that $8 cough drops hell, no. I mean, and then she wonders why she's broken says the drinking But OK, and then all of a sudden today it's like I bought her another pack of cigarettes, you know to replace what she is bought for me. And she did it out like Oh, it was like no big deal and you shouldn't have done that blah blah blah, but a week ago, I mean she's been a whole total bitch about everything. And then she buys ornaments and I went postal I literally did and I shouldn't have the Michael, but it also pissed me off, she bought us some ornaments you know from a thrift store or whatever. And i'm like I haven't seen anything, yet I want to, because I was like Mike you just take a full of energy back and add it with her shit I mean she's the devil, he is the friggin devil. And he got all upset and everything I understand he's a kid you know he he sees ornaments y'all. because she knows best. yeah what he did was wrong."
462.0,Provider,what's that supposed to be like a peace offering.
10906.0,Patient,"I guess, but she can shove, it up our ass. I swear to God, I mean you just don't do that when people are sick. And she offered and now she wants to prop it up on me."
462.0,Provider,"yeah. yeah no it's. Just inappropriate and you know, like you're just really fed up with life there. In that location."
10906.0,Patient,"what's wrong with people. that's that's what I don't understand what is wrong. Like I told Mike as, I might have heard this isn't God if she's bipolar I know in your professional let's find out things play, but i'm sorry but God damn it."
462.0,Provider,yeah seems very up and down like you said just one day you feel like you could be getting support and assistance from a friend and the next it's like she's kind of pulling the rug out from under you.
10906.0,Patient,"Well, when someone throws receipts down on the bench right there that's why I didn't ask her anymore why didn't ask her the first place, but I was like not gonna let her know nothing so that's why I did quarantine my last week because I had to go get groceries and shit. I wasn't about to have her especially what she was doing and then she's buying me like healthy class diet mountain dew. Most Chief of Staff pads but cough drops sure by the most elaborate. I doesn't have more important, especially my weekend right now."
462.0,Provider,yeah I mean it just doesn't seem like you and her see eye to eye and it's too bad because there has been some somewhat of a friendship there your there's tried to be and it's just not working.
10906.0,Patient,"No i've i've given her so many chances, you know, except. For the way. I really can't say yeah. And I just I can't understand how a person can be like that."
462.0,Provider,"yeah. yeah, how do you think you can move forward from this. Either with or without her, but in some way try to find acceptance and. unavoidable guns."
10906.0,Patient,And this a lot and listen to preach because i'm taking so many damn bad listen to preachers on stuff about this because it's tearing me up so much.
462.0,Provider,mm hmm that's good.
10906.0,Patient,"um cuz I don't know I don't like conflict I got a surprise because we're neighbors and everything and no I mean if I was like this, a true friend I would come up and just tell her straight out what she did this wrong, but I don't feel they would do any good. yeah play the victim, we have enough through the months, she likes to play victim. Like what she said to me well after I had the infusion. Now my thanksgivings messed up, let me have your edt card come on now you don't say she like that I wouldn't say anything like that."
462.0,Provider,yeah so you. recognize there's nothing worth. Discussing or saying to her.
10906.0,Patient,"Exactly I mean she's trying and eventually I probably will give what. i'll never trust her again I ever did anyways right away, I knew there was something there even might know it. But. She. she's more pathetic than I thought. mean to me if I did something wrong somebody or just so stupid like that I would apologize."
462.0,Provider,Right yeah.
10906.0,Patient,Right explain myself why you know.
462.0,Provider,"So then, how do you think you can move forward without having a conversation with her not necessary move forward with her, but just for yourself to not be living in a state of just being so annoyed or affected by it."
10906.0,Patient,"i'm trying to look, you know and was pushing really hard like begin this application on and he says to me up to because i've been so sick and everything it's like nobody understands I need a break here. is just too much on me, I mean I got to bank accounts in the negative I got so much to do, and yes, I do to get this application done but to me he knows my personal information, you can do do it himself."
462.0,Provider,"Right, he."
10906.0,Patient,"wants it done so badly and I understand you only probably disappointed if i'm going to have a place. What that has every day nagging me about it, and he knows that i've been so sick. I mean I fallen twice. I don't know because the Colbert or the diabetes, because it does these dizzy spells to have diabetes, but i'm more leaning to the Kobe. Right me this like right now I gotta go to walgreens smoke a cigarette and andres and my back is killing me too so."
462.0,Provider,yeah.
10906.0,Patient,"I went to even the food pantry that's another. Okay else wants to help me right, and I had with this little message you know, had got the application done yet blah blah blah and i'm like you know explain them several times one my phones will be shut up I did an extent, or three days, but I guess all that problem. And I told them I said I got the food pantry and I don't have to do it because they didn't want me to pick it up cubby stop. you're not supposed to be bending or picking up heavy smoker well I went. Jamie from the school she's on vacation I thought he would offer since it's kind of in his job category there. In it, so I said Fuck it i'll go do it myself, and then I called Michael he was home from work I said just meet me at the bus stop three bags of heavy crap. wonder why my back hurts yeah. So. it's just just a lot right now."
462.0,Provider,"It is no it's it's a lot it's really hard like you said, I wonder why my back hurts, and I just think is there any way to make your life easier, because this is just our."
10906.0,Patient,"link, so my wife, has always been like this. can wait till I get a low if I if we do find a place and everything else, and I get accepted. I mean, I know, one of my neighbors they moved out a year they were supposed to have volunteers help her and none of them showed."
462.0,Provider,that's horrible.
10906.0,Patient,And like if that happens it's just me and Mike and.
462.0,Provider,That is bad for someone with chronic pain.
10906.0,Patient,"I can't afford movers. I can't even afford applications, right now, and that was another thing. With Adam it's like he explained this like he says one thing does another he's like. We were talking about people I went from they have what she told me during inspection she was like arm, we will pay for application fee, but I says, Adam i've asked her have even with this call good thing I asked her for a gift card."
462.0,Provider,Is she was a total.
10906.0,Patient,"bitch and that's why I did it because I knew what upstairs was going to do I know it. And you wish I knew it and I was like okay get a gift card that way he give it to her, and then I don't over a damn thing, but my plans didn't work out like I wanted to August."
462.0,Provider,Right yeah so.
10906.0,Patient,I know Tommy I did.
462.0,Provider,"mm hmm, so it is just hard like you said you've said, your whole. LIFE has been like this, just an uphill battle."
10906.0,Patient,"yeah there's must be something bad about me, I guess, or I did something wrong in my life or. I create my own problems, I don't know."
462.0,Provider,"yeah well that's you know you can question things on a bigger scale, of course, but like I said I just wonder if there's anything to make it easier. I don't know what like you said moving is hard you don't like where you're at but that could bring about stress if you're unable to physically carry your stuff from place to place."
10906.0,Patient,Just i'm a leap of faith that everything will work out like I keep trying is you know they.
462.0,Provider,"yeah and you know, there has been progress, like a lot of the goals that we've talked about you know you said you're taking baths and listening to inspirational stuff for spiritual stuff you were you've been walking and you said you were doing some exercises. So there's a you joined a church, have you been going to church."
10906.0,Patient,yeah we went to one day.
462.0,Provider,Okay that's I mean that is movement.
10906.0,Patient,"yeah. Well, and i'm going to look at it that way, though."
462.0,Provider,yeah.
10906.0,Patient,yeah there's literally he does.
462.0,Provider,What does what does he want to see.
10906.0,Patient,"He wants you to jump for him, like, I even got gutsy and I was like hell i'm not going to answer my phone i'm not going to you know he texted me every morning like when he wants something. Well, when snl with it nope nope nope he's going to get an answer tomorrow."
462.0,Provider,yeah i'm. Just setting boundaries with him to Where are you supposed to be getting a new case manager or whatever his position is.
10906.0,Patient,yeah supposedly he said he was promoted I think he's been demoted. I really do because he realized that what he does. I.
462.0,Provider,can't be the only one too bad yeah.
10906.0,Patient,"But we'll see what happens, maybe the next person will be nicer or better well at night he is amanda say isn't that Nice he needs a little more of a backbone my opinion but. He just I don't know. he's every continent personally we leave a message on my phone is not very confident we talk."
462.0,Provider,"So maybe the next one would be better, it could be good to start fresh with someone new."
10906.0,Patient,"Hopefully, someone has better workout but."
462.0,Provider,Maybe yeah.
10906.0,Patient,"or I get lucky and we get an apartment right away, which has doubtful here because why the places are filled you're on a waiting list, but maybe i'll be in the Program."
462.0,Provider,That could be good yeah it could be good to just have a whole change again is you don't like things right now you're not happy with the people you're in contact with and even where you're living.
10906.0,Patient,over me they have control. I asked someone to answer to. hmm and that's $400 that's not fun.
462.0,Provider,yeah yeah. So you would like more independence.
10906.0,Patient,"Exactly I mean, I have to mind my p's and q's like I feel say that you don't text me and he expects me to answer them right then in there, my phone is not a you know, a leash."
462.0,Provider,"mm hmm true yeah you're allowed to have your own, you have to be on call 24 seven."
10906.0,Patient,"Especially with me I just don't think he understands, with everything that I do work."
462.0,Provider,mm hmm yeah it sounds like you don't feel understood by him and by a lot of the people around you.
10906.0,Patient,"Yes, I mean like with Michael okay I gotta cook dinner clean House you know, trying to save our butts when it comes to financial getting food in this House, I do more than what he realizes I do."
462.0,Provider,mm hmm sure.
10906.0,Patient,it's like he thinks I don't know it's my ass and that's it in. That like I have time I don't honestly I mean. gotta pick my battles. And like she doesn't understand okay like there's a grocery store we go to and I don't know if you ever well i'm city transportation. it's time consuming. Very time consuming so that takes quite a bit of your time off and then time get back home with my health issues i'm tired i'm exhausted. Last yeah do it anymore six o'clock I had to go to bed.
462.0,Provider,"Right yeah I mean it seems like you feel like you have to explain or prove yourself for that you do things right, but that that shouldn't be the case, you know you know, like I said. Things are actually really hard right now, and I wish they could be easier and it sounds like you wish, they could be easier, but you still have to like you know assert that you're productive and doing things."
10906.0,Patient,"And it's like it feels like it's not good enough and with my self esteem and how I feel all the time, I already punished myself, because I don't feel i'm a productive enough, and then, when I got somebody else nagging me and that just makes me feel worse. Right, well, I actually extremely get upset and what eventually will happen it hasn't happened yet for my if it does happen it's only for a few hours, where I get very deep breath they feel like a failure and I don't want to go on anymore."
462.0,Provider,"yeah that's a bad feeling, how do you think you can start to let go of some of these other people's perceptions and like you have to prove."
10906.0,Patient,yourself why meditating now and or doing yoga right into a preacher because. we're i'm second guessing myself and I. shouldn't be doing that.
462.0,Provider,Definitely yeah so you're aware of it right like I just you know set it out and you're aware of it and it's true you don't need to prove yourself to anyone really. And second guessing yourself isn't a good feeling so you're working on that through meditation and listening to preachers and that's a really great way to respond to that actually.
10906.0,Patient,yeah the Why am I not love. The only person that was me is Mike on that.
462.0,Provider,Is love something you're looking for for more people.
10906.0,Patient,"I wish. I really do I mean my grandmother loved me. singing about her life actually if I added the body, because i'm get low on food stamps i'm see i'm my grandma's Greek Orthodox. and It which is January 7 her Christmas would be so i'm gonna make baka baka if I can get the dough."
462.0,Provider,"awesome yeah, I would like to do that. You know."
10906.0,Patient,"that'd be a great honor and. i'm so damn busy, and some sauce the time i'm done doing everything my Christmas trees been here a week and I still can't let the damn lights on, yet. And that was my was my goal yesterday to get it done and time we went to church went to the store went on goodwill mm hmm that was it."
462.0,Provider,yeah no that's I mean that is a lot on a Sunday already so. you're you're tired you're exhausted from everything is there anything you can step back from anything that you don't need to be doing.
10906.0,Patient,I feel like i'm required to do it. I mean actually i'm doing good if I go sit there say how with everything i'm wanting or take a bath.
462.0,Provider,mm hmm yeah that is that's great that you've been doing that that's good thing to step away self care prioritizing your your own needs.
10906.0,Patient,"man like to get my house more Chris it's like i'm wanting to try to enjoy Christmas, even on play ball and i've been doing a lot of that lately, you know, think of Larry my grandma and stuff. like that. But. I don't know it's just like I want to enjoy it, but it seems like there's a lot of people around me that's not letting me. Like let me enjoy holidays, let me do these things, I wanted to do like I was gonna make Christmas cookies because my grandma did. I bought a gingerbread house for me and Michael to do and it's like I don't have no time and I wish I could just this week just focus on Christmas, I know we can't buy presents and stuff like that, but there's other things that we could do."
462.0,Provider,yeah it's it would be a great way to focus on Christmas what's stopping you from focusing on Christmas this week.
10906.0,Patient,"and get this. gets back on. Like the big I call the Bank and they're like okay try to do a personal loan which I haven't had a chance to do that, yet you know just stop it, it seems like. I can't get it accomplished. You know i'll say Okay, we gotta get this done but then they get sidetracked to something else."
462.0,Provider,"yeah so. How can you try to find a balance between the two, making sure you're getting done what absolutely needs to get done but also maybe setting boundaries, whether it be with Adam or letting some things just wait to be accomplished until later date."
10906.0,Patient,"But I can't wait that's the problem. The stuff can't wait yeah that's good, but again. Like I mean I gotta get some sleep before I try to do those applications and all the stupid paperwork, he was like you know, like tana. He can pull this crap up this is what I don't understand about him like what 10 if he wants a printout of what I get. he's got the capabilities of doing that because I signed the document letting him do that i've actually signed it twice, because this is my second year on the program D, this is what i'm talking the bullshit equals. One minute he can get this stuff but now he wants me to do this, then he wants me to write a letter y added addictions and stopped up getting the apartment."
462.0,Provider,"So it's feels like he saved it for the last minute, is that."
10906.0,Patient,"idea, but he didn't fucking do anything like when we're going through call with this shit now all of a sudden now yeah. We gotta jump okay."
462.0,Provider,yeah that's frustrating.
10906.0,Patient,"or when I asked for something to be done, it takes them two to three months before it's done."
462.0,Provider,yeah.
10906.0,Patient,And then he is best me to comply with his by. mean i'm not rude to them don't don't think i'm not because i'm not. i'm very.
462.0,Provider,"Like a very frustrating, you know situation. What are just a couple Christmas things that you think you can try to prioritize this week to lift your mood and be the spirit."
10906.0,Patient,"i'm hoping, at least, maybe tomorrow, I can get my lifetime tree."
462.0,Provider,That would be a good start.
10906.0,Patient,It would be nice.
462.0,Provider,"mm hmm. Okay, so that could be a good goal is tomorrow evening or what what time of the day, do you think would be best for you to get the lights on."
10906.0,Patient,it's probably going to be in the evening.
462.0,Provider,"Most like so tomorrow, your name. You get the lights on."
10906.0,Patient,And I still need to go the grocery store before we run out of food stamps so I need to get the silo Joe. there's a few other things like so I can make Chris I can't even find cookie cutters here.
462.0,Provider,Really that's weird even at the like dollar tree or something like that.
10906.0,Patient,"that's What I want, and I."
462.0,Provider,usually have tiger lily morrow didn't have any either i'm like.
10906.0,Patient,"in store, but no me."
462.0,Provider,So you'll be cutting out your own shape.
10906.0,Patient,I guess well.
462.0,Provider,"yeah well, you can try to get the lights on, try to do cookies that will at least you know put you doing something you enjoy celebrating the holidays like you said, maybe making ballclub on the Greek Orthodox Christmas and. Trying to just feel you know connected and doing something for you, rather than like tomorrow if the in the evening Adams messaging you maybe it would be a good time to just exercise putting your phone across the room and just doing your Christmas tree."
10906.0,Patient,yeah cuz even like this morning it was like okay we're gonna do some yoga and i've been doing a little bit at night to try to.
462.0,Provider,do good.
10906.0,Patient,"paid. going through, and when I wake up in the morning, I can barely walk right now. And that's another thing my appetite about i'm dropping weight fast."
462.0,Provider,i'm from coven.
10906.0,Patient,don't have no appetite.
462.0,Provider,You know.
10906.0,Patient,"The doctors don't give a shit so I mean that was another thing I had a doctor's appointment because i'm still getting sore throats occasionally. mentioned about me following you know and the doctor that called and said that you really don't need to be coming to see me anymore you're done with all that, yes, your lab problems. Your your doctor can handle it and i'm like Okay, this is getting kind of ridiculous because my calls and make the appointment. They pushed me off on to you and I don't feel that either I should be sooner, because you really you know doesn't do much anyway here's some cough syrup and then you gotta beg for that, on your way."
462.0,Provider,yeah.
10906.0,Patient,That thought made me feel really good I mean I was ready to go out the door is she caught. Right work before I was walking out the door you don't need to come and see me make an appointment with your doctor your primary. I know you don't believe me how bad.
462.0,Provider,"Oh, I know I don't believe you I hear it all the time, you know people have so many issues with the health care and. it's just like I said you're in this sort of whole environment where things just aren't working and you're just not happy with the people around you and the place that you're at."
10906.0,Patient,I want to ask a question people originally from you i'm sure you deal with Washington people they complain about the place as much as I do.
462.0,Provider,Washington people I don't think so as much no.
10906.0,Patient,I must got a problem then.
462.0,Provider,"people that are from there wouldn't be thinking probably. Nobody, you know right exactly."
10906.0,Patient,"That could be it and I moved around a lot, and this has been the hardest place ever."
462.0,Provider,"yeah you've had a tough time there and it's that's why I said, maybe it's time I know that moving is hard, but to consider something different."
10906.0,Patient,"yeah in time, I mean either get a job or my given job, while he's working right now. he's working he's only working one day a week so that's it and today was his last day until the 20th of next marks."
462.0,Provider,So the whole month.
10906.0,Patient,yeah the guys going on vacation again okay. Well we'll figure it out.
462.0,Provider,"yeah so you can think about what change, you might want or be ready for what's feasible for you as far as like you said if it's working working part time moving to a different place going back to Florida, who knows right."
10906.0,Patient,"True i'm not going back to Florida, though I highly doubt that because I wanted a poem once again. I don't I mean me and why even talking a lot to lately so see that sometimes makes me wonder to maybe I just thought, maybe something was trying to tell me to go back to Michigan you like to go."
462.0,Provider,yeah well. What do you think is trying to tell you that.
10906.0,Patient,"I get along better, but I get along with for two people I get along with Texas people so that i'm not gonna spend that fair for me to say that I don't know, maybe. Maybe I find happiness again. I mean, I wanted to move back at one time before my mom and grandma passed away and Larry didn't want to do it, so that wasn't too happy with him on that. I wanted to spend time with them and so maybe it's a part of me that misses home a little bit. That maybe that's why, after all, and just you know running away from it, or something I don't know."
462.0,Provider,Maybe that's something to reflect on a little bit about if you feel like you're being drawn towards home original home.
10906.0,Patient,"yeah original. I don't know it's just I don't know where we would fit I mean I thought about taxes we thought about New Jersey, because Michael. Has kind of. done that Michael really want to live here anymore either what goes on he's. Socially a mom or but. You know we'll figure it out it's just i'm not going to Joel either."
462.0,Provider,it's yeah it's important to have things planned out like you said you don't want to go just run back to Florida and be homeless. So it is important to figure it out part of that is just doing some reflection and seeing what you feel and seeing what your instincts are telling you.
10906.0,Patient,"Well, probably when I would do you know I won't do like we did here because we were living in a hotel in Florida before we came here I if I could possibly do. It, I would like to go and I did this before. We moved to Texas, you know I lived in Texas, but Larry had not and you see how it feels you know how something will call out to you. know just it does, and I would want to go for a week and see how I feel it."
462.0,Provider,yeah let's. To. To get a little taste.
10906.0,Patient,Not just places call out to you i'm kind of like impact really you know it soon with my surroundings. mm hmm well I feel comfortable with.
462.0,Provider,"yeah and that's a good thing to tap into is tap into your your intuition and what you're what you're kind of being told, and where you're being guided and what you're feeling in your body, what makes you feel comfortable or uncomfortable you know."
10906.0,Patient,and looking for those answers kind of like listening to God right now.
462.0,Provider,Right yeah.
10906.0,Patient,"I shut them out for the longest time because i'm being angry. No all tissues, the abuse. out and it lately, I would say in the past couple weeks my heart's been a little more open and i'm hearing thing more."
462.0,Provider,"yeah that's good, what do you think helped open your heart, a little bit."
10906.0,Patient,"Honestly, I he and Leo and say this but coven. i'm being as sick, as I was still around and made me shut the shut down a little bit."
462.0,Provider,mm hmm.
10906.0,Patient,"Like sitting in that bathtub what else you're going to do, but think."
462.0,Provider,"True, so it made you stop."
10906.0,Patient,It.
462.0,Provider,"forced you to have that time that we talked about where you just have to. step away and take that time for yourself, so it kind of force that on you and, within that it had you get a little bit more in touch with yourself and open your heart again to your religion and God."
10906.0,Patient,yeah and even my health as far as my eating. What i'm drinking i'm drinking a lot of tea and more on the healthier side i'm like jeez stuff like that so. Jackie my sugars.
462.0,Provider,"Okay So how do you think as you'll eventually recover from Kobe, and all this, how do you think you can keep that going right getting that time to be in touch with yourself but not having to be forced into it by being very, very sick."
10906.0,Patient,Just a reminder thinking back on how I was I guess.
462.0,Provider,yeah reminding yourself.
10906.0,Patient,"You know you never want to cause you that's why people don't like change because they don't want to go through the pain of it. Like I need to think about that you know. How miserable. i'm still sick but uh i'm moving. My thought process a little bit bad or not so negative. And that's something I still need to work on. But we all complain, I mean we all do it."
462.0,Provider,"yeah so you're feeling a little bit more connected little bit more positive. it's important to just note this and, like I said. know how you can keep going in that direction versus just falling back into before you had co bit and we're more disconnected."
10906.0,Patient,And i'm seeing that i'm able to stand up for. Which that's a big accomplishment for me.
462.0,Provider,You mean like physically stand up.
10906.0,Patient,well.
462.0,Provider,mentally and up for your life.
10906.0,Patient,Okay yeah like with. Chris to you know I don't have to answer to her because that's another issue and i'm already ready for it. You know she has this tendency to be a busy body and damn business.
462.0,Provider,mm hmm yeah that's great standing up for yourself setting boundaries advocating for your needs.
10906.0,Patient,"yeah just like this preacher I was just listening to that will take anything when we're when we're down. Just for better, even if it's bad. Sure, and I think that's also what had happened."
462.0,Provider,mm hmm. yeah so.
10906.0,Patient,i'm seeing things differently that's.
462.0,Provider,"See though yeah that's a good thing, how can you do you ever journal or write these things down right these thoughts stone."
10906.0,Patient,"I bought a notebook was we were talking about the last time we talked before that. I did buy one, and she wanted the dollar store by haven't rolled into it, yet know what i've been doing when I have time if, like a Bible verse stands out to me if I get like emails and stuff of verse of the day and stuff like that and it's something stands out to me i'll write it now."
462.0,Provider,Okay. that's all right. that's a good start.
10906.0,Patient,"To me, you know."
462.0,Provider,"mm hmm yeah so key I would say, keep doing that keep writing down the Bible verses that stand out to maybe after we hang up you write down just some thoughts on your chain your change thought process and you're. Being a little bit more open and connected, just as a reminder even put the date, you know."
10906.0,Patient,"Like when I got baptized and repent for my sins. And you know I don't remember the day, by the way. Really, no. Oh, am I got baptized like way before we moved here. mm hmm oh no I forgot the date."
462.0,Provider,yeah well it's it's always helpful to have the date just to remember like okay that's where I was in this timeframe and here's where I am now right or what can I take from that time frame again and bring with me no.
10906.0,Patient,"No. Oh, my gosh she's now she's texting me what are michaels favorite cookies."
462.0,Provider,Is that your neighbor is that your.
10906.0,Patient,case there.
462.0,Provider,yeah interesting okay.
10906.0,Patient,No she is he's rapping and she heard me bitching about her i'm telling you.
462.0,Provider,it's uncomfortable.
10906.0,Patient,Oh. What are your. notes.
462.0,Provider,"yeah that's confusing. Again, just the niceness and then asking for payment and then doing a nice favor and then asking for payment that's. confusing for you."
10906.0,Patient,"i'm just laughing about it that's, all I can do."
462.0,Provider,yeah. it's sometimes it is.
10906.0,Patient,i'm not responding because I gotta go after we're done i'm going to walgreens so I don't have time to respond right now.
462.0,Provider,"Good that's a good boundary right that's sometimes again we've talked about boundaries and you just taking that time for yourself, you don't have to respond right now that's not it's not urgent, you can respond when you have time."
10906.0,Patient,"You know and that's another thing i've always feel like okay gotta hurry up and do it right, then in there, you know and now it's about that."
462.0,Provider,Right. you're seeing things a little differently moving forward some of the goals that we've talked about you're starting to accomplish them like you know getting a church listening to the sermons doing. meditation yoga baths What would you say are your current goals for the next month or so.
10906.0,Patient,"A month or once they go to school, but that's pretty far fetched."
462.0,Provider,"That could be a maybe more of a middle term goal, not one month, but couple months we can."
10906.0,Patient,"We can put that as a couple now if I was allowed to school in January. i'm gonna say get a part time job. And you know all of my attorney I haven't even got Ahold of him, yet."
462.0,Provider,"Okay, so work on getting a part time job and getting a hold of your attorney, what do you need help with your attorney."
10906.0,Patient,On a song security because we're at the last all right now look. As far as scheduling the Court date and all that. And they told me that you know there were no rush as far as the paperwork goes until I got better from coven and you know why that is that's because we want to see what's going to happen to you after the call the situation.
462.0,Provider,Right okay so good get Ahold of attorney looking for and getting a part time job that's some good goals and then I would just say carrying on with some of the self care that you're doing that's that's.
10906.0,Patient,"My problem is it I hate given answers like that. Because in my life. Nothing gets accomplished that I want to get done and then, when I feel like my tell you what I want. you're going to have happen. Like that sabotage feeling."
462.0,Provider,Oh OK so there's like some some self sabotage happening.
10906.0,Patient,yeah exactly and I don't like when people down either.
462.0,Provider,Well you're not letting me down it's your own personal goals So how do you think you can avoid the self sabotage.
10906.0,Patient,Oh no I can't answer that one I don't know.
462.0,Provider,And again just kind of going back it's almost like you feel like you have to.
10906.0,Patient,"mail it goes right. And, but I guess I gotta say. Well it's like I smell yeah obviously like today it's like hell with everybody that i'll just go the food pantry and myself, and do it myself. Okay, but. It does that I don't every day is not waste that for me were being strong and say Okay, you get what i'm saying."
462.0,Provider,yeah yeah every day can't be.
10906.0,Patient,And then I feel like yes i'm ready I don't know when you tell somebody you're good okay i'm one of these people when I say i'm going to do something I do it. And that's what I mean by letting down I don't like to say something and then it doesn't have.
462.0,Provider,"To well rather than getting a job, maybe it's just that you start researching looking into some about making one application."
10906.0,Patient,that's a good goal like I was actually thinking on this is like at least get one application of the job one application of an apartment.
462.0,Provider,There you go okay there we go that sounds really realistic and like there's it's more specific to so one application for a job one application for an apartment that sounds reasonable and helpful for you and attorney.
10906.0,Patient,"Yes, and putting time in to be looking like you said you know same thing with the apartment like I don't know let's just say half hour to an hour to work on it."
462.0,Provider,yeah perfect that's it.
10906.0,Patient,And going on with my hectic life sorry. I have a mode to get to the battery to apply for loans and you know stuff like that.
462.0,Provider,mm hmm yeah.
10906.0,Patient,"He calls. His I mean one day I cooked like twice, I have a rule of thumb I always told my family, I only cook once a day and my."
462.0,Provider,"role, I like that."
10906.0,Patient,"You got breakfast and he got dinner and it's like oh my God and again we have to work, so it was like okay that took up all three hours of my day. And Adam says, I don't y'all he makes me feel like I don't do a damn thing."
462.0,Provider,yeah okay well and you do let's also try to step away from that again have that feeling like you need to prove yourself or worrying about other people's judgments.
10906.0,Patient,Okay yeah that is one of my big problems. That I worry about what people think.
462.0,Provider,So that could be something to just notice and start to observe and try to step away from that when you feel it coming up.
10906.0,Patient,"Okay, good."
462.0,Provider,Okay there's a little bit of a plan there how about we schedule you for January.
10906.0,Patient,"it's just like I hate that questions when they ask you, what is your life, going to be in five. what's done."
462.0,Provider,that's a big question.
10906.0,Patient,Ah.
462.0,Provider,that's a very big question to expect someone to answer yeah.
10906.0,Patient,But you know they do that a lot like in jobs and.
462.0,Provider,"job interviews yeah. let's see. So if you want to stick with Monday we could do the 10 unless you want to do the week before that, on a different day it's up to you."
10906.0,Patient,yeah when we go sooner.
462.0,Provider,"in Christ so then maybe a. Tuesday, Wednesday or Thursday fourth, fifth sixth."
10906.0,Patient,"I got appointments going on. And i'm not for sure what they are. crap and maybe. Sure we're going to have to because I don't want to make you wait and what I did, I know I got. A dentist appointment. And there was something else to going on all the inker knowledge is and I can't remember what day it was, but I know it's in the beginning of the month."
462.0,Provider,"Okay, do you want to push it out to the 10th or do you want to try to schedule later when you know."
10906.0,Patient,"When we do the 10th. Okay, I know i'm sure if not on the time it sound like it's on the time."
462.0,Provider,"Okay, and we can do this same time so 5pm on the 10th."
10906.0,Patient,"yeah see that might work because that way, I know I don't have no appointments you know, maybe. are doing in the evenings like this."
462.0,Provider,yeah we can do that for the 10th that'll help. And then you're in for that and we can schedule you again on the 10th or do you want to do a second appointment now.
10906.0,Patient,You can do a second one. And then I have you. listed down.
462.0,Provider,So the.
10906.0,Patient,"About about that too, I need to work on that remembering appointments. I know about them like during that week, but I just. can't remember the precise date I haven't yeah for that and I double booked yet i'm bad at scheduling."
462.0,Provider,yeah it's hard you've got a lot of appointments to which makes it tough. So the 10th and then maybe the 24th or the 31st.
10906.0,Patient,Either are.
