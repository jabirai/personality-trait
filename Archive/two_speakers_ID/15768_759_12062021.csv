759.0,Provider,"yeah. I like that area too, I like that city a lot."
15768.0,Patient,"I totally I love this city, but. I definitely like living in a small town more and then it's nice to be able to go and like have San Francisco be there and have like portland Oregon be not too far away because visiting is nice for me, but living there, not so much in my opinion."
759.0,Provider,yeah How far is portland from you.
15768.0,Patient,"I think it's like three hours, maybe."
759.0,Provider,that's not bad.
15768.0,Patient,"not bad yeah we're kind of smack DAB I guess in the middle, because it's five a five hour drive to. San Francisco so."
759.0,Provider,uh huh yeah yeah.
15768.0,Patient,"But i'm excited i'm going to go and visit my family down there over for a week over Christmas so. it's been a while, since i've been down there so."
759.0,Provider,"Nice yeah let me get the visitor folks. Okay. So I like to discuss like your treatment plan as far as what G hope to gain from our therapy, I think we talked about a little bit last time, but I just want to get kind of like. You know, this is why I hope to gain maybe a new perspective, maybe learning more about myself so i'm going to ask you, what do you hope to gain from there."
15768.0,Patient,"Well, I would say what you said to definitely learning more about myself, just like i'm grew up like growing more the. You know from from learning more about myself and kind of like I guess learning how to best to work with myself."
759.0,Provider,Okay.
15768.0,Patient,"um and also something that I really hope to gain like something that. I like wanted to begin coming to this for was just like gaining more confidence. yeah, particularly in like social situations. But just overall in general. I feel confident when i'm by myself, but then when i'm around others I I definitely noticed that I have like a lack of confidence so. I would like to see that improve and just like to feel more comfortable in my own body."
759.0,Provider,"Okay, feel more comfortable in your own body okay. that's something we can definitely work on together. Sorry i'm just writing down information if you see me over that's just me just writing down falling down some notes. yeah so you feel confident you know when you're by yourself and it's been talked about confidence for a minute and, but when you're with other people kind of you know, goes down a little bit, why do you think that."
15768.0,Patient,"i'm. I think. Possibly it's related to not feeling entirely comfortable with myself. um. i've tried to think about it before and I think that that is one of the best answers that I can give. Just because I would imagine, at least if I did feel completely comfortable with myself that I wouldn't be affected by. lack of confidence around other people, you know. At least that's how I think about it, I would imagine, I guess, if I would feel like 100% Okay, and like good with me that I wouldn't have any like. I wouldn't feel like defensive when talking with other people or get triggered by certain situations. Because I feel like I would just be good. You know so. That wouldn't affect me but I noticed like at this point it isn't really like that, like I do I do feel comfortable in some situations, but I noticed it takes me a while to like warm up, and I would like, for me, for like I would like to just feel comfortable. Wherever I am you know, and I don't know if that's like asking too much or expecting too much, but I don't really think it is, I think the that that's how I would prefer to kind of go through life, you know."
759.0,Provider,"yeah comfortable in your own skin, you know about you know who you are, as a person, and you know feeling comfortable with everything you know that you have one through put it in perspective for yourself, I see that. You know, but in times. You know it's, not to say that. We don't have self worth our kind of fight good self, esteem, but just being able to have better self esteem, you know and about you know, like how we feel about ourselves. You know, and I feel like if you feel better about yourself, the more comfortable you're going to feel around other people if you have a good sense of self."
15768.0,Patient,Definitely yeah yeah.
759.0,Provider,So good sense of smell.
15768.0,Patient,"yeah and I think also something that kind of. Like a feeling I just that, as is, I am not totally comfortable with is like i'm like a sense of like being threatened by like, for example, I don't agree with this, but I noticed that the feelings come up so like, for example, if there's like another really beautiful woman in the room. And I recognize that a part of me feels not entirely comfortable and like maybe slightly threatened by that you know and then that makes me feel you know a little bit uneasy. And like. I don't always feel that way, because I can definitely appreciate like another woman's like beauty and like honor and respect that and not feel like it makes me any less of a woman, you know. When there are just certain things like that I feel like like competitive or like some kind of competition or feeling like less than in some kind of way that sort of comes up for me and. I would just like that to not be so you know, but I think that that's something that a lot of people experience that. You know I don't feel so alone in that feeling, but it is something that I want to like work through so that. You know I can just kind of realize that. Like. Every like I know everybody's equal but, just like really kind of feeling exactly how you were saying just like totally comfortable so that I can not worry about anything like that you know."
759.0,Provider,"yeah you can appreciate the woman's beauty, but you can also appreciate your own V."
15768.0,Patient,"You know, not your. yeah and not feel uncomfortable. Or you know what I mean or jealous say is like my partner or somebody that i'm seeing is also there like you know cuz I just I feel like that's so unnecessary. to feel that way. If there's like trust and stuff and in in your situation ships or whatever. You like he. That yeah I just noticed that it comes up and that has been an issue in some of my other relationships before and I just want it to like feel better you know."
759.0,Provider,"You I feel better okay. yeah I think that goes, but to kind of you know, like philly secured baby. feeling. About yourself."
15768.0,Patient,yeah totally.
759.0,Provider,"yeah. Is there anything in your pass that can be related I hate to be one of those therapists that goes into your past, but sometimes. Sometimes there's stuff from our past make us, you know, like who we are today experiences that we have had in the past, you know any time that you felt unseen before or not appreciate it."
15768.0,Patient,"yeah. yeah actually that's like a you said unseen. And that's something that i've. felt for kind of like my whole life, even with my family my parents like I love my parents and I have an amazing and really supportive family."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
15768.0,Patient,"But I didn't really ever feel seen really seen by my parents in particular. You know I obviously they they thought they think the world of me, and they love me dearly and i'm really grateful to have that. Because they're amazing and they had a really great childhood, you know they spent a lot of time with me and I don't have any. Any history of you know abuse or anything like that I had a really loving family but yeah I definitely didn't I feel like I was a very and still am, but was a very like sensitive like child. And I yeah I feel like I was never and i've and i've noticed that now, in my adult life can thinking back on that, I guess, I never really did feel fully seen by my mom and my dad in ways some ways, yes, but in a lot of ways that are really important to me, I don't feel like I was to you."
759.0,Provider,"Okay, so not fully saying."
15768.0,Patient,"yeah and not only that like. Like by many people and that's actually kind of like a big thing in my life is like I don't know like why that is, or if, like. I wasn't letting people in and that's the reason why or or something like that, but I noticed that, like but, most people in my life and in my life growing up, and especially in high school and just kind of the in my young adult life to like with lovers and stuff like that. Like you, like I would think that with like my lover or my partner that that would be the person who can really see me like see me for everything that I am the good and the bad and everything and like accept me, you know and make me feel like welcome. But I feel like in my earlier relationships in life, like. I was seeking that but I, and I would have in you know, like really nice feelings for people and want to be with them, but even those people didn't really see me or appreciate me for that matter. Up until I think my last relationship that I was in was one I felt like truly truly seeing. And I I feel like that's thus far, like maybe the only relationship that I feel like i've been truly seen in, and that includes friendships also. Although like don't get me wrong i've had great friendships to like really good times with people but yeah like never really felt like I could fully be like myself and be seen for that. mm hmm that makes sense."
759.0,Provider,"yeah that does make sense. yeah yeah i'm or break it down a little bit this philly and i've been unseen what parts of you did think people don't fully see. Should I give you an example. For that hell okay like sometimes people don't me me might not know this like say like your intelligence. Or, and you know, the fact that maybe you're going through like an emotion are that you're you know, like a giver just something some kind of aspect about yourself that people don't really give. A you don't feel like they see how about you, you know it could be an aspect, it can be a thing that we do are maybe notice you in a certain type of way does that make sense."
15768.0,Patient,"yeah that makes sense, so I would say intelligence is one for sure I feel like I had a lot of potential like and I am I do think of myself as a bright person, you know. And I don't feel like that was kind of. I remember in school as a kid being encouraged in that sort of way but. I don't know it felt like maybe not in the ways that I needed or maybe I just didn't take enough initiative on my own. i'm not really sure. But I guess more so what I mean like by scene is like my I don't know if. This is like just my own perspective that, like my like so like you know, like who I really am like. which involves my intellect. And my heart. yeah."
759.0,Provider,"You know yeah Okay, but your heart okay."
15768.0,Patient,Like I feel like. yeah and I don't know if that's like like I feel like maybe a reason for that is like not meeting people who are as sensitive as I am or something like that.
759.0,Provider,Okay.
15768.0,Patient,yeah and.
759.0,Provider,You did mention your sensitive child yeah.
15768.0,Patient,"yeah and so maybe like people I didn't feel like I was able to kind of relate to people on that sort of level, so I didn't feel seeing like I definitely. yeah. I was like living in a world. with people who didn't feel as deeply as me for a long time. mm hmm and not to say that, like i'm any higher anything like that than anybody else I don't think that at all, but. It just see I kind of. did feel like for a long time that I felt things really deeply and like it didn't seem like I could relate to anybody around me in that same way."
759.0,Provider,"yeah like being a highly sensitive person, you know you do people like that tend to feel things more deeply to experience life on a different plane so, so to say, like you. You know experience you pick up on other people's emotions you feel feelings in a different way you're very empathetic compassionate. You know, towards other people suffering and sometimes you have to watch out too, because sometimes it's two people put other people's needs ahead of their own."
15768.0,Patient,You know and i've been very taken advantage of.
759.0,Provider,yeah.
15768.0,Patient,"And I feel like that sensitivity was like it's a strength, but I felt like it was almost a weakness, for me, for a long time because. I would allow people to take advantage of me."
759.0,Provider,So that's something else to talk about.
15768.0,Patient,"Well yeah I guess it just felt like I wasn't. Like. Like it was more difficult for me to be very assertive you know what I mean and like stand up for myself so. I would just kind of want to always give and make people feel good, and in turn it kind of didn't make me feel good. And then I think that may be that sort of. Put like a damper or something on my own self like worse."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
15768.0,Patient,I don't know if that makes sense yeah.
759.0,Provider,"That makes total sense you're making total sense. yeah yeah. yeah yeah like gun, you know I appreciate you being open, you know the talking about this, because I do think it's it's time spout to be unseen to a lot of different areas, you know, this being sensitive being. Like. Having your heart open to people and people not seeing you know your heart not seeing your true self. You know people taking advantage of. You you know not how like a good sense of self worth you know it ties back to a lot of different things, a lot of different areas and themes, you know as we get to kind of like unravel weddings to be unseen will pick up on more and kind of like central themes okay. Okay yeah. So you mention, you know not being assertive enough, you know, like with in terms of other people not feeling secure about yourself secured about yourself yeah like. I said all that stuff kind of like inner relates to each other. And you mentioned before about feeling, you know, sometimes that driven by you know by other people, but not in the sense that you feel as though. you're better than you is are there, you know, like are you better than then it's, just like in comparison of a little bit you know about who you are."
15768.0,Patient,yeah just feeling like like. feeling like I couldn't relate to anyone.
759.0,Provider,relate to the new one okay.
15768.0,Patient,"Like not even trying to I guess that is sort of a comparison, but yeah just not feeling like. yeah like I can't express the way that I feel to somebody else and them to actually like get me."
759.0,Provider,"yeah. All right, that is a lot. Where is the best way that we can kind of tackle this a little bit. lot of different things. let's go back to you know what you do you know want people to see mentioned into liking your heart, and you know there's some sometimes things that people kind of miss about you, is there anything else that people miss about you."
15768.0,Patient,"That I mean I think that's Maybe my best way of explaining it or just like my my depth, is what I feel like I, but I feel like it's because I don't. Like I know that I have expressed it, but I feel like i'm maybe i'm struggling at the moment, to be able to actually express. myself to with other people."
759.0,Provider,Okay.
15768.0,Patient,"yeah, especially now that i'm kind of living in a new town where I noticed that. There are more people it there seems to be more people who are similar to me but i'm having a difficult time, like making like or connecting with people at the moment. um, and so I think that definitely has something to do to do with me, because I feel right now in social situations like not very comfortable I feel like. Like I need to get myself grounded, so that I can feel like what's going on in mind body and not be so. up in the like or not be so all over the place, when other people around you know, like be able to kind of focus on what i'm feeling and what i'm thinking and not what anybody else says, you know."
759.0,Provider,What what other people okay so be express yourself connect better with people and goes back to that feeling of feeling just uncomfortable around that people.
15768.0,Patient,yeah and I think I guess it could all tie tie into what we were talking about of just like feeling not totally stable or like not totally secure. Within yourself.
759.0,Provider,"Okay, all goes back to I think to my not feeling like we talked about you feeling the beginning uncomfortable you know that sense of you know, not being able to. feel confident that's what we were talking about your confidence, you know, and so it goes back, I think all these things go back to that you know just feeling comfortable in your own skin, the low bed. And not feeling totally stable or secure in yourself let's talk about. And we talked about the past kind of a little bit with your parents being highly sensitive, and you know not having on. Not being able to kind of fight the fleecing relate to other people. i'm trying to think of the best way to tackle this. Sure, like, I will live for you to do some. Some work, and this could be outside of therapy just kind of like working on your self esteem, a little bit. i'm trying to think of good journal prompts. hold on just one moment sure. Give me one moment just to look at this, I think this would be really good for ego so journal prompt. something to help me discover yourself. A little bit more. i'm promise is going to be good i'm just trying to figure out one. problem, and I want you to write this down."
15768.0,Patient,we're gonna pen.
759.0,Provider,"Live i'm just going to start with simple ones for you, you know, like Why do I love myself. What do I appreciate. about my body, what about my body, do I appreciate. What is my best trait. For myself. And what is happiness. For me. And I want you to do because I want you to do some inner work by just discovering things about yourself, you know, and I think that might help. Those those journal prompts makes sense, a little. bit well we're start there. Okay, good good because I want you to discover things about yourself and that's what therapy is about because, like we said, like growing more. And just learning more about yourself I didn't find what your needs are because I think it all goes it points back to. Maybe a central need you know, to get you to have a better sense of self you know, like what what is about me, you know that I want people to see you know if I want people to see my heart. You know, like how do I express myself, because I see what you're saying you know, like a little bit. How do I get people to know this, who I am and what I bring to the table, and it goes back to kind of like. feeling comfortable enough to share that with other people to share that with people in our lives, typically but we first have to be comfortable with who we are, before we can be comfortable around other people that's that's another piece to the story too. yeah. Okay, good, and you can always say Nada I don't get this like i'm pretty open like if he you know disagree with anything, be like that's not what it is. You can always tell me i'm not you know, like oh i'm totally open."
15768.0,Patient,It okay cool.
759.0,Provider,yeah. You can always disagree. And just feel like Nada that's not what it is.
15768.0,Patient,Okay.
759.0,Provider,"feel free. Okay yeah I feel I hope you feel comfortable with the space that we have together and that you can fully fully like open up and be, you know as on this, you know as she can be yeah. Because you know, like therapy, you know, like it's it's a place where you're you're growing like you're learning or challenging yourself a little bit you know, so I wanted to be a good space for you right yeah. yeah how's good therapy been going for you are you getting something out good therapy."
15768.0,Patient,"hmm. OK. OK, I definitely think that like what the um I guess them guide or the therapist that's in the leader of the group, what the points that she brings up in the topics that she brings up. In the session I do find important and useful. But it's difficult kind of because we're in session for an hour and it sort of feels a little bit like all we have time to do is go around and talk about how our day was in mentioned something about a question that she's asked the solver kind of. comment on. And it sort of feels like by the time we're all done going around and doing that the session is almost over. And so. I don't expect to get like a lot of attention in that because there's so many people in it, and you know I don't know if that's exactly the point of the group, but it's going Okay, I feel like i'm getting something out of it yeah. Okay, not that much right now but i've only been into groups also so."
759.0,Provider,"Okay yeah it's a quick, you know it's not typical and sometimes the groups are big, so the dare P work it's kind of like yeah you only have a segment to choose, so that their pets can teach you something and then you do the quote the check ins and that's pretty much group. yeah give it. Some time scripts can be big was 12 or more people, but if it's like a smaller group you but to dive more into like to Derek P piece, you know which is like gaining more information about each person and. Being a read about them and yeah yeah so I."
15768.0,Patient,"Did it yeah it is helpful to hear other people like about other people's struggles, although I just like make me feel like. That I hurt hurt for them a little bit in there. There, because some of them seemed like they had real pain that they're trying to work through you know, so I like feel feel for them and makes me feel sort of sad sometimes but. At the same time it's it's helpful to at least be able to hear that other people go through like real struggles and like makes you feel like I guess you're not so alone in your own."
759.0,Provider,"yeah yeah and that's a good point to make, to what good therapy it's all about yeah. it's more so, like a support group more than therapy, I would say that. Okay yeah like a little bit more like a support like the groups here more support driven than therapy kind of like event does that make."
15768.0,Patient,sense yeah that makes sense.
759.0,Provider,"yeah yeah. which could change by with the nature of the group it's kind of like you only get so much time and then Time runs out and but yeah just take it out of sight as think of support like if you ever need extra support you know you have a dare. yeah yeah. So let's talk about, we still have about. About 20 more minutes so. let's dive into kind of cover what we talked about so far. My actually some kind of basic question is. Do you love yourself."
15768.0,Patient,Yes.
759.0,Provider,"Okay, yes okay."
15768.0,Patient,"There are some decisions that i've made. that make it difficult to do that. Sometimes, though. To be honest. But I totally love myself like, but I think forgiveness is like a big. Part of that, and there have been some things that have kind of happened in my life in ways that i've behaved that now miss kind of happened when I was younger in like the teenage years. That I just like they totally don't align with who I am and so. That I feel like is maybe the thing that gets in the way of me like being able to fully accept myself, because I think that i'm maybe haven't entirely worked through like that kind of forgiveness process and, like resolve around things that have happened. In the past, or the ways that i've treated some people in the past."
759.0,Provider,"You have treated some people in the past. I have another journal prompt for you that just reminded me about forgiveness write about your take on forgiveness, you know, right up in yeah you can just put down what is my take on forgiveness and just forgiving yourself. yeah. And if you don't are we have like you get journal you get notebook or journal that looks like that, or you know, whatever works for you. Like being kind of like generally it's the best way to kind of like express yourself, one of the best ways to do that, you know, besides, you know therapy, of course, are talking with a trusted friend. But yeah you can let me know how you like journaling and see how you do well with that okay. yeah Okay, so you do love yourself and part of the processes something in yourself is forgiving yourself as well. Well, you malls kind of like regretful for."
15768.0,Patient,"Treating my parents badly when I was younger. And also. i'm. not standing up for myself. When I really needed to a lot of the times when I was younger because there were quite a few situations with men, in particular with men. That I was treated really poorly and I wasn't I didn't take it upon myself to put my frickin foot down and say like this is enough like I tried many times, but I always ended up giving in, and I, I feel like. yeah that that part is kind of hard. It makes me feel. regretful I guess. Oh yeah. yeah I feel like Maybe my life could have gone a bit differently or I wouldn't have had to struggle through the things today did struggle through high just been able to like be vocal and strong and like tell my parents what was going on, instead of just getting mad at them. You know and and like acting out when all I really needed to do was like come down and just talk to them. But I want them to know, and so I would just lash out at them, and you know not come home and be out with like my boyfriend who I shouldn't have been with in the first place, because he wasn't a good person, you know that kind of thing."
759.0,Provider,"yeah so you wish that you them or focal you know you wish, you would have stayed up for yourself."
15768.0,Patient,"yeah instead of getting angry, because I would just yell out get angry and just not not be able to communicate my real feelings, is, I would just express them in an angry kind of away. And nobody can hear you when you do that."
759.0,Provider,"yeah it's hard you know, for you know you get your point across when you're just yelling you know. yeah so just talking."
15768.0,Patient,"And out yeah and B and also, I was very resistant to help from my parents, I feel like I do kind of feel like that I like at the time I didn't feel like I was really approached in the way that I needed to be approached like I. But, but I don't know to put blame like sometimes I think to myself well my mom isn't very assertive. You know, like. There are some women that you meet in your life that are very strong minded and they're very like powerful women and they teach you to like stick up for yourself and they teach you to be like resilient. And I feel like I didn't really ever get that, from my mother, because my mother is very. Soft. Which is a good quality and it's a strong thing to be soft. But I feel like my my mom didn't really have a balance of soft and strong it was more just soft and so I felt like I wasn't ever really taught to like how to vocalize myself in a in a way that will empower me. And so I just felt frustrated, you know, like I didn't know how to like I express myself in a responsible manner. That would make me be heard or let me actually be heard, and so I just kind of lashed out but I mean I don't want to. push the responsibility for that aren't anyone else too much, because I know that a lot of it was was me like you know but it's hard when you're younger and you and, like some some shit happens to you. That is kind of too much for you, for like a young person to deal with, in my opinion, like. It can be really difficult when like an adult thing is happening to a child or a you know, a teenager of 16 year old girl. You know, can be really hard to learn how to navigate something like that and handle it in a mature way, even though I wish that I would have been able to like do that I feel like I needed guidance that I never really got the type of guidance that I needed, I never really got so. I feel like that might have contributed to my behavior but nevertheless I feel really bad about it."
759.0,Provider,yeah it sounds like you felt frustrated.
15768.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
759.0,Provider,"Like you know with the fact that you didn't get the help that you needed so clearly needed, but at the same time you acted out in ways, you know that. It was screaming for help you're kind of like screaming for help, but you just didn't do it in a way that was you know conducive for kind of like. You know, in a way that people understood, but you were you know kind of like sometimes people, especially teenagers to act out sometimes because they do need help, or they need something that they're not getting. You know, on and that's the way of kind of like reacting, the way that screaming that they do need help you know if that makes sense yeah. yeah so yeah you just didn't get the whole like you said that she needed from your mom at that time and things happen to you that you know shouldn't have happened, or you should have support now."
15768.0,Patient,"yeah and I feel like they were also times, where I would tell my mom what was going on and. I feel like she kind of push everything down or she didn't like address it. Like just as an example. And this has happened, you know a few times, but just as an example, I think I mentioned to you that I used to cut when I was a teenager. yeah in my early 20s as well, and when I first started doing it, I was. In high school still so I had been a teenager. But I remember. I had you know cuts on my wrist and I didn't have it covered up. Because I was just at home, and I was in my bathroom and I was brushing my teeth, or something like that in the morning getting ready to go to school or something, and my mom came in and she saw it, and she just looked at me and she said you better not be doing that and."
759.0,Provider,i'll clear you're doing it.
15768.0,Patient,"yeah, and so I just feel like. And that was all I ever heard about it was that you better not be doing that or she said, what is that and I said it's nothing, and she said you better not be doing something like that, and that was just kind of it and I felt really ashamed to you know what I mean like. and And then that was it there was never anything more said about that, and that has happened to be for also where there's another thing that kind of happened with. And i'm not really ready to kind of talk about this yet."
759.0,Provider,"If that's Okay, yes okay."
15768.0,Patient,"yeah but um there's something that had happened to me when I was younger that I really, really like hit me hard and I had a hard time dealing with it."
759.0,Provider,that's okay takes take as much time machine me.
15768.0,Patient,And I let I let her know.
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
15768.0,Patient,"And she said, thank you for telling me that and she never said anything about me ever again. And if I think about it as like an adult being an adult right now, and like thinking, if I had a child. And I had a daughter, and she told me something like that happened to her, I would sit her down, and I would tell her like look i'm really sorry that this happened to you, you don't deserve this. But I need to talk to you now about how you're going to deal with this, you know, like. How you're going to be responsible, about this, how you're going to be mature about this. How you're going to like be okay like you know or something like that. yeah like she didn't she didn't say anything about it ever again. And it was something that I. was really like ashamed of. Like I felt really ashamed of it. and I could have just really used somebody to say this isn't right but not that big of a deal and it doesn't have to take control of your life and you don't have to feel any less than because this happened. You know. And like I just feel like I never. She never did that and I don't know, to this day, like if she even remembers that or if she just thought it was something that was too personal and she didn't."
759.0,Provider,want to.
15768.0,Patient,"Do. Something so. I don't know, but that, in particular, is probably one of the things that affects me to this day, and like i've had a really hard time with. um. And I think yeah it definitely affects my confidence it couldn't be the root of many things honestly. anyway."
759.0,Provider,I think it's the Read have been unheard.
15768.0,Patient,yeah.
759.0,Provider,"Like and that's the one time he did vocalize yourself. and your cut down a little bit shut down with her, you know non. Talking about their you know with her in her not you know, like acknowledging."
15768.0,Patient,yeah she didn't address it at all. That was like a feeling that a mom. Like I don't know who who else really would be able to talk to me about something like that other than my mom you know.
759.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
15768.0,Patient,I didn't mean to cry I didn't expect that to come out.
759.0,Provider,"And you're fine you're fine. it's totally okay. Okay okay cool yeah. yeah. When people tend to cry around me, I want to join them some talking. Now, can you start King saffron."
15768.0,Patient,Imagine.
759.0,Provider,"yeah yeah but it's okay. After you know today I want you to are today I want you to you know, do something extra special nice for yourself like even if it's. You know, like I don't know like something that you like to do even if it's like eating some ice cream or just something special that brings you know it's cold so hot cocoa, or whatever you like to drink or you know, do something special for yourself, you know dust. yourself extreme or. You know, because they're being can be a lot, a lot of emotions come up sometimes yeah."
15768.0,Patient,I guess that's the point I guess it's a part of the reason why i'm here it didn't. get me totally comfortable.
759.0,Provider,"yeah yeah sometimes it's not always comfortable and sometimes I am going to challenge you to you know you know what you're going to you know, but you can always feel comfortable just shut me down to. Like. yeah so and everything to become a little bit too much just feel like hold up you know so. yeah only say that to people, because most of the time people just let me do my thing but also want you guys to be aware that this is your space, this is your time. So whenever you say once you wanted to go, is where you know, because the self directed therapy is self centered around you not me as a therapist so yeah just remember that. yeah. yeah. Okay, well, we talked about a lot today so i'm then going to keep it, you know, like we have a journal prompts which you're going to do for the next couple weeks and. you're going to be done with find those on Friday, we talked about you know feeling comfortable in your own skin confidence will continue to dive into that next session okay. Okay, and. You um yeah like let me see I think the next time we'll meet would be December 20. Is that's going to be a good time for you, because I know you're probably be home around that time."
15768.0,Patient,yeah I will still be here so that will be a good time for me.
759.0,Provider,"Oh debbie good time for you, and does the clock still work."
15768.0,Patient,My way.
759.0,Provider,"To clock 2pm. Yes, ma'am is good okay good all right any last thoughts or words."
15768.0,Patient,"I just have one sort of question. yeah um I don't know this is just my own I don't know thinking about it but i've never done this before like I did when I was a kid but is this going how it is supposed to. Like I know that, like i'm not getting super specific about anything that I like want to kind of help with and it's."
759.0,Provider,"A concern hope. Sorry, to cut you off go ahead."
15768.0,Patient,that's okay I just feel like i'm being sort of vague in so I don't know it's like going in the right direction.
759.0,Provider,"yeah actually I thought you opened up a lot, considering that this is you're getting used to me, you know, sometimes it's hard to open up freely with other people that. You know you just just a meeting and i'm sure like it being like over in zoom that's another aspect of it too. You know, so I think you go, I think you did a good job today with you know, expressing yourself, the best way that you could the best way that you feel comfortable you know, so I don't expect people. To fully you know, open up you know just in terms of your comfortability level, especially in the beginning of therapy. But the more you do it, the more like I said we develop like a therapeutic alliance together, you know when you feel comfortable and you get used to me my questions I asked you, you know. yeah the morning will you be able to open up more but."
15768.0,Patient,Okay.
759.0,Provider,"You did a good job today by you know going talking about yourself it's not easy, you know, expressing yourself to you doesn't come easy like you said so, you were able to do that today so good job cool. yeah yeah all right deanna until next time okay."
15768.0,Patient,"Okay sounds good, thank you."
759.0,Provider,you're welcome bye.
