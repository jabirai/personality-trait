You know god's god's gonna bless you it's not plus one i'm saying that he wants me to to get up in part was supposed to be doing. And that's what i'm trying to do, trying to put my best foot forward every area right now."
740.0,Provider,Have you ever consider doing something remote to where you don't have to get up and go. You can just try to plan something here I mean.
12233.0,Patient,"You know. i'm not really. Here right I just I have really found anything out there that doesn't look like a scam to me. If they're out there, I haven't found I am looking I am looking. So this means, sometimes it is so. What does it."

740.0,Provider,"yeah that's the other that's, the main thing it's fine that's another option just going to it. And the good thing about indeed they actually help you, with your resume they can actually kind of tweak it for you so but, even though you have somebody else have your resume for you. Once your resume in Spanish going into planning on indie all you have to do the type in the search box. Are you have to do is type in remote job. from home.

Just they have thousands of jobs available. A lot of those jobs are remote. just apply and so somebody calls you. A lot of a lot of times some jobs was so desperate to the point to where they give you sign on bonuses when you sign on with them. because everybody. yeah because everybody's leaving and so companies are basically open their hourly pay. they're adding on sign on bonuses and things like that, because you because they're trying to keep people or they're trying to draw people in. So save you can use it as a resource to because I know right now it's kinda like a waiting game between the Attorney and disabilities office and between. You and the unemployment office so right now it's kind of like a waiting game, well, I understand they're waiting don't. Bring funding. So. Yes. See about doing it i've heard people get on real fast, I mean. it's possible."

740.0,Provider,"I think it but, but at least it is a for this session, hopefully, there are some I wouldn't want an alternative to be able to see because. A lot of times what we see now is there because, since everybody. we're kind of at a stage was top of great resignation so everybody's resigning a lot of people are resigning because of the fact that people are forcing them to get the vaccine and I want the vaccine. A lot of people are. Relying on the other, have to resign and because of the fact. That when when Cobra first started everybody was at home and now, now that people that have the space for opening back up. On some want to leave, they have to go to work. Then another person of other part of. majority is resigning because they're starting their own business, so they are leaving to be restarted business. And so, currently right now, they leaves nice job 9 million jobs available in the United States of America. One of those jobs are yours. And price. dry, you can you can do it in the comfort of your own."
12233.0,Patient,"blossom looking. You know no problem with that at all. I just i'm afraid of, and I got a big fear of this my wife my wife is bill she's. she's she got sick she has COPD. what's makes her an at risk right."

And I was like i'm not I can't I can't afford to become begging and in and out of the home, I don't want to be a rest of my child, you know thing, as I stated so and that's and that's why i'm. telling you I mean I understand it can be very stressful. there's not you know saying you know we can go over cope with you, we can go with yourself, but this this stuff is just life, and so you know it is being able to do the do the best that you can what what you have in the one thing one of the best things you can do at this. Time is to understand a seek out all your options, I mean literally seek them out to be with the option of how many options, you have. And you'd be surprised to know that you have a lot of options available to you at your leisure, where you don't have to pull out your patients. Or what have I say, and then, at the same time, with an option of having a job, the good thing now is it the pandemic. has taught us that you can be productive being at home and so now, you know you can now, you can speak at job, the way you can work them right in the comfort of your own home."
12233.0,Patient,"i'm just monitoring the quality of jason's you know that are out there. You know my testers for. Driving a truck i'm a mechanic tell me, it seems like."

12233.0,Patient,"No, it doesn't."
740.0,Provider,So.
12233.0,Patient,you're right.
740.0,Provider,"that's why we look at we look at option option option, you know i'm saying to try to alleviate as much pressure that you fill on you right now, if possible, because at the end of the day, you ain't no good so you why you ain't no good for you."
12233.0,Patient,"yeah you're right this isn't doing very good, I mean I got a lot of stuff on my mind. But I need to do something about it, like, I told you before. You know, God God blesses me. But he also told me that I needed to do and I need to do. yeah you know it's not God plus somebody. or like you know salvation Jesus plus it's not. it's not. right but, but what it is, is, I know he wants me to be productive."
740.0,Provider,"Faith without works is dead. So yeah We understand that we have to work with faith. And that's the thing about it, if you got faith UK where, if you got faith, if you were in a major way that no faith and if you got faith UK wherever you see you see a new boat."
12233.0,Patient,"Like my wife my wife says he said, and I do to you the gods in control or is not. hey one way or another right."
740.0,Provider,"Absolutely, one way or another that's the price and say you have I mean like lift the heat and brought to this far you amen homeless you not on the bridge you got food. You got water you in your right, mind you got close you guys share it so you got everything you need. And so the thing about it is why would he bring you this for just the lead you like there's never like alrighty well I brought you here for you on your own and i'll see you later. That I hadn't worked, and so you can say you can believe and so hold on and trust the process, you have to trust the process. And it's so hard to trust the plastic it's hard to wait. But at the same time you it you just have to continue to believe and hold on to the truth that you know. In the truth is, is that listen at the end of the day. You have been brought this far. and listen, regardless of the fact, you know i'm saying you feel in this moment your wife is healthy you're healthy you got food you got a roof over your head you got water and you got like. You don't have cozy you why don't have cozy your family doing fine. You know these other thing. That you have to really bass gone when you feel their moment of panic, of how am I going to do this and how am I going to do that and how am I gonna you know i'm saying at the end of the day, you have the truth that you have had with don't make away."
12233.0,Patient,"Well, what i'm doing is taking those thoughts captive like the."
740.0,Provider,Words and then I start.
12233.0,Patient,"Then I started doing my breathing. and use the techniques. were first thing I gotta do is stop and pray I gotta pray first like my watch is going to pray first our. First break, however, you want to say no, I gotta take the thought captive. Oh, it was i'm freaking out oh."
740.0,Provider,Come on.
12233.0,Patient,The inside of me and start running like Anson slap my Jeff and I can't have that. See I can't have that I need to do more in control than that.
740.0,Provider,"mm hmm hey. In the in the good thing about you do you, you are in control it just a lot of times these. You have to take control of your thoughts and you can let your thoughts control you. At this point in time you're allowing don't allow your thoughts to control you. You i'm saying, because when your thoughts control you, then that means that, if not controlling your thoughts that is controlling how you feel about what you're thinking your emotional state and how you behave. But when you're able to take Captain those thoughts and you're able to control those thoughts and that means that means benny's you determine how you feel about the situation you determine your emotional your emotional state, and then you determine how you behave. Because reacting don't make nothing change unless you react, the right way. Right and the good thing about it is, is there a lot of times. Even in situations like this that are so they can be so challenging and so traumatic and so much internal. You know i'm saying a lot of times you all you have to do is change of precision and just find things to be grateful for. and be like hey I can't change this situation right now, you know all day I can do, I can I can speak out my options, making sure that i'm capitalizing. On those things I need to capitalize on and they let me find reasons to be grateful, let me look around and find things to be grateful for, I mean if it's a lot of things Bailey. To be grateful for, and those are the things that you have to continue to remind yourself of when you go through these when you go to these. Such a traumatic episode to where you just start thinking about. You know you get bad news on the side and then you get bad news on this side so it's kind of like may and so. It is a fight areas of pool is a push to try to stay positive when everything around you lose negative but that's the beauty of the fight the beauty of the fight is the fact that I can feel find things to rejoice the BAT even though. bad thing or negative things are happening around me."
12233.0,Patient,that's true that's true like my wife and I were getting along.
740.0,Provider,me huh.
12233.0,Patient,"Yes, no all of a sudden she'd be a nice. Yes, and then, once he isn't I go Whitman you been nice lady what's up right now and then. And we'll talk about that. After four to six years we don't just finish each other's sentences, we look over each other just start laughing. yeah. And then, what. Were you yeah we were thinking, the same thing so."
740.0,Provider,yeah.
12233.0,Patient,yeah we literally grew up together so. um yeah and you go through a lot of stuff and 46 years. Absolutely we're in a good spot right now that's something I can no hang on to. respond to yeah.
740.0,Provider,"yeah because there was a time to where you will bark at your wife and yeah we'll get into it and it can be. A you know even would you miss the price, even though this stuff is going on, you don't say you say you look at school, you don't look like you in you in a panic and that's a good thing, because I remember what I remember how you live, initially, when I first met you. Right, and so you know just learning how to give those words over. And and just trust the process and just kind of wait understand that you're not you're not being brought this to be less than the dirt."
12233.0,Patient,there's never left me or forsake. You know godly.
740.0,Provider,Why would he doing now.
12233.0,Patient,"You won't you won't just just me in my flesh, you know my lesbian week I I start to dwell on these things. So I take those thoughts captive given man. God, where they belong he's already beat them down."

740.0,Provider,yeah.
12233.0,Patient,"I do, I do know that he needs me to do everything I need to do. I need to do everything he's put front of me. Otherwise, if i'm if i'm not being obedient, then I got another issue going on and I don't."
740.0,Provider,need.
12233.0,Patient,A spiritual issue because i'll have one.
740.0,Provider,that's. Really really good.
12233.0,Patient,At the end.
740.0,Provider,"You have a spiritual issues and therefore allow your spirituality to overtake your natural issue and look at it through spiritual, as I said, a natural as."
12233.0,Patient,"I need to because when I looked through. Leslie eyes man it's all the things I just explained to you going on. So. You know he will work it out, I know he will. And I told him I said God show me, what do I go to work I work i'll stay there, as long as you this until something flips me out or if it never does that's cool I go to work I got plenty of skill. i've worked as a mechanic I go to work as a truck driver I go to work as a character driven buses senior citizen a whole lot of stuff I can do. But what am I able to do still I don't know. Thanks a lot. Right so in the last two years. have been out there i've changed a lot i've got a. Whole different perspective, I went from from being pretty darn conservative to now being probably in the middle, not leaning too far left but. I mean, I used to be hard right and i'm not."
740.0,Provider,here.
12233.0,Patient,"i'm looking at what you know, like when they try to recall the governor I thought to myself, you know what do help me man over the last couple. of years I got these incentives, I got. These you know the money in the mail, he did a bang on employment. I mean yeah. i'm a republican everything but I can't hate this dude he helped me. You know. me i'm not listen to the rest of my family my family trip oh you gotta get ready, you know he's he's just he said well you know what y'all are lit politics come in and then all I can see, it was eight. years old, I can see hey come out of your mouth because he's politically different than you. You helped me to me i've been out of work he helped. me and I told my wife, I said I can't try call that dude back when he's helped me just because i'm about a different political persuasion of him I can't do it then and I couldn't do it, I couldn't just bolt party line like that. So yeah there's you know there's a lot of stuff going on. But those are my main issues right now and put the medicine will be working. A shot. I shot her. pets yesterday block during our meeting right for the left and told her MED MED seem to be okay. because she said she was going to go on to her mentors and figure out what kind of medicine that you could use to from my anger is she's. She said she was going to get back with me I didn't hear from her. But then again i'm feeling pretty decent right now. I mean. i'm not angry with my wife and I moved her about 90% of the time. But I haven't had any rogue rages or anything. And that's helping me because I didn't."
740.0,Provider,Have although.
12233.0,Patient,"It looks and stuff. Yes, all. The things little things that used to get me right on the edge seem to be doing a little bit better I just yeah i'm just gonna just kind of a paranoia and me. about this covert thing and I, and I know. You know if that's what God chose to take my wife's if you chose to do that paper. I would. I would have to. I would have to events. Last summer I would venture to accept that, because that would be where he chose do, but if I brought her home to her my God, you know what I mean yes. Just like you would your child. And that and that really causes me a lot of distress that I didn't really have before. right because I thought this I thought this disability go through, and you know we bill I, I have a calling as a caregiver for my life. that's what my colleague is right now my life. And I don't have a problem with that. i'm motivated to do that motivated to do anything for myself. As far as pleasurable things to do. I don't have any motivation for that motivation to go, you know hang out with a friend or not having it all I want to do right now and i'm motivated 100%. it's taking care of her she's winded half the time i'm been cooking I do everything and it's all right it's okay i'm doing the dishes and laundry and the vacuum in and all the stuff she did for me for 45. Years I don't mind doing that and I believe that's what God put me to. Do and. And it kind of TRIPS me out when I see that you know, maybe I am going to have to leave the House to go to work that's what I was looking for, we discussed but. it's a trip because I really don't know. And I want to know what he wants for me."
740.0,Provider,yeah.
12233.0,Patient,cuz I don't wanna I don't want to be outside of that if i'm outside of that i've been there before I know it all work.
740.0,Provider,yeah.
12233.0,Patient,"It just doesn't work, so you know I gotta be I got to be in his will I got except as well, and what i'm trying to do is is. Like what."
740.0,Provider,is another option you've seen about being able to be with your wife and get paid for.
12233.0,Patient,How do you do that. You know.
740.0,Provider,You have an attorney.
12233.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
740.0,Provider,Ask ask them. If there's any option at their regards to being able to be a caretaker to your wife and getting paid for it.
12233.0,Patient,"Even if I went to a class to do it, I wouldn't mind that either."
740.0,Provider,mm hmm.
12233.0,Patient,You know.
740.0,Provider,"yeah. I mean, I would."
12233.0,Patient,"I would be I would be up for that if I needed qualifications, I don't have I would totally be up for that, because they're they're willing to pay somebody to come in and help my wife's the county is."
740.0,Provider,yeah so.
12233.0,Patient,Why not me.
740.0,Provider,Exactly.
12233.0,Patient,Your own.
740.0,Provider,Good so that way you can kind of see that option i've seen it happen to me the time before when people with already living in home with a family member and they ended up. working for them and and being a caretaker for them and they didn't pay for any was convenient because there was already living under the same roof again like I said seek out your options you got a surprise.
12233.0,Patient,"Well, you know. yeah I think that that might be an option, because. I just got a jury duty know this right and I filled out my paper that i'm a full time character, with my wife. And, believe it or not, three or four days later. today or yesterday, whatever it was I got a thing saying, excuse me, so I believe that's probably. know I believe that's probably. A legit thing because the Court said no, you don't have command if your character your wife."
740.0,Provider,told me I.
12233.0,Patient,Think that's a real thing.
740.0,Provider,"yeah we're. gonna take care, your wife is right when you're not there."
12233.0,Patient,"Nobody I don't I mean I guess gotta put somebody else in there, but I don't know that you know my my my wisdom doesn't see that at all. I don't see one do that you know and then she's got to make a call for appointments to be driven to a doctor appointments I do all of that. yeah so and again this is something I I feel like I should be doing and. receptive to doing it, I don't have any i'm a bummed out oh I gotta get now it's not like that at all like it is, but everything else, I want to do. Or have the motivation to like my truck I got a nice truck I got a lot of Nice stuff I can do my truck and. I don't touch it don't touch. You know I just don't I don't have a motivation um you know and. Also, without pick up. Some of the techniques, maybe the notice and still tweak it some more I don't know right now we're staying at the same does because it's working seems to be working I don't know if it would work better with something additional or additional. Quantity i'm not sure, but right now, it seems to be working well, so I told you that."
