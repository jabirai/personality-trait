Because of all, no, no it's it's not as easy anymore to fly they all want all this like information and shots and. covert it it's probably because it's too complicated and so like when things are complicated and hard at tend to fear them put it off procrastinate that's all it really is, I could go right, I could buy a ticket right now, though, but I was waiting to get into here, so now my rents paid. If I get a job, then I have to tell them well hey in a month i'm going to need two weeks off I think i'm only going to go for like two weeks, I was going to go for like a month, but I think I just want to go down there just just to do it. Just I don't know because i've already set my mind I already got a passport and I already have the money saved up, so I just need to buy a ticket. yeah one for like $450 round trip from San Francisco or Los Vegas usually those are pretty cheap or San Diego so I just have to take a bus or get a ride down there and bladder there. wow yeah and it's also hurricane season, which is another I don't like Maybe I should wait for that to fizzle down, but then that would be RAD build experience or hurricane.
