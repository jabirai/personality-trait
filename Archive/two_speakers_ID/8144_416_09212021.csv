416.0,Provider,Thank you.
8144.0,Patient,Hello.
416.0,Provider,hi deanna how are you.
8144.0,Patient,"i'm hanging in there, but. i've been pretty depressed. what's going on. I just. I. am having second thoughts. about the move. When I tried to talk to molly about it. She just lectured me about why I had to do this and. That the alternatives were. Just not cannibal and. I don't know if it's."
416.0,Provider,"What are you hoping to see happening. What, as you have these second thoughts, what are, what are you hoping to see happen."
8144.0,Patient,i'm just thinking. That. If I refinance. and get the payments down. Maybe I can afford to just be here. and I was. Pretty upset. I would spend a couple of weekends ago when we were up river and my sisters started. Pushing. scenes seeing your residence things.
416.0,Provider,Normally start attacking.
8144.0,Patient,me yeah.
416.0,Provider,Instead of having you move in with her.
8144.0,Patient,"Well, no. One point she was saying, I you know when I tried to say. You know. I don't want to have to move again. And she said something about. Being there for two more years and. it's like I don't want to move again and two years. And we were talking about. possibilities and. She ended up. praising. Some new senior. residents in this area and it's like. She my brother push my mom. into a place like this, and she hated it she didn't want to be there. When I. tried to tell her, she didn't have to do this. Well, I said I try. And she and I. were on the outs for maybe. door early enough. we're. On the outs for about six months. because she wouldn't talk to me. About mom and what happened and. And now she's trying to rob me."
416.0,Provider,What did she I mean did she. did she say I want you to do this or did she just she just talking about how nice this place was because those are two different.
8144.0,Patient,"day he wanted me to do it, she was just popping it up."
416.0,Provider,Okay. So I think those are two different things.
8144.0,Patient,Okay.
416.0,Provider,I think those are two different things so she can talk up this place that doesn't mean she's looking to make you move into one.
8144.0,Patient,well. I don't know why she would want to talk them up to me.
416.0,Provider,What did you ask her.
8144.0,Patient,"No, I didn't want to get into an argument with her Okay, so I just sat there and said absolutely nothing. gave her spiel and. and I didn't go along with it, I did argue I I didn't join the conversation."
416.0,Provider,"Okay. So without getting into an argument, how do you think you might clarify this with her."
8144.0,Patient,i'm not quite sure. One of the reasons. That i'm. Having qualms is. i've spent some more time down in the apartment it's vacant now. and it's just it's just not big enough like I don't think i'm. going to be happy.
416.0,Provider,So when you brought how did you bring this up to molly when you brought it up.
8144.0,Patient,"I don't remember exact weight. Maybe explaining why I was feeling down again. I have been you know molly and Scott, are still in St Louis. emptying their house there."
416.0,Provider,mm hmm.
8144.0,Patient,"I have all the. Animals to feed and medicaid and. I was giving. To oral. And two shots a day for five days, plus the beating and. it's like. it's Maurice trip with the animals now."
416.0,Provider,And what it would mean it's molly's trip with the animals I don't understand that.
8144.0,Patient,"I wasn't planning. To take the packers when I moved to Dora leaves and it never occurred to me to get chickens that was molly's idea, she didn't run it by me. She ran it by door lady. But i'm the one that's going to take care of them when they're gone all winter. And the outback."
416.0,Provider,Okay. Did you bring that up to her yet.
8144.0,Patient,yeah. Okay.
416.0,Provider,It sounds like you're feeling pretty overwhelmed by all of that.
8144.0,Patient,"And it's it's it's just another. example of. Malian Scott do what they want. They don't discuss things with me they don't ask me how I feel about something. They just do it. I wanted molly to help me put up a section of fence that was needed after Scott took down all the brush that kept the alpacas in the back. No she put it off she added excuses we don't need to do that, until she decided. to redo the corrals and put the three boys out back then she and Scott. Defense. and it's been. it's been really hard. And then getting sucked back into. Getting on myself for mistakes, I made and imperfections and."
416.0,Provider,So you're getting into that negative headspace again pretty pretty easily huh.
8144.0,Patient,So i'm going to talk with my local. survive. provided. here about. upping. The dose on. My and a depressant.
416.0,Provider,"Okay, good first step. Well, I think I said I think that's a great first step, I the. I think that. So much of what you are going through, maybe isn't so much about medication, although I think the meds are a great idea. But um so much of it is about your relationship with molly and a lot of it is I just kind of keep hearing over and over again about one. That you are concerned about your future with regard to where you're going to be and to there's a big theme about you feeling like you're not in control of your life. And the decisions that are made. And those are those are big things that are going to affect your mental health so it's understandable to me that you are kind of backsliding a little bit. What are some ideas on how we can tackle this I have my ideas but i'd like to hear yours. Because what's happening right now isn't working."
8144.0,Patient,"I never got to talk to them. Before they love about. things that were said. At door leaves that time. Scott, was very tense and working long hours and. It it just didn't seem like the time. I was afraid. It would go well. I don't know if I can say I chickened out. I definitely put it on hold. Okay. they'll be back. In. Probably a couple of weeks, maybe a little less."
416.0,Provider,"Okay. Why don't we consider making an appointment if you're up for it, and I think you should try to talk with them, but i'm also willing to do another session to help support you through some of those conversations, if you would like. But there's a lot that needs to be expressed here and it's it seems to Center around those themes and not it's not just about expressing it's about actually coming to some solutions. Because you're you are not finding a solution, neither of you guys are you're not finding a solution that's going to work for you, you have some concerns, or maybe they are going to work, but you still need to talk out your concerns. And I think we can set the expectation right now deanna and I hate saying this to you because, if I could wave a magic wand I would give you everything you want, but. From what molly is saying, and from what you're telling me they're gonna have to be some compromises made around your living situation. And that doesn't mean you have to go into a home that you don't like or you know go into a. An elder care facility or anything like that nobody saying that but. But there may be parts that just don't feel perfect to."
8144.0,Patient,yeah.
416.0,Provider,"So you're going to have to be willing to compromise as well in finding a solution, you might not be you know overly stoked about exactly what happens. And I wish that again I wish I could wave a magic wand and make that happen for you, but that might not be, I want to prepare you for the possibility that that might not be a reality. I hope it is, but it might not be. yeah. that's a hard pill to swallow."
8144.0,Patient,i've been trying. To go through things and decide. What I want to or and or have to get rid of before I move. and it's hard. it's it's really hard for me to. and
416.0,Provider,Have a really emotional.
8144.0,Patient,yeah.
416.0,Provider,"I think that's understandable. So a lot of memories and. lots of good stuff wrapped up in all of those things. They are just things, but it also makes it more difficult when you feel like where you're moving you're not excited move right, then it makes it even more difficult to give up things that you care about to move there."
8144.0,Patient,Right. i've thought about. Trying to subdivide the acreage here and keep the real pretty spot out back. and I just. i'm just having a real hard time right now deciding. what's best gonna be best for me. I know door really needs help. Chris is. it's getting pretty scary he gets up in the middle of the night goes downstairs and makes the coffee and toast and comes back up and it's 130 in the morning.
416.0,Provider,"yeah. nighttime Sir, the worst time for folks with mencia."
8144.0,Patient,"yeah they had to make another trip. backup river, because he forgot something. and it's an hour each way."
416.0,Provider,yeah.
8144.0,Patient,And stuff like that is.
416.0,Provider,"it's going to happen more and more with him right that is yeah it's a degenerative disease it's tough. My my father has dementia so i'm in a similar position in that way, and it is there's no getting around it, it just is awful. And it isn't going to get better. And those kinds of things happen. So planning, for that is is all you can do right and it's great that d'orleans thinking about that it's great that you're offering to help. And, but you also you know you you're a loyal sister and you're looking out for yourself at the same time, I mean you have to to take care of yourself in this situation so whatever the solution is, it has to work for you too. And again. might not be what you want might not be perfect and it might not be permanent. But it's going to be something. you're going to do you guys are going to come up with the very best solution possible."
8144.0,Patient,yeah I hope so.
416.0,Provider,"But in order to do that there has to be some really solid open clear communication to get there it's not going to get there without that it's just going to be hard and angry and frustrating and nobody's going to get what they want. or need. I thought that. Do you want to try and tackle some of those conversations on your own, would you like me to help support you through some of them what would you like."
8144.0,Patient,"i'm not sure yet. I am going. Over to Dora leaves this afternoon I usually on Tuesdays and Thursdays, I have been picking up curtis at daycare at two o'clock and then working in the garden with Dora late for our half two hours."
416.0,Provider,So Nice.
8144.0,Patient,"I had to call her this morning and say I can't pick up Chris today I have an appointment. And, but. I had some salmon that I got for up river last weekend, but we didn't go because it rained and. So I suggest that that I would be coming later today and why don't I bring the salmon then we'll have dinner. Right so. I will be talking. Some with Dora Lee this evening. it's harder. When Chris is there. yeah sometimes. He goes on upstairs and turn the TV on and moves us to ourselves, but not always so i'm not sure. Where it's going to go to."
416.0,Provider,"Well, it could go either way you could even say to her let's put on a show for Chris we can talk a little bit."
8144.0,Patient,yeah. So.
416.0,Provider,"How about if we I don't know data hub we scheduled our next session yeah let me look hold on I won't be able to see you for a second. I can't see you for just a second i'm looking at a different screen one SEC, so if you're making really funny faces at me feel free. I won't be able to I won't be able. To you it'll be great the video will love it it'll be funny. Okay. Please tell me you're making really funny faces. So we have we do not have anything scheduled after this so. Why don't we do this. Why don't we do this, we could. We could schedule something in a few weeks and and I can leave it open with you either you invite Scott and molly to come join us. And or it's just your session with me and i'm open to either way, but we can just put it on the calendar, no matter what."
8144.0,Patient,I have to reach for the gavel okay. i'll put too many wires here.
416.0,Provider,Absolutely they're like little snakes they just wrap it up.
8144.0,Patient,"Okay, what puts us into all over. and"
416.0,Provider,So what if we scheduled the week or like the October 12 it's a few weeks away Scott and molly should be back by then right.
8144.0,Patient,Oh yeah. What I thought.
416.0,Provider,"Well, if you're taking if you're picking up Chris What if we scheduled it at like noon that'll give us time to finish, so you could go pick up Chris afterwards, if you want to. Okay okay how about that October 12 at noon."
8144.0,Patient,All right.
416.0,Provider,"And if you want to invite Scott and molly, then we can we can do a little. I can facilitate a family discussion for you guys, but you see how it goes see what you're able to accomplish and how you're feeling."
8144.0,Patient,"It might be just molly I don't know yet. Okay, all we didn't know yet. If Scott was going to keep more."
416.0,Provider,Okay.
8144.0,Patient,Because he was. So. upset when he found out he wasn't going to get his profit sharing.
416.0,Provider,Not that.
