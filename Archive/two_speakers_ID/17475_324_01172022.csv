17475.0,Patient,"No don't apologize it happens also right. Good morning, I look a mess pardon me. One of those mornings."
324.0,Provider,looks like you're out and about. Let me start over here. Were you able.
17475.0,Patient,"So what happened was I thought that. me just. Because they call from the pharmacy said that a prescription was ready for me. I didn't even bother to look my fiance went for me and look at the name on the bottle. pick it up, but it wasn't through you, it was through Christina. My primary which I didn't I don't even know why because I didn't call her. um but I don't know if it was on an automatic refill or I don't i'm not sure. But. That said, take one tablet by mouth twice a day as needed for anxiety Max daily dose to tablets. she's put. 30 refill the quantity of 30 zero refills. And this was picked up on. Friday. Thursday or Friday. So. So. we'll get the one that you had."
324.0,Provider,"So I think. she's. she's sending Bernie tab, which is to say, one to two."
17475.0,Patient,"So. In reality, Jeff only 15. right if I if i'm taking them. Twice daily if i'm not but i'm not taking them twice daily all the time."
324.0,Provider,"Okay. Alex T if you're gonna say one to two tablets, then you would send. me that was me that's what I tend to do if i'm going to say take one or two."
17475.0,Patient,Right and that's what I was trying to explain that. it's not every day that i'm taking them two times.
324.0,Provider,Oh.

324.0,Provider,Okay.
17475.0,Patient,"If i'm doing it twice daily but i'm trying to cut back. But there was a day that I didn't go for days without these, and it was. It was the worst to try to do it by yourself okay without it."

17475.0,Patient,You got it.
324.0,Provider,got it you got it.

324.0,Provider,"Well, what will you do when. You don't take it, because if you're going to say you can have one or two. Then. you're taking a chance on actually taking two and then not having enough for. The month so anytime anytime I say one or two that I make sure there's enough, and if you don't take two, then you don't take too, but you have a look in case you take."
17475.0,Patient,Right exactly.

17475.0,Patient,"Barely. I mean I am. But not the way that I should. I just don't have that appetite I don't know if it's just more stress or i'm just. Honestly, I feel like my body my body shutting down a little bit. And when I mean that I mean that. Like I forget that to take care of me, and I feel like i'm just very dehydrated I know that. Just everything. Just everything I just have always been the one tanya that had to fix everything you know my mom was very independent on me. it's always been that way my grandmother, which I took care of God bless her soul, which was my choice, nobody else wanted to do it. Then I became a mom Well then, I became a while i'm other than a mom and I became a mother than a wife, and that was not a good relationship. So i've never really stopped. And found jet and now it's all about who I want to be, and I still seem I can't get there, but i'm going to get. But."
324.0,Provider,"And that's. What you just said, I like that attitude."
17475.0,Patient,Was that.
324.0,Provider,I have that positivity you said i'm going to get there.
17475.0,Patient,"i'm going to get there, it might take me sweetheart chill i'm 5570 but i'm going to get there. You know. I know i'm going to get it's just going to be a process for me, but the everyday going back to. The pit of hell at my mom's is very straining on my body. And she does it intentionally and that's what hurts the most because she knows what she's doing. And my son. This weekend on Friday packed up with some of his stuff and took them to where he's going to be staying. So I just feel so much inside. which makes sense."
324.0,Provider,Does your mother know where she's going to be going.
17475.0,Patient,"She told me, she was going to go live with her sister with an Idaho then she turns around and tells me no. I said mom if you don't figure it out you're going to be homeless, I said I gotta figure out my life now you know before everything was Okay, because you had a place but you're going to wind up in a shelter or mom you. push everybody away that's tried to help him, she has nobody on here because of her mentality of thinking you know and her mentality is this is my job to do it."
324.0,Provider,I should do it.
17475.0,Patient,"For her now you got to pull your way to this, I didn't I didn't pass this. You know. So. My cognitive is not well I have too much too much to think about. And it has to go to court, you know what this is she's just making things so difficult."
324.0,Provider,"But i'm gonna give you a little a little advice. Like you said you started to take care of in your life to be hydrated. you're gonna have to. I mean. make a conscious effort. To take care of yourself. You don't want to end up in the hospital special with cold in the hospital the impact, right now, you don't want to end up in the emergency room for dehydration and. You know from lack of. fluids, and not eating so you've got to have to take care of yourself, first and foremost."
17475.0,Patient,I know.
324.0,Provider,Your mom i'm definitely concern. You know that's your mom Of course you love mom that you got to take care of yourself. and your son.
17475.0,Patient,Thank you.
324.0,Provider,"Because if you don't take care of yourself you're not going to be in a good for him. So right today, while you guys are out. I want you to literally pick an hour sit down and. I don't know coffee shop sandwich stop shop or something. and It just. It just block out everything else, but just just an hour take a moment for our. I wanted to do that."
17475.0,Patient,"And that's all stuff that I would do before, and that I love doing, and you know that was my time, you know it's always been about the little things in life for me it's not the big thing. You know it's always been the littlest things makes my day. And it makes me. The happiest. i've never been i'm very simple person i'm a very simple Gal that she'd say I don't like material things that's not who Jenny is it's about the littlest things in life that mean the most to me."
324.0,Provider,I have a roller to move in and so. My final thoughts.
17475.0,Patient,"No, no. Not at all I haven't thought about that just very sad, you know about everything. that's going on with my son, you know I feel like i've let him down in many ways. But just very sad but no suicidal. tendencies nothing like that no thoughts of it at all actually. Which is quite surprising to me because before it was coming in a lot more, but I would never act on it, but we all have it like think of things like that, but. You know the best place to be better off without me here, but no I got it has me here i'm here for something you know i'm just trying to figure out what it is."
324.0,Provider,yeah I want to go. Like it's a while you're out. was still early even breakfast. i'm. Take an hour. You know you're not eating and. Our have pancakes.
17475.0,Patient,that's my favorite.
324.0,Provider,All today cuz it sounds good right now. And I mean literally I don't think about mom just. Think about Jen. Our right. to join me something cakes. Yes. And some orange juice or coffee or whatever it is. And and just focus on this one so.
17475.0,Patient,"I mean, it is hard to do isn't it."
324.0,Provider,"It is, it is because. A lot of. I think a lot of women are like that they. Our caregivers to everybody else they want to make sure that everybody else's okay families Okay, and we don't. Think about ourselves if."
17475.0,Patient,You don't.
324.0,Provider,"Think it's true don't. know. No, you don't actually. know what they're talking about self care all the time self care self care."
17475.0,Patient,And I know I am in my throat.
324.0,Provider,Is your okay i'm not good enough selfish way. it's my job to take care of themselves. And I will tell everyone that analogy. If. They tell you to put your oxygen mask on first before you put your neighbors on your neighbor. And I. use that as an example with everybody you got to take care of yourself.
17475.0,Patient,"Now there's not there's really not and. You know the world moves too fast, sometimes we just got to slow it down and smell. What God created you know and. I forget I lose sight of that a lot. That this is. god's creation we don't stop to smell the flowers the birds hear them chirping because life is so fast for us that we forget until he knocks us and we here i'm Okay, yes, I hear you I know what you're trying to tell me to slow it down. So you know I know what I need to do charter it's just so hard for me to get there, my mind don't, allow me to get there. You know, and I really I really want to get all these canals the pans I do. i've been wanting to for a long time. a long, long time, but I know I can't do it by myself. You know, because it just my vision goes all whack everything is just not good, you know. But my insurance. They don't allow it, and I don't understand that the ones that need it in the mental health. realm they don't have much for them. And I don't mean to sound me, but you got these people that are on methadone and medicare pays for it. I don't get that you know what i'm saying I don't see the two to two at all I just don't when there's so many people out there that need that help in the mental. realm and they suffer, you know we suffer and that's why so many people take themselves and. Do what they do, because they're in so much agony."
324.0,Provider,"I don't disagree i'm up in the first part of this morning already insurance. and trying to get records was approved and it gets frustrating, because you have medications that will help. I just clicked you can't get to it because."
17475.0,Patient,You know back.
324.0,Provider,When I was enjoying that.
17475.0,Patient,"It is, I you know doing you know medical billing for many years it was straight just medicare medical everything was so simple becton now it's not it's like. You know, and even the seniors they don't get what they need come into them either you know I just. that's why I really wanted to do my bachelor's and being a counselor and helping these young ones, you know I want to, I want to touch as many lives as I can. Because I know what I struggled with inside and out, and you know I want to be a voice for somebody because I feel like I would have accomplished my day by helping somebody else. So you know it, those that that and substance abuse is my two main things to my heart, because you know I suffered from it and i'm going through it, you know and there's not enough people that care in that in that. Group. But I hope one day i'll get there, too, so we'll see. So that's why i'm so thankful to all of you that are there for me and the group, and you know. because sometimes you feel alone in this dark place. And nowhere to turn to you because you got to be careful what you say, the pack team will come up the popo will come get you that's what I say. i'm not doing that you know that's not where I need to be I just. I just need somebody so i'm just to listen."
324.0,Provider,and your attitude is everything the positivity. There and that's the attitude that's going to get you to. When you're trying to we're trying to be.
17475.0,Patient,No thank.
324.0,Provider,You that's very sweet of is a positivity and. optimism there. Because i'm a believer in positive thinking in. which you go absolutely what you put out there and and universal.
17475.0,Patient,will come back tenfold yeah.
324.0,Provider,It was good. To be out there. is a really. helpful.
17475.0,Patient,"Thank you all all spread that more around I tried to I tried I try as hard as you know, I don't try it just comes to me it's not something I tried to do it just. Who, who I am inside, you know i've always kind of been that person. I love to see people smile, you know because I don't smile often so to see somebody else smile because of something i've said, or just done from my heart that just it just gives me pure joy. You know i've always wanted to be a. flower that takes the flowers the delivery girl, because I would love to see people smile with when they get flowers, you know there's not too many people do and to me that's just so warming to the heart, you know I don't know if it's a crazy story, I guess, I don't know but. yeah it's just something that i've always dreamed about doing. I think a lot like that, but it's but it's reality, I mean not too many people smile a lot in this world anymore."
324.0,Provider,A lot of it.
17475.0,Patient,"yeah oh yes. It is. And I tried to just to be like you know, even when I walk into the store I talk to anybody, you know, and you never know it might make their day they might not say nothing back okay well i'll pray for you, you know, but then there's those ones that. You know they missed they're missing that. So they're like on a stun you know, and especially the elders. Oh, they wanted somebody to listen to them, just to talk for five minutes that's it and they walk away with the biggest smile and their hearts full and so is mine. So I try to I try to give that as much as I can, and no matter what I go through, because they they're also helping me, at the same time."
324.0,Provider,I was thinking.
17475.0,Patient,"Well, thank you, thank you, I tell my son that all the time. I tell my son, you know you'd be kind be loving. Be that person, you want to change in the world. and You know he's done fairly well so far. And I hope that's instilled with him for for many years to come, because it's going to be his greatest blessing later on in life, because when the world is curl he's going to be that right. And he you know, because my son's game. You know my son is gay and. that's a big one for him, so he really doesn't understand yet how the world could be cruel. And I can't protect them tanya from everything I can't I could just died him and love him, no matter what, and he has a good sense of friends per se, but he doesn't come off that he is but a mama knows a moment and we've talked about his. Some of his friends are so. He knows that moms always here if you need to talk about anything and he doesn't know that and I painted around because they all everybody's saying to me. race color gender, no matter I don't care there's somebody's child there's somebody brother sister uncle it don't matter you treat them with respect unless they're going to come at you with an Uzi well then, we have some problems here but otherwise in that you're all going to be true. You know, so I mean that's the way, I feel that he's no different than anybody else that puts on their socks. You know so. that's what i'm. he's making me very humble in that in that Community because. We don't know how to approach and we don't know how they like things you know, we were not that's not what we're taught. But yeah so that's another thing that I I go through, but my love's never faded, maybe his father has but not me. he's my son I burned them I carried a I nurtured and I had pains for him. No stretch marks, but I had pain. But he's my greatest blessing tanya he's my if i've done something right in this world, it was my son. that's my biggest blessing my biggest reward in life that God has given me. and his mother to."
324.0,Provider,know that.
17475.0,Patient,"You know, he does, I tell them all the time I can't tell them enough, you know because I was never taught or never told that. So it's very important to let your child know that because. They they need to hear that you know they need to hear that we're doing right or wrong, tell them what they're doing wrong, but then teach them give them the skills, the koeppen ISM to do it another way, that would work, you know they don't know either where their teacher. So yeah but i'm doing okay tanya one day at a time, you know it's just one day at a time for me. And being out on the streets to is very hard it's very tough very draining. But you know we we've been doing this for a minute and, hopefully, something that God will bless us with so. that's what i'm afraid for. To have, thank you, thank you, I don't even know I haven't I didn't do and. it's just not I know."
