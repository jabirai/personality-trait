705.0,Provider,which will be jenna harper is a crisis individual session.
11476.0,Patient,Give me just one second.
705.0,Provider,Okay. yeah there we go. Okay yeah. hey what's going on tonight.
11476.0,Patient,"i'm so i'm sorry if I rambled on don't really make sense and. One of. My biggest kind of triggers anxiety inducing things. is specifically like mass shootings kind of thing. Right and there was one today. Specifically, at a grocery store and I work at a grocery store. And it's hard that and just in general, when that happens it's hard for me, but the other day at work. A man had a seizure in a different i'll than I was in, and all we heard was screaming and call 911. So. I. Just like ran. kind of thing, and that was my last shift and now my shift morrow shooting happened today um. So I guess I don't I don't know just trying to deal with that. Because it just kind of makes me freeze like I don't I don't you know."
705.0,Provider,"Well, today, you did, because you called so thank you, and this is a step, where you're like you know what no i'm going to talk about it and i'm going to work through it. And jenna with you share how you share things, as you know, that's the beauty of what we do here at bright heart health there's no editing. So, as it comes up just let me know but that makes sense hearing you describe like already This is something that you're very sensitive to and to have that event on your last shift are still thinking about it."
11476.0,Patient,"yeah. And like I have my medicine, so I know. I have that I guess it's the hard part is just. The thoughts that go through my head, you know because I I do i'm a disaster thought kind of person so like my head just my mind just goes to the worst possible scenario. So yeah I just I I just feel like i'm. I can't stress i'm trying to distract myself, and you know. Right right and."
705.0,Provider,Even in the moment and that is like everything's heightened and high alert when you don't know what's going on is traumatic and you heard that from an aisle you got yourself out that day correct.
11476.0,Patient,yeah I ran.
705.0,Provider,"Okay, in that itself jenna is a form of protection that even in a crisis, you did what you needed to do, and you got out. mm hmm today is in crisis and You ran to it and you're working it out so there's going to be different situations that you're already adapting to. mm hmm and you're right, you do have your medication so it's like okay that's like an insurance plan right."
11476.0,Patient,yeah yeah yeah. So yeah just a lot of emotions I guess.
705.0,Provider,"Great understandably so, is there, is it the sound, is it the site like what keeps replying."
11476.0,Patient,"i'm really specifically is me being shot. Okay, just the vision. I see too many movies, I read too much stuff online. And yeah just cut or like hearing just the popping noise from another i'll or something. yeah so it's kind of it's kind of very visual."
705.0,Provider,yeah and when it's like this it does feel really real and it feels very anxiety provoking and so you know that whole you got to name it to tame it.
11476.0,Patient,"yeah The good thing is, I can see, I can easily get distracted like from that thought process that might train and. which I guess is good right it just sucks that it comes back and then I have to like get distracted again by something else you know what I mean."
705.0,Provider,"I do, but also it's understanding that you already have the sensitivity to the shootings and then to have where it is you know, an emergency happened you didn't know I can see jenna where even if you didn't have this before you would have some anxiety, most people, what about that event. Yes, definitely. yeah it's heightened for you, of course, because you already have this where it's a concern and it's on your radar."
11476.0,Patient,"Right yeah. yeah it just it's a really a you know it's a real concern to so it's it's it's hard for me to be like oh it's not a it's not a phobia that comes into my everyday life or anything it's like kind of a possibility everywhere right so. room, but also, I feel I I know how to talk myself down a little bit you know. it's just I hate that I have to hate that I, but I understand that and most people would would be anxious about that."
705.0,Provider,"yeah exactly and by you, paying attention and you're already interjection yet entered intervening or interjecting with. i'm not going to just avoid it i'm going to talk about it and not as a you know definitely an action step. And so, now we know you know okay so part of it is the visual of where you're thinking you know possible you get shot and things like that, and then bringing it back today that how, how can we restore that safety. Like in your House right now. Do you feel safe in your House, yes, what makes it safe for you."
11476.0,Patient,i'm. The locks my my boyfriend I guess. My my dog being comfortable. which I guess are hard things to be able to do at work. um. yeah I guess knowing what to expect I guess.
705.0,Provider,"Okay, and so that's home environment. yeah yeah so I mean that sounds like your home environment is safe for you. And then, if we you already knew her jumping to work, and I know absolutely a lot of those things should do you put out there, you probably can't take those to work. yeah However, in the past, if you think back when you felt safe and secure at work has there ever been a time."
11476.0,Patient,"yeah um when yeah when i'm distracted when i'm listening to music. Okay, and it it really. It you know gets me just in the zone, because I just do like personal shopping, so I just I don't have to like pay attention really it's anyone else. yeah music definitely helps. Honestly, just looking at pictures of my dog on my phone like helps distract myself."
705.0,Provider,"mm hmm. So, and those are things that you can do. Do you have like if you're doing the shopping, can you are there times that if you go in and you're feeling like you know what I need a break, can you give yourself that."
11476.0,Patient,yeah we get like a few minutes in between each order so yeah they're definitely I have some time to decompress.
705.0,Provider,"Okay yeah it's like Okay, so now it's like the music is there, certain stores, that you have to shop in."
11476.0,Patient,Just one store I stay at the same the same store.
705.0,Provider,yeah. same store mm hmm. where's the safest part and you're in that store.
11476.0,Patient,"Safe like that I think is status or that I feel safe justin. um I I feel safe this there's a bench by the door. um and in my disaster scenarios, you know i'm like okay i'm by this on this bench by the door can just run out."
705.0,Provider,mm hmm.
11476.0,Patient,um yeah so probably near there.
705.0,Provider,"Okay, and I like to what you replace that with how you're like in the event something did happen, I could just run out so that's already your escape plan."
11476.0,Patient,yeah all my anxieties very practical is really.
705.0,Provider,"good to know about yourself and that's where a lot of times when a when a person. You know, sometimes like the I was working with someone in the scene. was that there was a gun in that someone had been shot, and that was the vision that kept replaying and and time they were able to replace the gun with a blow dryer and even describe the make model number."
11476.0,Patient,"You know, every day."
705.0,Provider,"Of the blow dryer to put themselves back into control. And and extinguish of what their original image was to help calm so that's what i'm wondering to jenna is something like that, like what you did where instead of where it's heightened and what could be happening is it's like okay now i'm focused on the bench and there's the door."
11476.0,Patient,You know yeah.
705.0,Provider,"And those are the you know i'm just putting some things out there because we're all different, and so you might try this just be like you know what or if you're replacing it where you're having that vision of where are you seeing the gun."
11476.0,Patient,"yeah I don't know, but I think I will keep that in mind, for when that happens. To try to use that because I am not really I don't even know now I can't really think about what happens during like what happens my brain during that but yeah."
705.0,Provider,"yeah the shield is another one that's had a lot of really good you know feedback on people, will you use the shield So you see, whatever could be the crisis coming, and it's year visualization of a shield as just that that you know, and some people even will raise her up and just. Like look yeah here's kind of English know to get you back to where you're feeling more secure you're feeling safer."
11476.0,Patient,I think I feel a little less near the edge.
705.0,Provider,"Good good good, and it is troublesome of what's going on, and when you have it happen closer to you. Even Yes it peaks yeah mm hmm. What else has helped you in the past."
11476.0,Patient,"um. In those moments I guess really I mean it's obvious, but like deep breathing just really cuz my the adrenaline rush makes my body like shake almost you know, and my heart goes crazy. So really just deeper than I have some like relaxation music kind of thing. That does like a deep breath with it. So that really helps and I can do that, like on my break I can do that kind of thing. yeah sorry trying to think of other things."
705.0,Provider,"yeah then definitely the breathing and we already know with anxiety that the blood pressure, goes up the heart rate goes up so you're interjecting by by the deep breathing the box breathing have you tried that one too."
11476.0,Patient,I don't think so.
705.0,Provider,"it's the you breathe in for four hold for for release for for push out an extra four four. Okay yeah so it's more like you breathe in. hold it for four and it's hard to say, while you're talking but. yeah and when you push out through your mouth. And then it's an extra push."
11476.0,Patient,"Okay, to like relax you or."
705.0,Provider,Do you feel there's a very slight difference when you push that extra for out that last time.
11476.0,Patient,yeah I feel like my chest goes down. yeah.
705.0,Provider,"That is a technique that the military first started using the box breathing when they're going into a mission to help calm down the military service members. They really they, let us know about it as civilians. It works too. it's that extra push out that's going to give you that edge where it brings it down a bit."
11476.0,Patient,"yeah definitely try that come. I think i'm okay now I you know I want to I took some medicine so i'm going to try to do some breathing and maybe the music, I think."
705.0,Provider,"I think that's great and you did exactly the right thing jenna because my you going towards it, and you addressing this tonight, it just creates a new pathway in your brain that it's like anxiety will not debilitate me i'm not going to stay in my tracks and over."
11476.0,Patient,"yeah it was like I could call off tomorrow, but then I just have to work, the next day, you know it's like it's not going to i'm going to go away kind of thing you know."
705.0,Provider,"Right and being able to go in and already have, I mean, first of all, you have valid reasons for filling how you feel it's like yes, I get that and then the second is bringing into, and I have the coping skills that I may need right now also have my exit plan."
11476.0,Patient,mm hmm right okay. It makes you feel better.
