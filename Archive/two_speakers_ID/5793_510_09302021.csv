And so I always appreciate your candor and you always were one of the bravest you would always start us off, and I think you always lead the way trying to show the group Members like yeah it's okay to talk about this it's okay to say it out loud."
5793.0,Patient,"about it because, once you talk about it it's working out there in the universe, and once it's out in the universe like oh i'm not crazy I it's okay to feel like that oh.

510.0,Provider,"Well, you talk yeah I know I know you shared that so. If that is the motivator to keep you on point well Keep it up, but I think part of it, hopefully, is. You you are just recognizing that you're doing what you need to be doing but i'm hoping the system that will eventually kind of not recommend that anymore, because he's really done, really, really well this last couple of."
5793.0,Patient,"I mean, how is this new girl, have you met her the new therapist have you met her at all."

I know we had a lot of show and tell animal, so I think so, but her name is Karen and what's Nice, I think, for you is she has a strong background and substance abuse.

And so, some of the Karen as we're a little exuberant and started switching them way too early, but nonetheless they will begin to outreach you, you should get however you request notifications whether it's email or text or phone."
5793.0,Patient,they'll ask you to come.
510.0,Provider,"To the virtual clinic to schedule and inform you of the therapist change which you already know about, but that's when they'll schedule it, for whatever reason, though you're like I haven't heard you know feel free yeah just call that."

And like i've been trying to get them to treat it treat it treat it and now my kidneys are starting to bother me like I can feel my kidneys hurting so i'm glad the appointments coming up, but at the same time that's as soon as I can get into him."
510.0,Provider,Oh wow yeah now usually if there are specific kidney issues you would see a nephrologist you would see a specialist.
5793.0,Patient,"But it's because of my hepatitis. That i'm having to do so, he has to treat the hepatitis."
510.0,Provider,"Okay, all right, what are you doing for the hepatitis, do you take meds what are you doing for treatment. Nothing no you're not treat it okay. Okay yeah it sounds like there needs to be some some additional strategies at this point, especially if you're starting to have medical physical health symptoms that's the earliest Oh, my goodness that seems."
5793.0,Patient,"That that they thought I had probate and that's the earliest, they could get me into see him with Kobe."

5793.0,Patient,"available, I never had the days that he asked cancellations, he just leaves instead. So i'm like really you told me to call it seven o'clock every morning, to see if I could get on a cancellation and every time he get somebody cancels he just decides he's going to take a long lunch or he's gonna be gone or blah blah blah blah."
510.0,Provider,So we'd like in this doctor. Do you like this doctor. I love my daughter okay okay.
5793.0,Patient,"He was with the beginning of my recovery. he's hazim. recoveries gone, but yeah."
510.0,Provider,"Okay, all right just throwing it out there just seems like. really hard."
5793.0,Patient,Family here has everybody has the same.
510.0,Provider,I know you're in a little town name. Okay.
5793.0,Patient,So.
510.0,Provider,"I know you're you're nervous about David come in coming home and there's I mean there's a history there right we, we have to let's talk about the elephant in the room, so. what's what was the last conversation sounding like between the two of you."
5793.0,Patient,"Oh he's just excited to come home, I told him that I became a hoarder while he was gone and I started fema camp route and I hadn't gotten around to it, yet he said to do my best, and he helped me with whatever was leftover which she would never do in a million years like ever. But. that's so that's what i'm doing, he should know is outdated for sure soon, but I he calls tonight i'll talk to him about two or three hours after I talked to you get done talking to you and. And then ya know we. were in the same camera we started off in so I mean we should reply in here there's plenty of room once I get it clean now."
510.0,Provider,"yeah yeah okay. Do you still feel that you know what your options are if things do go sideways or if there's escalations because hopefully he's on his meds hopefully he stays on point does what he needs to do, but you know you can't do his therapeutic work you are not responsible if. He makes other choices and decisions about his medical emotional health substance abuse."
5793.0,Patient,"He plays, this is the one I use I actually do what i'm supposed to do within the system, I did my doctor's appointment. Everybody keeps wanting to come in. it's fine I don't know my doctor's appointment. i'm a very person."
510.0,Provider,You are well so. But maybe.
5793.0,Patient,"He did I do have to set boundaries and i'm not afraid to set the boundaries now like, he has to stay on as mads he has to follow probation he has to go to his because he either needs to get disability or get a job that i'm not doing the paperwork for either one of them. yeah shouldn't have and."
510.0,Provider,So.
5793.0,Patient,"But it all up and be like yo I need to come back blah blah blah blah. And he's not gonna be able to have chantelle so he's gonna have to have a different doctor because last time I switched and gave up shipped out and what would Dr Hall, and I ended up getting a Gentile back because David was in jail. i'm not gonna interrupt this. i'm just."
510.0,Provider,"Saying yeah I mean I think that's you sort of advocating for yourself a while on your mental health and your substance abuse sobriety. yeah I i'm proud of you, it sounds like you really are ready to kind of ensure these boundaries are set, I think you care a lot about David and he cares about you, too, but. He can't put hands on you and you cannot do his therapy work, you can only regulate your mood and do your thing, and you can be a support to each other right, but you can't you can't do his work, and he can't do yours."
5793.0,Patient,"No and honestly. Most negative influence on my sobriety so. No worries me too. I know. I know myself control like I told him i'm like look i'm not on 12 nuggets went down to 10 he's like you're stupid, why did you do that, like because I want to get off the program sometime the next 25 years."
510.0,Provider,"yeah yeah all rows and that, I mean that can be extremely triggering and very difficult if those are the sorts of responses. yeah yeah you are ultimately responsible, but I know that makes it hard, especially within physical proximity he's saying these things yeah Okay, you are worth it, you have shown yourself that you can do this, and your mood has been. you've described it a lot different."
5793.0,Patient,"A lot different I keep telling them i'm like i'm not the same person I was when you went to jail, you might not like, who I am anymore, and if you don't that's Okay, but I like who I am and I never have. been changed that much de de de Okay, but I have i've changed a way more than anybody else has ever seen, I mean his own grandmother who doesn't talk to him asks how i'm doing. What I mean like. yeah they don't even have her job but it's my it's his uncle's his mother so. She asked every time they talk was rose doing with everything blah blah blah blah blah, and the same way it's done Tennessee he asked how i'm doing. david's brother Jimmy is a police officer, he is so proud of my sobriety and doesn't even think that I should be around even once again so. But, again, I really think he's just going to get month I really do."
510.0,Provider,"I don't have anything in it, I know and and you and it's tough, because you will have to just focus on you and what you can do you are not going to be able to control the choices, he makes. So okay Okay, you seem very clear, you know the boundaries, where you start or he ends what you can do what you can control what you cannot. So it's going to be a let's see how it goes but know that if it does go sideways and I hope it doesn't I hope there's like a whole new kind of shift for you both but you absolutely need to make sure that you take care of yourself."
5793.0,Patient,"Yes, absolutely, and I mean he keeps saying he wants to marry me as soon as he gets out, I saw me marry me as soon as he gets out if he wants to marry me he's going to prove to me that he's going to be good to me I ain't gonna do shit. I don't need to have a ring on my finger I don't need that part of it i'm not that kind of person so yeah i'm good I don't even want to get married."
510.0,Provider,"And you don't have to, I think it sounds like you have definitely done some good reflection of what you know works what works for you rose and you've had a lot of time and space without him physically being there and and hearing all the things like right in your in the camper right. It says this is going to be it's going to be the next step and seeing what happens, I hope it goes well, I really do."
5793.0,Patient,"I mean, I have everybody here, supporting me if it doesn't go well, David will be removed, within a half an hour there will be no no hesitation, no nothing don't even discuss multiple times with everybody on the property. yeah i'm in after that it's not my problem so."
510.0,Provider,"yeah yeah it sounds yeah you have we have talked about that multiple times and i'm glad that that has been explicitly reviewed and it sounds like you feel confident and comfortable doing it, I know a lot of times. Women that I used to work with back in the day and domestic violence situations, they there are a lot of reasons, women don't tell they don't talk about it, they don't leave. But it sounds like you, are at a place that you're like no I will let somebody know I will take care of myself this isn't Okay, if he acts out an x out on me so good. that's that cell right here and that self respect and i'm so glad you're tapping into that you are worth it."
5793.0,Patient,"I know that I didn't know that when he left, I mean literally, for the first three months of you'd see me in a at that any point in that time I was suddenly wanted to take me off my end zone, so I slept pitch. But I got off my friends, I was while I was depressed so I obviously didn't really need them, that much they were just putting anxiety that he. caused me."
510.0,Provider,"So yeah yeah and it's i'm so glad you're off the benzo they're really not meant for a long term, they actually can cause other issues and. they're way more effective short term you so you use it that's fine but yeah and you're reducing your suboxone I exactly you are really you've been taking such active steps for yourself, I want you to keep that up. I know we do."
5793.0,Patient,"Oh, I wanted to tell you something if you ever need to go. You should take my email down my kids breed miniature baby go."
510.0,Provider,"Oh well, we have like. Oh yeah We have lots of farms and around and Colorado but you're so kind to offer."
5793.0,Patient,A program they're so cute.
510.0,Provider,I can't wait.
5793.0,Patient,I can't wait when you showed up with you on like i'm gonna have my kids put pajamas on my goats out there.
510.0,Provider,"Oh, my gosh if you ever need."
5793.0,Patient,"But they're at their house, because I can't happen so but yeah no yeah I like to see him a goat."
510.0,Provider,yeah there's nothing better I don't know I mean there's lots of great animals but gosh there's something about goats and pajamas baby goats and pajamas.
5793.0,Patient,mom that breeds them says that they are so. Smart that you can literally house train them and they can be like a dog or a cat as a pet for you.
510.0,Provider,"yeah they are, they are, they are just so i've i've been around more and the past couple years and they're amazing they're so fun they're they're awesome yeah that's awesome I didn't know that that your kids actually bread, goats oh cool how cool."
5793.0,Patient,"Day, so you knew I knew the goat thing."
510.0,Provider,"There was another not in our group, another group I do and when I shared that video she was sharing Oh, I had no idea, and she got her goat on camera i'm like oh my God love love love. it's great it's great very cool well miss rose yes go ahead."
5793.0,Patient,"I just want to say that i'm glad that you told me that you were leaving when you found out you were leaving and then I was like a surprise because that's, the only thing that was hard about transitioning from. The other one to what was her name. Then Cynthia can you remember."
510.0,Provider,"yeah that situation was was pretty tough, and so I this I know as a transition but i'm glad it felt a lot different for you and you had a little more time. To kind of prepare for that shift and yeah That was why I gave such long notice, I really it was about my clients right, I mean of course bright heart, but it was really about you all. needing to digest that information and preparing. yeah i'm glad you're very welcome that was definitely the intent so."
5793.0,Patient,"And you've been great for me like you've helped me successfully do self care learn about foods to eat all kinds of stuff that I had no clue about and at the same time, you know. You went through some shit yourself, you had a family emergency you have all kinds of things changing for you, but you still have that, together, no matter what you held it together. So that's. Like you did a good job."
510.0,Provider,"Oh good i'm glad i'm glad you have found our work together helpful I think you'll be in good hands with Karen. and your next shift your next chapter and what's nice about working with other therapists she might have a totally different style and that might resonate even better, so I I really am excited for for you all so you'll be in good hands."
5793.0,Patient,"I promise look, I hope you have fun at your next job and we're thinking about moving to Colorado instead of Kentucky so like 10 years you might think in Colorado you."
510.0,Provider,"know you never know that's right. All right, well, you you take care of yourself fights. session with bros ran is over zoom room closed."
