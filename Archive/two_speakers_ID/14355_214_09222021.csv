But you know I stepped it because you know you know, some people are are very quiet, some people are very mean room, you know all this stuff about so I decided, you know what. If I don't want to go I don't want you out there if I choose to and I just. You can say. He have patients with them."

And she didn't want to walk over here because she's scared she's going to get you know job I like. Then, that means that your parents way worse in the mind, did you know where you live, compared to me i'm right here my parents is right here, I walk across the street and i'm not for a while you're during nighttime so that's why I try to.
