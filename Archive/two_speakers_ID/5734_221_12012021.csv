5734.0,Patient,Can you hear me now.
221.0,Provider,"Yes, I can. Oh. try again."
5734.0,Patient,yeah I just don't have my headphones on I don't know what that was like taking me out but.
221.0,Provider,That was weird that you back.
5734.0,Patient,"Right now, I just had to go back to virtual clinic I was, like all right we'll do that so."
221.0,Provider,Thank you Daddy went back to you just. didn't just dial back in.
5734.0,Patient,"Well, I didn't I didn't save the the. First, so I had to go back the virtual."
221.0,Provider,A quick.
5734.0,Patient,"Right, I took a screenshot of this time case it happens again so it was like. Good."
221.0,Provider,But good to see you.
5734.0,Patient,"You know, things going. it's going alright so i've been trying to figure out ways to. Though I was talking to JESSICA about this yesterday about how i've been having. Like I guess cravings for like the high of when I was taking oxycodone cuz I was on a rather large dose of it for like over 10 years and to say that. You know the lines blurred between like pain and just you know just the I don't know necessarily addiction, but I guess kind of addiction, for, but you know the desire to be high was you know definitely mixed and yeah. And I know that, with the suboxone that if you. You know attempt to take anything, it does nothing so it's kind of pointless and. But I still like I find myself like making comments like you know, like cuz I mean, I still have like I was explaining to her, I still have my pain it's just bearable, so the suboxone gets rid of like three fifths of it, it doesn't get rid of all the way, but it just makes it tolerable. yeah so and the the thing about it is when I was taking the oxycodone and the morphine and everything you know, I was getting rid of most of the pain, but then I was high, so the rest of the pain, I felt I didn't care about. So it's um I guess the desire to have that back is pretty high, but. In my I like i'm not necessarily worried about potentially relaxing because. In my eyes, I look at as that you know that's it's pointless, because a i'm not going to go through the process to withdrawal from suboxone just to take oxy coat on. For a few days, then go back the box on like that's that's pointless to me that's that's a that's there's more effort in that, then what it's worth and so it's just the issue of having the feelings still wanting to be hi to your rid of the rest of the pain versus. Just being content, I guess, I don't know how to phrase that part but so."
221.0,Provider,"So there's. there. There there the kind of both sides of pain there's the physical pain and there's the emotional pain and and the the opiates do a lot for both, which is why people like them because. You know it, it does a lot for the not just the physical pain, but just the pain of being alive and pain of being a human being and and going through. You know, human sort of things and rent and i'm wondering, for you, Stephen if if you think that there's a component of that kind of wanting to escape wanting to numb the pain of just. living in life."
5734.0,Patient,"i'm probably so I mean. I mean there's a bunch of stuff that I have to deal with on a constant basis so it's but. yeah I mean it's I mean everybody does so, but it's."
221.0,Provider,"I just wonder if that's kind of weighing heavy and making you have that that craving for relief in that way, just the escape of it. probably think about that."
5734.0,Patient,"yeah I can see that so um and it's just. I guess it's more or less irritating to just have that feeling constantly so. yeah figure out like how to get rid of it because I like I said the going through the process of withdrawal just it to me it doesn't seem like it's worthwhile, so I mean i'm not necessarily worried about doing that it's just i'm just."
221.0,Provider,you're in a place where you're not. you're not. you're not happy.
5734.0,Patient,you're done.
221.0,Provider,you're not in a good place.
5734.0,Patient,"yeah i'm tired of the constant like you know oh. I guess more relief versus. Just the little bit that I get this box of gives me, and I know that you can't alter the dose because i'm already. asked you something else to do with it so."
221.0,Provider,"Right so so a couple of things, I think that I think that it's helpful here to kind of split apart the the physical pain and just the the wanting to escape in the emotional pain. yeah and i'm with both of them really it's. There isn't a way to just kind of make them go away, you know this. You know, just like wouldn't that be great like, if I had a magic wand, I could just say it. Here Steven presto you have no emotional pain, you have no physical pain that would be so awesome but I don't have that magic wand and it doesn't exist so. You know. Ideally, it would be nice to just say poof get rid of it, but really it means it needs working through. And the working through of that is very different for the physical part versus the emotional part i'm really glad you're meeting with JESSICA, I know that you guys meet regularly and and to help work through the. The stuff that you have to deal with all the time, like you talked about you know the constant weight of that and how to cope, and how to. How to function with that because I think that if you can come up with ways to. To work through that you'll be better for it your family will be better for it your boys will be better for it and everybody will so continuing to work on that, I think. Is is a way to not have that aspect of that that nagging craving to just get really from that stuff does any of that part ring true to you."
5734.0,Patient,yeah so I mean it's. yeah it does so.
221.0,Provider,I mean so there's that part you.
5734.0,Patient,know full so.
221.0,Provider,"yeah and then there's the physical part so let's talk about the physical pain part. Are you is there anything that gives you that gives you some really from the pain, the physical pain, besides suboxone."
5734.0,Patient,"I do, occasionally, you know smoke cannabis, but it's. I don't necessarily use the leaf version of it, because a the smell smell doesn't bother me it's just because even though pretty much legal. It still bothers some people so um and me, being in the industry i'm in i'm around a lot of people, so I don't. Even though I can personally function if I smoke I just don't do it, to the point that other people know I am. Just like this thing whenever I would take the pain meds like I mean I would be on them constantly so I could function on constantly but not a lot of people knew I was on them. So it's just something that I always you know I mean a few my customers knew about it, because they knew about my racks and stuff but there's most people to that I don't know or don't talk to that you know that i've seen, but they have no idea. So trying to keep it to myself type deal so are used the. they're called bang sticks so it's like the ISA version of cannabis so it's. A lot. It gives me more of like a body high versus then making me high so that's what I I guess like more because that helps mask whatever leftover pain, I might have from suboxone so that helps but I don't do it very often."
221.0,Provider,How much does it help.
5734.0,Patient,"A good amount, I mean."
221.0,Provider,it's it's pretty effective.
5734.0,Patient,"yeah and it doesn't I don't have to do very much of it to make it effective so that's The good thing, and you know I usually I get I get more you know bang for my buck that way to i'm doing it that way, because."
221.0,Provider,"So, to speak yeah."
5734.0,Patient,"Okay, your pack light, you know, like a whole like join their bowl or whatever it is, I can just hold a button and drag it, it can turn it off."
221.0,Provider,"yeah and does that formulation, have a lot of thc or CBD or is it a balance."
5734.0,Patient,"Some do some don't it just depends, I mean there's different strains different strengths and stuff like that so different cartridges have different some do and some don't have CBD some are just only to see some fire content so i'm I have lower it just depends on who you buy it from."
221.0,Provider,"yeah. Because you know CBD heavier on the CBD and lighter on the thc might be a good option for you, because you're really. you're needing the pain relief and that's better for pain relief than the thc which tends I mean it sounds to me like you're sort of also seeking a high."
5734.0,Patient,"Yes, there is a partial desire for that too. Like I said, to say that i'm not furs for as long and the amount and the quantity, that I was on before I need to say that i'm not is just a bold faced lie so. I mean, especially at the level of what I was at it would take anybody, I mean like a week or two to get addicted to it, because it was just such a high dosage. and I was on the for over 10 years, so I mean it's yeah it's there so."
221.0,Provider,"yeah yeah. So you know, maybe more of a mixture a blend of both yes."
5734.0,Patient,"i've thought about that, like i've have. I don't know where when I used to have and make my own combinations because I had a. CBD one that you could put in like you know the E cigs where you can fill it with your own. Your own juices, so I had a CBD one that I would actually use to fill that so what I would do is I would take. The thc one when it's like half gone and I would mix it with the the CBD and it would shake up, and I would do that so that way, I would have both so those words really well I just don't know where those winds and. The problem of getting more of them, because I just like to say I don't know what happened to him, but. Yes."
221.0,Provider,"Have you ever been to a. reputable shop where they have some knowledge about products that are maybe not even the taping products, but more of the grammys or some other."
5734.0,Patient,"Yes, i've done the dummies before i'm the only downside is sometimes they make me overly tired that's the probably bigger thing about if I smoke or anything like that I get really tired and that's why I don't want."
221.0,Provider,"But you know of course you don't. But I really think that there's so many different formulations that it may not be that, because it was a gummy that they're all like that may have maybe it had more thc in it. You know the balance of CBD and thc so you might want to consult with someone who knows a whole lot more about that than I do, because I don't know enough about it, to give you advice on that, but. It sounds like that may be an avenue to get some of the of that relief that you're seeking Okay, what about other What about other physical modalities or other non opioid medicines, do you take tylenol or ibuprofen do they help you."
5734.0,Patient,"yeah I do because I also get. migraines quite regularly, so I usually take etc migraine. quite a bit. Some some days I take it more than others, but I always usually take it and increments of two. And like normal tylenol doesn't use our ibuprofen usually doesn't do much of anything. So I always do the excedrin but that's all it is for migrant i've never really done. Oh, I don't know how."
221.0,Provider,"Right so that's certainly another thing to try, when you when you have a flare up of your other pain that's not migraine pain, you know try some ibuprofen it's a very effective medicine even tylenol can be very effective so certainly worth a try on those things is your pain. localized to just a certain areas of your body. Yes, over pain."
5734.0,Patient,"it's yes and no so it's both because I do have a lot of nerve damage that's part of a problem that so because, when I broke my right arm I compound fractured it. So it tore the nerves on both sides of my arm, so the underside of my arm actually had more nerve damage, because it actually rip through a nerve versus. On the upper half it didn't as bad so on the bottom part of my right arm it's like a J it'll go numb so that's how bad the nerve damage still is and. On my right of me i'm on my left arm it's not quite as bad anymore, but it still has a good amount of nerve damage that as well. So the other issue, too, is that because of the surgeries and stuff i've had my left leg isn't in shorter than my right now, so I have to constantly wear my shoes, because I have installed in my left shoe so that way of offsets me. yeah all because, if I don't want."
221.0,Provider,On your home.
5734.0,Patient,Your car sideways and hurts all time.
221.0,Provider,yeah break.
5734.0,Patient,New issue so.
221.0,Provider,yeah well that's really good that you have the the the inserts does it does it give you enough lift to that you're even.
5734.0,Patient,"know, but if. I were two or three on the left side. On does the whole foot and then I do one it's only like a heel and sometimes depending on the type of in Sir, I can do to heels. Only so that way, though it causes me to be a lot more me it's pretty close, which is frustrating, because for something like me. There is. A way to have like there's a custom shop, you can go to that makes. shoes souls bigger, but you usually have to pay out of pocket, for your insurance will rarely cover it well for me it's a different situation that it's not you know it's it's a medical thing. What prove that is a whole nother story which is not hard to prove but it's hard to get the gut the insurance to be on board with it."
221.0,Provider,"Right That was my next That was where I was going next with that because I think that, I mean that can really make your pain so much worse if you have that constant imbalance and. And those you know either professional orthotics are the shoes that have the you know they they they take all of your measurements and make sure that it's exactly right. They can make a world of difference, have you been evaluated, for that to see if you can get your insurance to cover it."
5734.0,Patient,"No, I don't know where to go or how to go about it because I knew at one time, when I first had this happen. Before I really had it start wearing on my body, I had gone somewhere, because this was when I was seeing when I was taking the opioids and I was saying. I forgot what his name was, but he had referred me to an area to go speak to them, I did, but I think it was like. A year or so into maybe two years into my 10 so direct so they're like that's not they didn't seem it didn't find the credible enough, I guess. What it was they just denied me so like this, this isn't the same medical worthy I guess or."
221.0,Provider,"I see okay. Well, it sounds Stephen like things have progressed. And it's probably worse now. What you're saying you know that imbalance."
5734.0,Patient,Oh yeah.
221.0,Provider,yeah so what I would suggest that you do if you have a primary care Doc.
5734.0,Patient,Oh yeah I do.
221.0,Provider,"Okay, so go have a conversation with your primary Doc about about two things would be my suggestion. One is talk about your leg length imbalance and your need to you know use a bunch of. insoles and and what happens when you go barefoot and how how it makes your pain worse and just kind of talk to them about it and see if they can refer you to someone who can do an evaluation for. The prosthetic shoes the the the orthotics and and to get it custom, so that they can make a case for you to have a. Fully Val so that your insurance can pay for it, so you don't have to pay out of pocket, or at least pay a portion of it, because they are very expensive but boy, they can make a world of difference. yeah so that would be that would be a really helpful thing for to do in the other thing is. Have you tried to give a penton. Yes, nerve pain."
5734.0,Patient,"What about that, when I was taking my oxy codeine and my morphine I was on a 600 milligram dose three times a day or gabapentin."
221.0,Provider,"And, did you find that helpful or was it hard to tell because you were on such high doses of opioids."
5734.0,Patient,"know it helps, but it may be tired."
221.0,Provider,"Yes, it does it does make you tired so that would be the other thing I would talk to my PCP about if I were you yes is maybe getting on, maybe a lower dose of of the gabba pet and that doesn't quite make you feel."
5734.0,Patient,sleepy sometimes I would do half of the 600.
221.0,Provider,yeah so.
5734.0,Patient,"I really did help it was just my bit, and then I don't know if it might have been just company with everything else, why but I mean it was just It made me very tired. Take yes, that high of a dose so. But."
221.0,Provider,"It certainly can but it's worth a try again now and starting at a much lower dose and building up slowly, I would not just jump to a higher dose but see if that can get you some relief of the nerve pain that you're having all the time."
5734.0,Patient,Okay.
221.0,Provider,yeah so that's I think you just picked my brain that's my brain. Those are my thoughts.
5734.0,Patient,So i'll try and figure that out talk to my primary care and don't let her to see.
221.0,Provider,"yeah and maybe you know see if there's a better CBD formulation that might help your pain more and talk to someone who knows about it, I don't know of any any shops to recommend to you, but I think that some places are really good."
5734.0,Patient,"yeah and i'll look a few places up, I mean, I still have a few customers who are in the industry. yeah maybe, so I can see if they know anybody so."
221.0,Provider,"yeah yeah and and and focus on the pain aspect of it, and then you know just kind of mellow on the the thc to give you a little bit of relief, but not feeling overly high."
5734.0,Patient,Your odds of figuring that out so don't go that route so.
221.0,Provider,"Okay, all right, Stephen well thanks for for meeting with me one on one, this is certainly not a conversation we could have. In group so yeah. Well that's good."
5734.0,Patient,Oh.
221.0,Provider,what's that.
5734.0,Patient,About would have been a little bit of a long issue.
221.0,Provider,yeah yeah okay Stephen have a great day.
5734.0,Patient,thanks you too. yeah.
221.0,Provider,we'll see you bye.
