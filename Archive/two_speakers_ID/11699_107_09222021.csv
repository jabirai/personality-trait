107.0,Provider,"Chris. Lord. hi there. I am sorry I am having to join from my vehicle. We don't have our Internet service is down because there, I had to go into town earlier today and the starbucks is not letting us inside and I don't like doing sessions outside, so I was like well do it for my car I get to look at a lovely lake. But they're doing something they're doing something with the Internet, so I get to look at my box that says no, I have service and then, when I try and go online nothing and I don't have good self service reliable self service at my house so. Here we are, I apologize, that I am in the car, but I promise nobody else's in the car windows are up i've got the air on hopefully you can't hear. That or there's no like wind noise no okay good. So here we are Hello. And I do have makeup on but there's something about this setting that just makes me look like I have lived my life in the desert and I have nothing but send damage on my face so again not to be disrespectful I did actually try to be. presentable but you know it is what it is, Miss Anastasia all right i'm living in the real world today."
11699.0,Patient,Okay.
107.0,Provider,"Keeping it real. down to earth So how are you enough about me, but now i've done enough explaining."
11699.0,Patient,"yeah I was struggling in the beginning of this week. Just because I found out that. This week is going to be have to be the last for group and stuff. Just because my, I guess, I found out that my SLA was actually what was protecting my job, up until this point and it expires on Friday, so I tried to see. There was any way I can extend it or anything like that, but they said that they couldn't because there's not enough hours available that I worked for the year, so I was like okay well that makes sense. Since i've been off for the last you know couple months. So that part was kind of you know, obviously bumming me out because I felt like I was quite ready to leave the program yet."
107.0,Provider,"Well, is there are there no other options there's no other way to get any kind of coverage, at least for like another week or so so that's not having to be so abrupt."
11699.0,Patient,"Well, I did look into because when I called him for the ethanol live they're like well, you could try doing Ada and i'm like okay well what what How does that work and they're like it's kind of you know, like the. The same as a family, but a lot lot less restrictions many, and it goes through my work it's better explains it, as well as I can. But um so I was like okay well i'll get that going because I did have a doctor's appointment on Tuesday to finally see the nurse practitioner, and you know get her updated with everything. yeah oh. I went in I gave her the paperwork. i'm still waiting to hear if they got that sent off she said she should make sure that gets sent off today or not, today, but. Tuesday So hopefully it did get sent off. And I asked if I could have. Like basically like a half schedule so like I you know to possibly work, you know few hours in the morning and then have a little bit of a break in between the time that i'm supposed to start group. And then also some. intermittent time ball team off as well that covers. The vertical part of it. So. Hopefully got that sent off. I was again like you said I was hoping to kind of ease back in the work that's the reason why I was like open so like a half schedule. But yeah I again I was just I was bummed out and but yesterday you know I. You know, I was talking to things with group and everything and and. I said that I would you know talk to my boss, to see if there is any other anything else that I could do like. You know any of any other options, I might have and stuff so I did talk to my boss, a little bit today. and thankfully he's actually very you know supportive and stuff he. Just like throughout this whole thing has just been very much you know, on my side about it, you know, like take care of you don't worry about the job. kind of thing so. um but he was very honest, you know he kind of gave me the worst case scenario and worst case scenario is. He doesn't think they'll prove it and he's like he's like I mean there's still good you know possibility, they good, but he doesn't think they will just because I guess cigna have stopped. I guess part time work. it's just basically it's full time and that's basically it, so I don't know if that's just the change that they just recently implemented or that's just how it's been always. But he said again, you know it's you know it's still there, but he's kind of just giving me. You know I like preparing me and everything. And I said that that was good, because I did want to know you know. um. But yeah I mean you know he even encouraged me to like you know your health comes first, you know I don't want you to come back either, and you know every year. You know health for clients because of stress or anything like that so he's like even if you would have to like quit for a while and then we apply casino technologies has dropped openings it's you know it's just a job to take care of you. And I thought that was really nice of him saying stuff. But then like yeah he said to that you know he will try, if I did decide to. Come back on Monday. You know that he's going to try to do his best to make sure i'm like he's back then everything and stuff so it's not such a big shocker for me to go back to work."
107.0,Provider,"So, in terms of your physical therapy for your vertigo. How is that going to. how's that going to work. With work."
11699.0,Patient,"and i'm not sure at the moment. Just because yeah that does take take me I didn't realize how much it will take me out on Monday. yeah because the whole point of it is from what he said is to bring on the system symptoms, not as much as where I would be. You know kind of having to sleep it off for the rest of the day, but kind of just bringing on in it kind of goes away, but he said it's like trial and error at first. So. As far as that goes i'm not really sure i'm hoping that maybe if they don't approve the half schedule that they will just approve the. intimate time if i'm saying that right and intermediate time. or something and that way on the days that. You know I go in like i'll have that time that either I can you know, have a break and then go to work or you know just be able to have that day off without stressing about it, you know."
107.0,Provider,"When when would you say, regardless of what's going on with work when would you say that you're ready to step down from iot which is 11 hours of treatment down to an outpatient level which. If you're doing a couple of sessions a week can anywhere from two to four sessions two to four hours a week, how would you know you're ready for that. Regardless of what's going on with work and life just how would you know."
11699.0,Patient,"Yes, I haven't really thought about it."
107.0,Provider,"So let's start with you know kind of low hanging fruit, if you will, what are your current eating disorder behaviors."
11699.0,Patient,"um. Right now, I think I talked with rhonda. And where i'm at I still have at least done like a binge purge like once every probably two weeks or so. and i'm. i'm still not quite eating enough. she thinks that I could add more like for meals and stuff. yeah."
107.0,Provider,"So what would be adding enough so that you are, what is the goal of that are you on a on a weight gain, or are you on a. stabilization plan in terms of your metabolism, what are you guys working on nutritionally."
11699.0,Patient,"um she hasn't really given me anything to be honest it's more. she's been more open, she she she did want me to work on specifically protein because she definitely saw that i'm not getting enough protein. And then I think after that, which I have been working on with the protein. i've been trying to at least drink a protein shake in the morning, so at least you know i'm getting something in every day. Even if it's not like in the meal that I eat or something. But I have been trying to make sure I have some type of protein and whatever meal meeting. But after that I think it would probably be. vegetables and fruits, I think. But, again, I don't think I have an issue with vegetables and fruits, but I don't think there might go to meter."
107.0,Provider,"So. If i'm gonna cosign you discharging from an iot to an outpatient level of care, I want you to be super solid. On what your meal plan is, I want you to have real clarity on why it is what it is and what your goals are with that and I want you to be behavior free for. At least, a month, but you know at least several weeks, and not have kind of a reoccurring pattern that's just still going on, and I want you to be really solid in your coping skills. So that's kind of my sense of when somebody ready to step down, you know all of that stuff is is solidly in place and, of course, or BMI is in a safe space and all of that so that's Those are my kind of criteria it doesn't sound like we're there yet. So if. there's a big bug walking right here, but thankfully it's, on the other side of my window, so I don't have to like sorry small distraction. So. I understand that life happens the world happens I get it, we need to pay our bills so i'm not saying you can't go because that's. not my place to say that, however, those would be my concerns and just like you're going to try and advocate to go to your vertigo physical therapy, I think you need to consider. What you know kind of the ramifications of your choices, if you if your work says hey you got to come back on Monday, or else you don't have a job anymore. You have to look at what are you potentially sacrificing in your health and you need to weigh that out. So maybe you have a discussion, if you haven't already with your husband and you guys talk about what's the reality of our our finances, what can the family manage what do we want to co sign. You do not have a femoral arterial bleed which means you're not going to bleed out this isn't a near death experience, however you're still pretty vulnerable in your. behaviors and in your symptomatology so eating disorders, can be tricky That way, you know they can kind of look like everything's cool. And then you know really quickly things can get out of place again, and then the next thing you know you're you're back where you were, if not more so, and each time. it's a challenge to kind of get yourself back there it's not impossible and it's, not to say that any of that is going to happen. I just don't want to be like oh cool all right well nice knowing yeah and and not have any kind of awareness about. You know the other side of it. yeah so. Have you and your husband talked about this at all."
11699.0,Patient,yeah yeah we have. The concern isn't necessarily money because his this them demand income. But he is. Like he self employed so um.
107.0,Provider,"You know, he doesn't have reliable."
11699.0,Patient,"yeah that and she doesn't have the benefits that I get with my work like you know so like my insurance is basically been covering you know the program and and and all these things, and then. You know, of course, the kids also need the insurance as well, so. that's that's kind of like the main thing that's that's that's been an issue is. You know, health insurance and. And stuff so."
107.0,Provider,"I think you guys looked into other ways to get health insurance in there, it is possible to get health insurance if you're self employed, have you guys checked into that at all, or no."
11699.0,Patient,yeah we did actually have something in place before I started working again and that was just you know government stuff you know which was fine. that's something that i've been. Trying to do research on recently as well.
107.0,Provider,"So. The challenges that this is coming up pretty quickly, so you don't have a lot of time to research and i'm concerned, based on my time spent with you that you're just going to kind of be like Oh well, I guess, it is what it is and you're just going to go along with it. I get that but I don't want to advocate for that i'm going to advocate that you look into your options you you be intentional about your choice and you don't just kind of go along with what's going to happen. So I mean that's you have kind of I think you have all the information you need you just need to spend some time and and I appreciate that that's a bit of a scramble and it means. More work, not less work in the next couple of days, but I think it's worth the effort so that you can make a decision intentionally not just kind of roll into it, because you don't have a choice you do have a choice."
11699.0,Patient,yeah.
107.0,Provider,"Do you feel like you have a choice, maybe that's where I should start or."
11699.0,Patient,"At the beginning of this week, no, I felt like my choice was taken away from me and that's why I wasn't feeling good about it, and I was really upset yesterday for sure. group definitely helped. You know, bring it a little bit more until the logical part of it more than just the emotional. You know kind of helped me with the in between, you know that wise mind. So I felt like I didn't have a choice at first, but you know I I realized that I did and and that I just need to like you said, try to advocate for myself and that's what I did this morning with talking to my boss, I felt, you know and. I feel by. Part I guess part of me feels like you know. I you know I can give it a shot. And then better. shot yeah. that's a good. Part of it. yeah so part of me feels like I can't give it a shot like I felt a little bit better about it, talking to my boss, because it was really kind of the main thing I just I wanted to possibly ease back into work and, of course, continue doing the. The group group work and and stuff because you know. talking to the other, ladies and stuff. Definitely helps and you know, of course, the other therapists as well as well. um. But yeah I mean. I think that because I again I did talk to my husband, a little bit about it and. We we looked at both I guess both me to the not to me trying to and basically like you know, possibly trying to see how it all works out and then, if it's just just too much, and you know I just need to take a step away from work period for a while. Then he would you know figure things out from there, and you know get me trying to get me back into the Program."
107.0,Provider,"So what does that look like if it doesn't work out with work what is that what's going to be, how are you going to know that."
11699.0,Patient,"Basically, like you said. If i'm getting back into the same place, that I was. You know the purging is acting up again i'm. Not you know, taking steps to continue to to work, you know, on my progress with my eating and and. You know, all those steps that i've i've taking I guess this far."
107.0,Provider,"So let's pretend that you've had a really serious fracture to have bone. A big boat like a femur. And you've had to have reconstructive surgery and you've been in a very specific kind of training slash rehab program and now prematurely we're taking off the cast and all the stuff and we're going to just be like go start running. Maybe it'll be okay. Maybe your bone is fine, maybe it's set or maybe you're going to cause damage that. Will you'll sit with for the rest of your life you're going to have arthritis potentially could get septic you could have all kinds of problems that could be as a result of that it's a risk. it's potentially a life threatening risk."
11699.0,Patient,yeah.
107.0,Provider,"I understand that, because you're pretty functional you can get through your days and it doesn't look or feel super pervasive right now that it just is like it's all right it's cool. it's as serious as having a femur break and just kind of hoping for the best now if life is such that it just is what it is and you just gotta suck it up Sally and make it work. Then you have to suck it up Sally and and wrap it and do whatever you need to do right you got to make extra measures to keep yourself safe. I get that but then that's how serious, you have to be about it, so if you do decide that you're not going to stay in program then you're going to have to really work hard to create a plan to keep you safe. It can't just kind of be like we'll see what happens. that's the piece that i'm really concerned about. Because you're not really at a place you don't really understand your meal plan you're still kind of been a bit kind of weird about the protein thing your your there's some lack of clarity and still some behaviors hanging around that that stuff can just sink right back in real quick. And you have vertigo you have other health issues, all of this is antagonized by active eating disorder behaviors, not to mention which we haven't really talked about you're still working through a lot of the mental health aspects that drove all of this in the first place. So. i'm not saying you can't do it i'm just saying you're in a you're in a precarious spot right now and. If you do decide to go that route you're going to have to really work hard to keep yourself safe. And not just kind of. You know hope for the best and. Put a smile on your face."
11699.0,Patient,grin and bear.
107.0,Provider,"yeah No, this is not one of those scenarios."
11699.0,Patient,yeah. Okay.
107.0,Provider,"So um. What So what can I do at this point to kind of help you because I don't want to you know I don't want to belabor that point and at the same time I don't want to be dismissive about it is there. Other things that we can talk about this, it makes sense for us to do, maybe like. part session today part session on Friday kind of check back in and see where things are at because if you are going to go back to work on Monday, then that means we're no longer having sessions, like everything shuts down at that point. And that's pretty abrupt change. Are you, you know, could you go back to work and and have some session we don't know kind of what the plan is. Right, so it feels pretty. Open herky jerky."
11699.0,Patient,yeah I.
107.0,Provider,think would be a good way to manage that a little bit.
11699.0,Patient,"Well, when I was hoping, is that you know that I would hear something at least within a week of maybe be going back into work, about the Ada combinations. And i'm hoping that you know. Though maybe approved some aspect of it. Otherwise yeah."
107.0,Provider,"The way your work schedule set up right now, you wouldn't be able to do work and do I O p."
11699.0,Patient,"know. Just because. I might be able to because, so what fine I do pre authorization so but mine's. Where I take phone calls, so I have to honestly take the calls, but I did ask my boss because well if I could switch to offline which would be just me working like faxes. basis, so I could. be doing that. You know i'm possibly have group as well. I mean, I could try it and that way."
107.0,Provider,"That so. What do you what are you suggesting that you would be working in doing program at the same time, like right now i'm working on. Taxes and stuff while i'm also in group. I don't think that's gonna fly do you. I mean. Do you think your work is going to co sign that could you could you leave work early or take a break and going your car like what i'm doing and do session from your car."
11699.0,Patient,Like what kind of session like 30 minutes.
107.0,Provider,Like join group from your car like. With your phone and and do this or what like what would you be your work hours are you working till five or four.
11699.0,Patient,yeah Marika her son to play.
107.0,Provider,"Well, at the very least, I think you need to advocate for a little more time and if you if there if you find that you have to go to work full time next week, then you need to advocate to be done at three so you can go sit in your car and being session. And then, depending on when your break is if that gives you enough time to get home, so that you can join the second session from your house or something I don't know, but I think you need to really consider that because it's too abrupt. To go from I don't know I don't know too Oh, I guess i'm not doing this anymore, so at the very least, like for the next week or so for health reasons, you know, to make a transition or something I mean, not to mention you're already advocating for that, in terms of your. vertigo. stuff. Okay, so that's what i'm advocating, but again I kind of go back to now, what should we check back in on Friday and kind of see like what's the status of everything, or what do you think is a good, I mean we could certainly just do a quick check in on that, but what, how can I."
11699.0,Patient,yeah.
107.0,Provider,"Are there other things going on in life, aside from this rather large thing that's happening that we should chat about before I let you go today like is there stuff you kind of talked a lot about long last time and your frustrations and. Is everything going Okay, in terms of family dynamics or. what's happening on that front."
11699.0,Patient,"yeah i'm i'm really just. trying not to be reactive when it comes to my mom especially. Because I do I get very reactive instead of like mel's you know but. Whatever she says, is it you know how she's feeling is it I don't have control any of that stuff just it is what it is, you know. Because I know, sometimes because i'm i'm almost 100% sure my mom has an eating disorder. I mean i've never really talked to her about it or anything but. i've obviously I recognize the signs within myself so. You know. But so but still she doesn't see things how i'm starting to see them now like you know what's wrong with my little. You know my role don't make me any less of a person. kind of thing, and I think she. Again I think she just tend to project some things. But I did even point out to her before like you know just me being heavier side or having girls make be you know any less pretty. You know is that what you're bringing it up and just like, of course, not no cycle. So i'm trying to say so. But. yeah I just been getting a handle on again, you know what you told me before like i'm not responsible for. Other people's feelings and. And i'm really trying not to take responsibility for their their feelings anymore. and actually that's been a really big weightlifter to I cannot really express that to only like you know my mom but like even in my husband as well, and my and my kids and it's it almost felt like a weight was lifted off as soon as I said that."
107.0,Provider,"Okay. So kind of keep reminding yourself you're not responsible, you don't need to make it better."
11699.0,Patient,yeah.
107.0,Provider,All right. Is there anything that your husband can help you with that or is that something that you just need to do on your own in reminding with your mom and your family dynamic.
11699.0,Patient,"um yeah I mean I kind of laid it out like what specifically I would need from him and and basically I just told him I, more than anything, I just need. empathy I don't really even want sympathy, I just want to see if you're capable of that so everything that I think that I need from you right now is just the day so and and that's something also worth you know, working on with the marriage counseling and everything as well, so."
107.0,Provider,Okay. How did he respond to all of them.
11699.0,Patient,"He yeah he's he's like i'm trying to understand and. And I know. It gets hard for you know the both of us, because sometimes I would get frustrated but he's like I am taking steps to try to learn, you know about you know what you're going through and everything. So yeah."
107.0,Provider,"And you guys are doing marriage therapy once a week or. Okay, and sounds like that's going pretty well it's helpful."
11699.0,Patient,yeah yeah for sure I think hearing it from a third party is definitely helped because it's not just me saying things now yeah.
107.0,Provider,"Okay, good. I mean the mom things going to take a while it's not something that's going to happen overnight. Okay. And how are things going with the kids."
11699.0,Patient,"and The kids can be a struggle for me, sometimes too, because I could get very reactive to like if I see. That, I have to basically be the bad guy in a situation like I could get very upset about it but i'm starting to not be so reactive with that as well. And just be like okay you didn't do it well. We discussed this, we only have like several conversations about it i'm not talking about it, no more you know the deal you don't do it it's all good segue so good."
107.0,Provider,I like it you're becoming a hard ass.
11699.0,Patient,"yeah well cuz I was tired too because, like you know constantly being on my especially my eldest daughter her one job with the cat. For the most part, is to make sure the cat letters changed every day. And you know she would get mad at me like when I would take her phone away because she didn't do it one night she's like Oh well, this happened. But I told her, I was like well if you talk to me and said hey mom can I do it tomorrow, not you know i'm tired, or whatever you let me know like and we talked about it, and we agreed on something that would be different, but he didn't he just didn't do it period so."
107.0,Provider,"we're talking about five minutes or at best. yeah. I know how to even, I have to cat litter boxes, I have to get clean. So I know how long it takes."
11699.0,Patient,"I told i've told her that too, so I was like you know you can't get mad at me, you know, even if you do get mad at me fine just keep it to yourself, go to your room. But yeah that that's yeah so I was happy that I finally advocated for myself with that too."
107.0,Provider,"Good. I mean you, you have made a lot of progress, I am you know, had you had to make this decision about going back to work, a month ago, it will be much more nerve racking for me as your clinician then now I just also don't want to be like. You know everything's fine and and not just kind of give you things to think about so but I think I think you have done a ton of work. you've come a long way you're much more President you're much more connected you're just kind of in a vulnerable space, right now, and I just want to make sure that we acknowledge that and that you do what you can to kind of beef it up. So let's do this i'm thinking about my schedule i'm pretty sure I remembered it correctly, that I have. An 830 slot on Friday, are you available to touch base 830 on Friday and just let me know how things are going. Or do you think is that okay."
11699.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
107.0,Provider,"And if you don't know anything, then you don't know anything that and then we'll have to figure out what we're going to do with that point we need to. What I don't want to have happen is for you to just be like by. Like no we're going to have at least some sort of transitional thing, even if it means it's Monday night, you know at seven o'clock or something we need to have some sort of like all right, what are you going to do, how are you going to manage this what's the plan so. Okay. All right, well so unless there's something else. Is there any other big picture things I mean that's quite a bit. um let's go."
11699.0,Patient,My daughter's daughters Luke 16 is next weekend as well. So that's another reason to kind of have some additional support right.
107.0,Provider,"This weekend, or next weekend. Not this the first song yeah. yeah so yeah These are all things to think about at the very least, maybe you can advocate for some sort of preventive schedule for the next couple of weeks to kind of help you. I don't know what the what the options are but just. You know, consider all of that. Okay, so I will see you Friday at 830. Okay um and we don't need to meet for half an hour, but at least chicken and and and see how things are going. Okay, and what the plan is. Okay okay. All right, hopefully, I won't be joining from my car. But it is what it is. All right, well take care it's good to see you and I will see you on Friday morning. Okay okay. You too bye."
