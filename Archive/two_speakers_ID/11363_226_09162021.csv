226.0,Provider,hey there how's it going.
11363.0,Patient,i'm. Really excited to be meeting with you today. Oh there's my alarm to meet with you today i'm. uh. yeah I would we meet how often do we meet like once a month or something.
226.0,Provider,"yeah because you are seeing, are you still seeing an outside therapist."
11363.0,Patient,"Yes, i'm still seeing sherry um I just saw her this morning. and see here once a week, but I just I finally saw. The pain management specialist I had I had been trying to see this guy for like. years for like a couple you know, for a long time, maybe not yours, but i'm bonnie got into see him i'm. Actually kind of discouraging but you know. I guess i'm not devastated because I guess I expect these things now, which was like can't do much for you um. But I guess maybe useful to have confirmed by a specialist that a lot of this is like ptsd kind of fight or flight response related and that. I am, at least not harming myself by doing what i'm doing, and that he says, keep doing what i'm doing, which is like. acupuncture physical therapy. For he recommended specifically cognitive behavioral therapy. So I called my primary care doctor, to see if there was a way to like work the insurance company, you know, through a referral through a referral from a specialist to try and get specific cognitive behavioral therapy. cover in addition to the therapist i've invested a lot of time in four months now. I don't even know if that's possible."
226.0,Provider,hold my cat your therapist to see my tea with you.
11363.0,Patient,I don't that's not her specialty.
226.0,Provider,Is. What is for specialty.
11363.0,Patient,"I think, just like regular. Top therapy, I know I had very good luck with. You know. A you know, a specific like cognitive behavioral therapist back in. Like 2000 and for teen. You know i've been sexually assaulted the number of times, so the second to last time was a week before I got sober in 2013 i'm. On my way home from the my second mental hospitalization. They called me a cab to take me home, I was still like completely insane and not lucid and instead of driving me home the cab driver took me back to his house and."
226.0,Provider,He says Christ.
11363.0,Patient,"yeah like I was like I you know mental capacity of like a five year old at that point, I was completely. know who would be like no i'm. You know, I was. You know I went home to a house I shared with a bunch of you know, teenagers and 20 year olds and was. Convinced that I was going to be like you know basically like cowering in the corner convinced, I was going to be like crucified or something you know, I was completely. You know, whatever kind of medical term we can use for insane um and went to a dual diagnosis rehab for two months, a week later, like I wouldn't know capacity to be like a who believes a crazy person anyways like."
226.0,Provider,"Well that's the message that you sent to yourself and that's you know, and I get it like I I I understand I mean."
11363.0,Patient,I doubt i'm the first person he's done this to. Exactly okay if you're on call next to a mental hospital picking up crazy women right so. I don't know if would be possible to. yeah.
226.0,Provider,yeah. So do you work with the ptsd like your ptsd with your therapist now is that will kind of the focuses.
11363.0,Patient,"That was the whole point yeah the I was getting piecemeal therapy through the clinic where I got my primary care in psychiatry and Davis, you know, the way the insurance worked it was like. Six months on six months. Not the best, but I had a very wonderful therapist I was working with right before I moved to study you know, like when you settle in Santa Cruz, I really highly recommend you, you find someone you really like and work long term on these ptsd issues. So that's what i've prioritized doing. In therapy, but like. I do it kicking and screaming you know, like psychologically I don't want to show up for it all, you know, on a weekly basis i'd rather talk about anything else. And what my stated purpose of being there is, but you know, whatever is going on with me physiologically like it's to the you know. i'm in this like fight or flight response combination ptsd combination sheer physical pain from other systemic issues combination run down from being in constant physical pain for three years. You know the last time I was assaulted was in. In a shower bath tub combination thing, so now like i'm taking baths every night in flagrant. You know it, you know just ignoring the water restrictions at this point. and Like that hasn't been a huge problem for years that popping up in my brain. Maybe i'm lying about that because I don't shower an awful lot for a long time now, so maybe I have been avoiding it. But it's kind of ruining the. The physical therapy for the constant muscle spasm i'm in of taking a bath trying to relax to be able to go to sleep which i'm having a lot of trouble with. Because that's what pops up in my brain. When a bathtub. So. You know it's."
226.0,Provider,ever done and Dr.
11363.0,Patient,"I. Did and I think I. I either have. I was either working with someone who wasn't. Very well, who's either new to the practice. And or. I simply have or did have. Too much repressed trauma and it is not or was not a good fit for the type of. physiological relationship, I have with my trauma because it kicked off like a like a enormous like violent physiological reaction with my. ibs and intestinal problems. No one could figure out what was wrong with me at the time, there were a couple emergency room trips just. Similar to what's going on now, but manifested very differently, not the same type of pain, not the same type of eating issues i'm. A different type of you know, not a whole body problem very isolated to the intestines. But I was in school at the time, I actually prioritize staying in school because that's how I paid, you know financially that's how I paid the bills paid my rent so instead of taking care of myself like i'm desperately doing every day now at the expense of everything else. I just walked around looking like a dying person and dropped like 20 pounds in six weeks. and I don't know by the grace of God gradually started to be able to eat, again, I mean I was. Literally not eating at all for nearly two months."
226.0,Provider,"Oh, typically that does not happen with."
11363.0,Patient,"me know, otherwise it wouldn't be such an effective like. I was very incredulous about the effectiveness of this therapy, but now i'm like it works everyone like it's very effective at processing, a lot of trauma very quickly, for me, maybe not safe. I don't ever want to do it again because i'm terrified of it."
226.0,Provider,"Okay um cuz you know, obviously doing am Dr as a way of. dressing the trauma without really having to talk about it and you're not necessarily having to relive it the way you do a talk therapy, so that was why I had brought that up. The seaweed. T so tell me what you liked about it when you were doing it with your other that a while back."
11363.0,Patient,"I don't think I necessarily liked it I just know that it worked and I wasn't leaving the House, I told for about nine months and I needed to figure out how to leave the House again. and I mean, I would leave the House for like an A meeting once a week to go to therapy. that's pretty much it. I didn't even want to like get them, you know I would avoid getting the mail taking out the trash. Like I just you know. And I feel I mean encoded like I can kind of I don't really ever go outside much now, but like that the the panic imperative is not. As like duck and cover like absolutely must not leave i'm just like I prefer not to leave Santa Cruz feels like a pretty hostile place like and I don't have to because it's like coven and like. The CDC says like don't be around people, so how handy. You know, but I don't know anyone in this entire city, and I have lots of. You know, I have a giant community on a zoom I have my friends, I have lovely conversations with them on the phone. You know. i'm I can. isolate without. A lot of them many you know. A lot of the mental. pitfalls of isolating, I guess, and I know it's still bad, but i'm not doing the worst of the harmful isolation of depression that i'm so familiar with. So. In a way, it's like a kindness and the way it's like a crutch but it's like i'm doing the best I can right now, without like. molding in a pit of depression, I guess. feels very hostile and scary and I feel very raw and vulnerable and just like standing in line at CBS it's like i'm bombarded with like the anger and anxiety and impatience of like the asshole standing in line glaring at the. Poor cash register people because CBS is understaffed and like understandably so, because, like who wants to work at CVs and a pandemic like i'm just like I don't want to be like it's too much. So yeah."
226.0,Provider,I told you to recommend the severity.
11363.0,Patient,The pain management specialist.
226.0,Provider,But.
11363.0,Patient,I don't really know the difference between. cognitive and diet dialectical I think is the other one.
226.0,Provider,"yeah I gave me today. Are you doing, are you doing dude booty with your therapist."
11363.0,Patient,"Not that i'm aware of at least I don't really know the difference, but my other friend who has. come a long way with her. rabid ptsd issues. speaks very highly of DDT."
226.0,Provider,"db T. You know db T is a lot of like mindfulness and. Like DVDs are very different modality than cvt you know cvt is really about being able to identify your emotions. You know, to get in touch with your emotions. Is this accurate thinking you know, is this really like reality based thinking and changing negative thoughts positive thoughts. there's you know if you follow the cpt protocol, you know there's a lot of homework there's a lot of writing, you know that kind of stuff."
11363.0,Patient,"So we do do twice, you know the the eight, I guess, we would call it the a model or the a practice I followed we do twice daily writing already so maybe dialectical would be. I don't like I don't know, but I did get on the beacon website and print out, you know local and tele health provider list. For people who specialize in db T cvt and ptsd."
226.0,Provider,"I mean, do you like the therapists are working with."
11363.0,Patient,really do I really do but. Having also have. You know that very specific and effective results and kind of similar situation. um.
226.0,Provider,"Have you okay so here's my suggestion is I would, I would ask your therapist that you're working with her, she can do save me too. yeah because it's really difficult to struggle over with a new therapist you know, like."
11363.0,Patient,I kind of want my cake and eat it too late.
226.0,Provider,"So it's it's sort of like when somebody says oh yeah I different modality you're gonna think oh wow Okay, then that's going to really take care of all my problems, you know, like all do this that's not necessarily true there's a lot more. disruption in starting with somebody new, especially if you'd like your therapist. to know like if you already have that established. Therapeutic relationship, you have that trust she's got the background I don't know how beneficial, it would be to start with another therapist, to be honest with you and I don't know that insurance going to cover the therapists it is cvt versus their procedures, etc."
11363.0,Patient,"I feel really safe with her and i'm inclined to listen to your advice. I think the only way. I would do another therapist if it's if I could somehow add them on by some work in insurance or someone who would do like a massively sliding scale. You know, with a specific goal in mind that could have like an identified and point like we've established this goal. Now we because, like when I did see it before like there was a measurable like endpoint they're like Okay, you know, it was a nonprofit that I got for free in Los Angeles, they were like we've achieved our goal now by and i'm like on damn."
226.0,Provider,Right. yeah they were probably that could have been under a grant to because usually if you're under a grant there's. You know there's an end date.
11363.0,Patient,yeah I was really impressed I mean some of the best services have gotten have been through like Community clinics.
226.0,Provider,yeah.
11363.0,Patient,For some reason that was unexpected to me but.
226.0,Provider,"They might. be impressed yeah. yeah, and so my I, at least for right now, I think you should just stay with with with therapists that you have right now and just continue to work on the ptsd end of it, because you know ptsd. Okay, so that fight or flight, you know in that's in the amygdala in the brain I. mean if you're always in you know fight or flight mode, you know your dreams are drained you're on hyper alert you're just always like on edge. So that, obviously, as you know, has an effect on your body physically and so those emotions are manifested semantically like in your that ptsd has manifested itself in your body it's parked itself in your body."
11363.0,Patient,"yeah I googled I just you know I haven't been having trouble sleeping and wake up a couple times and I often. having to do like stretches because, like my whole body hurts because i'm so like everything, so my muscles are so tight. But i've skipped a period for the first time in my life and I Google that and it mentioned the amygdala the same thing you just mentioned, so I think my body so stressed out. I even have a period."
226.0,Provider,i'm to meditate.
11363.0,Patient,"And yeah i've been meditating for. I think about exactly two years now, but it only kind of. clicked about two months ago um I think I i've been my I think my body's been too fucked up to be able to like I haven't been able to actually reach a meditative state until about two months ago. I don't know how I stuck with it, it was really frustrating for two years to just sit there and I basically now I realized I just sat there and disassociated for two years, as opposed to meditate so."
226.0,Provider,"it's okay it's a practice it's Okay, I think you're you're getting the benefits to just stay realize it it's okay there's no right or wrong."
11363.0,Patient,"With it, it feels wonderful now like that I actually reached the meditative state, and I think it's, the only way i'm surviving what i'm doing right now, because I can mindfully get my body to relax That is how I get my whole body too intense to untie tense, but it really tenses up. yeah 10 1520 minutes after i'm done meditating."
226.0,Provider,"And, have you ever heard of anything called reiki like energy work."
11363.0,Patient,Similar to em Dr and like. You said right is very different.
226.0,Provider,"Right he's not not and Dr right if you find somebody that's really good at writing it's like moving the energy through your body so everything is energy we just don't know what our bodies are energy there's energy swirling going all around us. But we don't see it. So just because of like you know different vibrations dimensions all of that kind of stuff the reiki like actually will move, so our bodies have our Chakra centers right. centers or chakras centers get blocked yeah and so you want to clear these shut your Chakra centers just because it really keeps you vibrant and clear and energy, you know peak energy, energy and all that stuff um. So I don't know if I mean if I were you, I would just kind of research it and see if it sounds like something that would be of interest to you. i'm sure there's a ton of really good reiki therapist where you are, and you know just have a session and it's just basically just kind of line there and they just kind of like you know it's just it's just a way it's it's just another tool lauren like it's just something else."
11363.0,Patient,"cool um. They might get noisy. Sorry, please continue."
226.0,Provider,"So it's just another it's just another tool that you can you know, look into into it's not going to harm you and you know it's it's relaxing."
11363.0,Patient,"and recommend any way, is there any like certification or way to make sure that you know you're seeing like someone who's really good versus someone who might be like total crap or."
226.0,Provider,"I would look and just see somebody that has been doing it for a while. yeah and that. And kind of tell by their vibe their website and have a conversation with them, I would recommend that. If you're interested just have 15 minute consultation and say here's my situation is so big it helped me when. You know before you make an. Appointment spend the money and go oh that's. You know so it's just really about, you know, maybe asking around calling that kinda."
11363.0,Patient,"yeah, how do you spell it."
226.0,Provider,"it's R E I OK, I."
11363.0,Patient,OK.
226.0,Provider,I don't know yeah i'm just throwing everything as.
11363.0,Patient,You know i've changed the way I eat. yeah i've changed the way I sleep. i've changed the way I dress so like everything's like loose and comfortable and not stressing my body out. yeah i'm like getting different products that are like.
226.0,Provider,That.
11363.0,Patient,"Better you know, like."
226.0,Provider,Totally so it's it's like it's about like a wellness program like you want to have a wellness program where you know there's these there's not like there's the clinical side medical side and then there's more of like the holistic natural pathak side it's.
11363.0,Patient,Organic food.
226.0,Provider,"Is. You know, absolutely you know. there's. colon therapist right the acupuncture. You know all of these holistic treatments massage that point doesn't sound great to hear. That."
11363.0,Patient,"i'm afraid to. Start Up you know within muscles, maybe later when things kind of calm down, it might be a good like maintenance thing. Pro doing all kinds of research into like BIOME and probiotics because. You know, I was born three months early and I imagine there's a lot of trauma around like. not getting all the early. yeah immune system stuff like just you know."
226.0,Provider,"there's also. neurofeedback you know. You know there's just it's you just gotta you gotta find you know you research it and you go oh that might work or you know, yes or no, whatever it's just you constantly are searching for something that will give you relief and you'll find that. You know you will find it but being open to these other these other ways of treating your trauma because trauma is not just treated through medication and therapy right through. She gong meditation people do yoga."
11363.0,Patient,"People have a friend who's a personal trainer who's offered to help me but i'm like two week now even like a walk around the block, so I need to like build up some basic. strength, before I would even. get into like what's deliberately deplete my energy on purpose."
226.0,Provider,Like right exactly yeah yeah so there's there's these different things that you can that you can look into and I think it's worth your while to do that.
11363.0,Patient,"yeah. Thank you, I I. it's just it's really overwhelming sometimes. Ask. Really discouraging sometimes because i've done. Like I am do like compared to a month ago I like i'm no longer go to bed weeping with exhaustion so like."
226.0,Provider,"And today, like you're like you're up and you're sitting, you know, during groups you've been I know in bed just kind of leaning up yeah, so this is progress, the fact that you. You know. So you need to count these victories."
11363.0,Patient,I bought myself a chair like an actual comfortable like. Spending $125 on a chair. Right that's insane. But like. I need like a chair that's like good for my body and not like a $7 falling apart piece of shit from the thrift store. That doesn't hurt me and to sit in and might collapse at any moment.
226.0,Provider,"yeah so you know I want you to count the. small victories, I mean These are big victories actually okay so let's do this like I think how we had it is we're doing it once a month does that sound."
11363.0,Patient,"Familiar right, I think that is what we were doing."
226.0,Provider,"Okay, so does that sound about that sounds good for you."
11363.0,Patient,mm hmm.
226.0,Provider,"Okay, so let's do October 14 do you want to do 11 o'clock."
11363.0,Patient,October 14 11 o'clock. Do you have something a little later. I just would like a little bit of a break between my regular therapy appointment. And you.
226.0,Provider,"Do you want to do, like a 130 or two."
11363.0,Patient,130 would be perfect.
226.0,Provider,"Okay i'm going to put you in for that day, and then, if you need to talk to me before then you can always call the virtual clinic."
11363.0,Patient,"cool Thank you. yeah and just so you know, I was on hold with a compliance before our appointment because. I was able to renew a really wonderful volunteer position earlier today, but it does conflict with the new group therapy thing I arranged with shauntel. Okay, unfortunately, so I was. You know, on hold with them, trying to arrange a new group therapy again, unfortunately."
226.0,Provider,Okay.
11363.0,Patient,"So I don't know what my options are but I ran out of time. In order to make this appointment, so I will call them back. i'm hoping for another coed option, because I, which I was horrified at first, but I think it's actually good for me to like learn that, like men have feelings to her."
226.0,Provider,"I agree, I think that's a. Great way of looking at it yeah you know it just brings in a different perspective."
11363.0,Patient,"I think that's actually incredibly good for me, but at first, I was like."
226.0,Provider,"yeah yeah. Okay, so what I would recommend is yeah get back with a virtual clinic."
11363.0,Patient,and try and get that worked out and then i'll just plan on seeing you in like a month. yeah all right.
226.0,Provider,"Okay well. yeah it was great seeing you on you, you know you're I love that you're sitting up by, though, that we were able to meet and so we'll just plan meeting once a month."
11363.0,Patient,"yeah and I really. You know, step by step, so now, I have the reiki to research neurofeedback the research and i've got time to do it because it's like a month until I get to see the next round of specialist so happy."
226.0,Provider,Friday Thank you take care.
