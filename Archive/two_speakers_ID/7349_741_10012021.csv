He will not say that he's an addict though he drinks and drives every night. yeah but he hated me when I was not acting like thinks i'm terrible and i'm like you're just as bad."
741.0,Provider,"Well, usually it's real easy for them to point the finger at someone else."
7349.0,Patient,mm hmm.

741.0,Provider,voices.
7349.0,Patient,"Work Okay, he used to work. He used to be the worker he did tile but then he hurt his back, hence why he's on pain pills. And forgot my train of thought. So she works now she works at united, healthcare and he he literally like runs around and hangs out with his friends all day. and spend her money it's like keep it like they go to Reno they drive three hours one one day, every weekend and three hours back and he gambled because he says he wins money but it's like no."
741.0,Provider,losing all the money.
7349.0,Patient,"Like in show even be like oh like can we stay one night no wonder, like nothing she wants to do is ever an option ever yeah I know. it's hard. To give her advice, but at the same time i'm like I don't want to hear it again like i'm always in the middle of it."
741.0,Provider,"Well, sounds like you probably need to set boundaries."
7349.0,Patient,"I try to yeah we work on it it's hard, though."
741.0,Provider,Because I know it's hard because she's your mom.
7349.0,Patient,"me like he doesn't let her have anyone else, she has history as well, so I don't know its. nose say he."
741.0,Provider,"Well, it might be helpful to her if you manage to set boundaries and say i'm willing to do this, but you have to do this, this, and this, otherwise I can't help you. You know. Because it may be helpful for her in the long run."
7349.0,Patient,"I just don't know it's like what. he's so good at manipulating like he he hates that me and her close, I would go shopping when I was younger he would be calling her after a half hour freaking out, we would be shopping."

7349.0,Patient,So fucking it's so fucked up like.
741.0,Provider,yeah it sounds like you're both the lesson.
7349.0,Patient,"he hates me because we're and he, like resents me and kind of resents colson. And he thinks i'm like part of it, like scheming like we just hate him and Baba and it's like no I make sure to tell him I love him i'm always nice to him, the other day. So he is like never nice to me, I went up there, it when they were fighting and he was so nice to me because they were fighting and it pissed me off because i'm like I know you're just being this way to spite her and to show her like hey I am nice to her, you know. so nice so nice I was like that's bullshit though that was all."
741.0,Provider,Not real it was like not real and. It felt.
7349.0,Patient,"Like i've been asked him to show me how to wax my car for like a year. And you. yeah like bring it up, I have a wax machine all that you use he has never said that in the many times I have asked him to show me how to wax my car."

7349.0,Patient,"yeah well she just asked her base, you know and it's."
741.0,Provider,But then she doesn't take it.
7349.0,Patient,yeah that's true.
741.0,Provider,So if she's gonna ask her advice. There must be some kind of stipulation if you want my advice.
7349.0,Patient,mm hmm.
741.0,Provider,Then you have to do at least one thing I suggest otherwise i'm not going to give it to you.
7349.0,Patient,yeah that's true.
741.0,Provider,that's a waste of my time and energy.
7349.0,Patient,jack's I worry about a lot.

7349.0,Patient,"yeah and he kept his back is so bad, he did not do very well in del."
741.0,Provider,mar but maybe that's what needs to happen for him to get a wake up call.
7349.0,Patient,"I know right I don't want to wish that on anybody, but you know."
741.0,Provider,"No, but I mean seriously."
7349.0,Patient,yeah it's pretty and he just he hated me for partying and everything and it's like you're no better we drove down all together to my grandma because he couldn't even make it all the way home he had to stop and get beer and I was so pissed like.

7349.0,Patient,Oh yeah but uh.
741.0,Provider,"huh. it's Okay, I have a boundary to say that my child and I are not in the car when you're driving."

741.0,Provider,"Well that's fine, but your your health well being and safety and the safety and well being of your child are more important than his mouth."
7349.0,Patient,yeah he doesn't he doesn't care he didn't give a shit.

7349.0,Patient,yeah it's just it's like what does he care about he says he loves my mom but that's not love.

741.0,Provider,Right this alcohol and drugs.
7349.0,Patient,"yeah pills pills make you mean I remember i'm not stupid, I used to mix them all."

741.0,Provider,"Well, but your mom's an adult and if she wants to volunteer for that kind of stuff then that's her prerogative. But. I just get i'm gonna figure out how to disconnect from that. and realize that. that's her stuff that's not yours."
7349.0,Patient,He hasn't what her how did you want else forever.

7349.0,Patient,I know.
741.0,Provider,"And I know she's your mom somewhere along the way. you're gonna have to figure out how to so that it doesn't affect you, to the point that. You know you're upset about it."
7349.0,Patient,yeah super fun. Oh.
741.0,Provider,that's kind of what I what i'm getting that really is just that you know that it really does affect you because you've spent the last 30 minutes talking about it.
7349.0,Patient,I know I know I see another counselor regularly to and not generally.
741.0,Provider,"Do you want to keep talking about it, or do you want to change it."
7349.0,Patient,"Well, I wish, she would leave or do something."
741.0,Provider,"yeah, but you have no control over her all you have control over is you."
7349.0,Patient,yeah.
741.0,Provider,And even then half the time you don't have control over you either.
7349.0,Patient,"No, I just take it as it comes. You take the."
741.0,Provider,"All right, i'm gonna share my screen here."
7349.0,Patient,"Okay, can I run to the bathroom."
741.0,Provider,"Yes, you can."
7349.0,Patient,Sorry.
741.0,Provider,"that's all right. Okay, so this little worksheet. um what does read it Okay, in addition to external pressures to use our attitudes thoughts and behaviors play a key role and relapse learning about early warning signs can help us avoid going back to drinking using or other addictive patterns. And this exercise will help you identify your early warning signs stop the relapse process and turn it around before you pick up a drink or drug or return to another addictive behavior. When a person picks up a drink or a drug locks into a casino or otherwise turn returns to an addiction that's the completion of the relapse process, not its beginning. before that happens, there are many warning signs knowing what those warning signs are can help you cut the process short and stay in recovery. So relapse related changes and drink and thinking include persuading yourself that some new method of control drinking drug use or gambling will work. i'm remembering the good times and overlooking the problems, thinking of addictive actions as a reward for success or a way to celebrate and or believing that one can succeed cannot succeed in recovery. So what are some of the specific examples of how you're thinking changed before your last relapse or similar changes that you've seen in other."
7349.0,Patient,So I have not relapse since I got clean. Right after I had colson. Okay.
741.0,Provider,Times prior to that how many times have you tried to stop but not been successful. yeah so think about those those times. Where. What was the thought.
7349.0,Patient,"i'd never really like. Like I would kind of run out of stuff. or be like. No, I never like fully committed to. start a all that time. But I guess kind of just feeling like. I can't do this like. mm hmm yeah."
741.0,Provider,"Like you can't succeed. used to add, how do you celebrate. When I was out there, doing that. lesson I did celebrating no. No my famous thought was just one and nobody will know. yeah, which was the biggest lie ever told myself or anyone."
7349.0,Patient,it's never just one.
741.0,Provider,there's never i've never done one in my. entire life. yeah yeah. The minute that I do something somebody else nope.
7349.0,Patient,yeah.
741.0,Provider,My mom I get to blown away. For me to hide anything. You know it never it. Just baffles me even today. That people who use think people who don't use don't know.
7349.0,Patient,yeah.
741.0,Provider,Why do you think that that pinpoint I eyeballs or half mass eyeballs or. The wobbling we don't know this.
7349.0,Patient,yeah cuz you don't realize you're doing it.
741.0,Provider,Right. At least I know you're confronted on it on a regular basis.
7349.0,Patient,I don't know.
741.0,Provider,it's confusing to me now.
7349.0,Patient,Is.
741.0,Provider,Why we don't comprehend my fat that you know people know.
7349.0,Patient,mm hmm.
741.0,Provider,They know what we're doing.
7349.0,Patient,yeah you know we're doing something.
741.0,Provider,"yeah they know we're not acting normal. That we can't be trusted you know it's just it's just really obvious. And so, emotions and attitudes also change as a person, dressed toward relapse. Determination optimism teamwork and motivation may be replaced by forms of negativity such as apathy selfishness and a feeling that, being unable to join us or gamble on is i'm an undeserved punishment. man. that's Nice. i'm sorry."
7349.0,Patient,yeah they get like mad and like what's the word. Like kind of like argue. feel defensive.
741.0,Provider,Right right and notice that people who use sound hang around people who don't use because.
7349.0,Patient,Because they don't think uncomfortable yeah and then the people who are clean.
741.0,Provider,"don't don't want to be around it. Right. So what kind of emotions or attitudes. um Do you remember having while you were out there, using."
7349.0,Patient,"A defensive totally. Okay, were you saying i'm using."
741.0,Provider,"I was, I was, I was lazy."
7349.0,Patient,"I, like my thyroid slow, so I normally i'm really tired, but then it was like I would just."
741.0,Provider,"yeah. yeah nodded. huh um. My drugs of choice for heroin and cocaine, I was awakening. nod. I was a mass I didn't know if I was coming or going. So."
7349.0,Patient,"Okay, a lot with a boyfriend before my pills were always my favorite thing always. hmm narcos or oxy or whatever. But i've always been like a party or so, with my ex religion coke every weekend and he was like a rich kid like he would have never heard that he was an addict to buy."
741.0,Provider,Right exactly. yeah yeah and sometimes people with money. It takes them longer to hit bottom.
7349.0,Patient,yeah oh yeah. Bob he I mean he didn't get to the point of like using when he would go to work yeah he would just do it on weekends weekend would hit and you would already have a bag and.
741.0,Provider,yeah but he was headed that way.
7349.0,Patient,"I wonder, and now where he's on. him when the fenton all started getting mixed i'm like he better stop or he's gonna die. scary."
741.0,Provider,"Yes, so another area where there are clear differences between actively attic. lifestyle and that of a recovering person is how you relate to others so before going. When you're an active addiction. What did you do, did you self isolate did you manipulate where you dishonest or secretive."
7349.0,Patient,"Oh yeah. I would leave all the time at all hours tonight, what are you going to store."
741.0,Provider,dishonest secretive yeah I was always. I would go and get my stuff and then try to try to hide. yeah I didn't want to share with. I wanted to be alone.
7349.0,Patient,yeah I was. To anyways so.
741.0,Provider,yeah So if you found yourself isolating or becoming very secretive and dishonest. Would that be a red flag that you might be headed somewhere you don't really want to go.
7349.0,Patient,I don't know if that would happen until I did it.
741.0,Provider,Okay.
7349.0,Patient,Because I mean I wouldn't.
741.0,Provider,venture to say that you start becoming dishonest. And I slipped him. Before you do it.
7349.0,Patient,I just don't like what I lie about before is what a.
741.0,Provider,"um you'd be surprised. yeah you wouldn't really be surprised um people start lying about stupid stuff. Before they use it doesn't make sense. or not. But it starts happening long before they ever actually do the the. yeah i'm. Just like you become angry and resentful beforehand, maybe i'm. Those types of things just we just can't afford to do it."
7349.0,Patient,So it's like you know you're going to do it almost and you already are like.
741.0,Provider,you're already setting yourself up.
7349.0,Patient,yeah you're like don't talk to me don't.
741.0,Provider,mm hmm and you don't shut down like nobody talking out of it.
7349.0,Patient,yeah because you already made your mind oh.
741.0,Provider,"um you've also seen a common behavior patterns in yourself or others who are abusing alcohol or other drugs and. and seeing very different patterns and we're covering people when a person is sliding back toward addiction his or her behavior starts looking more and more like it did before recovery. Some typical addictive behavior patterns include irregular eating and sleeping habits. and neglecting your health. and irresponsibility like becoming really irresponsible and missing appointments. And things like that procrastinating on doing stuff that you need to do. Making really. impulsive or reckless decisions. and other power patterns of showing a loss of self control and then chaos kind of gross. um. I i'm trying to remember some of the habits, I know. If i'm up in the middle of the night."
7349.0,Patient,yeah.
741.0,Provider,And not sleeping. i'm either in a lot of pain or i'm headed for relapse one of the two.
7349.0,Patient,yeah that makes sense.
741.0,Provider,And if I start getting real impulsive and reckless. With my decisions and my behavior. Then yeah there's something up.
7349.0,Patient,"yeah like some decisions with money, or like. mm hmm yeah not not taking care of like your responsibilities."
741.0,Provider,yeah like not paying the bills.
7349.0,Patient,yeah yeah yeah yeah.
741.0,Provider,So those things those things happen.
7349.0,Patient,Not cleaning maybe as much as you want just not. about things.
741.0,Provider,Right not taking care of your own personal hygiene.
7349.0,Patient,yeah.
741.0,Provider,"yeah so and, together with other changes, like those described a bad feelings and moods of actively addicted people tend to be different from those they experienced and recovery. addictive patterns of feelings and mood irritability Nx anxiety depression hopelessness and different self pity anger and self centeredness. I think the ones that stand out the most are irritability hopelessness self pity and anger. yeah those are the ones that usually if I see somebody asked him like that i'm concerned."
7349.0,Patient,I.
741.0,Provider,There they're either using or they're headed back toward it.
7349.0,Patient,"I got kind of like I got really depressed the past. It was just really hard for me to handle everything. Like What was really hard and then colson was being difficult, so I I was just being really agitated I don't think that meant I was going to use I just I kind of get that, from my dad was always agitated when I grew up, so I kind of have to like put myself in check."
741.0,Provider,When it. came to get agitated or irritated.
7349.0,Patient,mm hmm.
741.0,Provider,But if you don't deal with it like if you ignore it. yeah then it can continue and to grow into an issue that could lead you back to handling things differently.
7349.0,Patient,"Oh, that your credibility of taking pills was like way different than anything I could. not make Brian, but it was terrible."
741.0,Provider,But so you can see where some of these things. can indicate.
7349.0,Patient,Issues oh yeah. yeah totally.
741.0,Provider,"And then think back check with others, identify whatever warning signs from the areas above that you are other saw you before the last time you used to not necessarily relapse but before us, and if you've ever tried to quit before. and have no experience of relapse. And list the main patterns that when normal for you, when you were drinking or using. Either way right the red flags down and typically in the order that they happened if you can remember them. because those are going to be indicators. For i'm. warning signs. yeah and if we have the warning signs written down. We can create a strategy to headed off at the pass. yeah you know if we actually can write it down. and be able to look at it, we can create a system so that we can intercept before we actually use. Because like that, like this, people are said actually using is the end of the process, nothing beginning."
7349.0,Patient,yeah that makes.
741.0,Provider,So.
7349.0,Patient,"I think like. When I when I would like to withdraw, I would like you said I would be up all night and then I would get up really early and go try to find whatever. That is like if i'm up in unusually early. Because I like to sleep. I like to refer."
741.0,Provider,"Even like a morning person and I wake up early anyway guys. For you, that would be an indication that something's up."
7349.0,Patient,yeah totally yeah i'm up super early. Before 830 unless I might or something.
741.0,Provider,"Right right. Alright, so we've gone over this, but I would like to email it to you so that you can think about it and write down some answers for this, so that we can continue toward making a relapse prevention plan. Okay cuz I really. you're headed in the right direction and I really want you to have a plan so that when things when you get overwhelmed when things get really intense, you have a way of. Handling those things without using and without reverting to your old behavior. Okay. yeah alright so i'm going to send this i'm going to stop the share and i'm going to email it to you. Okay, and. I guess i'll see you next time in group."
7349.0,Patient,Okay.
741.0,Provider,All right here.
7349.0,Patient,You tell. i'm going to go the doctor now. Okay bye.
