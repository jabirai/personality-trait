And I can't remember the medications that they had me on either I just know that i've been on amitriptyline north or blue and i've been on a lot of different ones that want."

12799.0,Patient,Okay yeah that sounds good.
191.0,Provider,sounds right you do any schizophrenia personality disorder or anything.
12799.0,Patient,"No a bipolar yes, when I was in my 20s they they I had, I had a diagnosis of bipolar. But. And I was a you know, in recent years I was, I was treated with. God lamotrigine."
191.0,Provider,uh huh.
12799.0,Patient,"yeah for moods and stuff now. it's hard to say honestly Dr cell because. I was off the hook, I mean. Okay got the chain i've done a lot of. i've done a lot of work on myself over the years. Since I was like 30 even though i've been active in my drug addiction. i've done a lot of work, because I just didn't feel like the medications or anything were helping and so through that work i've i've gotten like my temper under control i've gotten my moods a lot more under control. You know so i'm not so off the hook, you know bipolar if you will um."
191.0,Provider,Did you did you agree with that bipolar diagnosis.
12799.0,Patient,I did at the time.
191.0,Provider,Were you on drugs when they gave you that diagnosis.
12799.0,Patient,"Yes, I was. Okay, so i've been on drugs, most of you know, the time through, and so you know that that might be a lot of why you know, maybe a lot of drugs didn't work for me I don't know. But it's like even now, you know I i've had doctors tell me that they don't think i'm bipolar you know doctors that know me now that didn't know me then. So I mean it's it's it's just hard saying and now i'm not on drugs and I just knew that you know the ptsd was a later diagnosis on after my father's untimely and tragic death, I saw. An image that I just didn't want to see, but it really set off some ptsd and and the doctor did make the comment that he feels I have. suffered ptsd probably way back when I was a little child because of all the things that have happened to me and. And it's just now, it was just then coming out in oh six because of the accident on because that's that's when nightmares and that's when you know just all that really kicked in. So that that definitely is is a is a accurate diagnosis and the depression, I knew would come back. By by quitting the drugs, I was really concerned about my depression coming back and being active and it has. I have you know i'm very it's so hard because i'm very i'm very. What is it. Recovery oriented i'm really excited. about my theory and."
191.0,Provider,And I think it's so beautiful too.
12799.0,Patient,"Well, thank you and it's so hard, because I wake up and it's like just getting going is so hard to do being excited for my day is really hard to do. And it's just."
191.0,Provider,That kind of sounds like some of the.
12799.0,Patient,freshman yeah.
191.0,Provider,"it's a bummer me, let me back up quickly I don't mean to interrupt but I know we have 30 minutes and I gotta get know which madison's we're going to look at your genealogy together."
12799.0,Patient,Absolutely cool.
191.0,Provider,"Okay, so what i'm hearing is that depression, has been the chronic and it sounds like you still have some signs and symptoms of depression now. yeah Okay, the bipolar is not uncommon for bipolar is as they get older kind of mellows off that you know, out of mellows a little bit and we've we've noticed that."
12799.0,Patient,Okay okay mom and then.
191.0,Provider,"it's hard to make a diagnosis if you're doing drugs, it sounds like the chronic consistent diagnosis has been the major depression. all the way from age 14. All the way to 17 when did you start your drug use."
12799.0,Patient,"And my my drug use, I very first started smoking pot, when I was 13 can, and I have been using drugs my whole life. And i've only quit for like when I was pregnant both times I quit. But I had no desire to stop doing drugs at any time, unless I absolutely had to. And, and you know, a couple times I absolutely had you but yeah I think that I haven't given any treatment in a chance, really, because I was using drugs, at the same time, but. I also have no desire in being sedated I can do that myself and I can't function and the drugs that they were putting me on and we're doing that. And, and therefore I had no interest in continuing. Any treatment because I didn't like how it was making me feel and like this last time, if you will. When we did the genealogy test she put me on the lamotrigine and I was having some serious anxiety like I do now, I do have anxiety moments and. So she put I can't remember she put me on an anxiety medication as well, and when I went in and told her. That I was feeling sedated and I didn't like it her answer to that was to add a another anxiety medication to already the anxiety medication and the emotion, so I threw the medications away and I quit taking them, so you know yeah."
191.0,Provider,"we're gonna we're gonna look at your list i'm gonna get we're gonna go over that, let me look at this right now but we're gonna get a very detailed list because I want to get an understanding of the class medicines you've been all that are not effective so. We can look at the genealogy but then we can look at the class at a type of the medicines in the ones that are sedating and I know i've had patients who are very sensitive to sedation. In it, even if it doesn't make the average person sleep it and make them sleepy so and I do want you to journal whenever we do this medicine, I want you to do a journal, even if it's like a calendar. And I want you to check for your mood. hasn't make you feel, and I want you to check for your fatigue. And I want you to look at your motivation. And I want you to look at some physical symptoms to like does it make you nauseous does it make you dizzy we're going to. Go get. Some more but we're going to write that down, and when you and I want you to so we can get some objective parameters on if something is working or not okay. Let me ask you these questions, because this is something objective, so you did some surveys to look at in depth Depression and anxiety, so the pH Q nine. So these are the samples of the questions from your PhD you know, over the last two weeks How often have you been bothered by any of the following problems little interest or pleasure and doing things you said several days. feeling down and depressed or whole for several days trouble falling asleep staying asleep a stupid too much several days. yeah I want to sleep all the time."
12799.0,Patient,"yeah it's like I need it's like my sleep is not interrupted, I went to sleep all the time it's like the mind that there. I can't function without. 12 to 14 hours of sleep. I don't know if you had your thyroid checked. Yes, um and I am now on a thyroid medications you said, my thyroid was a little bit low. So I take leave oh yeah."
191.0,Provider,"Okay, and that was."
12799.0,Patient,"That was about almost probably three months ago, and so i've been on that and I just came from the doctor, where I, but their their their phlebotomist was not in. So, and he couldn't do my blood, so I can wait. yeah and they're respecting that along."
191.0,Provider,we're gonna keep going i'm going to redirect you so i'm sorry it's going to sound like i'm. interrupting you you're. not trying to be rude.

191.0,Provider,And that's interesting that you define yourself as passive because you don't come across like dating group at all.
12799.0,Patient,Well i'm just trying to feel i'm trying to. model your.
191.0,Provider,"Your score was a mount depression, it was a score of eight, do you agree with that or not."
12799.0,Patient,um maybe yeah. I mean i'm not. i'm not so sure it's really depressed that I I can't function like i'm forcing myself to get up and do what I have to do. Okay now.

And we're going to keep building on that Okay, I know we got to get through the medicines that you can take them wow. Get seven is anxiety. And you have a score of a seven and that puts out about a moderate mild to moderate anxiety."

191.0,Provider,Like pain.
12799.0,Patient,yeah yeah I get some sciatica.
191.0,Provider,"Because the thing is this the nortriptyline helps with the depression and i've had people that family medicine, it also helps with depression nortriptyline is not asked a date and as amitriptyline and that's why they switched you. And so it can give you the pain control that you're mad at you know, take a little edge off of the pain okay."
12799.0,Patient,mm hmm.
191.0,Provider,"So that's definitely one thing, and now, some of these other medicines like it looked like of eliza don't you've not tried and that's a definitely a. Option there but you've and but the thing is to when you start looking at those medicines, even though it's on your list, we have to look to see if your insurance company is going to cover. Here Okay, because. The thing is, is that we've not um. You know, sometimes if they don't you know they're newer madison's they look like it's going to work for you, but it's a newer medicine may not be covered okay. yeah."
12799.0,Patient,"Right, especially I have stayed insurance, so I have a mirror group through apple health. So yeah."
191.0,Provider,chances are they they're not going to cover the newer. mm hmm.
12799.0,Patient,"I know that they would probably definitely cover wellbutrin that's a common one, or they would."
191.0,Provider,"yeah and and you know, the thing about the realize it down. Is that. It may actually give you a little bit of energy to okay. So it's like so. Many of the other is gone to help with the release of serotonin and that's one of the things that help move. And so that can be one of the things that may actually be able to help okay. Now, the thing about the vibrate that I do like is it's sort of like a it's like a serotonin selective serotonin and also a norepinephrine re uptake inhibitor. And that's where it's going to give you should give you a little bit of energy OK, so the thing that I, you know we're we're kind of looking at which wants to take. This one may give you the energy that you want, but still potentially do with the pressure so we're trying to look like one of the main things of your depression is this chronic fatigue fatigue. Okay now interestingly, they tried that they tried to do that with like the cymbalta and they tried to do that with the effects are and that those types of medicines didn't work for you, so we want to look at this. To see if it can actually help a little better and function, a little differently from those what."
12799.0,Patient,"About Okay, and I hear like a lot about like. The the enhancers the you know you take you to even see the commercials and i've heard it from other people to that they're taking this one, with their their energy President what it, what do you think about those that kind of stuff."
191.0,Provider,"yeah so like the add ons Okay, so I know that there are several add ons that people can potentially do so usually what I do I start with a baseline one that's going to give you two good serotonin coverage ssri Snr artists, which you do can help with anxiety and depression okay. So let's say if you still have really bad depression, then you know if we can increase what you start with see how that works, and then we may end up at adding like an abilify sometimes that really helps people okay. Sarah curl is extremely sedate so wouldn't add no."
12799.0,Patient,I don't like the idea circle at all that's like a sleep medicine i've seen people sorry.
191.0,Provider,"Drug. But a lot of people start high dose with that they start high dose with that and I don't so this type of medicine on. It you know it may actually help some somebody medicines in general may help with the fatigue Okay, so this is one of the ones that seems like it's a pretty helpful with that one okay. yeah."
12799.0,Patient,"yeah cuz I definitely I definitely need way too much sleep. And you know I know that i'm on methadone i'm well i'm only on 90 milligrams of methadone and I have been for nine months now. Will 90 milligrams for like eight or seven months, and so I don't I don't like not or anything as a matter of fact, I probably could even go up, but no i'm interested in just. i'm gonna i'm going to be checking into just what where I have to get down to so I can just check in and detox off of it all together. I don't even like being on methadone and I don't like the company, I have to go through to do it so i'm going to be looking into that and I don't want to be on it at all. And then, if I have to at some point, and you know, maybe get on suboxone or something so that I can still control my cravings and i'm going to try not to have to be on anything you know. But um yeah so I just want you to know that that's that's something but i'll keep you posted on that. But yeah I definitely so yeah the energy is a big deal and the sleep is is huge I don't need help sleeping I need I need help, not needing to sleep so much and and then yeah the just the depressive mood. yeah okay."
191.0,Provider,"You may see you may have. You may have possibly a lower weight gain. less of a. weight gain okay all right so that's one of the. things we want to watch out so anytime we start these medicines, we have to be really careful Okay, we have to be careful to watch weight gain. So I always encourage the dash diet dietary approaches to stop hypertension that's trying to get 150 minutes of aerobic activity is about 3030 minutes five times a week walking you don't have to."
12799.0,Patient,"Take the bus, so I do walk a lot okay."
191.0,Provider,"Now, with most of these medicines, you have to watch for move okay. Any of these medicines, when you start dealing with any of the mental health medicines, you have to watch for you move Okay, you have to see doesn't make you feel worse okay. All right, so it doesn't seem like it makes you more angry, does he have any thoughts of harming yourself or anybody else. So that's why I want you to do the journal checking your mood. fatigue your motivation in any physical signs. upset stomach diarrhea Nadia Nadia is pretty common one notice doesn't make your your head feel funny any dizziness or lightheadedness okay. The way I usually do it is I start a medication off on the lowest dose Okay, and then I work. Work it up very slowly all right, and so I like to start and i'm gonna see what the actual lowest dose of this one is okay. yeah. yeah so yeah so you're definitely going to be blocking some of the serotonin uptake so to be in your body around a little bit more. Okay yeah. Okay. So i'm going back through here, make a certain i'm not missing anything. right here. yeah. So it's more of an ssri not so much Snr. Okay, so it's kind of similar to some of the Mano therapies, such as you peroxide teams for the walks of teens okay. And it's got some activities, a little bit. can help with the anxiety too. All right, Dan. But we'll definitely look at this. and watch for two Okay, so we have to be careful and you know what these types of medicines, you want to give it four to six weeks to see if it'll be effective. The earliest I usually have people notice that they started feel better is about. Two weeks. Okay. People notice they feel better."
12799.0,Patient,"You can't get them off of it automatically. Okay right yeah tape area remember all this it's been a long time since i've been on like I said, the last time I just didn't like what she was doing so I just threw them away and."
191.0,Provider,"we'll try, we have the genealogy now I found the genealogy to be very helpful but i've had people to not do as well. Even with the genealogy Okay, because we'll have to try to find what works. For you."
12799.0,Patient,"Right and the differences is this time i'm i'm really taking it seriously and and i'm also not doing drugs Those are two very huge differences. You know i'm really interested in getting my depression under control, I am just tired of struggling every day to just want to get everything done and. I just want to live, now that i'm clean and like this just get them my way and i'm tired. Definitely heard."
191.0,Provider,"yeah I definitely see where you're seeing with that review system, let me ask you this, any thoughts of plans a farmer yourself or anyone else."
12799.0,Patient,Not at all.
191.0,Provider,Seeing or hearing anything that's not there. No okay any chest pain shortness of breath.
12799.0,Patient,know.
191.0,Provider,Any stomach pain nausea vomiting diarrhea constipation.
12799.0,Patient,Know okay.
191.0,Provider,"I know that you do have some mild anxiety and some mild depression and you told me one of your main concerns as to fatigue, but you are sleeping well very well, it sounds like."
12799.0,Patient,"yeah I sleep I sleep too much and most part, I do pretty good like I said I I do struggle with some nightmares and some using dreams, but that's not in every night occurrence it's okay yeah."
191.0,Provider,"All right, okay so with any of these medicines anytime you take them even even and i've been using the genealogy I think now, I think I started using the Gian at genealogy like 2016 Okay, but. I always share with a patient. mm hmm that we still want to proceed with caution okay."
12799.0,Patient,"yeah yeah. Absolutely I just like having it because it just is that way we don't we don't even need to play around with. what's on the bad for me I just don't even want to play with that I just That way we can just skip that, all together, as far as i'm concerned and. I really appreciated having that so."
191.0,Provider,"And what i'm gonna do i'm gonna start you off on the lowest doses 10 milligrams Okay, I like to start off low. Because if you start off law as a negative side effect is best to note and on a lower dose okay. And is one tablet by mouth daily. Okay, and we'll see how you do we'll keep doing that and I usually like to have you on that low bills for at least a week or to make certain you're tolerating it well okay. So i'll send in a month supply okay 10 milligrams once a day I want you to start to journaling continue with your thyroid medicine. The truth is, you get net thyroid taken care of is going to be one of the huge things to help you feel better too. Because i've had people with thyroid wasn't working well, they were all on all kind of medicines and it didn't seem like it was effective. So you've you've got your priority, so in a good place you're dealing with your addiction. you're addressing the thyroid you're dealing with your you get your therapy and now we're and medicine, so you really put those parties good so i'm hoping that we'll have a better outcome so keep me posted on how you do with this okay."
12799.0,Patient,"I will, I will absolutely. So let's see I can give me my pharmacy I don't know if you guys already have it yeah safeway wrecker."
191.0,Provider,"Yes, so we have."
12799.0,Patient,yeah that's my pharmacy so wow 10 milligrams that's what is the what is the more common dose of that medicine.
191.0,Provider,"i'll be honest with you i've had people on Walesa, Dom but I don't remember the most common one i'll tell you why it's a newer medications at no medication, a lot of my patients need prior authorizations to get it. So the way it works many times you start with the medicines that are more common that you believe is best for your patient that you know will be covered. Like i've had some people on some really good newer medications. But by the time sometimes you have to do the prior authorization I don't know if they're going to cover for this medicine."
12799.0,Patient,"Okay right what why, let me ask you why. Okay, what about wellbutrin whoa What about that don't you like."
191.0,Provider,"I like wellbutrin okay. I like it, and for my patients often don't gain as much they say they they lose weight with it, it helps them smoking cessation i've had. Agents energy is better."
12799.0,Patient,yeah so I was just wondering if that does it help with depression i'm just wondering it.
191.0,Provider,Very well. yeah.
12799.0,Patient,"You know if that would be a good one and i'm pretty i'm almost positive insurance would cover that so I just don't know I mean i'm asking you, if. That would be. Something that we could try instead or. or well think."
191.0,Provider,"i've sent in the Dom. So that one and i'll tell you why the reason we lean more towards the latter down is because of the prior negative interaction with the world future now we don't know if that was because of drugs or not, but it also sounds like with the other medications drugs may have been an influence. yeah we don't know if the thyroid was an influence okay. But what we can do if there's any problems with the Walesa don't. You and I i'll be happy to meet with you and we'll look at our next we can target the next one will be true because we've got our genealogy list so will target the ones on that list. That should be a green light okay. Okay yeah for me okay. Do your journals see how how it, how do you really feel and. we're not expecting you to do a one at on the best okay. Do you find that once your do you when you get up in the morning, do you have a little bit more. i've kind of."
12799.0,Patient,"Nice reading my way yeah that's. What I remember about the wellbutrin and I just remember you know just feeling. You know I just don't I just don't remember enough about it, to know if I gave it enough time or if I you know I just I know that I was using. And so, and I just. The only reason I asked me because I guess that's a common one, and i've heard a lot about it and i've heard a lot of people talk about the success of it and so. i'm just wondering if that would be successful for me to um."
191.0,Provider,And we can.
12799.0,Patient,make it look into that.
191.0,Provider,"Okay okay. yeah. Just so you know there's been a lot of people that have had success on Zola i've had is all our families if it's alexa families. i've had people do the genealogy the medication work that shouldn't have worked on a genealogy but, for the most part, I found the genealogy to be very helpful so. The good thing is the Plaza don't and the wellbutrin or both, and your green light I call that you agree. Right area."
12799.0,Patient,Right like I.
191.0,Provider,like that.
12799.0,Patient,Okay yeah I mean I trust you so. yeah we'll give this a go and hopefully my Internet. What happens if my insurance won't cover.
191.0,Provider,"It if your insurance does not cover it what they will say is, we recommend this this that net so will be will probably be one on that they will. recommend. we'll go back we'll choose the one that we that they believe is more similar. And we can look at the wellbutrin we can look at the other ones that's onto your green light, and that will be covered so we got to look at two things what's under your green light and what's going to be covered by your insurance. Okay, we can have another meeting of the minds okay."
12799.0,Patient,"Okay, so so then right now just deal with my pharmacy."
