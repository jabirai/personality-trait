10419.0,Patient,Here I am.
408.0,Provider,Hello.
10419.0,Patient,hey how was your vacation.
408.0,Provider,"I lovely. or anyway. And I I think I mentioned, also in group last week that i'm going to not be. Providing at group, this week, providing therapy, because I have my annual physical, at the same time, but Mr will be back for this week's group in case you have any medication issues, but I think all you medications are currently being provided by your local. doctor right. And pharmacist good good So do I need to keep going to group by I really enjoy group when it was smaller but now that it's so large right. Well, not only that. I think you really completed your treatment plan so i'm if you did need to continue treatment with brighter health, you would be required to go to group, as I understand it, that's I believe is their protocol is. An individual, although the I think the frequency of required groups can be very can be flat in a flexed but. um you've made progress, to the point where I was really planning to engage in what's called our termination session at our next individual appointment because you have met all your treatment goals. Okay yay."
10419.0,Patient,"hey yeah and i'm continuing to learn and take action i'm reading another book well i'm audio listening to another book by Caroline leaf about cleaning up your messy mind. And neuro plasticity you know and how to retrain yourself. Yes, i'm not very far along but it's a lot of what you've talked about you know about the tools about like. You know, take a deep breath figure out what's going on, you know do an assessment from a different point of view and usually I do, that I don't know it just was. I think that this whole incident, I mean like i'm i'm usually pretty together, but I think this whole incident The root cause is. As partially ADHD but, but because I I take on too much back i've been having lots of dreams about that you know they needed help somebody to make sandwiches and I look out and it's this huge cafeteria and i'm the only one, making sandwiches. Although you know but i'm the one that took on too much physically mentally emotionally time wise, I mean part of it and i'm physically, you know, with all the things going on i've got behind and overwhelmed. And it just you know that I guess that's the change disorder part, but if I can learn how to not do that, not making sandwiches for everybody, or pay for everybody, or you know i've been working on the relationship with my daughter, and my son's actually doing better i'm. Through this, so I think it's been good that i've had counseling because I was able to share with him and now he's in counseling but he's in counseling you know the top that. cognitive cognitive behavioral. um he doesn't he's not doing any kind of medication. But i'm doing medication, but I felt like I needed that tool, you know and but I don't think I need it forever like i'm not even sure I need adderall forever."
408.0,Provider,"Well, the adderall the treatment of your ADHD and then I mean really the treatment for ADHD is medication. The treatment of the adder of the ADHD will allow you not to have to go into hyper focus in order to get things done, which then is to the detriment of your own. Self care and health and other relationships, you know that. need your attention because that was the only or not, the owner, but the main compensatory strategy, you had to handle your ADHD as well as self isolation and reducing stimuli. Right until your ADHD was treated. Now there's treated you'll find that less and less you'll need to use the hyper focusing, and therefore the bad side effects of that compensatory strategy will decrease."
10419.0,Patient,"yeah I I don't think hyper focus is working, yet so. That was the hardest part to get out of this hole is that I do rely on this hyper focus and control my environment and list, and all that. But whatever happened during this trauma the surgery the medication I don't have the ability, at this moment. To turn it on which probably maybe you."
408.0,Provider,"need it. Yes, you don't need it, you don't need to do it and that's a good thing in in the sense that it was detrimental to your health because I have to solely when you have to rely on that. So much that's what's associated and you can't really focus your attention in general that's what leads to things like not. Not eating like going to the bathroom becoming hyper focused on things that are low priority that then interfere with your sleep and your rest and create accidents and things like that."
10419.0,Patient,"yeah it's a vicious cycle, and I can see how it led to an accident, because. I know. yep if if I could have you know, I was, I was handling more than I could and plus I was losing my eyesight so I just hired somebody to do more, I site for me, did I miss us."
408.0,Provider,I don't see there you go.
10419.0,Patient,"And i'm. headed ignored the asset like I ignored going eating or going to the bathroom I just hired an outside person to help me with the asset stuff. But that's why i'm so far behind on taxes, but then other health things can, and you know I just it's a spiral down when I am not healthy because when i'm healthy i'm like you know awesome so."
408.0,Provider,"I think that all your own stuff but, if your ADHD isn't treated Elizabeth your the price you pay is way too hard."
10419.0,Patient,"yeah um I am working on treatment now i'm not sure you know. First of all, ADHD or has a hard time like when you say how are you doing like cuz, we have to check in and do all of that, and I know you know this about me like you know, I have to I pay attention because my ankle hurts, because then I can't take my attention off of my."
408.0,Provider,Exactly because that's a high veil and stimulus that really grabs your attention.
10419.0,Patient,Right so um I don't really pay attention as much until it's I have a once.
408.0,Provider,"Well, your brain. Your brain cannot filter that's that's what ADHD is that plus the impulse impulsivity and hyperactivity that's the that is the nature of ADHD."
10419.0,Patient,"And no i'm not are on medication. Exactly because. I, this is my theory from being inside ADHD is that the ones that are hyper. We are doing everything we can to. Focus, I mean like like i'm i'm making my adrenal glands compensate for."
408.0,Provider,awake less right.
10419.0,Patient,"um and the other thing is to I don't think we're not medicated asleep different to. yeah like. Because i'm so used to be in like you know tight and rigid and anxious, because that helps me stay awake. Right i'm. Good at night when you're sleeping they're still part of something going on, you don't sleep as well, which makes you less away the next day and you're. Right, you know and it's so true i've had muscle testing and I, you know, have a nutritionist and all the time they're saying you know you've blown out your adrenal glands you know, and all of us have. Our adrenal glands, but when I am meditated I don't have to use my adrenal glands. Exactly and. i'm alert, but I still feel like me. But it's really hard to get the medication, I am."
408.0,Provider,"And i'm sorry about that that is a. A fault of our health care system, but you stick with it because compared to the alternative that's a minor problem."
10419.0,Patient,"Now, how do I know when i'm at the right because this 20 milligrams doesn't last."
408.0,Provider,"You have to work with your prescriber you have to work with the prescriber and self monitor and there are model ADHD monitoring checklist. That you can get online that will help you to self monitor and you as your as you reach the appropriate dosing level, you will basically what you're doing is is monitoring that your ADHD symptoms are in fact decreasing. The quality, while you have the medication treatment. It is not a cure, but if those symptoms will decrease when you're at your appropriate dose, particularly at the halfway point of the dosing cycle. So. Some high. level is four hours, that means you'd be at your peak. At mid cycle your peak reduction or treatment of ADHD at mid point which would be the to our point."
10419.0,Patient,To our allies.
408.0,Provider,If you're on a four hour i'm giving an example. So dosing cycle is how long the stimulant medication is formatted to last. Once you're at the appropriate dose.
10419.0,Patient,And then the other thing is is. Because the health care system is that it what it is it's not a long enough dose.
408.0,Provider,"Well, there are longer acting forms of the medication, that you can explore with your prescriber."
10419.0,Patient,yeah I think I will because she. was my trial.
408.0,Provider,yeah do a trial.
10419.0,Patient,A faster release for the afternoon.
408.0,Provider,And that's another alternative.
10419.0,Patient,You can also have a small many reasons why you can't go get at what you need for advice creation.
408.0,Provider,But just so you know the appropriate of science about it that they are also people who are hyperactive during sleep that benefit from a low dose of short acting stimulant medication right before bedtime.
10419.0,Patient,yeah I am I feel like for some reason that medication during the day helps me sleep better at night.
408.0,Provider,"Well, as. Well, yes. When you when you're no longer relying on being totally stressed out in order to treat radiates better."
10419.0,Patient,"And I wonder. You know, because even during the ankle break even though I was in terrible pain. My body was in terrible pain and I thought I was okay and but you know, I guess, I was using all kinds of those same chemicals during. girona tragedy or accident that I used daily and I never even realized it, I never realized that drive like. You know, like if it was starting to rain really bad they are in Texas and you're on the road, and maybe you're listening to a podcast or something you know here is ready to go. You would turn off the radio and make sure you're tending to and you would get that posture like you know but that's how it is all the time here."
408.0,Provider,You know you're you're always. gripping that wheel for. US do i've seen on the radio on and i'm.
10419.0,Patient,"I have like i'm always tended to and I always you know i'm doing like very um. it's funny because you just don't notice when you're doing stuff that is what you're doing like even my trampoline I was oxygenated I had no idea, you know. So anyway i'm trying to form good stuff so i'll look up the ADHD monitoring checklist and then i'll work with my provider, because the reason that it doesn't last very long is detrimental is because very dependent on schedule. And then taking the medicine at different times a day it's. It just doesn't."
408.0,Provider,difficult to manage.
10419.0,Patient,"What messes up a schedule and I almost feel like the schedule is just as important as the medication. Okay, this when I take it at different times a day it's like I took it later this morning, so that I could actually speak to you, without. It I just can't get us casual going."
408.0,Provider,"Well, look at it, a different way, though Elizabeth is, you have now as an adult since you control your own schedule. That does give you more flexibility than a school child with ADHD would have in deciding with your prescriber the best timing. For your doses to make sure that the peak effect advocacy at that midpoint of the cycle, the dosing cycle is hitting you when you need it, the most for whatever task you're doing. Like driving."
10419.0,Patient,yeah it's very it's a feeling like i'm. A lack of schedule i've been doing that because I feel like the driving or riding a contract or listening or.
408.0,Provider,"You know it's not a lack of schedule is, but you just have some more flexibility to coordinate your schedule with your ADHD treatment, so that you'll be at peak performance."
10419.0,Patient,"I guess so um I think it's a little difficult because, as a real estate agent that just as all over the place."
408.0,Provider,"Because well so that. So the pace may need to be you may need to vary the pace, so that, in the interest of enhancing your performance."
10419.0,Patient,"Yes, I. yeah so I haven't i've been pretty good about I haven't been doing buyers and just doing the stains. there's the thing I do when i'm doing a little bit too much, and then I feel like I hit the wall and physically I hit the wall less Thursday. Because we had two major storms come through I guess the West, of whatever hurricane was coming through and the pain got so bad, and I just had to lay around a few you know to catch up some."
408.0,Provider,"Right, but ultimately what you're what I hear you saying is because you're not relying on an adrenaline rush to treat your ADHD now that you're treated for it by prescription, you can gradually experience less wear and tear on yourself. yeah and get better and better. at coordinating your your performance schedules and your options for medication."
10419.0,Patient,"Yes, I think that will help maybe just a longer both."
408.0,Provider,"You know, like I said you there are such format, you need to explore that going forward with your prescriber. And you. knows, at some point, you might even be. In a different state that has a better of you know, health insurance system and our pharmacy system, and so on, oh."
10419.0,Patient,"yeah it is so great, because i'm i'm still on insurance because of the national pandemic, but my Admiral can cost me $2 or $350 a month."
408.0,Provider,Is that crazy it's crazy.
10419.0,Patient,"Oh yeah and it's something that I need, but you know what I have friends that are diabetic and that is. Oh heart."
408.0,Provider,"For insulin is crazy expensive. Under some insurance plans and that's just so wrong, I mean it's all wrong."
10419.0,Patient,"yeah everything's kind of messed up, and I think this whole experience has actually been good, you know i've learned a lot myself."
408.0,Provider,Oh yes.
10419.0,Patient,"And my physical limitations and my body actually just looking out for me, you know you think you're going to work on that and then get up and do that and that matt you're going to risk, you know. In a good experience, and I feel like i've learned so many tools from you and it's helped me with my daughter. And I called her out on something remember we're all he but."
408.0,Provider,"You also don't forget you recovered from your adjustment disorder. which you had experienced before when there is a highly stressful life change. yeah covered from that and that is recoverable, unlike the ADHD which is chronic. The adjustment disorder is time time frame short. I mean not short but you know what I mean it is time limited."
10419.0,Patient,"And you have to go back to that. And um you know, I think that ADHD or a lot have that. that's really good."
408.0,Provider,They are at higher risk that's right.
10419.0,Patient,"that's why we that's why you look at my he woke me up on linkedin you can cuz she's she's done everything. Because i've done a lot actually but till I don't care, you know so um yeah but it's helped me with my daughter and it's helped me with my son. is doing better I I do think he's taken responsibility and um which takes a while you know to say I can take responsibility and do the work, not just expecting the outside world to change her you know, so I think it's I think it's been a really good experience and i've learned a lot. I saw a place to go. Learning was, but you know today, while i'm doing some of my I moved everything to the other side because I didn't want to be distracted over here but. You can see so to my desk is."
408.0,Provider,"Paul nice nice orderly, though, look at those stats."
10419.0,Patient,"Look at those cucumber shot there that's. that's for my own garden. lovely yes, seven, eight now there's a garden. lovely yeah everything is organized and i'm i've got a list going, but when I. coming to this site fear this desk. Is you know, so I just have on this test what i'm working on. At a time, you know. It is easier when you can control your environment controlling your schedule."
408.0,Provider,"Well, I would suggest. A sense of Mr Cruz, you know is familiar with your pace, even though he's not currently prescribing any medication for you, I would suggest that you go ahead and attend a final group session this week. And after everybody else, all the other clients leave the session just say that you're going to remain because you need to touch base with him and just tell him. What we've been talking about and that you and you and I have agreed, and you feel comfortable that you have completed your treatment plan and that you have confidence that your local prescriber can handle your medications and so you would like to terminate with bright heart health. And then he can. Then he proceeds with the discharge process which takes about 30 days and you receive a discharge letter notifying you of that."
10419.0,Patient,Why do I need a discharge plan.
408.0,Provider,I mean I just it's just a it's just etiquette you know to be polite to let you know.
10419.0,Patient,Okay.
408.0,Provider,tied in about tied in a bossa there no loosens hanging around.
10419.0,Patient,Okay.
408.0,Provider,it's not negative.
10419.0,Patient,"Yes, how these terms seem some negative, you know I studied some neuro linguistic programming and marketing. And so, when I see you know I automatically see the negative and stuff you know, like."
408.0,Provider,"One day, know, for example, that you don't have any outstanding. bills you don't have any outstanding obligations with this health care provider, you know. So, again to tie up the loose ends."
10419.0,Patient,"All right, and then. just keep doing like research and reading and learning."
408.0,Provider,"Well, I mean just keep doing. The. The medication treatment for ADHD and as its benefits you the mood medication, as it benefits you and, as you said, at some point, you may decide that you no longer. are benefiting from it and can discontinue that but ADHD is a lifelong condition and then you would also continue the compensatory strategies that you've developed over a lifetime, that are not unhealthy the ones that still allow you to take care of yourself right like oxygenation. And also continue to work with your local health care provider your primary care physician to look over your total health right and continue to keep abreast of your good health habits and I would say you have a lot of good notes to yourself about self talk right healthy self talk."
10419.0,Patient,"yeah no I don't really have this much stuff talk as you think I, I think."
408.0,Provider,As you chose me before you haven't really needed much because you liked yourself.
10419.0,Patient,"yeah like myself, but it took years I did, like the whole new earth effort totally and practicing the power of now, which the power of now it's not so bad for ADHD years we're we're now."
408.0,Provider,You know you're always in the moment well yeah.
10419.0,Patient,"But um, but I have learned through mindfulness practice to not have chatter that's the whole Pratt."
408.0,Provider,Exactly that's a very.
10419.0,Patient,"that's that mindfulness of make my bed without any other interfering thoughts is like a meditation and then, when I do my dishes i'm really just doing dishes."
408.0,Provider,Excellent much my whole.
10419.0,Patient,thing so.
408.0,Provider,I think the minds of my paint the body scan is another mindfulness technique that will always be helpful and useful.
10419.0,Patient,"To get that into habit, because I forget to do it because. I mean for a lot of years and ADHD or we're not that in touch with our bodies to you know it's so funny because I did acupuncture and i'm different you know I have different energy healing stuff and and this one lady was trying to teach me taxi or something. Years ago, and I started laughing and she goes what I said it's just so cute that you think you have hands, you know I mean like like I just see the world so differently, that you know when I close my eyes, I don't have a body so it's a you know."
408.0,Provider,That show body awareness increase that body awareness.
10419.0,Patient,"That body scan needs to be habit, because I do have a body and I need to you know my boyfriend's would always say well you're just not very grounded, but what they mean is you're not in your body, you know what I mean because it's."
408.0,Provider,"So hobbies and or you might think of it as physical activities like like TAI Chi like yoga maybe something at some point, your life, you will actually. decide to do even though your ADHD brain will tell you that it's stupid and silly."
10419.0,Patient,yeah its origin is.
408.0,Provider,aurora aurora yes right.
10419.0,Patient,With ADHD but maybe a treated ADHD year. Right my old hobbies before the broken ankle work camping hiking and kayaking so.
408.0,Provider,All good things all good things right.
10419.0,Patient,"yeah cuz you're out in nature, somehow, then you know and walk a walk or a hike in the woods, but you know i'm locked like 3000 steps in my apartment this morning but it's not the same as going out outside."
408.0,Provider,yeah be able to do those things you'll be able to do those things yeah.
10419.0,Patient,"yeah mine was getting a little bit better. my daughter kept saying you know you know cuz she's not very good hell she says, I use a CBD lotion or cream on my joints because she's an artist and she gets the. carpal tunnel, maybe um but she says like when you got this lotion I think it'll really help you it really helps me, you know and that's down in the joint. And she goes i'm kind of talking to you i'm calling my brother and so he went to the CBD store, which is walking distance, for me, and I have a cream now. And it does help and it even helps with the inflammation and the pain like holy crap I should have been doing this, I should have listened to her sooner because. I thought it was a bunch of you know, like these kids these days, think that you know painted going because you rub a lotion on it, but it did so. that's that's helped after the rain this week that really help calm down. My ankle my ankle doesn't like the rain or."
408.0,Provider,lowboy glad you're feeling better.
10419.0,Patient,yeah so all right well i'll keep working hard and I need to incorporate a habit of body scanning you know through.
408.0,Provider,"Life and maybe that will you know, maybe you'll also in the future. decide to take part in some kind of adaptive yoga or TAI Chi just as a personal you know health habit personal growth or positive you know, a way to be in your body to increase your body awareness, just as a hobby."
10419.0,Patient,yeah cuz I really need that. I really need that I think it helps and I think you know with ADHD the exercise really helps so.
408.0,Provider,Right and the mindfulness also like you're saying the mindfulness is linked to some of those same methods as yoga and TAI Chi when you do it with your daily activities like dishwashing bed making that's excellent.
10419.0,Patient,"yeah it helps with our feel a little bit. hey i'm not getting as overwhelmed I started to get overwhelmed and anxious today, but now that I hear your voice in my head, I hear voices Doc. that's a. Okay, take a deep breath what's going on, you feel overwhelmed because you have a lot to do let's get a list going let's break it down into small steps, and then that's reorder it. And you know even met. I started to do."
408.0,Provider,"And you know, in terms of your business as a self employed person once you can afford it, you always have the option of hiring an admin right or personal assistant to do some of the paperwork busy work for you."
10419.0,Patient,"to know what happens is is that I hire somebody and then I take on paying them, you know over $2,000 a month to you know. i'm saying once a fortnight at once."
408.0,Provider,"Well, once it becomes more affordable, but now that you now that you're at your point where you are having completed your treatment, this is just an option for you to consider and you probably won't need them as much as you used to."
10419.0,Patient,"Now I really need a bookkeeper. I had a bookkeeper help set up for the i'm still behind on taxes and. i'm i'm getting better, though I think i'll be able to get to that and I haven't taken on too much which."
408.0,Provider,"right but that's what i'm saying is is entertain the possibility at least that you won't need someone at that level of $2,000 a month employee, now that you're right now that your ADHD is treated, because you can do a lot more without the cost of the wear and tear on yourself."
10419.0,Patient,"Because I really. really have to make a bunch of money, I mean i'm debt free, besides the back taxes. I own a car, I live small. mean but I make a lot of money, my most of it goes to Texas, as you know, but um I don't think I should push myself too I think my priorities were wrong and that mainly I need to make sure my health comes first. yep and work come second. Good so um you know if I don't have money for my daughter, and my son well if if I push myself too far, then I break and spiral adjustment disorder because of bad health. Right in your sleep bad hill or some big."
408.0,Provider,Like lose the job during in the rear.
10419.0,Patient,"or right yes exactly that's just part of it, because of. You know I hadn't I had employees, I had someone that helped staging I had a full time assistant, I have full time made, even though I live in a little bitty apartment above a store and a 260 year old town, I had all this help, well then Kofi it came. like this is enough to support all these people, but all these people were going on and I had to do it alone because i've built up that. business to support everybody. I didn't want that business for me to do it and i'm, so I think that trying to handle everything by myself. Because of coven because then I did take on too much, and I take on too much anyway, but then i'm doing their jobs and i'm pretty good at my job, but their jobs, not as much, but my main has come back. gay or."
408.0,Provider,gay or yes yeah.
10419.0,Patient,And he so CD to so most people think my house is spotless and that's part of my mental illness but.
408.0,Provider,"Well, you like to have your House orderly, you need to have it orderly."
10419.0,Patient,"I just have to it's just it's really difficult when things get behind. You know and i'm still behind, but I feel like my health is catching up and now i'm starting to catch up. If I can just get this medicine to last a little bit longer I think I think that would be a big help. yeah and then and then also I think it's really important that I work on. Making this body scan part of you know all day. Because I did do that today I was feeling very, very anxious and I did the deep breaths and the body scan and wrote to myself, you know what are you feeling feeling anxious my are you feeling overwhelmed no. Yes. so excited so I wrote it down and talk to myself and solved it myself, but it did start with breathing and a body scan. And i'm medicated but. Right medicated you still need to do these things."
408.0,Provider,yeah well they're always they're good that kind of thing is good. For people without ADHD so think of it that way.
10419.0,Patient,"Right So yes. So it really helped. I mean absolutely. I almost think that still, even though it has caused the hyper focus and the burnout and other problems, I still think ADHD is a gift because I mean when I mean normal people they think I have it together and that my life is easy. Right, because my house is clean my laundry done there's a list of things to do my stuff is together they just don't know how much work it is to. get it all."
408.0,Provider,"up and you're self employed, I mean most people don't choose to be self employed because it takes too much i'm constantly thinking about work right most people want to be able to do a nine to five job and leave work and have a life."
10419.0,Patient,"I tried that too, but then you can't control your environment as well, I may not have been more successful and I make more money being self employed, because I can control things mean, I can say yes or no, or."
408.0,Provider,"Yes, which is helpful for someone with ADHD that's what I was saying earlier it's you have options, also for how you use your medication right because you can control that now as an adult."
10419.0,Patient,"Right and um that has helped I mean, I think the main thing you know is driving first because I get very. paying attention dropping you know."
408.0,Provider,"Like well and that's very, very much a high risk activity so."
10419.0,Patient,yeah and then the second thing just talking to people or working on paperwork I do it faster with less.
408.0,Provider,oxygen absolutely absolutely.
10419.0,Patient,"Yes, he i'll make cucumber from my farm."
408.0,Provider,Nice.
10419.0,Patient,"I bet my cortisol levels are less to because it does really I feel. I feel less hyper or less I feel awake but but i'm not having to be tense or hyper. Good so that helps. All right, and what do you think is the most thing what's the biggest thing that I need to work on going for. Like if you you've known a pretty good time, you know I."
408.0,Provider,"Still, I think you're still in process regulating finding the best regulation of your ADHD treatment, so I think moving forward to work with your prescriber on that."
10419.0,Patient,"yeah actually we've been I see her again on the 11th she's seeing me once a month until we get it right.
