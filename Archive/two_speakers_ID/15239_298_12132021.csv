15239.0,Patient,yeah it's 30 milligrams.
298.0,Provider,"Okay, and who's been prescribing that."
15239.0,Patient,"As my main well she's not a doctor she's a nurse practitioner. and I took a. No she's not a doctor so she didn't have the resources to really you know. Make the call you know if I really have ADHD so I took this really weird kind of high school tests, you know it was like a computer test and I didn't really qualify So this was the best I could get and it's just really intense."
298.0,Provider,What do you mean by intense.
15239.0,Patient,"It just has a lot of side effects i've just like easy affected by meds and it just really I can't sleep very well on it and I get like maybe six hours of sleep, sometimes for. And as far as like it it treats. Binge eating disorder and it's like I barely eat on it and. And it does cause, like other side effects and it, I think it does cause anxiety which I already have, I think it makes that worse, and you know it's just."
298.0,Provider,Before you went on by Vance did you do anything else.
15239.0,Patient,"No that's why I just I was like tired of suffering from. Both of those things, so I just I really needed something."
298.0,Provider,and Have you tried the instant release of adderall.
15239.0,Patient,"No, I heard that was pretty intense too."
298.0,Provider,It seems odd to me that you would go straight for vibe dance. Because guys yeah. So it's very long acting.
15239.0,Patient,"yeah it is I kind of find that out the hard way when I slept in and it takes a couple hours to take effect, and I would be awake until like midnight or two in the morning."
298.0,Provider,"Right right. and See. I wonder if you would do well on a small dosage once a day of a medication called adderall. And you know do like 10 milligrams once a day the top doses like 40 milligrams a day, so you could even take that 10 milligram and cut it in half and do five it burns out of your system and five to six hours. Which is nice. it's yeah you're not doing that. yeah what I like for binge eating is just good old fashioned well be a trend, and I am also going to send over and do some more screening on you, for ADHD. Okay, do you need any of your other meds refilled."
15239.0,Patient,No.
298.0,Provider,and Do you feel like you're hyperactive or an attentive.
15239.0,Patient,it's definitely an attentive.
298.0,Provider,And do you struggle with organization.
15239.0,Patient,"it's no I mean once I get the motivation to do it, I do fine."
298.0,Provider,So it's motivation you struggle with like dope I mean.
15239.0,Patient,yeah.
298.0,Provider,"Okay, can I, like the braver man assessment to kind of teach on neuro chemicals, and can you look it up online and just kind of see how dope amine works on the brain."
15239.0,Patient,and
298.0,Provider,"Stephen Stevens JESSICA Stevens need, as far as. Do you struggle with getting tasks completed."
15239.0,Patient,Oh yeah definitely.
298.0,Provider,Do you struggle with listening to people talk or does your mind starts to wander.
15239.0,Patient,And I guess it depends what they're talking about and if i'm interested in the topic.
298.0,Provider,Okay.
15239.0,Patient,Like for school definitely.
298.0,Provider,"I you. Okay, you cannot take my vans and adderall at the same time okay."
15239.0,Patient,Oh yeah I definitely want to start taking it.
298.0,Provider,"yeah oh good good, and you can cut the tablet and the half it can take away your appetite which you know so cutting it in half. If you don't want to take it let's say on one day, then just don't take it like and, if you want to take it only once that day, then only take it once. I let you kind of figure that out what works best for you."
15239.0,Patient,Can you repeat the name of that test for the dope amine.
298.0,Provider,that's okay braver man.
15239.0,Patient,that's the name is a test.
298.0,Provider,yeah it's an you'll put braver man assessment and put a Google will come up with like probably two different tests. And it teaches you a little bit about your. Brain chemistry. All right. If you have a problem with your prescription getting it paid for by your insurance go to the virtual clinic and ask them for a prior authorization okay.
15239.0,Patient,Is it expensive.
298.0,Provider,"So they probably but not like. Not like my Vance, though. Okay, my Vance is much more expensive. And so there'll be more inclined to pay this but I don't put people on by Vance until they have succeeded on adderall they can't go to buy dance I just can't deal I can't do the yeah anyway. So if you have side effects to this medication, let me know I want to know what they are, we it may not be the right medicine for you, but we'll figure this out. Okay, all right Okay, do you have any other questions for me."
15239.0,Patient,That was my main one if there would be side effects.
298.0,Provider,"weight loss insomnia. mood. When you come off of these type of medications if you get more irritable that's why we have to get the lowest dose possible to get the effect that we want, so we don't have the side effects. yeah. Is that there are good things that come out of it too. yeah yeah."
15239.0,Patient,Is it one of those things that once you start taking it you get used to it.
298.0,Provider,don't really. i'm a little bit just a little bit. But not too bad.
