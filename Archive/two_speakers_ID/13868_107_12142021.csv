ID,Role,Message
107.0,Provider,alright. So how is it going so you arrived there safely. Fantastic step one.
13868.0,Patient,"Yes, I are not a good flyer anymore I don't know what happened, but I just did not a fan."
107.0,Provider,"Well, I haven't flown since all the regulations have kind of become much more stringent, so I would imagine that it's the dynamic itself is more intense."
13868.0,Patient,"yeah and everybody's cranky about it, I."
107.0,Provider,Think that's really.
13868.0,Patient,"My issue was is. Like we all, we all hate this word like shut up."
107.0,Provider,"Right like this is not nobody here is like hey, this is a lot of fun to where. You know, a hazmat suit when I travel yay."
13868.0,Patient,let's do it some more.
107.0,Provider,let's yeah sign me up I need to do this every day yeah I know.
13868.0,Patient,"yeah there was some funny moments, there were some people behind us that. I don't even remember oh. Before the plane like even taxi or anything we're all sitting there waiting on everybody gets eaten and it's hotter than crap in there obviously we're in Houston That was our layover. And so the lady is griping she's hot. But she reaches up and like spins a little air vent so it's venti she's like well it feels cool and then they start arguing about. it's available and the motors get running into cool off and just their accents and you could tell they were older ehlers hilarious and that was a good thing about having a mask because we're sitting there dying laughing and you couldn't tell who it was. We found joy."
107.0,Provider,There you go that's the big things in the small thing.
13868.0,Patient,"yeah. So, so far, so good there's only been a couple of um. let's i'll start with my high points."
107.0,Provider,"All right, okay."
13868.0,Patient,"So, but then i'm fully laughs it was kind of a hectic. You know, will need a vacation from the vacation. We went to las cruces, which is where my husband's parents leave live dropped her dog off and then which albuquerque the next day and. That night when we got there we were sitting down kind of getting a game plan together. This is what we're doing and what we want to do as far as. Reservations for food go and stuff like that. hi. My husband came in the room i'm still here. love you bye. He had to get candy let's be real income is a high. Any housework just sitting there and I told him. So here's what I need from you guys I need for us to try to avoid comments about you know good food versus bad attitude, or having to walk X amount of space to earn the food. I love when I went to treatment, one of my goals was. That, I want to have dessert and not have guilt about it and i'd still like to do that because i'm already tired mentally like. Fighting that urge to just fall into old habits or whatever and it's helpful if everybody just doesn't talk about it just leave it out helpful for all of us, and my dad. he's like well i'll try, he said i've been talking crap about cinnamon and sugar combo for a long time. Excuse me, and I was like I get that I said it's fine if you keep it to yourself, for you and mom talk about it but. If you can keep me in the kids and Sean out of the range of it because i'm not asking you to change your whole life to make my life easier, but if you know catch yourself thinking about it. Keep it to your."
107.0,Provider,Mindful yeah.
13868.0,Patient,"yeah, and so they were very receptive. And my dad I didn't know this until we got up there, but he has plantar fasciitis and his."
107.0,Provider,folks oh.
13868.0,Patient,"Really really badly. yeah he does now, but he he had been kind of struggling with it and 2020 like it started and he's a runner. And like he was taking some time off obviously coven kind of benched everybody, but for him, he was teaching and it shut down the school, he was teaching out and they never opened back up. So it just kind of snowballed for him, so he ended up getting worse because he I get the impression he's not really resting like K should be. Maybe it's runs in our blood. But anyhow so as it stands right now he's got like a half inch of that plan is fasciitis along the bottom of his foot. And so, this has provider told him you're probably going to need surgery man like you need to chill out, and so they gave him a boot and he gave him the little nice scooter. And he told him because it only hurts him when he standing what is walking it's Okay, what are you running it's Okay, who. stops and his idol. Is when it like catches up to him I got a cortisone shot and I didn't know any of that stuff I didn't know that he would have a booth or any of that kind of stuff so I was like Oh, and of course he's trying to downplay because it doesn't want to put any of us out for it. So you just kind of see it. happening within him that he's really fighting the urge to be salty about it about it to himself like and I did tell him when he was telling us about he said just don't get old guys don't do it. It sounds like that made me think about it like this, I said mom when she had all her knees replaced and everything she was only 41 and that's not old enough fight anybody who says it is. So, but you're in your mid 60s you've gotten a lot of mileage out of your body before it decided that it's going to have an issue that's fixable. And he was like oh I didn't think about that, thank you for that. Fixed your face I was like what and so anyways he's trying to give him all the all of the credit and all of the kudos for trying. So I was able to like voice what I needed to everybody and i've been when that actually lead to a bigger conversation of. Just kind of. diet culture in general and how it affects us all, and how he has my dad specifically has been infected and. You know anywhere two or more gathered dietary diet talk starts right, so he was talking about firefighters and stuff so he was kind of. You can tell the things that i've passed along he's mold over at least so that's good so far there's been no comments on body size of about themselves or otherwise it's been very good, I hope that continues. um. Then, here comes a wonky part, maybe it's wonky I don't know it's day one, so it's bound to be wonky but. we're This is our family boom we planned this and."
107.0,Provider,"Then, my parents my moon is so interesting instead of honeymoon family members. yeah that's fantastic okay sorry."
13868.0,Patient,"So we've put a lot, I mean it's three and a half years in the making, we. Just. Building up the excitement and things like. And my dad has said several times, this is all his vacation when we talked a little bit about this now this other person's coming in."
107.0,Provider,Right right.
13868.0,Patient,"Ultimately, what came of that since last We talked is so my dad is going to run what's called the Dolby challenge so he'll run X amount of miles here in Disney world. In the beginning of January and then. Maybe march they run in Disneyland in California X amount of miles, and then they get medals. or something that's like completed this challenge that they're he and my mom doing my mom doesn't run as refers to aforementioned titanium knees, she speed walks in either way she is about so i'm about it, for her."
107.0,Provider,But yeah yeah.
13868.0,Patient,"So the first leg of that is. Two weeks after we get back from this trip. Okay, so they are balls to the wall people I see where I get it um but what my dad is doing is setting up a chocolate and wine tasting for my mom. As a romantic gesture. Which is."
107.0,Provider,Yet another. Face moment I mean.
13868.0,Patient,"yeah yeah my help. She was like Can you help me figure this out because I don't know and also because my mom's a charity can't hardly surprise her because she's on it she's very. In your face a little bit like, why are you being sketchy. anyways we shot and I went picked up groceries for the resort yesterday when we landed and then we also picked up some wine and so now it's up to my dad to get that wine covertly stashed with. This new person that's coming. Without her opening it and raising like anyways did my dad stands now, I did my part I bought right, it was. Like. I facilitated a potentially good time I hope so, God bless you go with God."
107.0,Provider,Right anyways.
13868.0,Patient,"Today we get up and we're all jazzed and me and the girls are really like psyching Liam up and it's gonna be so much fun, then we get over there and it's like my parents become. I don't know like keystone COPs almost like they're almost bumping into each other, they can't figure out which way to go, they really haven't done any like we don't need to plan this to the minute, but we have to have some idea of. Right."
107.0,Provider,I need a little baby structure and what we're doing here people.
13868.0,Patient,"yeah so that i'm getting frustrated because i'm like I don't want to be the planner i'm trying not to be a perfectionist. Right y'all didn't do anything so my innate like i'm mama bear and then I started, you know getting in my own head about an overthinking it I, and I realized without being hyper sensitive to the fact that I am the liaison between. My husband and stuff son and my mom and dad because this is our first big family vacation all together so that's just just the way that it is i'm the i'm the."
107.0,Provider,you're the go between.
13868.0,Patient,"yeah, but I have to decide how much of that i'm going. To. Take on right leg. And so the first part of the morning was just really. kind of fresh it was frustrating not kind of it was frustrating, and then the ride, we got on we got right to the front of it and it shut down. What so then we kind of sat there like literally sat on the ground and. I can feel Liam getting annoyed because he's 12 and he wants to ride rides. And he's not understanding that a lot of the time in the effort and the thought processes that did go into this, where the experience of it like Star Wars land, for example. Like i'm all."
107.0,Provider,dressed the part home so today is Star Wars day yeah.
13868.0,Patient,"I hate Star Wars, but here we are."
107.0,Provider,it's no artist very cool.
13868.0,Patient,"He is he's very cute I like him. yeah i've gotten lots of compliments on my attire today so. Good I love it anyways um so then with those kind of numbers have ended up wasting like almost three hours of. Just that frustration and for liam's like and want to revise your. Right anyways there's just it was frustrating, and so, finally, I was like okay let's find a ride. right that we can get on and like get all of our motivation back on course. Right and that time or by then it wasn't I had talked all of my snacks right, so I never caught with my pants down, as it were, but by the time we got off to the ride that everybody had eaten my snacks. because everybody was cranky sounds like. don't yell at me look. Right take it on so anyways so I was like okay well let's order food and then, when we're off this ride, then we can go pick up food and then Sean and I will head back to the hotel. And so, then I had figured out a plan and so Sean puts his arm around me he's like hey I don't want to put too much pressure on you, but you have to be in charge now. You have to do this, and I was like mother F. charge he goes, but if you don't like you know what the kids want to do you know that you have the ability, for your parents to listen to you. folks are like Okay, but I don't want to be like."
107.0,Provider,yeah bossy pants.
13868.0,Patient,"yeah so. anyways and now that i'm on several not several but a couple of hours out from that I can kind of see it and clearer perspective of I just have to define what that means, and I don't have to be bossy pants."
107.0,Provider,So it's not just daily intentions for yourself it's daily intentions for the whole crew.
13868.0,Patient,yeah. ooh I like that thought.
107.0,Provider,So before you head out for the day let's all get on the same page about what today is today Star Wars day and what that means and we're going to let the force be with us. And we're going to get through this day with joy and love in our heart and if a ride go sideways or something goes sideways we're here for the experience. And you know just kind of orient everybody to what does it mean to be in this day.
13868.0,Patient,Okay.
107.0,Provider,And there's always good people watching.
13868.0,Patient,it's true.
107.0,Provider,"and space watching because Disney is good at creating atmosphere so check out the atmosphere, if you get really tired of a particular space in the atmosphere and you need to wander off is that, how do you know when that's cool and when that's not cool."
13868.0,Patient,yeah that's true.
107.0,Provider,And then my dad has their kind of marching orders and then it's easier to navigate that and you don't have to be bossy pants in the moment because everybody's kind of three to the space.
13868.0,Patient,"Okay we'll do that, we already Sean and I were just talking about it earlier, and they have this new like. Okay, so remember my dad's on the Nice scooter. Right, we went to ride, one of the called star tours and you know super RAD rides very cool um but we roll up to be in the standby line and they're like no, you can go through the back entrance. and will give you. used to be called fast cars now it's just this whole wonky thing going on faster, so they like link up all of our bands and tell us come back afternoon, and then you can you'll have a lightning password there's an option that you can pay X amount of dollars per day per person. To where you get. That on certain that fast access to on. Certain things. And originally my mom and dad were like we can't really think of a ride that we want to pay that for when we can be in line. and play the game they didn't."
107.0,Provider,see the value yeah. Right and so now they see the value.
13868.0,Patient,"Exactly After this, the first rise of the resistance Ryan, or whatever me and shawn were like I don't give a shit how much like we like we we budgeted for this, we have a plan and it's worth it."
107.0,Provider,"And so I told my mom is good at least you you don't feel like you're going to waste your money, and it will make the experience better."
13868.0,Patient,"yeah and that's another thing when Sean told me that I was in charge, now I was like and I had my minute to lie and I literally stepped away and was like okay get it together. What wouldn't tell you to do. And so, when I came back, I was like I I think it'd be worth our money and sean's like i'm not arguing with you and I was like just. Let me justify it because that's what I."
107.0,Provider,Right right. Baby steps I got to hear I got to play this out just let me play out the tape and then we can go pay the money or whatever it.
13868.0,Patient,"Is I said. yeah and he was like okay so, then I told my mom was like listen here's what we're doing tomorrow we're happy to pay for you guys, if you want to she's like we can cover it i'm like. I know, but you guys didn't want to do it. Right and I don't want to I don't want to carry you feeling like I pushed you into it. sure when he didn't want to do it she's like no will we see Ben she was like no I speak for your father. We I make the decisions for him, like Okay, then that's what we'll do. So it doesn't feel better, but at the moment I was like. This is exactly what I didn't want to happen here."
107.0,Provider,"Lisa happen right away, you could speak to it right away, and you can come up with a plan now so, then the rest of the trip can be more manageable hopefully."
13868.0,Patient,"yeah i'm hoping, so as far as this new person coming in goes um we had heard that she was supposed to meet us at the park this morning, but no, we never heard. Ask either because. I don't it's not my business my i'm not gonna make."
107.0,Provider,he's not your person. You don't need to manage her. yeah. yeah exactly she's in the in Part B crew exactly.
13868.0,Patient,you're over there.
107.0,Provider,yeah too dismissive I was trying to create space that became kind of weird. Thank you for rolling.
13868.0,Patient,Your own kids.
107.0,Provider,Exactly.
13868.0,Patient,"But she's I guess she's gonna meet us for dinner, maybe I don't know and the only thing I said was because we didn't have you have to make reservations, for everything, thanks to come in."
107.0,Provider,yeah.
13868.0,Patient,"And we weren't able to make reservations, for every. Which is fine, I like having that. Freedom and if i'm given the opportunity I I will overthink it so i'm glad to have some sort of not ability to do that. Right take it out of my control."
107.0,Provider,There you go.
13868.0,Patient,"But my dad was like we could go back to Disney springs which there's tons of restaurants, that you can just kind of walk in and."
107.0,Provider,Oh good.
13868.0,Patient,So I told him I still I saw a restaurant last night it's morimoto. And i'm a nerd and I love food network The irony is not lost on me. But he was one of the oh gee like iron chefs from iron. chef America.
107.0,Provider,I thought I thought I recognize the name yeah.
13868.0,Patient,"yeah that's him. he's got a restaurant here, so I was telling my dad is like i'm going to look at that and see if there's because we have to the don't like seafood and then of course i'm the walking allergy. And things like that so. Just look and see if there's even availability. yeah really didn't even leave it up for discussion I just said i'll do that."
107.0,Provider,yeah. yeah that's awesome.
13868.0,Patient,If not you know where we're staying we all have keys so.
107.0,Provider,yeah.
13868.0,Patient,"So it feels good to be not just that I feel like I have the ability to speak up for myself, but that i'm being heard."
107.0,Provider,yeah that's huge. it's just the land.
13868.0,Patient,"yeah it's very bizarre but I did email. rhonda and she had been loading of goals into my recovery record APP. Okay, like daily goals and I was asking her if we could talk about some of those to like for extra hold me accountable as far as like. i'm. not trying to say like mentally staying in the game. Because what I. Like I have all my snacks and I am doing all of that, but sometimes just the act of logging it. it's really helpful to kind of bring. Bringing the cradle extra accountability or ownership. yeah do you have any suggestions for those."
107.0,Provider,"For recovery record. Well, I think you know, being able to you know you acknowledge it right off the BAT with the desert and and just kind of acknowledging maybe there are some other. Exploring some other kind of cool opportunities that you wouldn't necessarily have exposure for because there's you're in a space where there's some unique stuff. So maybe seeking out the unique things and giving yourself permission to be a part of that experience, whatever that looks like for you. Okay, you know, like this restaurant opportunity or maybe some different stuff not maybe I mean I really like that idea of. hey we all have keys, and this is what i'm going to do, I think that that's a great opportunity for you to. explore kind of some food ownership, just because that's what you want to do and and not really worry about everybody else, maybe Sean takes the kids and goes and does something and. You have a meal with yourself, or whoever wants to join you and and you get to enjoy that."
13868.0,Patient,Okay it's a good idea.
107.0,Provider,"Because I mean you're in a unique opportunity there, so it would be a good an opportunity for some good challenges and even just to give yourself permission to do your own thing around food would be a big deal."
13868.0,Patient,yeah for sure they have a whole gluten free bakery.
107.0,Provider,"Oh, I would imagine they would be pretty gluten free friendly, given that this has been a thing for a while and they want to be able to support their patrons so it seems like it would be pretty gluten friendly."
13868.0,Patient,"it's but even in the last, the last time we were here was. Four years ago ish me personally, have been here and even since then, it feels like it's just exploded and good like for lunch it's a little bit ago they had I freakin chicken strips you know, like."
107.0,Provider,i've had like live Joe so did they have like separate Friars and separate kind of batter and everything.
13868.0,Patient,"Nice that's fantastic from what this little tiny, tiny but in your mind or in my mind, it was this tiny place. When I walked up to get the mobile order or whatever they have their own designated allergy chefs. So she came over and she was like she was accidentally made you to basket so Merry Christmas. And I was like I might cry because you know how long it's been since i've had. even been able to acknowledge the fact that I wanted it and I didn't feel guilty about it. like that in and of itself was enough to like make me super emotional like. holy shit I don't know."
107.0,Provider,"Maybe write about that in recovery record to you know, there might be these kind of unique opportunities that come up that you didn't even plan for and just being able to share that with rhonda would be nice."
13868.0,Patient,Okay i'll do that for sure now that I have a minute to kind of. and
107.0,Provider,yeah and that's part of the experience to write as being able to relish the moments.
13868.0,Patient,Definitely. I didn't I soon as you said that it occurred to me my mom her little bouncing off the wall like keystone COPs running into each other um she made a comment that she's working. So even her and I get I mean she's she's a CFO she's a little busy. um any of the year and stuff so maybe like it's not that she.
107.0,Provider,Did she's working while you on the trip.
13868.0,Patient,"And I kind of now it's making sense why she's being flighty. That actually might be. helpful for her if I go ahead and do what my natural inclination is, which is like let's provide some sort of guideline here."
107.0,Provider,yeah we.
13868.0,Patient,Have variation but.
107.0,Provider,"So maybe it would be all that more important to set up, not just an intentions but also like a highlight reel the end of each day, so that everybody can be kind of connected to the moment. Of the experience, because I really like the idea of the whole point of this trip is the experience and so ways to bring out the connection to the experience will help everybody. Because we can all get so caught up in something you just it's hard to hold on to things, but if you are allowed to kind of slow down and think about what's going on that helps you hold on to the you know hold on to the experience and own it."
13868.0,Patient,"Okay that's a good weekend because we're the opening up our packages, the shirt for the next day that can be."
107.0,Provider,"Very good. yeah you can talk about the highlights and then maybe even what you're looking forward to, or maybe even do the intentions. At the same time, I mean I don't know how volatile that will be, but I mean it's an opportunity, potentially, in that way, everybody kind of everybody remember what your intentions are yep okay."
13868.0,Patient,move forward seize the day. Right okay yeah I like that a lot.
107.0,Provider,And maybe they all need to pack some of their own snacks.
13868.0,Patient,"Oh, I already said that. ended over. Luckily, I think the whole thing started, because I was sitting at my pretzels and I was like. Sure, there were injured."
107.0,Provider,And they're like.
13868.0,Patient,"Well, damn it is mama bear again."
107.0,Provider,yeah oh goodness.
13868.0,Patient,Your puppy is awful lovey.
107.0,Provider,"Today, are ridiculous i'm not really clear what is happening for these two one was outside so he's have plenty of time to be outside, but apparently he needs attention and the other one i'm not really sure like."
13868.0,Patient,it's ridiculous just literally like.
107.0,Provider,"hey just get off and they you know, the more I do that the more they're like what."
13868.0,Patient,"We need you. yeah when we uh we left adrienne's. i'm such a baby um I don't leave her very often because i'm. Not overnight. yeah but to leave her we left her by herself until sean's parents literally drove across town town to get her it wasn't there for days or anything in it, you would have thought in my mind we're leaving her for the whole trip by herself. In this House, that she could potentially shredded to pieces. And so I would get the card I just look into shorter welled up it feels like are you okay it's like I never even tried or I left my kids. I was very much like by but with her and she's I don't know she's not needy. But my father in law has been sending us pictures so she's fine she managed to. OK, so my in laws are living with my mother in law's parents they're in their 90s, so they need they're not completely need meat Assisted Living but."
107.0,Provider,At least someone around.
13868.0,Patient,yeah so they stay with them all the time and they all they had just have a little tiny dogs.
107.0,Provider,Oh.
13868.0,Patient,"So they have this little tiny dog door. My father in law was perfectly prepared and willing to be able to go and open and close this door for audrey when she know. She can't get into or she is getting. herself. She won't do it, she wants to like challengers."
107.0,Provider,So you tried to get is.
13868.0,Patient,No. she's pushing through.
107.0,Provider,Oh wow.
13868.0,Patient,"It is like. You know, like the standard size doggie door it's just maybe two inches smaller than that so it's not like a mouse door or anything but it's just funny he's tried to send me a video of it, and he started laughing so it wasn't a long video. I was like well, she was adopting that's good."
107.0,Provider,that's hilarious.
13868.0,Patient,"Well, children, I have well adopting."
107.0,Provider,dogs oh. Every race just rolling well you're probably doing the same it's just hard to appreciate it in the moment.
13868.0,Patient,"It is, I, but having said that i've seen you even my mom has said. That she's she's seen change in me and she's just one of those changes that I i'm going to say I did a good job, hiding, and now, but I, we all know, thoughts in my head and if they don't live with me so a lot of it is new for them. So a little bit of a shock when I first was telling them like how bad it was."
107.0,Provider,huh.
13868.0,Patient,"And then, then being like you're like honest about a lot of things like vocal and advocate for myself and. As opposed to just kind of mouse away from like I would never, never have said, can we not talk about food like that. ever so that alone, and then, of course, later on, I was like I felt like an ass did I, like my tone of voice, and he was like no. Of course. his ears are different but. Right take it cuz my mom would have been like that came across kind of rude but she didn't say it was good, just as they're smiling at me."
107.0,Provider,Good job honey.
13868.0,Patient,yeah she gets it she understands it and it's probably because I tell her obviously I told her more than I told my dad but yeah I think he's he's absorbing more than I give him credit for two so.
107.0,Provider,sounds like it sounds like he's trying it's awesome.
13868.0,Patient,"yeah for sure. And I had to declare, last night I was going to tell you. That i've never had nuclear ever."
107.0,Provider,And it.
13868.0,Patient,"was a gluten free one me and shawn shared it. Because interest on fashion right before we have dinner is when he is he will die if he doesn't get any food in his system, he can't function it's super hilarious like, why do you like to get this far gone. it's like I don't know but never again. So anyways we just were walking around and we found. We stumbled across this gluten free bakery and I was like i'll be back oh yeah."
107.0,Provider,"So, what are your opinions about and claire's. Do they need to stay in your life."
