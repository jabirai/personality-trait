And it should take about a year to a year and a half, it just depends on how compliant you are and i've noticed i'm not very it's hard to be compliant snack frequently throughout the day you know i'm one of those i'm more of a grazer."
252.0,Provider,yeah.
11503.0,Patient,"You have to take it out every time you eat you can only have it in with water. So morning coffee breakfast i'm not used to doing it that way, and you still like Oh, I want to have a coffee it kind of makes you think about it more."
252.0,Provider,yeah.
11503.0,Patient,"Because you want to take it out, you know they just pop out but. they're Okay, you can fill them adjusting you can feel like they're really tight or your teeth are almost sore afterwards. But it, it makes me talk with a list."
252.0,Provider,Okay.
11503.0,Patient,"What about hopefully i'm pretty teeth and it'll be worth it. When i'm on the go and i've been here i've i've had the trays for a while now, and I had to move back my first appointment because you have like week one week two week three but to get through week one and move on to week to you have to have like close to 20 hours."
252.0,Provider,frustrating. yeah oh. I bet do you sleep with him in.
11503.0,Patient,yeah yeah. I mean let's say I get seven hours sleep and I just got to where i'm 13. Hours just still a lot.
252.0,Provider,is still a lot.
11503.0,Patient,"So it makes me think twice before putting something in my mouth, because I have to take these darn things out."
252.0,Provider,I really want that.
11503.0,Patient,i'm like I gotta do it we've already paid the money my husband's like we need to you need to wear them. off anyways i'm a little it's not my favorite thing but hey it'll be worth it.
252.0,Provider,"Yes, right remember."
11503.0,Patient,"hired today, I feel tired."
252.0,Provider,Now is going with you.
11503.0,Patient,"Had a lot going on as well, and so I know you mean everything's good everything's really good um I just feel like i'm thankful i'm not working right now very thankful. Because we have our House remodel going, and now the whole House is being painted so we've had a lot of workers here and a lot of decisions that have to be made kind of managing the project, a little bit you know."
252.0,Provider,there's.
11503.0,Patient,"A lot going on with that, but we're in our last like two two to three weeks Max hopefully two weeks we'll have a new kitchen so it'll be worth it. yeah it's we went out of town, this weekend, so my family, it was really good but that's always hard there's my husband's birthday, but he had a golfing plan with his friends to tahoe and they had a nice time, so he did that, and then I took my daughter by myself to bakersfield which is."
252.0,Provider,Like.
11503.0,Patient,four and a half hours drive.
252.0,Provider,She just really stresses me out sometimes like.
11503.0,Patient,"Everything is difficult i'm in the process of i've talked to a couple therapists for her. And there's, one that does both some talk therapy if they're bonding and she's wanting to open up, but more play therapy she's filming seven. But her doctors recommending cognitive behavioral therapy for her that's The one thing, she said, and this therapist I found that does have availability via Tele health which Tele health for play therapy I don't know how that works. yeah I mean how effective is that going to be for my seven year old."
252.0,Provider,it's a struggle.
11503.0,Patient,"But she needs to like at least i'm learning good things for me and I try to teach her like the breathing staff to stop and that man, she is so emotional and just the smallest thing will just like trigger this meltdown. I videotaped her the other. day I made sure she didn't see me just so I could show the therapist or her doctor, it was over a be in the pool, and she starts like. Full on tantrum like just hysterical on the ground. It doesn't always happen that severe, but she like has zero control of our emotions. I love her dearly but she is a challenge the mornings or a challenge some days are better than others so i've noticed she really causes my anxiety level to spike."
252.0,Provider,So.
11503.0,Patient,"Like that i'm feeling very i'm feeling a lot of anxiety today, but we had a rougher morning here."
252.0,Provider,That makes it tough to you know when the kids wake up and. Sorry go ahead. yeah.
11503.0,Patient,"It does it's like Okay, and I noticed and i'm like i'm have more anxiety."
252.0,Provider,But she doesn't listen she does.
11503.0,Patient,"Let me help her half the time just got sensory stuff going on, too, so when the crease has to be just perfect on her toe. And then, like it's really a challenge, I almost feel like nothing she's special needs, I mean I feel for people that have like full blown like down syndrome, or you know something that's a lot more. Because it's hard."
252.0,Provider,yeah toll on you.
11503.0,Patient,"um so i'm trying to get her in check and i've just noticed i'm doing better I feel good but it's hard when you're working on yourself and working on all these things, and then she causes it to. And I can't how do I avoid that I don't know um. But yeah. I am feeling more anxiety today why I do probably know why it's because we had a rougher morning and we barely got to school on time, like pulling teeth with her, you know she's like a turtle. She goes like extra slow like is she doing this on purpose. dropping her off and it we have painters here and stuff that needed to be moved has been a hectic morning that's probably why I feel anxious and I just need to do some deep breathing and Center myself."
252.0,Provider,yeah okay great ground yourself a little bit you know.
11503.0,Patient,"yeah I mean, I still have not um. I don't know why this is so hard it's probably hard because it's an addiction, but i've done much better with. The frequency of drinking like for a while I cut it out pretty much except like one day here and there, for a while I cut it out completely but. i'm such a social person it's really difficult we've been going out to dinner a lot, because we have no kitchen. So it was my husband's birthday and we we did have a little bit of Saki last night, but not to the point, like I know my I know my point i'm more much more aware, but I haven't 100% cut it out. So, like that's kind of what I want to talk to you about that and then. Mainly that I guess, I mean we can talk in general about other stuff so is that normal I mean is this typical like I can't compare myself to every person, but like I know in our group. isn't Michelle like she's been 100% sober and I don't know if she's been through therapy before like this is my first time doing this, so maybe i'm just like learning, this is i'm navigating and kind of learning as I go here. But I know for you guys The goal is to completely cut it out and that's where like the fine line is and I enjoy wine, and I am social so it's really hard, because I feel like those things go hand in hand, sometimes you can be social without it, yes, but do you get what i'm saying."
252.0,Provider,yeah.
11503.0,Patient,"I I go if everywhere and. and, especially, like a nice glass of wine if i've had like a busy day productive day it's kind of like an unwinding thing I like the taste of it, but I mean night and day from where I was to where I was like drinking very consistently and larger amounts like. pretty much daily like. i've made a lot of progress, from that point."
252.0,Provider,"But you can easily get right back to that point and that's the whole thing about when you're in the early stages right. I call it when you're in the early stages of. Almost walking to the cliff because, once you jump off that cliff and you find that you're addicted physically and psychologically it's all or nothing. yeah right. Right, so one might work right now but. The hope is you don't get to a point where you can't just have one. mm hmm because then you're on that you're on that slow so you've got."
11503.0,Patient,"Right now, I guess, I feel i'm i'm at that point where i'm aware and, for example, this weekend, we went home again it's everywhere we went home for my niece's birthday my."
252.0,Provider,sister's.
11503.0,Patient,"birthday party over there and all my family was there, and of course there there's wine. And they're respectful like they're asking you know. If you're not having any right now I mean they're aware, but I was able to have you know one maybe I have one and a half and most and I was fine, I think the management helped me there I don't feel the need to continue. I can just stop I can stop it it's no problem now, I know I cross that threshold and i've learned you can't mix right but we went to dinner last night, have a little bit of Saki I didn't want anymore, I was good. So your problem i'm sure you've been through all of this, so. it's not I guess it's not okay for me to do it occasionally and just have one like I feel like i've gotten to a point where. i'm okay with that you know I can stop instead of like getting agitated or feeling like I want to order another drink and i'm actually having cravings like i'm not experiencing that right now. yeah but it's more of a thing I think it's been such a part of my life, which sounds terrible but like when we go out to. Or we share a small Saki my husband orders that we have a small small literally between him and I and he'll get a beer and he'll pour a little bit of a beer. If i'm going to drink if I want some not without me saying you know, but a small Saki just a very little amount and then i'm you know we have. tears and happy birthday, it was his birthday, so we went out to celebrate his birthday, but. But his I guess what i'm getting out like is that not Okay, is there, people that that works for or do I just have to go cool to working on i'm kind of."
252.0,Provider,"Like figure this out. there's nothing to figure out. Okay first off you don't overthink it. Okay, and."
11503.0,Patient,make me feel a little bit like because i'm not completely abstaining because I feel like with this program that's what i'm supposed to do.
252.0,Provider,that's the end. result by.
11503.0,Patient,Failing.
252.0,Provider,"I don't know that's the hope and that's The end result you know, there are people that can drink one you know one drink every now and then and be perfectly fine and there are other people that cannot that they're you know they develop this addiction. And it's there's a predisposition for it, so if it's in your family unit somewhere. you've got the gene."
11503.0,Patient,Right right.
252.0,Provider,"So you wake that gene and you're headed down that that you know that path. yeah so you've got who you know, remember that piece to this is about you this isn't about me what is in the best interest for you what he'll right, and if you feel that you can handle drinking a beer every now and then or drinking a drink every now and then. By all means do it that's your choice, it just."
11503.0,Patient,Like you're saying it's very slippery slippery slippery slope.
252.0,Provider,can be a very simple.
11503.0,Patient,"process I go through when i'm in that situation there's little alcohol like I already tell myself like okay i'm going to have one two is like absolute Max. He you know, and I never I mean lately because i'm so much more aware and I realized, you know I slipped up a little bit and. Had a little bit too much when I got in the argument with my husband more than I should have I cross that point clearly so I know it's like I almost have a pep talk with myself and my head. And I know. hey i'm just going to have one to Max like my sister I want, and then, of course, she was buzzed and feeling good and she's like oh. yeah i'm gonna give you a little refill but you know what I did I had because she can she's good my husband, she was really uptight so my husband her husband, excuse me, my brother in law said. giving me some wine, because she was really uptight he's the one he's 100% sober now he used to have a problem, but for her it's not an issue anyways long story short, my glass was too full fuller I poured it in hers. i've left a very little bit. Because I didn't want I was at my point. No, I think my thoughts are totally different than like I never even I don't think was aware or lost sight of that. And went away from that like before, but now that i've been doing all this work, I have a totally different view going into it, I try to set myself up for success went to the bunker night. One glass of wine, all the other girls got pretty tipsy not everybody, but I was probably the most sober person there you know and and I was good and I felt great the next morning so. i've come far in that aspect so it's just like I guess you said it's what works for me and. it's a pressure I didn't do that before I couldn't do that i'd keep. It flow, you know I glass of wine we're having a good time and refills."
252.0,Provider,"And i'm not remember that if you find yourself in these. You know these continued explosions. Right mm hmm and if you find yourself continually going overboard you might want to not drink it all. Right right. Right um, but if you can you know if you feel that you can manage and one or two, and you can cut yourself off and not go into you know that zone you're done. and You know what I mean then your phone, but just you got to keep an eye on you know, on all of those aspects."
11503.0,Patient,"that's why like I won't even have line here like wine bottles here, yes I occasionally will get the cans because i'll just have one can. He not have more than that it's easier to like know they have these like zero sugar ones now they're supposed to be healthier and and I even tried for a while there's one that the alcohols removed, but you still get the taste. yeah. it's there's no alcohol in it and, but it still tastes like you know, so I could have those in my fridge to just just like backups but the cam thing helps because. I can just have one can and i'm good with that and I don't go for a second one, and again it's and i'm just trying to figure this out, I guess, and you said there's no figuring out i'm probably overthinking it."
252.0,Provider,You are but.
11503.0,Patient,"Is there a right answer or wrong, I guess is."
252.0,Provider,"There okay that's black and white thinking okay you got to look at the Gray right because it's. Are you possibly on the verge of creating an addiction. that's what you've got to figure out what is telling you that you can manage it. You know, and if it's something that you truly believe in, you can have one or two then then do what's in your best interest."
11503.0,Patient,yeah I was kind of curious from your experience when people you know I guess at the point that i'm in when I started this um are similar to me. Is this a normal path when you're trying to cut it out completely. Or do people just go cold. Turkey and there's no problem and they're not.
252.0,Provider,"There you always are going to go through. some kind of struggle. As far as. Can I have one can I not have one, is this enough, is this too much. If you know your limits your boundary and you stick to your boundary. There should be no problem right. But if you continue your mind."
11503.0,Patient,"During regular work like this to this how I mean this helps a lot, but I want you to continue what you're going to say if I."
252.0,Provider,"If you continually find yourself going overboard find yourself drinking more than two. And it's leading to marriage destruction right, then you might want to quit all together. yeah because that won't stop yeah that will continue. No matter what kind of alcohol you're drinking. No matter what. yeah okay. So I have seen people get to this point and be able to you know really they're really struggling with the whole thing. And i've seen people get to this point and are able to maintain one or two and then just quit altogether because why. Right and then i've seen people maintained for a while and then fall right back into the pattern of the drinking more and the arguing and fighting and all of that stuff i've seen people lose their marriage i've seen people lose everything over it. So. You know what side of the fence, do you want I don't know right, you know that's that's something to be told."
11503.0,Patient,"Looking things that I mean I definitely recognized. I guess it's like this pattern right because are kind of yeah pattern I after the big argument we had it was like I will not let alcohol destroy America. I will not, I realized the importance of me never getting to that point and not mixing because then my inhibitions are down and i'm more likely to have more right if i've had like a gum years but. I am, like the anxiety that helps me, but like when my daughter really stresses me out I feel like and I know it's doing the opposite, but having a glass of wine is good, is to me is like okay I deserve this and maybe this is what goes on in the head. And I complain so much about my. daughter, because I love her to pieces. Listen stress."
252.0,Provider,Stress me out every day. Okay ADHD 10 year old and a five year old that is ruled the roost you trying to get them to have.
11503.0,Patient,"You yeah. is tight just cleaned explosion like I it's hard for me to get organized and clean, because I have add myself."
252.0,Provider,Yes.
11503.0,Patient,"But i've been really working on getting our house in order to create less stress. And a good environment, so I was everything on the home front, has just been very good."
252.0,Provider,"it's just you know it's a difficult, you know with our sensory it has she ever been tested for autism spectrum we haven't. i'm just curious."
11503.0,Patient,yeah maybe maybe that's something we should look at.
252.0,Provider,"And then, because i'll tell you, if she falls on the bull has her teachers recommended any kind of testing for it."
11503.0,Patient,"No, no, she got diagnosed with ADHD um but her doctor has not, I know her doctors, on her behavior last time we were in was an in person, and she was like ultra shy, but then she was trying to get the doctors attention she just like almost like the wrong type of behavior right to get attention. stuff that's going to upset me or what's that called defiance disorder I think she has some. biases one because i'm. In maybe meet there is some. Maybe that's something we should look at."
252.0,Provider,yeah because i'll do not.
11503.0,Patient,"been suggested or. I think her doctor I could tell last visit she was kind of like my daughter had gone out of the room to go pick them the toy box and. She kind of saw she said, you know I think she's got really high anxiety and she suggested a MED initially but we're not ready to go down that route we do did do a MED for ADHD."
252.0,Provider,"make a difference, you."
11503.0,Patient,"forgot to take it, I put it by her. Cereal bowl by her breakfast in the morning on Saturday we were with my mom and grandma and she was really not behaving like in the car, we were all in the car together. And just she just talks really loud like she has I think it's an attention thing but anyway, she does the wrong types of things and. is really, really annoying sometimes like she's going to annoy the hell out of people, I mean that in the nicest way possible, but she's going to destroy friendships because. She if she doesn't get her way or over the littlest thing she's in tears and it's just like people that like scares people want to go like this. So I don't want that to happen, but anyways she forgot to take our MED and then we went to watch a game of my nephew was playing flag football. And we had some time before my niece's volleyball game, it was very back to back, but it was a really good weekend. And I got to go watch them we did the party we went to church Sunday, which was great we went to brunch me my sister my mom and grandmother after church the kids were with my brother in law. And it was a really good weekend but anyhow, we went right after that five football game my mom we forgot to take the MED and realize that and she was not behaving, and so we went back and took the MED and you could tell how much she calmed down after that. My mom was like wow she totally noticed. yeah she's. been great now i'm like well she took her medicine. mm hmm so it's she's on conservative same thing i'm taking lower dose of course but. um yeah I think her doctor like I could see the wheels turning that like maybe. Something I don't know that she said along the spectrum, but she may have mentioned that I feel like I heard those words and she was like kind of trying to figure it out and she said let's start with the cognitive and see how that goes, but she could tell her behavior was a little off."
252.0,Provider,yeah.
11503.0,Patient,"And she does, I think she's just trying to get attention, but in the wrong ways. And she'll just like grabbed my boobs. or or lift my shirt up like it's horrible i'm like at the pharmacy i'm like honey like. you're right under my shirts. What are you doing you can't do this. So."
252.0,Provider,"because some of the things that you're mentioning in her behavior I have a really close friend who's a little boy. turns out was on is on the autism spectrum right though, and he has sensory issues too. um and they the schools really given her a lot of tools to be able to work with him. And how to you know, make it different so that you know he's not throwing those fits because he has got a. Oh, my God this kid has got a scream like no other, and you just go, because you know."
11503.0,Patient,"Worrying those like my daughter, she has all this pent up anger i'm like where's this coming from like really good life if anything we've spoiled her too much he's an only child, you know but she's very loved and but she's so challenging nothing, nothing can be easy."
252.0,Provider,"it's like come on easy. Just know that if she seven she has no idea how to regulate any emotions, so if she's angry what's driving that anger. Frustration right."
11503.0,Patient,Once you felt left out at the party we this was the only negative but i'm used to it by now she was in tears i'm fat i'm ugly. because she got called fat in kindergarten.
252.0,Provider,"Oh, my God."
11503.0,Patient,"it's horrible horrible I mean she was that we switch to private and not that that's going to solve this solutions we switch for other reasons he needed to repeat because she was behind but. Then school just wanted to keep pushing forward we expressed our concern and they're like no I think she's fine last two teachers that happened with and zoom On top of that she's the youngest in our class. So she didn't assessment at a private school, we were on a waitlist for a year, they finally had an opening that she had to do an assessment as part of the process, they said, with the principal and he said hands down she needs to repeat. And really what we thought were like Okay, because she she so hard on herself at such a young age, but the poor thing in kindergarten and she is shy asked some girls to play with her and they said no you're fat. And that is stuck with her, I cried that night I mean I didn't let her see that me upset I was like we don't want to play with those girls, you know it, but my my heart just broke."
252.0,Provider,yeah because those are the. Things.
11503.0,Patient,"You know the when she goes into when she feels left out so she felt left out at this party cuz she idolizes my niece. she's like just loves it, you know, wants to be just like it idolizes um and her friends were there so her friends were playing with her and. She she's at a different age, you know, like they do different things and she's like I feel so left out, she wanted to go home miss Daddy we had to facetime Daddy i'm fat i'm ugly and then she goes down that path."
252.0,Provider,yeah.
11503.0,Patient,"so hard on herself and I just. My God i'm thinking God I we're going to end up with a tremendous with an eating disorder we tell her how beautiful she is. that's not true either that's not true, why do you say these things, so I don't think she feels good in her own skin."
252.0,Provider,Number one not.
11503.0,Patient,"To put on a little bit of weight, but she's beautiful she said mommy, why did God make me why did God make me this way. Oh hard it's been this like I want her self esteem, to be up she's a really good swimmer when she's swimming that helps her so much, but it's offseason. And big difference with behavior. But she's really like. Talking kind of baby like like you know she could send a baby voice sometimes like maybe not all the time, but i'm just thinking this autism you got my my wheels turning a little bit."
252.0,Provider,Something to evaluating this will look at ask the pediatrician you know their.
11503.0,Patient,Emotions like the unregulated emotions related there. yeah.
252.0,Provider,"I asked the teacher her teacher, you know what do you think you know because I know my friend. The minute that he got into headstart or headstart. They were telling your kid or you can you possibly go and get him assessed, because we think that you know he has I don't think he's a full blown you know that he has full blown."
11503.0,Patient,"It along the spectrum my neighbors has it and I remember them going through the whole process with them. And now. it's all paid for, and you know they got an actual diagnosis had to go through."
252.0,Provider,"yeah because school think about it, because school is tough already with somebody that has ADHD it is it's just tough and if there's other things going on, that you don't know about it can be 10 times tougher."
11503.0,Patient,Okay interesting okay.
252.0,Provider,You know.
11503.0,Patient,"mention that because we're just like sometimes we're you know it's like we do everything in our power to make sure it's a smooth morning, you know but, like, I have to buy special underwear socks like she doesn't wear half for clothes, because they don't feel right on her."
252.0,Provider,"yep that's exactly Christopher oh my gosh Okay, it has to have certain and there's one blanket he will sleep with. He has to go to sleep in the exact same place every night. every night, you know, there are certain things that they have to do their routine has to be you know the same."
11503.0,Patient,"Oh she's very much like that, like we're going somewhere, we have to be out the door and she's like my dog my Lol dollar after dress my dog like let's worry about either right now we don't need to this is an important but in her mind it's so important."
252.0,Provider,"Yes, she."
11503.0,Patient,breaks down goes into a frenzy if it's not done.
252.0,Provider,mm hmm i'm exactly.
11503.0,Patient,i'm going to check this out.
252.0,Provider,And he's there.
11503.0,Patient,"for saying that because I mean who knows, but there's some similar similarities, we just want we just want some answers and so."
252.0,Provider,"yeah you just want imagine. If you find out that that is the case that opens up a whole new world for her to be able to end for you to be able to learn, you know the the tools to be that's going to work best for her right, you know. that's the amazing part."
11503.0,Patient,"wow well that's um. I will, maybe her next doctor's appointment, but I could tell like we weren't even able to talk about it it's hard, maybe I should just schedule a phone console with her because Eva was there."
252.0,Provider,She just went back so it's like you can only have a few minutes yeah.

252.0,Provider,yeah I know.
11503.0,Patient,"i've had a lot of loss and like i've a lot of people looking out for me. And for me it's like always a comfort um, but I think they would think it was like. satanic or you know, some people that are open minded to other things."
252.0,Provider,yeah don't believe in.
11503.0,Patient,"You shouldn't mess with that I don't see it like that, because it's not not like this double thing. it's no use for."
252.0,Provider,"Mike Let me take my experience. yeah alright so. This is disclosure right, so a little personal information. I in 2001 I had a 18 month old grandson the died in corporate oh my God okay. So either. We moved from phoenix Arizona to Washington Oregon area and we were in Oregon and I was in the bath than him and he used to always jump in my back. There was just his thing he is a swimmer he loved water just loved it he could swim in the pool 18 months old he was that you know we lived in the desert that's all there was to do is put him in the water, so i'm i'm in the bath and. What he used to always do was flip the switch to the water drain. and So that was something that we would all you know, he would always do, and i'd be like, no, no don't do it, you know."
11503.0,Patient,Right right.
252.0,Provider,"Well i'm in the bath by myself and it's within the year after he died, I mean literally probably six months after he died i'm in the bath and the thing goes down. No, and then I pick it up and then it goes down again. And i'm sitting there and i'm like what the hell not taking several thousand that bath and that didn't happen."
11503.0,Patient,Oh yeah. Oh yeah it's not like.
252.0,Provider,A drain no.
11503.0,Patient,I have chills up and down my whole body.
252.0,Provider,"I finally got it that, yes, I believe in angels now second thing another full disclosure 2017 I had a four month old grandson the data sets. Oh so. going through the last you know i'm thinking I just got over the first one, it took me over seven years before I could even process, the loss this one, I had a dream that Evan which was this brother was holding nathaniel. And that he was saved. And it just made me feel I just got this overwhelming feel that he is safe he's good. wow help my grieving happy walkthrough so much better because I just knew."
11503.0,Patient,"yeah. hundred percent I believe in all of that stuff I think there's no doubt I. am sorry for your loss, but that is very um yeah I feel this like overwhelming sense of. I just got chills up and down yeah I they were sending you a sign that they were OK."
252.0,Provider,But I think two.
11503.0,Patient,or Evan you know was saying hi like hey we used to do this together hey i'm good like it was like their way of telling you.
252.0,Provider,"that's what I yeah very much. um, and so it made me really walk through you know a little bit."
11503.0,Patient,"Based on your own experience it's like but it's probably that comforting feeling of knowing like. Who wouldn't want to have be surrounded by angels, you know I got people looking out for me and there's been a lot of them, I mean I felt could write a book on my life but there's been a lot of different crazy things that have happened that you would never imagine happening. And we tried talking about that a little bit last weekend. Or was two weekends ago i'm not this past, but the one before. With my girlfriends I started opening up about some of the loss, I had had. But like axes because I lost two significant axis and I hadn't talked about it a long time I just like I got emotional I didn't mean to I just came out because I don't talk about it a lot but. yeah I feel like those all those signs are make you feel good it's not like I told a good friend of mine who's a strong Christian not like super strong but she's a Christian and she's like oh alley be careful with that stuff because they. don't know about it, I don't think they're educated on it, nor have they probably had any of those experiences."
252.0,Provider,"Right or they were blind to them on what's happening, you know when you're when you're open to seeing things and you catch it repeat, you know repeated one one ones repeated things there's a reason it's like, why is that happening, why do I continually see that, like wow."
11503.0,Patient,"I wanted I don't even mean are they trying to like send a message, what is the message mean right, I was so was and I probably did sound could go, I mean I didn't share it with many people because. My my girlfriend when we're having this conversation two weekends ago and she sees and number two and she had just done this big ride to support. Her husband's a firefighter and they cycled across the state across how many miles they went to New York from here and raise money for the 911 victims or. It was a it was a fundraiser for that right there was, I think, like 343 firefighters that died so ever since she she cycled with him for 500 miles of it, she went and met him, and then they were in New York at the end. And she kept saying 343 after that, over and over it was a different number, but after. That it was like it's just weird. And she's like I might sound crazy I was like no you're not going to sound crazy because I same thing happens to me. it's like when different things are going on in my life when things are really rocking with my husband I kept seeing this. number in the meeting was like you're going to go come up to a path that's going to go one way or the other, you have to make some hard decisions, and you know big life changes. And we were going through some real and then I lost my Papa was like a dad to me when we were probably at our worst point so I was grieving and having a really hard time with that loss. yeah but i'm i'm like these are these are science, you know, and it was like you're not alone, you can do this. So it was interesting and the lady told me to to do you're surrounded by angels and you're very intuitive so."
252.0,Provider,I don't know and she did the Chakra thing and setting ascending and.
11503.0,Patient,"i'm at a really good point in my life, so I feel like i've learned a lot of lessons and I am open to it. So we'll see how far it goes."
