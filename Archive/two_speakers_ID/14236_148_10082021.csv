14236.0,Patient,"honest answer and I felt like shit. Just very, very. i'm out there i'm have a limit mm hmm okay. You just can't do it anymore."
148.0,Provider,yeah.
14236.0,Patient,"Everything is going wrong. and I thought I honestly feel so stupid because they look like, if I look at my life up into this point April like an idiot for credit they could otherwise I really thought that this year was gonna be different, because I got out of an abusive situation, so I thought, like. But it's the exact same feeling they felt like. They have it on one I feel completely empty. I have like. i'm being turned in very, very cold. I got nothing left to go, I gave everything I could I did. And I am I have nothing left that I can possibly feel anymore I just told them dumb."
148.0,Provider,What sounds like getting out of that abusive relationship with a huge step for you and a huge step forward i'm a very positive thing in your life.
14236.0,Patient,"is totally what was the point of leave it if I stole gonna. Other the fact like Of course I will acknowledge it or not, if I didn't leave I wouldn't have met. A love of my life, who I even work anymore, but if I didn't leave, then I would have been stuck in that same place, but I still have that. It just feels like I just rather deal with that because, at least with that. I felt shitty for a reason now it's like I feel like crap and I want to die, and actually I have a very well thought out suicide plan i'm trying to talk myself out of."
148.0,Provider,Okay okay well let's talk about that what is your plan to harm yourself.
14236.0,Patient,"Last time I tried to kill myself in it pretty much worked I overdose. So I was going to overdose in my rest. Because I wasn't going to tell anyone. And I live alone. it's hard to get in my apartment building. So it's like if I was to overdose, no one would find me, and I would die. I honestly I don't think anyone would necessarily care if I did it anyway. So."
148.0,Provider,it's a painful place to be. Painful feeling to have.
14236.0,Patient,"So, no one gives a shit when i'm here. No one gives a shit when i'm around. Because it's like. When before, when I was talking about my feelings it's like oh my gosh being closed up oh let's cut Michael long talk about how crappy is communicating things, even though, and like completely shut me out because I didn't want to talk about things. Then, when they do. Talk about things and it's like I feel like i'm talking too much about page so it's like I can't win. I got my heart broken recently my friend died a couple months ago. by other bread literally called like she basically was like well you're a piece of shit because. You want your little brother, to have a better life and you're telling me that have been with you it's gonna be like give a have a worst life like I just like I don't get it. it's like i'm struggling so much right now and. I had one person that they really, really, really, really, really. Thought will be there for me. And he's not even here. Everything is going. So wrong so pass. i'm probably gonna get evicted from my apartment. I can't find a job. by Bob late relapse. i'm tired. love to give you more. love it be, I have no. passion, because, like all of his heart into like hey. Did I would rather die before I hate anyone. I would rather be dead than filter how I feel I don't want to feel like I don't want. To be dead. Because, at least when I did. It wouldn't matter to me one time that. I wouldn't be in pain anymore. You, to be more to be paid. By. God i'm sorry for my late but."
148.0,Provider,"that's okay that's Okay, I appreciate you letting it all out right now. Michael. Do you have anything worth living for right now."
14236.0,Patient,"Though. appointed time I did. It like I don't really tell people that like. I heard one thing I was like. I was like this is is maybe they want to keep going and getting my life together like even before we met I was like I stole it, I have my life together. But like. I did, but now it's like all of it doesn't matter anymore."
148.0,Provider,"heartbreak is so painful it's so painful but. I believe that you can walk through it. And you have bright heart now. So you have somebody to talk to whenever you need it we're here for you we're here to support you and I know I only just met you, but I care I care if you're not here."
14236.0,Patient,"there's year that it was like. A barely have any friends, but the ones that I thought were by friends it's like. Only one really just. She just constantly is like, and when I tell her like hey What do you do this. It bothers me. It is, I will. This is why i'm like I don't like talking about my boobs a house because it's like she uses that as like for real like oh i'm excusing how I treated you because you're too sensitive or like Oh, because, like, I have a hard time grasping social. Situations us is that it is like already feel bad because I don't know how to tackle that stuff and it's like I just like 22 or 23 and. You know, learning that I might be autistic so it's like okay i'm trying to deal with that do you help me out here don't make me feel like shit. But what I did tell her yesterday that I was like i'm done with the friendships she came to my house and I wish you luck my house, I felt even more like shit because it's kind of like. i'm telling you I told her last night, like, I told her last night, like I have at the end of my rope and i'm almost like I just I don't want to do shit anymore like I don't. I can't do it anymore i'm probably going to kill myself and then basically getting all like feeling validated be like why everybody's going through shit I go. To but like I get that I get that I understand, and I am I sympathize well not much anymore, because I really can't feel that feeling anymore. I get it, but i'm telling you guys feeling suicidal you're basically telling me well, like So do I so who the Fuck cares. So it's like what I got up today, I was kind of like well. that's the confirmation, nobody gives a Fuck is shaped by live or die when I. My mom told me to count myself. Even when I went over there yesterday, trying to help her girls it's all star was like oh like I only get involved when shit like this was like no i'm always involved, they just try and backed away cuz I have my own life too. And it's like being told, like I especially like going through heartbreak and like. I was doing good from healing until everything started hitting and falling down and me, realizing how. Much I give and how much people take and how like I just started filling dream. yeah regard to heartbreak and have my mom's on the wall that's what you get I told you, no one really knew that that was fun that was nice because he's like. Painful yeah."
148.0,Provider,that's so painful you don't deserve that Michael.
14236.0,Patient,"Then it's like the shitty thing is for so long. I genuinely felt that no i'd love to be. I still kind of do but they're the one person that I thought, let me. broke my heart. Then. Just like I ignored that and then it just. have to have anything after me. I know I don't know how i'm supposed to keep going but it's like i'm back out rock bottom can do is think about my mom. Being a piece of shit towards me I feel alone in that aspect, because I have no family that I can call. I can't talk to like my best friend because also make that spread is my mom and she's going through her own stuff and also i'm just like I don't I i'm trying to figure a way to work out like. I can't talk to her, because I feel like when, at a point in time when I needed someone to talk to. I got fired because she was also my boss I got fired and then I got dragged from my communication skills and I was like it's just simply i'm bottling and beings that i'm dealing with and it's like instead of talking to me about it. I gotta treat it like shit. sucks it sucks."
