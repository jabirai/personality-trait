You know, it could be anything from you know I want to learn more about myself, I want to learn additional coping skills, you know i'm just throwing things out at you, you can tell me what do you hope to get out of the therapy."
18742.0,Patient,As oh okay i'm in general or this therapy session.
298.0,Provider,i'm in general.
18742.0,Patient,"In general um. Well, I definitely have. A lot of like communication issues, maybe. i'm really like I end up doing a lot for people, for fear of losing them more than sometimes I betrayed myself too much to please people and do stuff for my friends or people that I love. That are kind of like I wouldn't do it, but I still end up doing it and kind of drains my energy and and it has been detrimental for me a few times. mm hmm so maybe how to cope with that maybe how to fix stuff."
298.0,Provider,"How to have if we can put in a sentence, what would you say i'm wanting better, I want to learn different ways of communication and suddenly suddenly boundaries, with people around me."
18742.0,Patient,"Maybe yeah exactly like learn how to set boundaries, with people around me i'm. And how to be more I want to like. learn how to ask for what I want I know it sounds. weird but. I just feel like sometimes i'm not worthy of asking or or like deserving what I feel that is rude to ask for certain things that could have gotten me further in life but it's like a fear or like a shame of asking."
298.0,Provider,uh huh.
18742.0,Patient,"I can definitely be a thing is that affects especially my my career, like my professional life."
298.0,Provider,"now affects your career in your professional life okay. Okay, so learn to act for what I want maybe i'm trying to help you with narrowing down a goal with this, I do not feel deserving so maybe it's about valuing yourself. You know, to value myself, I want to feel. Worthy you know, like, I want to learn ways, you know identify my own self values does that sound good."
18742.0,Patient,yeah.
298.0,Provider,"identified three self values. Values okay. To ask for what I want Okay, and you know surfing okay identified three self values that."
18742.0,Patient,"You know, and how to do that without like being self centered or narcissistic you know how to do that and stay humble."
298.0,Provider,"Well, I feel like communicating your needs, as you know, it's it's really good to be able to do that, but just to know that. You are you know not being selfish you know, like i'm just gonna put that out there to say like this is what I need, and this is what I want. You know, sometimes we we get so used to giving and giving and giving down, we feel as though we're we can't receive you know those things back to us. yeah so being able to say, like I am deserving you know, like and I matter you know it's not for me being selfish is a bell sending my own personal boundaries of myself for what I can, and you know air cannot take from other people does that sound about right. yeah you can always say Nada know. i'm not that that person, you know, but I feel as though sometimes we look at communicating ourselves to other people as being are wanting our own things as being selfish but it's really just us protecting ourselves, you know."
18742.0,Patient,Exactly because that's how. that's how it makes me feel.
298.0,Provider,mm hmm.
18742.0,Patient,Time being like to self centered maybe. mm hmm really like it or if i'm taking a personal when it really isn't.
298.0,Provider,"mm hmm yeah so that's how it makes you feel yes it's okay to serve the way that you feel to you know, and to say like I feel like a little. You know bit kind of like you know selfish for communicating my needs, and you know, like him, wanting things from other people are being self centered a little bit yeah."
18742.0,Patient,"I think that's definitely like the main thing that i'm struggling with right now. It was it was mostly because. My relationships more of my romantic life on my friendships. But without even wanting it my friendship. strain me too, but it's like I do it because I want to help my friends. You know or be there, or be part of their life, but how many times we I end up. Not doing something for my life, because I am doing something with my friends."
298.0,Provider,"yeah kids you are doing something with your friends yeah. yeah. If he had a magic wand, you know how would you want your life to look like. always like X axis that question in terms of what we're talking about with you, you know, being able to set boundaries or feel worthy or anything of that nature."
18742.0,Patient,"Well, definitely a better job. I think that i'm pretty satisfied with my friends and or connections. I want to say yeah I don't like to judge people like that, so I feel appreciated for my friends."
298.0,Provider,mm hmm.
18742.0,Patient,"which I think is important. yeah um, so in that area, I want to really change much um. I have a. it's mostly on my career, I think, is mostly like my professional life when when it kind of like i'm."
298.0,Provider,Paying yeah.
18742.0,Patient,changes the whole dynamic of it. And then my romantic life I just obviously I miss. yeah.
298.0,Provider,"Okay, so your romantic life it's always been."
18742.0,Patient,"A mess yeah, so I think that it will be dislike if I could fix. Something what the magic long it'll be definitely my insecurities."
298.0,Provider,insecurities I like that.
18742.0,Patient,"Because I think that my fears have become a disability, for me to get better opportunities in life."
298.0,Provider,"To get better opportunities in life. Of year has been a factor of you, you know, like are you know, in terms of you finding better opportunities for yourself, you just feeling afraid to diesel's to step out on your own or something okay. Okay, I think we got some good goals you know, for you, you know learning to set boundaries lane to ask for what you want. And in for you to feel deserving and identify you know dream values to make you feel as though you know, like your to empower you like that finds to empower you. Okay."
18742.0,Patient,i'm a very negative person I always always always assume the worst is going to happen and I like I take for granted that the bad thing is going to happen before the positive thing happens so my mindset is negative.
298.0,Provider,mm hmm.
18742.0,Patient,"So a lot of times it'll be just like you know all this person is not looking for me, because they don't care about me because some there's an example. yeah um but I don't know they don't want to be with me because i'm stupid and I dislike I. yeah deny myself to ask or do certain things or do something, because I had already assumed that is going to be bad. So I definitely like. It hasn't got it has gotten better with the medication, but I usually like just burst into a panic attack when i'm trying to like communicate, something that is very important, or emotional, for me, so I can I I couldn't even talk like it has gotten better. But yeah. And then i'm always i'm very pessimistic and I don't know how to change that I understand now that it has that part of it was. Like literally like an imbalance like a chemical imbalance, because the. The antidepressants really made a difference on that. But still i'm too negative and I want to change that I want to be able to change that."
298.0,Provider,You want to be able to change that so to you know replace your negative thoughts with positive thoughts.
18742.0,Patient,"Yes, but I."
298.0,Provider,don't.
18742.0,Patient,believe in them.
298.0,Provider,"it's weird at all, he don't believe in them yeah."
18742.0,Patient,"I just think it's kind of stupid, for some reason."
298.0,Provider,"You think is stupid to think about the positive that can happen. yeah yeah yeah because your your mind is he used to going to kind of like the negatives, you know, but the worst case scenario, and that happens, a lot with people who do suffer from anxiety. And I believe anxiety is what we have we here get your license it disorder panic disorder, you know. arm, you know, like it's it's normal, probably for you at this point in time, in your life, just think about you know the worst case scenario, you know. yeah Have you ever lived out their worst case scenario, like that actually happened. yeah yeah that's probably why."
18742.0,Patient,million times. I really since I was a kid yeah.
298.0,Provider,"Since you're a kid yeah. So if you're used to that you know that's going to be, you know, like where our mind goes."
18742.0,Patient,"it's kind of like it's what it's familiar, you know."
298.0,Provider,"yeah what's familiar to yeah. And that's going to take some work. But you're right place. Okay you're in the right place for what done these issues. yeah. Okay, so we talked about your treatment goals you know, we want to get out there P, and you know, do you have anything that you want to talk about today."
18742.0,Patient,not specifically. Nothing like I mean I guess that situation with. With the boundaries. yeah.
298.0,Provider,yeah I guess there's nothing like specifically that has triggered me in particular right now. i'm perfectly that has tricky.
18742.0,Patient,Is everything yeah everything in general that I have to deal with this year.
298.0,Provider,mm hmm.
18742.0,Patient,I think I told you right I end up just like having lupus and all that stuff.
298.0,Provider,Okay.
18742.0,Patient,God my. Blood work done for lupus this week and it's completely inactive.
298.0,Provider,"Oh, is that a good thing."
18742.0,Patient,"yeah. Okay, almost impossible um. I don't know if you're familiar eyes for what lupus is but it's like is an autoimmune disease is pretty similar to HIV, for how it works. Your body self destruct basically and. it's always there and you have flares you have like burst, it can be triggered by anything what I had was a flare. Up nobody in my family had lupus and and I was pretty much the same person so nobody really even thought about that."
298.0,Provider,mm hmm.
18742.0,Patient,"um but I was going to like enough, I was going through an episode of stress basically and and and that triggered lupus a me, even though I didn't have that disease, like us, Mike. Is wasn't hereditary is what i'm trying to say and. they're gonna be you know you're gonna have you have to like take medications forever and all of that and. And right now i'm not taking any because they just disappear, you know it was basically just. The stress of what I was going through just caused me lupus and that has happened before I had guess tried this. When I was 16. I don't have guests try this anymore and that's like a disease that apart you it doesn't really like have a cure you just live with it, and there are certain things that you're not supposed to eat and everyday to have I never had another guest tried his episode ever ever again. same with migraines I have migraines like around my 20 1920 years old. And then I don't have migraines anymore I don't never really treated myself for my grades never really took medication for a lot."
298.0,Provider,mm hmm.
18742.0,Patient,"and And now it just happened to same with lupus so it's like every time that i'm going through like an episode of stressing life I create myself on the seas and then, when that episode passes the disease goes away, but one that has been always been there is. high blood pressure, but it's because i'm really nervous i'm super nervous."
298.0,Provider,"very nervous yeah. yeah so the high blood pressure, always stays with fail. yeah yeah."
18742.0,Patient,"I think that this year, someone might have told me that it's pretty possible, that is because of the same anxiety itself or more. yeah yeah."
298.0,Provider,"yeah because you have panic, you know and generalized anxiety and the combination of both you know can create kind of like this hyper. You know, like yeah i'm kind of like fight or flight, you know response in your body when you feel like you can never be centered or calm, you know because of you know, different things happening in your life yeah. And it seems like there's anxiety has been there since your adolescence since you're a team right."
18742.0,Patient,yeah probably a kid honestly.
298.0,Provider,head okay honestly yeah. yeah so learning effective.
18742.0,Patient,"For your for know. The first time that I pretty much just like learn. or fell how it was without not feeling, it was when I started the medication like about two months ago."

18742.0,Patient,"yeah actually. domini told me like you know you're going to have headaches you're gonna. be feeling weird because your body's going to get used to it, and I was just feeling way better I was I don't have any negative side effects from it. I can fail so we're all familiar in a good way basically."
298.0,Provider,"uh huh there. yeah So how are you coping with everything, do you have a coping mechanism, you know Dean surgery do to kind of cope with the stress the anxiety before medical condition, maybe we should talk about coping skills to."
18742.0,Patient,yeah I don't think I have one honestly.

Okay sounds like you know for right now just being able to Center yourself, because your baseline is being like this and we want to pray kind of like calm your nervous system down a little bit so let's start with you know. Deep breathing exercises has really helped, for you know a lot of people."
18742.0,Patient,workout today at noon.

298.0,Provider,"yeah so working now's a good coping skill, you know, maybe you know, like Have you ever tried yoga you know and working on your breath fork."
18742.0,Patient,"And now, yes, but, and then I. I cannot do it by myself, you know, I have to have someone that that is kind of like dare with me. By myself. I get anxious in a matter of five minutes and I can't even sit down in front of my TV to do yoga. I will have to like go to what class and. You know, like have some sort of guide for it. Because my myself i'm just to. Like no ability to focus so much like that, by myself."
298.0,Provider,yeah. yeah.
18742.0,Patient,"I wish I could find like that motivation to be to have that focus like dad you know but i'm. The medication has definitely helped me with that, like, I noticed before you know cleaning my apartment was like really difficult to do, and now you see my apartment and it's like super clean and organized like man my life ever and that's like. A month and a half from now, you know, probably ever since I can talk to you guys probably. early November late October. So that's definitely helped like there are a lot of things like Aaron said small things that were horrible for me to do before, and now I kind of like don't overthink about how horrible it is I just go and do it. But it's not everything like yoga like watch a movie I I don't think i've watched the movie in the past three months honestly."

Teach you guys my technique, you know from the mindfulness hamper can because I think you're really does help you know and it's it's easy practices that have a big reward you know if we learn to practice them yeah. yeah so how about you carve out maybe five to 10 minutes a day and it's going to be hard at first. We said and do a meditation you know it can be a guided meditation or it could be just listening to music and just doing your deep breaths you don't have to you know, like. worry about if thoughts still happen, while you're trying to meditate you know just let your dots just come to you and just accept your thoughts as Dr. You know, whatever is basically about paying attention, bringing back awareness, you know by to what you're thinking about you know, bringing everything to your awareness does that make sense. yeah yeah yeah because I think that you know, combined with fight to exercise, you know Those are two really good ones so i'm. going to challenge you, you know the next couple weeks to carve out five to 10 minutes, and you can find meditation like on YouTube for you to do, are you can download the APP called calm, you know, and they have like a five minute like meditation."

So, then, I wanted to break up with him after that fight, because I got physical and because nobody ever in my life yelled at me like he did that day. So I was just the on my body was just like on alert mode at that point, but he just wasn't leaving and he wasn't my lease and he was pretty much just living here with me and. But he was like like he was he's an Anti vax Sir. Against the Kobe vaccine and you know. republican super like pro trump. Racist verse on hundred percent. I you know I mean I was with him and I, he was be just reassuring like you know. yeah I just putting people down and he was like you're so lucky that you are an immigrant and that you are. You know Latina and you have like this and you met someone like me and he was like you know, like a white person like. it's literally like I didn't never wanted to believe. or I I respect because i'm under swelling. And I respected. The social problems of this country and I understand I respect that race is a problem here as as learned a lot of other countries, like the one I came from. And i've always thought like, why does it happen, but. Be with him made me understand why there are a white there's a problem with that. I I understood. The concept of why people you know call certain people have widely you know, like white supremacists and stuff like that I live that it firsthand."

And I. Like be with your friends, because you don't want to be a good women are family women and it's like. I want those things, but I just don't want to you know. It was horrible this year was horrible like my relationship with him was what trigger my lupus of i'm aware of that now, because I don't have it anymore. And after the CVs situation, obviously, the people in the fat in the pharmacy interfere. They were like we're going to call social services, you cannot come to this pharmacy again like you're an abuser you're being abused her right now."
298.0,Provider,mm hmm.

It was really a problem to take him out they they took them all the leasing them 72 hours probably.
298.0,Provider,mature away from him now because it does sound like verbal abuse.
18742.0,Patient,"It was all kind of it was you know it was physical it was mental it was you know spoke, and it was like everything everything I. I am a boss in my job i'm the manager of my job I manage a staff. mm hmm I you know have my friends, I. Like I told you, I am an immigrant I got to this entry political asylum. So you can imagine the type of shift that i've been through like. This and. It was the last year and a half. I was with someone that was telling me the whole time that I was worth nothing basically. You know. So you gather build, I think it was a projector because he didn't have any of those things he didn't have a job he was on add. His dad was an is an MBA MBA coach and and you know he comes from money was homeschool he didn't have any friends, because he that he grew up with friends. So he doesn't understand empathy you know, imagine just a rich white kid locked in a room just being thought by super expensive professors and stuff like that. So you know, he was an empathetic with anything. mm hmm so it was you know, in trying to put me down a lot and, like all of your friends are fake with you there they're just they're not your friends guys only want to Fuck you and the girls are fake to you know, like."
298.0,Provider,yeah.
18742.0,Patient,"And you know pretty sure you know more about this than I do, but you're with a person and you started like seeing the world as they presented to you as well, I do started like taking like baby this whole thing is true."
298.0,Provider,yeah you start to be gas lighted by someone.
18742.0,Patient,"yeah I was gaslighting. A lot like. I couldn't even take my phone to the bathroom like if I was going to take a bath to my makeup or just viewed by necessities I eat cotard. Because for him if I take my phone on the bathroom and then, but I was going to text someone you know, like some guy or anything so I wasn't allowed to get my phone."
298.0,Provider,He sounds very insecure. That he was a person who was very insecure and.
18742.0,Patient,"Oh yeah yeah I couldn't go out with my friends, I spent like we dated a year. Almost a year and a half. And I. For a year and a half, I didn't hang out with my friends lever."
298.0,Provider,"Oh wow so he took you away from your support to them, you know from people who are close to. yeah you know those type of relationships. were very. Nice, just like you said suffer from physical to mental to verbal you know, like with him, you know."
18742.0,Patient,"How situation, a girl physical because he used like this bad thing, like. He would like do this as a joke like oh Come on, you know, and he had in my face and it's like don't have read my face because one day is just not going to be by accident, not even as a joke don't do it. And one day he did it kind of hard and I had like a face mask so I was really like sticky. and It kept it felt like a slide like he's like my face, you know because of the stickiness so the cream of the lotion. So I reacted and solve the fantasy immediately and slap him hard, because he already knew this was a no, no, for me. And I hit him harder and then he obviously got mad at me because of that and hit me hard like he and everything is just like and then I run away and then yeah that was pretty much just like we were together for a week after that, but we weren't really together, you know. I call us already like telling him like I cannot be with you anymore, and I knew that the only way that he will literally be just gone. It was the vaccine and the vaccine was such an issue for him, because he wanted to have children and his perfect blog was going to be contaminated, but this vaccine, so he didn't want his children, and he has pure blood children to be contaminated with that. So this has all been like super traumatizing for me, because now it's like. I understand you know it's just like all of these things that media sometimes tell you and it's like people are overreacting you're like this people certain you know they're humans, you cannot add certain way, like this person acted exactly. Exactly what other people is criticizing about society, right now, you know. yeah I heard like you know, he would like say things to me like.
