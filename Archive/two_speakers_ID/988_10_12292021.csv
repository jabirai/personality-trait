Because I went out, I went out of town for about a week on one. daughter, with the rest of my family before thanksgiving. And so I just make sure that i'm covered. In case something happens at the pharmacy because this time of. year I know the pharmacy can be a little difficult to get things done, sometimes."
10.0,Provider,"Sure yeah no problem, but are you taking more than 150 a month. No cuz you picked it up on the. According to these records you picked it up on July. X and then August, the fourth and then September, the first and then September the 30th and then then October 28 so it's like every month you're picking it up, a few days shy of 30 days.

That you're getting better getting the pain relief that you need. i'm not trying to be punitive but. The thing is i'm going to have to submit an override to be able to prescribe you that because because we're so overdue on the urine but while i'm in here i'm going to change so there's no. Confusion that you are away, it says, right here you're on a quarterly on second. let's make sure they change this appropriately."

10.0,Provider,uh huh.
988.0,Patient,"My a one sees we're about only two points over what they should be. And so, when I started, then when I found that out, and she said, you know if you change your diet. You may be able to get rid of this issue with the diabetes Type two. So. i'm going to do that i've been changing my diet, more and more."
10.0,Provider,"Okay, are you taking meds you taking metformin."
988.0,Patient,Yes or 1000 milligrams a day.
10.0,Provider,Are you taking them attacks alone. I.

10.0,Provider,yeah it's like you're not taking the metallics alone anymore. say good last prescribing back in June i'm not sure. I wasn't prescribing it must have been your primary.
988.0,Patient,"yeah because that was one that. just wonder i've taken at night, whenever I get it. I just thought it was a waste."
10.0,Provider,Okay well let's try this this to sanity and it's it's the most effective for pain. So you could take one or two three times a day.
988.0,Patient,And instead they take one of those. right before I go to bed.
10.0,Provider,"yeah you can take that and take the gabba penton before bed, if you take a gabapentin antezana Dean, and your buprenorphine you should sleep through the night."
988.0,Patient,Okay cool that's wonderful.
10.0,Provider,"that's a heavy duty cocktail that I think it's going to be helpful for you, so I will prescribe enough to sanity and to get through the month and then. And i'll read up on your buprenorphine i'll write a an override but I need you to get that urine down you got to go to a quest lab and have it done okay."
988.0,Patient,"Okay. I gotta be checking my. grandson and for the question anyway so i'll just. Do the mobile appointment, at the same time."
10.0,Provider,"Okay perfect i'll let me submit a note here for them to. let's make sure they did that. Okay. might take them a minute to get this done so, when do you have to take your son to to quest."
988.0,Patient,I got to make an appointment with this week.
10.0,Provider,"Okay, so make sure you check with us that we've gotten the lab requests in before you go to quest. i'm going to tell them to contact you when they've done it in contact. to let them know. When. We go yeah."
988.0,Patient,and
10.0,Provider,What were you gonna say.
988.0,Patient,"um anyway, my Tokyo and listener bro I take both of them. But my my blood pressure was way too low. So my doctor changed it to 25 milligrams. mentor bolo at night. And then listen abroad, one in the."
10.0,Provider,"Okay, so you're taking, let me change that that so the matola is now 25 at night."
988.0,Patient,"Yes, sir."
10.0,Provider,"Okay, thank you any other updates on your medications."
988.0,Patient,"And I think that's about it, but you know I take any tripling right."
10.0,Provider,"yeah we talked about that. yeah are you taking bupropion. Oh yeah no that's that's all too okay. Okay metropolis 25 got it. Okay, and then i'm going to delete the. old one. Okay, so yeah again try that, but the gabba penton and you got the laville and you got to sanity and the probe deeper buprenorphine you should be good to go with."
988.0,Patient,"That i'm going to give me able to sleep, the whole night."
10.0,Provider,And I think that tumor it's a good idea to. Okay it's really.
988.0,Patient,Like after I take my grandson to school. I got my seat heater on and i'll set my car outside the.
10.0,Provider,drive.
988.0,Patient,The fish eater on any kickback and. I can get about. 45 minutes or hours worth of sleep. i'm just so worn out.
10.0,Provider,"yeah. well. I know it's difficult. Whatever you can do like the cleaning up of your diet that you were talking about for the diabetes will actually help your pain, too. yeah so. Less sugar more fruits and vegetables that's going to help with inflammation. Stress you know."
988.0,Patient,What that.
10.0,Provider,Managing your stress. For asked why I really think it'd be good for you to come to the chronic pain group man gets.

10.0,Provider,it's every Wednesday at 4pm. Okay.
988.0,Patient,You don't have to come every.
10.0,Provider,"Time, but if you if you drop in and get some support because folks you know that they know what it's like to go through this chronic pain. Correct yeah. Alright, so Wednesdays at 4pm alright. Okay, and. In the meantime i'm sending enough medicine just for one month and then we'll see how things are going and figure out Unfortunately I don't know if you've noticed this but, like once you get up above four five of these buprenorphine it's not that much more effective."
988.0,Patient,With that.
10.0,Provider,Do you agree.
988.0,Patient,yeah times I do.
10.0,Provider,"Like if you take that extra six one a day, do you actually get any benefit."
988.0,Patient,"At night, it seems to help if I let it work a little bit. i'll be able to go back to sleep within 45 minutes to an hour."
10.0,Provider,Okay.
988.0,Patient,"Like I say I go out to my car and that's the best place for me, whenever like that."
10.0,Provider,In the middle of the night.

988.0,Patient,"Oh yeah. It goes, all the way across the bed. I want to do that."
10.0,Provider,yeah there's there's a good one called a bio matt I think that one might be on the pricier side but there's probably other ones that are similar.
988.0,Patient,Because I know like I say out um. I don't want to. sleep on a heating pad all right Glenn oh that's not good. But.
10.0,Provider,i'm.
988.0,Patient,"In a hot bath tub. And, or when i'm in the living room. I put the heating dad on my I started from like my lower back and then it goes, all the way to my knees. And that helps sometimes."
