Because. It was just things that I was supposed to already know. And I didn't and I didn't know who to talk to about so. yeah. I just had to figure it out."

My my mom she's never been diagnosed but. She herself, as I got older I realize oh my mom choked me because she probably has ptsd. Not choking me. Like I didn't do anything wrong my mom just snapped. You know. I can tell like even at a very young age. Like when you're seven years old, these things are happening and you're like this can't be me, but you you you you think it is. But years and years later you're like, no, no one taught her how to love a child. And i'm that child that child and. I just give her you know I just I just tell her how it is now like that's not right and you don't do that I i'm very straightforward with my mom with a lot of boundaries because. Be being around her causes me to be very sick mentally."

She was sick and she was. pretty much addicted to painkillers so she was. Always out of it. And she would not let me walk to school, but I didn't want her to drive me because she would fall asleep, while she was driving and I was just a kid and I just realized the other day I was processing it. I should have never had to. worry about the adults my life, the way that I that I did and that's why it's so important to me for my kids to actually be a parent. Right like. My but my children's father, he passed well my boyfriend he passed away. 20."
740.0,Provider,"Thank you, sorry to hear that."
16905.0,Patient,"Well, it, it was. Please don't take this the wrong way it was coming I. knew it was coming because of the things that he was dealing with. and So. I i'm still processing.

740.0,Provider,"Okay, good."
16905.0,Patient,I mean yeah.
740.0,Provider,"So growing up outside of you taking care of. Your mom and your step mom um were there ever were there any other event that stood out to you growing up in your family, friends neighborhood anything that you i'm kind of stuck with you over the years into your adulthood."
16905.0,Patient,Can you give me an example.
740.0,Provider,"Sure, so like. Depending on so if something ever impacted you like Oh well, um i've had i've had trauma that I brought over into my adulthood i've had the kind of neighborhood I lived in with a little world if I had bad exposure. Or maybe you've had some opposite you had somebody That was really kind to you. That that you never forgot the kindness, they gave and just with you over the like just anything that kind of stood out to you growing up."
16905.0,Patient,"Okay, so I thought I have a negative and a positive experience, I had a lot of. I had. trauma as far as. Like male interactions at a very young age. So I had some some negative. Situations or whatever, that is still with me as an adult that it's very. it's hard for me to interact with the opposite sex. Because of. trauma throughout my adolescence and childhood. And then. And then, so I thought i'm going to say for that. that's one that I that I really do have to work through that because there's fathers and grandfathers out there who don't look at me in that kind of way that our Father Leo grandfatherly and. But because of my trouble I can't it's it's hard for me to interact. With people day today and that's probably part of the social anxiety as well that's. me to. Okay positive up. In my congregation. Through throughout my childhood I I did have a while I had my I had so my very my first childhood best friends bulkhead. She was always there and very supportive. of no Actually, I have a lot of positive experiences, because I was really into our audio gauge of photography and. writing so I have good experiences as far as with my talents. Because I did I was given an opportunity. i'm here for not kids. Yes. I already can bring about a drink and I was in the parking lot of a zoom meeting and yeah just came through your lobby close, so I keep saying to. You too. I like. It okay. I do have to get back to work."
740.0,Provider,Oh no no that's fine. Let me know when you got to go and then. We can just reschedule and come back to it later.
16905.0,Patient,"Okay, so around 1150 I got."
740.0,Provider,"that's fine that's fine. i'm almost done anyway i'm. In a relationship, you have two children system."
16905.0,Patient,"yeah no. No relationship it's too it's too difficult. I do not want to be in a relationship till I deal with so much drama, because I don't want to bring some of that old energy. relationship. I have tried to date, and I do have a male friend."
740.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16905.0,Patient,But I already told them up front hey i'm dealing with this this this I can't date right now. Right so.
740.0,Provider,"Okay, so um, the last thing that I have to actually before we go. and get back to work, what are some things you want to work on, while you're hanging treatment."
16905.0,Patient,"A ballad about balancing my emotions. and Coping. boundaries. yeah. If that makes sense. i'm gonna mute myself really quick, while I."
740.0,Provider,"So, when you say coping coping in regards to work. Well, with work."
16905.0,Patient,"So um I guess just with. I guess just coping with my childhood trauma, but I can use it as. I don't know experience to do what I need to do in life, because I know that these experiences don't have to be negative. I can use them. in a positive way towards wherever i'm going in life. Like I know that because there's plenty of other people who have experienced something similar, or worse, or whatever, and I just want to be able to work through it, so that i'm not so. I don't know shut away from what else is going on out in the world."
740.0,Provider,Okay.
16905.0,Patient,yeah. I just want to be able to cope with it better and not let it. bother me as much.
740.0,Provider,"So i'm going to make your treatment plan. Right i'm going to put in there, though, about the balance that emotions, the boundaries and the coping with the trauma. um. One thing I will have to say is this. Which on. When it comes to trauma right it's not like it's not like when you get sick and you get medicine and, eventually, you know after you know with the medicine, you know, eventually, a few days or a week or so it's about you know. And so you know they they most of the people they'll just they'll get sick and they say I just need medicine, so I can cope. Right, which means I just need to I just need some relief momentarily, but this is something that I would encourage you to look at it from a different perspective. Because mind you've already been coping which means you already it hasn't killed you right you ain't you ain't go nuts. You stay with to be a good mom to your children, you still able to work it's about a lifestyle, so you already been coping but emotionally so it's basically it's been very destructive to you emotionally and mentally. Right. And so, one thing I will say is that, instead of learning instead of learning to cope with it now, we gotta learn how to live. Through it, and to be able to try them over it does that make sense, because they don't go away. is like grief."
16905.0,Patient,yeah.
740.0,Provider,"It don't go away, but the more you have established yourself your identity your values understanding of what took place forgiving right, it has it's a major thing forgiven. But i'm. forgiving. from moving those resentments getting rid of hatred and and things of that nature once you're able to get past all of that, then of course it's it's as if. You were suffocating and now you're able to breathe it's kind of like something lists of offer you, to the point where now I can actually exhale in meaning. youmzain yeah."
16905.0,Patient,"And so, and i'm getting to that point. I see where some of the. Pressure or darkness is kind of like. Breaking apart."
740.0,Provider,Yes.
16905.0,Patient,"I mean, I still got a long way to go."
740.0,Provider,"Absolutely, and it takes time, but let me say some you can get there, but i'm gonna tell you the thing I want to tackle the most i'm not gonna lie to you, I know lassie I would say what I want to thank the. One thing I want to talk about the most is you, and this people pleaser I you got this so this this sw on your chair superwoman. And my thing is like this is that that's one of the things that I have to tackle this with you because of the fact that I see how detrimental, this has been to you. It has starred you, because this is the thing you know i'm saying, especially in regards to because my thing is like this. And I and this."
16905.0,Patient,This is my disclaimer.
740.0,Provider,"We got a minute, but this. might explain okay. i'm an Orthodox type therapist you know i'm really real and i'm. I know I might get fired after this, but you know i'm just saying i'm just a really real type therapist right because a lot of times, we have to understand there's some of the misery that is not eggs of us we bring it on our sales."
16905.0,Patient,100%.
740.0,Provider,Does that make sense and so. I really like this if. If I. If I can leave you with anything before I go before we gotta go it ain't nobody asks you to do them don't volunteer huh yes. Yes.
16905.0,Patient,"Yes, ma'am yes ma'am. Yes, ma'am No one. Can I just tell you one story. That made me so emotional my neighbor got evicted and I took her eight year old daughter and. wow and and then I realized I couldn't do it, she came at me sideways the mom. came up was always CPS CPS placed her with me, because I agree to it. But there was no protection against the. mom her mom, and so I said I can't do this anymore. yeah I called her mom I said I can do this with you, I called CPS I said I can't do this."
740.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16905.0,Patient,"So I stopped focusing on my children i'm a singer I have to give my children that that's the only person second my interview way deserves a segway anyway, because they didn't ask me here."
740.0,Provider,"Right. So, so let me say some."
16905.0,Patient,That was difficult.
740.0,Provider,chosen know.
16905.0,Patient,can do that.
740.0,Provider,"and see that's the thing and i'm gonna say these why i'm. Saying because it doesn't mean that you're not carrying. Now doesn't mean that you're not a nice person because see when you when you're a child, and you see mommy is suffering, of course, you want to help mommy out."
16905.0,Patient,hey I want to you want to be there from mommy because it's my yeah.
740.0,Provider,"However. And because your mom was not emotionally stable enough and senior wasn't really cognitively stable either no so. she'll see she had. She had. She didn't have enough boundary to even say no honey don't do that, I want you to be a chat. So she get the help of course you know i'm saying, because she will have no boundaries either. So now, this has spilled over into your adulthood right. yeah i'm gonna say this to you. Is there I understand working at a job you say well it's the people around me. it's. Not that i'm gonna say this."
16905.0,Patient,"And that and and I know it's it's the Okay, the job isn't so much like me not be able to work isn't so much the people around me it's the fact that that I don't know how to speak up for myself, I don't know how to you know. set boundaries. i'm afraid. of being in the workplace, because I. Know like i've. never had a job it's because of the. Right. done the trauma that i've been through just. Going and I can't separate myself from it. Right now right now."
740.0,Provider,And then. work.
16905.0,Patient,"With my anxieties. And i'm no good for the workplace and that's why i'm like okay i'm gonna choose to do what I can right now i'm financially comfortable and stable my my bills are paid i'm going to work on myself so that i'll be work, good for whatever workplace I go into. Right now, I know i'm not. i'm not right."
740.0,Provider,"And that's okay with. That. Because right now it's just The fact of the lack of refusal skills learning how to say no, and me know and not to go back on your note and change your mind and say, yes, because you feel sorry for people. yeah so because the thing about it is that we all have problems, mind you, as a therapist i'll see I see everybody stood right. There you can you imagine how crazy I would be if I take everybody problem song I got over 100 patients do, can you imagine me taking everybody issues on and I got to be a wife and I got to be a moment to my six month old. Actually, not. A match it so no."
16905.0,Patient,"No, no."
740.0,Provider,"No, what i'm saying what i'm saying is is that I."
16905.0,Patient,can't.
740.0,Provider,"do that so. i'm going to UK it's not that you can't do that, but you haven't learned the skill, yet, but i'm going to teach you. That is gonna be good okay and. it's gonna be fun and it's gonna be hard and it's going to be challenging and it's gonna suck but i'm gonna love it you're gonna hate it."
16905.0,Patient,"With door dash with door dash I can do it because I don't have to get connected. With people. know I don't but it's. it's hard not to. Be so I got I got it, I have to learn."
740.0,Provider,"And I live on it. we're gonna work on it yeah I am going to add that to your treatment plan and so we'll work on that that's something I want to tackle first. And then the rest of it, the rest of it, it just come into play. But I want to capture their first. They basically all coincide with each other so it's best sure a ripple effect because you have the trauma and as a result. Of the trauma is college or emotions to be out of whack and then, as a result of your emotions not awake now yeah yeah so I mean now we have boundary issues and so and that's. yeah we'll work on it and i'm going to keep you any more, but which. was another session with me or or do you want to do it yourself."
