9393.0,Patient,No we've never met.
298.0,Provider,Good. i'm racking my brain going I know this me but I don't know.
9393.0,Patient,"yeah I think I. May I think someone asked me to have a meeting a few to talk to me something about joining the group I haven't been a part of a group, yet that I don't know if I need to or how to or what or I don't know."
298.0,Provider,"Okay, so in our program our mental health program it is, it is a requirement to go to groups, I understand that people don't want to, but I can't change the requirement, what I can do is cut down the frequency, but I can't take it completely away. And that's the challenge you probably came in under a provider. I don't know what provider, you came in under you're probably being transferred to me because I say, is no longer with us and so. they're trying, you know just to help everybody get compliant with our program if you're not able to do group therapy I would need to discharge you and help you get to a program that's more suited for you, I don't want to have to do that, but it's up to you."
9393.0,Patient,Well i'll tell you I really have been enjoying the one on one that i've had maybe like once a month or twice a month with. Dr Jesse.
298.0,Provider,Jesse.
9393.0,Patient,yeah I love her so i'll do whatever I need to do to stay.
298.0,Provider,"So, and she runs excellent groups like she her groups are just amazing, so I would love to you know if you wouldn't mind if we could do twice a month and then, if you really feel like you talk to Jeff see it, and she says, you can go down to once a month, you can do that. So that's my thoughts how about we do that."

9393.0,Patient,"Yes, I think that would be just awesome, let me just double check my calendar really quick. I think that's. Or, I could start you know, making sure I have those tuesday's only be every every other Tuesday right."
298.0,Provider,"yeah as long as you got to in a month let's say you did, because you knew, you were going to be gone you did to back to back that would be okay, and another thing is, if you wanted more than that you would you would have access to go to more than that."
