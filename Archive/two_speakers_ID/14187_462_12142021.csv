14187.0,Patient,There we go.
462.0,Provider,"There we go I can hear you can you hear me. yeah okay good, how are you doing."
14187.0,Patient,"Okay, how are you."
462.0,Provider,doing good Thank you. yeah how's everything going over the last couple weeks.
14187.0,Patient,"i'm. Like. i'm i've been pretty stressed so it's just been like. Not useful for life. Like for my health I just i'm like stressed, all the time and busy all the time and. I don't have a lot of downtime. Sorry cats coming to hang out."
462.0,Provider,"that's okay. All right, all the stress continues."
14187.0,Patient,"The business continues yeah. yeah yesterday I had a really bad day just wasn't. feeling great about myself and just. felt like crap pretty much all day and and I miss I miss my medication, the day before that I had to get up early and lead to take some of the airport and it just kind of threw threw me off black and. I wound up missing my mad, and so, then the next day was just really bad as a result, and so that kind of just like amplified yesterday, like it just made everything a lot worse. And then I just haven't been doing great but. yeah no no and hanging in there."
462.0,Provider,"Okay yeah something we talked about last time, just to try to work through that stresses, having wind down time in the evening and trying to do, just like a little check in in the morning, some grounding and the little check in in the evening, have you been able to work on that at all."
14187.0,Patient,"Well, little bit yeah it's hard i'm incorporating it into my routine because I just once I get into patterns, I have trouble breaking patterns are changing patterns. I always have a lot of problems with that, but um i've been doing. kind of like when I when I have my morning coffee or like. When I have a moment I just did them in my notebook and i've been like trying to like take that time i'm like trying to track my habit. Like a lot of the habits, and so I just made, like a big kind of spreadsheet in my notebook and just have been like did I brush my teeth this morning today smoke today, did I eat fruit today, like everything."
462.0,Provider,yeah great.
14187.0,Patient,"So i'm trying to keep on top of it and, like kind of see what my patterns are. And so I try to use that time to like one down a little bit or like give myself some time, but again it's like really difficult breaking patterns and whatnot because just being busy all the time i'm like. I have to think like what my priorities are and if it's like, if I have time to wind down, then I will, but then, like, I have no time than I usually prioritize whatever it is like homework or words that like needs to come first."
462.0,Provider,"You know the kind of habit tracking is a really good tool. it's a good way to put together some patterns rights and some larger patterns, what would you say just in your thought, as far as your eating disorder patterns go like what connections can you make they're currently."
14187.0,Patient,"i'm. Honestly, I don't I don't know what connection. there's no like for me at least i'm like I don't see clearly obvious connections, but then there's like, but this stuff is probably connected like i'm I always go to bed really late that probably has something to do with it somehow or like. If. I don't know if i'm up. late and i'm. Like. No, no."
462.0,Provider,yeah no I mean one thing that's pretty much common across the board is just like bad days equals behaviors right.
14187.0,Patient,Like for most.
462.0,Provider,"People bad days eagles behaviors whether it's eating disorder behaviors or whatever behaviors. So one thing for you just starting in the eating disorder treatment is just to really think about stabilizing behaviors starting to reduce them like what you can do to prevent them what you can do to instead of doing them right other coping skills, other ways to cope and. kind of process through difficult days so when you hear about what, what do you think what Plan could you start making for yourself to just stabilize these behaviors start to replace them and start to notice them before they come."
14187.0,Patient,"I mean. I guess finding distractions from. My habit mix, but not not like distractions that other thing to do, I like to keep myself busy. which I think contributes to being stressed, all the time, but I like. More than that, I don't I don't like not doing anything I don't like just like sitting down on my own and watching a movie and that's it like I will never do that i'll always like if i'm watching something on my own i'm always simultaneously sending emails or. i'm cleaning the dishes or it was wine downtime i'm like maybe drawing at the like, but I think. It was things that I do to keep myself busy on us. And like. entertained. Maybe. But then another part of that is that I. Always wind up eating, too, is that, like aren't there like snack food because when i'm doing other things, and then I want to eat. I don't i'm not usually in the mood to like go make pasta, or like go make something i'm always like these are like oh i'm do something i'll just grab whatever is nearby. So i'm like trying part of with my habit tracker i'm trying to be more conscious of I don't eat like a lot of fruits and vegetables and, unlike. I was aware of it before, but now i'm like Oh, I like eat through like once a week that's not good. So i'm trying to like find a way for myself to. pay more attention, I guess. But it's hard because it's just like a. Like a craving because I. I don't know."
462.0,Provider,"yeah well, one thing that stuck out to me so keeping busy is really good it's important, it is a way to cope, but then there's also kind of a fine line between. Keeping busy and avoiding being present and being in one place, at one time and a lot of times binge eaters do struggle with that. And binge eating is a way to have to not be present in the moment because you kind of lose yourself in food right so. Do you feel like you avoid. being present or being in one place, at one time, if you will."
14187.0,Patient,"yeah absolutely when i'm stressed, all the time and. i've been i've known as I think I really just don't want to invent it but i'm sorry if you can hear my cat meowing she just. struggling. When she wants attention but. I find that like I since i've been so I think so stressed and like I had like a really bad panic attack last night, like it was. And it's just been like over the like this is over the past like. Six months it's been like getting more and more. And I find that like i'll i've been smoking like we'd like way more. than I ever used to I used to like occasionally smoke, maybe every couple days, just when I wanted to relax but now it's like every night because i'm so stressed out and i'm always like I always feel like I can't go to bed because i'm hello, because i'm so like on edge and like like. So i'll like go outside and smoke and then like calm down. Which i'm not. Like i'm not like. Mad at myself about it, I like it i'm fine with it, but it's just I think it might be. Not the healthiest healthiest coping thing. But then also. I just like. I feel like if I don't a lot of the time, like i'll get home from work or from class and i'm like. So, like. drained. I like feel like i'm like I can't go to bed I can't fall asleep i'm not tired i'm like physically tired, but like if I tried to go to sleep it just wouldn't happen. And I find like when I do go to sleep it's like if I smoke before bed, I can knock out and like get a nice good night's sleep. But recently if I don't i'm like up all night I like i'm getting up to go to the bathroom multiple times like I can't fall asleep. Excuse me um. But I think like I think smoking ban increases like my need to want to eat as well. which I really don't like admitting, but I think it's true. And I think I just use. like eating as like a. thing to keep busy. into like. I think it's like a. Like I have control of it, like in the way that like I can choose what I want to eat and. Like the rest of my life is. fucking sorry sorry I didn't mean to swear but."
462.0,Provider,that's fine.
14187.0,Patient,"it's just like a big. pain in the ass so it's just like I have that little bit of control. When I want to eat and like I can choose. And then I go into the cycle like it makes me feel so crappy about myself so. I just like every time every time I eat and then I finished i'm like oh I shouldn't have done that i'm a piece of shit Why did I do that and I. feel worse, but it i'm like trying to like feel. Like it's um I don't even know if i'm hungry or not, either it's just I don't know."
462.0,Provider,"yeah no i'm that's you know it is just very common to feel that way and have the shame afterwards so. You know just kind of again bringing it back to how to control the eating disorder behaviors and what you can do instead how you can. rearrange your day to day life that you have some time to be present, you can start to let yourself be present and feel more connected and grounded and in your own body, rather than you know kind of torn into a million different ways, a million different places at once."
14187.0,Patient,"yeah it's hard. Because like i've just like all my friends i'm not i'm like distancing myself from like a lot of people unintentionally and intentionally and I don't have a lot of people I rely on right now, or it feel comfortable relying on. And then, like my boyfriend and I i've got like issues with a lot of the things he's been doing, recently, just like habit and just like being away from my home and with my parents. Like i'm i'm staying at my boyfriend's apartment right now he's out of town looking after cats but. But. I think, and then on top of that, like classes i'm like trying so hard to get good grades and not flunk out and I already had to drop a ton of glasses, because I was failing and I couldn't. And I felt first of all, really shameful because I didn't I didn't tell my parents. Because I knew they'd be disappointed. But I didn't want. The bad grades stay on my records that figure to just drop it and they're not where I would only keep only kept two classes, because that's. All I can handle and. I just like. I look at other people and they're like doing so much more than I am like they're taking five classes and they have a part time job where they work. At like all week and then they also have a social life, and then they all those, and I look at all these people that like people, I know that are doing so much more than I am and i'm like Why am I so like stressed and so. Like I can't get on top of anything I feel i'm like so behind in every aspect of my life. And, just like. i'm just stressed, all the time and I don't. know how to help that so I look for areas of control and like when i'm on my own. I think i'm in my relationships just with people in general, I think. i'm very i'm. Not not in control and. Like when a friend that i'm in a out with that's been my friend, since we were kids but recently it's just like every single thing I say is wrong everything I say she wants to argue with everything I do is wrong i'm never write it and she constantly like. it's definitely not a conscious choice and she has, I think. Some anger issues that still stem from like her family relationships. But. it's like in like that's just like one example of like I don't feel like I mean, like any control in that relationship, and this is one of my dear friends, but it just makes me feel like shit and so i'm trying to. distance myself a little bit and and we we have class together and like we study a lot together so that's why it's like i'm with her so much. But. That is one example of like I. Like I finished hanging out with her, and I feel exhausted, and like miserable. Not in the way that like I don't Like her, I love her and I always have fun, but it's just like I i'm constantly like choice wants to argue and then I always just try to like push it aside and be like no like let's not discuss this. and yeah my my boyfriend. He is the most stubborn man, aside from his father who he gets it. and it's just it's. it's his way or the highway when it comes to like little things like laundry or like. Where to put certain things so when to do something and it's like. Like for the water pitcher that we have in the fridge it's like he always keeps it all the way full so that it's super heavy. And I don't like to do that, like i'll fill up my water and then, once it starts getting low i'll refill the picture. But he gets absolutely serious not curious so like he gets really upset when he's like fire stop leaving the thing half empty i'm like well. I don't want to fill it up all the way every single time that I go to get a glass of water like I don't think I have to do that every single time I want to drink water. And like. there's a lot of things that like he does that are kind of hypocritical like he hates little things like that, but then he. Whenever I have things that i'm like hey please stop leaving your dirty tissues on the floor I don't like it it's gross he just like makes no effort to change or meet in the middle i'm like I will start filling it up fill up the water, all the way, but like, can you please stop like. Leaving tissues everywhere and it's just like he doesn't. Understand like i'm trying to compromise and i'm willing to change. But, so I I feel like in that way, I want. Control with i'm not i'm not trying and like consciously to control what he's doing but it's more just like. I don't want dirty tissues in my way I."
462.0,Provider,don't want him that's that's fair thoughts it doesn't sound like you're trying to overly control him but you're just more trying to find a compromise between some of his needs and some of your needs which can be really challenging if someone doesn't want to compromise on that.
14187.0,Patient,"yeah and so it's just like that's just like again one instance out of like 100 were just like I feel like i'm like I don't like this he's like well I can't change that and i'm like Okay, can we meet halfway and then it just doesn't happen ever because he's busy, and just doesn't. Like he's out of town right now and then like he gets back and then he's busy work, I mean it's just like. A pain in the ass and. there's just like a lot of things that. link with my parents to I felt I lack control lot because I don't have any money because I work one day a week my part time job two days a week, if. I don't make a ton of money because I don't have time to go to a job and make money and. i'm in school and also like I have a lot of anxiety and last time I had like a very public service job I get like really bad anxiety attacks on the job, it was a nightmare. And that was used to go but there's just like a lot of things that I think I struggle with. And so I just don't have any money and then my parents gives me money and they give me like a like 100 a month or something, because they know that like I don't have any money and like I need stuff for like school I need to be able to afford 70 money for my car to get gas. I never have enough money for gas, I always fill the tank halfway because I can't afford to like. spend a lot money at once that I need to like groceries and whatever. So it's just like. I just I i'm always stressed, I don't have control over anything and then. I don't have any time for myself to do the things that I love like I love meeting our I love crafting and like building things and like I was like. yeah. I don't know. hiking I never exercised I just don't have time like one of the habit tractors is like have you exercise and all of them are no because. I just never have time, if I have the time I don't have the energy at all if I have time to go and exercise i'm usually like exhausted and don't have any desire to like get up and go do something."
462.0,Provider,Have you ever been evaluated or assessed or on medication for add.
14187.0,Patient,"yeah. I was on it for like two years I didn't have an official assessment like I didn't go to a like clinic and they tested, but I got prescribed adderall and then I was on by them for a little bit um. um. Because I was. I needed it for Class I like had like a lot of art assignments, or if I use it for like five hours and work on like one piece, and so I use it for that, but then I just started like maybe really general dairy. So I stopped plus like I think it was like I was going on summer break, or something and like I didn't need it. And I just didn't like that it made me feel jittery like dogs but. I remember an officially access but yeah I did I did I was on our own little bit."
462.0,Provider,"yeah just hearing, so the things you're saying about always feeling behind. You know I just thought, maybe medication could help with that, but. You don't like it, you know. that's Okay, too."
14187.0,Patient,"I mean i'd be willing to try it again been like a few years since i've been on it, but. yeah I just it just. That it was, but it was like I was. At the time, like doing a lot of like really focused art, where I needed to really focus and I get distracted really easily so."
462.0,Provider,"It could be worth making an appointment wish Intel. yeah and trying it again, but on top of that, so so that can be something on your list, but on top of that to you know it's also important to just think of what other things you can do in your day to day life to help start feeling, you know it's a lot going on. To start feeling like you're more in control of the things that you can be in control of and just coping and working through the behaviors."
14187.0,Patient,"yeah I think. it's hard like in a lot of the relationships that I have with like friends and stuff, I feel, maybe like not. I don't know in the happiest place in my relationships with friends, and so I think i'm trying to take control by like distancing myself and so that i'm doing that and pushing. And i'm not trying to push people away out of my life I just am trying to like make base and some room to look after myself and like not. Be around people all the time which I also struggle with because I don't like being like on my own alone I don't like. For a long time, like once in a while yeah like maybe like a day or two, but I just I really struggled being alone. And not like around other people, not necessarily like hanging out with people, but just being in the same vicinity and like around other people. So i'm trying to like. find a balance, where I can still drag myself with people that I love and want being with but not feel so crushed by like all the relationships that I have. I always feel like i'm doing something wrong. You just like not a good friend. So and that's hard trying to balance what."
462.0,Provider,"It is hard to feel like you're always behind like you're doing things wrong you're not a not a good friend, but yet you're constantly trying to work and do everything and feeling like you're always putting your energy out."
14187.0,Patient,"yeah like I feel like i'm. i'm I feel like i'm always like. Trying to make sure, my friends, know that I still appreciate them and love them, but then when i'm doing that i'm just falling behind and, like my work and my work work for the next 20 years and I go to do school work and other work and then. When i'm doing that I just like started accidentally just distancing myself from people, and then I feel like a crappy friend or whatever so. it's i'm just struggling so much. To find balance in my life, I feel like i'm really unbalanced. I feel like I want to do a million things that I don't have time for like a fraction of them. And then i'm constantly seeking like places that I can find some sort of control or like calm in my life, which I think is why I smoke a lot, because I, they really helped me calm down, and I can not feel so just absolutely stressed out all the time."
462.0,Provider,"yeah. And that can be it can be an okay thing to use sometimes right but relying on it completely that's where it turns into a problem so other coping skills are important to have. and incorporate into your. daily life, I know you feel so busy, but is it possible to just commit to doing, like some of your artwork. Every day that not something that's meant to be sold or anything but just just to give back to yourself."
14187.0,Patient,"yeah I, and I do want to do that, I want to start reading more. I used to read all the time, and I was a little kid but now it's like I don't remember last time I finished a book and he used to be like my favorite thing to do and. Try i'm like I really want to get back to it but. I just. And you know I haven't done it but it's on my habit with practicing so. yeah."
462.0,Provider,"So just looking at your treatment plans and looking at the goals on their. Last time we talked about the wind down time in the morning and evening check in so you've been you've accomplished that really because you've been doing your habit tracker and that's a really good start, so we can kind of check those off as accomplish today. What do you think are some new goals that you could add that would help with just everything we've been talking about."
14187.0,Patient,"I really yeah I really need to I think find. little time by me look just for myself. Where i'm not worried about. getting an email out or finishing homework, or where I I really just long for a time where I don't feel like something hasn't been done, that I need to do it goes always something I need to do, and I know it'll always be like that there's always going to be stuff to do but. I like it, I feel like even when i'm trying to calm down I struggle with like. Taking that part of my mind and putting it as my little."
462.0,Provider,letting yourself actually have that time without shame.
14187.0,Patient,"And that's why i'm like always like multitasking I feel like i'm always like balancing a million things because. i'm like if I don't then nothing's going to get done, and so I think. I think a lot of the time when i'm like trying to wind down I do like a lot of things that one that are enjoyable things. But I do them all at once, because i'm like well i'm not gonna have time to do each individually on its own. And it's not always a problem, like it's like you know run like they doodling when i'm watching YouTube like that is not like really a stressful thing that's like a fine thing, but like sometimes i'll be. Like. I like it i'll just like start combining a lot of like work things with like watching YouTube at the same time, because i'm I know I may not have time to later so like and like it doesn't. It doesn't specifically effect, like the email and sending or like the work i'm doing, but I think. In my head i'm like struggling to. isolate specific things and like calm down and not feel this intense pressure, all the time."
462.0,Provider,"yeah I think. that's yeah right there, I think you hit the nail on the head by just kind of focusing on that trying to not feel the intense pressure, all the time and will even use that quote directly. and giving yourself time for yourself, where you really try to notice that shame. That comes up like you said Oh well, there's all these other things I can be doing well yeah and life there's just always going to be endless. Things but you still have to give time back to yourself so working on that. And then, trying to be in one place, at one time trying to do one task at one time, so if it's work you're doing work or if it's YouTube you're doing YouTube you know."
14187.0,Patient,"yeah it's fine. I think I do want to focus on that, but, and I want to try to maybe start doing things that are more catered to like. helping me wind down like reading I do. I have a book i've just started clock clockwork orange because I never read it, and I was wanted to just fit on my bookshelf for ages. So I have it with me and I started reading it i'm like maybe like 10 pages in but. I really want to like try. Giving myself like just even like 1015 minutes, even if it's like really little I just. I think if i'm doing that and my. that's like when i'm doing stuff like that that's when like the binge eating and stuff occurs it's like it's a simultaneous things at the same time, and I think it's because one I have trouble like staying still and like routing is you know you know moving. And I feel like I get like jittery and I get like need to be doing something I think I have a constant feeling of needing to be moving and doing something. And when I feel uncomfortable mm hmm."
462.0,Provider,"Sure, so trying to recognize that and self sooth through either like some deep breathing getting a fidget toy a stress ball to squeeze. And just sitting through it starting to kind of ride the wave like Okay, this is uncomfortable that i'm just letting myself read right now so i'm going to squeeze a stress ball in my other hand, and just sit through this rather than going to binge eating."
14187.0,Patient,"Okay, like can try to do that. yeah those are like the main. thing. Getting some sort of stretch thing like help."
462.0,Provider,"yeah maybe getting stuff to keep your hand busy I mean that way at least you're just coping with the discomfort that's coming up for just sitting and letting yourself do something nice for yourself like reading. yeah and start trying to do that and notice if it lessens the binge behavior and also just again kind of riding The wave out of like breathing through it Okay, this is happening, but i'm going to just like really get into the story into the book and try to bring your mind there."
14187.0,Patient,"Okay yeah i'm gonna try to do that, thank you."
462.0,Provider,Those are some thoughts have you been able to find a dietitian.
14187.0,Patient,"I call it the other day, but they didn't I was on hold for like a half hour and then it hung up and then I called back later, but same thing happen, but I don't know if it was just the day that I called but it didn't get any response i'm going to try to call again this week I see."
462.0,Provider,"do that again this week. it's it's really important as part of the program but if. you're saying. it's happening yeah no it's not your fault, you did try them try calling. The virtual clinic and tell them that you need to speak to the eating disorder department and just tell them what's happening and see if they can assist you in other ways to find a dietitian in that case okay."
14187.0,Patient,"Thank you yeah i'm gonna try again and then, if not, I will. not do that. yeah."
462.0,Provider,"yeah Okay, so how about anything else that's come up for you over the past couple weeks, I know, last time you mentioned a lot of guilt around and your boyfriend. Financially buying things for you and you were going to kind of think about just trying to release that, as well as maybe looking at the different five love languages have you had any more thought about those things."
14187.0,Patient,"um I forgot about the love languages, when I do still want to do that, though, but I. I have been trying to like let it go a little more like when it comes to like coffees and. he'll get like pig out. I am just trying to appreciate it and not overthink it again it's still really hard but. I just worry I don't ever want him to think that i'm not grateful and i'm just very much taking it for granted, but I. am trying to have faith that he doesn't I know he doesn't think like that, but. it's telling myself that i'm trying to do and. yeah. i've been able to do it a little more. I think. yeah I just. With with like food and stuff I had a really bad. This separate note, I had a bad in society attack not too bad, but it was great. My boyfriend and I went out to dislike little antique mall though he loved going to with his dad he gets he likes coverings and he always brings this. And he kept asking me he's like look at the Rings like, if you want anything which look at them spoken them many kept saying it and I kept saying like no no i'm okay i'm okay I don't want anything I really don't. Because it was like you know they're all like a couple hundred dollars and it's not like that it's just like a little food thing it's like. They."
462.0,Provider,purchased for just a.
14187.0,Patient,"little piece of jewelry. And I think, by the end like I he was with his dad his dad was with us as well, so they wind up just like chatting and whatever, but I wake walked away for a little just so I I didn't want him to. Like find me and like be like a would like see like look around and see there's something you like cuz. I don't. Like that just makes me really feel guilty. And so, by the time we left, I was really anxious and then we got back, I was like having an anxiety attack and I couldn't. I didn't know how to tell him that the fact that he kept asking me and I like was so there was so much stuff and I was like in the mall and I was so overwhelmed and. And I like couldn't. Even like I was like I don't want. Anything I can't handle a gift like this, like just for for no reason there's no birthday there's no holidays, and I know he's just being kind and whatever but it's really, really hard for me to just like not care, I guess there's not not not care, but not right yeah and I know."
462.0,Provider,"you're working on it, but it's still hard, and that was a. specific example of a time where it got so overwhelming, to the point that it brought you into a bit of an anxiety attack."
14187.0,Patient,yeah. So i'm trying.
462.0,Provider,i'm.
14187.0,Patient,"trying with like the smartest thing. To not let it bother me as much, and I think that's been like doing not too bad like he'll get dinner and stuff, and I say thank you and I are I offered to contribute to it but normally decline and I always try to offer anyway. But it was just like that was like a really expensive thing that and I was already just a little overwhelmed with like the whole place. So I just struggled with that, and then I couldn't fly no like courage to tell him why, because I know he would just feel like why i'm doing this because I want to and i'm like Okay, but. I don't want that."
462.0,Provider,"yeah so it's it's a work in progress and it sounds like, especially in an already overwhelming situation and kind of triggered you."
14187.0,Patient,"yeah. um. I appreciate gifts and stuff is like I don't not appreciate that but it's just like being asked, over and over like pick something there's all this stuff and I I don't want. I. don't know I don't like gift he always tries to use his money. And again, I think that's kind of his love language, but then like I told them I said, like for like the holidays, this year, I told him I was like I specifically want from him something handmade with like. Like a card was like construction paper and markers I want him to go all out on it. that's what I want and he's like not I don't want if he's not an artist, but he's not like that's not as thing. And so I told him I was like that'll really mean something to me, I know that's not normally what you would do. Rather than just like he has all this expendable money, and you can buy whatever so he just gives it to me he knows like it's Nice and i'd like it and he'd like it like it's like I feel like. I like things that are more personalized or more there's emotion there and there's like you thought about it, you really considered it. Not just like Oh, I can afford you a new I can afford to buy you a new laptop so i'm going to get you one because you need a new one, because that's like well yeah but. What what what part, did you play there you just supplied the funds I feel like there wasn't easy you could buy me a new car, but I wouldn't. Like. What that like i'd much rather have like a date a Park, or like. An like a you know, a gingerbread house decorating night they clean or things that you think about a lot and you're."
462.0,Provider,"going to do when it goes down to the love languages so that might be something for the two for you to investigate and then for the two of you to investigate together but it's good that you're voicing. Your needs there and kind of saying, like the gingerbread house it's a great idea something where you're just kind of spending quality time together and it's fun and."
14187.0,Patient,"yeah but I it's hard just because he. gets so frustrated so easily over very little thing. That he's not an artist he can't really draw but like. Like anytime or during a game, or something where you have to draw he gets so angry and frustrated i'm like you don't have to be good, like the point is not to be good to have fun. there's like I always worry i'm like i'd love to do gingerbread decorating, but I feel like you just get frustrated could be like I don't know what i'm doing by and then he. didn't try to make the effort to learn, which is pain. Some always afraid of like kissing your mom over like little trivial things that don't matter."
462.0,Provider,"yeah so that could be good work to just find a middle ground there you can each compromise on your different love languages and see what that would look like, so we can kind of keep that as a continuing goal there. and keep you can keep working on kind of just trying to accept things it sounds like you made some progress with that, but still still working on it and what would you describe as your other treatment goals for this next time around."
14187.0,Patient,"Just like in general treatment for like for let's just probably. I want to be able to keep working on getting good sleep I sleep a lot but i'm constantly tired. So maybe going to bed earlier, I just go to bed late all the time. Because i'm trying to force time to have for myself to decompress so I like force that time that then that pushes back my bedtime all the time. To maybe finding a balance of. starting to be able to wind down earlier and that way, I could go to bed earlier. one. yeah maybe something like that, like able to. relax. And then also get a good amount of sleep and not have to exchange one for the other. yeah."
462.0,Provider,right that sounds like a good goal anything else you wanted to add to your list of goals.
14187.0,Patient,"No, I think that's good. Please."
462.0,Provider,"yeah good and you've done really well just starting to do that kind of tracking and we can see what comes out of that what bigger patterns, you have. So how about we schedule you. Are you available next Tuesday."
14187.0,Patient,I mean yeah.
462.0,Provider,And we could do noon again.
14187.0,Patient,yeah that works okay.
462.0,Provider,"Alright, so i'll put you in for next Tuesday at noon and then just try to work on that dietitian and if you keep getting the door slammed you can call us and see if anyone can help guide you there."
14187.0,Patient,"Okay, thank you, I appreciate that."
462.0,Provider,"All right. Is there anything else, I can support you with today any other questions anything else you wanted to process."
14187.0,Patient,"um no, I think I think that's it that was off my chest, which was nice."
462.0,Provider,yeah you're doing a good job you followed up on a lot of the stuff we talked about it's hard to. make such big changes and maybe you do also consider the add meds again just because it sounds like you're feeling super overwhelmed maybe to a point where medication could be helpful so something else to think about.
14187.0,Patient,yeah I definitely think. I might bring up some pounds.
462.0,Provider,"yeah all right. Well, good, then I will see you next week and you take care until then."
14187.0,Patient,"Thank you appreciate it take care, thank you."
462.0,Provider,"All right, can you please note in her treatment plan section, the goals that she just established, and if you could. Note that she completed the wind down time on December 14 completed the morning and evening check ins on December 14 completed accepting things boyfriend without having to get back on December 14 and if you could even put a direct quote about. Her thoughts on that say that she wants to continue looking into the five love languages and is still attempting to find a dietitian you can even quote, that she called and was hung up on Thank you."
