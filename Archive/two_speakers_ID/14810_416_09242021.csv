14810.0,Patient,know this month or son.
416.0,Provider,What are your what are some of your ideas about therapy like what. What do you think this might be like.
14810.0,Patient,"i'm not sure, to be honest."
416.0,Provider,You have any worries about it.
14810.0,Patient,i'm not really.
416.0,Provider,give any hopes.
14810.0,Patient,"No, not really."
416.0,Provider,"No you're just kind of here to see what happens. Okay. So hold on for one second i'm not gonna be able to see you for a second, I want to see what group you're assigned to. And then maybe we can talk a little bit about how we want to proceed. My computer's slow. group assignment Oh, here it is. Okay, so you're in the depression group. Which is great, have you gotten to it yet."
14810.0,Patient,i've gone to one.
416.0,Provider,"Okay, so you're scheduled to go to that every week. Is that going to work for you."
14810.0,Patient,"on Mondays it depends, sometimes I work, sometimes I don't."
416.0,Provider,"Okay, try to make sure if you have any control at all try to make sure you get that day, or at least that one hour off. I mean it's really important. The group. The group work for depression is super critical. So you know we were here because we want to help you feel better and medication is one way to help with that. and almost always necessary with depression. But the therapy is critical to help the medication work, the best it can we need the therapy to so the group and the individual and will get scheduled for individual therapy also. So the way individual therapy works hey Suze is that we usually decide on some goals right. So a simple goal with someone who is experiencing a lot of depression is to just start to get your mood up a little bit, we can do that sometimes by just giving you some options to do things that feel good sometimes that's a quick fix right it's not a permanent fix that we can just. Just finding things you enjoy and focusing on those things. And is really is really helpful to begin with, so we might set some sort of short term goals, like some mood boosting activities and then our long term goal, of course, is to have you not be depressed. And to have you feel like you're more able to cope with things as they come so so we'll work on those together. You and I will and i'm sure you're going to be working on that in group as well. How does that sound."
14810.0,Patient,So doable.
416.0,Provider,"A lot. A lot of the work, though, is going to be we'll talk about different skills and different things in our sessions and in your group, but you have to be practicing them on the days in between group and individual. Otherwise they don't work. So it's going to take some work from you. Now um. So you and I are scheduled to see each other about every two weeks. And how far I had to you know your group, I mean your your work schedule."
14810.0,Patient,The Saturday before so every Saturday was almost that was for the week.
416.0,Provider,Are there certain days are times that you usually have off.
14810.0,Patient,A know varies I definitely work on Wednesdays and Saturdays and. that's like. The one given day the one given day that I do work.
416.0,Provider,"So avoid those days, and what about like do you do typically start working the morning like early or. And then, are you so usually if you work do you usually work in the morning, or the afternoon."
14810.0,Patient,And morning through afternoon I got off like at 330.
416.0,Provider,"Okay, so if we were to schedule something like after 330 would we be pretty safe."
14810.0,Patient,yeah definitely.
416.0,Provider,"Perfect so let's do that. Because I have appointment, sometimes at four or five. So that might work best. Alright, so let's get you scheduled. So our next appointment can be. me get my calendar to come up. How about. Tuesday October 12 can be our next session that's about two weeks away, and we could do that at four o'clock if you want. Okay. So as soon as. We could do 1012 4pm and then we could also do the 26. Which is two weeks later, also at 4pm."
14810.0,Patient,or.
416.0,Provider,"How does that sound. OK, so the 12th and the. Alright, he says what questions do you have for me."
14810.0,Patient,A ball is mostly based on my proficiency and they run out already. Like what I can do to.
416.0,Provider,Your out of your prescription. Okay.
14810.0,Patient,and on Monday.
416.0,Provider,"So you need to go to group on Monday. this coming Monday, but in the meantime, let me send a message to share in. Our actually you know what you need to do is go to the. Go to the virtual clinic let them know go back to the virtual clinic and let them know that you're out of your prescription and you need a bridge. until Monday. All right. All right, any other questions."
14810.0,Patient,"Well, no that's."
416.0,Provider,"Okay. All right, hey serious but it's nice to meet you and I will see you so make sure you go to group. On Monday, but also make sure you go back to the virtual clinic to get your meds. And i'll see you next time on the 12th. for individual session. All right, wait wait wait before you go with so I know that you've been suicidal or how are you feeling since then, are you still feeling like you."
14810.0,Patient,"Have i've heard of the thoughts like. Every now and then i'm. Just like in the moment kind of things like I see something things like Oh, I could feel myself with this stuff like that."
416.0,Provider,Do you have any plans.
14810.0,Patient,plans now vicious I see something like I feel a certain type of way and. It just like I see something that I could be considered. Okay.
416.0,Provider,So then. You have do you have the suicide hotline number.
14810.0,Patient,"Yes, I do."
416.0,Provider,"Okay, and will you use it if you start to feel worse. and So my assignment for you in the next week or two. So I want you to close your eyes for a few minutes, every day, and I want you to imagine. What it would be like to not feel so down and like I had you do earlier like imagine your life if you are to have a house and. You know, feel great and a job and not feel sad all the time right. I want you to actually imagine that and and and I want you to feel hopeful if you can, if you can grab Ahold of a little piece of hope that you'll get there because we'll start working on some steps okay. You think you can do that. Okay. All right. And I will see you soon bye. All right, hey Zeus let's say so. Suicide risk is high. he's made two attempts I don't know if they were serious attempts that they both landed him in the hospital he did reach out for help, and both attempts and he knows how to and says he's willing to reach out now. How his depression is pretty severe. and his skills and functioning are pretty low so in terms of goals, I think, a very initial goal will be just to help him find hope and some just kind of mood boosting activities some things that he enjoys and. And to get him stabilized on meds which obviously I can't control, but those are some kind of initial goals and then. To add to the longer term therapeutic goals would be definitely helping him become more conversant with his emotional responses, be able to identify them. And to gain some skills and address them and. To be able to also expand his social circle for additional support. And finally, I think the longer term goal would be to address the the. The long term impact of his mother, leaving and her abandonment. Okay that's it."
