9218.0,Patient,"pretty good today, actually, I will say six o'clock this morning. It wasn't too bad though it's been around like 930 last night. I started I started taking the rumor on less holy when I feel like I can't really go to sleep. You know so. Because I ended up getting some I ended up gaining some weight, so I started spacing it off a little bit more, rather than just you know, instead of health habits help me go to sleep, you know, like once every couple of days right, you know. I guess it's been harder to explain."
324.0,Provider,On life that you don't take it. yeah are you able to sleep. You are. Terrible this like sleep through the. night.
9218.0,Patient,"Or the night. I mean like I did wake me up this morning around like 150 so. There was. I was, I was still kind of tired of like do. Does not especially at 150 in the morning. will blow your. Little trying to get in my window like dude just. Still. nocturnal."
324.0,Provider,out.
9218.0,Patient,"that's funny. lost them, you might have wandered off."
324.0,Provider,yeah and the thing is to be that friendly.
9218.0,Patient,um yeah.
324.0,Provider,"i've never had to just walk up and literally start, like me, he literally started like rubbing against the leg, and he fell over on the food his daughter women on his back and i'm like oh. You you belong to somebody. you're not that friendly and didn't come from somewhere. So I haven't had a chance, but i'm going to post, the one thing is I don't as much as I would love to keep. Oh, he was telling me I don't want to keep somebody else's kid looking for. me this is my second day. with him. Over kitten the other kid now. I don't think he was lost, he was in such bad shape. But they become friends, and now they play the on the on the foursome somewhere, but. You know so it's been nice if I could even find the hall for the two of them together because they've kind of bonded and."
9218.0,Patient,You don't want to separate it.
324.0,Provider,"You know, he moved in two days i'm like oh it'd be nice if you had a buddy you know, and I would love. I would love to but."
9218.0,Patient,At the same time.
324.0,Provider,"yeah. You know, and every time he come near me and he's. You know he's just coming on my lap and just. You know and i'm like someone put him. out and I don't even understand was hard to understand people to really think that. that's why i'm geared towards him being more lost because I can't see you can't be in that. affectionate towards strangers. Right and you just putting out."
9218.0,Patient,"A friend of mine, she loves her kids out almost pretty much all the time. Her cat and more she had a whole litter of kittens but some of them going off to other people. And the only kept one they called him tigger. And as a he falls are everywhere, but he's gotten he's on us as a people so whenever. walks up and she's used to people so she'll rub up on your leg and everything so. he'll do the exact same thing. And he'll just sit there and then you pet him but he's a bit scared, as you can tell me a little so but he's used to people at, from my perspective. makes you wonder."
324.0,Provider,yeah. hey and then i'm gonna buy real good patrols are going to make some fires.
9218.0,Patient,There you go.
324.0,Provider,"Put around here because he can he can definitely came from somewhere in this area and it's like they always land here. Like what is it, they always. Plant right here. It was, I know it's like they it's like they just know because he was he was in the driveway but I had to leave. And I was on a couple hours, and I said well if you still there, maybe he went back home or something I said, if he's still there, then. You know."
9218.0,Patient,go from there.
324.0,Provider,"I came back, he will feel. Like oh Oh, you will go. And I mean he's out there and then he said I thought I left them out there, like, no, no, no, and he's literally standing up there, looking at the door just almost sound like a baby crying up here like. here. You know, might he might be here the dog might COM or something and. say you know okay. I did go to a couple of the. couple of the neighbors and there's another neighbor like on another three or no yes careful with me. My suppliers. Until then i'll be calling him Leo so Nemo and Leo so I said until then we'll bring in. So that nothing happens to you and then hope that I don't get attached to you in the process."
9218.0,Patient,You kind of hard.
324.0,Provider,"Which is hard because. I mean. it's like i'm literally attached it day one. You know, and I go back to i'm about to talk about it, I will look to foster, which is what i'm feel like i'm doing now, but I wouldn't be good at it, because. I don't want to give him up. Right and. So now i'm thinking, maybe why still have this one take him to the bed. The bit he's going to start talking about me if I come back with another animal. least have him. checked out and see if he has warrants or anything to me will help them. And at least haven't checked out and make sure people care about I don't mind if I can find a home he needs vaccines, if you need whatever. i'll take care of the. Day just take care of you. But. yeah well. make an appointment."
9218.0,Patient,Good.
324.0,Provider,"I don't know i'm going to enjoy it. is nothing I mean is nothing like. It. they're really, really tiny and. So. And i've been always. Okay, and more so. In my last one passed away in 25th. and her, I was me me, and so I had her I had heard 19 years. Since from Toshiba since we go so that was rough and. I was like Okay, no more not not not now but eventually I will because. I know there's so many cats. need a home so. I was actually you know, like nope nope nope and then now they started just dropping out of this. Now they're everywhere so. I don't know i'm gonna i'm. definitely make a flyer. and put both of them on the wire. and i'm I should just do Leo on the flyer we'll. Definitely he comes from somewhere in this area, but. A couple miles away or. Something. yeah. So. Let me go get back to the room. um. I think I remember saying, if you. notice. In between last visit. If the weight gain hasn't increased any."
9218.0,Patient,me.
324.0,Provider,or about going forward.
9218.0,Patient,"I said it's about the same, I mean I haven't gotten a recent checkup. I might have to do that here soon. I still got to actually go over to the doctor's Office here soon and give them my Vaccination Card, because I got my second vaccination not too long ago so so i've got both shots for moderna. need to give them the card so that way they can make a copy. And yeah I can probably have that done there they more more likely be able to send you the information to see if the weights. changed. Because of which I need I need to get Ahold of scale."
324.0,Provider,"i'm curious about them with a mother, I did Pfizer did you have any. pets."
9218.0,Patient,No.
324.0,Provider,I just wanted more people. will have to take him out on. To the others.
9218.0,Patient,"I mean when uh when my roommate got it and because you know at that point i'm in close proximity, since I live with him i'm surprised I actually didn't get it, which is weird like I said I live in the same House or that. You know, but at the same time, we were also on top of it, too, we were sanitizing everything you know we're washing our hands that ties, where I am wiping the counters down, we made sure that no it wasn't going to spread to no one else. Like like I said, luckily I had the test done once, to make sure I didn't have it, and then I had them do the test again to make sure, and it was a negative so they were both negatives. At that point, I was like Okay, you know being granted yeah he doesn't have it now, but that was a really close call. My you know Okay, the vaccine. So yeah. yeah I didn't have any side effects, with it, when they gave me both doses they had me wait there for like 15 minutes, just to kind of make sure. So they did that both times this I didn't have to do, that the second time, but I figured I might as well, wait, just in case. don't leave things up to chance. So yeah I like I said I haven't had a nice terms i'm doing fine. They have to make sure you go and give them that. I think I might have another appointment scheduled here in the next couple months, who, with them. But i'm going to see about trying to get Ahold of scale, I know that there's a thrift store down the street from my house that might have some so I can go check. And they shouldn't cost too much either the db kind of inexpensive."
324.0,Provider,"I know. And I have some I will pay the price can range. an alarm nope you bought that was like 20. But. yeah. Waiting for walmart. Right, you know. I just you know. want to kind of keep an eye. On."
9218.0,Patient,i've been making sure like I said just if I if i'm having any times right really having a hard time sleeping then i'll take one. But as for thinking before I go to bed or some like really trying to take one like that the kind of actually do that and that probably isn't the best idea.
324.0,Provider,How has your anxiety level been.
9218.0,Patient,"I haven't really been too anxious, I mean. There have, so there have been some things going on family wise I have you know the that had me kind of question some things, but at the same time, you know. The things just happen, you know. that's that's just life. So yeah at the end of the day, you know."
324.0,Provider,"You know, no."
9218.0,Patient,"You can't really force people to be together. It just doesn't work. So yeah. i'll be honest that kind of made me a little depressed. But at the same time. I know it's, the best thing for both of them. No. I can't do much, other than that I love them both dearly. You know they're both good people. So something's not meant to be."
324.0,Provider,"Your sister and brother. I don't know if, maybe even just. Temporary separation. it's something that they will consider even counseling. We can work it out."
9218.0,Patient,Then they've been talking about it with each other. they've.
324.0,Provider,been calling it quits now.
9218.0,Patient,"I mean i've seen them put the work in for for the book and I think they got the right thing going they're both on the right path. I mean. There was, of course, some warning signs that were you know kind of spot it out with everyone with that So if I think eventually they realized that themselves and they wanted to avoid similar circumstances. Which is smart honestly. The other. they're both putting their all into it what's going on. But they do still care about each other that that does that remains there you know. Like I said I love them dearly it sucks. But. Really, what can you do."
324.0,Provider,"You know about you know in Friday and. moon you say. You know depressed. You know, so at any. point regarding. Do you ever ever have any. final thoughts."
9218.0,Patient,"No. Since I started coming to bright heart, I haven't had a lot of those thoughts since. i've been able to actually speak my mind. You know, and that actually helps. it's it's why I tried to talk to friends about this stuff that kind of really uncomfortable so I feel like i'm. i'm kind of boxed in. Knowing I can't talk about how I feel with some people so. You know, and sometimes with the way they say something it just wasn't it won't register with me, sometimes it won't click they get the opposite reaction from me, sometimes. But. yeah. It was pretty hard for me to be able to kind of talk to people about some things, but since I started coming a bright heart that's actually kind of helped me a little bit more. I just try not to hold all that stuff in cuz I know it's not healthy."
324.0,Provider,"No it's not and. It causes stress and then stress causes health problems. In it, and it will manifest so through. You know he'll brothers migraines or you know starting blood pressure, problems or. Even I mean stress will affect. It will. It really will. Actually talks a lot about. You know self care. yeah."
9218.0,Patient,"that's why i've been trying to use those tools, a lot more to that ashley's been given us to a group, and they have helped a lot to. Like i'll be honest that that day i've i've passed out, I was kind of worried that it might it might happen again on the road dude was office. So I had to I had to pretty much use those tools at that place so you know you know things starting to kind of you know if I started getting tunneling hearing again, or you know I started kind of losing sight of things. Then i'd still be able to use those tools to be able to kind of keep myself calm and collected, so that we're not just. Like tense or anxious."
