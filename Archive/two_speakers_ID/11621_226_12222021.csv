Like a room and they got that done and I I didn't I mean for both for 20 years I I wanted it. finished and done and everything. So it's kind of like bittersweet because he took the phone around to like let me see all the. repairs, but I was just like you know it's bittersweet because I tried so hard to finish how. Like. Like I just about killed myself trying to see how. To get it finished for him and I couldn't do it, I could it was too big house. mean only three bath or you know, like I couldn't not do it and I got sick and then, when I got sick I like. I had to have my I had a clean come like I clean all the banks and like i'm. people's houses and stuff like that, and when I got and I had a partner that I hired because I got you. So much work that I couldn't do it all by myself and i'm I hired somebody and that person well i'm happy to come and clean my house like.

Not i'm just like glad that. Tina my housekeeper that she was able to like go with help me with with everything i'm glad that part, I just wish. wish that he would have done it.

It doesn't it doesn't matter how much I cry how much I kick out my say wish it wasn't this way it's not change. me to even get upset about other than know why do you like. I guess. How I would have done it, you know, like, I would have. liked to like start in a room start it and finish it and complete it, and then go to the next room that's life but I like to go and. a bunch of stuff he started and it didn't get it so like nothing got done like nothing like completely finished."
226.0,Provider,So it's going to sell the House like what is the what is a face behind it is to get this stuff finished and completed.

226.0,Provider,In where you are in. Arizona.
11621.0,Patient,and He said he would go with me. it's like a really big. I don't want to do it.
226.0,Provider,You don't want to do the appointment. What do you want to talk about what that is.
11621.0,Patient,"Probably. Understand I guess American. Like. Right when we got here, because my husband is a really strong Christian and I had a lot. More problems, so he. found out about this lady on TV that had like a lot of the same problems as me and. He brought me to meet her for my first the first year that we got married and this lady on TV, I think I told her name is Joyce Meyer. So we started working for her and really close. really close with her and her family and her dog husband just the whole crew team ginger and stock lady and her. friends and Lisa video and Paula white and Josephine and TD jakes and mystery, you know just like. All these. People that know just to do plan as and. His wife and his daughter, and just because they're like all friends with each other, you know. My son got shot I dropped it all like I wouldn't pick up my Bible, I would say play for anybody I didn't care I didn't care if I died I didn't care if they that I really didn't I mean my kid got shot, I was like so I like shut down, I could not function. and So all this time I have not had any. Do you know, and she didn't like the way that I left she said. Well, I love you and and I took it to be there for me when it's hard for me, and you know if you don't let me know if this will be hard hard for you, then you know, like, let us know. Like we know what's going on, like so just like she said it wasn't. Professional. You know, to just like not tell somebody like give them a notice or whatever and and I didn't stop because I was trying to do that to her my kid got shot and he became my. Complete priority and nothing else mattered I didn't have time to sit down and let the whole team know this and that you know, like, I was trying to. save my son, you know. um. But she doesn't know that and she knows my son, too, and she loves him to you know, but I. didn't care I I won't let anybody near him and I wouldn't talk to anybody, and nobody was watching me nobody was coming over and nobody was talking to us and I just like it was done, you know was just. So then, as soon as my son got you know at least the House were on speaking terms of stuff ready to move to part with the feeders dad so because my husband is his biological father is he talked to them when he was too. But like he does have a different task so he would to go live with that and work with that and go to college and all that stuff you know and and I was happy for him, but I was still ruined from and never really, really recovered and. Now it's been brought to my attention that. None of that even none of any of my emotions Alex Elton a matter February 18 I have to be in phoenix. For February 18 and 19th at the dream city church. To help her again. and Just little things like i'm not cameraman i'm not at all camera ready like i've i've had accidents and then I, like my right side of my face like caved in I. fix cars that go like right here so i'm not this cute little dark haired girl that she used to know you know, like i'm. Like. i'm not good i'm 20 years older, you know i'm not 28 years old i'm 48 you know I I look blood and I asked a lot different and. Like i'm not going to. I shouldn't I shouldn't say what i'm not going to do, because I want those people that I could be putting on my patio saying i'm not going to church. As i'm putting on my pantyhose is getting dressed know we're going to go into church, but my gosh no but i'm getting ready to go to church and I know i'm going to go but i'm just going to run my mouth, so all time. Until I get there. So i'm like really and then I got to take it all back and then I gotta like, why do you. see that look, this is my me and my sister here okay there's nobody in here with me but i'm like having a battle with myself like this, nobody not trying to make me go or making me go i'm doing all this on myself, you know, like fighting with myself, are doing. And that's just like who does that you know."
226.0,Provider,"Well, just like internal battle, you know that's normal to have an internal battle, but why are you doing it if you don't want to do it."
11621.0,Patient,"I know right is it, I think, fear is fear gripped me that. This is the fact that I had I was like. I had my worst but like I had my best with God and i'm ready to have my best with God whatever this thing is, and I don't want to do with them. I am ready to do because, like the last 20 years I thought it and you can't get away from it like if there's something that he wants you to do. You might take a long Royal road, but you still gonna have to eventually do it, so I just like decided that. resisting. was worse. You know, like. The tension, the inner struggle. Here and. it's just one of those things that I told her right to her face that if she tried to get me to talk about what happened to me to apply I said I said I don't want to lie to us, but I will lie, he said i'm prepared for that and. That surprised me because I was like trying to stack or down, you know 5 million other people to go play with you know go talk to them and and. That was really rude to her to like. really mean like she stopped preaching in a room full of about 60,000 people. Stop preaching. And i'm way up in the nosebleed section she stopped preaching shut off all the lights in the room shine the one light. Directly just on me, let me up in the room is called me down to her at up on the stage I had to walk down like 1-234-567-8910 like 15 flights of stairs just to get. To the floor to walk down the front of the authored stage where she was that and took me a while to get down there, so the whole time she's waiting everybody's quiet, you can hear a pin drop i'm just tap tap tap turning it down to the. where she wanted me and she dragged me up on stage and, just like she did that, like I don't know 10 times, probably in 15 years I don't have a time that she could like stop what she was doing. I don't know I felt like a little puppet on a string make me too, and you came on and make you do anything like I. i'm not the person to try to make you something because. he's the only one that can make me do anything."
226.0,Provider,Why did she do what What did she do that why what was the purpose of that and why did that.
11621.0,Patient,"To try to make me not be afraid of. Her and what she was doing because. She wanted me to help her with. With her ministry and. I would write her sermon a lot of i'm a good writer she liked that so I had a really good ideas she took them all and use them all, every one of them. Get mine gave them to her for that reason. But you're not going to use me like that you're not gonna you know you want to be famous to be sexually abused by your father you go right at YouTube. But. i'm not going to be famous to be sexually abused it didn't happen it doesn't matter to me I don't care about near that means nothing it never bothered me even bother me to this day, is something that happened, it was you know repeatedly happens so many times I couldn't even tell you. It it'd be weird that it didn't happen, you know and like didn't stop me after I got married my stepfather was still like and ask us why that woman lost them so and so was some. perverse and I despise that. I think it's. horrible to. take advantage of a person or make the film I don't like that stuff that's. I think that's why I, like my am glad that my husband is 20 years older than me because he's beyond all that you know and much. These are really good man look that way he's very. protective and you know he. would never hurt me or anything like that, like like like that he's very respectful and and. he's really sweet, and when I just. I just missed it it's embarrassing to and uncomfortable that's all it is it's just very embarrassing very glad to discuss and have to talk about and say like no this thing happened to me like I don't care. Like what what it was you know um."
226.0,Provider,"So why do you want to, why do you want to do that, then like what I want you to be really clear on. Why you're doing it, and if you're doing it for yourself if you're doing it for somebody else."
11621.0,Patient,"See I. I don't like that. I don't like how I. Like all the stuff that she said that that that made it so like I just abruptly disappeared and she doesn't know why. and I guess I, I just want to repair. I want to repair that that one thing so she until the last time I seen her was. Okay, the last time I see her, she told me. She never wanted to see me as soon as I was because I had gotten that dinner, I mean I looked this up the other panelists like I did too, but I wasn't eating and I had a. I had a ear, nose like triangle that went from my ear to my notes here and I had six surgeries on it, because I got bit by Feral cat facing. Did. That cat scratch fever, I know that the Ted nugent song but it's like an actual real like. Serious. medical problem too so. I had to get six surgeries like on my face between here and my nose like six three different times so it was like three times three different times on this side, and then they had it to the side and i'm not gonna lie, I was. snorting a lot of hills, then a lot of drugs, because you know, and I don't do that anymore like you know i'm clean and suboxone really saved me and i'm all right now, but like at the time I was I didn't care, I was just like oh i'll do this, you know, so I just didn't care and i'm. And I just like went downhill from there, so the last time that she saw me, she said she wanted me to come back in two years, like she was basically putting me on like. Like. I wasn't gonna be able to go and help her because she wanted me to go get my stuff straightened out to come back and see me two years I don't ever want to see them again. And i'm and I haven't seen her since and and really it didn't have anything to do with with that part of it, I would I took that part and it didn't faze me at all, I was like go back years, two years yeah you know but i've got to like it myself straightened out, you know. It was because my kid got shot. that's why you know, like I. I had to help them, you know, like if he missed 66 days of school and. had to make all of that up he was a straight a student got a scholarship and had never missed a day school from the first day that he ever started kindergarten and now he's going to miss 66 days of school because of this terrible accident, you know when he lost his football he lost. His future it was military and he was going to do flights, you know, like he had 2020 vision and he wanted when he turned. 15 and he got his driver's license after that we were going to take it to the little flights, for that was a couple of towns away and he was going to start learning little to cedar you know. Starting from there, and that we had a friend that. was our neighbors that owns seaplane when we had our lake house and he got really good friends with him and he would take them up and explain a lot, so he was learning and then, when he got shot in the face and loss. Left guy. Well, he can't do that anymore, because. You know. I can keep you know wishing that that can happen and wish that I could have done anything stop but I."
226.0,Provider,So I mean like really like how. how's your son like How does he.
11621.0,Patient,"He says to me yesterday and. he's really happy and like he's. Working and. enjoying himself and. he's totally stable and fixed and and fun he's strong he's always been very strong but. I want it comes to him. he's like my Achilles heel. I just wanted to I pictured things different. I never imagined that my life is going to. be what it is now. So i'm rattling and i'm just like all over the place, but I just feel like. I need to just. She called me out publicly and in a private email and. I just feel like I guess i've always been one of those people that feels like they just I have to have a last word like I don't want my last words to her to be what they were and have her think. That is something that it's not that that happened, you know and and. and honestly I feel like. You know I goddess is very real to me. very real and. And I know he's real know I know that heaven Israel, and I know he's real and she knows I know what's real and there isn't anybody that ever ever convince me that what happened to me didn't happen to me because it did, and I should not be here. You know if you probably have met. A lot of people because of your job, and the position that you're in you probably have heard a lot of people tell stories about that they shouldn't be here. that's probably common like you. probably heard that before, but like. I was in a coma for. Three days. And not looking like I was going to be coming out of it anytime. and woke up a complete I don't want to say I feel like dory from Lima not any because she was the fish in the movie that have short term memory loss, you know, like, I never knew what that felt like it, you know, until now, after this happened to me that I, I still have trouble. I still have like there's a whole block of. Time and days and. things that happen, I have no recollection of like asked my husband, I was like I drove myself to that person's house he's like pookie. you've been driving yourself there every weekend, for the last year and, like are you kidding me i'm like I don't know this person this video is just like floored like I really put not for a number and then over. Time a couple weeks a little piece that I get a flashback and I go. Oh, my God that didn't happen, you know, and I was like so I stopped like running my mouth about how. I didn't do that you know, I think it did. And I just don't remember."
226.0,Provider,"I mean, is there a point where you can forgive yourself."
11621.0,Patient,"that's what I hope for. Like I. I want it over what I want, I say that, like all the time i'm like. I just want this done with a stone, I feel like this anymore, and I just want to overdo it, I just want to do something else you know."
226.0,Provider,"So your son seems to be doing well, and he. doesn't seem to be."
11621.0,Patient,Affected like.
226.0,Provider,yeah and so you're the one that's really. I mean rightfully so you're you know the mom and. It was a very traumatic experience you know but. You know what does it serve you to hold on to the regret and wishing things have been to France.
11621.0,Patient,And it doesn't it's a waste of time and energy and burden and pressure and just. discomfort and.
226.0,Provider,So how can you get to a place we're not going to do that anymore. I can you begin to.
11621.0,Patient,"Like. I actually read my Bible, I have to get serious about the. relationship that I have with God. That I used to have because I get up at 5:55am every morning make my cup of coffee get my Bible my notebook my devotional my remote choice on get my computer. You know and get like a quarter to 10 my dictionary, and I was starting my Bible study and I would just start breaking it down, and I would just start writing. You know testimonies and just writing every you know, like I stopped. And I don't pray for people anymore, I mean I did pray for my sister because that's different you know, and I, although I hadn't even pray for her for a really long time I did pray for restaurants. I haven't like lady into preferring any I jumped started her car with my bare hands state of prayer one time. AAA guy is standing right. beside me with this little traveling battery box that he wants to because her battery's dead and the car so he's trying to start it and i'm sitting there in my garage and i'm watching this. And I had the idea of like Oh, because every night I would walk around her car my car my husband's car and I would lay hands on the car. To keep them safe in the vehicle, and I would say prayer over protection over them, and I would just ask Jesus just to keep everything going I didn't want to need breakdowns accidents incidents just make sure the gas didn't even. finish before we got more just all these interface, and the night before that it wouldn't first time it wouldn't start I had been so tired of else the first I was like oh I forgot I didn't say our prayers last night so. I don't know I just like lay hands on the bumper. And said a prayer my sister hopped in her car and it took it started right it's like I felt the energy like left by fingers i'm like one. You know the car started. The a triple A man look to me today say a word is puts for quiver and he grabbed up the head in the sand, he got this cheaply peel out of my driveway and then every didn't even say goodbye. and never seen in the kid and then my sister said that her cheap that tape that yet never had any more car problems at all, so I he she sold. Well, I haven't done anything like that ever again that's. Not doing that, again, I was scared you know dead and I just like. To see brave enough times about something and then you're going to like get it, maybe, like the 30th time it'll work I don't know the formula, but it just seemed like. It all happen so fast, and it was just like really crazy and I never talked about it, you know again and I told my sister was like anyway that's happening. next thing I know people are talking about what happened i'm getting like knocks on my door pregnant girls are standing it. Will you pray for my unborn baby, you know I got somebody coming up to my outlook, and I mean like it happened daily, and I was just like oh my on. You know what is these people doing you know, and they were just like i'd be outside put the clothes on the line, and they pull in my driveway and want to have church right there in my yard and i'm like i'm doing my laundry not Sunday. And I don't know you. So you need to go trying to put my coat on clothes on you know just. Like things like that, like I get really i'm not as Nice as like person wouldn't even believe polly i'm Christian because it's just like I can not I don't i'm not nice all the time, you know, Nice and that's what I told her I said no choice you don't want. All this, because i'm not nice all the time and i'm like I don't even like you. I literally like gave her the hand up on the stage in front of the whole world, like the cameras rolling I don't even know what ever made me do that. And I sat down. And then she started talking and I thought that oh yeah I was still sit here after I just did that and she's just gonna keep on cameras rolling talking to the world. Now she stopped the share looked right at me and she's like like done anything to offend or or a base you and i'm like me she's like. yeah you. And I was like. I wanted to crawl under my chair and like. Leave and I literally got down on the floor and was going to do that and I was stuck on the floor I didn't call. A girl across the aisle. How to get down on before with me and help me up and until she like grabbed my arms if I helped me stand up, I couldn't move. yeah."
226.0,Provider,"So back to my question, how are you going to learn to forgive yourself but stay on top on topic here like, how do you feel. you're on mute I can't hear. Something in. Barely. that's good I think it's with it or."
11621.0,Patient,my fingers snap tonight like tap my phone by accident. Cheap so.
226.0,Provider,"Okay. So, but."
11621.0,Patient,"Before we end the thing is, is, I want to answer your question really bad and like sound like I know what i'm talking about but, honestly Sean I don't know So what do you think I should do."
226.0,Provider,"So I think that you know, one of your one of your goals, like the focus should really be on learning how to forgive yourself your son seems to be driving seems to be doing very well."
11621.0,Patient,You have a lot of makes sense.
226.0,Provider,You have a lot of regret and you have a lot of you're living in the past around that past that what.
11621.0,Patient,The incident that happens well.
226.0,Provider,"yeah. yeah So how do we get you know, to now like, how do we get you to a place where you can really step into your life and not that you haven't nasty because I think that you. You know you've done like you've made a really important move for yourself, you know, like by moving to Arizona, that was a big huge first step. In creating a life that you want for yourself, and I think some of what's happening, too, is that you know you really miss your husband, so you have you know part of your heart is still in maine and part of your heart is in Arizona, and you know you're trying to."
11621.0,Patient,True that's exactly how I feel.
226.0,Provider,"And you're trying to you know really keep on you know positive attitude, and you know, a. Strong front and you know you miss your husband and. You want it to be there and that's totally understandable, so I think it's about okay so focusing on. Okay, so what can I do until your husband gets out there because he'll be there right it's gonna be there, so this, this is a temporary. situation so it's temporary so reminding yourself that it's temporary and then Okay, how do you. kind of submit yourself there, you know how do you learn to forgive yourself how do you create you know, continue to create a life out there, like focus on what you've accomplished and focus on what you have versus what didn't happen in the past. So focus on what you're doing you know use."
11621.0,Patient,That you're right because. The House could have been perfectly finished and we still left.
226.0,Provider,Right.
11621.0,Patient,"And I never knew, if you were to ask me 20 years ago. I was going to be an Arizona. never believed."
226.0,Provider,So you know moving to Arizona was probably a lifesaver for you.
11621.0,Patient,"know what since I know that I wouldn't. have made it, I know, and I knew it too it's why I knew that I wasn't going to get another chance I knew that for a long time that. I was alive. solely because of somebody else, and not because of me and I knew that and I mean really new and this last time when things went sideways I woke up and i've never been like i'm still not you know, not all there, so I know that was really, really serious time. So look like it was."
226.0,Provider,"Everything you know that's the blessing so focus on the blessings that have happened in your life, and you know that was a lifesaver you know, being able to move to Arizona you're with your sister your with your mom you know you're in a really safe, good place."
11621.0,Patient,I really am.
226.0,Provider,Until your husband gets out there and then you all get to be together so. focus on the things that you have or specific things that you don't.
11621.0,Patient,"know, thank you for saying that because I do like throughout the week like are. We thinking about something and i'm like Okay, what do I need to do, and then your voice will come on my mind and and you said to me, you know just focus on helping your sister your mom right Alan that just like that's right i'm here, helping. them as much as I can, and I just like came back and like help me like mid week you know, like we centered me and. Like reminded me, so I was glad that you said that and. I. came back to. It came back in my mind, you know."
226.0,Provider,"So keep you know, so you know, keep things very you know just keep things very simple."
