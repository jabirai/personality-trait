10861.0,Patient,it's going pretty good.
148.0,Provider,hey what's been going on with you you're pretty quieting grew.
10861.0,Patient,yeah I know. i'm honestly there's like been a lot going on.
148.0,Provider,Okay.
10861.0,Patient,"yeah it's just a lot with like my son's that i'm trying to figure out how to co parent without having contact. he's been trying to like not go by the court order. and He was trying to pick my son up on Saturday and the court order state that it has to be a third party. He called the police and I told the officer as an officer, like, I have the court order right here on my phone I was like it's not allowed to be him there's a restraining order and i'm not about to put myself at risk and in a situation for it to come back on me. So the officer was I well what if I come with him and I was like no like it's your job to enforce this this court order like. You can't he's not allowed to come. So he eventually ended up like sending his friend to come get my son for pickup and stuff but it's just been a struggle he's got a new girlfriend so I don't know if he's like trying to prove to her that we don't. Like get along and he doesn't do anything for me. So yeah it's just been kind of stressful i've just been trying to like take a day by day. yeah i've been really busy i've been in a lot of pain, because I hurt my knee. him and I got into an argument. He had told me to go pick up my son's homework and his lunch box. But he was there with his girlfriend So when I got there he tried to act like he didn't tell me to come get it that I had just popped up there. So he came out like recording and like cussing and screaming and yelling at me and he ended up shoving me like super hard and he hurt my knee pretty bad. And it still hurts, I had to go to the doctors and get X rays I gotta go on a little bit to go get some pain shots and see if they'll give me some cortisone shots in my knee because it hasn't gotten any better."
148.0,Provider,Thank. You dealing with a lot. How old is your son.
10861.0,Patient,he's eight.
148.0,Provider,And how long have you been going through this for with with his dad.
10861.0,Patient,"Well, we were we were fine we were perfectly fine up until like two and a half weeks ago. yeah. So now um I just went and because i've had a childhood like i've had a family attorney for a while. But um I just haven't used her yet, because I wanted to save her for when I really needed her she's paid off and stuff. um so I finally gave her the paperwork for child support and to have on file that she's my attorney and the notify him and then we'll also have our Court agreement adjusted because it's 5050 joint he has primary. I want primary. of my son. And I want to change it to where instead of him getting picked up on Saturdays every week him getting picked up every other Saturday, so, then I can have him the whole weekend, instead of just like part of the weekend."
148.0,Provider,"Right right. Okay, do you think that that's reasonable or doable."
10861.0,Patient,"I think it's reasonable I think it's because I understand that he's got brothers and I understand that, having more time on the weekend is always beneficial for him. Because they're all in school, and then on the weekends, are able to do different activities and stuff. So, like, I understand that. But at the same time also like it's not my priority anymore, to make sure that my son has a relationship with his brothers, because you know his dad and I were together for 10 years and. He. Let his parents adopt his two older kids so they have just think coming and visiting like summer breaks and winter breaks like he's never had them full time never and. So now it's just he's got I guess he's got one of them full time and he's working on getting the second one full time. But it's just like for so long, I was worried about them having a relationship and then maintaining a relationship that. A like it stressed me out so now i'm just like you know I don't even care, like my son is my son those aren't my kids like. My relationship with my son is my priority and that's a because his dad he likes to use his brothers and their relationship to like manipulate the situation. So, like he'll call when his brothers are there, like on a Saturday when he's not supposed to go home till Sunday and he'll be like Bob i'm eggs here and what he will pull up, so my son he'll start going up and up like I want to go home. Like I hate you, I want to go home and i'd be like wow. So, and then like on my birthday on the Sixth he kept trying to call the talk to my son and I knew he had a MED, with him, so I didn't let him talk to him because I already knew what it was going to do, I told him I was like you can talk to him after his birthday party. Like But until then like you're not about to ruin our day. Because you're just going to tell him that I met there and then he's just gonna want to go there he's not gonna want to go to his party."
148.0,Provider,wow so you guys were together for a long time How long have you guys been broken up for.
10861.0,Patient,A year and two months I guess.
148.0,Provider,"I here in a couple months okay Okay, and you just recently started having these issues, so how long has his girlfriend been in the picture for."
10861.0,Patient,"I don't know um when we first broke up he got with this girl that used to be my best friend that he had cheated me out to me with him in the beginning of our relationship and he ended up getting her pregnant. So he was with her and then. Now he's with this other girl, so I don't even know and yeah."
148.0,Provider,wow okay. Lots going on with this um how are you taking care of yourself.
10861.0,Patient,"Oh i'm taking care of myself, just like. Okay it's still hard emotionally honestly like. I go on dates and I see other people when I talk to other people, but it's just like. I don't know why I just can't like move forward. from it."
148.0,Provider,i'm. And are you dating.
10861.0,Patient,Like I talked to other people and I gave people yeah but it's just like I feel like i'm always like comparing them to him and it's just like yeah.
148.0,Provider,"Okay, so are there still feelings there for you. yeah you're yeah yeah still hailing from i'm sure 10 years is a big part of your life."
10861.0,Patient,yeah and then he you know any he just act like i'm crazy for still like you know feeling that way but it's just like. We were together for 10 years like I gave up my college career and I gave up so many of my dreams just for you to be able to do what you're doing right now and just for me to be thrown out with my clothes in my shoes and nothing.
148.0,Provider,yeah that's not fair to you at all. Do you feel like you've gotten the closure that you need from him and express yourself to him.
10861.0,Patient,"yeah but it doesn't it doesn't matter to him when, and that was a thing like when we were together whenever I would express myself to him, it was just like. he'd always like I don't know why you feel like that you stupid fulfilling like that, like that will make no sense, your hell weird. He was just always constantly like invalidating how I felt like, and this makes me feel like basically done for how I felt because he took care of us, and he provided, like all the bills and stuff but like he didn't like take care of like me like emotionally I guess you could say. yeah."
148.0,Provider,"yeah that's really hard. really hard, what kind of support, do you have around you."
10861.0,Patient,"um I don't I don't have a big support circle, I was talking about it last night and I told her. I told her I said, like as I don't know how you guys expect me to feel when you guys still talk to him and communicate with him. And you go to his store, but you don't talk to them communicate with any of my other cousins baby daddies when they're not together and they brought them around to. i'm like how How are they, how do you think it makes me feel when you guys, are you know shouting him out in public and stuff and you guys are supposed to be my family not his. daughter like that makes me feel like like you're not there for me at all, and I was like that's why I have she's like why haven't you been coming around like that's why like I don't I feel like it's just it's weird."
148.0,Provider,"Did she wish able to hear that coming from you okay. yeah it sounds like you may need to set some some strong boundaries there. Because you know you deserve healing and you deserve to move past this and that's really hard to do and your loved ones are still keeping him, you know around and staying in touch. Okay um is there anything else going on, that you want to talk about."
