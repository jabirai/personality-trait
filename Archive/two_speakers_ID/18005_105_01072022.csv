18005.0,Patient,yeah.
105.0,Provider,"Alright well good, what do we got over there morning good morning to yes. So I want to check on audio and video so far I haven't quite been able to have a nice smooth flow of it, I want to make sure you can hear me okay."
18005.0,Patient,that's fine.
105.0,Provider,"Okay. So, my understanding is that we're doing this, this bio psychosocial this evaluation at possibly. The courts requirement does that sound accurate."
18005.0,Patient,yeah it was a it was a stipulation of a. Careless driving play it was part of the probation.
105.0,Provider,um how how long is this probation. Do you know.
18005.0,Patient,How long is over.
105.0,Provider,"So sorry i'm noticing a slight problem with the audio I only heard the word over, unfortunately."
18005.0,Patient,"So, as I finish with your program children."
105.0,Provider,"Ah, OK, so this is pretty important to you. yeah insofar as okay all right. All right, Greg let's do this and again your brand spanking new to this see if you can find in your environment somewhere to plop this device if you can so it's it does it's not quite as important today but somewhere stable for sure. And then eventually we're going to want it, so do you, you and I are like we can imitate in person eye contact as much as possible there's a lot to overcome today we'll go with way down here where i'm kind of looking up your nose. But in the future, just keep it in your mind back your mind I should keep my eye out for a basket or something to prop this up."
18005.0,Patient,"Well, I have proper. know too far away."
105.0,Provider,"Oh, for today it's fine, but in the future will be looking for something more like this."
18005.0,Patient,i'm not gonna hold my arms out like that I can't do that i'll go to sleep.
105.0,Provider,"All right, Greg let me, let me re explain. I don't mean with your arm What I mean is over the weeks just all the way through over time there's no rush over time just keep your eye out for a surface or a way to build it up, so that when you're talking to me you're the devices and down here just."
18005.0,Patient,That the place right now that works.
105.0,Provider,"For today it works. OK OK all right we'll get there, so today is a really challenging and we're already like it's already kind of hard already like content around here a little bit. But I hope that over time i'll have a chance to make a better first impression today is rough and one of the reasons why it's hard for everyone is because it's a two hour assessment. That I jam in to what will be about 15 minutes, so I end up asking questions that the human responses to want to offer an explanation as to why. But we won't have time for the explanation only have time for that closed ended answer, unfortunately, and it makes it makes me kind of seem like i'm a terrible listener."
18005.0,Patient,"Oh, I can yep."
105.0,Provider,"Okay The other thing is, it is being transcribed so you're going to hear me do this kind of funky thing you'll hear me say, please transcribe verbatim or you might hear me say clients time denies lifetime history of blah blah blah blah. And you don't have to say anything that's just for the transcriptionist. I am, I am aware of the distinct referral source it's not the same as you coming here today because you have this awareness of seeking personal growth, it is a different experience. For people that are almost like made like forced choice to come here, it is very, very different and I, and I respect that and i'll do my very best to keep tuned in to that aspect of where the referrals coming from okay. Already all right, so let me think quick little intro so you know who you're talking to I am here in Florida. I have been a licensed marriage and family therapist for about 22 years i've had a license in new Mexico for going on about four got it specifically to work with bright heart health absolutely love working with individuals struggling with compulsive and addiction behaviors. I use my phone just touch on a couple things that are relevant i've never i've noticed over the years. I use my phone for scheduling appointments so don't use it for really anything else, mostly just for hey you don't be there yep they'll be there you're gonna be there nope can't make it. Like that that kind of thing kind of just that way if. you're not going to attend just let me know 24 hours in advance, I usually do a courtesy little message I don't have to. But it makes everybody happy like you get a nice reminder I get to find out if you're going to be there, I am an independent contractor, so I don't earn a living if you're not here."
18005.0,Patient,hey new Mexico gross receipts tax.
105.0,Provider,say one more time.
18005.0,Patient,I said you don't have to pay Mexico gross receipts tax central Mexico.
105.0,Provider,"Well, thank you for that i'll make sure I talked to my accountant about that I still got a schedule it."
18005.0,Patient,Doing part time work as a consultant so be aware.
105.0,Provider,"So I didn't catch the last part of it so i've got to be very mindful so and I apologize for the clunky notes, there might be times, where I say great could you repeat that, and then I will be why. Is because it breaks off now i'm not sure what the causes, but we've got it because of the Tele health. I keep sort of highlighting i've got to make sure that audio is good, so it doesn't come across like like i'm not hearing you with my ears, but rather it's the relay coming across with the connection."
18005.0,Patient,was right. I hear you fine.
105.0,Provider,"right but i'm going to need every word, and I only caught the last one of this one so it's interesting. let's just play around before we start if there's any way that you think I could catch every single word, are you on an earbuds or through a phone or well we'll just go for it and see where it takes us then we'll just do our best."
18005.0,Patient,By phone on speaker.
105.0,Provider,"Okay i'll do my best and but just know that I might have to say, could you repeat that that's all okay all right i'm opening a note, now that means my eyes are going to be down just a little bit that can feel dismissive but I need to open a note, so I apologize for that. And you're in DR up real screwed with me right now."
18005.0,Patient,yeah i've been been in there twice. I really liked that josh fellow.
105.0,Provider,"Real likable kid amy right yeah yeah yeah. Alright let's see initial service okay so i'm going to be starting today, I tried to grab I grab one thing that I saw. That you had shared with someone else so i'm going to try to take the bits that you had shared and we're going to expand a bit on it, but we're going to spend time. right here in the front end talking about substance use history, and I think people may have asked you about it in the past, so my guess is i'll be able to move quickly through it. If I start preemptively by saying things like this, have you done a fair amount of experimenting in your lifetime, with different substances. No Okay, so let me rattle off a few if it's no just say no, no, no, no, if it's yes i'm going to circle back so, for example, if there's one you don't know the word just go with no okay this. This will make it go faster, so how about crack cocaine. No gap."
18005.0,Patient,I don't know what that is.
105.0,Provider,"Right salvia no. Okay, and no."

18005.0,Patient,"No, I never used it regularly I don't even remember it was just. It was in it was in the late 70s. I think it lasted about a year I don't even remember it's been so long, but I cried."

18005.0,Patient,"Probably in my early 20s. Now I haven't smoked that this whole time for 40 years but on and off i've quit and started, and I mean it doesn't take much to get an ex smoker to have a cigarette."

18005.0,Patient,"Usually, when it was around it was probably be from what I can remember to let me have some of that and I don't think I ever bought any and had any of my own. So I don't know if that answers the question, it was usually just been a social atmosphere."
105.0,Provider,"yeah we're almost there, though, would you say that you just took a hit or smoke, the whole joint."
18005.0,Patient,"No, I didn't smoke, the whole joint by myself, I may share share. Two or three folks I guess I don't know."

18005.0,Patient,"No, I don't think so."
105.0,Provider,"You know what I realized the I didn't ask if you'd had any bentos I didn't ask if you had any. Any xanax use in your lifetime. No, and what about a lot of people experiment with mushrooms, did you do that as well. No, no PCP acid. No. So talk about woodworking, then I stopped focusing where I needed to focus her okay very. See here Okay, I think we got that we're going to go to another section I was kind of winging it doing my own thing there for a bit I like to get that history, but now i'm going to do my best to try to follow this thing this stuff that's in front of me here. we're talking about psychiatric history, have you ever been diagnosed with depression, anxiety or any psychiatric illness. know you have you ever been hospitalized for a psychiatric admission. If you've ever been. put on any medication for depression, anxiety anything like that. In your lifetime, have you ever had thoughts of suicide. And so, is it safe to assume you've also not had. behaviors or gestures, where you were planning or we're executing on an end your life. know any homicidal ideation. You don't have that bad driver that i've got out here on the freeway then."
18005.0,Patient,When was last time you were an albuquerque.

18005.0,Patient,don't go there.
105.0,Provider,"Okay, I just kind of yeah okay next question any history of self injurious behavior sometimes we don't die, but will cut skin burn skin, in order to relieve psychiatric distress. No okay so client nice lifetime history suicidal ideation intention plan gesture or action same for homicidal same for self interest behavior please transcribe. Please transcribe his. denial of any psychiatric medication and mental health treatment history, but I want to double check on that for just a second um. Sometimes people go and they see a professional for sort of short term situational depression, anxiety sometimes from marital stuff was Have you ever been to a mental health professional. No okay all right tonight's lifetime history. So i'm the first first first one."
18005.0,Patient,You are.
105.0,Provider,Man what a terrible first impression i'm making.
18005.0,Patient,It up to see what I am LM s T was.
105.0,Provider,Oh yeah licensed marriage and family therapist.
18005.0,Patient,I find that out.
105.0,Provider,"Yet burrs yep yep yep so we have a very systems approach, which means in general or not like. You don't really do as much like you're the problem, this is the problem sort of see it as a more systemic. perspective I am particular been doing this quite a while, so I don't get too hung up on labels there a nice point of departure, but just works for insurance companies that works in in ways to communicate professional the professional but really humans are far more than just a label. Okay well we're moving on to the next section, we are clipping right along here we're going to go to the next one, which is. A psychiatric sort of family history where you adopted. we're going to be talking about different people in your life, but the questions will be the same, but the people will change you'll start to get the hang of it. we're going to start with our your mother and father living. Does your mother, have any psychiatric history or substance use history. let's make sure that we transcribe client denies maternal psychiatric illness or substance use history let's do that for the father as well let's just make sure that we're transcribing the questions were asked. Okay, any of on mother's side remaining there any suicide attempts with her. Okay. All right, i'm going to be saying a whole bunch of words and what they do is they capture the quality of the relationship, the lifetime with your mother. They might have been one thing as a 10 year old something else up here like if it was ever a yes, just so yeah. i'm going to be clumping them in threes but for no other reason other than if you were looking at it, they wouldn't be clumped you would just be like, no, no, no, no, no, no. or yeah yeah yeah i'm only doing it because the memory can only hold a few things that at a time so just whichever word stands out as a quality relationship that seems like it matches what it was with mother was it ever adequate closer consistent. i'm going to say it again, because I don't think. Oh, we lost each other completely i'm going to be."
18005.0,Patient,Without a question you just asked me.

18005.0,Patient,Much by pitfall.
105.0,Provider,"Alright self esteem, not an issue okay all right now let's go over to goals. Right now we're just going to do to we don't have to go NUTS here just don't put a couple down writing and then we're going to move forward you're going to have a very different experience when you meet with me next time because it won't be pressured. will be you can talk about anything but for now let's just think. And really tune into your own goal, not what you think I want to hear, not what probation wants but might as well, since you're here have a meaningful experience. Just drop into your own goals, it can be anything you want, and just sort of thinking of it in terms of what you want to do more of. Or what you want to do less of but they're your goals i'm going to be putting them in quotes because this isn't about me it's about what you want what's one goal, you have."
18005.0,Patient,To do more exercise.
105.0,Provider,yeah.
18005.0,Patient,"were like like I used to walk all the time, but with recovering from this broken pelvis it's very difficult I walk with a cane now. And I would like to get rid of that, so I do exercises to strengthen it on a daily basis, but you know it's it was busted pretty good."
105.0,Provider,"So that is the actual goal, and so what I do that's where this part gets a bit more tedious as I think tedious for me not you is about how we get to there and really understanding how much you're doing so that we know that we're measuring whether it's getting. More or less so, if you could sort of assess well gee I might be a walking. 10 minutes once a week that would give me a reference point, how would you describe how much you're doing now."
18005.0,Patient,"Right now i'm just doing it doing the walk in that I need to do. To get along and why you. are going to hear going to do this chores. You know, take them. For breakfast. I have to do, I use miles a day."
105.0,Provider,"Okay, so so here's what we're starting to get a baseline of client will increase from walking just for activities of daily living to what don't go too fast, where you would feel good about some small incremental improvement, what would you like to see over the next 30 days."
18005.0,Patient,"i'd like to be able to walk well it's winter here so i'm going to take that out it's cold. But I wouldn't I would love to get up to to you know halfway down the block and back, which is, which is a block. And then just keep going from there, oh I don't hurt so bad."
105.0,Provider,"So I understand it may take longer than 30 days and I really I get that it's okay it's just it's your goal we take as long we can always extend these so. Oh shoot I missed that last thing you said, let me be quiet in here."
18005.0,Patient,I said I didn't used to be able to hardly do anything.
105.0,Provider,"i'll see yeah you're experiencing a lot of like you're able to move around now and that's good. Right okay so shift pivot to something else to see if there's anything else. and see if there's anything that. you're coming in here for this. Under the understanding that we're probably gonna need to touch on substance use we're going to probably need to touch on it, if there's anything in that subject that you would like to do more, of or less of do you identify with anything that you want to see some change around."
18005.0,Patient,"um. You know I don't I don't think so. You know I haven't had a drink and seven months. hasn't been that really that no problem and wasn't that big a deal. So I don't. You know, after this whole thing is done and over with and all gone and everything. i'm not thinking about I want it to be over to be done, so I can go have a drink i'm not thinking that which, in my mind is for me that's I feel good about that."
105.0,Provider,"Okay um you mentioned cigarette i'm only bringing it up, because some people are like oh yeah I don't want to smoke anymore I just thought i'd bring it up. To leave."
18005.0,Patient,"It alone i've quit so many times and restarted it it happens when it happens, and you can't just say oh it's a new year's resolution well that's just dumb."
105.0,Provider,"Okay i'll ask one more question then we're going to wrap it up, but I just want to see you shared some some something that looked like a little a little tender moment around maybe the relationship with your 36 year old daughter. Is there anything you want, I mean you're here, you could, if you wanted to if you wanted some change in the dynamics with you and your daughter, this might be a place to explore that if you want it to is there anything you want with that relationship."
18005.0,Patient,I think her relationship with her mother would have to fork out of that boat.
105.0,Provider,"So you don't want to work on communication, you know I work any of those things."
18005.0,Patient,No i'm just telling you it's difficult because my wife relationship with my youngest daughter is not very good. So it's it's it's it's more difficult for me okay to be caught in between in the. One thinking i'm taking the other side and the other thing i'm taking the other side and it's difficult.
105.0,Provider,"Okay well we'll get to know each other more, but I just wanted to throw that out there that."
18005.0,Patient,"that's it that's, the only thing in my life that I did sucks everything fine. Okay, really."
105.0,Provider,"As you get to as you get more comfortable with me, you may decide to utilize this service for that purpose, a lot of people decide well i'm here, I might as well, and you are more than invited let's go ahead and schedule an appointment. Right now, and i'm. going to say. Real quick have to run a group right now but i'm going to write up a super quick little write up so that right, the Court has this little thing is little snapshot that you are here today okay i'll mentioned that you were at group I think you were there yesterday at 11 right. And then I will right and let's do. I."
18005.0,Patient,"Get out of that group yesterday was different than group the following Thursday there was different people, but there was some of the same people I didn't see Ray and I missed seeing Ray. I didn't see a fan. But I did. I did see bethany she was new. and I think that Oh, and I didn't see another young fella I can't remember his name but, however. I have. Okay."
105.0,Provider,"So what we're going to do now is we're going to schedule another appointment and then I can put that on there, too, I can say hey and he's scheduled for this date, and then I can put that in there as well. So I just checking you can always say no to me Okay, but my current openings are a bit limited because I didn't jump ahead with you and get this book, but right now I have next week. ooh i'm. Okay, I have January 10 at seven in the morning. Some people like it, six and seven in the morning, some people like those times you're asleep or inner you won't want those but you're welcome to it."

18005.0,Patient,"And don't do Thursday of next week because i'm be in the group, I think."
105.0,Provider,"that's right well, let me, let me throw something at you and see if we had a unique week next week. But if you really like this idea of really making sure you seeing the same people. We won't mess with this, but a lot of times what people do is they go to one of my different groups so that they can get the individual therapy, at a time that works for them, so I could tell you what my other groups are, if you like them, you could go."
18005.0,Patient,"No, I, like the one I did."
105.0,Provider,"Okay, then we wouldn't mess with that."
18005.0,Patient,Right.
105.0,Provider,"So let's get this in place let's go over to. January 19 at 8am. And that would be January 19 at 8am and that would be individual therapy with me, you would do the same thing you'd make sure you checked in."
18005.0,Patient,"yep there was a little um, but it was okay."
105.0,Provider,"And I will help you I will help you next time, make it easier, I have to jump out and ready five minutes late to my group, but I will do my i'm going to help you make it easier okay."
18005.0,Patient,"Actually, somebody right hard, I think, her name is Jana. You said early this morning here reminder. of your appointment at 10. He sent me a link and I just hit the link. And it took me to the virtual clinic and then I talked to a couple there and. Now, am I going to pay another $50 copay the next time I see you."
105.0,Provider,"So you're talking about something it's out of I have to talk fast because remember, I had a constraint."
18005.0,Patient,Go and take that under consideration about appointment after appointment after appointment because they keep charging and charging and charging.
105.0,Provider,"Can I say something, you may want to hear this. Okay ready it's outside of my realm but I will tell you I have worked with drug court clients before from Los Alamos and there's funding. talk to your officer because something's fishy about what you're saying, because to me there's a chunk of money. Just for this treatment, so it might be so I know I don't have a lot of time to go into more detail but talk with probation talk with bright heart health and get everyone on the same page if i'm right then it's going to save you quite a bit of money."
18005.0,Patient,you're not right it's that money from the county is only for people that can't afford it.
105.0,Provider,or don't have it. Okay we'll talk more I gotta go i'm so sorry.
