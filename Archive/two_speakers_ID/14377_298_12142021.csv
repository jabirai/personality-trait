298.0,Provider,"Okay, and you're propranolol 20 milligrams three times a day."
14377.0,Patient,"Well, you said i've been doing it two times a day and then taking an extra one if I need it i'm actually taking the propranolol before. The extra boost perowne i'm kind of not doing any extra boost for on like you would said and usually prefer animal is all I really need um I I have not needed the xanax anywhere near as much as I thought I would, however, i'm now down to one xanax, so I do need to."
298.0,Provider,"I will read, I will. feel that are."
14377.0,Patient,"Also, the propranolol. I need a refill, but I think it's because I like put some of my little pillowcases and put one of my car and one at work and so yesterday they were like you're not do for it, yet, but I was, like all right well."
298.0,Provider,So I will I will go. I don't know what i'll do what's your question.
14377.0,Patient,"I feel like I was, I know that you went on vacation and at one deserved vacation and I really like you, so I hope my calling and did not cause any problem for you."
298.0,Provider,"I was here, I was on vacation but I was here, I worked for all my groups. You froze."
14377.0,Patient,"I know i'm just not talking I had I was trying to reach out to you because I I. feel like I got up late and a depressant that I was on for a few. years. And then just left there and I couldn't get Ahold of anybody about the new medicine that you wanted, and finally the girl at the pharmacy said, you know we I sent that over a week and a half ago. And you're going to have to go through the step process and I asked what the step process was and she said, I would have to try to other medicines before it was approved, and then it might not get approved on medical anyway. And I. that's when I I asked, I called in, and asked the manager to reach out to you, so I thought you were on vacation. To reach out to you and see what else I should try instead I feel."
298.0,Provider,it's not sound lexapro.
14377.0,Patient,The less suppose the one i've been on for three years.
298.0,Provider,"So, what was the other medicine that we were talking about was it an Anti psychotic i'm not on."
14377.0,Patient,"Though right, it was it was an Anti depressant and it was try to relax or something you said it was a."
298.0,Provider,10 minute Paris Trent Trent telex.
14377.0,Patient,"Okay, you said it was an antidepressant on us, you know, on steroids and."
298.0,Provider,Except that you wouldn't want to take 20 likes and lexapro at the same time okay.
14377.0,Patient,"We we brought me down from 40 milligrams of lexapro down to 10 and then just kind of left me there. And what happened for me as I thought. I couldn't focus at all I lost my ability to concentrate, I was in the middle of learning a lot of things for my new job in the middle of their training. And literally i'm not sure what happened, but I could not focusing grasp information. And I was just kind of left there for about three. weeks it ended up being detrimental to me and I got talked to three times at work, about my inability to focus. And I ended up just going back up to 30 milligrams of lexapro and when I tried to 20 milligrams like you said for a few days and was still feeling sad and suicidal I wasn't feeling any different, and so I went up to 30 milligrams and all of a sudden, I could focus again."
298.0,Provider,wow.
14377.0,Patient,"And so, and also up the caffeine, not very much just a little bit. And between the 30 milligram the up to 30 milligram and then the caffeine, and all of a sudden, I could focus and keep up with my my co workers conversations. Whereas before I couldn't."
298.0,Provider,"So what i'm doing right now, then, is writing a 30 milligram lux well lexapro comes in 20 and 10 so am I understanding you correctly, you want to stay on the lexapro since we can't get insurance to pray pay for the train telex."
14377.0,Patient,"Well, I thought that we were going to try a different antidepressant."
298.0,Provider,Okay okay.
14377.0,Patient,"And I feel like there's kind of a lot of like i'm not sure. I feel like there's a lot of antidepressants out there, my My concern is that. I was suicidal and I couldn't even focus at work, and then I feel like I just kind of got left there. And so I."
298.0,Provider,"did your email and. Several times. Yes, and did I not respond. No okay i'm sorry. I just don't remember."
14377.0,Patient,"Okay. 20 I I think I think at this point i'm you know with this lexapro I obviously I think that there could be something much better, I would like to try different antidepressants I don't think it was working that well at 40 milligrams. But I had been on that for about a year and a half before I gained weight so so it it hadn't made me gain weight it hadn't made it weird for driving I hadn't had any word side effects and I can't afford to come off of it again. i'll end up losing my job. So I mean maybe not but we're really in the spot, at my job of them looking at whether or not i'm going to be able to do it, you know, so what I was thinking is just to stay on the lexapro for now. and stay where we're at with everything for now and then like a month from now, a month and a half from now, when I. When I have my job down and i've really solidified my place, then we can try MED change i'd never done a men change before really so I didn't know what to expect."
298.0,Provider,"Okay Okay, well, I think that's a good plan, and I think we should talk about what a month and a half down the road and what it takes to get a PA like. You know what it takes and, by the way, if your pharmacist ever says, I notify bright heart health of this and I notified your doctor that I never see those they're like gone."
14377.0,Patient,I never see know what it takes to get up prior authorization all I remember is last time I did it with a different doctor it. seemed like a big pain in the butt and this time it kind of seemed like the same thing.
298.0,Provider,"It is, it is the biggest pain in the butt having said that. The way that that it can be done is I put in a request for our prior authorization and you follow up with bright heart health and saying is this done is this done and it's usually the squeaky wheel that gets the grease on this."
14377.0,Patient,"Okay okay. Oh, and also, I think that maybe if we had just done that, like maybe a week ahead of time and had it approved and had it sitting there and waiting and then it's like okay crystal now go from 20 to two you know what I mean like. that's why. I like let's get it whatever you want me to move over to let's let's get it like primed and ready and then drop down I just I didn't I didn't see that coming I literally was foggy and I just couldn't."
298.0,Provider,"i've never even heard of such a intense reaction, but then again you're unique all to your own you're you're special. That we've you've had some really big reactions to things so let's tell me how are you taking the lexapro are you taking a 20 and a 10 or 20 an hour and then cutting it in half."
14377.0,Patient,"i'm breaking them in half. With my nail and just taking a 20 and that 10 and I have a lot of it right now that i've thought probably enough for the next two months. So I don't really hate, you know I."
298.0,Provider,I won't take give you anymore sorry.
14377.0,Patient,"So do you know what would cause that for me to be that foggy. It happened, so it literally happened in the second week about midway I hit I hit. With information at work, so I hit a wall with. Information, but I was sleep, I was getting good sleep at night and doing what I would normally do in a class that was a little intimidating or you know. And then, in the second week, which was the week that I went all I went down to 10 milligrams. In that second week. I was. I realized, I heard myself being negative I heard negativity coming out of my mouth. And then I was having suicidal thoughts, but not like all day long like I was fine all day long, but then, when I look back on the week i'd be like oh wow every single night. i've had these thoughts, the week following and when I had been on half and half a tablet from 40 down to 10 the week following I could not focus for anything. enough for anything but I was having a lot of trouble focusing, and so I don't know if it might if it like triggers ADHD symptoms, or I mean i'm not sure what."
298.0,Provider,"serotonin can work on your memory. And it's usually we say dopamine is what gives you focus but serotonin actually can work on your memory and when we took the serotonin away from you, for some reason, you are so. Meeting serotonin your brain just craves it like crazy and that's why a stronger anti depressant like to intelligence, would be a good idea. But at least you're getting. At least you're getting some serotonin with a you're getting a lot of serotonin with the high dose of the lexapro and we didn't even take down to 10 milligrams is an event that's considered a an average dose right there 10 milligrams but your brains, for some reason needs. yeah Tony."
14377.0,Patient,"And I don't know why it was on 40 I don't know if it works, I know it down regulates and up regulates I think it just kind of adjusted. Because I feel like I usually do when i'm on 40, so I think the whole three you know the month of tapering down. Possibly there were some some. Up regulation there and now i'm taking up more of it, I don't know."
298.0,Provider,"possible because the brain adapts. It is and sometimes when you take a break, sometimes when you take a break from something, and you give it back to it it's like oh yeah hey I got more serotonin now."
14377.0,Patient,"yeah so i'd like to I definitely like to be taking less of a medicine, and I would definitely like to be taking a medicine that really works, because I never felt like I got back to where I normally stood like where I was normally at for, for you know 34 years 35 years I never. felt like i'd kind of gotten back to that level. i'm just really concerned about performing at work, right now, like i've been talked to you three times about the lack of focus, so I was wondering if there was. An ADHD medicine that you could recommend that would help me to focus that would work with what i'm already taking."
298.0,Provider,Well you're on well you trend 300 milligrams three times a day correct.
14377.0,Patient,100 milligrams three times a day.
298.0,Provider,"Okay, so that's 300 milligrams the top dose is 450 milligrams we use that to help people to focus, because it works on dopa means. um and so you may be taking it for other reasons, but if you wanted to get more out of it, then I would go to another higher dose on that one."
14377.0,Patient,"And that could help me focus. Yes, Okay, do you want to."
298.0,Provider,"Sure, but I don't know who's giving you the wellbutrin but all I I feel confident enough to give it a try now, I have to warn you about the side effect of this medicine. Is it can take away your weight gain and not waking your appetite it can take away your appetite so weight loss is a possibility anytime it increases your energy so. Also, you run the risk of insomnia. Because in you have to take it low enough early enough in the day, so that it'll wear off you're already at 300 milligrams so your body's pretty used to it, so I don't know that you would have those side effects."
14377.0,Patient,"Well, the last dose I take is around three in the afternoon, the last time I take my medicine is usually never any later than five and that's if I forget if I can't get away from it, but I usually. Take it when I wake up take it around 11 in the morning and then take it around three four in the afternoon that's my basic thing um."
298.0,Provider,"What I would like to put you on as the extended release and i'd like you to take it once in the morning and then take it in the afternoon around one o'clock. Okay, so you take a 300 in the morning, so you would be basically taking all that you do it in the morning we're going to put that at 300 in the morning and 150 around one o'clock."
14377.0,Patient,The wellbutrin was for my last doctor for quitting smoking.
298.0,Provider,yeah and we're going to use it for.
14377.0,Patient,"Focus right now yeah Oh, but you. You had mentioned um. yeah that would help because I feel myself being scattered it's also just a part of my personality, because I haven't taken anything for it, since I was like 11. But it's a part of my personality that, for some reason is is been heightened. And it's really not working."
298.0,Provider,"Okay. Okay um keep me posted for any side effects. And OK, I will do better, I am sitting at my desk I will do better at answering any of your emails."
14377.0,Patient,Okay i'm sorry there's notes flying around about me.
298.0,Provider,Just like. I don't even remember i'm. Huge.
14377.0,Patient,"After a. While I had called and. Somebody at the you know the Karen navigation with compliance. that's something they blamed on the pharmacy I called the pharmacy they blamed it, on the Compliance people, and so I called and asked to speak to. A manager and i'm grateful, I was able to stay calm, but it was like okay listen."
298.0,Provider,Well i'm glad you were to. i'm glad that you were and. quantity must be 11 digits i'm glad you did i'm glad you got to somebody.
14377.0,Patient,"So um I have wellbutrin that's 150 milligrams from before. Although I don't have the bottle anymore I just. put it in a different bottle to keep it as a just in case I ran out, and I have, I have it in hundred milligram tablets should I just use those up first or is that, is there any way for you to know their extended release."
298.0,Provider,"there's no way to know. Okay, I would. use a hold on to those and use them in a pinch, if something should happen that you get. All right, take care i've got to go. Okay, thank you bye bye."
