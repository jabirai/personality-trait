252.0,Provider,You.
7884.0,Patient,hey you.
252.0,Provider,"know, are you."
7884.0,Patient,Oh gosh amazing.
252.0,Provider,You look good.
7884.0,Patient,"Thank you, I just woke up but I mean I gotta do a fresh look of just woke up. i'm good i'm really, really good things are great I will say there is something I should I should move on past that i'm sober and get to the. what's going on with me portion but just so we do take a stop at that location, first, I am doing, really, really well and i'm sober like let me see real quick. i've got. One month in four days. Nice yeah yeah so i'm feeling really good and that's going really, really well um during this time I was, I decided to sort of just take matters into my own hand and date. Somebody and it's been going really well and I was careful to choose someone who wasn't going to be dramatic you know or anything like that. But the problem is the sex is not working at all we hung out like 11 times and you can't perform at all. Like whatsoever I don't know but i'm starting to take it personally and i've been really patient with him I think it's because he's on lexapro. But then also it's like beyond just that, like it's like you can't even rise to the occasion anymore, you know what I mean and and starting to like. get a little hurt by it and it's also something that like i've already discovered in a previous relationship that is necessary for me to be happy, in a relationship is for the sex to be there. And I don't want to have to relearn that, so I am breaking up with it tonight after we go to knotts scary farm. we're going to not scary farm first and we already bought tickets so i'm going to do that, but then when that's over tonight i'm going to break it to him gently and. I just hope it doesn't go bad I hope i'm going to explain to him when I break up with him that, like. I am worried that he is going to take it out on me, or like try to retaliate because that's something that's happened in the past, and I have ptsd around that and i'm just going to ask him, like. You know what can I do to make this the least dramatic thing possible because I don't want to hurt you and I don't want you to hurt me, and that is something I am worried about, but I do feel like maybe we're better off friends, he would be a great best friend. You know."
252.0,Provider,asked him to get checked to find out from the doctor and maybe get on a different antidepressant that doesn't cause what.
7884.0,Patient,"I did, but here's the thing, I think that it goes deeper than that because, at first, he couldn't finish. yeah and that was the issue and that to me says lexapro now we're at a point where you can't even rise to the occasion and that to me goes deeper than lexapro I think what it is a lot of time what happens in the gay community is that so you know the concept of top and bottom right. yeah Okay, so a lot of times, most of us are bottoms and there's only a few tops and so it's like a mad dash scramble to grab a top. You know what I mean there's like 65 bottoms for everyone top and a lot of times what will happen is if somebody even thinks that they can top then they'll tell themselves that their top just to like be that special. kind of like. power to have that power, you know what I mean. To be like Oh, to be wanted and adored and and all that, but it doesn't necessarily mean they are top they're lying to themselves. And I think he's lying to himself I think he's about them i've seen this kind of before and I think that if he accepted who he really is he probably realized that he's more of a bottom and i'm 100% about them. not going to happen so it's just two items don't make a right like it's not going to happen, you know what I mean. This is doomed also I don't really find him. All that attractive. he's cute. To people i'm sure, but not to me, you know what I mean and the romance has been absolutely fantastic but The thing is, I think that the romance has been so good, because him and I would be amazing friends. And you know what I mean like the romance aspect of it, when I look at what is it about the romance it's good, well, we laugh. Well, we entertain each other well, we look forward to one another's calls while we're both spiritual you know all these things that would make for great best friends great best friends. And also. You know I lit a candle on my altar for romance to come to me and I made wishes and the wishing well to for romance to come to me and i've noticed in the past, when you want something that the universe doesn't like think that you're ready for. But you demanded of the universe. You get it and it looks like this, this is what happens, you know what I mean you get it and it's not quite right. it's not quite specifically exactly what you wanted it's like off a little bit and that's because the universe is saying you're not ready baby. And I have 30 something days so maybe this is the universe being like you're not ready baby you want romance, this is the best we can do for you right now best we can do is another bottle you know what I mean."
252.0,Provider,"I was just wondering two things. yeah okay coming from the life, you know that you have experienced right and the. sexes came with it."
7884.0,Patient,yeah.
252.0,Provider,That your expectation is a little high.
7884.0,Patient,"I did I did and that's why i've stayed with him for about a month now um because of that i'm open to exactly what you're saying. And that's why I didn't run screaming the second date because I took this to my friends and my friend, said the same thing. That you're saying right now and I heard them and I accepted that and I welcome that, and I also asked myself, am I in a place where I really want or need a lot of sex, right now, or do I want and need more the romance because he's a great kisser. there's a great color you know and i'm like is that maybe more what I want and need is that maybe more why i'm seeking relationship than sex and so that's why I was like okay yeah no big deal. But we're we've evolved past that into like okay it's been like we're in the double digits of hanging out now and it's still not happening so now we're getting into that place where it's like starting to bring back old feelings from my because you know when I was engaged to that guy. The reason we broke up was because the sex ended and so it's starting to feel like bring back that sort of hurt that I felt from that."
252.0,Provider,Eating like process obviously you haven't processed that her.
7884.0,Patient,"Oh no, no, that really hurt and it really threw me off my game to. And it made it made me feel like I don't know. Maybe this is something that like you might be able to wrap your head around as a woman, but i've heard from tops that there is no such thing as too loose. You know I mean it's not a thing yeah it's it's a myth that other women tell other women to make other women feel bad and, like other bottoms tell other bottoms to make other bottoms feel bad nobody's actually to lose. For you, to be able to finish, but to me that's absolutely what this is starting to feel like and it's sad and it hurts and it's like oh my God was I too much of a slight in the past, and my to lose Am I not fulfilling can I not make a man achieve orgasm."
252.0,Provider,yeah it starts building out your self esteem.
7884.0,Patient,"yeah that's where we're at right now with it it's starting to feel like i'm not. doing something right or i'm not good enough, where i'm not built in a way that could like satisfy him. And I don't want to internalize that because I know i'm hot and i'm doing everything I can sexually take care of him, you know what I mean there's nothing I could do differently or better I don't think. But it's also getting really annoying to every single time he tries i'm just like laying there, looking at the ceiling like oh God. You got it you're good Okay, no okay i'm just letting you know what I mean i'm checked out Okay, and so we're going i'm going to drop it too easy and I just want to go in vulnerable but also. Stand firm and what I believe and the other thing is i'm going to this like tantric retreat at the end of the month, where it's like sexual healing retreat with a stranger tantric Thank you, is it not tantric."
252.0,Provider,I thought it was tantric.
7884.0,Patient,"I think it might be tantric I think you're right to. yeah i'm glad I had this moment with you, instead of what. Somebody from. tantric uh yeah so it's it's tantric retreat where it's going to be like sexual like with a bunch of strangers, you know what I mean like it's like a sexual healing spiritual sort of. combo thing and like I don't want to be dating somebody who isn't even fulfilling me sexually and then go to that. You know I mean that'll feel weird i'll feel like cheating for sure, and he said he's cool with it, I told him, it was happening. You know, he said he understands and it's a spiritual thing and he's not going to take it personally and it won't hurt his feelings and he won't be scared or upset or anything like that, but I mean. He should be, because if somebody they are especially like really good and like. i'm just i'm finding myself right now really open to the idea of being with somebody else because i'm so unfulfilled in this situation and I hate that for him. I don't like what that I think that's disrespectful toward him and rather than be disrespectful towards somebody else for a second i'd rather. caused them a little bit of heartbreak for a moment, but by breaking up with them, rather than just drag them through the muck and mire of just not caring about them or not being as invested in this, as they are, that seems awful you know."
252.0,Provider,"It is, and I think that owning your truth and sticking by it is more important, it shows you know your integrity, it shows that you do care about them. You know, instead of holding on the hand, so you have somebody but yet not really wanting him and not letting him go, you know play in that mind game that is just it's torture."
7884.0,Patient,"So right yeah what torture that'd be a him and also like he's a top he's the assistant manager of a gay bar he's a yoga instructor with a bang and body like let him go find someone else he'll be okay he'll bounce back quickly. You know what I mean he'll be fine and let's let him go find whoever he is going to be sexually satisfied with that's kind of the spin I want to put on it tonight to it's like. Listen there's somebody out there who's going to drive you wild and make you finish and five seconds and apologize for how quickly you can like. And you're going to be super super into them and go find them go get them, you know don't waste your time with me be my friend, he might you know laugh with me talk with me call me all the time, but just be my best D yeah I could really use a solid gay male vesti. yeah and hopefully hope you know he seems. To me i'm not too too worried about the repercussions, because he seems like. he's so well adjusted and you know he meditates and he, like does yoga all the time he teaches yoga it seems like he should be okay. But I haven't seen his dark side, yet, so I don't know and i'm so trained from all my other breakups to be ready for the worst case scenario, so i'm not sure, but the thing that sucks is that you know i've been. I know the group said don't go out to the bar, but between you and me, I think you know, then it's really important for me to have like friends, right now, because I was so friendless. Except for my cousin I didn't have anybody like and now i've got a really good group of friends, going so i've been going to the bar and been totally sober and not tempted or anything and it's become like cheers almost. i've just become a sober character on cheers you know what I mean and. I really enjoyed my time there and I go there, like maybe once a week, but the problem is he's the assistant manager of that bar so i'm a little worried that it's like I shot, where I eat. I hope that this doesn't ruin things, and now I have to pay like full price for all my drinks again because right now, everybody because i'm dating him everybody who works in bar loves me."
252.0,Provider,He.
7884.0,Patient,And i'm just worried that like he's going to come in crying after this and then everyone's gay man.
252.0,Provider,spin welcome to change.
7884.0,Patient,Change all certain certainly part start paying more.
252.0,Provider,"i'm definitely it'll change because you know that's the system system manager and everybody's got the kids ask them. For sure, so you can expect that change right."
7884.0,Patient,But.
252.0,Provider,True to you. You know what I mean and don't shut him afterward so you know be his friend exactly what you say you want from it.
7884.0,Patient,"Even tonight because you know it's gonna be late by the time we get back to his apartment and i'm not going to have this conversation with him until we get back to his apartment. And then i'm going to say like you know I will uber home if you want me to uber home, so that I don't have to stay the rest of the night here. And that will be kind of a gauge for me as to how he's doing and i'll be like looking I listen, I want you to do and say whatever it is that you need from me right now, so that you're okay. Because i'm already okay that's why i'm having this conversation with you because i've already accepted that this just isn't working out. For me and the way that I thought it would now how do I get you there. You know, and do you need space for me, do you need me to leave not going to act bar for a while, do you need me to. You know jump right into being friends with you, what is it, they would make you feel good you know and ask him that, because. I want him to know that I do care it's not like a flippant but laissez faire just like I usually do with guys, where I just block them, and you know break up and then that's it and it's like you're out of my life i'm not thinking about you anymore, I do I do want him to feel okay. But I also want to kind of remind I just wanna be like dude I almost thought about I was talking to my friend, last night, and he talked me out of this, but what I was going to do. was engaged with him and sex and then, when it didn't work again inevitably stop him in the middle of it and then break up with him, so that it was fresh on his mind. Like why we weren't working out, but then my friend convince me that that would actually probably be sort of an attack on his manhood and so i'm not going to do that seems like a bad idea, when I thought about it."
252.0,Provider,And if you put yourself in his shoes. Imagine how he feels.
7884.0,Patient,Right.
252.0,Provider,"Right, he must be devastated. I mean that's a huge piece, he must really, really, really, you know deep inside i'm sure there's some pain in there because of that some insecurities fears some you know so you've got to remember that piece to you know that what you're feeling i'm sure he's feeling too. worried, maybe he's scared that because of that, you know, this is exactly what's going to happen, but um I would definitely walk them to be just like them see his feelings. yeah he that Sir."
7884.0,Patient,"yeah I want to just move respect but it's not walking tippy toes because i'm scared thing it's a walk on to it goes, because I want him to be okay. You know, but I also wanted to sort of accept. This isn't his shortcoming, it is simply because we're not compatible in that arena."
252.0,Provider,"I know. You it's easy for you to take it as your shortcoming, because he can't perform. So you're asking him to do something you're doing."
7884.0,Patient,That again hold on I almost followed that.
252.0,Provider,So the reason why he can't finish or the reason he can't even start it started to play a toll on your self esteem. yeah like is because of you imagine it in the reverse he probably feels the same thing. he's you can't expect him not to feel that this is his body i'm sure he's freaking out about it.
7884.0,Patient,"Well that's kind of why I wanted that Thank you that's the point i'm trying to make to him is like rather than us sit here and figure out whose fault, this is, or like both of us internalize this why don't we just let ourselves off the hook. And you realize that this is not, this is just us not being compatible."
252.0,Provider,"Right, do you see something ahead of time like he's having issues with it or."
7884.0,Patient,"No, no, he said something after I brought it up the third time that we tried we've tried now five times. And then, after the third time that we tried I finally just sort of like regressed and pulled away from him and started to put my clothes back on. yeah and then I was like what's going on man is that there's like what can I do to help you finish like you know or get you going again because you've lost it it's not even coming back up like what's the deal. And then that's when he was like Oh, it takes me a while to finish when i'm with somebody new and I was like is that always the case. And he's like well as of the past, like year or so, and then I said, are you taking any medications and he was like yeah i'm taking lexapro and I was like okay well that's why. And he was like Oh, I had no idea what are you talking about i'm like yeah let's pro makes it so that it's hard for you to finish, and sometimes. You know you don't really want to at all, and he was like oh Okay, it was like yeah I mean I don't i'm not your psychiatrist and i'm not your healthcare provider I don't. i'm not talking with you about what your plan for mental health is, but I will tell you, based on my experience in the past, there is a decision that you need to make between your sex life. and your mental health when it comes to lexapro or you need to get on a different medication. If you're going to take lexapro, then you have to decide, do I want to be happy or do I want to have sex because you're not going to be able to do both, but there are medications out there that don't have sexual side effects. And you have to slowly get off your lexapro and slowly get on to that one so it's a long process, it takes a while. You know, but to me. i've been with people have had problems because of lexapro but like I said it's just that they can't finish it's not that they can't rise to the occasion. he's at a point now where he can't even rise to the occasion and I want to be forgiving of that but also I don't want to sign up for that."
252.0,Provider,yeah.
7884.0,Patient,"You know I mean and that's just the surface below that deeper the stuff that i'm not going to tell them that's actually going on is that i'm not really that attracted to him. And you know i've always loved Latino men and black men and Indian man and Asian man and he's like as white as they come and so some part of me I need to work out what this is about, but some part of me is like. A little disappointed that I ended up with a white dude I don't know where that comes from. But i've always been like oh i'm not really attracted to white guys i'm not really into white guys I like. You know melanin i'm into like men of color that's my thing Oh, I really haven't dated or slept with a white guy like 15 years, so this is the first time this is happening. And every single time now that i'm with him every single time that a gay man of color walks by me i'm like Oh, I could have been you Oh, it could have been you, it could have been like I. I feel some regret in me like i'm shutting myself off to what I really want, which is to end up with like a Mexican guy or like a. Puerto Rican guy or something like that, like that's what I relate to my heart dreams up and that's probably something I should work out therapeutically was. I think that comes, I think that comes from being scarred by white men like growing up redneck like I think I saw like so much hatred and so much vile behavior coming from white men that like as a child, I decided I didn't want to be around that I didn't want to give myself to that. You know, and I think that's where my attraction to men of color came from. And it's like a deep seated issue."
252.0,Provider,yeah I think.
7884.0,Patient,"that's also. During this yeah and during my sex or two like when it got traumatic it was always white guys like you know what I mean like if I ever got hired and it felt very transactional and very dirty and very like. It would always be like some old man who look like Santa Claus you know I mean, so my brain just associates, like all of Caucasian men with like negative stuff. And all men of color were like sort of my savior and it's like that's where I went for pleasure that's where I went for fun that's what I want to love you know, and so I think yeah. But that's just I mean so Okay, so we know the culprit, but whatever that's still the way i'm built, you know what I mean just because we know why doesn't it it stops it from being the case, i'm just not that into white guys and so."
252.0,Provider,"Well, you don't have to you know you don't have to be that into white guys, but you also don't have to attach your past history with every white guy that you come encounter with."
7884.0,Patient,I know right yeah.
252.0,Provider,"You got to kind of really disassociate saying yes, that happened to me because those people are not good people that doesn't necessarily mean that every white guy that you've come across for the rest of your life is that person or those people. yeah right off the BAT."
7884.0,Patient,"Right and this dude is totally not that like he's super duper really cool like woken and really in spiritual and hippie and I couldn't imagine him being any sort of terrible in any way you know what I mean. But there's still that nagging voice in the back of my head it's like well. What if you accidentally Fuck around and end up with them, what if you marry them, then what are you going to do. The rest of your life you're going to give up on Puerto Rican man you're going to give up on black man really do want to miss out on that you know and it's like no like stop thinking that way. But also, I would I would I. Would I want someone to be with me, who was thinking that way, though, you know is that fair to him."
252.0,Provider,you're not ready to settle down.
7884.0,Patient,"Oh God no not at all, not even close."
252.0,Provider,So.
7884.0,Patient,You know I did this. I did this romance candle and then i've read dedicated this romance candle to me. it's about halfway burnt down i've gone through about a month of a relationship with a guy and it's taken me this long to realize okay there's a reason that the universe wasn't sending me to love my life right now i'm so you're right i'm not ready to set about.
252.0,Provider,yeah you're not.
7884.0,Patient,it's not time at all at all.
252.0,Provider,"Not at all, and even if you bet I challenge you from this point forward for a while that even if you find the best looking the hottest black guy the hottest Puerto Rican whatever it may be that you do everything you can to focus on you internally. Because life, you know yeah sex is important, but you have got to change that thinking that sex is everything because it's not. You know, I think. The most you know awesome person okay good example, what you're in the guy's awesome he's got a great personality you guys get along great like a friend, you might find that, and you might believe in somebody else that it's the perfect package for you and they might hurt you the deepest."
7884.0,Patient,Right so that's happened yeah.
252.0,Provider,"So you've got to really have some you know reservation, a little bit and realize that you're working on you right now you're not really so down. and give yourself permission right now to go out and sleep with every Joe schmo that comes walking in front of you."
7884.0,Patient,But i'll.
252.0,Provider,find that deeper you first. yeah right sex is sex.
7884.0,Patient,"I mean, I am very interested in the idea of having like can completion sex that's like very good, you know sometime soon, that would be nice maybe at this tantric workshop like i'm very like because when I was. You know before I was sober like I had bad sex like six times in a row. Where like they couldn't finish or they couldn't get it up or something like that, and then this happened now so i've got like i'm betting like zero and 11 like I got like that's it, you know what I mean. I don't even know if I did, that right i'm not sure how batting averages work, but you know what i'm saying it's like i'm losing. i'm really I could use away and so i'm open to that as like a hookup or like a friend, with benefits situation, but like also this has made me very aware of the fact that, like. If I can't handle this it'd be patient enough to like be with somebody through their struggles with FLEX pro or whatever. And it's making me want to just cut and run like that i'm just clearly not so maybe Maybe I should frame it more like that maybe I should because he knows that i'm sober sober and newly sober and he's also he smokes weed but he does a so he knows the struggle yeah and I think, maybe. talking to you i'm wondering if I should. Why don't really know. What to count because he still smokes weed so but I think he hasn't drink and like a year."
252.0,Provider,So he really doesn't have a program of recovery then either.
7884.0,Patient,He doesn't he just sort of borrows inspiration to not drink alcohol specifically from a meetings that he attends and a literature that he looks into but he is still smoking weed whenever he wants.
252.0,Provider,And he's also picked up the 13th that.
7884.0,Patient,"Oh yeah, I guess, he did. On this one yeah. So maybe he'll understand when I say this is a time in which I need to be focused on me. Maybe, maybe, maybe frame it like that, instead of bringing up the sex at all. yeah so."
252.0,Provider,"And you can always say listen, I had a I was I had therapy and she's telling me no, no, no, no, no now it's not the time and the beginning of sobriety needs to be exactly that focusing inward and it questions. You know I question his integrity when he's 13 stepping I don't care how nice he is you know, the point is is that if you're going to a you know 1313 stepping can destroy a newcomer."
7884.0,Patient,yeah you're right on that one.
252.0,Provider,"When I first found out, you know even what 13 separate man, I had no idea, no idea."
7884.0,Patient,"it's so funny that it's. supposed to be a bad thing, because everybody i've ever met and he was gay has been willing to do it to me."
252.0,Provider,Every.
7884.0,Patient,slept with like most of a.
252.0,Provider,Can I tell you that it's not just the gay community.
7884.0,Patient,"Oh no i've seen in the women fall prey to that so much, especially when I was working in the rehab it was mostly straight clients, I saw all the girls go through it. It would just get passed around. Vulnerable while."
252.0,Provider,Has that concept that if you care about me and we're gonna have sex sex means you care and that's not true that's not.
7884.0,Patient,"yeah well and it makes you feel like Okay, if you care about me that i'm worth caring about so that I can continue to stay sober because now I am validated, knowing that i'm a good person. Right, whereas what the other person is thinking is i'm sleeping with somebody who's an easy target that's all exactly."
252.0,Provider,"Exactly and that could cause more damage to mental health than almost anything. yeah I just want to tell you that. it's not about it early in recovery we don't have that that mental capacity to understand that you as a person internally are well worth way more than those sexual nights that you think equates to self worth because they don't. yeah but are in early recovery they don't know that. they're vulnerable and at their most vulnerable part when I first went into Ha ha Ha ha. ha, it was like sucking meat excuse my French, but like a meat market man, it was horrible and I heated men because of my assessment, but it didn't stop them to want to fix it all. In order to me."
7884.0,Patient,Just swoop in and be your hero.
252.0,Provider,"Totally because they were going to make everything all right and they're going to be the man of my dreams and I laughed at him because i'm not there, you know for a relationship I don't know who I am and I am an angry bitch."
7884.0,Patient,yeah.
252.0,Provider,"I don't want anything to do with any of yours, I don't want you to touch me don't you hug me I don't want I mean. You know, some predators, they will use the hug as an intimate form of getting close to you, I mean it's crazy to me, you know it really took me out of a for a while it really did because I didn't want anything to do with it, but."
7884.0,Patient,"It takes me out of a but while i'm still in a it just me out of a without me knowing it's taking me out of there you know I mean it may it changes my focus of. Every meeting that I go to to be like and I noticed, I still do it too and it's probably because i'm currently being 13 step, but when I go into the secular a meetings. A mix it up now, because it kind of like had a bad moment with the home group I had so i've been mixing it up and I noticed that i'll go in to the zoom and all swipe swipe and i'll look for who's cute and then i'll reach out to them and be like hey I need a sponsor. yeah because they're cute man me, ignoring the fact that, who I should be reaching out to as the women, they should be my sponsor I should get a nice lady. Who wouldn't be scared by my stories, but who also could like understand because if there's anybody who could really get what i'm going through it's a woman. You know what I mean, and that would be nice and safe but instead I always i'm like. check into zoom swipe swipe swipe who's cute who looks even just a little bit cute, and I mean who looks zoom cute which is. A really low low low bar because, like it's fuzzy you know, like it's a it's a video chat from like. thousands of miles away probably why are you looking for the cute dude who gives a shit who looks cute on zoom in their bed, while they're on call but that's what I look for just to see i'm just curious."
252.0,Provider,And I mean and I noticed when he's cute but i'll tell you what doing the same thing you always done you're going to get with you always got.
7884.0,Patient,Which is about three years sobriety. I keep on the way i'm going right now I can get it to myself about three years of sobriety I just keep sleeping with everybody.
252.0,Provider,that's your challenge. yeah find a female sponsor. yeah not a male sponsor. taboo off limits.
7884.0,Patient,yeah.
252.0,Provider,"You can look, but you can't touch. hey go for a female sponsor somebody that can really touch you internally not externally."
7884.0,Patient,yeah.
252.0,Provider,"You know what I mean you gotta take you got to take a piece of. The importance not saying sex isn't important but it's not as it's not priority over everything else that you need to get where you want to go. Right right. What do you think it, you know, everybody says, you know he. talks about being abstinent for a year, I don't know about you, but you nobody can be abstinent for a year."
7884.0,Patient,Now that's not.
252.0,Provider,"realistic. Right right, so you don't say you're going to be absent absent for a year you're going to say right now i'm going to look for a sponsor it's going to help me get through and learn about myself. Because i'll tell you what my sponsor she was gay there was nobody else I would have ever wanted for a sponsor so matter of fact, she she left to go to become a cop. And couldn't go to a because she was in the police force, I couldn't I couldn't like over I trusted her I believed in her, she was my you know my go to person and I don't care how much she you know what I mean was a police officer, she was always my savior. You know. that's."
7884.0,Patient,"that's thing i've been trying to fit like a square peg in a round hole on that one was having like I mean I think of so many of my sponsors in the past, and they were all guys that like. gay straight whatever like they were all guys that like I kind of got off on the fact that, like I couldn't touch them. You know, and then they all ended up being kind of hurtful in the end, I mean one of them was really terrible I never told you this, but it came out when I was in rehab for that one day I went to a meeting one of my sponsors. came over hi to my apartment once, when I was living down in. Hollywood and he told me that he used to make fun of everything I said. On my fifth step with him and his friends, not just his partner, but his friends and that's why we couldn't hang out very much towards the end of us and our relationship together because. I said so much slutty stuff that his partner didn't trust me and thought that I was going to try and sleep, with him, and that was part of why it took me a really long time to come back to a. yeah and he was like Oh, all my friends knew everything about you and we all used to just make fun of you, and he was saying this so flipping the and casually and I finally kicked him out. After he wouldn't stop saying it and it and I never really thought about what that did to me on the inside, I never I just buried that immediately and just it's like don't think about that push that down that didn't really happen. there's. But yeah he told everybody everything."
252.0,Provider,So wonder you're even in a.
7884.0,Patient,"I know yeah. That came out that one day I was at tarzana I walked right into one of the meetings and then i'm talking about sponsorship and then I was like Okay, and I just like let that out, and then everyone's like I remember, I was, as I was saying it this woman goes. In the meeting when she heard it but yeah I mean it really ruined stuff what is he is he was so hot, and I really did think he was really attractive, but i've never. tried anything with him and I was very respectful his relationship. But you know that should be all the more indication that it's like don't go down that road don't go down the road of like. Someone that you think is cute to be your sponsor absolutely not a good idea I need a woman who can take how ugly it got. Without being like because that's the one problem I have run into with i've tried having a female sponsor in past is that sometimes it's like for a woman to be a hoe. And for a gay guy to be a hoe or two different levels of whoa you know name for a woman to be a whole it's like she slept with 15 guys for gig i'd be whoa it's like he's up with 1500 guys. You know what I mean."
252.0,Provider,"You got to find somebody that has you know lived for life. And is non judgmental and you know, by the way that they treat other people in the meeting. And where they are in their life."
7884.0,Patient,yeah.
252.0,Provider,You know what I mean he didn't know that that's how you find them an old lady that's been in there for 30 years is not going to understand anything you went through.
7884.0,Patient,Right yeah.
252.0,Provider,"Just not somebody that has lived a hard life that is knows the students that has changed their life around to being who they are in that moment. And had some tough times i'm sure that there are people in there that don't disclose everything that that they've done wrong or right judgment right, but that does something to you when you when they talk when they share it's like. You just perk up because everything that they're talking about you feel. You feel. it's amazing when you made that connection."
7884.0,Patient,"yeah I will say it's been frustrating, because I have really enjoyed this home group that i've been in, but I will say no one. has been sponsored where the and i'm not one of those people who's really picky when it comes to sponsor I don't like this is uncharacteristic of me. This like amount of time that i'm taking right now to find a sponsor I can't believe it's been over a month and I haven't got one yet. that's not my bag baby normally I am like Okay, you seem pretty good let's go. Like I know that it's important that I just get a sponsor even if it's temporary sponsor, even if it doesn't work out it's just important that I. Just grabbed somebody who can like help me walk through the steps you know what I mean and that and I get that and i've always got that message, and I would always see other people hemming and hawing and taking their time. To find a sponsor and I always be like what's your problem, like it's not that hard just grabs about it, you know and but now i'm being really cautious and it's frustrating because I love this home group but. No one has said anything that's made me think Oh, they would be somebody I want to work with you know what I mean it's mostly it takes place in Texas to this home group that I have so it's like they're all kind of a little bit read Nikki. yeah and i'm just like I always show up wearing tight I gay guy from La who just chimes in you know it's like me. And then, a dude from Australia always go to this meeting and we're like the to outsiders, and everybody else's in San Antonio. And even though they're agnostic and atheist, and like, therefore, a little bit like liberal and woke and their demeanor they're still a little bit like. Like jarred by me and I don't need somebody who's like just because i'm a little bit kooky if you're like that already then imagine my fifth step, you know what I mean you don't even know that half of it girl it goes way deeper than just tie dye. So no. i'm trying to make. My meetings up."
252.0,Provider,Though go to a meeting in portland.
7884.0,Patient,"That would be nice I could see where they're all located on the chart so the only thing is, I mean it's worth it for my sobriety but it's so hard, because I have to do math to figure out the time zones and so it's always really pressing."
252.0,Provider,No time difference.
7884.0,Patient,Oh there's no time management important okay yeah so then maybe that'd be great i've always said portland is like if it weren't so damn dangerous that somewhere I would love to live.
252.0,Provider,"um well it's gotten really, really bad since."
7884.0,Patient,The drugs well and then drugs being legalized.
252.0,Provider,"And you know a lot of those drugs being legalized but. that's definitely a scary thing, but I love portland."
7884.0,Patient,"I know I went up there, once actually to film an adult scene and while I was there I was like I could see myself getting sober here I wasn't at the time, I was very much using but."
252.0,Provider,"very, very strong."
7884.0,Patient,"sobriety I felt I felt that, from the city and also it's just very like 90s and hippie and i'm very 90s and happy, you know. it's such a beautiful city."
252.0,Provider,I always liked it.
7884.0,Patient,"Also, like to that, like the COPs were going through on segues and they had like handshakes with the homeless people in like new the homeless people by name and they're like hey cheryl how you doing it, she was like i'm doing it it's good to. know and like they didn't try to move them they didn't try to like say you can't sleep here, they were just like brought him like food and then like kept going it was like this is such a utopia. so happy debris."
252.0,Provider,"is definitely a different different feel you know, then California it definitely is. And a lot of people, they are a lot friendlier. and try meetings, important."
7884.0,Patient,Okay i'll do that.
252.0,Provider,"Either didn't seaside Oregon which is on the coast by the ocean for years before a California and I was born in California so. You know and. But the culture and the support is ready, is strong. yeah very strong."
7884.0,Patient,Okay i'll look into portland. Right sure.
252.0,Provider,"three different meetings you know I say that you go to three different meetings three different groups until the next time I see you. can do that, you only look. For female sponsors I don't care if you see who's cute don't reach out. And don't ask them to be your sponsor look for field. Okay. Long term sobriety which means over two years. right they have their life together they're working on being a better person they're not stuck in the drama. Right they're stuck in the drama they're missing something. Right, there should be a total criteria what to look for I mean they're just really should."
7884.0,Patient,yeah if somebody would just write it down and. it's hard or something you know what I mean.
252.0,Provider,"Yes, definitely I had mind to kind of. Choose my friend before she was ever my sponsor and she guided me a little bit to stay away from not stay away from who was good for us writing wasn't good for sobriety you know."
7884.0,Patient,yeah yeah which.
252.0,Provider,"You want that same kind of compassionate person, you know."
7884.0,Patient,yeah I.
252.0,Provider,mean.
7884.0,Patient,"I would love to. i'm not maybe in portland it would go well here in La I identify as like a lesbian on the inside, and like a man on the outside, like i'm very kind of non binary and so like. My experience has always been more of lesbians and when I sit down and talk to a lesbian in La and I tell her that face to face one on one. they're all very receptive to it and then very welcoming. But if I go to any lesbian events in La i'm very much Sean like get out of here, what are you doing How dare you be here because of how I present you know it's like a beard and all that stuff, but I wonder if it would be the same, and like portland you know what I mean. I yeah give it a shot."
252.0,Provider,give it a shot what's The worst thing that can happen they'll kick you out.
7884.0,Patient,So what.
252.0,Provider,right next.
7884.0,Patient,know exactly.
252.0,Provider,"branch out, we talked a little bit right."
7884.0,Patient,I can do three meetings in three different cities or three different meetings at least. By the time we see each other next I can absolutely do that.
252.0,Provider,let's definitely and.
7884.0,Patient,Be careful I mean i've got the little book. I bought it so it's like i'm ready to go through and do the word.
252.0,Provider,You know what I mean i'm reading it i'm because it starts off with.
7884.0,Patient,20 different versions of the 12 steps it's amazing and then the last one is you write your own. Nice yeah. that's the first section of it.
252.0,Provider,"Okay, so you, and what I want you to do is explain exactly why you're there you can I have a sponsor. doesn't work."
7884.0,Patient,does not know.
252.0,Provider,"Continually you know, and you just explain why you're going to be open and receptive and completely understandable you're going to have some of them that are like well women's day with women and men stay with men but it's not the case anymore."
7884.0,Patient,"Right and, if you think that then we're already done anyway. Right I don't want to address does my sponsor anyway, because if you're close minded is that then like what are you even doing in secular a in the first place, you know. Exactly in the wrong place well that's that's kind of also speaking of. A little bit why I left my home group and why I haven't i've got to go and find new meetings now is because this one redneck showed up, who was apparently a regular, but he hadn't been there, this whole time yet so far and then he came back. And everything I said you're allowed to share multiple times and you're allowed to cross talk and secular a every time I shared yeah just share after me because I made the distinction that I was a religious spiritual person who just enjoyed these meetings more. Because I was able to hear God around atheists more than I was able to hear God around people who are religious. And he hated that and so every time I shared he shared after me and was like I just want to remind everybody, this is, you know secular and. I just want to remind everybody, you know we don't have to believe in God here. Everything I said it didn't matter what I said in my the content of what I said it just the fact that I said something was bothering him at all, because it felt very old school la it felt like. old school a like it felt exactly like what I was trying to get away from from regular it just felt like more of the same. sort of infiltrated the safe space, and so, then I was like okay Well, this is no longer a safe space and i'm getting. The same bullshit from this guy that i'm getting from regular a so now I gotta find them. Because if he's going to come here, I don't want to be dealing with that you know it felt like very it was it didn't feel very at me, it was very at me and he would didn't even. shrouded in mystery at all like it was very clearly, like a commentary on the fact that I was there and I shouldn't have been there, someone who believes in God. yeah and I was like that's fucking stupid like this is supposed to be a safe space where we come, and there is no. No right that's the whole backbone of secular and agnostic a that it's non judgmental and then here you are judging me. For believing in God and i'm like also I wasn't trying to convert anyone he made it sound like I was trying to convert them and i'm like I need you all to be atheist and agnostic that's everything i'm saying in my share. This saying that like i'm not trying to convert you I would be very disappointed. To find out that I converted you because it my sobriety requires that you are an atheist like I don't want to spread the word of God, please don't listen to me if that's what i'm doing keep yourself an atheist keep yourself agnostic. i'm enjoying that you know what I mean i'm not trying to convert you, but he heard that I believed in God it's like you couldn't trust me, all of a sudden, like it's like I was some sort of like outside infiltrator good."
252.0,Provider,"Well, that tells you right there that tells you right there how judgmental he is."
7884.0,Patient,Right.
252.0,Provider,There he is in his Program.
7884.0,Patient,yeah I always.
252.0,Provider,tell people that are struggling right. Because they're not their belief system isn't on the core. And they will fight everybody else's. Opinion yes cheers.
7884.0,Patient,"yeah I noticed that people who have reactions to me, and this happened in classic a lot to anybody who ever ever. brings up my share. always has a really weak program that I want nothing to do it. Because it would happen in regular to I would say something and then people will be like oh nice good good cheer and then somebody would be like. Well, I just heard recently and one of the shares and it's like it was clearly about me, you know and they'd be like, and I just want to say I don't feel that way and I don't think that's right and I always look at that person like you hit like you just absolute safety edge."
252.0,Provider,You know.
7884.0,Patient,"Right that's not about whether you agree with the last person who just shared or not. But people like, especially if I say something controversial and it seems like the group likes it i've noticed that sober people will go out of their way to sort of like counter that. yeah because I say a lot of stuff that's like unintentional and controversial just because i'm always looking for new ways to articulate stuff that's the only reason that it does, but sometimes it's like i'll say stuff in meetings that will make people think. Because it's made me think so, I wanted to share, you know. And i've noticed that this happened a lot yeah like it'd be like Oh well, you know somebody just recently shared this and I just want to say. I don't think that's right and that's not the right way and that's not how we do things here and that's December. And I always look at that person and they'll always be like fidgeting in their chair and it's like kind of rolling their eyes and everybody sighing and they seem comfortable and agitated and i'm like oh God you're so sick and it's like you're just coming after me."
252.0,Provider,yeah. You know.
7884.0,Patient,it's different.
252.0,Provider,"you hear somebody that shares after you that says it's in my experience, this is what I you know, have been been through this was my road. You know I. mean that's different."
7884.0,Patient,"Well, my people my thing is like why bring it up at all why bring up what I said whatsoever just share your own chat. Where you just waiting for somebody to say something that you disagreed with, and then you were going to share. Or did you have a share that you were going to share, regardless of what I said, because if the only reason that you're sharing is because I just spoke, then you don't need to share that's not a share that's cross talk yeah. And like if you."
252.0,Provider,Anybody should be able to see what they need to say.
7884.0,Patient,"Right, I and and you know 11 years of being in and out of this program i've never heard somebody else share and thought to myself Oh, I need to raise my hand and counter that. And i've heard some people say some fucked up shit. But I always still like okay well it's my turn share so i'm just gonna say what I have to say yeah and leave that person share to just linger if somebody wants to think about it, they can think about it, if not. listen to what I gotta say this is a whole other thing but not counteract somebody share i've never i've never been so sick that I thought that I needed to counteract someone else's share this so stupid. And you know."
252.0,Provider,Excuse me i've seen it in supporting that person. You know i'm really sorry you're going through what you're going through. You know here's my number if you'd like to talk to somebody you know what I mean. But it's just almost starts like a debate if it goes into counteracting somebody else's share it's not about that you should be able to walk. into whatever you need to on that floor and walk out without it.
7884.0,Patient,Right.
252.0,Provider,You know.
7884.0,Patient,"And if it was stupid come up to me, after the meeting and see if i'm willing to hear what you have to say. hey first check in to see if I even care what you have to say. And then, if I do then share it with me, but if not, then, like move. On like it's not your job to fix my share. Your job to police what I just said, you know so. i'm going to be. yeah so and apparently now, you know that happens in secular as well, so now, I shall be moving along to the next, another meeting, but you know I think if I combine. The awesomeness of secular agnostic a with the awesomeness of them, perhaps more liberal city like portland then it can only be even better. You know what I mean I think kind of like that San Antonio thing is sort of holding them back a little bit and how much they can help me because it's still San Antonio. You know what I mean. And so. And I was sitting there, I mean that day I was wearing tight I. With this background. Okay, you know what I mean and they saw that and I think that they were just like well what who is this who's this queer coming in here. Being on. You know, he was very like good old boy, and I think I just scared the shit out of him it's like, here comes this queer with his God."
252.0,Provider,And that was your home group.
7884.0,Patient,"It was, I was going, like every day, and nobody really came in to like. save me nobody really said anything like after the meeting and then like I had given my number to like three different people, two of them said they didn't want it basically and one of them like I texted and then G like. Okay, well, I have to go really quickly after texted her so I don't know they're really good in the meeting, but it was starting to really get to me and like feel like old a bullshit so that's why i'm like okay i'm looking for a new meeting."
252.0,Provider,"Why would you it's a question for you to think about. First off why Texas, why would you go to try to find a home group someplace that you know, is still having that good ol boy mentality."
7884.0,Patient,"Oh, because it was every day at five. And it was the only one, I didn't have to do any math on because the little spreadsheet had actually separated into time zones okay and, like the other meetings that just says. You know, like Idaho 12pm and then you have to go look up what's the Idaho timezone. what's the difference and then do the math in your head like you have to do all these extra steps, but this particular meeting. Is every single day, and it said, the different time zones and then it was, like all you have to do is click here, and then you signed it. So that's why, and then I just let the fact that it was San Antonio go and kept an open mind said, you know well, maybe it'll be. Different because this is secular a and maybe I shouldn't judge that it's you know San Antonio it was a red flag, for me, but it was more like okay Well, this is clearly been presented, you by God, because it's I mean you can go to almost every day is that five. You never have a massage during that time you never have your group reads during that time you never have. New therapy during that time, like you can always make a five employment and it's every single day so just stick with it. That was why but it's definitely I didn't see the end San Antonio and think oh I should go there, it was more like i'm going to let that go i'm you know i'm going to be open minded, but I see now that like perhaps region is important."
252.0,Provider,I think it is.
7884.0,Patient,not something I should keep in mind yeah.
252.0,Provider,Because you want a meeting that you feel welcome know you know welcome for who you are in her. You know what I mean. yeah not judged or. Any of that check just check portland out.
7884.0,Patient,"Well, go be my pleasure to get three cities."
252.0,Provider,"right on the west coast. yeah okay and go to a meeting there and tell me, I want to know what your experience was at each one. Okay, and what you saw as far as sponsor material for you female. Okay um and let's work together and getting you right sponsor that will help you through this stuff."
7884.0,Patient,"is I think i'm ready to i'm definitely like i'm past the preliminary stage like i'm ready to do work now. I know it's over a month now look let's go let's do this and I find myself i'm telling you i'm doing this like which he candle magic thing. And i'm finding myself craving work to do, like homework to do you know what I mean i'll be a lot of times i'm doing that thing where it's like don't mistake boredom for peace and peace for boredom i'm just like. Finding myself, now that this sort of self imposed do it yourself retreat is kind of over, I guess, and now it's just what is left is habit. You know, and I moved into my daily lives i'm back on Facebook, by the way, and it's going really well. But yeah like i'm back back back from my retreat and now I find that there are large moments or there'll be like six seven hours at a time, every other day. Where i'm not doing anything except waiting for a client to hit me up like i've already worked out i've already done my meditation have already read this that the other thing. And so i'll just stare peacefully and look at the candles as they burn. And sort of meditate or like watch TV but it's like during that time, I feel this craving in my body like deep deep deep in my spirit to do something like I wish that I had. A journal prompt or I wish that I had homework from like a sponsor or like some ceremony ritual that like a shaman told me to do where it's like I need to go out in the yard. or like you know, like plant a flower or something like just some ceremony something that's like. a sign that i'm moving forward like I wanted I wanted I want it, but you know. i'm at like sort of a standstill with school i'm still waiting for my transcripts to go through i'm at a standstill with like work where it's like i'm still waiting for clients come through like. i'm just I have these moments like yesterday all day I didn't do anything I just waited for a client."
252.0,Provider,Have you ever read out of the in a book workbook.
7884.0,Patient,yeah I did that's what I when I went to rehab we did the workbook so.
252.0,Provider,"The I work with to me, is one of the most powerful. sobriety books that you can actually work out of."
7884.0,Patient,yeah it is really great.
252.0,Provider,Because it asked the right questions you don't just have one question and you're supposed to answer it every step has in depth questions.
7884.0,Patient,Right.
252.0,Provider,hey everyone i'm. Allergies are crazy give me one second.
7884.0,Patient,"yeah no I did my fourth and fifth step out of there, I remember, I mean I did all my steps out of there, but the fourth and fifth step, I remember, was being so thorough. And then, a workbook you're talking about like the step working guide."

252.0,Provider,"Okay, so i'll send it to you today. i'm. i'm just going to go through a little bit and find exactly what I want to send you. And then you already have your other. assignment and I want you to go to different meetings like I think. orland has eight o'clock meetings seven o'clock meetings I mean they have all different ones time zones you'll find one that will meet your. Your knee and if you get in that board state right where you're six and seven hours, where you're not doing nothing, go to a different meeting in a different city."
7884.0,Patient,Oh yeah.
252.0,Provider,Take that time up okay.
7884.0,Patient,"God I literally just listed the problem and the solution, and the same model. i'm like Oh, I wish I had something to do I don't know which meetings to go to does right there I just said, the answer."
252.0,Provider,Totally did I don't care if you do it in a different country.
7884.0,Patient,Right yeah no me neither.
252.0,Provider,"Right, but I want you to explore, I want you to explore and I want you to go to different meeting so you're going to check out three different meetings from portland and in that time frame you're going to do the homework that I send you. And you're also going to find other meetings that you can go to when you're bored. Throughout the day right sounds good, you do that."
