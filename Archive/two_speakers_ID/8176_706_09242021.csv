8176.0,Patient,"Here does. It really does, especially with him, I mean I don't I mean there's not much more I could do for him and that's what I told a friend of mine, because you know I don't talk to my family about it. Because I don't need their old all the negativity from them tell me, you know it's a waste of your time which I already now. The only thing I think i'm just sticking around for is trying to get some of back some of the money that. i've used to pay his bills and stuff that. That think that's the only reason why that's stick making me stick around."
706.0,Provider,uh huh or you.
8176.0,Patient,"Know he's always got an excuse, why he can't give me no money."
706.0,Provider,uh huh.
8176.0,Patient,"And I even told him, you know look my unemployment has ran out searching for a job left and right nothing's I mean there everybody wants to lowball you. And don't want to give you anything I mean I was making more than $10 an hour in that's what it, you know i'm not going to settle for $10."
706.0,Provider,uh huh.
8176.0,Patient,"And I told him it be just like him settling for $15 an hour when he makes 34 $35 an hour. uh huh and I said it's you know it's kind of rough and I said, you know I gotta try to figure out everything now and I have no, you know I don't have him to fall back on like he had me to fall back on. And that's. That have you sure i'd the whole relationship, not only that. But the last time I stayed with him was back in February and when we've escaped ready to leave, he was looking for something and I forget, I think it was is they. And I said well okay i'll look in your tool bag and see if you put it down in air and. I started looking and he started to get real defensive about me being in here, which was very unusual because I used to work with him out on job sites. And I would get in the tool bags left and right he never said anything but then I had. noticed, I had with the REACH and grab a brush that I have left over there, and when I grabbed it underneath the brush was a bubble pipe."
706.0,Provider,Oh no.
8176.0,Patient,"And I had asked, he must said, what are you doing with that and he was like I don't know what you're talking about and I said look I said come over here look and he swears up and down that somebody planted it in his bag, but I I know differently. Because you know when I was over there and i'm like tori I was like. Why is there, so much, why is there, like glass from a light bulbs all over the place in a bedroom I dropped the light ball bit on my. This is a non go and I even you know even confirm that email it's like we both know this is an ongoing thing with the light bulbs. I said when you lived out East I said I would come over there. And they'll back the chandelier in the bedroom that he was running with little tiny light bulbs and i'd come back the next weekend and they'd be gone. uh huh and i'm like what happened to him he's like they blow okay one night we is going to bed. And he was over, on the other side of the room playing his guitar it's what he does a lot and I flip back the covers and there was a light ball burn with a stroll in it and. You know it, it was like what do I do now. And that was right before the sat down. And then I started just being myself from him during the shutdown because. seemed like the more. I tried to put effort into a more. He was doing the opposite. And I was out there, working with him until you know I broke my foot out there working for him and. I went back to work, a week later, because he told me that if I didn't come back out there finished a job I wouldn't get paid, however, I never got paid. And then."
706.0,Provider,"owes you money for helping them work, but he owes you money for you, supporting him as well, so he."

I end up going back to work, not even a week later, I was supposed to go see the surgeon, because I needed surgery, but I never wouldn't Had it done which I wish I would have had it now, because all I do is live in pain with it. And then come August. This is where he really started drawing the line and I started pulling myself away from me. My grandma died. The 24th of August of 2019. and I was in a truck with him we this actually headed to the hospital. And I was in a truck with him when we actually got the call. And my mom had called me prior to let me know that my grandma was unconscious and not responding. So you know we get to the end of the street get ready to turn out they hit the freeway and my cousin had called and I said this can't be good, because they're I mean they know i'm on my way all my family knows i'm on my way up there. I mean, why wouldn't I be on my mom's only child on my mom's only support. well. And then you know my I had cold chills just the moment my phone had brain, because you know I didn't know what to expect. And then my cousin you know, told me, she was gone. He had the audacity to tell me that if I shared it one day of tear ducky which slept the piss out of me and make me walk."
706.0,Provider,Really.
8176.0,Patient,Why because.
706.0,Provider,I was it so so important for him to him for you not to show any emotion.

I had hit So much for my family from him that he's did. If a then. A week later, after where we got exactly a week out there, my grandma had died. We decided to go to the zucchini festing go see a concert which Okay, we was I needed to get out and do something and get my mind try to get my mind off of you know, I was having flashbacks to see my grandma laying in there. and We get ready to leave and. He couldn't find his suboxone. kept telling me I stole my stolen oh man, I told him I would I still you know I got my own. Welcome to find out it wasn't even suboxone that he was looking for. We go driving down the road, because he said oh come on we'll look for it later and then he started flipping out inside the truck and he got the speed and he slammed on the brakes, and he was like we're both gonna die tonight. And I just looked at him like really I was like you know I just lost my caramel a week ago. It I was like i'm not even halfway healed. From Lou said, my grandma not only that I had lost my brother. On the 10th of August, which I really get know much LV I didn't know much about him, but you know it's phil was my sibling. And it kind of emotionally affected me because you know, for one, I never got the meeting."
706.0,Provider,And now you.
8176.0,Patient,"have it, you know you know, and I won't I won't never get that closure of meeting him. And then I lost my girl, you know 14 days later. And he's telling me suck it up Buttercup and this whole time you know when his he died up in Cleveland. They called me because I couldn't get Ahold of him at work and he was like we know you can get through to it, so I call and. You know I call this company and told them, you know look, I have an emergency phone call for him and I need to get through to him, like now he's not answering his cell phone and I need to get him down off of the scalpel and I need to talk to him, while he's not there. So they go one of the guys go and get him in. A bringing down and I told him I was like you know your aunt don as they said, if you want to see her you need to leave now for Cleveland. And, by the time he got home my dad had his backpack them ready for him to go, I told him, you know just go. You need to go, so you can have some closer with her before she passes away. His Donna raised him after his mom was killed in a fire."
706.0,Provider,"Okay, so they were really close. yeah okay."
8176.0,Patient,"yeah they were so they was real close together from me. And then you know I don't know what happened between him and his dad I think he was, I think what's his his dad working long hours because his dad built navy ships up there towards Cleveland. He actually came from a really. Well, I mean I mean he he from what I can get out his family, he came from a really good family. and"
706.0,Provider,People that come from good families can make bad choices.
8176.0,Patient,"Right and i've seen it happen with my with my ex cousin or my ex husband side his dad was actually a judge. And here he's outstanding and doing drugs so yeah we can we can go from both sides of the family. You know, he was shopping he won't exactly tell me about the whole situation of when he was sad All I know is that he was shot between the ages of 19 and 21. And it happened up in Cleveland and I have not yet to find anything on it. search all the newspaper. i've searched everything and can't find nothing i've even paid to do a background check it still came by and nothing."
706.0,Provider,that's weird.
8176.0,Patient,"yeah, it is very weird. And it seems like the more I put into doing. The more he takes so they knew me I had told him that he's very ungrateful. Any just basically it's a struggle at all think goes on about his business."
706.0,Provider,So what have you told him. i'm sorry this isn't working for. me. working for me anymore. This is a toxic relationship I don't need this this isn't good for my recovery and you need to leave.
8176.0,Patient,"I have, I mean he actually moved closer to where i'm at. And you know. He lives like 0.4 miles from me. And I probably only been there a handful of times in the last year and a half. Because it's always something i'm either accused of stealing from him or. it's always something when I go over there it's like I don't even feel like i'm wanted. Okay, so. I just distance myself from him because you know what's to use some me going over there and have to fill this."
706.0,Provider,"Do you have any documentation, as far as like anything he signed or anything that says he owes you X amount of money. For whatever."
8176.0,Patient,"No, I only have receipts like where I paid on his restitution. Where I paid his gas and electric bill, I only have received what my credit what you know what my debit card in the numbers."
706.0,Provider,"You have that I mean so worst case scenario, I mean you can take him to small claims court."
8176.0,Patient,yeah ID then brought that up to him and he was like you know bang will get shipped because i'll run to another state before they get me.
706.0,Provider,"Okay, oh. But then at least you did what."
8176.0,Patient,"You said. Right, so you don't know. about it would cost me money I don't have to take him to court."
706.0,Provider,"it's like a couple hundred dollars, I think, but if you win, then he has to pay."
8176.0,Patient,"Well i've kind of learned from that to that he's been paying on this restitution since 2010. And he should have already had it paid off, he only pays it when. he feels like paying them and now they're starting to suspended driver's license when he doesn't pay well his driver's license got suspended on my birthday last month. and You know I he called me yelling and screaming why didn't you make the payment why didn't you make the payment so for one it didn't concern me too. it's not my responsibility."
706.0,Provider,it's not yours to pay.
8176.0,Patient,"Three I don't have the money. I said when you called me and told me, you know, I have the money for my electric it just got shut off, I have the money in cash, can you pay it for me, I said sure long today too much, and I got the money in the bank. I went ahead and paid it and he was like well on my way to lowes i'll drop the money off which okay. Because he wouldn't have had no problems it wouldn't have been out with like all we had to do was come down turn onto my street. And then go straight and basically he was at lowes that's how close we are to lowes. and I had called in, because it was like an hour and I said, did you forget no I figured that you didn't want to get wet and run outside in the rain. And I said that's not a good excuse. He was like Okay, he was, like all drop it, he was, like all when I leave here i'll bring it to you, I said okay that's fine. never brought it."
706.0,Provider,"So. He doesn't live with you but you're still in a relationship with him he's using you what makes you stick around and you said that hopefully you're like well, maybe i'll get some of my money back, but it doesn't sound like that's going to happen."
8176.0,Patient,"Right in. You know i'm the more and more every day goes by I just myself a little bit more probably my get to the point to where i'm not even calling and texting him anymore. I will call it texting and asking me know hey are you Okay, other than that. I really don't have much more to say pilling. Because it's. it's always something my kids for bad. kid this my kids are that. My mom's this my mom's that you know Come on, do I mean my family took you when when you all, you had was a suitcase."

706.0,Provider,mm hmm.
8176.0,Patient,"But what what I don't understand when it comes down to the kids I don't judge his kids. I keep my kids distance from his kids. before his son was even 18 his son, I was already a felon. And I had brought up the situation you know. Instead of, say, an apple didn't fall far from the tree, you would want to kick that apple as far as weight from that tree as possible, because no parent wants their son or daughter, to be like them. And I said, believe me if I thought the apple fell real close to that tree with my kids. I would kick it as far as I could kick it. Because I do not want neither one of my kids to have an addiction."
706.0,Provider,yeah for sure.
8176.0,Patient,"And he thinks it's funny I mean his son still out there do, and he thinks it's funny. And I said, you know. I said it ain't gonna be funny that night, the day you get that phone call or they're not going to door saying that your son's laying in the morgue."
706.0,Provider,yeah no kidding.
8176.0,Patient,"And I said, you know I don't wish that on. Nobody, because I have two grown kids myself. I said but I don't wish that on nobody, but then he wants to make fun of my youngest son my youngest son was born premature. and He is autistic. But you know my son is smart in ways that people wouldn't even imagine. He does have problems with reading and writing. But you could sit down and talk to him and. There was things I didn't even know I mean I grew up watching Willie walton and he was like mom did you know that in Willy Wonka they show hitler's part of Hitler on the newspaper and i'm like no. And also have another scene, Willy Wonka hundred times. And I mean there's just some things that he's very fascinated with him. He loves to cook I mean he can cook sometimes he can cook better than me. But you know I don't judge this kid and I don't expect him to juggle mine and I told him the relationship is not about kids it's not about our kids it's about."
706.0,Provider,Absolutely.
8176.0,Patient,"And then he tells me well, your kids it's got two different dads well. yeah I understand them, and I don't hide it from nobody because my kids look like night and day one Scott black hair one's got blond hair, you can tell, they don't have the same dad."
706.0,Provider,And I don't try to hide it I got my divorce in 99 my son was born in 2001.
8176.0,Patient,"Of course he came after my divorce. And I said, you know things happen that we can't control."
706.0,Provider,Absolutely.
8176.0,Patient,"And I said I was in a very toxic marriage, you know it was best I got married at 18 so it was best for me to to go ahead and get my divorce."
706.0,Provider,"Well, and it seems like you still are seeking out toxic relationships and I think that."
8176.0,Patient,it's like it's like one after another.
706.0,Provider,"yeah, and so I think that what, in order to stop that from happening, you have to. that's happening."

706.0,Provider,You deserve better.
8176.0,Patient,Right and that's what this whole lockdown i've had a lot of eye opening. A lot of eye opening.
706.0,Provider,Oh i'm sure.
8176.0,Patient,"Just like I i've been calling in Texas, you know I called in texting, you know, a couple of times during the week and said hey you know. yeah i'll be out in a minute. I said, you know I need you to drop me off a little bit of money or a couple packs of cigarettes i'm down to, and I have no money. Nothing."
706.0,Provider,Just didn't care.
8176.0,Patient,"No he don't care. nope I could call him right now until I made look I I don't have no food or nothing, and he wouldn't he. wouldn't even acknowledge it tell me I don't have nothing to do with me."
706.0,Provider,So I think it's time that you just have nothing to do with him.
8176.0,Patient,"yeah i've even asked him i've been asking a lot if I just come get my things from there, and he won't let me. So you know, I was talking to my cousin and I told her you know I might just happen mark it up as a last call take the wall single on."

706.0,Provider,"uh huh, but I think you know, like I said, I think that discarding from your life that toxicity getting that toxicity gone it's going to help you to make you better it's going to help you you're going to feel better about yourself."
8176.0,Patient,"Right, because you know what. And it's Sad to say. I through 20 some years of sobriety away because of him. i'm In summary, I will not do it again."
