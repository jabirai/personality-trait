So i'm reviewing with everyone to see if right now, they feel like that they're getting the support i'm just going to put here next. session i'll send this to your email real quick. Okay now is at 330. So right now for week it's saying let's see four groups it's set at a weekly care intensity, do you feel like that weekly right now is the support that you need or do sometimes people feel like they may be.
