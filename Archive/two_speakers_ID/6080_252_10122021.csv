6080.0,Patient,Hello. hey.
252.0,Provider,How are you.
6080.0,Patient,"Good I mean. tricking better. um my mom died. With Kobe. Oh no yeah so. um. I had to. Basically, so she she got cold so apparently she went in August 31 and then her nurse or caretaker called me September 1 and was like hey I haven't heard anything from your mom. it's been you know all night I don't know what's going on, she just said she felt sick and, like my mom suffers from that or. Well, my mom used to suffer from diabetes and so she was kind of thinking like Maybe it was like a diabetic situation because, like she lost her toe last year, and so um she called me and. I, and I don't know I guess like there was an emergency contact, I was, I was the emergency contact on my mom's like account or whatever. And so I called the hospital because there's nothing like it's only family members can actually call and so they're like yes she's in a coma and I was like what. What do you mean she was in a coma like with what and I was, I was like you like, what do you mean and they're like yeah we put her on a ventilator and like it was like instinctual like I knew it was Cobra like I just. because she didn't have the vaccine. Like she refused to get it, which it's like it baffles my mind, because my mom wore a mask all the time, like. She was super like democratic she like she was not like any of those like trump people that are like anti matt a skirt any like. But she refused to get it cuz she said Oh well, she couldn't have it, because there was hill iselin and she was allergic to penicillin which you and I both know there's no penicillin in it like like they tell you what's in the fucking drug like the doctors will not tell you to get something. If they know that you're medically couldn't take what was ever in it, you know, and I mean and like. And so I got the call. And I call them, and it was like. um I had a doctor's appointment literally like an hour later so like i'm calling all my family i'm calling like the doctors back like i'm also trying to go to my appointment and like. Trying to do all of this. And she like. She couldn't beat it and I had to take her off."
252.0,Provider,And a.
6080.0,Patient,"Big old. Because like I didn't I didn't. My aunt recently lost her her daughter to suicide earlier this year, she didn't need to go through it my uncle. Like it my grandpa my grandma they didn't need to make that decision, like it should have been them because you know they're still relatively young, but like. No one should have to put their daughter. off of it like no one no parent to lose a child, like over. And like with my aunt losing her daughter this year and her grandson because she was pregnant at the time. He let yeah. So, and then like a few months later, my other cousin tried to commit suicide my aunt tried to commit suicide again so it was just like. Our family has gone through so much heartbreak this year. So um. So, then, I had to basically come up with money my so one of my family members, decided to pay for it. And then, once when I can gain. Access to. The rest of the money that's in her checking account like i'm just going to send it to him and like come up with the payment plan, but it's like. You all acted like he loved my mother and you lost like this person and none of you were close to my mom in the last 10 years or even before that, like my mom was the outcast and the crazy one and. Like yeah like I was adopted, and I, and like that's what I like really hey it's like I missed years with her and she was only 49. And i'm only 31 and. She didn't get to see me try for kids like. And that's all i've been trying to work towards is having kids and. i'm like the next I told her, I was like it within the next year mom within like the next like six to like nine months like like i'm really working on it like a really trying like i'm trying to lose weight like i'm i'm on this new medication to help me like. Like. And she's not even going to be here to see it like and I know I get that everyone's like oh she's in a better place, but like. I don't want to hear that, like it's not something that, like, I want to hear at this point, right now. and So I had in my mom's a hoarder so that was. I had to go to it, or I had to go to Vegas. I had to like rush to Vegas um I had to pay for her storage in Vegas so I can even get gain access into her stuff. And she had like 60 boxes, I can only go through like 25 and then my uncle was like we should just call it quits. And i'm like. But what if there's pictures like what if there's something there that like. So I I was like fine and I let it go. Then we drove over to long beach because that's where my mom lives. And that was really upsetting to see that house, the way that it was because we didn't think that it got that but. I didn't think that that disease got bad for her. Like. I didn't I didn't I didn't. I didn't think that it got that bad. And it did. And that's what. Also, makes me so mad. and angry because me my grandpa my uncle over there. Like. going through it all and trying a like luckily my grandma found my baby pictures, because my grandma flew down. And she found my baby pictures, and I mean it's not many but it's like enough. and i've just heartbroken because. I don't even really remember the last conversation I had with her, I know. i'll never hear her voice again like I can never go her. journey making those decisions were really hard. and I decided not to go to their celebration of life or whatever. um I chose to stay home and thankfully I did because they didn't even cremate her. Because they were waiting for the doctor to sign the paper, but then they may need call the doctor i'm like isn't this what I paid you to do like I paid you to deal with this still like. Why would me calling make it any difference, you know, and I mean, like you, you guys are the crematorium like you guys deal with this and I get la is so busy or long beach or whatever and there's a lot of people and people are dying every day down there and stuff like that I get that. But it's like. I thought she was already done, like, I thought it was already done and and and and ready to go, because they wanted the does the ceremony. On the second. So. I just miss her so much and I didn't know it because, even if, like we didn't have the greatest conversation in the world. I, Mr I miss her like like. and grief is so different. than how I expected it to be with my mom because. Because I always thought like if any of my parents died like I wouldn't chair the Chair like I would cry I wouldn't. I wouldn't feel bad because they abused me my whole life they fucked me up like i'm fucked up because. and But she's my mom she gave birth to me like she's the reason i'm here. Because they could have had the simple way out my mom was 17 like. She could have. She could have had an abortion and she cooked took him the easy route. And she chose to keep me and. I don't know it's just. Just really sucks. So next one i'm going to Idaho to bury my mom on the property cuz cuz she's up there now. And i'm. My. By. i'm going to see my grandpa again and my uncle and my aunt is driving up to. To stay with us or while we're going to get an airbnb or whatever, but."
252.0,Provider,Sorry.
6080.0,Patient,"I just. And then, like my mom's best friend has been reaching out to me, which is quite annoying because I just don't like her, in general, like she. never really made a difference in my life, like, I tried staying with her a few times over the years. I tried staying with her back in. Like 2011 I was like right before I turned 41 years before I moved out to Santa Rosa. And I was staying with her for the summer. And like I had a job, like I had my shit together, I wasn't overweight, then like I. I was like really establishing myself and really trying to make myself better. And she's like Oh, I want to move back here and I was like I don't so i'm moving to Santa Rosa like. um. You know, and then a couple couple months after that she got her kids taken away and and all of that. and Then she's like talking to me like i'm my mom but i'm like dude I do not care about your life like i'm sorry like I don't care about like your marital status, like that is on you like. You know. and And then she said, well, I still don't get how your mom Kobe and I was like. She wasn't vaccinated. Well, according to my husband like you have to know somebody who has coded or you have to get sneezed on, and I was like you all are fucking dumb goodbye like like it's not. You knowing a person co bids on surfaces like it's an airborne allergen. Like if there are people around you, yes, that have coded you could get it, if you have a strong immune system, you might not get it. it's literally based on your health, whether or not you get it like. And she doesn't understand all of me dealing with the doctors every day for 13 days, because my mom was on the bed for 13 days. Before her before her work and started shooting know. And I had to make that decision because they were like she's not going to make it through the night, and I was like well, then we should take her off. And I had to watch. I don't want anyone to ever pull up paid effort is horrible I wouldn't wish it on anybody have. I don't care how about I hate somebody I would not wish it on my worst enemy. To go through that that is. That is a level of hurt I don't know if I ever get super easy like thankfully Luke was off of work at that time I came home. And my friends also were off of work and came over immediately after work like. Literally like Lou home from like work to come be with me and it was my two best red and blue. And i'm just watching my mom's will they stop breathing. And then drama happened, while I was on my trip through going through my mom stuff. So. That was a lot to deal with having having to take her off of it then going through all of my mom's stuff because, like leaving her house that's the last time I was going to be at her house like that was. It was all. So. I was in the car. Trying to look for flights back home. And they were really expensive they were like two $300 to fly back home because it was like a week in advance and like you know, like flights are more expensive if you're like a week out well i'm like I haven't flown in a very, very long time. So. i'm like well you know. Last week it was like $100 cheaper than it is this week, you know, like so I was like I should have bought the ticket last week, when I you know, have the chance, but like I didn't and like whatever. But i'm like sitting there and i'm talking to Luke because I had just spent $1,000 doing all of this, like, which is that thousand was supposed to go to Vegas I was supposed to go to Vegas for my little brother's 25th birthday in December. So, like I had I had it planned to convince my mom to go ahead and get the vaccine if she wanted to come with me to Las Vegas because I didn't want. Austin my other partner and I to be like infected and stuff like that if she wasn't. vaccinated so like I was going to convince my mom like hey. i'm here like let's go like I was, I was gonna surprise her like I was going to be like hey i'm here i'm downstairs. Or, I was going to call her when I got to Los Angeles, and be like hey there's a package at the door for you can you can you like bring it in like can you come down and pick it up and. i'm. I was going to be waiting for her to like come out and I was going to be like you have like the next like. Like our to go upstairs get close get your wheelchair and we're going to Vegas like I I was going to plan that. and I didn't get to, and so I there was a lot of like feelings, I was going through, as I was driving back to my house to drop off some to drop off my stuff because I was going to drop off, and then we were going to drive back to Idaho, and so I decided. Not to go. Which. was ultimately I wanted to be there for my grandpa like that's ultimately what I wanted to do but. With all of the decisions I had made before going through my mom stuff I need your time to grieve on my own I need to feel what I feel right now mentally. Before seeing a whole bunch of fake ass people because that's that's my family, they are super fake and they always hated my mom but yet at their funeral at the funeral they are like oh I love mom and I was like you hated my mom you hated by all like. I don't even know who you are, why are you here like you know they mean like. And so, and that was a whole show on itself but but no, so I I posted. I have had to make some really hard decisions over the last few weeks on I posted on my Facebook and I said but. I need. You all to realize that, like my decision to stay home is completely for my mental health um I will be flying back in November around thanksgiving ish um to bury my mom on our property and to have my own. Like my own funeral. and Then they were like. So. My uncle's wife has been calling him this whole week right like that we were. Together, like every like hour two hours she's like hey what are you doing, unlike we're going through ship woman like we're going through some shit. Like Fuck off like that's all I wanted to say, the whole fucking trip is Fuck off like just Fuck off. Like you will see your husband in a week like I was about to go three weeks without saying my husband, you can handle a fucking week without yours. But this bitch is like my 600 pound life and can't do anything for herself like she is legitimately my 600 pound like I know I am a big bitch I have owned my ship. But I take care of myself I wash myself but they've myself, I see myself I I close my eyes, like this bitch can't do any that she needs him to do everything for her wipe her ass basically and I just I had it Rebecca fucking had it so she calls. 2.5 seconds literally two seconds after I posted what I post again I had been crying in the car for three hours talking to my uncle talking to my grandpa. Making sure that if I made this decision, they then weren't mad at me because I need to know that if I don't go they're not mad at me yeah like because, like my grandpa is one of the only human beings in the whole world that I love some looks like him my my husband my brother. You know there's like a few people that I will fight the ends of the world. To be there for and so. Like he's like my dad like he he stepped into that parental role for me whether he knew that or not, or whether he knows that or not, but he became my dad when I don't really have parents so. I had made that decision and I fought so hard to make that decision. And so I sat there, and like I had posted that post and I was so kind about it like it was not an easy decision and so. My. aunt or whatever I wouldn't even consider her an aunt because she just married my uncle couple years ago so like I barely know this woman like they were together, less than a year before they got married it, you know what I mean it's not like I she grew up and. You know I barely know my uncle I only met my uncle when I was like 18 like legitimately like met him at 18 so it's like I barely know my uncle. So. um so she calls him and goes, why is an Anna coming I thought animals coming why isn't she coming, and I said it's frankly none of your fucking business why i'm coming. For one migrant my uncle couldn't hear her because he was driving his windows rolled down like his phone is like pretty much like cuz he drives a minivan and if you know anything about many bands like where he has his phone is pretty much like really close to like the staring. Like off the side to like the floor almost like it was on some stuff so like it's not like up to his ear or anything because we're in California, if you talk on your phone, you are going to get a ticket. um and he's trying not to get a ticket because his job is a job, where you have to drive. mm hmm so he's trying not to get a ticket but she's calling every hour and so she's calling I end up screaming at her and was like just mind your fucking business, it is none of your fucking business whether I come or not is none of your business. And I even asked in the post. In the post I said in so quite I said can my family, please understand or respect my decision Please respect my decision of not coming right now, not that i'm never coming, but I just don't want to come right now. And I said it so in the best way possible, I said it like before I even posted it, I was like I read read rewrite it like before I even sent it out and it was like, can you please respect my decision. And she literally like called and then her sister jumps in on my posts and said, well, some people just need to chill out. Let me pull up this post for you, because it is. It doesn't just stop there, it is D. She like. I, too, must have missed something or another, but. I said Okay, so this is the post I said. I have had to make really, really hard decisions over the last couple of weeks, but i've decided, I will be staying home and not going to the funeral for my mom. I just can't deal with the heartache and staying strong for others, I will have someone do a live or recorded for me, but I need to be alone right now I please ask any of my family to respect my decision of not going I do plan on coming in November. For thanksgiving and doing something really small with my Papa and Baring my mom on the property and getting her a headstone which Amazon has them for like 50 bucks but I don't know if I want to trust him."
252.0,Provider,"Now, or if you even get it from what I."
6080.0,Patient,"She goes some people need, and this is after I have yelled at her sister she goes some people need to chill the hell out. And I said, some people just need to mind their fucking business you better watch how you talk to me a little girl I won't put up with you talking to me like that or my sister. I said listen here i'm going to say this once and say this once one time only Fuck off and then his sister or his wife says let's stop this now, before I go into seizures I and then tamra which is my mom's like best run like they've known each other, since like. First grade comments. Can you please just leave animal alone and respect her decision, she is an adult and it is her choice losing your mother is very difficult and painful it is not. Your mom that just passed away and a better choice is to respond and in loving and caring way you being mouthy is not going to bring any peace out of this and she's not a little girl and then my cousin who like just attempted suicide posts. I think people just need to leave me alone, we are all adults. Sorry, my uncle was calling. um. We are all adults here. And our hold on, let me text them and just tell them. um we are all adults this side has already gone through to this and a suicide shut the hell up and find something better to do with your time. And I said, thank you and then my aunt goes, this is my niece that you're speaking to I suggest you speak with her doors with respect and and my my. My dad jumped in and said, you need to back off my daughter, a little a little girl, she was going through a rough time right now and show her some respect. yourself peace, one of my friends those your peace and well being is way more important. My best friend also posted your grown and you can make your own decisions, no, no, no one needs to try to tell you what to do, I love you I can't wait till thanksgiving data and then dory my. dad or my uncle's wife goes stop please adult need to have seizures the mind your own business, I didn't nothing to you, you are the one who screamed at me while I was talking to my husband and I said he can't hear and he told you, he can't hear you, for the umpteenth fucking time. And then she goes wasn't trying to cause a fight, but if it's if it comes down to not seeing my in laws i'm okay with that that's fine by me, Richard will leave you home that and then. Jennifer my aunt goes at this point, you do, you and stop calling every 10 minutes and then she goes fine, then my aunt who. I wanted to see and like again she just went through her daughter dying. I was worried that she would be mad at me for not going and stuff like that she's like no judgment here, I was like I was so worried that you would be upset, but I want to try to have you come up when we'll get a place and and you know Mike my other my cousin. said that they would help and then my uncle Bruce was like you might not remember me but, but this is decided the family that understands that pain data to die. And then my aunt or my cousin goes again it's very sad that these adults are out here. Creating drama on a post about someone's mom who just passed away I think people just need to shut up and sit down and remember this doesn't involve anybody. and grow up if you have an issue I would love to call to have a conversation regarding how childish, you are, and I was like thanks babes. I was like this is why we're like sisters. um cuz they're transitioning so like they're doing like very girl pronouns. So um but that's been difficult, on my end and I was like bro it's it's not that hard to like try changing he to her, or if that still makes you uncomfortable they is perfectly fine to. Like it's not I call everybody like dude or bro or she or he, like I I literally i'm a gender is like person like I will call my gay best friend like a sister like like girl like it's. it's it's weird I gender. small town minds are just so hard to change."
252.0,Provider,yeah.
6080.0,Patient,"And then my and goes, if anyone has a problem with the fact that Anna will not be there, the you can all come to me and confront me because I will be there, and you don't understand what it's like and then. This family can or this drama or the family, the drama to drum up is beyond ridiculous and I was like yes, it is, and then um man goes, and please don't forget to kiss my ass while i'm there and then. My uncle commented, and goes me dad and Anna have been had to go through all of my of my my all of my sister stuff and I have spent Tuesday through Friday with us and it's very hard for on all of us to see, I have pictures to show how much it was and um. You know, and then one of one of my friends go group, how you want to agree is not how this person or that person like Fuck people's feelings it's your feelings that matter, and then my uncle jumped in and was like duh duh this is her uncle and I was like that's not what she meant. She didn't meet like Fuck you she just said, like. Nobody should tell you how to grief and then. My aunt or my grandma commented and stuff like that, but like overall, it was just. It was a shit show, even during the funeral because. i'm trying to see cuz I know what time it is. It was even a shit show at the funeral because. It started two and a half hours late they wanted it out of Park, but then ended up having a my great grandmother my grandmother's house. And I was like. yo This is very ridiculous that like if I was there it's still be a shit show like it wouldn't have mattered if I was there, or not, because, like. They still just didn't know what they were doing and. I don't know. don't get me wrong, I really. I really wanted to be there, like I don't regret my decision of not going I really don't and like when I was talking to tamra one of like my moms like best run from like growing up. she's like I think you're going to regret the decision of not going, and I was like I don't think so because mom wouldn't want that. Like I knew what my mom wanted, and this wasn't what she wanted, because she knew half the family didn't like her, she knew that all of these people are fit. And there is no sympathy and you know what I mean so i'm. I. i'm getting two jars of of her cremation I bought four jars I bought one for my cousin Juno and then my grandma um but they're getting like half of half of it because they're like this big so they're only gonna get like half um because I want a majority of my mom could be buried. On the property and I already talked to my husband and I said. Well, wherever we are at when we finally like die if we want like a plot or something there or wherever we're at like I want have to be with you, but have to be on the property next my mom. And he is like oh you don't want to be buried next to me and I was like no that's not it I love you I do but. Like I want to be next my mom and my because my grandfather when he dies he's going to be buried there like when my uncle dies like. he's going to be buried there like."
252.0,Provider,Family land. makes sense that you would want half and half you know. And you do have to let everybody else you know you've got to do what's right for you.
6080.0,Patient,"I just don't understand how ugly my family can be like I just I owe them nothing that's where it baffles me I owe you nothing you. When we got taken away, and when I was eight none of the family scraped together figured out who would take See you in a knock no one in that family besides my aunt but my aunt had already had four kids she was about ready to go through a divorce, she was 22 years old. 22 years old, taking on six children, mind you. I would have never had a child, it would have been me and my oldest cousin you know which we're about. enos 26 miles or five years apart. And four years apart sorry. hang on hang on, I have to do math me and my aunt or 12 years apart me and INA or. She had enough at 16 so yeah we're four years apart sorry add to. That. But me, and you know would have ultimately been surrogate parents like we have taken on the role for the other four children. And I was eight at the time. Like you know was for like. It would have been. that's what I would have done, I like I would not have had a childhood and my aunt would swear like no I wouldn't have done that, and I was like no but that's who I was going to be, I was already taking care of Stephen when he was born at six years old, like. I have this book called. Which is a great recommendation for your group, I feel like it's called burn after after writing. I don't know if you. heard about it before or not, but it's it's a really good book and it's very eye opening and now it's like when did you feel like you first became an adult and I was like six. Six years old, because I took care of my brother, when my parents were out, and I was left at home by myself, like. And then again. When I got kicked out and was back in foster care like i've been an adult almost my entire life I don't have a childhood um. And it's, not that I regret any of my decisions or any of. I I wish that I had a childhood I wish that I could look back and be like because, like I here and it's so fucked up but I hear everybody else's childhood like whoa I wish I had that I wish I can say honestly that I had that and I don't and it hurt sometimes. But I wouldn't change it like I wouldn't because. I I wouldn't be as strong as I am, today I wouldn't be able to take on the challenges that I have now. I wouldn't fight so hard for me and so like. I am. I like I don't know if I told you, but I quit like the weight loss Program. um and they put me on these other people put me on this like weight loss drug supposedly i'm victoza it's supposed to help me lose weight, but. i'm not losing weight i'm not eating as much. It suppressed my appetite like it said it was supposed to. But I haven't been losing weight because of obviously all the stress. So it's like. I going to talk to them and tell them like if I don't see any really significant changes in the next two months, then I just want to get off of it. I want to be left alone, I want to get off my birth control, and I want to try, because life is honestly to short it really fucking is to be told that I can't have kids because. I have so many doctors in my corner, who are like Oh well, it's unhealthy i've seen. People like on my thousand pound sisters, or whatever have kids at the same way that i'm at. If they can have to do, why can I help. My mom Mr miss. it's quite painful."
252.0,Provider,I know.
6080.0,Patient,"and i'm not saying that i'm will get pregnant right away because i'm probably not because I have PC ios and I am overweight like. I am expected to probably have like a miscarriage and stuff like that, like, I know, but. i'm tired of waiting i've waited four years to have the stupid surgery and. None of them thought I was ready, even though I was at full weight several times and. I quit smoking and I started back up, and I know I know I know. But i'm going through some shit right now and it's better than me drinking or doing drugs or. Like any of the other stuff that I could do. Because my dad's an alcoholic I don't want to end up like my dad being an alcoholic so I started smoking, again I am slowly weaning back off. But. I have broken down. So I cry all the time. And it was."
252.0,Provider,very frustrating. It must be and listen no judgment here for smoking cigarettes i'm telling you right now. Okay.
6080.0,Patient,"I just feel bad because, like, I was so I was I had quit for like a year. But I didn't want to pick up a bottle because I knew I would I would put it out, I knew I wouldn't put it out. And like i've been really good about taking my The anti anxiety and not taking as much as I like I would have normally in a normal fucked up situation type of thing like an addictive personality would. Like I rationalize them i'm like Do I need it, can I fall asleep without it okay I can't fall asleep tonight, I will take some like i've been. that's, the only thing i've ever been addicted to cigarettes and sex, but you know teach. But that's due to trauma why i'm hyper sex, sexual eyes. But that's, the only thing i've ever been addicted to and i'm happy that i'm not addicted to drugs or alcohol or anything like that."
252.0,Provider,and you're going through a hard time.
6080.0,Patient,"It is so I do just. want to call her. And she's you all the person I was hooked you about all of it all of it. She saw it here. And i've gained 30 pounds. And the last like three months, like even before. My mom died, I was gaining weight again. i'm back at like 380. i've gained 10 pounds in a month. An adult he that's the thing like I eat like once a day which probably isn't healthy either, but. Like i'm not hungry like I. i've been barely sleep I barely."
252.0,Provider,yeah there's nothing there is absolutely nothing that I can say to change what's happening in your life right.
6080.0,Patient,"Now I know that, like I know. I know grief. I cuz I felt it with my sister, but it was not I don't think it was this bad because, like I didn't talk to my sister four years before she died. So I already like. had lost her. But like because I tried reaching out over the years, like, I tried trying to reconnect with her, but like because I said what I said about her dad.

So I will continue the family tradition and if my daughter doesn't want to use Rachel that's fine like I want to be bad, but for her to be named after the two women in my life that i've carried the most about like. i'm okay with that, like.
