ID,Role,Message
13861.0,Patient,hey are you Julie.
416.0,Provider,"i'm doing all right, how are you. Okay."
13861.0,Patient,I hear myself in your background. Okay.
416.0,Provider,"Still yeah. it's okay. it's not gonna bother. me it's just. Like Oh, do I."
13861.0,Patient,"hate the way we all sound I think that's a human thing like we don't like the way that we her own voice like offensive or something. funny. Why was I not able to join, I never found out."
416.0,Provider,"On Monday I never found out either, so we get these messages. Before group about like so and so needs to do this and that and this person has this issue and can't be in group or whatever, and we didn't get them we just got a. He needs to come back to the virtual clinic right away, we didn't get a reason why, and then you went back to virtual clinic and they didn't know why I don't know and i'm so sorry for that confusion it's really frustrating."
13861.0,Patient,"By chance to you know because I this month went from platinum to bronze on my health insurance, but i'm going to go back to platinum next month, just because all of a sudden my medical bills are like. I never knew how much I was saving with platinum. Does that impact what i'm paying when I see you guys, do you know."
416.0,Provider,"hey I don't I wish I could tell you the answer to that I have nothing to do with that, so I don't know and I don't. have access to the part of our system that shows me that so that would be a virtual clinic question. Sorry."
13861.0,Patient,"Your portal their portal is. useless like I was trying to figure out what I was being billed and it was all very vague and those people could not help me at all whatsoever, because i'm really detail oriented, and in order to know like what is being charged and when, and I just still don't know."
416.0,Provider,Okay.
13861.0,Patient,"And it matters because right now i'm on a tight budget, especially this month now, with like these medical bills that i've had in the last two weeks. Because i've had several doctors appointments for different things that, like all of a sudden i'm like shit what I don't know like Am I gonna make it money wise to the end of the month, so that's like why all this is so important to me."
416.0,Provider,"yeah yeah. yeah um. I don't know I mean I really that that virtual clinic folks are the best people to walk you through it. I wish I could help more I don't know, I wonder if there's place hold on, let me look at one thing. I can't see you for a second, while I look this up. Let me see. There might be one place, and I can lock but i've never even looked in this spot on our system. That it says individual therapy, you have a $15 copay group therapy a $7 and 50 cents."
13861.0,Patient,I get ice. As he 22 I pay 20 to 50 for.
416.0,Provider,"And then, it said collect 20 to 50 $15 for the doctor oh that's right because yeah the further group yeah."
13861.0,Patient,And that is regardless of whether i'm bronze or platinum.
416.0,Provider,"I that's according to whatever the insurances that we have in our system, so if it's changed it might have changed. And I don't know if you've updated that insurance information with us, but that's what the latest isn't in our system."
13861.0,Patient,"This is just a source of anxiety for me, which is a good segue into what we can talk about yeah like. anxiety is. I have i've never really understood what the term meant. But now that i'm getting a little bit better understanding as to what it means I look back and see like how its impacted my life in how I respond to things. wouldn't make other people upset but that make me upset you know, like insurance and budget stuff and. More so than probably is reasonable. You know I had a hard time. Like I failed the bar twice, and I think that's a big part of it, I just never realized, you know I studied my ass off and just couldn't pass it and never realized that there's an anxiety there's an element there that. Like it worked up and I just can't think. So. You know i'm going to add her own now and lithium and. I like the effects of both. But I don't see much change in my anxiety like I feel like my mood to harness volatile."
416.0,Provider,yeah that's the lithium.
13861.0,Patient,I can articulate myself better I think that's the adderall. But my. My depression is a little bit better. But my anxiety and my irritability is not and i'm wondering if adderall is pushing the irritability.
416.0,Provider,"It can for sure and that's a great discussion for you to have with it's buried right here with Mary. yeah. um but so it can it's possible the. The treatment for anxiety. While there are drugs that help with anxiety, a lot of times like an ssri um. But the. The treatment for anxiety is not drugs, ultimately, the treatment for anxiety is therapy it's it's behavioral changes it's thinking changes it's interrupting thoughts. And there's a whole book that actually Mary loves that I will share with you, since you are quite the studious man, let me grab it. yeah. And we can work in this actually, if you like, this is the anxiety and phobia workbook. it's by born it's that make sure you get the seventh edition. And it's it's quite good, and it has a lot of. Evidence based treatments for anxiety in here, it also just talks a little bit more about like what anxiety is and what it isn't right is it like in a in a evolutionary sense is a really functional thing for us right. tells us when we're in danger. anxiety when you're standing on the edge of a cliff still is right or when you have the bar to study for whatever it tells you that something's really important anxiety. When nothing is actually dangerous or super important is dysfunctional anxiety that's disordered anxiety and that's what we want to work on right, so the goal isn't to get rid of all anxiety because anxiety is useful, but the goal is to get rid of the disordered anxiety. So your brain for probably lots and lots of really good reasons is telling you that you're in danger for indicating to you that things are dangerous or scary or overly important when they're not. I see that yeah so it's that is disordered thinking and a lot of ways there's certainly a physical element to it but it's disordered thinking and there are ways to to work on correcting Those sort of pathways in our brain. What do you find like in terms of disordered anxiety what or can you describe to me a little more of what's going on right now with you what's been happening lately, when you say your anxieties been bad."
13861.0,Patient,"Help irritability. If I have to. Like I got a bill from ucsd yesterday for a session that I thought was free from two days ago. And I called up the billing people. And I had to I wanted to ask for the person who set up the schedule for the free session and I had to explain to the person why I needed to talk to the to the person who set up the original. Meeting. And I got here a little bit like I had to like. Think and properly structure, an explanation as to why I was calling up. And it's just it's like my day is one. sorts of sessions after another and then the weekends come and i'm alone and i'm so much better and i'm so much more productive work wise. Because I don't have like these episodes like I do during the week. Where I just have irritable moments. Where I fishing and it's like you said, like my brain is telling me this is important when it's not."
416.0,Provider,"Okay, so. Go ahead."
13861.0,Patient,"And another example is like when I have to deal with these care navigators because look Filipinos are lovely people, but they don't they're culturally not in tune with us and. Dealing like whenever they're in customer service it's it's there's some they have no discretion, they just have marching orders and they can't they can't digress from those marching orders and they just don't get it it's a cultural disconnect that irritates me."
416.0,Provider,"So a lot of it is around like you, having a need. And struggling to get that need met and a lot of those needs around money or logistics or paperwork and stuff like that."
13861.0,Patient,getting things done.
416.0,Provider,Anything that getting things done.
13861.0,Patient,prevents a an outcome.
416.0,Provider,"Okay right and then there's so. Using that as an example and what are the. If you can tell me a little bit about like what comes up for you in terms of thoughts when that's happening like what are your thoughts about yourself in the situation and speak freely, please, and then physically what's going on with you like, if you can describe that."
13861.0,Patient,"beard irritability I mean like anger is is you know, like, I feel like my. Blood like my health wise i'm in perfect shape like my blood raise my arm my blood pressure heart rate, everything is great my triglycerides are great, but I feel like I like would think if I had high blood pressure, I feel I feel like that's what high blood pressure would feel like. The sometimes what goes through my mind is. i'm on the I feel put on the spot, like, if I have to explain and that's that's why like. You know oftentimes like with the Filipinos like i'll say something say i'm the customer who always has questions that have never been asked before like i'm always like finding like the. Like Frequently Asked Questions are the bane of my existence, the lighting every once in a while in my in my room, because the lamp shade terms it's not the lighting it's just the way it appears."
416.0,Provider,that's kind of cool.
13861.0,Patient,"So. What goes through my mind, is, I feel put on the spot and like being like i'm being judged in that moment before I explain myself, because I asked questions that are like what is, what are you talking about like no one's ever asked that Like her, I feel like. I have to. show my worth i'm on the spot for that or."
416.0,Provider,Interesting okay.
13861.0,Patient,i'm gonna be judged negatively.
416.0,Provider,"Can we trace those feelings, do you are there other times when you get those feelings and sensations or have in your life can we trace them back somewhere else, I mean my my."
13861.0,Patient,"My father was negative with me my entire life and he was he he's my sole caregiver growing up. He was always negative, I mean he. he's the founder CEO of company that. So he was the boss, he was the boss, since he was 26 and I was met with a lot of criticism growing up."
416.0,Provider,"So your brain got the message somewhere along the line that everything you did to be heard, to be seen and to get a need met that you had to justify yourself, you had to explain yourself, you had to. Prove your worth in order to get even a minor. need met so that sounds true. Okay, so. Your brain developed a pattern response to that right, where anytime you're put in that position you're going to have a reaction to it. Right, which is why that sort of feeling of being alone on the weekends being at peace. Why, that is more comforting to you because your brain feels safer your brain feels like it can calm down."
13861.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
416.0,Provider,"yeah so the one of the ways that we treat anxiety is to sort of re pattern the brain around this and to work on having different reactions to the the situations that create the anxiety. So and there's An example of this that I stole from a therapist that I admire and. She talks about you know if I if i'm out in public or whatever, and I i'm afraid of dogs, I see a dog. And I see the dog coming kind of close to me and I run screaming in the opposite direction and I go and I hide out in my in my house and I, my brain what it's doing is going. Oh, my God, thank God, you went and ran away and you hit in your House that dog could have killed you now you're safe. Right, so what it just did in my brain Is it actually reinforced a pattern it actually made me more anxious to run away because my brain was is now like you could have died, thank God, you didn't right. So the opposite of that would be. Some exposure and being able to tolerate being in that situation, with a different reaction, but we do it usually in small doses. there's you might have heard of exposure therapy we do it in small doses so like if it were the dog, we would start out by thinking about the dog and tolerate thinking about the dog first. Imagine petting a dog right, and then we would maybe go to seeing a dog through a window for a little bit, and we would tolerate the discomfort of that, and each time we do that our brain goes ah actually we're Okay, we didn't die. right we didn't have to avoid this we're okay we're forging new pathways and then the next time you know, maybe we would. see a dog from far away and not move in your brain right so, then you get closer and closer and eventually you get to the point where you tolerate being in a room with a dog and even touching the dog and you teach your brain over and over with. This thing we. We call willingness right which is willingness to be uncomfortable its willingness to tolerate uncomfortable emotions. But it's not for no reason right because, like right now you're getting anxiety that's dysfunctional that's disordered. And that anxiety you're having to tolerate it, even though it's not actually helping you. This this experience that i'm proposing is. Tolerating discomfort that will benefit. Right, knowing that there is. That there's a positive effect on your brain when we do this."
13861.0,Patient,How do I expose myself to these phone calls.
416.0,Provider,"So it's a little different yeah. But I think for you, I mean you let's come up with ideas together we can. It doesn't have to just be my ideas on this, but we can think about how do we. How do we maybe when you're at your best when you are too stressed out so maybe like first thing in the morning, or something, how do you have a phone call like this and very consciously have a different reaction reaction to it."
13861.0,Patient,So you're you're saying. Like have these phone calls when i'm at my best.
416.0,Provider,"I have your habit like if i'm saying this is just one idea of how we might change your reactions to this a little bit right so like find a time when you are. When you have all your resources about you, you know you're not as tired you're not hungry you're not grumpy right. And and do a little obnoxious business then make the call to the hospital or to bright heart or whatever, and then we would plan out a different reaction we would plan out a way to remind your brain that this isn't the most annoying thing ever that that you are safe, that it is OK. We plan out some messaging and your brain yeah. We wouldn't want to do it when you're depleted, though. At least not to start."
13861.0,Patient,"You know what else I also think, in the middle of things like that is all these other things that I have to get done and i'm spending time explaining this and."
416.0,Provider,yeah all this messages so it's about changing arrow. Nobody wants your input on this harsh harsh sorry. Let me. Okay. Can you hear him.
13861.0,Patient,"No, can you can you hear yourself still."
416.0,Provider,yeah can you hear me.
13861.0,Patient,yeah I can I just was wondering if you still had to listen to your ECHO.
416.0,Provider,"Oh no, no, no, I can't hear my ECHO anymore. Now let me, let me just let him out so he doesn't start keep. Working go out. He knows, not to fully bark while i'm in session, but he just says this annoying thing, where you just that's for or. um. Okay, so. So it'll be about changing those messages right. You have a little cold pete."
13861.0,Patient,"No, I just have allergies, sometimes. Like first thing in the morning, my nose will run a little better."
416.0,Provider,So these thoughts about having to prove yourself having to justify your worth they see him based on our first conversation to to be really pervasive in your life.
13861.0,Patient,yeah.
416.0,Provider,Starting clearly originating with your dad. And then it came up pretty strongly with your your girlfriend to sounds like.
13861.0,Patient,"I mean I don't know about proven myself to her, but. it's kind of like the third straight relationship i've had extending over the last 11 years when first 75% of their relationship time wise. i've got all this potential i'm great on paper, but my potential is yet really to have become. fulfilled. and towards the end of the relationships it's kind of like you know where is everything that. Business them saying where's everything that I thought i'd get from you, you know you're such you get all this potential and. It never plays out like the Italian my X is native Italian I don't know that came up. Because like I said. I have been in and out of Italy, for the last five years, and had the last four Christmases were with her and her family, because I don't spend any time with my family. was in the first the first two Christmases with her family, it was like you know i'm the next great thing i'm going to be the Patriarch of the family. And then coven hit, and you know I the last couple of years i've been cycling through startups because that's like. sort of my lasting career ambition is to. be an early stage startup guy and then sell the company for a lot and then raise a family in that order. So the first two Christmases were great the last two were like what's wrong with this guy like this is is this ever going to happen because they saw me going in and out of startups and now i've been with one for like a year and a half a startup that's going well, but it's still stressful. It was like that. You know I no longer had that shine to me, and you know, whereas everybody wanted to take pictures with me the first two Christmases and the last two it's like he's still around. So, in that sense, like now, I want to prove to them my worth her and her family. I know she watches my instagram. But to my dad and, to be honest to myself at this point like."
416.0,Provider,I have something to prove.
13861.0,Patient,Just because I put in so much time working toward career success like I view it literally as my salvation like having this big exit from a startup I mean it's such a high. thing I have to meet to sell to like. feel good about myself so like hard. And it puts a lot of. pressure and to be honestly i've carried it i've carried that burden for the last 1520 years.
416.0,Provider,It seems like longer.
13861.0,Patient,"yeah I mean it's it's the longer I go because of some cost fallacy, I, like you know, like Where are you like putting so much time in something it becomes more and more valuable as the more time you put in. yeah now it's like I owe it to myself, like now it's like if I don't get this and all this years have been wasted and you know losing my girlfriend I could have had a regular job and taking care of her we'd still be together, but because i'm like pursuing this like so difficult thing. And the truth is, is that. If it's hidden to myself, my own anxiety or realization that I had anxiety I would always walk around thinking i'm just stressed, because i'm trying so hard at something so difficult that stress is normal, but this is like it's my anxiety it's."
416.0,Provider,Definitely it's also so. I wonder if you're aware of how strongly you are. You are stating and how strongly you seem to believe that. That your worth is almost entirely based on some potential outcome that involves money and success.
13861.0,Patient,"I mean a. lot of it is because I put so much time into building the resume. That. yeah it's like if I don't have the outcome, then I must really be worthless if I did all those things and I couldn't get the outcome."
416.0,Provider,And when you hear yourself say this does any part of your question that.
13861.0,Patient,5% of me.
416.0,Provider,"Okay, so this is a deeply held belief, for you, that success that you are not going to ever be a successful person unless you are able to achieve this very limited goal."
13861.0,Patient,yeah that's why I won't have a family and tell them. distracted.
416.0,Provider,So if you were to win the lottery tomorrow. And and have money and meet the love of your life and have a family that you want and live a happy life. But you never ever made were ever able to be successful. In this company would you still feel like a failure.
13861.0,Patient,"My deeply held beliefs wouldn't be as deeply held they would still be there, I would not at the at this point. I could have to losing my love Italy, I would not. Like if I won the lottery. I would do everything I could to. Either with her or someone else replicate what I had with her two or three years ago and start a family, like, I know that I want to found 49 so i'm getting old i'm not like I don't have all the time in the world to start, so I probably wouldn't just readjust I would still. I probably wouldn't be as hard driven, but I would put myself. In. Situations of high potential I wouldn't be as stressed out about being in those situations, but I would have to like feel like I still had a chance for that, like ultimate payoff for."
416.0,Provider,"Okay. So you are in a position where your definition of success is so contingent upon this very narrow goal. And it sounds like that success is also tied to like you're feeling you're feeling of success as a human but also like as a man. Right like you're not a real man, unless you can do this or something."
13861.0,Patient,"eyes, I don't view like this is my pathology that's how I view it."
416.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
13861.0,Patient,Look at other people and say why aren't you driven like me and if.
416.0,Provider,So why is it different for you than for other people. Why are you different than them.
13861.0,Patient,"Like grew up and I saw my dad do it, and my dad pulled me down. Most of my life. So I kind of have to like to prove him wrong type thing."
416.0,Provider,Why.
13861.0,Patient,"Because I felt for decades, this long standing. battle between me and him over who was right."
416.0,Provider,I see you've been at war you've been fighting your dad's war for many years right.
13861.0,Patient,i've been fighting a war with my dad I don't know.
416.0,Provider,"Well it's not one that you chose. You you've chosen to continue it yeah you've chosen not to withdraw, but you didn't start the war, you didn't you didn't choose it. You didn't choose to have these. These very narrow values for yourself or ideals or standards that was imposed upon you."
13861.0,Patient,The origins mean I think i've run with it.
416.0,Provider,I think you've run with it too yeah yeah I think you run with it too and it's important that you see that actually because it's a conscious decision to continue to be in a war with a man you don't talk to. And who you don't really want to talk to it sounds like.
13861.0,Patient,"me and the ironic thing is, is that I use his success. To my advantage professionally because my peers see my father success. and there's I think it puts me in a higher light in my peers."
416.0,Provider,"Yet for you yeah I mean I think it's about time he gave you. something good. Is perception yeah great. Great but that doesn't have I mean I think it's that's a bit disconnected from the idea that you are still in this war to prove yourself with your father who you don't even talk to. Right and you're holding yourself to that standard so when you think of success for yourself, it is narrowly this this thing right it's this this image right this like I my startup will be sold, and I will be all of these things, and my life will start then yeah. Right, so it is no wonder to me that you get annoyed when. things get in your way when you have to deal with paperwork when you have to deal with annoying bureaucracy there's no wonder. That that would really trigger you because anything that's going to be perceived by your brain, as in the way of that goal, or in a threat to that goal is going to feel very personally threatening to."
13861.0,Patient,My put my CEO says that I. Take things personally.
416.0,Provider,You do it is personal to.
13861.0,Patient,them that's what I feel like saying this is all personal.
416.0,Provider,"So. I remember this. kind of friend years and years and years ago. Who, I met we lived in New York after 911 and actually met him on September 12 and we've been friends, ever since he's married to a friend of mine now he was in MED school and I was in Grad school at the time and we met, we got along great. We and we got to be really close, for whatever reason, we just clicked. And he's one of the smartest man i've ever met. comes from like a. Lower middle class family I think that's even saying a stretch lower middle classes, a stretch for him. didn't wasn't raised with his parents, like all kinds of disadvantaged backgrounds and it's just this like low key guy who happens to be freaking brilliant and made it to Columbia MED school so he's in MED school and. He has a lot to prove is a lot to prove right because nobody thought he could do it, nobody ever thought he would amount to anything he's African American you know. And he's kicking ass he's just he's killing all the classes it's no problem and it gets to ironically, he gets to psychology. His his well not psychology psychiatry he gets into psychiatry class and he fails just just cannot understand the concepts just cannot get it through his head. And this brilliant man this friend of mine. Because he was failing that class even before he actually got the grade decided that he was a complete failure, and he ended up in a psych hospital. because all of his identity was wrapped up in that one thing. Everything that he was was wrapped up in the idea that he had to be successful. And so, one threatening thing to that one misstep. was so threatening that he couldn't tolerate it. I see a lot of that in you yeah. So i'm not going to ask you to change your values, because you clearly value this this goal of yours, and I think that's great I appreciate the goal, but I am going to invite you to be a little bit more flexible in your thinking for your own well being. and see if there's opportunities to be flexible in terms of like. What, what are the other elements. To success, what are the other elements to being a full real man to you. What are the other pieces that you want to achieve someday, I suspect, you might not have even thought about it too much because you're so focused on this one goal right."
13861.0,Patient,"I mean I. I know families in there, but I i've also told myself until i'm. financially secure. not raising children. I think that's a huge."
416.0,Provider,yeah.
13861.0,Patient,"And the the outcomes are so different with him without money that it's it's and if you're aware of those outcomes. And you don't have the money don't do it, maybe you can see the difference."
416.0,Provider,"So we can we can talk about that as much as you want, but. But i'm So let me ask you. Can you think of men in your life that you admire in different ways they don't all have to it doesn't all have to be wrapped up in one man who's just perfect, but like can you think of men that embody traits that you admire. Even women doesn't have to be just men."
13861.0,Patient,point blank. I mean I I can come up with a great list and the explanations but point blank. It doesn't mean they don't exist in my mind. it's very hard for me to pivot.
416.0,Provider,"that's okay. i'm not in a rush. i'm not trying to pivot, so much so just to connect it to for you."
13861.0,Patient,"Okay, I got."
416.0,Provider,Something. Now tell me.
13861.0,Patient,"Well, not not it doesn't have to be like a celebrity just because he's a celebrity but I like Tom Brady and. messy the soccer player, because their family guys with despite their and even though they're so successful but that they're you know good to their kids and they love their spouse. Like that's. Okay that's sort of like when when I have my career success that's sort of the litmus test lose people are the litmus tests, some of the you know they're just the celebrities that I can think off the top of my head. That, I want to be like that, like that's who I shoot for."
416.0,Provider,"Okay, so what i'm hearing in terms of traits that you admire, are you like I love the msc, by the way. Huge massive fan. Anyway, the. So it's. it's not necessary, the money is peripheral, but you like there and that they aren't distracted by other things from their love for their family and from making their fam family a priority, their partners wives and children. Right so they're dedicated parents dedicated husbands. Okay, and in in there somewhere it's like the qualities of actually dedicated time and effort not just providing materially, but like also just being really present with your kids and your partner. Okay, those are great traits right. So I want you to think about and this will be part of your homework, I want you to think about and write down actually. What it means to to be a great man. That doesn't involve the traits that are outside of being. outside of financial success."
13861.0,Patient,Okay.
416.0,Provider,Because we know that that's important We already know that that's on your list so what other traits. or any other qualities. That you admire. And that you want to be.
13861.0,Patient,"I can tell you that each of them will be. It would be required to have financial success for each of them in my mind like i'm going to say things like be a supportive parent. required with financial success. But okay. So instead of like mutually exclusive or independent of they will be conditioned upon financial success. Which is why I haven't given much thought to them, yet it's like it's in the back of my mind like that's on the back burner like that comes next. And my Italian next knows how I think about this."
416.0,Provider,"It sounds like she thinks about that a lot too right so. it's interesting that. You know, in a lot of ways you've manifest you manifested. You manifested your family again. Right, because you had this partner who. You fell in love with that you guys fell in love. Based on. The your relationship sounds like it was based on the ultimate goal, and if the ultimate goal was unreachable or not reached in an approved time frame, then it's done."
13861.0,Patient,"that's what happened. she's i'm 49 she's 28 so. She just. You know use kind of use that against me like you're an old man like it was not having happened by now, and it can happen, and she just turned into you know, I was hurt first love, so now she's like going through this period of. dating a lot and dating is the G rated version of word of what she's doing right now. mm hmm."
416.0,Provider,"So there was a hope on your end. on your side, what i'm hearing for this unconditional love right this like you're going to be with me through thick and thin and when I when I make it you're on board like here you are. and her. hers was more like i'll be with you for a while to see if you make it. And then i'm out."
13861.0,Patient,"She said things in the beginning, like I had her for life and. she'd never leave me and. Family was perfect and they love me. And then, it just got stale, especially with Coleman being apart for eight months 2020 mm hmm."
416.0,Provider,"yeah I mean things do happen in relationships and people grow apart, but there was the way you describe it, there was a condition from the beginning on this relationship."
13861.0,Patient,"Well, I mean I I was gonna be. You know. they're old school, you know, I was going to be the breadwinner which is fine by me take care of her. so that we could raise a family and yeah that was we talked about kids very early in the relationship after like four or five months. And you know her being as much younger, as she was to me gave me for me time for kids like. So it opened up a lot of it really opened up a lot of possibilities for me because I don't know if you remember, but my ex before her was seven years older than me and drank herself to death. Left, I left the relationship in 2015 and she died in 2019 we're still we're still close, but the relationship was over, but at you know I thought, when I was with her for four years that. I by being with her, it was giving up on my right to ever have kids and I was fine with that before alcoholism kicked in. So to chill yeah and Italy gave me the opportunity to have kids again in my eyes. And it gave me time because she was so young, so it was in her family was is beautiful like traditional have been together forever grandparents together forever traditional Italians and I loved it. blew up."
416.0,Provider,"So you both went into this relationship, and a lot of ways, looking for an outcome."
13861.0,Patient,Family yeah yeah.
416.0,Provider,So. Going back to the anxiety. Are you I mean is this conversation helping you understand kind of where it comes from a little more.
13861.0,Patient,yeah the war with my father.
416.0,Provider,"And with yourself. Right, so you, you are putting you have put so much pressure on yourself for this one outcome because in your mind the way that you have thought about your life and success and everything connected to it that this is there's only one path. And this, if this path doesn't happen, you are completely worthless."
13861.0,Patient,"i've told myself that I don't stop on this path until I get it. I don't I don't see I don't see like if it doesn't happen, I see if I fail, I try again until I succeed."
416.0,Provider,"I mean I I admire your determination and i'm in no way trying to dissuade you from this path, I think I think that's fantastic, the thing that concerns me about this and the thing that I think is. causing you a lot of suffering is that you aren't able to enjoy the path to the end right that there is for you success is not. In the journey that there is only one version of success and that you have to wait to get it, and if you are disciplined enough and steady enough, you will eventually get there, but you are not allowed any. You know you, you have to live like a monk, and you have to be. Essentially, suffering right there's no balance it's just like there is only this path, and there is no happiness in the meantime or joy it's. That will come, maybe. What happens if you get to that and there's no joy."
13861.0,Patient,I can't see a scenario where if I got that. career outcome that i've been working toward that I wouldn't be joyous just.
416.0,Provider,"know I think you would, I think you, you would feel joy, but I, in terms of like life happiness there's a belief that you have that all of these other things are going to fall into place once that happens."
13861.0,Patient,"person is the only. mistake or not like the source of non joy, or maybe. A tragedy and family and my family or something."
416.0,Provider,You know it's something that not being able to have a family or not meeting the right person. or even if you have all of those things not being able to enjoy them because you're still struggling with anxiety and depression.
13861.0,Patient,that's possible I say you know what I saw that I see that my dad my dad sold his company in 2008 and he retired for two years now he's back working again he was never he never really came out of his sort of depression like he's been. And he's the kind of person who won't go to. therapist to get treated. So I see that my dad.
416.0,Provider,"So. yeah I mean, these are real things. you're everything. Everything about your plan is about delaying. A life delaying happiness delaying life yeah. And I would hate to see you get to a place where you get what you think you want, or what you do want and you still don't find the happiness or the joy that you're looking for. So why not. expand your view of happiness and prepare for some of that now. Well, part of it is is rearranging your thinking a little bit, and again I i'm not trying in any way to dissuade you from this goal of yours, I admire it and i'm supportive of it, I actually think you have a better chance of achieving that goal if you are healthier and a little more. Stable in terms of your thinking. So part of it is finding some joy in the now. And starting to become the man, you want to be now not waiting. Right you've your version of success and manhood has been defined by. A man who's not very happy and who isn't part of your life anymore, and was never really the kind of Father that you want to be someday. So you're in a unique position to redefine that. Actually, in a lot of ways, a good place to be. it's an opportunity. to redefine what happiness and success look like as a father as a friend as a partner as a man. I have this conversation a lot with men, by the way, just so you feel like you're not alone and. Especially men in our injury age range. There were so many messages growing up about women and men in our generation i'm in the same generation as you and there were so many messages. about what a real man is and so many of them were really toxic and they were coming from men who were miserable they might embody that, but they were miserable people. Right, and yet we we drank them up, I got the same thing about messages about women what you can and can't do and who, you need to be, and all of that. And we spend a lot of time. When when we get older and healthier we spend time it's Okay, for us to question those and go okay. But i'm not okay with that anymore, what do I want to be. How do I want to walk through the world. giving you a lot to think about today on p. what's on your mind right now."
13861.0,Patient,Think about john Wayne.
416.0,Provider,"Oh yeah tell me i've seen every movie my dad's major john Wayne fan. Oh, of course, that's a classic yeah. i've seen all of them."
13861.0,Patient,When you're talking about the toxic.
416.0,Provider,Oh yeah.
13861.0,Patient,"needs to be a man, you know, like one thing that we don't talk about that I haven't brought up is that i'm short and. I click football at auburn has a block on, and I was never more. made aware of my height than there. For obvious reasons, but. I still I still. Think less of myself because of that. Like in social settings. And should shelia even said something about that toward the end of our relationship that she like taller men like she was kind of throwing it in my face. So there's a limit to how happy I can be. I don't think i'll ever get over my high you know my dad is my dad and my or my dad's 510 six one so i'm the run to the family, the men. took after my mother. I don't know what i'll ever be able to do about how I feel about that or if i'll ever be able to let it go, but you know when I. Actually view myself as a like a my mind i'm still that football player, even though I don't want like it like height wise. But I think about like. Toxic views of how we shouldn't be and I think of john Wayne and john Wayne was like over six feet tall, I think it was like six or six three. Like that's what a man has yeah pen pen because of him because of the fact that i'm sure I still get. vibes from people, or at least I interpret. When strangers interact with me like in. customer service settings like in person, getting i'm getting shafted getting the short end of the stick no pun intended. So I don't know what to do about that, like I can't do anything."
416.0,Provider,"Well, I think. There comes a point in our lives, where all of this stuff doesn't get resolved right it's not like i'm going to someday get over the fact that I have body imperfections that I can't that I don't like or you are not as tall, as you want to be. But there comes a point in our lives, and we hope to get to this point where. Where we just start to be so okay in our own skin that those things they're still there and they're still sore points, but they fade away they're not as. they're not as raw. But it's it's the bigger work that does that right, where you walk through the world confident that you're the person that you want to be. We first have to figure out who, that is. yeah in a wider sense."
13861.0,Patient,"I want to cash in and then disappear from the public view like. Like social media just gone and just focus on. Who, I meant like I I really like being a lot of really like being with CC Julia and sherry before I really like that feeling, it was like."
416.0,Provider,You like the partnership the companionship.
13861.0,Patient,yeah the companionship that's the word. And I. I want to find a companion and. raise a family with a companion in a financially secure environment.
416.0,Provider,"I want that for you, too, and I think you'll get it, I think that you are more likely to attract the companion, you really want to be with. When you are the best version of yourself."
13861.0,Patient,CC would say that to me like I need to work on myself. Question questioning their relationship and saying that I needed to work on me.
416.0,Provider,yeah. Oh. What was what happened. I don't mean that in I certainly don't want to remind you of a painful memory of CC saying that it's just a law of attraction right when we are. When we are on a healthy journey we attract other people who are unhealthy journeys. So pete what's your what's your homework this week and are you gonna are you feel like you're going to be able to do it is does it feel realistic to you.
13861.0,Patient,"yeah it's realistic, I mean what this week, so we meet again in two weeks, I think."
416.0,Provider,Two weeks yeah sorry yeah two weeks.
13861.0,Patient,"to write down trades outside of financial success that I admire what it means to be sort of a great man Kennedy actually I JFK is another person I admire a little less on that womanizing stuff but. yeah I really like. growing up. i've been looking i've been thinking like who influenced and i'll be fast, because I never coming through what. i've been thinking who's been influencing me like who influenced me in my youth that have like brought me to where I am and one was my headmaster one of my schools in baltimore and others Kennedy like just."
416.0,Provider,"Right. yep. that's your homework. Okay, and then to start I am you know if you're going to make the calls the frustrating calls. see if there are some you know some different ways to approach it try to do it when you're at your best not at your worst right, if possible, I know it's not always possible but see if you can and and just be aware of the thoughts that are in your head. Right, so if you find yourself like Why do I have to prove myself I don't have to justify myself or why are they judging me or. This is taking up time that is valuable and that I should have been using for other things, or whatever it is right, whatever those things are see if you can find some counter statements, because, even if those thoughts are true. Even if you are having to justify yourself the thought itself isn't actually helping you calm down or get through the call."
13861.0,Patient,The thought of itself is or is not.
416.0,Provider,"is not helping right it's just causing you anxiety. So sometimes for me, sometimes when I like can't when I have a thought come up that's really negative and I can't convince myself it's not true. Even though it probably is not true, but when I can't convince myself of that i'll just be like who cares if it's true it's not helping me calm down right now. Right it's not helpful i'm gonna let it go it's not helpful i'm going to breathe."
13861.0,Patient,it's not that important that's another thing you said. My brain is telling me it is but i'm pushing back saying is not that important.
416.0,Provider,yeah finding a little flexibility. Right That was my version of a backbend did you see that that was my flexibility. Case you're wondering why all the sudden just.
13861.0,Patient,As my brain works.
416.0,Provider,"Alright, so we're set for next appointment yes. alrighty hang in there."
13861.0,Patient,"All right, thank you."
