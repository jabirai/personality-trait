4233.0,Patient,"I feel my normal, so I like it feels great for reals I thought that was never going to happen. Whenever I was in that mindset and then that I thought, like, I thought, like what is wrong with me, it was just like Oh, what is wrong with me but that's still something I do want to. I can't wait to see the prime care doctor, so I could really see to see really what that was that was very weird. very weird."
99.0,Provider,"I mean I don't know how this sounds to you, but I think something we identified was it was it seemed like it was anxiety."
4233.0,Patient,"yeah but then I don't really know I don't know if it was a heady that costed or because what's weird but I noticed that. Whenever I get show like that I had it was like when I will take an ibuprofen it would go away. It would make it go away like I had a headache or I don't know it was weird like and then another thing that I noticed, too, is, I had a block spa like a spider bite and looked like. Because it was on my hip and then was there for like four months straight, or like five months straight, it was like a big black bar and look like a spider bite. And they didn't want to go away for four months and that's when all this started happening to when I have that and then. Finally, it started going getting smaller and smaller and it took like two months for it to completely go away, so I don't know what that was either so and and. I don't know I just I just feel like if I want to get checked right, you know, to make sure my head, you know. Fine, because I feel I feel like I might suffer from like some kind of migraine. or or or migraines or like a headache or a migraine or something, because I i'm it's weird how Sometimes I get a headache or a migraine I do, I feel it hurts them and. And then it fills the document that it shows like in my head count process something like process, you know I don't get anxiety, then, but it feels just like I just get that feeling that account process even even. Even if i'm like watching a video or something you know it feels like a movie or something or video just so that you can process it and then it, but if I take an ibuprofen it goes away in. The head, it goes away and it's gone and that's it. So I just wanted to check on that."
99.0,Provider,"For sure, well, it sounds like some inflammation because i'd be profaned probably hoping that you know."
4233.0,Patient,"yeah oh yeah I see so that's one thing that's weird but definitely though Dominique I do want to personally think you thought thought. venting and crying and and netting all that out was something I need it. need it and but, as you see, after I did that that's when I started really recovering for row i'm so glad I well, I mean."
99.0,Provider,"You know, sometimes we don't we don't even have to know exactly what it is, but things from the past they just need to come to the present to be felt. And then created into our current self and then we're okay it's like it's just sometimes some things need to come, they need to get like unstuck her on frozen."

4233.0,Patient,"um. How can I ask ask it. let's see if. I could ask you to explain i'll just ask to explain the calling i'm feeling. Okay, so let's see. Okay, so please explain the calling on feeling i'm hearing from nature. explain the calling i'm hearing to be out in nature. Please explain the colleen I am hearing. To be out in nature. By the way. So pretty I love them. All work on them."
99.0,Provider,i'm excited to see. see it when you do it.
4233.0,Patient,"let's see um. So I did get. I got. A while actually before, let me just see what I get from him and then i'll explain the cards. um let's see. Oh. Oh, I think Okay, I think it's saying that I it's telling me to get ready for success and like it's telling me to like. I need to I should be out in the physical like you know the nature is it's telling me I need to to be out on I need to get ready to be the King of pinnacles. it's like mentally spiritually and just. Get myself prepared prepared for it because. The King of tentacles. Is success, and you have it all you've made it this this King has everything he wants there's everything, and he has it all um. So i'm getting that. um I need to prepare for it that's what i'm hearing in my head i'm hearing, I need to prepare for it and I need to get ready for it because it's gonna be. it's gonna be a lot of energy, a model where we are a lot of on not worry, in a sense of like anxiety, but like a lot of all like it's going to be so new to me and so. it's going to be so new and like so much that i'm going to need to get ready for it like you don't prepare for it that's what this one is. What welcome nine have one do you see all the ones behind this person and he's just worried, or like he's just looking like, but he has all the ones you know behind him, you know he's doing good. You know that's a lot of work and he just looks like how you know, like so i'm getting that that I need to just I guess Maybe this could be my to go outside and connecting and maybe maybe this will help figure out. Who I am because I got the Queen of pentacle. The Queen of tentacles is very motherly very nurturing the Queen of tentacles is very secure like she's very secure and. see that she even has nature around her she's very in nature she's very nature is stick she i'm looking at the picture, she has the bonnie she has like a plan around her though trees on she's in every tarot deck usually the. The cleanup tentacles is very nature she's always around very plants and trees and she's very nature she's like Mother Nature pretty much um. So let's see I got the fourth one, so the main energy is happiness celebration celebration. For the fourth one is celebrations weddings happiness home happiness happiness in the home. But i'm getting with me. i'm getting. Oh that's what it is the thankfulness see i'm getting i'm that to give back or like to do to celebrate to celebrate and give positive energy back on just take not just get get and and give back so whenever I made it a kingdom tentacles to give back. and getting. celebrate and to get ready for it and to give on to be able to give positive energy backwards physical. fact like isn't you know how someone you know help people or something and that's what I want to do."
99.0,Provider,"So that's like that, with your computers and."
4233.0,Patient,helping people with their.
99.0,Provider,Leaders yeah.
4233.0,Patient,"Oh yeah even that yup and even healthy when computers and everything else so it's like that's what I wanted to because I truly believe that i'm watching what you give and what you get you should get back so I, I do believe that if I ever make it in life. in some way I. that's something I want to do is to give back oh oh and. i'm um. But to answer the question was for the calling is that is for me to just so like I thought about calling for nature, specifically so um so I could get in tune with myself. um. And the physical. The physical around me i'm getting I can tune with the physical around me and and I guess it's more has been on getting ready for for. How can I explain it the physical. That is going to come to me like on. How can I explain it like. I need to get ready for. For pretty much everything that's going to come to me like you know i'm gonna have i'm going to get everything and receive everything if I worked hard, of course, to the kingdom tentacles and worked hard for it. And just. I guess the message is for me to prepare myself prepare myself. To get back."
99.0,Provider,And it sounds to like just you know quieting yourself as you connect with the natural world is part of that.
4233.0,Patient,"yeah yes quite young and see, they just like I said is on. it's true, and this is what I wanted you to as I, you know I do want to practice more on spiritual. practices in my life, yes, is to to just connect. And, and I felt like if I just want to connect with myself my higher self to nature and and give back as well. And it's true i've been doing it i've been doing this in like Japan i've been connecting with nature and even the universe, especially with my tarot cards and i've been. i've been asking to give me, you know strength to give me i've been asking to give me um i've been asking to give me. courage you know and motivation to do this stuff and it has, as you see. I have been I have been thought I did always would promise that I would give back. If I make it. I would always tries to always promised that I would give I would help and give back if I feed it."
99.0,Provider,sounds like it's time to start doing that.
4233.0,Patient,"yeah. So while this reading is good, though, because I see that I made it while i'm seeing it i'm seeing that i'm going to be actually in the pantry i'm going to become successful and i'm going to be able to give us the cleanest testicle that the outcome. is very nurturing and helping and. And and it's telling me to not worry to just prepare for it."
99.0,Provider,mm hmm.
4233.0,Patient,"So, and when I say to parents more as myself, my mental self might. My of my physical sounds like you said doing does it keep myself healthy because if i'm sick or or if i'm not feeling good or something how am I supposed to do it, you know I can do it, so I guess I need to really prepare myself physically mentally on. And yeah and I felt like if I need to give my I just got a new message I feel like, if I have to give myself celebration because well as in as in whenever I do or accomplish something I feel like I should celebrate it I don't know why I just heard that message now so."
99.0,Provider,It should say.
4233.0,Patient,"I feel like if I need to give myself celebrations more because these accomplishments i've had I usually don't I just tell my boyfriend know I got this i've done this and. But I don't I haven't really celebrated it, you know I haven't really truly celebrated in like hot my friends come over and have like you know i'm. something you know just celebrate it, you know just something but yeah I."
99.0,Provider,"want to make that one more goal, and maybe the next kind of major accomplishment or goal that you've been wanting to reach that you actually celebrate yourself afterwards."
4233.0,Patient,yeah we will okay.
99.0,Provider,Okay let's make that the school. yeah you made in your words.
4233.0,Patient,"Okay, so. i'm not Okay, so not from now on every big goal not little every big goal, as in the next like if I reach 100,000 followers and then 200,000 and then like a million like that big goal or and not even just followers and even i'm. i'm like. Money wise as well financed what wise every time I make a big leap, I want to celebrate it and not only that, but. helping out as well once once this is after the finances once after the finances. Once i'd make enough to be able to help out, I want to celebrate that as well, but from now on is just going to be big goals from that from today on big goal i'm going to celebrate it."
99.0,Provider,What will the celebration look like like just.
4233.0,Patient,"let's just get it would be. It would just be like that doing the tone or having my friends come over to you and, like you know a little toast or something. hey are my song on you know, maybe get a cake or do something just a little celebration not too crazy. know just my friends come over and just acknowledged out. Where i'm at I guess."

99.0,Provider,yeah perfect awesome. Great guys so much came out of this reading for you.
4233.0,Patient,"Oh yeah wow did and. It made me very happy because I see myself, I see myself, making it I do the King of tentacles is the card you want, if you want like success he's the one that made it. is a success."
99.0,Provider,"uh huh. Well you're doing, I mean you have. you've made all the goals we've spoken of you've made it so. You keep you keep kind of upping the ante of what you want, but you, you are you already made you made it to what you wanted from our last meeting so."

99.0,Provider,"Okay, with Ellen."
4233.0,Patient,"Is all five of swords. Oh sorry Oh, it looks. yeah five of swords means cheating, it means. It means doing anything to get what you want. huh doing anything cheating to doing anything to get what you want it means see how this person has resources in the people in the bathroom like sad. yeah he's holding all the swords that he cheated them. To get all of these you know, like he won by he didn't do it in a good way so i'm getting that it's a warning for me i'm getting that arm, I need to. Stay truthful and. Clear headed and don't let no one or anyone on persuade me to do something like in a bad way to get somewhere, you know and that could be anyone not just it could be advertisers or something, you know that might want me to do something. Not good or something and they'll be like well we'll pay you a bunch if you do it, you know so it's telling me to stay truthful and to to not on not cheat in any way not. Not any kind of cheat."

Are our on our ways for our ways for you to learn and to and to improve on your style you know it's not it's not telling you negative messages. To be mean or like you know to scare you it's not when when negative messages come out on tarot cards is to tell you to to learn it's it's warning you if. it's letting you know you know, this is what you need to do to to to to be better or to improve your life. You know, this is what you're doing wrong, this is what yeah so I never fear negative cards and my tarot reading. But yeah."
