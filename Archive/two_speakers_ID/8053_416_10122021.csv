ID,Role,Message
8053.0,Patient,So sorry.
416.0,Provider,"that's all right, how are ya."
8053.0,Patient,Good I was putting things away and i'm like where's my drink. And so I have to run back to the garage real quick and then run back.
416.0,Provider,y'all. busy already. yeah.
8053.0,Patient,it's been.
416.0,Provider,How have you been.
8053.0,Patient,"overworked. very, very overworked. We ended up with cockroach like I found one of the main ones. That are like the bad. Like calling exterminator and. I killed that one, we do have gaps in our doors and whatnot leading to the outside so it's not uncommon for us to find like a water bug."
416.0,Provider,mm hmm.
8053.0,Patient,"um but I don't do well with cockroaches at all, like, I will chase them around with a hammer."
416.0,Provider,I mean anybody.
8053.0,Patient,"Apparently, my mom she manages an apartment complex and she's had a question this lady it like. Multiple she's like they're not that bad. And my moms like dude."
416.0,Provider,I got that.
8053.0,Patient,So. yeah one I was already kind of like. And then I was folding laundry on the bed there was one on my fucking bed.
416.0,Provider,Oh yeah I lose my mind.
8053.0,Patient,"I lost my shit, and so I spent. An entire night and an entire day. perimeter spraying the interior of the House and going around with gap filler installing the door sweeps. It was so much work, I was in so much pain, at the end of it. And yeah it was it was very frustrating. So I ended up like. Getting on everybody because uh. I felt. upset like really resentful because I warn them of this for this exact reason, this is why I wanted to really pick up after themselves and not leave food everywhere hmm."
416.0,Provider,So there was a lot of no.
8053.0,Patient,problem. Luckily.
416.0,Provider,i'm glad.
8053.0,Patient,yeah.
416.0,Provider,it's fitted you get the did you have to get an. exterminator into.
8053.0,Patient,"So far, we haven't had to our next door neighbor actually works for Clark pest control, so we can just talk to her and then she can set us up if we need anything we're going to need to our fifth year is coming up soon for our perimeter very or treatment for the termites. hmm so we'll probably try and funnel that. and see what to do, for there but. A lot of bullshit going on with that and then. I can't remember which chicken death, we were at last time we had two babies die. And then we had. yeah we had a third one go little baby baby one so i'm."
416.0,Provider,not going to do those How are they dying.
8053.0,Patient,i'm thinking that it's a stress thing with the kids.
416.0,Provider,hmm.
8053.0,Patient,"And because we were doing just fine Ruby is fine, I think if she acclimated better to the kids, then the littlest one did but yeah it was really, really screwed up. Because like. We thought it was a respiratory infection. But then they would just kind of like get weaker weaker and then. I think it was more they weren't eating. Whatever the case was, but it was bad yeah so I was very upset so I have been like a Hawk with Ruby."
416.0,Provider,So how many do you have now.
8053.0,Patient,Just the one chick.
416.0,Provider,Oh just Ruby.
8053.0,Patient,"yeah and so, in order to combat the loneliness we all take turns or at least between josh and I we take turns pedaling with her and just talking to her and then she sleeps in the room, with zach. So she gets that little socialization from him."
416.0,Provider,"He sleeps in the room, with."
8053.0,Patient,yeah well I bought a big tupperware. And drill holes in it cut the like squares often the top and then put a plastic bird netting. And so that's her little thing and I don't like the heat lamp bulbs. But we have this radiant heat it's like a chicken warmer. And we just put that in there. No that's been. doing good for keeping our warm and everything and and also worried about Zoe or blake being too rough.
416.0,Provider,yeah. yeah. How how have things been going on at the kids.
8053.0,Patient,"i'm a. Little iffy there's a lot of zach trying to play, both sides again. But. he's bypassing what we've put in place to catch him. So, like. Word whatever his question is a specific way and it seems non threatening and so we'll just answer turns out one of us has asked him to do something. And then he's. trying to get like a different answer out of somebody else he's mainly just fighting josh a lot. Especially with going to school."
416.0,Provider,Is he still refusing.
8053.0,Patient,that's blake blake is actually been doing better.
416.0,Provider,Okay okay.
8053.0,Patient,"I had been noticing that it was more of a time thing with blake like not having enough time to get ready same thing was that they need at least an hour. So. Interesting it's it's funny like if it's just sack you can get them up get them ready within 30 minutes eating breakfast everything off to school, no problem. hmm, but when they get around each other it's like just a recipe for distraction. So. it's just trying to get josh to. figure that out. When he's handling them just so he's not. Doing his anxiety thing and domino going on everybody else. hmm so."
416.0,Provider,"So, now that you figured that out. Is he going to school, an hour. and stay in school. Oh wow."
8053.0,Patient,"So, like today, he walked in no problem grabbed his breakfast went right in."
416.0,Provider,Can I put you on hold for one second I just got a text message from my fiance saying that there's a fire by our House and we've been evacuated before so just one second.
8053.0,Patient,"No worries make sure, yes."
416.0,Provider,"sorry about that I don't see anything obvious, so we must be okay."
8053.0,Patient,worst case like if it's too close to your House in your house in order.
416.0,Provider,"yeah we've I mean our House backs up to open space and like literally looking out over, and I can see, I was in session one day. My my kids know, like the only reason you interrupt me is blood like massive amounts of it flooding or fire and one day lexi knocks on the door he goes mommy. remember how you said, and it was a fire and it was bad I was like voice get your stuff back now the fire was like maybe 20 feet from our House. Oh, really. yeah it was really bad I could i'm looking out over the scorched round, right now, it was really scary."
8053.0,Patient,frightening huh.
416.0,Provider,yeah so so i'm a little oversensitive.
8053.0,Patient,"What am you not at all, we had a fun stay with us because they got it back you would have from lake port. During the whole like lake port fire a couple years ago."
416.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
8053.0,Patient,We had them with us so it's. Nuts how fast everything goes up.
416.0,Provider,"yeah it is it's scary. yeah Okay, so are you guys still doing your the couples therapy."
8053.0,Patient,yeah we had ours yesterday um. I don't.
416.0,Provider,necessarily like.
8053.0,Patient,"The way, like the one previous to yesterday's. It just kind of made me feel like. it's the same thing that happens every time with josh were like the pity josh and go well he's a man and he can't do these things, so you should take this off his plate, and it kind of ticked me off. But this time we actually worked on making a schedule. that's what our homework was last week or. Two weeks ago, was to. come up with the schedule. We sat down to try and do it. He ended up just kind of going right off topic we couldn't get anywhere. So I ended up bringing out my old one. Which is the same way, I wanted to do it anyways and just brought that to the meeting. And then we went over like a very, very simplified. Just her asking us what we want, on it and then dividing it into daily weekly, monthly."
416.0,Provider,and
8053.0,Patient,90% of the suggestions will mine.
416.0,Provider,"And that is josh agreeable to them, I mean."
8053.0,Patient,"he's that's the thing like he can be agreeable at the time and almost to a fault like you can be overly optimistic, but then it comes down to it, and he just falls right off."
416.0,Provider,And she was like explaining you're not feeling that confident that. it's gonna.
8053.0,Patient,"i'm always trying not to show it but, honestly it's always a waiting for the other shoe to drop thing with him because he can manage something for about two weeks before he caves and then it's just like a reversal. So."
416.0,Provider,yeah I hear that.
8053.0,Patient,are difficult for him to keep up with anything like that.
416.0,Provider,mm hmm. yeah yeah I hear that loud and clear. So um but how is your fighting and your relationship how has that been going.
8053.0,Patient,"I really haven't been fighting him it's actually been rather funny. How it tends to go that i've like been noticing, is he will start asking questions. What are these yes or no, or he's just looking for confirmation of what he's worried about. or. He knows he's wrong and he's already on the defensive. Like the other day I was just in pain, you know after doing everything, and I was watering the garden he comes out he's like are you mad at me or like are you upset and I was like i'm tired of being tired and i'm tired of having to do everything. And he started turning around to where it was all about him and defending themselves in this and that. We get to a point where I asked him like do you even remember. What we were talking about like how it started what I said to you because you took what I said. and turned it into you and it didn't matter what I said. He didn't care. He had already created this scenario in his head was running within it didn't matter if I explained it differently. And he couldn't even tell me what it began with. And he was like."
416.0,Provider,Oh interesting.
8053.0,Patient,"he's like well what was it, I was like i'm not going to tell you, and he goes. Well, you probably don't even know, and I was like there you go with the manipulating i'm like you're trying that's nice try, I was like i'm not going to start by you, oh my God. It was absolutely ridiculous with him."
416.0,Provider,And you guys are bringing this back up to your therapist when this stuff comes up right.
8053.0,Patient,"We didn't get a chance to she. We may end up changing because she tends to ramble or. It just. We have to be careful about what we first bring up otherwise she just like that's the topic um. But yeah we didn't get to bring. That up, specifically, the only thing i'd have to bring up was like when she wanted. us to do, like a set time for doing a task likes an hour for tidying up. I brought up a concern of. being accused of being neurotic or controlling. With doing that, which is what has happened in the past, and that was a fear of mine. And I wanted you know, to bring up that fear, so that we would be addressed so that we could move forward take thing."
416.0,Provider,yeah.
8053.0,Patient,So that's as far as I got to bring anything up on that.
416.0,Provider,"I see okay. well. Okay, but so so how is this impacting you have your how have you been coping with all of this."
8053.0,Patient,um it. pretty much distancing.
416.0,Provider,So you're withdrawing.
8053.0,Patient,"pretty much at this point because, like the stress that i'm feeling it's boiling over and I don't want to yell or scream. And it's like as soon as he keeps taking my emotions and he even told the therapist that my emotions are his like, however, I feel he goes that direction, so if i'm upset about anything he thinks it's about him automatically and then just starts going on defensive gets in a bad mood. And it just makes it worse yeah."
416.0,Provider,So he's saying that he's like kind of an empath so he's really just absorbing whatever you've got going on.
8053.0,Patient,Not even an empath um because he's incapable of like. he's more apathetic when it comes to emotions than empathetic. He almost acts like he doesn't understand them. But it's like he's constantly on a proactive defensive streak. Like he's just it's an impending doom thing for him for someone to be upset with him.
416.0,Provider,"So, but then does it work better, when you withdraw like is everybody happier or i'm confused."
8053.0,Patient,Much like if I don't interact with him. And I haven't like shown anything beforehand. it's good.
416.0,Provider,But then does it just sort of feel like your roommates or do you are you How does that.
8053.0,Patient,"it's felt like that, for a long time. Like I don't feel that he truly even looks at situations he's more looking out for himself, because there was a day I was up for a long time, and I was doing a lot of work just trying to catch up on things just trying to keep the mess under control and. I finally go to bed he woke me up multiple times throughout the night trying to have sex. On her next day i'm like exhausted i'm upset about that I feel like crap. And i'm like dude i'm like Why would you do this. he's like well, I thought night. i'm like so didn't make a difference to you that i've been at this amount of time that i'm in a severe on a pain my back is really bad and you're trying to have sex with me. When you can't even have sex as it is. Like he's."
416.0,Provider,Pretty mean he can't have sex as it is.
8053.0,Patient,"he's got ED bad like. He had or tell this dysfunction issues. When we first got together. But it wasn't nearly as bad and now because he's gained so much weight. Nothing, and even if it didn't work he his stomach is so big it's in the way so. that's What irritates me it's like. I almost feel like a toy to him at that point."
416.0,Provider,What is keeping you two together at this point.
8053.0,Patient,"Oh, things will work, I mean we have times, where we do work really well together. And where we actually laugh and enjoy each other. But it's like when the tough things come in, or the uncharted waters, especially for him. He won't follow, and he fights everything. And it just there's a lot of friction between like parenting our kids or managing a household. So it's. that's where we always go arrived, but anytime else we used to just. hang out talk. To this other bullshit with each other work on things."
416.0,Provider,"So there's a lot of like a lot of nostalgia there right there's a lot of these like really good memories and you guys are hoping to get be able to get back there, but was that, before you had kids yeah."
8053.0,Patient,it's great to go. down after it like it was still there after zach was born. But that's where that shift happened. Oh.
416.0,Provider,So a lot of it is the stress of parents.
8053.0,Patient,"yeah. I think it's just a parenting and adulthood, especially for him because it's like. He told me more than once, and that I coerce them into having kids are I forced him into it. and Trust me I know the argument there."
416.0,Provider,wow.
8053.0,Patient,"So that's one ridiculous. Excuse he's given me and then he said he wasn't ready to grow up yet and i'm like where he and all of this, so you're telling me now. Was the communication back then. And he goes well, I got two cats instead in hopes of deterring that and i'm like. So."
416.0,Provider,You can instead of kids really.
8053.0,Patient,He does this like.
416.0,Provider,it's funny because he laughed but that's like I was really interesting take things.
8053.0,Patient,"This is the thing that cracks me up is those comments that he makes their knee jerk reactions their knee jerk Defense excuses because zach will do the same thing, where he'll say like that he's done something. That is not Okay, and all like as soon as he hears that it's a negative he's like i'm just kidding. And we know he's not. And so we have to like go through that but josh is like he's you know older is on more time to perfect that crap so it's been harder to kind of like put it together, but now it's like i'm looking back and i'm like oh my God like. This that instant Defense. doesn't even make sense and he's just like yeah. Even like remember half the time what he said. Oh."
416.0,Provider,that's interesting mm hmm. Okay. So that. So how have your thoughts been.
8053.0,Patient,A lot of desperation. lot of like just wanting to give up type thing. can act on it won't act on it. I just. I need him to give me a goddamn break.
416.0,Provider,What do you hold on to when you feel that desperate.
8053.0,Patient,I go through the facts like if. If I were to be gone my kids would be left with him and his mother. To raise things and I know josh isn't going to happen next fine to stand up for his kids docs not gonna have anybody in this Court. And Sue is incredibly controlling and I don't want all three of my kids ending up like her to adult sons. You know. I want. To be over my kids your kids.
416.0,Provider,it's the wellness of your kids that really you hold on to. And then tell me about parenting your kids like is part of I mean do you enjoy being a parent like is that something that you hold on. hold on to.
8053.0,Patient,"I enjoy being a parent. I do not enjoy I used to, I do not enjoy. Setting up for parenting the cleanup the fighting it's just it's become so much for so long. That it's just so unappetizing I don't even cook anymore. And I love to cook."
416.0,Provider,What do you guys do cook.
8053.0,Patient,"we've been doing it like i'm talking about cooking like pots and pans and stuff like we can put things together cold wise but we've been doing a lot of freezer food, a lot of. they've been doing fast food drives me nuts. But yeah crap like that, at least for the past like three months it's been like that, before that I was cooking I was making homemade bread homemade pizza pizza dough. Just. Your regular things that we typically like to make, but as soon as like coven hit I would take about six months and it just started to really get old. and difficult. very, very good."
416.0,Provider,yeah too much of a fight.
8053.0,Patient,"yeah it's so much of a struggle, because it's like say josh will cook something on the stove. How he splatters grease everywhere, but I mean the whole stove the floor. covered in Greece, and he just leave it. So. A lot of frustration there he's doing better now he is like taking a lot, but like today, he left it there for a bit, and then I heard him go in and he took it needs sprayed it with the dawn got it soaking. And that's all i've asked like when they're done if they can just like scrape the dishes or rinser dishes out. I don't mind doing the dishes so. yeah."
416.0,Provider,"I think last time didn't We talk a little bit at that and. I just want to remember, did we talk a little bit about getting help."
8053.0,Patient,"Yes, I did bring that up to him about doing the housekeeping. um. I was thinking like twice a month just for like a deep reset at first he didn't really understand because he was like. It didn't make sense to him type thing and then I explained it again he he was like like merry maids and i'm like yeah like merry maids. And so. we're fine with that and i'm already aware that we would have to wait a certain amount of time to you know build up with a getting our payments and stuff on track before doing anything like that. it's just there's all."
416.0,Provider,His josh been working more.
8053.0,Patient,"He did like a side job for my cousin and then he's doing another side job tomorrow he's supposed to be looking for work. hopefully soon he's not he's starting to slip with the calendars. So that's. going to be interesting i'm probably gonna have to do some reminding. i've already posted I printed out a calendar I posted it out his eye level I put like our appointments on there, he double booked and tried to triple booked today. He booked his appointment for 1030 with his therapist and then i'm at 1045 with you and then he was trying to take blake to the dentist."
416.0,Provider,Oh yeah that doesn't work.
8053.0,Patient,He forgot to cancel the dentist appointment this morning.
416.0,Provider,oops.
8053.0,Patient,So.
416.0,Provider,And then josh josh has invented dental work that's coming up right.
8053.0,Patient,"I think so, and then he just had, because they did a bone graft. and I don't know if it was like a portion of it, or like an access but it actually popped out. So i'm it was an open socket meaning they had pulled the tooth and then immediately poured in what i'm thinking is bovine powdered move on phone because that's one of the cheapest ones that they do. For that, but I think that his body rejected it, and so they're gonna have to. Do something."
416.0,Provider,wow. I felt awful. You guys have a lot going on.
8053.0,Patient,"Always i'm trying to like. Always push to that point that tipping point where i'm like Aha I can get ahead and it just like it has been one thing after the other, it was like the chicks time and then we've got the cockroaches and then we have oh yeah one of our other minis disappeared. Yesterday, I could not find enough meaning what."
416.0,Provider,MIT oh.
8053.0,Patient,"She disappeared, I assume, dead, I was so depressed yesterday, like I sat in the chair all day long."
416.0,Provider,didn't know.
8053.0,Patient,yeah and then the little shit. I hear flapping and it's like you can hear that it's going downwards and i'm like no frickin way. Come outside and she's over by the tree eating and i'm like really i'm like I drove around the block.
416.0,Provider,looking for.
8053.0,Patient,"came I thought you blew off in the wind, it was off. But she went broody again so she's been hiding somewhere."
416.0,Provider,"Oh, my gosh okay yeah."
8053.0,Patient,"So that was a good thing, but it's like it feels like one freaking thing after the other, and it's like just trying to catch up. And this is how a shark lives yeah I don't know how somebody can live with, just like hitting you in the face."
416.0,Provider,Productive there's a lot about that that me it causes you a lot of anxiety. And so you're left in a position to um to just cope right because you can't control that that's how he and your children kind of operate.
8053.0,Patient,"yeah so I pretty much it has given me a lot of resilience. And that's like my optimism, for it is like, there is a lesson. But it's definitely it's hard, because you have to in that like split second I can go Okay, I can either get overwhelmed or let's look at this real quick and go, what can I control."
416.0,Provider,Or what can I do you know.
8053.0,Patient,"Your moments, and then I kind of like I have lists and notes that I take every freakin day. Just reminders and just. I guess tetris it. The best I can. So."
416.0,Provider,"I mean if for you, the key word and it, you know the mantra really is flexibility because control has control and. structure has brought order and safety into your life for a really long time. And you are married to someone who. can't do control and structure, probably thrives when he has it but can't do it himself. And you have kids who also can do it, so you are kind of at the mercy of all of that. yeah, and so the name of the game for you ends up being flexibility because. You can't you can't fix that."
8053.0,Patient,yeah.
416.0,Provider,you'll never be able to fix that.
8053.0,Patient,"You know it's something that he's gonna have to really want to learn and it's something i've explained to him, like a bazillion times because it goes well i'm making these changes, for you and i'm like. Like don't do it for me i'm like doing for you like these things that you know. are a problem in your life learning the skills is going to help you everywhere, like it's not just with me it's not. You know this weird expectation that i'm expecting them to be. Completely fit and eating clean and this and that. it's communicating. You know and yeah he's he's not he needs the structure. He just can't put it in place it just all."
416.0,Provider,"yeah well, and when you put it in place for him, it becomes a power struggle."
8053.0,Patient,"yeah but i've had to like alter that over time and it's taken so long and i've explained it the same way, each time tory's finally getting it that. These are suggestions and if you have something that you don't like about it let's talk and we'll find out put something in that does work, you know so. that's a party always forgets this that. bring it up and let's fix it. So."
416.0,Provider,"Right so that's your attempt to have flexibility yeah. yeah yeah but flexibility costs you to some extent to right it's tough for you, just like being structured and organized is tough for him because flexibility feels safe, I mean i'm structure feel safe for you yeah. Where do you think if you can trace that back to your childhood, the structure. I mean, probably some of it is your temperament but where does that super strong need for structure come from."
8053.0,Patient,"I think it's just from the fact that I moved around so much. When like I went to 11 different schools. And I actually developed a system for it. Because it was pretty much like a pattern, and it was like every two years, you know off we go. So I."
416.0,Provider,developed a system for it yep.
8053.0,Patient,yep I hated packing I hated moving I developed like I only kept a certain amount of stuff. And would pare it down to where it was really easy to pack up and I wasn't like I was you know man you'd asked my parents and they'd be like big never lose her because she'd have a trail behind her of things. That like I did not learn how to like. Fully clean and really like put the thought into it and the effort into it until I was pregnant with zach. So. Before that I was a wreck.
416.0,Provider,yeah.
8053.0,Patient,But I have my own little organized chaos.
416.0,Provider,"Okay, so for you this evolved really naturally from a way of responding to all of the moves and what felt like some chaos in your life."
8053.0,Patient,yeah.
416.0,Provider,"So to you this is how you respond, is how you know how to respond to that sort of CAS. yeah make sense."
8053.0,Patient,"it's like when you know someone else doesn't say when you're kidding like the foundations, not being set up for you it's kind of like just build your own. Type thing my dad definitely instilled a lot of hyper independence, which is good, but a bad thing."
416.0,Provider,yeah exactly.
8053.0,Patient,So it's got a lot of trouble.
416.0,Provider,Tell me more about that.
8053.0,Patient,"Just the cost, like the costs that you were just talking about for the flexibility. that's something i've been trying to teach josh is like when he doesn't do it it's still has to be done, and if I say, have to put something else off to do that, then i'm kind of behind, and if it continues on so for for me my dad told me don't depend on anyone. And I get where he got it from he's been screwed over a lot i've been screwed over a lot and taken advantage of. But the hyper independence of doing everything yourself has its own costs because you can like what i'm doing now and trying to get out of is running myself down to the bone. And then having to deal with the side effects of that. and trying to catch up."
416.0,Provider,yeah.
8053.0,Patient,So.
416.0,Provider,"Well, and also It also strikes me that, because you are so independent and so competent. of anyone who is in a partnership with you, it would be really easy for them to feel kind of useless."
8053.0,Patient,he's gotten mad at me for just carrying groceries.
416.0,Provider,yeah.
8053.0,Patient,i've had to alter things with him like i'll take the light stuff and i'll be like here you take the heavy stuff.
416.0,Provider,So you've been able to be flexible in some of those ways.
8053.0,Patient,yeah I don't have a problem with that my whole thing is not even thinking about like oh i'm more independent than you it's just like I don't want to make two trips to the car to get all the groceries out. So all load everything and just like Hulk it in. And then he kind of like reinforces my independence by not doing things. Oh. cuz he's always the type ever since I met him he'd sit there and let everyone else do this stuff for them. Now family get together he's on the couch on the phone.
416.0,Provider,"mm hmm. yeah which is probably one of the reasons you guys ended up together right it's because he was looking for someone to. To do a lot for him, but from everything that you've told me about him it's sort of a conflict within him right is that he wants to be really recognized as like a man, and you know, be seen as really competent and strong. And yet. And yet, he also doesn't really know how to do that."
8053.0,Patient,yeah and that's.
416.0,Provider,married. He married a woman who excels in that.
8053.0,Patient,"Because like what I told them is. In order for him to be even perceived as strong he does need to learn to be vulnerable to. that's a strength in men like i've seen my dad cry before only very few times. But that right there it's kind of rare. You know, to see a man be fully in touch and fully comfortable with all of their emotions and his dad. was a piece of shit."
416.0,Provider,And is a complex dad not around anymore you've never I don't think you've told me about his dad.
8053.0,Patient,"His dad is a piece of crap. He cheated on to so many times and Sue stuck with them, and he even had a kid with another person and had brought josh with him. And while he went to go have sex with a woman in the room, he had josh watching his half brother who he never knew was his half brother until later on in life."
416.0,Provider,here. And ugly.
8053.0,Patient,he's just skis and he is known by the city and he's got a photo company and it's a piece of crap it's basically a money pit. So.
416.0,Provider,"he's not around anymore, he did he die."
8053.0,Patient,"No, no, he had left sue for another woman. Okay, so he left her and they divorced and. I kept the kids away, I was like God not you're not going to use my kids to your advantage because that's what he's do."
416.0,Provider,mm hmm.
8053.0,Patient,"If it'll get him. recognized or oh you're such great you know grandfather doesn't that my kids are not going to be raised like that and raised around somebody who's just going to be like a revolving door. Like just in and out of their lives, I wanted stability. And he's had my number hasn't changed, and I said, like do you want to see your grandkids you talk to me about it. And what he did was he complained to his parents who then turned around and tried to pressure josh and me."
416.0,Provider,To which josh so.
8053.0,Patient,"he's 30 caving, and so I had to step in and re explain everything to them. and hold our ground on that."
416.0,Provider,"Oh wow yeah okay. So josh did not have an example of a. of a strong male figure, it was there anyone else in his life that did step in and provide that for him."
8053.0,Patient,His uncle Troy. Who is the pastor that married for both of us his. aunt Helen and uncle Troy amazing. They. And when they use Ministry.
416.0,Provider,And I.
8053.0,Patient,"Just kind of leave. bless you and i'm not incredibly religious or anything if at all. But I thoroughly enjoy talking to them anytime I do they're very calm very understanding they do. couples therapy as well, and so we have called on them a couple times it's just they live, all the way down in La so it's kind of. view and. Far between having conversations plus they have their own kids. And then my dad. My dad grew up in a family, yes, it was rough there was a lot of them, but. They adopted, like all the kids in the neighborhood type thing, like their house was always open, and so my dad's been amazing. And with josh and I can't get them to stop talking. When they get around. You know."
416.0,Provider,Did they like talk like it was just josh go to your dad when he needs.
8053.0,Patient,"He does for little things but, like my dad got him the T bar job that he does he got him into acoustical and. So, like josh would calling them about laying a certain type of grid or angles whatnot, and so they kind of like go on that. There have been times, where they've had little personal talks. But I haven't gone in depth. You know I want to josh and dad to have that. But my dad P with anytime. Like day or night if josh called and needed to talk about something my dad would be like what's up. and be ready for it so."
416.0,Provider,"he's. He sounds like a good, I mean it's nice it's I wish josh would have had that earlier in his life."
8053.0,Patient,would have been bad.
416.0,Provider,yeah his own Doug and and then he also has this sort of image of a mother who kind of puts up with Alice.
8053.0,Patient,"mm hmm. And she still does and like she does pretty much everything as soon as they whine. she's like coming to the rescue and then yelling at them, the whole time and. It doesn't teach them anything like she didn't want to take brett's josh his brother who's my age, she didn't want to take his gaming systems away because she didn't want to hear him crying to her about it. And Brett has. High functioning. autism asperger's and. he's not been supported or at all. So."
416.0,Provider,she's an incredibly passive. person and then.
8053.0,Patient,you're controlling.
416.0,Provider,Oh she's like a mix of.
8053.0,Patient,yeah she's a hoarder. Like she boards like.
416.0,Provider,Interesting yeah.
8053.0,Patient,it's not true. it's all nice but yeah.
416.0,Provider,"Well, I mean you can see right when we look at it like this, we can see kind of the dynamic between you and josh and all of this and how it all sort of mix this together."
8053.0,Patient,"looks like he's coming from the super control that needing to be told what to do, it's almost like she's made it into this codependent relationship, because she also doesn't want to be alone. Especially with the betrayals that she's felt. And so he's developed that sense of. i'm not he's the passive responsible and i'm the active responsible one. until he wants to be told everything to do and i'm like but you're you've got it."
416.0,Provider,"But he doesn't. But he doesn't right, because then he refers to you as overly controlling and all of that."
8053.0,Patient,"yeah that's where it gets so confusing to me is i'm like you need this, but you. damn me for. This. It was very hard to put up with, and it was completely maddening before I actually like really understood it. Now that I understand it, I see that it's not. it's not josh really it's it's a symptom of Carl. I take all that and I put it in the curl and that's how I treat it and it makes it much easier to work with them. versus thinking that that's his stance just. Completely it's more of like an anxiety response for him."
416.0,Provider,"interesting. yeah. So. we're almost out of time, are we scheduled for our next session yeah. To be chuck for you."
8053.0,Patient,Because we yeah it was the 12th and then the 26. And I think it was.
