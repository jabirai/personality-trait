Alright, so we're going to do the additional testing, you know, and if you're doing a lot of talent not it's going to be a lot on the liver. So now, if anything, comes up positive hepatitis C i've had patients get that cleared in two months, so I don't want you to lose hope Okay, because I see on your face you're less stress and they do have different treatments for help, be to kind of keep it under control. I don't know definitively about the health because we don't have all the testing i'm gonna get you want to get you to the specialist but your primary care doctor would do that, and then the additional testing will confirm about to help see. If help see as positive, you know they've got medicines that you may only have to take for two weeks that can clear the virus. really use a lot of hope will help see so you know i've heard people say does that medicine make you real sick. not like it used to do and interferon interferon was the one that used to make people really sick now you have different options and most of my patients who have gotten tree to have not been sick.
