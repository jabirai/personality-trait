2015.0,Patient,"Oh no. I don't know I mean. The House is coming along. The kitchen is getting started with because this is a duplex we're moving in. So the whole duplex needed. A makeover it was my granddad had people on drugs living in a house and a tour to house up, we had to have electric put all through the House, we had to get new pipes all through the House. um. No House need to be paying it. had to be exterminated because it was Roach infested. But it has come a long way it looks really, really good. So far, the bathrooms still need to be done in the kitchen because I didn't have no kitchen at all, it was no cabinets, it was nothing in a kitchen, but the beer room."
207.0,Provider,This is where you're a cool live right.
2015.0,Patient,"is one of my granddad rental property. So much a drug people tearing up the House. i'm hoping. What then two more weeks i'm hoping it to be done i'm hoping. I hope it'd be done in a week. But i'm trying to be realistic, so."
207.0,Provider,What else what other things are somewhat frustrating.
2015.0,Patient,My mom she next about every thing. that's why I chose to stay in the basement.
207.0,Provider,"But it was like that, when you were in other."
2015.0,Patient,You say what now use a little delayed on yet.
207.0,Provider,"Now I said it wasn't like that, at the other place when you are living in the other way."
2015.0,Patient,"Well, the difference was we was a duplex. She stated."
207.0,Provider,So now everybody even everybody faith and faith. yeah.
2015.0,Patient,"She complained about our water bill. I started to say. Was that oh house, you are paying the water bill at all our water bill had got up to almost $5,000. Because the people, she saw was selling the House to. um they were complaining they didn't want to pay the water bill. Jen pay taxes on how she had to go borrow money from my granddad to get the taxes paid on House so she could sell it. So she owed him 4000 so you have a novena. You complain about your water bill already you just moved here. Only wash. We did me here two weeks i'll even watch one time and I tried to do it when she got here. complain about my daughter Washington much and artists crap. i'm here. i'm so over her own guru."
207.0,Provider,"But do you think, do you think that a lot of your pressure and. Even with your side of the reality of the current situation at hand the circumstances. Do you think that you're just a little bit more annoyed with her because of your circumstances outside of that is. The relationship between your mom is different."
2015.0,Patient,"yeah um. I think last time oh. Things will be better. Because when I moved I don't know when she'll hear from me again. I love my mom of eating wrong, but I need some time away from her alone time. I don't know when. The next time. She was here for me when I leave. Well i'm being honest."
207.0,Provider,"But again, does. That come from just because of the current circumstance, in the last few months that she's just been a little bit more overbearing or is it hard for you to deal with."
2015.0,Patient,or when you're when it comes down.
207.0,Provider,To the relationship with you and your mom it's just always been stirring.
2015.0,Patient,"um. I think. I held resentment against her for a long time because i'm. She was it really the mother, she was supposed to be when I was growing up, because she was all she was a drug addict slash alcohol. alcoholic and she'd been clean for. 30 years now. Yes, i've been about seven years now and. My dad got custody of me when I was. eight or nine. And he was on drugs Austin. He wasn't an alcoholic or drug addict and. um. But he made sure I had a roof over my head I Clean Clothes I have food. After that yeah he might have spent the rest his. Money on drugs but. He made sure. I was taking care of. He did out he went out and did whatever he had to do. To make sure. You know, I was going to school, I went to school in elementary I remember one year I missed 33 days of school. 33. And I didn't get on on a roll. Until I moved with my dad. And then we moved Arizona he got off drugs and he was off drugs for the last five years of his life before he passed away, and then I had to move back to Michigan to stay with her at the age of 50. By the end, she was playing but."
207.0,Provider,I didn't take away.
2015.0,Patient,Hello me. Was you know she's one addiction to another. She went from being an alcoholic drug addict to a gambler. And it's just like she do don't think stuff. She still got that don't think fatality. So.
207.0,Provider,"So you still on. Like you said you still have a lot of resentment from the years of for not being there for her not teaching you what it is to be a lady coming up in this world. You believe that she chose whether the life of addiction, or whatever it is that she chose over you. where you are only don't."
2015.0,Patient,"blame her for getting molested. I blame her, for you know for."
207.0,Provider,You while you were living where you're living with your dad.
2015.0,Patient,know with her.
207.0,Provider,And look at a family friend.
2015.0,Patient,"It was a couple people one was my great uncle which is my grandmother's brother. Well, he didn't he he Let me take that back. He used to make sexual comments and. i'm trying to touch, but he didn't he didn't succeed. At. I will say he was inappropriate. Now the one who did. It was a lady who stay down the street part of our system they was from Mississippi. and It was just them to when I first metal, so I would go down near get my hair done she treated me like her daughter, you know that was like the only mother kind of mother figure I had, and she ended up getting an older boy free why she was she met a college. He molested. and The first person I told was the secretary at school. Because you know, sometimes my mother was never around the golf the days, weeks. Nobody knew where she was there. You know my grandmother try, you know graze most rubbishy glue. You know, but we was left at home to fend for ourselves. So I will go, you know, trying to find somewhere, I can go get some food, you know not be at home alone. At 567 I shouldn't have been at home alone. You know my sister she had friends that she would go over the House my brother. About. talking to her."
207.0,Provider,"know your mom about all of it, how you found with how you felt."
2015.0,Patient,"I remember telling her they choose to beat us was digit chords and she said she told me now she never beat us with us to check or a snake yeah yeah that's one that's one of the reasons why my dad. because she beat me so bad, the stitcher court had cut into my skin. And the social worker no chocolate services came out but they was asked me questions right in front of her so I didn't I didn't sign, then I just sat there. And so my dad took her to court, she didn't show up at court to even fight for me. Any. time I was getting some security checks come up and she was taken by chick come up say bye bye mama you got to go to work. Come on, come on come on Come on, you got key. Oh okay good clean the car up come on. This. alright. i'm tried talking to her, she just I think some stuff she don't remember you know how alcoholics they'll blackout, but I know some of this stuff she got to remember. You know she's. telling me my face she never what you would essentially Courtney look at her like really yummy sometimes she's to come in. and beat the hell out of us. Maybe if the House wasn't clean or I just like shoes to take out stuff on us that. She was going through. she's still are closed, like my uncle had bought me some brand new fields, this was an eighth when fields, without just came out cost an arm and a leg, and people are me and my sister some feelers she got the where hurts my mama stole mine. As a kid you not I make you feel when you are ready don't have nothing we are ready to have anything we have a Clean Clothes. roaches are no full. Why. You know. A lot of fit in in have a different media coming in now. I see that. He is are smarter than what you think. I remember, I remember stuff when I was three years old, I can still remember some stuff I can still remember. and here. i'm. And I think. I don't think I totally forgiven her. You know I just."
207.0,Provider,"Tell me so so. When you talk about, and when you really kind of reflect on your past with your mom and just some of the maybe resentment or anger, or whatever, when you look at today and kind of her. nitpicking at everything and just kind of her disposition in absence of the substances and her addiction in absence of all of that, when you look at just some of the. Her contributions, even though, yes, you guys may live together or live in close proximity of each other, do you think just kind of how she comes at you, and how she treats certain things and just kind of housekeeping mistakes, just to remind you. Of the passion that you have with her."
2015.0,Patient,yeah.
207.0,Provider,She. Does she has a strong opinion on you as a mother. toward your children or does she even.
2015.0,Patient,"say things match the tree my daughter. And I think this is why my daughter um. do some of the things she do she has always been able my daughter and went over my authority when raising. Raising her so therefore. My my daughter has never had to be responsible, shares and 17 I moved out on my own with the daughter that was under one and May. I never looked back. I bought my first House I. have my own, I never came back home. Until now, you know um. But. my daughter has she lived on her own one time, a month and last, the apartment because our management. She worked at Lear which they make parts, the GM. To make almost $15,000. To get paid every week, but she don't have no money that winner next check before next head coach she's broke barley. Yes, she gave me money for babysitting because I could be out here doing something else, making. More money which you give me but. She don't have discernment for people um you know, like to. Watch her you know, to find a babysitter. So I keep the kids because i'm scared. And I guess, because what I went through as a kid I don't want nobody to touch it now. For going through what I went through the molested you know. So that's another reason why I will rather keep them, but now i'm at the point where. my daughter is not appreciative of what I do. You know, a scout a new boyfriend and she's putting them before her all down, he is and I don't like. This it's like I."
207.0,Provider,"feel like that your. Your mom it has replaced to you because she wasn't there for you, when you were growing up, she tries. To parent vicariously through your daughter."
2015.0,Patient,yeah.
207.0,Provider,Do you.
2015.0,Patient,mean and she. also talks about me. To my daughter.
207.0,Provider,So it raises so it's hard for you to heal emotionally or just move from that the past trauma or her. For her absence or neglect or abandonment emotionally and mentally it's hard for you to move past that when you see the dynamic and do you think that your daughter uses a lot of it to her advantage or her benefit when she desired.
2015.0,Patient,yeah most definitely most definitely.
207.0,Provider,"You know it. But you know, this is a thing in keeping things into perspective. Because of right now everything that's going on is somewhat circumstantial circumstantial errors situational. situational one the sense of the living in you, you already been frustrated with the fact that your House is not ready, and all the money that got to be poured into it and your limitations within your funds and just kind of. Everything that's going on from a financial standpoint from being displaced and all events, and so, when because of your frustration, where that's concerned. i'm your mom is not helping the situation and because your mom is not when we're already in a place in our disposition is that i'm already added agitated. Already just upset overall over here, I want to get my business off the ground, I want to do all of this because you're already agitated over here. it's like now are our frustration everything gets displaced and so mom comes with her son your daughter comes with herself and the fact that, yes, even though we've made an arrangement that I want to help with the babies, but because i'm already display some already frustrated, you know. He hey listen if i'm already agreed. For one for three days. don't go ask me for a fourth day, even if it's. Over time, I don't care about the overtime because it's like everything is going to be in a boat and so you don't necessarily know how to tell it to categorize it you don't know how to say hey listen. You know so right now frustration is just flying all over the place and basically your your frustration is just being displaced on everybody. Sometimes the babies will catch it too because i'm already frustrated so then it makes you go back to the past, a lot and reflect on the past for lunch, and is it valid right now, not really. And the reason why it's not valid, because if you're supposed to bring all of that up everybody's going to look at you like what you're talking about simply because. The root of my current frustration is the fact that i'm displaces the fact that i'm on a standstill interpreting that all of these things are currently going on, and until that settles down. If you having to come to a place that, not to say that the issues with your mom or your your daughter or everybody else it's not it's not valid, but the thing is it's not valid right now. Not right now, because me trying to work through all of this past issues. it's not going to get anywhere, simply because i'm. what's going on with me right now is technically a moment."
2015.0,Patient,yeah.
207.0,Provider,"Because I. feel i'm homeless, but i'm not. And the but i'm not part is that all y'all to dragging your feet you're taking forever i'm paying you money you're coming up with all kinds of stuff and so it's coming to a place of prioritizing and organizing and saying hey. i'm not going to take you on mom and i'm not going to take you on to your kids hey i'm going to. i'm going to Center myself and my only point of focus right now is I need to get out of here and get my own place. When it comes down to mom is saying i'm only going to deal with you at a certain time of the day, a certain hour of the day, and I will not give you any more of it. Because if I do, then what is really going to come up out of me what is going to my system yeah it's not gonna be nice. So the truth of the matter is when it comes down to mom and your daughter i'm only going to give you a certain time in the day, a certain hours of the day, and no more. I love my grandkids, but I can only deal with them up until a certain time. does say that I don't love everyone and I don't want to be there for everyone, but right now, Nicole nice to be here from Nicole and Nicole needs to focus on her current goal. and her current goal is perfect, I need to get into my own place in my own space and once i'm able to do that and i'm settled with that, then I could be which all because this is. Even though, yes, I mean people of color yes we love the street here, but the streets here is ultimately damaging, but I think, in addition to you put them over here to your here the stress of life and everything is also eating to what's going on. With your and other and other physiological and other things that's going to display something even wonder what's going on it's because you're so overwhelmed and you're so annoyed and you're so stressed."
2015.0,Patient,yeah.
207.0,Provider,"And so it really is really organizing and saying hey. In order for me to be in full control of what I need to do this is what I have to do, I have to put everything in their category. From if you say from 10 to five or 10 to three or 10 to four is when i'm going to do with my grandkids, this is what i'm going to deal with them. And so, this is a time that you give your daughter with your mom i'm only going to deal with you, maybe in the morning, or in the afternoon but i'm only going to do it, and after that time has passed my alarm clock goes off i'm done with you. Because you have to be able to manage your own mental and emotional health."
2015.0,Patient,"Now. I don't i'm at a point now where I don't I don't want to babysit no more. I supposed to be living my best life right now. My kids are grown I raised my kids. with very little hill. Okay, so i've tried telling her if she had the first one, I told her before she had the first. I tried to explain some things how life was don't change. I try to tell her don't have no board. not really trying to get married first try to get your House and. You know don't do what I did try to be better than me. I want my kids to be better than me my son is doing awesome got its own place uh he got him a girlfriend guiding my job got money saved up he got good credit. I am very, very proud of, who I am but my."
207.0,Provider,"goal, would you. Ask yourself. which you have to ask yourself, are you in the place of your mother, enabling a lot of those behaviors, not to say you don't want to be there for your grandchildren you don't want to help your daughter when she's struggling. But at the same time, if she also feels that you running your mouth, but at the end of the day, you're still going to take the kids and you're still going to help her out. she's always going to revert back to pay whatever because you said, even though you run your mouth you're still gonna be here for me so sometimes we have to take a step back and see how am I, enabling, because the truth of the matter is, you can have. A lot if you want, but what I will not do is be there to help you you're gonna have to figure out yourself, because at some point in time. Until you recognize and feel your struggle at that moment, is when you were when you were reevaluate your own life, but you have to be able to stand your ground and make her she's like hey. I love my grandkids and I want to be here for you, but what i'm not going to do is continue to enable your behavior by always being there for you, because you think hey i'm always going to be here to watch these kids. Because, God forbid, something happened, and you get end up in you can't do anything for yourself and what does she do she will have to figure it out. And if she goes and knocking on every door and every door say there's no room at the end at some point she's going to have to stop and say hey. I got lucky. So sometimes we can sit here and say you know mom enables or but the truth of the matter is, have you stopped to look in the mirror and say how am I. As my grandma enabled but mom is also an evening by always making herself available to take care of the kids, but if you have to go on an errand and you say don't worry i'll take the kids with me. you're sitting here, trying to figure out how to talk to these kids I know when I have my younger kids that was one of the reason why I say. That, I have no more. Because I hate going to the grocery store and i'm having to push one cart what babies and one cart with groceries and nobody helping you push that on cart so little things like them is that you have she has the feeling, to understand it, but if you're always there to. pick up the slack she will never you're never allowing her to feel."
2015.0,Patient,Because she's 26 years old ain't no way you shouldn't have we don't all place. You have to be able to stand on your own. two feet.
207.0,Provider,"You have to allow her to feel it, you have it can hurt, but you don't have a feeling, you have to have a you have to come to that place within reason and within you know where it's not completely abandoning, but you have her feelings. Nicole. let's. have another patient in my weight when. We. Did the nine at the."
2015.0,Patient,Ninth of November.
207.0,Provider,yeah.
2015.0,Patient,"You know what thanks for telling me about that calendar on my phone, do you know it saved me settings me save me."
207.0,Provider,You need to put everything like that.
2015.0,Patient,"yeah I even told my son about it i'm like look cuz I think he. was almost late pandas one of his credit cards, I said, let me tell you some put that calendar on your phone put all the dates, you have to do something I sit in a pop up on there, and you can put alarm only. I loving. That is the best feature of this fall."
207.0,Provider,"Yes, it is. So the night."
2015.0,Patient,"at two. Yes, alright."
207.0,Provider,"Alright, have a good one."
2015.0,Patient,You too. And Baba Baba.
