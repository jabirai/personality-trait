13.0,Provider,Know it's really out of my wheelhouse it's not something I do I don't know enough about the medicines to really follow you with them so you're better off with the primary care doing it.
564.0,Patient,"first time I got one it was from the doctor at bright health, health and I just finished my my box. And that was from like four years ago."
13.0,Provider,wow yeah.
564.0,Patient,"say hello, it was just like midrin and I I only need it like once every few months and it seems to like stop the patterns, because after a while i'll get a migraine it gets triggered by everything anything. And if I just take one of those one time for migraine I don't seem to have one for a while not like horrible wanted to get a headache. Though I don't know what it is, I don't know why it does that but pretty effective."
13.0,Provider,that's good.
564.0,Patient,"I have some other like about the hormone creams and. I i've like over time, tailored it to fit me kind of how how I work that following the schedule it felt like it wasn't enough, we talked about that you increase my does that help. But when I take the progesterone I immediately felt horrible and then up until I get my period, but this last time I I waited too long, or I took it too late in my cycle and then I barely had a period, and then I didn't have one for eight weeks. And then, when I got one it was the most extreme reading it every period."
13.0,Provider,Like yeah. It was body or make up for it.
564.0,Patient,So. yeah okay like.
13.0,Provider,I yeah I mean it's just. it's but you're still making it a sick stickler right you're you're. going up and down and for 14 days you're adding the progesterone.
564.0,Patient,or fourth name.
13.0,Provider,yeah yes. How many days are you adding progesterone.
564.0,Patient,Right seven.
13.0,Provider,"Well you're not you're not getting enough. Half of the month you're just you're just estrogen half of the month, your estrogen plus progesterone."
564.0,Patient,"OK, I got the need to look at the. chart again."
13.0,Provider,"But it's it's not hard, I mean on day 14 on your day 14 you know the day when you peak is. Right it's the day one is your first period first day of period day 12 is when you peek, seven, eight, whatever and then day 14 is when you start the progesterone tell you at day 28, then you stop. You didn't do the estrogen."
564.0,Patient,"Okay, and then and I remember on that schedule that you gave me and it said that I know when to stop by my period starting."
13.0,Provider,Right. But if your if your period doesn't start you still stop it at day 28 and. Start over start with just the estrogen.
564.0,Patient,"Okay yeah, then I need to get my schedule figure it out, I thought I had it figured out was working fine until he had that happen, then I literally I learned what an ultra tampon and ultra pad were in like. One or two hours and I had to change it and that's never happened in your life, but it was. horrible."
13.0,Provider,"yeah if if doing the hormones correctly doesn't shift everything to normal, then you need to go get an ultrasound of you uterus."
564.0,Patient,As.
13.0,Provider,"Well, something else is going on."
564.0,Patient,like this something.
13.0,Provider,"I just I can just tell you that if you're taking the hormones correctly, it should be. A real minor period of three to four days without a lot of cramping and. If that's not the case, then there's something going on with mechanically with the uterus that getting in the way of how the hormones work."
564.0,Patient,"Okay, and yeah right now that's what's going on it's totally mild it's. very late. Not a big deal I don't feel horrible. yeah I think it's just because I messed it up, I will I will look at a schedule to get on a better track, but for the most part they've helped me a lot of."
13.0,Provider,Good.
564.0,Patient,and With you get right back like.
13.0,Provider,"I did, yes. i'm. i've gotten away from answering texts and emails I just won't even open emails anymore i've had so many people. take advantage of me that I I just I can't do it anymore, so it really becomes necessary to. create an inquiry with the virtual clinic with with the care coordinator, and so you haven't been here when the message comes across and you were late on on Monday, so you didn't hear people. Keeping the instruction, but the care navigator is Roy yet, and when you go to the virtual clinic if you ask for Roi yet. Then you'll get your problem solved much faster but. The. You know I don't know what happened to your script except they didn't give you what I ordered I ordered 29 and they gave you 26 I can show you the. yeah. There I thought he. described."
564.0,Patient,And I didn't understand but.
13.0,Provider,"and part of the problem was your insurance would only cover 30 days and that wasn't even enough for 30 days. I all I can tell you is the pharmacy did what they did, and I called them, I was on hold for ever I kept getting cut off and I had to start over I finally got through to them and. I got it so that you could pick it up on the 10th."
564.0,Patient,"How does that. Okay, nine and I don't have enough for that, but."
13.0,Provider,"Well, but you know the 29 would what you needed was. The 29 was for 33 days. 30 days would have been 27. And I right you got 26 so and you picked it up on the 14th so radically."
564.0,Patient,Because they were out.
13.0,Provider,"There then you're going to have to talk to them, I, I am not willing to call the pharmacy again."
564.0,Patient,I could just get.
13.0,Provider,him to do it.
564.0,Patient,"At all it's only the so listen to you, they don't give a damn about a patient that's an obvious or across all foreigners."
13.0,Provider,They don't respect you have.
564.0,Patient,Patient it into their uninterested.
13.0,Provider,you've been taking like the full to this whole time.
564.0,Patient,"No, not the whole time. But I did have to wait for my. trip. When I got it and I thought that. Because it was that none of time and I had to wait for it, I want it."
13.0,Provider,"Well, the date on the bottle says the 14th that you picked it up on the 14th. So that means you shouldn't need anything until the 14th or the 13th of January. You shouldn't be out until the."
564.0,Patient,"Third, one or day I always count the calendar days to make sure i'm on track. And they're supposed to give it before you run out."
13.0,Provider,And you're you're completely out.
564.0,Patient,"No, no. No, but I will be before the end."
13.0,Provider,"well. there's gonna be. yeah yeah you know you, you might go down to three quarters of a strip. And just drive out a little more. Because you've been on this point, you know 1.75 for a while and."
564.0,Patient,"What started as a weekend was. don't you remember that the whole like mishap that we've gone through and the fact that I had to keep her down because I was having a couple with the pharmacy and. We had to talk it out with them and fix whatever they done to it, it changed it made it hard for the insurance paid for it. me about the generic. Just a whole mishap with them so by the time I got it I had been out for a couple of days and I had to put myself down so that they would run out completely. And then, by then you're like well, I only want to give you the amount that you are on now I don't want to give you what you were on before. So he took me down and i've been down everything but I didn't want to be, and I know that I don't know the outcome to change that a little video but. it's just so much easier honestly to not have to to fractionalized and and it's just one a day and they're the smallest thing you can get there is no headaches, there is no concern."
13.0,Provider,Right well.
564.0,Patient,"And then i'm too worried if I blue blue on it, and it will also on the ground, did I."
13.0,Provider,write.
564.0,Patient,"It really. stuck as possible, and you have to nip off."
13.0,Provider,"yeah yeah. Whenever this happens, I think to myself, I would just want off this stuff I just went completely off, so I don't really get what the. You know, because i'm not in your shoes I don't get the emotional mental. place of. Of of holding on to being on the medicine."
564.0,Patient,"I mean. Without it, and in pain and I felt awful and then so much today, I mean that's what I was in before a. plethora. Of horrible but. I didn't start on the three I didn't start with here when i've never taken arrow in my life i've never injected myself anything I got prescribed medication for my team. Starting with the correct. And the five miles and that I already had was increased and he put me on those and it's not upset stomach. But there was a reason I was taking them in. I wanted off, something that was so crazy feeling and something that only lasted four hours at night it more and this last a lot longer and I don't have all. The side effects, you know or whatever they are they're much more manageable and then it helps without it, and in the same boat, I used to be well. You know thing."
13.0,Provider,"yeah and I don't know I don't know how you know, unless you're willing to do the research and the reading and really understand the pain management, no doctor now would ever put you on that medicine for more than six weeks. And we know so much more now about how opioids act and we know that, while you're on an opioid the the triggering in the brain for pain. happens without there being triggering from below, your neck all the triggering is happening. From a some kind of short circuiting that's happening and that doesn't resolve until you're completely off opioids. Once you're off the opioids, then you know what the what your real pain is coming from, because you don't have the opioid triggering. At old looping that's going on in your brain, but, most people don't want to hear that they don't believe I don't know they they think i'm making this up by I don't want to keep them on drugs, I don't know what people think, but."
564.0,Patient,"I don't think that it's not worth listening to I just. Even if that's true, it still occurred, and I remember not having any medication, it was awful."
13.0,Provider,yeah but what you remembering is not having anything that would would be in. Replacing the buprenorphine or the opioids.
564.0,Patient,"I added into. The NAO I dread that also helps with pain it completely forget the name of it, they put me on cut all the routes Raza don't. lyrica. receipt then."
13.0,Provider,Yes.
564.0,Patient,"yeah well they thought, maybe you're not in pain, maybe you're depressed I tried every email address and horrible Jerry side effects. And then they put me on you know the lyrica gather sense I would still feel drowsy I couldn't focus, I could drive I couldn't take care of my kid it was a mess, you know I you put me to sleep that was triggering like weird tremors in my neck I didn't stop taking it. All these other things that doctors use to help with things just don't they they have so many side effects that it doesn't. And this, and this. But after you get to the State goes, which I know is safer and I know it's it's you know, a much. healthier level. there's a difference there's definitely a difference if I move underneath that. It just is what it is. And yeah i'd be happy to stay on it. However long they can. Because, then you know when I when I don't have any more. than I have to go back to all that. Other."
13.0,Provider,"yeah I hear you're you're you're convinced that and I i'm not gonna argue with you, it is what it is you, you have your mindset, you have it fixed and. I the, the only thing I can recommend at this point to get you to the 10th is to. Go to three quarters of the strip instead of the seven eight to take get you to the 10th."
564.0,Patient,"Well, it would have had to figure it out, on my own anyway, but. And you, I have to stay at that level and go back up to the. worry about nothing, you know that something sure it adds up to something."
13.0,Provider,"well. So this is my dilemma. were I to put it back up to two. i'm i'm telling you i'm giving you the message that. You really are dependent on this medicine, you need it that's what i'm telling you. i'm going along you're running your program we're not running it together you're running it. and I. I feel stuck because. My job is to give you. tools for you to. understand how your. thinking and way of being contributes and. reinforces. The very thing that you don't like the the generation of pain and by my just going along with with what you want it says you're not in control it's the pill, you know you're you. you'll take the pill and. Then that's that's it."
564.0,Patient,"And you could say that and, like, I can see how you feel. But we didn't learn it together when I went down we didn't talk about it, we didn't plan it it wasn't, a thing that we did together. I got hit by a pharmacy and when they finally had what I needed you didn't want to get me to do that I had wanted to bring it down because I had a paper myself down to get through and something happening. Right now. And together, but this is this is you, I mean i'm not heard of it."
13.0,Provider,yeah. we'll just put you at the two milligrams and if you ever decide that you would like to have more control over your life you let me know.
564.0,Patient,You.
13.0,Provider,"don't take me this is not, this is not something you should be thankful for. This is this is me acquiescing this is me giving in, because. You you have. Because i'm not looking to fight with you."
564.0,Patient,And you think it'd be more fair We discussed it and went away with it we didn't even talk about it.
13.0,Provider,Monica you have a mindset that's fixed in this way.
564.0,Patient,And you.
13.0,Provider,"Right i'm not going to fight with that mindset I don't I don't have the personal energy I don't think it's my job to talk you into it my job is to facilitate. When you're ready it's not it's not to make you do something, and when when people get into this idea well Doc when you, you say I got it i'm. Now there are times when people have self medicated or they've done other things where I do get firm about where they have to go, how much they're going to do, etc, but this is not that kind of a case. You you have it in your head that you're going to be on this stuff. forever and you know, good luck i'm just telling you don't thank me for doing this because it's not it's not something nice and you're going to look back at this and you're going to say I wish she hadn't have done that I wish I had kept me tapering."
564.0,Patient,"I don't know if I think it like that, but i'm definitely going to think about what you're saying. I another thing is it's not just the focus on the medication it's me as a person. I I don't like to be. job and I don't think that's what you were trying to do, but it's it's how I process it. And instead of working with me, you know I want to be part of it, I want to plan it together and that way I don't feel like. There you go like you it's not up to you, if your body, but you don't get an insight. And if I was able to go through it with you like we did all the other day for you would let you wait till I was ready and then you would say. You know okay let's try this and I said that sounds good Okay, and I could mentally planet and I felt like it was a coordination that have. A command and you did not come in me and i'm not saying that you were mean or cool or anything like that. But that was just kind of a default that happened because of a mishap at the pharmacy and when we got down to two, which is what you always said to me. When you're at to you're at a State level and I no longer worried about it, so that is entirely up to you, you know, whenever you're ready and I just put with love for it to be that. I just started exercising again I went through a big one there where I just stopped taking care of myself very well, it just started, I felt awful but I know I need to do this it's like clearing out old toxin that going. But I really I really need this, and it is healthy. And I want to get through this and i'm caught resolutions that golden plans or any word revolution but goals and plans are taking better care of myself and one of them is. Removing as much medication, as I can, I only have three bottles of medication that I paid but removing as much well, I guess, this is for moving. Getting myself to a healthy place with more natural things after taking kava kava for the sleep thing that actually working i'm just going to stick with that. i'm looking at different herbs green powders and using them working with my gut treating my gut better making sure your vegetables and fruits, I really want to take better care of myself, I really am doing that I know how it used to. And that is all part of the plan, but I don't want to start at medication and then the rest follows I like to all kind of come together and I still am I good low. dose. You know so. I don't want to feel rushed. I want to do it in a way that feels natural. And I don't know, then I feel like I can connect to it, then I feel like. It was up to me and I accomplished it and I did it and now am."
13.0,Provider,I here yeah you don't want to feel rushed you want to you want to decide when it's time and then you can commit to it when it's your idea.
564.0,Patient,"You told me. a while back, but once I get down to you then. And I did I got there and i'm really proud of myself for doing that it wasn't easy."
13.0,Provider,yeah yeah you should be proud.
564.0,Patient,"And every class we take I feel like i'm the one with the lowest amount, you know and it still works. But. All the dredge if I ever people. With a new thing."
13.0,Provider,But you know the consequences it's. It just all it doesn't matter it just doesn't matter it.
564.0,Patient,With its own narrative I felt myself in my head and that's what i'm going to believe.
13.0,Provider,"You something, then, then it is what it is and. You know i'm going to be here for one more year and then i'm retiring so. I you know. I fully then people will do what they do, together with their new doctor so it's."
564.0,Patient,"I mean that actually gives me a good goal. If you're going to be done in a years and I don't know if i'll be able to have somebody that I am able to listen to, as well as in therapy, as well as I I feel like we have."
13.0,Provider,coming together she won't do therapy.
564.0,Patient,level yeah.
13.0,Provider,yeah you're. gonna be doing it.
564.0,Patient,"In a different doctor if you're going to be gone in a year, then I can. have a goal of being done with my heart, health and. getting down to that level feeling good and faith and this is Alex and I have."
13.0,Provider,One of the reasons i'm looking forward to getting you I did have an agenda just popped into my mind it's because of the fibromyalgia. it's because of the really good studies that show that the nail tech zone works so well for people who have fibromyalgia so I was looking forward to to you to getting you on to it.
564.0,Patient,"Well then, maybe in six months, I can I can start that. And really prepare myself for it. I have not, I have yet to see a patient who's still or or himself off, you know, work together if the patient completely off and they started know a lot of people in this."
13.0,Provider,heaviness you know why.
564.0,Patient,Because then they're done yeah.
13.0,Provider,"They don't come to group they stay in therapy, but they don't come to group. They could come to group, but they don't. But they they can they continue in therapy. You know quite a few."
564.0,Patient,"I remember Kelly, remember, she was down into talking about you know she was our two milligrams and she had all kinds of. horrible thing happened and her kids and she was a mess up with a ball of stress and then she's like okay i'm getting their mobile stairs and she was gone. And I thought reassurance that she was Okay, but that was that and then Sarah to. I don't know if you know therapy I don't know what happened to her, but i've ever heard that exact at this level, and then disappearing."
13.0,Provider,"yeah they. Are had someone just recently, who was at one milligram. He had been at one milligram for like a year, and something happened at the holidays, where he had had to leave town and you didn't let me know and he just he just. detoxed himself from one milligram and I said Oh, I really want to hear about that I want to hear what that was like for you, because I know what it's like to detox off of you know. Can or eight or 24 that's that's horrible he said no, he said, with the clonidine I just I just took myself off in the clonidine was all I needed. So you know was his physiology his way of doing it, I said, you know I would have given you some other medicines and made it even easier for you, if you had contacted me, but he he was fine with it and and he's just one of the people that is coming back to group and I put him on the naltrexone."
564.0,Patient,"night I would love to hear his story, or like how he's feeling how it went."
13.0,Provider,yeah.
564.0,Patient,How he was thinking. i'm i'm in the third secret there you were saying that I missed Monday.
13.0,Provider,Oh that's right ya know.
564.0,Patient,I where I don't even know that. That that.
13.0,Provider,I don't think they do and. yeah yeah there's no one in this group who. Is one person that's it one milligram. Another person that's it one milligram and one person who's not on anything.
564.0,Patient,In my room. uh huh oh wow yeah that's different to. wow well that sounds like a good group for me to be in. There should be some sort of I don't know introduce myself.
13.0,Provider,"yeah you. yeah you might want to you know we we didn't even think about it when if you're an I didn't think to get this was a different group and you needed to be introduced, but I don't be shy about doing that."
564.0,Patient,"Right, well, I mean there's always that I think that she was too few, and you know we all do our thing and go along and. done we're done, I mean you know, the whole thing is. up so unless it's a part of that plan and kind of hard to jump in and be like anyway. So. an icebreaker right."
13.0,Provider,I don't think.
564.0,Patient,"I do, that often enough. yeah there was, I think it was this class i've used this this makeup before if i've missed. And there was a blonde woman with blue eyes and she had I used it once before, and then a few months went by and I had to go come back again Maybe it was Wednesday. But she said, oh it's good that you're back i'm glad to see you're here with us again as if she was concerned that I had just fallen off the you know the map and. been gone, and this is my first time back because it's put back into class and you ever had a chance to tell I was like no this isn't my group, you know, and now that it is my group, I don't know."
13.0,Provider,yeah she she. Left very hard health. You won't see her again.
564.0,Patient,"he's doing good I you know. 30 people that I wanted to. stay in touch with that as well, but."
13.0,Provider,"Believe me, I know the feeling."
564.0,Patient,"yeah and people admit which i'm pretty sure i'm pretty sure they're still around somewhere, well, I always look at me what it is, but Carol card was in the last class that I used to be in before things change."
13.0,Provider,"yeah he went to a night group he wanted, he was taking a lot of classes, so he wanted a night group."
564.0,Patient,he's cool actually think I have his number I.

For like the 20th time. we're This is our eighth wedding anniversary you've been together nine years for this. triple handful. i'm. kind of proud of her name. And she's 32. I believe yep and she just had her second baby. Five months old. And she's always just been a very high strung person narcissistic love to talk about herself doesn't want to hear what anybody else thinks. feels like she's so much oh. By the way she made she's been married your husband for 16 years and you never talk. And because he has two little girls, which she had been trying for 10 years and that drove her crazy she finally got pregnant. You know, has a three year old now and a five month old and I always thought motherhood stopping her up a little while it's in my mind, you know, maybe she's like this, because she needs it still frustrated and not having babies. But also talked about social that are wanted now she has a baby. No she's just using the babysitter deficits and I and i'm a 36 year old grandma but you know cool I love them they're adorable. And every time we say or do something she doesn't like we wanted to talk about it, she just cut us off says, have a nice life, I never want to see you again blocks us on their cell phones losses on Facebook. it's just this simple disagreement it's not that big of a deal and she's done. forever."
13.0,Provider,gap which is.
564.0,Patient,"For forever, you know but. Right all just drives me crazy and feeling like this. Like when is this ever just a discussion where we can just yeah."
13.0,Provider,So Monica what i'm curious about is do you like her. Then what's the harm of her cutting you off.
564.0,Patient,But I don't get this with the grandbaby.
13.0,Provider,right that data that and and is that any of your doing.

564.0,Patient,throat.

564.0,Patient,And you. need our choice yeah.
13.0,Provider,I did yeah.

I felt bad, the way things went I apologize for what I said but I didn't take it that far and I said, all I wish that I could treat you like I treat everyone else in my family or my best friends. Where I if we have a disagreement just talk it out, I would love to have that I would love to. Get you and because she didn't respond it's. Probably not going to get but."
13.0,Provider,Monica.
564.0,Patient,She does not know how. I read it.
13.0,Provider,"doesn't do it with your husband, I promise you, she can. Get with her husband when she hears things she hears complete and total criticism and put down and and and she's reacting from her amygdala you there's really. No hope there. Unless you're going to go and become a therapist and be her therapist."
564.0,Patient,or and she's in therapy now she's taking a lot I think psychiatry.
13.0,Provider,baking right now she's not in therapy.
564.0,Patient,"And in yeah this like I said since then she's on a higher force is just that was I didn't feel that was possible, and now she you know she knows what she's talking about it and we don't she's she's discovered herself that you no longer brainwashed. And now, everybody really needs to listen, it needs to be an offense of how to you know what's so important about her oh yeah and he looked at it and give it the babies are what i'm really concerned about, but I did I had to."
13.0,Provider,Have control I don't have control.

13.0,Provider,i'm really sorry for the kids.
564.0,Patient,"To come that was part of the problem is she was being so cool to her three year old and I wasn't playing with her, and that was kind of what I brought up, but not only got in front of my kids in front of you know sheree and rain. She was talking about her sexual molestation abuse, rape and then she said that my husband hippie shit out of her mother, which never happened her mother was very violent and physical and shoved her several times to get her back. I think you'd like helder against the wall once, twice and he has never raised a hand to me not weren't never even close nothing of the sort, know punching moles nothing like that to get to have my kids here that he did that to her mom was very shocking for them. But also, both my role at this the sexual abuse. To hear all of the way too many details that she was sharing in front of them as if they weren't there and triggering no."
13.0,Provider,yeah.
564.0,Patient,"No problem I said, you know you know, and I didn't do it in an awful way, but I had to say something and then later I told him it. was worth it working. When we went over there, and that was really upsetting and I couldn't even comment on that without her flipping out who they were talking yeah that's the problem. You know and."
13.0,Provider,"He doesn't he had held inappropriate, it is."
564.0,Patient,"yeah to her it's like How dare you everything I say is is important and valid and you're telling me I can't be just watch yourself and sending my kid you know and your own. You know, was all um and then yeah the whole violence, it was it was it wasn't even true but they had to ask you about that later I would be followed by it looks like."
13.0,Provider,It oh i'm glad they asked you about it.
564.0,Patient,"Right, well, we do a lot of communicating in this House. or now, but that was just really upsetting and now now we're I weren't him because she wanted to bring them over to her house to have this formal event, where she told him something she remembered for past because she can you had to come over by himself so that she could tell us. When it that is like something that would be better to have a phone call. But she wanted kit they asked him to come over there and I could I could see that because I was there a couple days before. But with the kids and I can see that it was going to do this for rating that she does, just like in his face everything is your fault, what she does she's always said and he's made so many events and tried so hard to make her feel better and apologize for whatever mistakes, you make. And and and and so with her mother, but her mother she forgets continually to problems to her and I hate me and go through that so important in this is what she was saying, when we were there, you know and i'm kind of worried about what might happen when you go so keep your. head about your guard up you know realize that this is probably going to be what that is. And, based on what she's saying, right now, you know and more no more articles and more and and was infuriated it's like I can't believe that that never happened. You know and i'm gonna let her know and how it, you have to be that that never happened, and you know it, she she told him to you every day. And I was blowing things up blowing things out of proportion, trying to ruin their relationship and that she can now see my true colors."
13.0,Provider,"yeah. He he is a stick woman. Monaco she's a very sick woman and. And it it when you look at what's possible there in being with these grandchildren that's a completely. You really have to see what you're getting out of it to put any energy into. You can't rescue the children, unless you're willing to report her to see why fd."
564.0,Patient,"I thought about. It not so I mean she's not kind of the little one, and she will cry a lot but she's not horrifying either. So I don't think I could do. That it's a big deal to do that to someone in your family."
13.0,Provider,It is.
564.0,Patient,"idea. She keeps five dogs locked up in the bedroom in pages only listen, not to use the bathroom and and they're always in there in the cage in the dark with clothes piled on top of their pages. That makes me want to report that I oh I continually think."
13.0,Provider,It downward yeah.
564.0,Patient,"He goes over there, and he is so friggin stretch out the entire time over there."
13.0,Provider,I bet I bet he's picking up on all their. Capital vibes.
564.0,Patient,know.
13.0,Provider,So let's get back to how you get to feel okay that number one you don't have to rescue those children you can't you I mean you could do something very extreme but realistically you've got enough children of your own right now. No.
564.0,Patient,luck look I don't want to read them.
13.0,Provider,"Yes, keep loving them and and things will change over the years and there might be an. opportunity to mitigate some of her craziness with those kids there might be an opportunity just hold that hold the love there for that and but but let go of wanting to change her thinking, how you would just don't don't waste any of your energy. you're spinning your wheels yeah. Do you know what you get out of doing that. What do you, what do you like about thinking you you'll be the one to instruct her and she'll see the light and she'll have an Aha moment because you got to show her. The truth is."
564.0,Patient,"i'd like to be a mentor I see parts of. Yahoo, I to be getting her. That bad it might have. But. I want him to be okay I hate them yes to deal with this all the time, really."
13.0,Provider,yeah Well he that's a choice. He don't realize it.
564.0,Patient,But over here like if this is like 127. yeah. Oh good I. Like it's fine we're good.
13.0,Provider,"Good, then you need to let go of it, too, because um. What are your choices. You when you feel that I didn't know where it is in your body, but that Oh, I would like to be her rescuer yeah in your thriller i'll tell her the truth, I will be the wisdom maker, yes, that feels good now your challenges to find an audience that's receptive. find someone who wants to be mentored. Because then entering someone. Who yeah there you go and you're doing a fabulous job with them, and that will show that will show up."
564.0,Patient,hey tell me that pretty often.
13.0,Provider,yeah.
564.0,Patient,"I really do try, I am not perfect, but I always you know talk about it, maintenance when they make mistakes."
13.0,Provider,"Well, I think it would be very crazy making to have a perfect. You know you can't feel. Like I couldn't make mistakes and feel, just like a normal human if my parents were perfect. Right, how do you."
564.0,Patient,Cry nobody and then what yeah how could you learn anything.
13.0,Provider,And for the kids to have seen that rupture that miss miss communication happen and then for them to have the the courage and the confidence to come to you and say what was that about and they got clarification from you. That that that is the stuff of. really good mental health for them.
564.0,Patient,well.
13.0,Provider,Could you ever do that.
564.0,Patient,With your family oh God.
13.0,Provider,"No, no."
564.0,Patient,No.
13.0,Provider,"So you had to believe, whatever story, you made up as a little person if they hadn't been able to come to you. They might have latched on to a story that was inaccurate and then started behaving is, though, that story were true. And then you would have wondered about their behavior and not been able to connect the dots of how they got to that funny opinion but this way is cleaned up right from the beginning."
564.0,Patient,"yeah. that's awesome. If you realize that Yuri I mean she was always just told us button or let's don't even she was asked to very little about how she felt and what she thought that she didn't have words to describe any of it. And it's been over a year that we've had her and she knows she's safe and she doesn't have to go back now she can indicate, and she tries into things and she wonders, and she thinks about herself. And and and is able to extend it you're still working on me explaining of what how she feels that she tried. she's not going to you know and and she's she looks she cares enough to do so, you know and i'm very happy to hear all the communicating because she's so important. yeah and That to me is very basic necessity but for her it was not even not just it."
13.0,Provider,Right.
564.0,Patient,"Right so it's a beautiful thing to see. And yeah. Green but you know more of it now rain. Over at my house. is only ever wrong always wrong you're wrong you're wrong. And brains only comfortable when they're here, and this is the best place to stay get this is. sanctuary where we can actually talk about what's going on and feelings and how this makes sense of things. You know, and again really nice to do that, to my son luckily had very, very little calmer and it's like. No, this is probably around losing it other than anything we've done in him, and I really thought that you."
13.0,Provider,"yeah you should be. asked that part of you that part of you that wants to be a mentor. Does she realized that she is mentoring, some of the most important people in your life."
564.0,Patient,What.
13.0,Provider,"Okay. Is it Okay, if she doesn't mentor people who aren't interested in being mentored."
564.0,Patient,know. If I don't mentor other people who don't want to be.
13.0,Provider,Right your your your.
564.0,Patient,"Oh, is it a. daughter that's."
13.0,Provider,Why be mentored.
564.0,Patient,yeah yeah I.
13.0,Provider,want to. She hasn't asked for it.
564.0,Patient,And should I mentor other people that. know.
13.0,Provider,Well that's true. yeah like you. know only want to take on hopeless cases.
564.0,Patient,Oh.
13.0,Provider,yeah no.
564.0,Patient,"I get it, I get it. Okay it's really only had talking that when he did honestly. yeah I was gonna burn myself for silly reasons, but I really just wanted their relationship is better. than I thought it was well I."
13.0,Provider,"don't be mean to Monica she's a really good good person and she wasn't philly it was done for the best of intentions, you wanted to support him, you love those children blah blah blah it's it's it's really for a good reason it wasn't silly. But that part of you that. wanted to do it took control and then got slapped in the face."
564.0,Patient,"Right right, I mean it's easier to let go of notes, you can just be like Okay, whatever I this is enough enough. And just work. To be done because, if he were right now, just like oh really upset about it, then I would still like it."
13.0,Provider,"Why, why would you need to do something about his reaction."
564.0,Patient,"More more so, like what I could do with her to help them feel better I say everything I can to support him and make him feel better but."
13.0,Provider,What what could you possibly say to her. That would change her mental illness into coming out of her narcissistic bubble and seeing the other human beings around her. I mean. they're hiding.
564.0,Patient,"To me not lately, but there have been times that I helped a little. I just opened me, I guess, but things are quite different now. yeah and as long as you pay i'm okay with it."
13.0,Provider,"Well that's where i'm getting a little tweaked because. You are in the ideal perfect world. it's okay for him to be upset and you to be a separate human being and say I understand why you're upset i've decided that I just can't do anymore I i've. given it a chance she's not listening right now i'm sorry you're hurting but i'm not going to you don't have to say this to him, but you would say to yourself, I don't need to be hurting two hurts do not make a healing just two people hurting."
564.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
13.0,Provider,"See, so you don't have to make him different he can be hurting but you don't have to be. In order you know it's like you don't have to match that."
564.0,Patient,You don't yeah.
13.0,Provider,that's right.
564.0,Patient,mama bear.
13.0,Provider,"that's right, but you get goodies out of mothering. You get. yeah that's another part of you that, because you didn't get the mothering mothering gives you a nice. gooey positive feeling. And that's okay. Just recognize when you're doing it and and what its limitations are."
564.0,Patient,Okay. yeah. We need way less mothering.
13.0,Provider,"Well, now we have the wife. And you know, having a really compatible partner. is much better than having a mother."
564.0,Patient,yeah.
13.0,Provider,there's a lot of strings attached to mother.
564.0,Patient,yeah we've come a long way.
13.0,Provider,yeah.
564.0,Patient,"I remember that my main dilemma, when we were talking a long time ago about my marriage. you're telling me to dubbing it boom. yeah yeah. you're right. Well yea. Better about that I could do other things that we don't have time for that, like this one, but. It is but i'm tired of the answer to that."
13.0,Provider,So I would like to check in at least once a month. So can we can we make a tentative gate for February.

13.0,Provider,you'll tell me when you want to change. simple as that.
564.0,Patient,"Right right, but what what does it mean right now that's The only question."
13.0,Provider,Oh i'm gonna write a script for the two milligrams and see if they'll release it on the night.

13.0,Provider,Okay. Take care.

13.0,Provider,"But by. So, if you will cut and paste them, the main topics of what we talked about there was discussion of all these different medicines, the. coming to terms with part of her that. wants to be a mentor and is. doing it.
