And like I never thought that she would have liked me like that ever you know what I mean like, but it was like after just being there for a few days, and if I go to works like oh I missed you but one was like whoa. Like i've been gone for a day, where, if I come back to my parents for the weekend be like when are you going to come back like I don't like it when you're not here and i'm just like i've only been staying there for like a week like this is getting a little.

207.0,Provider,"Well, maybe sometimes it's checking your spam or you're drunk and seeing if. Everything is on track so. We look."
3835.0,Patient,happy. New years. yeah. yeah. What was. The idea.
207.0,Provider,"OK, I see that you're a. Drug screen. came up positive for Th. Th see and."
3835.0,Patient,means sure it was an arm. Okay. it's weird I haven't done any of those in a couple weeks it's been at least almost a month. But if it says.
207.0,Provider,seven. On seven.
3835.0,Patient,Though okay. Okay um then that's what it says okay.
207.0,Provider,"Oh, you say you haven't done any me."
3835.0,Patient,Not not amphetamine wise no.
207.0,Provider,A month ago What was it that you did too. I did.
3835.0,Patient,"I did. That I did a month ago. might have been like three weeks ago, that was the last time I did anything."
207.0,Provider,"Okay, so um. So you didn't miss about a month. After the time that you left the job or didn't have any bearing on the job."
3835.0,Patient,It was during that same time yes.
207.0,Provider,It was something that was offered to you through the job from people you know what the job was going on.
3835.0,Patient,yeah it was people at the job.
207.0,Provider,"Remember, we talked about this. is about being in a place to be. mentally prepared to take on a job and be able to resist the temptations and the urge not."
3835.0,Patient,"speak about that oh that was another reason that was another reason why I left to be honest, so but. The main one was the living conditions that I was in but also that was definitely a you know, a mistake."
207.0,Provider,"What have you learned from it, because I mistake is not a mistake if you haven't learned anything."
3835.0,Patient,"From right. Well, what I learned from it is, is that every single time I do it that specific thing, especially like I hate it and I hate the way it makes me feel and I don't understand why I do it when I did it like and. I just don't every time I do it it's like I don't like this, why did I do this, you know type thing and I just I haven't had an opportunity, or even turn it down since I left there, but if I did have an opportunity to I would most likely turn it down this time because I just don't."
207.0,Provider,"think you really, really, I want you to think about what you just said, he said that if you had an opportunity, you would turn it down. um but would you, because at the end of the day. it's not so much the the turning it down issue, it is the what is going on with you mentally Where are you emotionally Where are you, because if that is not addressed, and if you're not able to acknowledge and admit and work through that. you're never going to not turn it down because at the end of the day, where you are in every moment and every second of the day. It is that you feel this need to constantly suppress whatever it is that you feeling and so like you said about the your you know this individual and the way you are able to identify that individuals. Hard dependency on that need to the sense of belonging, or being accepted or or just being dependent, it is because you in fact struggle with that same thing that needs to connect and i'm. That that needs to dependent on someone else that needs to always have that connection with someone else so until Kenneth identifies and work through that and the more you struggle with it and you struggle with it because you're fighting it. you're fighting yourself to admit it you're always going to want to suppress those still feeling, so you know again going back to. A mistake is not a mistake if you don't learn from. The mistake."
3835.0,Patient,I get I get what you're saying.
207.0,Provider,"It wouldn't, be a mistake, do you think that you're in a position to go back to working right now."
3835.0,Patient,"No. Like physically, yes, mostly no. Oh. This depression and just like. I don't. Trying to think of the right words um. I don't know i'm still just messed up mentally from this past year, that I don't know where to begin with, to be honest, I just. know very unmotivated very just. I don't know complacent. um. I just I want more, and I want to do more for myself, but I just I like lack the motivation to actually want to do it. And it scares me. Because it's just like I can't just sit here for my life, you know what I mean I gotta go I gotta do something for myself, I feel like. Like I don't know i'm 37 and no job but getting bro like staying at my mom and dad's you know there's always things it's just like know where i'm supposed to be, and I guess i'd kind of dwell on it. And just pictured it would have been different for myself, you know, but then it's like me living in the past and that's not going to give me anymore either so i'm just I don't know. means like a start point here. That makes any sense."
207.0,Provider,"mm hmm. Do you think, is that even the environment that you're currently living in with your pan, do you think that. In your. Clinical depression."
3835.0,Patient,Someone yeah.
207.0,Provider,What and how it in what way does it contribute to it.
3835.0,Patient,"Just I mean stereotypically i'm at where i'm supposed to be, and I guess like I don't I don't have like a place to call like home like that's mine, you know and i'm used to it. So just like it, I guess security thing or something like a sense of like like I have a place that I can call mine I guess um. I don't know just feel really on successful."
207.0,Provider,You feel so what else can you identify that the eighth in your.
3835.0,Patient,"Stay successful and say there's this little negative things that I think about myself like not worth it, or. This is the way it is you know what I mean type deal like this is, this is my life i've been like this for this long and this is probably how it's going to stay mess, the way my mind things. But it's one way it's kind of like the devil, you know, and then I have another voice, you know it's you know. Like I have some positive things that i'd say about myself to like i'll get in moods where i'm like you know it's going to be a good day or whatever, but for the most part, no not really most days aren't very good days for me right now."
207.0,Provider,What would you say your energy level.
3835.0,Patient,Out of one to 10 probably like like three or four.
207.0,Provider,Do you have no energy multi.
3835.0,Patient,yeah.
207.0,Provider,"um do you do you do anything to help increase a boost, your energy. Healthy or unhealthy."
3835.0,Patient,"No, not really. not really are you talking about like exercise and stuff like that."
207.0,Provider,"Yes, I said healthier or unhealthy traditional or untraditional what whether one part of you using any form of drug or trying to inform of job is to help to boost your energy level or do you try natural. Things like whether exercise so that's why I said healthy or unhealthy."
3835.0,Patient,"No, I don't really do any of either especially recently, like the only the only mode of like. And I wouldn't say in the past, while that have done anything healthy to motivate me. steam honest on but recently I haven't done anything unhealthy like substances to motivate me either so i've been trying. i've been trying to like maybe time will help that. On you know, like I keep thinking, maybe like if I give myself like a little bit of time to get better like that i'll feel better. Oh. which I mean I had made. Like in my depression level has gone down quite a bit. Since, in the past, since the holidays and stuff you know. Since I moved back here i've been just like kind of just staying at home, not doing anything like me just trying to like i'm not per se trying to isolate myself, but I just feel safe where i'm at i'm."
207.0,Provider,And I feel safe from what what typically.
3835.0,Patient,Stay from just outside see from like the cold safe from I don't know other people in temptations.
207.0,Provider,What would you say the biggest part of that for you would be.
3835.0,Patient,What do you mean like the biggest part of it. Like what's the biggest issue.
207.0,Provider,"You said that you said that i'm. safe from. Everything So do you find that you isolate yourself more because of you um. Would you say that you, you isolate yourself more. From a standpoint of. Not having any opportunity to be tempted. triggers are. True triggers are more from your. Urges but the temptation comes, because now you have put yourself out there to be more exposed and so therefore you to consult consultation, so is that what you find."
3835.0,Patient,yeah that's what i'm finding safety from.
207.0,Provider,"Okay. um. Now, in terms of you, having difficulty concentrating."
3835.0,Patient,yeah sometimes.
207.0,Provider,"Okay. And I know you spoke a little bit about you know self esteem and you know questioning you know different things do you have any thoughts of. So far, any your life."
3835.0,Patient,"at all. No, I wouldn't go that far, with it."
207.0,Provider,"Have you ever. So what would you be so in assessing everything like you said, the biggest thing is your depression and I think that's something that we've been battling with for a long time so just one moment, let me look at your well you look at the last page to nine that you completed. According to this you haven't done one. In terms of. I really would like you to get to to ensure that every single week that you complete the pH and i'm because that's that kind of measures that I want you to answer it on fleek. Because actually measures. You know where you are clinically. When it comes on to your depression, we it does assess for anxiety, but according to this mean the last time that it's documented it says that it was mild Bo it says both anxiety and depression or mild but based on how you're speaking it it's not. A little bit more moderate to. Severe I E your evidence is all evidence by your struggle to maintain sobriety. You have. difficulty maintaining your sobriety and if I was supposed to review back your your history of. which, let me go back to that for a second looking at your drug screen if I go to the history of that and, when it was successful. Okay, so. When you completed it back in December. It was very hard to read it said it was activated the only thing that they could see was the marijuana they weren't able to detect of it. Oh yeah so there was another another one then between prior to that there was the thc but then from we didn't get one for October and November I didn't see you didn't complete a drug screen for October and November. And then so we're going back to. Prior to the September screaming the last one that you did was in May and. I mean seems like a couple little like a Christmas tree. yeah it had the do which we want to see the thc the benzo the and the math I mean that was back in May and I knew. And I know that you definitely had some struggles, back then, and then, so there is so what I want to see here is. So one of the goals in terms of just assessing and helping you just to maintain sobriety so let's just start like this is your biggest goal like you said earlier, your biggest thing your top priority your main priority is to maintain your Friday right. To maintain it not on a 30 day span, but on a weekly fan but let's just let's just go with weekly because now i'm meeting you in group every week so. you're to maintain their sobriety it's that what, in order to maintain that how are we going to make that measurable is that every week you guys come to group. Every week, you have to ensure that your surveys are completed, because this is how i'm even able when i'm working with you to effect. size, are there any improvements, what are you were checking in to see how it so that's why you have to complete those surveys, because I can see. Your depression level of when we meet when we tell whenever we mean group or individually. You know what is that, like what are you reporting based on high end being honest with those surveys it's not punitive it's not meant to be served, these are not a punishment it's just to see. What is the progress and if there is no progress, then we really need to get a little deeper to see what is going on what is what is, what is the thing that you're struggling with daily, so I need to see the surveys, ensure that your your surveys are completed each week, this is not. compliant that's one thing, but for me as a clinician I need to see really ultimately where you are. If whatever goal we're working on is is very what is the the the the progression of it, what is the is there any regression what is going on there. Also it is. Ensuring every single month without skipping a beat we are checking. Your own drug screen and being honest with that listen I know there's 101 ways to cheek our drug screens, but I want to be honest with that because, again, your overarching goal your way long term goal is to maintain your sobriety that is your primary. Is that is how. I maintain my sobriety is that I have to I could live with cheryl all day long I legitimately can ladder Shell all day long, but you cannot lie to yourself. We need to measure your drug free you know it is not showing up if there is all other things, showing up okay what's really going on. Because, at the end of the day. slipped because. i'm struggling i'm really struggling and what am I struggling with. We need to do when was the last time you went to a group outside of my heart, like a. connecting with other groups anonymous groups or."
3835.0,Patient,Last week.
207.0,Provider,"Okay, which one did you go to one locally or did you."
3835.0,Patient,I want to go for.
207.0,Provider,"Now, looking at your chart historically. That any family history."
3835.0,Patient,"Well, in. Like using drove. My mom said there's wow follows on. and other other substances to i'm pretty sure, but now like. Not more than that, more than a call maybe some pills in there, or something, but for the most part, my dad's side of family isn't really you don't use really my mom's yeah."
207.0,Provider,Okay now looking at the history. mom had. her own history of alcohol abuse. and suicide attempts. Your parents.
3835.0,Patient,"yeah. very, very lightly now. They used to be really bad, but not anymore, maybe they go like once every three weeks or so."
207.0,Provider,In order to maintain your sobriety. What are some triggers even within your health.
3835.0,Patient,i'm. Saying just like sometimes just being in like my basement. Where I mean really the whole houses.
207.0,Provider,What.
3835.0,Patient,"A trigger. kind of brings back just a lot of memories of. Just yeah good things. But there's a lot of good things that have been here too, but. I mean, this is a hard place to be, for me, sometimes but it's better than some of the other places that could be right so."
207.0,Provider,a hard place for you to be. So when you leave to try to go and do your independent. You feel defeated when you have to return back.
3835.0,Patient,yeah.
207.0,Provider,"So. Is there any drinking a foothold on in the home, do you drink."
3835.0,Patient,"No, I don't know and there's no drink my mom doesn't drink anymore my dad doesn't drink at all. I think there's been a six pack of beer in the fridge since like July, you know what I mean way. But yeah there's not there's not any junk and that goes."
207.0,Provider,"Oh, you think just the memory, the just memories in. There are different triggers physiological psychological emotional all of that, it then becomes more difficult for you. yeah so in terms of support in helping to maintain that sobriety where can you honestly honestly say, do you think that there's a lot of it at home or it's just kind of haphazard."
3835.0,Patient,"I mean there's still a lot of it here that I can like positivity you know what I mean like. Like I have to support. My parents and everything they're really they're great you know um yeah I mean there's nothing here, that is, triggering me physically like at any time to be like here use this or you know there's not like. I don't know it's hard to explain because it's, just like the whole mental aspect of like everything that's happened in the House within the House like within my old bedroom to again, you know I went as far as like rearranging the room to."
207.0,Provider,What happened in your bedroom.
3835.0,Patient,Just just getting lunch like.
207.0,Provider,"None of those cancer you don't know when you say you want to far as rearranging your bedroom, we have to be honest, it. makes. The medicine go down a little bit easier are resistant to it or are fighting with the truth it just make become the big bonus that gets stuck in our truth, because we don't want to face the truth. So, in order for us to work on maintaining your goal of maintaining sobriety is being honest about. What are your real triggers because at the end of the day, can we could talk all day long we could we could go on about the same thing I could do all the check in with the do all the surveys, but if you live in the midst of. The trigger every second of the day, what goes back if the person who's working with you don't know that you're standing in the deep in."
3835.0,Patient,"The room my right you're right, I mean it's just as far as rearranging the bedroom where it's like just to look different from any other time that i've lived here, you know just so it didn't. Just didn't resemble like the last time I was here or here, you get what i'm saying it's not it's not anything like really bad happened here it's just the memories of like getting high all the time here."
207.0,Provider,that's.
3835.0,Patient,pretty much.
207.0,Provider,So. Is that the reason why every time you get an opportunity and move out before you try to move out because yeah.
3835.0,Patient,pretty much.
207.0,Provider,Do you think that going to your brother sometimes is a. memory of. Just being around your brother and his family and just knowing you put your your overall history.
3835.0,Patient,"I feel, out of place. I feel like i'm almost like a burden. In a way, like ache or I feel jealous or I feel you know. Just all sorts of different ways about. Being over there i'm. Just makes me feel Oh, sometimes it makes me feel grateful, sometimes it makes me feel just jealous sometimes it makes me feel like I just don't belong I don't know. Maybe I don't belong there I don't belong here I don't belong anywhere like Adam I don't know I just don't have."
207.0,Provider,"A place to you Okay, but specifically what is it about your brother beating around your brother that makes you. feel jealous."
3835.0,Patient,"I just wish I would have worked harder and life period, like in general, like like worked harder at doing better for myself. and caring. You know i've never drew boundaries for myself i've never I don't know live a healthy life."
207.0,Provider,"I do feel that way because of. your brother, even with his own history of wife and everything else you feel by he. Do you feel like he. He drew boundary for himself into work through it."
3835.0,Patient,"Oh yeah. most definitely i'm just a real strong person. On that, and he just I mean I don't want the two kids and. Harry now I mean and maybe one day, but like it makes me jealous to that I didn't you know experienced that life well. Just I mean I guess it's like your whole American dream, or whatever you want so called it, you know what I mean like it just. isn't there for me. Just to play I just like want to be comfortable and a place that's mine and live comfortably that's I mean it would be completely content and happy with that."
207.0,Provider,Define define contentment and happy.
3835.0,Patient,Just simple.
207.0,Provider,Simple.
3835.0,Patient,"Simple would be like just go to work go home you don't maybe have a girlfriend and a dog or something and go on vacation once a year, or something I don't know something simple."
207.0,Provider,"Something something like what your brother lives right now. In looking at. Again, in looking at your your overall. goal let's just keep it. Simple for right now, because I think overwhelm you. Simple would be maintaining the party completing the surveys. Coming to group so from a compliance standpoint is following through with that. um. This is something that oftentimes when I find it very difficult for a person. To but I really want you to do this because I want to be able to check in. and see. want you to identify and the next time we meet. When you, you said that, overall, your House is a trigger because we're we're looking at clinical depression we're often looking at all of these external factors and i'm going to say external in your situation be everything outside of your home. And I think everything outside of your home or factor, but it sounds to me kind of the biggest thing that you contend with it's not outside of your home in your home. And it seems like you're trying to escape it. And what brings you to the depths of your despair, is that every time you try to escape you end up back in. it's like a person who gets incarcerated and every time they get they, the door is unlocked and they come out somehow they come right back in. And so that ceiling of that the feet that feeling of. You know I just have to it's like you're trying to tell yourself it's, the more you talk to yourself, and you can you say is this is for me is this how it's always going to be, it is like you're fighting with accepting that this can't, be it. because every time you you you escape you come back. And do everything within that home, not to say that you don't love your parents and. What they're trying to do, and then being there for you. it's time to say that, but when it's all said and done it. Some of my biggest stressors are even where I live. My home of work. And if I have to look around and every time I see the parents that I love, but it's still the memory that I tried to escape because it's one thing for me to have a memory. But it's another to still live. In that reality. and keep having to remove these memories and create new one, in the midst of it. I want you to be able to jot down, specifically when you look at. You know I am really depressed and i'm battling with my depression and I, and I, the things that I do what I reached for is. To alleviate the symptoms of my depression. I want you to be able to shut down and identify, is it a conversation with your parents, is it just the bedroom is it that sitting in my basement only brings on the depression more. Because it is my means of escape but I don't even like this escape. I want you to I want you to honestly do this I want you to Journal in the next time that we meet I want I want us to re evaluate this, and the reason why I want to do this. it's because I want you to be able to come to that true write it down and say, and I want you to hear it back so you understand what you have been fighting with every day. i'm looking at my calendar. We can meet next week."
3835.0,Patient,Next Thursday at 1030.
207.0,Provider,"Next Thursday the 20th at 1030 and then. 27th at 1130. So i'm giving you two appointments i'm going to meet you next Thursday, for the rest of the month, every fairies so next Thursday at 1030 and the last Thursday 1130. So when I see you in group out ensure that I. remind you of these appointments okay so between now and then everything so basically we're checking in did you complete your survey that I need to be able to monitor those surveys to see what it is especially related to your depression scale. look out in the mail for another drug screen because we're going to review your drug screen next month. I want you to drop now, whether it be journaling if you find yourself sitting in your bedroom sitting in your your basement or what have you and you lack energy you're. Just jot down what are some of those things I want you to identify at least three things. That you battle with every day. When they think about your triggers. What are the three things within your home that you battle with every day. Okay."
3835.0,Patient,All right.
207.0,Provider,"All right, then, my dear, I will see you on Monday."
3835.0,Patient,"Alright, thanks for show."
