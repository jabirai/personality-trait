11755.0,Patient,"The. The owners of my company asked me to also travel to Boston and Dallas with them to set up their new offices and i'm super excited i've never been to Boston I have been to Dallas. I used to be engaged to a man before my husband. He was my have serious college boyfriend and I moved to nashville to work for Saturn and he was a pilot and moved to Dallas to work for a commercial airline like I like. Where they call. Where you rent an airplane the wealthy rent an airplane to take. Remember what it's called. So we were going back and forth, and I was completely 100% in love with him, he he gave me a ring he years we were planning a wedding. We were going to get married in Hawaii and he just stopped calling me out of the blue. He stopped calling he's up returning my calls and I was just like devastated. and I was just like in shock, I mean we had things booked it was getting done and we just fell apart never got any closure never knew what happened number knew why, and I moved out to California shortly thereafter, and was like I went to Hawaii anyway. With my sister and. About a year later he called me I was living in in Santa Monica and he said i'd like to come see you. And I was like oh boy he came. And he told me that he got cold feet. And I remember. That was back in the day when you could actually take somebody to the gate."
252.0,Provider,yeah.
11755.0,Patient,"When he left, he said. You don't have to walk me to the gate and I remember he he loved airplanes I mean he was just obsessed with airplanes and used to we used to. He would fly me around because he had just his. Private pilot's license. And he would fly me to go see my grandparents and. I mean it was so sweet and we went to La X and we parked on one of those top structures, so we could see the planes taking off and we sat and talked for a minute. And I remember him walking away and me just being like closure, it was that was like a God moment because I didn't I just was like Okay, this is over, I don't need to feel bad about any of that anymore. And I just went on, with my life. Now yeah I never heard from him again and. His mom and my aunt were both real estate agents in the same town, and I know they work together. Even to this day. But I never hear anything about him he's not on social media is not."
252.0,Provider,Even aware. Like wow.
11755.0,Patient,"So. So anyway, he when he went to Dallas I had visited there a few times but yeah i'm just I don't know i'm just. grateful and. I kind of feel like oh. Like pinch me I almost don't believe it's really true that, like good things are happening to me. feel good. Like i'm waiting for the other shoe to drop kind of thing i'm waiting for myself to Fuck it up somehow sabotage myself somehow. And I I keep thinking like. you've been known to drink you've been known to be in a good spot and get some time and you've been known to drink and and I kind of like check in with myself to see like you feel like drinking. And what under what circumstances do you think you would drink or maybe you should just not drink and i'm like yeah I mean these kinds of conversations in my head and. I don't feel like drinking so. it's a good day. yeah and I just I think like. The day by day just being Okay, in this day and not worrying about what's going to happen in the future, am I going to have a bad day and feel like drinking, one day, or you know be tempted just to not let that just even enter my mind, because, like. To stay has been just great, and all I did was wake up early come to work, one of the owners came today and we had a great conversation about raising daughters, because they just had a daughter who's one and we were actually talking about. Our kids and drinking and drugs."
252.0,Provider,Oh wow.
11755.0,Patient,"They don't know that i'm an alcoholic. But my daughter teague and I I don't know if I said this that group, but she was exposed to a bunch of drinking from her friends this past weekend she was the designated driver. And she took care of several of her friends and invited two of them that were too drunk to go home and she didn't want them to get in trouble from their parents to come over to my my ex's house and stay the night, and she called her dad and said. Get ice waters and puke bucket it's ready. Because i'm. And so, she took care of them, and she was a good friend and she was safe and she at that moment, she said no to partaking and I was just like so proud of her. What a great friend. What a smart girl and. You know I took the opportunity to talk with her about a little bit more about because typically when I try to bring up my drinking or alcoholism or anything related to that they're just like no we don't want to talk about anything serious. we're good mom it's all good don't worry mom and I, and she she didn't do that she's I asked her. If she'd ever drink. And if she wanted to drink. she's not drinking if she was curious about drinking and she said not really kind of felt like she. She was. curious better she said no, and I, and she said, I know that some of my classmates do harder stuff. mm hmm and I asked her what that was and she said pot and hills. And she's 16."
252.0,Provider,mm hmm.
11755.0,Patient,"I mean I you hear about it all the time, I mean in meetings. kid yeah most most people that share it meetings have shared that they partook in something long before 16. yeah so I kind of feel. proud of her for for holding now I don't know if my situation has scared her into not wanting to try anything I know my younger one has not tried to either. But I also I was telling will the guy that came over you know, and I was like you know I don't want to be the like doom and gloom like you're going to die. Right this or you know I don't do it, you know I want them. To have their own journey but understand the risks yeah and know that I am. I am a questionnaire retail in some respects, but they can also come to me and talk to me about it and tell me if they want to do it. and know that i'm i'm here and non judgmental and they can tell me anything and I don't need know anything, and you know they can. I just want them to know that i'm a resource um. So. And will was telling me what his dad told him, which was. Nowadays. You don't know what you're getting when you buy drugs. You don't know what you're getting. Through it, and. will actually is a really big like comedy fan he loves comedians and he's always following different comedians and I guess, there was a famous comedian. who bought cocaine, with some of his friends and there were four of them, and it was laced and three of the four died recently like in the last week. and You know the fourth was in critical condition yeah and. So you know everything seems to be laced with that law, and you have no way of knowing whether you're getting molly or you're getting blow or you're getting whatever. that's right that know is just everywhere and it's so scary and I just you know, and these kids are dropping like flies they're just dying left and right because they don't understand how dangerous it is so I I was like thinking I I haven't had a Sentinel conversation with them. I don't know what do you think about that, what do you think about like how to communicate with kids about them all."
252.0,Provider,"um. well. I would definitely let them know that even back even back in when we were teenagers, you know we came out of the marijuana came out of ground, you know, there was dirt we there was you know the really good Bud that's what there was, but this is, you know. And everything is genetically altered. You know, not just marijuana but also every other hard drug and you know they. giving them the information that number one you never know what is in what you're getting and it might be the one time, and the last time you use, just like those friends. You just never know. And had understanding that as they're walking into a situation and maybe you're curious to try something. You know, giving them that information that fitness is a deadly deadly drug and look it up Google it tell them to Google it it's all over the place, and that they don't want to listen to mom listen to Google, if you they listen to Google better Google tells all. And it's everywhere."
11755.0,Patient,"I mean I don't know if I should. Tell them but i've known people who died. Like if that will get in deeper or if that's just like too much you're going to scare them or whatever if they really because you know if they read it on the Internet and they hear it from their teachers it's sort of like that yeah for us, they just don't want us to do it. And they're going to make it found scarier. or some you know we they still think that they know best or they're like oh we're just going to try one or whatever."
252.0,Provider,"You can also bring up what you the story you just told you just said hey you know what you know you know what I just found out check this out look at this story these poor guys. You know, and let them, you know you guys read the story together so that they're hearing it and you're not preaching to them, I know mom and I preaching to them, but you're sharing the story that's got your attention. You know fentanyl is a scary job."
11755.0,Patient,I know I have heard so much about fentanyl that way too much than I ever thought I would ever know yeah just because i've been in this program for so long yeah i've been to treatment so many times.
252.0,Provider,"yeah, it is a horrible horrible drug."
11755.0,Patient,"I just it's so scary and sad and. unnecessary and get evidently it's very easy to get. because everybody seems to have it. seems to be able to get it, and I mean even the last treatment Center is that. These guys got fentanyl in there. And they were like literally residents of the treatment Center. yeah and managed to get a delivery to one of the outings that we had. yep I was just like. Just like you can buy it on craigslist."
252.0,Provider,yeah. yep it is just as readily available as. heroin as methamphetamine and both of those released with it now. I.
11755.0,Patient,Totally forgot about math i'm feeling molly blow but totally.
252.0,Provider,Oh yeah it is.
11755.0,Patient,"Sure, and they."
252.0,Provider,"It sits back this is what gets me about methamphetamine right, we always hear about the opioid crisis and about you know people being on it, but. We really it might we're you know poke his his little head up the here and there about it, but it is running strong on the streets, it is running strong."
11755.0,Patient,"kill kill, as many people. Like his."
252.0,Provider,own again.
11755.0,Patient,"Right yeah for sure, but. Generally from like math oldies or math i'm like being on la for a long time, is it as deadly Dino."
252.0,Provider,"Well, it is deadly your heart continually can explode but now that they are mixing it with fentanyl depending on how much math you do only they don't call it a myth OD they call it an opiate OD offend nobody right they contribute that factor into the death methamphetamines can. eat your brain can eat you can eat your insides can. explode your heart. You know. It runs out."
11755.0,Patient,"That mess, with the most addictive of all the drugs."
252.0,Provider,"Well method and i'll tell you why and it's probably too um and i'll tell you why why. Because the detox has always been sleeping. Right. So there's none of that opioid detox that goes with it, but now that they're adding fentanyl in it that's changing."
11755.0,Patient,"And people are getting more have type at. My arm my brother my youngest half brother. got into math and he went to jail, he went to treatment he couldn't do judges like drug Program. Just was fucking around got put in jail for a year. You better. kind of got his life back on track became. electrician. He went all the schooling and the apprenticeship, and everything and he was like getting up going to work they love to network he's a great guy and but he could not stop drinking. and his he got married over coven. For sweet lady she was a traveling nurse a traveling physical therapist she could not find a job in the hometown in nebraska where they were settled so she did another like three month gig in Colorado and during that time, I guess, my mom told me he got back into math. And I was just like i've talked to my brother a lot about it because he's the only one, my family that even remotely knows what i'm going through him and my step dad his dad. His dad was no call I can have like 35 years sobriety like. A lake i'm just like I want to call him and just you know say hey dude remember me remember the one that you can tell anything to because I get it. My mom said that Lacey his wife is back in nebraska and is whipping him into shape, whatever that means he won't go to therapy won't go to a won't go to anything."
252.0,Provider,he's not ready yet. And there's nothing that she can do.
11755.0,Patient,I know. read them.
252.0,Provider,You know what I mean watch him watch his phone you know.
11755.0,Patient,"And I know you love her to death. But. You know he's got. he's got issues with that he has, for years, and he does not want to do anything differently. To stop it yeah. And I mean the again. The conversations that we've had. Like he seems very open about it wasn't a problem, he sees me trying stuff. Right treatment, a therapy i'm doing it all i'm despite. Everything whatever it takes medication i'm going to try it. And he just he kind of like good for you to kind of thing yeah. And he's me he doesn't think that."
252.0,Provider,"You know work for him, because you know being addicted to alcohol is different than me and being addicted to map, you know totally two different demons you know i've heard it all right, the reality of it is, is that he's got to be ready it's got to hurt bad enough. Before it's ready and that's no different addiction is addiction is addiction period right, I can tell you from my own personal experience that you know my there's my generation and then there's you know my. Adult children's generation and so. My nephew he has been doing math and with that a lot of times with the people that you're hanging around with getting meth and buying nothing the areas that you have to go to get it. there's a lot of criminal activity that goes on, with that. And so my nephew had stolen guns is beautiful shot himself in the leg right there is artery right through his his broke his bone and half his female. Oh hospital right now. And wishing to God that he would have done something different math puts us in this realm where we don't see what what the potential is coming our way and it just spirals right on down right on down. You know it's horrible horrible. And that's what i'm saying is that you think about like the opioid crisis, you know that's been in the news and all of these people are in trouble and silently silently methamphetamines laced with fentanyl is just grabbing Ahold everybody, you know. it's just it's disgusting it just makes me sick that they want to like explode this one and just leave this one, you know, like it's a side or something. really not."
11755.0,Patient,"Oh, I look your nephew is going to be okay."
252.0,Provider,Well he's probably facing a lot of time in prison. And these are the consequences and how bad it can get you know.
11755.0,Patient,Every.
252.0,Provider,morning everyone warned them right nobody does one listen and want to hear what's happening.
11755.0,Patient,yeah.
252.0,Provider,"yep so you just got to be there when they hit that bottom and love them through it, you know."
11755.0,Patient,"i've not been like that, for a long time, when it comes to my drinking like in my even my opiate using my pill use like I never. I don't remember ever kind of pulling it off or telling somebody like I said i'll be fine like I always knew that there was no chance, I will."
252.0,Provider,"yeah. Some people, though they think that they've. got it under control, they. think that everything is great."
11755.0,Patient,little bit or whatever.
252.0,Provider,it's the illusion. This wearable.
11755.0,Patient,made those i've had those delusional thoughts in my head. Just this weekend and i'm going to get back on it i've def definitely done that.
252.0,Provider,i'm not that bad. Right right something bad.
11755.0,Patient,You know.
252.0,Provider,It has to get that bad. Right and that's thing.
11755.0,Patient,"I can't have any qualms about like realizing that. Further, I went again from that last bender. You know it's something. But I have to remember that thing i've got to remember that i've got the horror and the sadness and the. discussed, I have to remember all of it."
252.0,Provider,"Yes, you do. and"
11755.0,Patient,"When I was at Betty Ford, I wrote a bunch of stuff about that, because they had us right like are consequences. And I was like okay i'm just going to delve into this. And I I have all that but I kind of need to like bring it out into the forefront, a little more like maybe. Because I mean I drank after Betty Ford. Oh, I forgot somehow I forgot the word. The horror that that I endured, and then I made others into work. So. I wonder if I put that my storage unit. That notebook and the goddess it, I mean, I know I kept it because I saw it, when I was moving. yeah I I had a sponsor tell me once to put like. The worst things like in your purse write them down and put them in your purse the five worst thing ever happened. So that you remember, and if you ever have that idea that oh it's going to be okay i'll just have a couple."
252.0,Provider,"pull that out and read it remember where you're going where you're headed again it's kind of funny to me because. You know, for me, what I see is addiction and domestic violence on the same. You know why do women go back to their abuser. Why. Because we forget how horrible it was, and we want to hold on to the hope that it's going to be different this time. Right same thing with addiction."
11755.0,Patient,"I mean, I did that with gail. gail for six months and. Oh, my gosh thinking this can't be right, he can't like really be this abusive like he was so wonderful like this can't be true he's going to change he's going to come around yeah. yeah why I have you so you can say artist, let me tell you what's real."
252.0,Provider,"Right. it's really true. And what do we teach in domestic violence classes, but we teach them to keep. The worst. In the forefront if you've got a got a post it up on the refrigerator if you've got to put it on your mirror in the bathroom when you start feeling that all I love him I can have one drink Oh, it would be okay, I can do this right."
11755.0,Patient,that's so interesting that's a very good point. You know what would behoove me is to get like all of the. photographs that they took of me first day of every treatment Center that.
252.0,Provider,I make a collage.
11755.0,Patient,"That would be. A big deterrent, that would be the. Time because not only did I look like hell, but I remember how I felt that day."
252.0,Provider,yeah.
11755.0,Patient,"That was, like the worst day of my life like six different times. Because just to realization that I am back here again I. Find I thought my life even worse. And I am like starting over so I will obviously it could be considered like. Every time I when I was like i'm going to get this this time, this is my time i'm going to do it, I want it like whatever I need to do every single time I went in like that, so there is like a positive aspect, but there is just like a negative because my bottoms boy yeah."
252.0,Provider,"yeah mostly it most of the time, it is, it has to hurt that enough in order to make that change, it has to. You know, and that sucks, but if you can keep that like really make a collage."
11755.0,Patient,I didn't.
252.0,Provider,Remember.
11755.0,Patient,"When you, Sir, have access, I would have to actually call those treatment centers and."
252.0,Provider,"Get the things. We used to get take pictures of everybody, because I worked in residential in Oregon when they came in and the day they left. And we would put it in. You know, a card for them so. Really. In now right, so they could see and always have that reminder of where they don't want to be anymore right."
11755.0,Patient,really nice.
252.0,Provider,And some of them are just like.
11755.0,Patient,vendor one where they take a picture of us at the last day. yeah little momentum like hey.
252.0,Provider,you're healthy stay that way.
11755.0,Patient,"Or you can. Be proud of yourself yeah that's really sweet that that you did that. You know I have pictures from being entertainment and with my friends and whatnot. But that juxtaposition of the first day and the last day when you're like. You know, maybe the most over you've ever been in your life. You know feeling good and feeling ready and feeling solid."
252.0,Provider,But scared to death inside.
11755.0,Patient,Oh God. First.
252.0,Provider,"A totally saw that over and over and. You know, and being able to to really you know, try to walk through that fear you know walk through that fear with them saying you know what you just got to get up tomorrow morning. and start your day all you gotta do. don't have to do anything else get up tomorrow morning do your morning routine that you started in here. theory sorry gotta do."
11755.0,Patient,i've seen so many people think like i'm going to do 30 days and i'm going to be fine.
252.0,Provider,yeah i'm cured.
11755.0,Patient,and real life just hits you like a ton of bricks and it is not. It yeah pretty it's happened to me multiple times and.
252.0,Provider,No.
11755.0,Patient,"I had to have like. You know, I will say, even though i've relapsed multiple times I have built a safety net over these last seven years of people that have still been there for me and it's gotten stronger and bigger and stronger and bigger and I. have put effort and time into building that and. You know this time. It seems to be the transition I am doing so slow and so, just like the fact that I went right from that treatment Center to sober living, I have to give myself a huge pat on the back for that, because that and especially when I had my apartment still."
252.0,Provider,"You know you are under no delusion when you were in treatment that you needed more. You needed that's where you needed that accountability, you know. Totally and you're going to need that, for the rest of your life that's the great part about it is that you build these relationships in these friendships that are just lifelong. He can be freaking amazing you know."
11755.0,Patient,"I have, I mean. it's like I almost like I pick up. A few at each treatment Center. Sure, and. Betty Ford is the one where I have actually like really stayed in the next with the zoom calls. And I. that's what helped was that we could do zoom calls. yeah scattering and then having build your own network wherever you were we were still seeing each other so."
252.0,Provider,that's been.
11755.0,Patient,Really really helped.
252.0,Provider,"Because that's one thing that usually, when people leave treatment that they they just let go they don't go to meetings they don't. follow through with several people you know they don't do any of that instead of continuing to the building blocks for a life long recovery, they just stop or they put everything into work and forget that recovery needs to be a before everything you know."
11755.0,Patient,people that have stuck with the Betty Ford meetings that I go to there's a there's a. bunch of them that are about ready to have one year.
252.0,Provider,it's pretty Nice.
11755.0,Patient,"Here, since I was there. there's a little crew of them that that are getting ready to celebrate their one year. And I adore them and I talked to them regularly, and I mean they live in Washington Oregon springs, there are a couple in La that I do see regularly. Good like one of them in particular has become like one of my dearest dearest friends and she comes to the meaning that we have that at the sober living House every Wednesday, so we hang out every Wednesday, and you know she's in her early 30s or she's much younger than me. You just we vibe. Like we get on both alcoholics."
252.0,Provider,mm hmm.
