16349.0,Patient,"i'm. Pretty abruptly. I didn't like the way that he was. Trying to solve our problems. And I kind of freaked me out, so I just left without saying a word. And then. Back in April. During my first kind of almost psychosis episode. I called him I caught I caught, a lot of people I didn't know what was going on, and so I caught, a lot of like note friends that haven't talked to in years and I was like did you care about our friendship and they were like so concerned they're like are you okay. I called my parents and also I didn't love me. When I called I called my ex and I was like what are these you should even be all. And then I called his parents like thank God. damn pika. yeah I was not in the right state of mind. And then, my second psychosis episode which is the one that brought me to this clinic. But after that he came to visit my house to talk to my mom. She messaged me on instagram like asked me if I was okay. And then he wanted to talk in person, but I was like I don't want to talk to you in person like kind of time telling you like this and that. And I kind of just left it at that."
759.0,Provider,"So that's so how things left off. Okay, do you think you might want to message them we know like you know and just say like you've been on my mind, you know, can we talk, you know, like is that a little bit too much for you."
16349.0,Patient,"I think about it, but it's like well what's the point kind of like."
759.0,Provider,"The not all. Since he has been on your mind you know, like lately, maybe there's something that needs to be said, or maybe some closure that you need or maybe you just want to you know talk to him, you know because. This is not the first time you buy him up you know so maybe there's something to be said."
16349.0,Patient,yeah. He wanted a kosher. I just like I wouldn't know how to go about our conversation and. I wouldn't. I wouldn't understand what the point of the conversation would be.
759.0,Provider,"So it's kind of like why get in touch with him now but what's the point of the conversation now. But one thing we do know is that you missed some. New mess, the feeling that you get when you're with him, but do you want to do you have a whole bag, you can rekindle the relationship or what is that, looking like for you. Know okay. So. He just understand that the relationship is over, but you just miss them are miss aspects about him. Okay. So it's not so much like you want get back together with him it's just that we just miss you know things about him. Okay. Okay. How about. How long has it been, since you guys were together."
16349.0,Patient,Two years ago.
759.0,Provider,"Two years ago, and you haven't really dated since then. kinda kinda little bit. How did that feel to date other people."
16349.0,Patient,It was kind of cool to see like what else was out there. Like. Different personalities and like different upbringings. and other people's like relationship problems and. I felt less alone in my what I was dealing with and I felt very supportive and. validated like. Like. It happened and. Like i'm not crazy.
759.0,Provider,yeah.
16349.0,Patient,But I don't know like there's also like there's just so many different. aspects and. coming into like a new theme right like you don't want to bring all the experiences into new thing. So i'm not trying to figure out like. What exactly like. Do I want to learn. What Should I be doing moving forward. yeah like that's just kind of like the.
759.0,Provider,hardest face.
16349.0,Patient,"To be in between and. that's going to take a long time to figure out. i've had like a lot of conversations about like different parts of the relationship with different people and. I guess like my mind, is more open yeah. And maybe this is like a part of my growth. Maybe this is like what I meant to be doing like. As my journey and my life. I just think about I."
759.0,Provider,Think you're you're hitting the nail on the hammer.
16349.0,Patient,I think a lot of like. A future like what I should be doing.
759.0,Provider,"and your goals, you know that you have for yourself, you know, like, I think, when you focus in on what you're doing and what makes you happy or what's going to make you happy new feature that things naturally will fall into place."

And you'd be able to do fashion school, you know by can pay for it, you know so maybe in the meantime, you know, like getting a job that can help you pay for things that you want to do you know might make sense."

759.0,Provider,"You can do things like in terms of fashion itself, you know, putting yourself out there. But you might learn, if you want to learn more about fashion and design and stuff like that, then please do go to school, you know you feel like that's going to help you elevate you."
16349.0,Patient,yeah there are things that like I probably won't be able to figure out so. It will help to have some guidance. Like a part of me is like I don't want to waste my time. Like I really wasted like seven like i'm already 25 and. I just wasted so much of my life and. Maybe it's not always be passionate think so negatively.
