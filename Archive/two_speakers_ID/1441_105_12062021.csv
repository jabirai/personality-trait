105.0,Provider,seven minutes after.
1441.0,Patient,"Hello. Sorry i'm having some service issues. Oh, I tried logging on my iPad and it wouldn't work so. Outside or the services better on my phone."
105.0,Provider,"I on it, but so far good on my side."
1441.0,Patient,"yeah it was weird it just like. It were just logged me out and it kept saying, do you want to send the notification to zoom. Okay, was like okay."
105.0,Provider,"You want to take some time and think about maybe some of the things that you had. Some intentions, maybe for the week and see if anything comes to mind, you may already."
1441.0,Patient,"shouldn't be laughing but. yeah i'm really struggling with work. Ever since the. me meeting with the bottom, you know the boss people at the House it's been. it's been it's been tough. and"
105.0,Provider,Some of those symptoms is troubling you the most.
1441.0,Patient,"So i'm going to try and set this don't have to hold it. There we go okay. um. Well, I. went to work Saturday night. And I always go a little bit early and I have time to hang out in my car. Before I actually like walk in. and my stomach started hurting so bad like I thought I was going to. Ship myself put it that way. yeah and. I I I didn't catch on right away right like I was like oh gosh this feels awful what's going on. i'm gonna have to you know, find a bathroom and then it dawned on me like. Oh. i'm about to go to work. And my stomach is hurting really bad like as soon as I parked at the apartment like place where they live. my stomach started to hurt and it took me a minute, but after I kind of like put it together, I was like Okay, so I just laid my seat back. And I started to breathe. And I had to do it for quite a while like. really big breaths like. Talking myself like talking to myself, you know, like going to be okay. you're just going to do the best that you can do. And my stomach stopped hurting. And it was really great. And it was good that I recognized it, you know, like in the moment and I was able to take time, you know because I had a little bit of. And I was Okay, no but i'm definitely. Having issues with the passing out at home. My little kid. is sick, so it makes things a little harder. But Saturday nights are a busy night for me, I have a lot to do so, even though he was sleeping. I I had a lot of stuff going on, and I did try and get my charting done before I left the shift. But i'm. i'm noticing at work that i'm very distracted from the charting. I kind of always like find things that I can do, and that always like seems to be what I do before I chart. The other thing I think that's kind of difficult. Is there's a big huge part of the charting. That. I have to do at the end, like toward like the last hour i'm there. And so I was able to get all the charting done that I could get done. Earlier in the shift but. My patient woke up. Early and I wasn't able to get this big chunk done so, when I went home. i'm I made it a point to make some breakfast and I was like i'm going to eat before I try and finish this right. And I fell asleep in my food. Like I I, yes I I of course I woke up right away once I face planted into it, but. It was really like oh my gosh and I was like okay i'm I think i'm dealing with the being so tired from just working a night shift and. You know the passing out so i'm just going to go to bed, so I went to bed, and I woke up and was trying to work on it later and pass out pass out pass out. The timer the tomato timer um I don't know. For some reason i've I. don't know if it's that I have, like other noises in my house or something but don't always catch the alarm and. Or, I can when I do look at it it's like okay time to go back to charting and I was like I just was charting. I don't know that it wakes me up if I pass out maybe."
105.0,Provider,Oh okay.
1441.0,Patient,i'm having some issues there. yeah.
105.0,Provider,"So it might still be effective, but the timing. Of it right now might not be. That might not be what's needed later on in life useful but there's bigger bigger symptoms that sounds like that are. Presenting I had of that so So is there a sense that. You are able to focus easier when you're at the patients residents when you're there."
1441.0,Patient,yeah.
105.0,Provider,What do you make of that.
1441.0,Patient,"I know it's um. I don't know if it's that i'm like I am needed and I need to be awake and focused and i'm like nursing brains on. Or what but. I do notice that. I will zone out if I don't have anything. That I need to do. at work right like say my kids sleeping i've gotten everything I need to do. kind of like. get lost in thought right or like. Just realize that I let lots of time go by, like I don't know if i'm. I don't know what exactly. I also know that I put a lot of things in front of the charting i'm really procrastinating when i'm at work. it's always like I can find things to do, even if. Like i'm not prioritizing the charting if that makes sense, and I should be right. I am. it's always like well I should chart but Oh, you know what I have to wash all the supplies i'll do that you know, and I push off the charting. So I get a lot more done in a shorter period of time in regards to charting when i'm at work, but I do also. procrastinated."
105.0,Provider,But how often do you. Pass out once you're charting.
1441.0,Patient,at home.
105.0,Provider,at work.
1441.0,Patient,I don't I don't pass out at work.
105.0,Provider,that's interesting.
1441.0,Patient,yeah.
105.0,Provider,"And you think it's well, I have to be awake because being awake is still part of the job I stay awake."
1441.0,Patient,"I mean for a lot of reasons, you know it's like. yeah let's yeah there's a pressure that I put on myself to perform and. You know, do a good job and. yeah. And then I guess once I get home I that pressures gone I guess. It goes from being like. I don't know at home it's like I worry about oh oh I gotta get it done I don't want them to notice that I, you know didn't do it right away or or whatever, but at the same time. it's a different it's not the same pressure is when i'm at work."
105.0,Provider,"you're not worried about doing it. being caught in in trouble, maybe."
1441.0,Patient,"I do worry about it, but it doesn't it's not a motivating thing like when i'm at work, I think it actually. causes some of the past Eric contributes to it right. The pressure the i'm at home, I didn't get it done, I need to get it done pass out. So it's it's kind of weird."
105.0,Provider,"Well, the word that keeps coming up for me is i'm going to get in trouble."
1441.0,Patient,yeah.
105.0,Provider,I don't know if that's what it is for you.
1441.0,Patient,"Know it's a big it's a big thing, and I was actually talking to my patients mom about it because. She pointed out to me at work that she goes, you know i've worked with a lot of different agencies there's she's like and I always. She goes the nurses can be great she goes but. To put it, you know 90 you know, frankly, she said, your agency is not very good to its nurses."
105.0,Provider,"yeah and last time there was this alluding to that they will put the nurses under the bus, they will throw them to the wall."
1441.0,Patient,"So she was like I always stick stick up for my nurses. And she goes, but your agency if they can pass the blame on to the nurse, they will. And I was like yeah i'm starting to notice that."
105.0,Provider,"Well, you are making progress, but think about what you did in the car. yeah that's really worth. worth just lingering with reinforcing it because. you're paying attention to your body. piece."
1441.0,Patient,yep.
105.0,Provider,"What is it that needed to have been said to you and I don't expect the answer to come quickly, so you welcome to think it out loud and you know what What was it that needed to be said to you to lift this. This burden of having to be free from making a mistake that somehow you. You have to. Well, I think. and listening to you more permitted. To be human. And you were tortured. A kind of like a like I think it's like a dog having its nose pressed in I get this just the inappropriateness of of the parenting that you receive. It just doesn't surprise me that the response of the body would be so primal."
1441.0,Patient,know.
105.0,Provider,"That it would you know lose its continents, you know that it would. Pass help to options for and so i'm asking you know. spending time with. That history. That that happened to you. That this. This cannot be confused you you you survived it but but I don't know if there's all the parts of you that realize that you did."
1441.0,Patient,yeah no.
105.0,Provider,"You made it you made it and succeeded and prevailed, and that is also what's so beautiful about the human nature, it does want to express its healthy itself it does want that and look at how it prevails, even under all that adversity is really something remarkable. about how you have. survived. Until we can reassure the parts that are checking you out that saying it. And can see you as capable and see that you're not a little girl anymore. That you did that in the car that you, you remember to breathe and you remember that you can shift how you feel by changing your thoughts."
1441.0,Patient,"Right. You know it's very interesting because I. It occurred to me how. Since i've started counseling and we've gotten into all of this. That I do. Think of myself as younger than I actually am. Like or or a I see my. challenges that i'm dealing with is you know younger or whatever it is it's still. Very much tied into everything and. it's interesting because when I did fight I was like oh my stomach really hurts i'm gonna I really thought I was gonna lose it. And when I laid back and I just started to breathe, the first thing that occurred to me, as I was like. My brains not getting enough oxygen. Right like. Why is that, like so. I realized realizing just that. How. Hard my body was working to tell me something's wrong or you know. Show me that it's it's scared or you know, whatever it is, and. yeah I. Am very. Still wrapped up in it all a lot that my. I don't realize that i'm not in the same situations anymore. necessarily."
105.0,Provider,"Now all that is pretty predictable from from from my vantage point but this praise, it is still progress you met a potential overwhelm. me with new skills and you went in. And you had a repairing moment, because nothing catastrophic happened."
1441.0,Patient,Right.
105.0,Provider,"You were not trapped again you weren't victimized again not not that day, you have that new history."
1441.0,Patient,yeah.
105.0,Provider,let's spend a little time just pictures same kind of thing but it's time to. Even go to the car your car to get in to go to work. how you can be so gentle. And kind. To this younger self what reassurances and what is it. And maybe it's that she doesn't even want to go with you.
1441.0,Patient,I didn't work.
105.0,Provider,I you know what I mean I don't know. But. I think.
1441.0,Patient,"I don't think so at all, I think that is. Part of why my nursing brain or my work self is a little bit more functional is that. Did compartmentalize differently, you know."
105.0,Provider,"So that's fine, it has been adaptive to some degree, but hasn't been perfect. No, so what I wonder is just take a second and let's let go of any presumptions that we have about what should be in shouldn't be. Just check let's check in with this. fear. Checking in with that and a lot of times, it very much represents that younger self. scared. Can you check in with her just picture her and get sense first of just being a compassionate caring. family member with this part you're just be be tender that you are not overwhelmed by her that her fear fear is not too much for you just noticed that let's just start there. And just sort of imaging or you can say it out loud even hey heading into work, you were. kind of scared last time what's concerning you going in today, or are you scared are you nervous."
1441.0,Patient,Getting a very strong like. I don't like it because I don't get to do what I want to do.
105.0,Provider,fantastic. asked her what she wants to do.
1441.0,Patient,She wants to play and have fun she doesn't want to hurt. me.
105.0,Provider,about how old is she seen.
1441.0,Patient,Seven a.
105.0,Provider,"Okay, can you let her know that charting is for adults and that she doesn't she doesn't have to just start there."
1441.0,Patient,whoo okay. Never had this conversation with myself before which is interesting.
105.0,Provider,"ask her, she knows who showed up with the with all that charge and energy in the bells who like who was see if the little one knows."
1441.0,Patient,She doesn't know. i'm getting a like well I don't want to go but i'm not getting the same.
105.0,Provider,huh yeah I don't want to go. yeah I said she doesn't want to go.
1441.0,Patient,yeah.
105.0,Provider,"What is it like for you guys any to see that. The. kid doesn't want to go to work with you, what is that feel. For you. what's your experiences that."
1441.0,Patient,I don't blame her.
105.0,Provider,boring sometimes it's. dull and routine.
1441.0,Patient,"yeah it was like telling her, I was like I had to go to college, this is an adult thing you don't have to worry about it. You know, like it it, you know. it's just. I get the sense from her that she doesn't want to go, because she doesn't she just wants to do what she wants to do, but the fear and the terror doesn't seem that doesn't seem to be related. yeah I don't know why."
105.0,Provider,Okay. So. there's this. terror. How how old is that.
1441.0,Patient,i'm having a very hard time wrapping like. Like understanding it I can't see it clearly you know cuz I I very much get from a little girl that she doesn't like work but it's not tear inducing but there's still something there that's been activated but I don't know.
105.0,Provider,"So this is just stay there, and just notice that the additional element of. being watched and reprimanded and being judged. might happen at that house. What happens to the little girl."
1441.0,Patient,Okay. she's upset. She wants to make everybody happy.
105.0,Provider,So when you see her doing that.
1441.0,Patient,mm hmm.
105.0,Provider,"What is it that she heard was the reprimand What did you hear in your scenario just not what he over here, see the she wants to people ways."
1441.0,Patient,"she's really looking for like praise, I think. and When the critiquing. or criticism. It It is like a Oh, I should have I should have it's like I should have known I should have. Just feeling, really, really bad about ourselves. Like she's disappointed. she's fallen short. she's not enough."
105.0,Provider,"i'll tell her the truth. yeah there's another truth out there, not the one that she took on."
1441.0,Patient,yeah.
105.0,Provider,"It took you a minute, but you found it. What can you tell her."
1441.0,Patient,i'm struggling a little bit.
105.0,Provider,"Hard we're getting at the Center of something so. You might say, you know what sweetie. i'm not great at this either."
1441.0,Patient,"yeah I was kind of like you know you you're fine. You don't. I was about to say you don't have to worry about making everybody happy, but, as I was saying it. It didn't feel genuine because I think. To a certain extent, I still believe."
105.0,Provider,"I know. you're in great she may know what she wants so let's just go to her, she may have she may know let's see. me, maybe after hey when you hear. nasty not niceness out there, someone starts twisting your words and. Your you don't get to just be a kid. You might say, how can I help and then wait."
1441.0,Patient,She really needs reassure.
105.0,Provider,"and praise her not excuses or empty empty platitudes, but praise what is. about her that she likes the most and loves the most and that she most wants attention for, and she didn't get this. Is this very important. you're breathing. This reassurance bethany. And it's okay to give it to her it's okay to need it and it's okay to give it but you're not used to it so it's slow and."
1441.0,Patient,yeah it's really not. Natural. But it's interesting because I can give it to other people easily. and believe it. But. yeah.
105.0,Provider,we'll start there so look at her.
1441.0,Patient,mm hmm.
105.0,Provider,"And to the degree that you can do this right we're inching and slowly here. We can't commit to something we can't do so just find the truth, for you how much you can give in this promise, in a sense of."
1441.0,Patient,"I. yeah i'm. i'm not the best. At this, but what I can tell you. Is that. When. You get criticism. it's because. Other people have. Standards in and you might fall short but that doesn't mean. That there's anything wrong it's their standards. I see you and I know you have a good heart. are smart and you want to do the best job that you can do. But to some people, they might have different expectations, and you can only do the best that you can do. And that's okay. Just."
105.0,Provider,look closely at her. I want you to see what a crushed spirit. The light. The creative The funny the sweet. The bright. she's a little girl. Do you see her spirit her brightness her light.
1441.0,Patient,yeah.
105.0,Provider,tell her what you see and praise those things.
1441.0,Patient,there's just so much. But I know it's easy to forget. When you're in the moment.
105.0,Provider,"So remind her sweet pea, just in case, all this nonsense from other people in the things they value, let me tell you what I value in you."
1441.0,Patient,"and tell her good. And it reminds me of when I told. My patients mom. They started to cry because she was saying. She wants to be notified if i'm talking to my boss and. And, and what about stuff like that, and I said and I. didn't realize it then but I realize it now, I said. You know, if anything, I hope it is reassuring to you that I just spit this stuff out. and talk about it because I have nothing to hide, you know I just. i'm telling you because there's not trying to keep anything from you yeah. kind of like like, even though I may not have done it in the way you want it right. Like I really do you know, like. It was, I was actually kind of complimenting myself, I guess, in a way."
105.0,Provider,i'm being genuine and transparent and authentic.
1441.0,Patient,yeah.
105.0,Provider,So give this little girl some praise for being. honest.
1441.0,Patient,honest. and hardworking. and Creative. and genuine.
105.0,Provider,"want to make sure you can see her the town next the suspect, not so much Can you see her hearing what you're saying."
1441.0,Patient,yeah.
105.0,Provider,Keep gone.
1441.0,Patient,I think you're. Just super fantastic.
105.0,Provider,Now that's a seven year old word.
1441.0,Patient,"yeah like I. You just have overflowing. joy and and. gobs of creativity and imagination. And and. I really. admire. That. I almost want to say, like she's not jaded necessarily in a lot of ways, like."
105.0,Provider,So if someone's not jaded what are they.
1441.0,Patient,curious.
105.0,Provider,curious.
1441.0,Patient,"fearless she's not fearless, though. you're willing to try new things. open. Trusting."
105.0,Provider,"How is she responding to you, sharing these."
1441.0,Patient,she's kind of shy like I. don't know how much she believes all of it.
105.0,Provider,well. What are you going to do.
1441.0,Patient,reinforce it.
105.0,Provider,"How can you earn her trust. asked her or find a way to figure out how you can do that, how you can be believed, that what you just said something. She can take in."
1441.0,Patient,"I think it's gonna be. Like. Really, remembering to do this. Remembering are like. Not just today right like. keep reminding her."
105.0,Provider,"And just wondering, is there any part that gets energized. If it meant that she was trusting. And over flowing with joy. Any other part get activated. or start speaking."
1441.0,Patient,Do you mean like. my mind her of that.
105.0,Provider,"Well, you. Know i'm just wondering or another part and you would know it through a thought or a feeling."
1441.0,Patient,"yeah because i've had a few thoughts come up but. Like when I said. Like fearless and then it was like she's not completely fearless. It it was you know. That. Sorry just got heartburn really bad. reminders of the bad things like. That contradict. Like. Trusting people you know and. Being fearless you know saying those words that was hard, because I know she does fear and I know she doesn't. Trust everybody and. yeah."
105.0,Provider,"that's a burden. that's not her. That that's not her so let's stay here for a minute just linger a little bit longer with looking at her and see if you can identify. What protective it's probably a protective part and it might have just happen, it might be your body to get sick."
1441.0,Patient,That might be what we just heard from.
105.0,Provider,let's let me see if anything else comes up if this little one got to be overflowing with joy and trusting. and You would be there. Is there a part that gets speaking to you in some way. That wants to protect or something happens.
1441.0,Patient,"i'm not sure, but I think it's interesting that i'm standing very still observing and she's like always like dancing around. Like skipping in you know, like. i've always thought that's interesting you know, like just very free."
105.0,Provider,uh huh. And you're standing.
1441.0,Patient,Standing there. i'm just yeah i'm very you know.
105.0,Provider,Tell me more I don't know.
1441.0,Patient,"i'm i'm observant I mean I guess i'm watching her but i'm all so like. Looking now I guess. When he said, the body and I thought about how I just got heartburn. and And then I thought about this visual. image, I have of her. Just she's always so active. Like. When I think of her in a happy state like. You know, running skipping jumping dancing you know, like yeah just having fun and not caring and me. it's almost very rigid."
105.0,Provider,What is it like to be around her. Carol carefree nature.
1441.0,Patient,"It makes me feel like there's something. weird about myself like. It makes me notice my. Rigid force. You know. me just standing, it also is enjoyable to watch her okay be so free and. having fun."
105.0,Provider,What that part is right now. That you're speaking from the one that stands and just watches.
1441.0,Patient,Something just popped up. Which is. That. With my sister. she's always been a very. carefree happy personality and. She just trusts and she just. And I ever since. The abuse. I always. felt like I had to protect. Like a younger brother and sister in. Those memories are popping up.
105.0,Provider,"notice also their. sense of. It being a bit foreign like it's not you notice that it was like it's weird being me this way the Standing here this number, so you said something like that was weird."
1441.0,Patient,"Well, I think it's that being around people. Who are like my sister or like this little version of myself makes me think about how it's kind of odd. That i'm just standing there right and it makes it makes me think of my sister's wedding and how. I was dealing with a lot of thoughts like. i'm so glad that she is able to be this person right but it's be because of like my sacrifice get away."
105.0,Provider,"Yes, yeah. yeah okay. That part. protected them."
1441.0,Patient,yeah. almost like I don't get to be that way. I don't know if I just like it's almost like I decided. very early on that. I had to protect them.
105.0,Provider,"This weird part to move back just a little bit it's not you. It is very much a protective part. And with so much respect. It can be grateful to it, but just say listen, I just want to understand you better what all you have done. To keep me safe but I need to see you from a distance, I can't focus when you're so close, can you step back a little. not going anywhere. mm hmm. Now, if, as even with that little distance if you have enough unblinding from it, you can say. All right, listen. You standing there. watching. What would happen now. If that little girl had a chance to be carefree ask it, what are you afraid, will happen, what are you concerned will happen. feel feel your adult body. Really distinguished you. and your therapist getting to know, an important we haven't run into this protective part before not like this weird standing there. Without any. Fear it to it really."
1441.0,Patient,"it's very stoic. It. Not showing emotion. But it's. Very observant. very, very observant in a way that's. For protection. When I asked it. Its. response was I have, I always have to be look at or like myself or others could get hurt."
105.0,Provider,"What do you know about. Making sure. That. The little one gets to dance and be genuine. And playful and curious dance and skip. It still it doesn't know. What can you tell. You say oh. But hey did you know that remember you see me, I remembered the breathing I remembered. I moved the seat back turn the car off took a look at different parts i'm learning how to do that. I don't know what you did."
1441.0,Patient,"He gave me the. idea is. When I do. Like it, for example, this meeting. it's basically like well if you had. been more observant you would have been at this it's like a. Re it's reinforcing like you should have. yeah see this. Okay."
105.0,Provider,No. that's its job is only that.
1441.0,Patient,i'm in.
105.0,Provider,"Self like that's why you need me because you can't keep an eye out. The last piece, I want you to do is I want you to explain to that part."
1441.0,Patient,whoa whoa.
105.0,Provider,How old you are. That you can see. That you can move. Report fight run. quit higher do you are an adult that this frozen sort of stoic. came about a long time.
1441.0,Patient,"tagging mystic it's very. negative towards me. like it. it's basically like well yeah I may have come about a long time ago, but you it like reinforcing itself like. With the like. You might be 36 but you still need me. and honestly I think there's more. Coming up. in regards to my body and like exercise and. lady said carefree like oh let's Bourbon skipped in like it almost looks at it, as like a negative thing. And then I thought about well, I was a cheerleader in high school right so. What about that and. I was a teenager those that I think. I had enough of you know enough gumption rate to try it out and do it, and really enjoy it stuff but. So there was a period of time I I think I fought against it but. Honestly high school was the time that I. Like at the end of my cheerleading I started having my. The ptsd and everything cuz I was remembering that's what I started to remember what happened to me."
105.0,Provider,So bethany slowly lesson line in see you have worked hard here. For the hour and you've done a lot of really important things. Again i'm noticing. The energy that's present with this teenager. The GM here yeah. I i'm glad we've met the stoic. i'm really glad that we got to that part a little bit today.
1441.0,Patient,"it's yeah wow right like whoa. it's still like studying for a bit, but. it's it's making a lot of sense."
105.0,Provider,So later on. yeah go ahead to talk.
