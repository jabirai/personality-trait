3144.0,Patient,hey.
226.0,Provider,how's it going. hey good. morning guys. very quiet over there.
3144.0,Patient,Nothing comes to mind right now.
226.0,Provider,"Well, how are things going like fill me in on what's been happening since. The last man."
3144.0,Patient,"I think we've been getting along pretty good you know, like major arguments and stuff few little things here and there, but not really anything major."
226.0,Provider,"that's a good sign. So that's you know, obviously, you know as a therapist that's what I look for when i'm doing couples counseling now the intensity how often you're fighting how little you're fighting how you're working through arguments. So. It feels like you guys have made a lot of progress, what are your thoughts on that, like what are you guys feeling."
3144.0,Patient,I think so yeah I think we're doing better.
226.0,Provider,What are some areas that you still want to focus on do you think of anything.
3144.0,Patient,"Like. Nothing like I can think of like both of us wise and you know see we do my own stuff. Rebecca but. Even like my last appointment with Rebecca. It was you know, cutting it short, so I was like I feel like there's nothing really. wow about anything so."
226.0,Provider,that's always a really good sign and. How often are you meeting with becca.
3144.0,Patient,I still meet up with her every other week.
226.0,Provider,Okay alright cool. Okay So how do you how do you want to use this time like what do you feel. So here's here's my thinking so it's do we go like three weeks or a month is time.
3144.0,Patient,"Three honestly, maybe."
226.0,Provider,"So my thinking is like maybe. Spread spread it out a little bit farther. And then you know just use, you know, obviously use it as like a check in just to see where things are. If you guys are feeling at anytime you need to get in sooner. that's okay and do that okay. But, so my thinking is that we can start to spread it out, because really you know when when we meet there's. there's little stuff but it's not you know, like major big stuff man you guys are getting through it and. You find your way through it. You know, even if it takes a day or two or two days you're still finding our way through it, which is great. So. that's just like my suggestion. But how are you guys dealing with that."
3144.0,Patient,"And I think, like last time, I think we were. going to push it out like a month or month in a week or something like that and. We I know that we were doing like really good, and then we had like a rough patch there and then. I was like why don't want to push it out too far, the next time, because who knows. what's going on and even like the same thing with Rebecca. there's times, where. she's well let's let's try to do like three weeks out or you know push it out a little bit further, and then it's like whenever that week that I needed to talk to her the most that's like the week that i'm not seeing her and thing so it's like. It always seems like it's like I should have just kept that appointment kind of thing."
226.0,Provider,"So, are you a little bit nervous to like kind of stretch it out a little bit further."
3144.0,Patient,"And I mean i'm willing to like stretch it out further because I. don't want to like really. take up the time of somebody else that could probably need it, or anything. yeah and. So I don't mind sure."
226.0,Provider,"Okay, so as we enter the holidays like i'm checking in with all my clients around like the holidays, sometimes it's a really rough time for people, and so I want to check in with you guys around that like like how that is for you and, like what your plans are and. You know, last year coven now videos really with family just you know just the chances that we were dealing with, but like how are you guys feeling about the holidays coming up."
3144.0,Patient,"For me, I I feel Okay, and we are actually going to Florida to visit her mom in December. So. we'll be able to do that, for her and her mom mostly her mom wanted to see this going chiara. So I know that was like one of our things is that I felt like for seemed like for a few months I kept asking him and he was just always like on the fence about it, like oh I don't really want to go but. When we went up to Reno for was at St vibrations I don't know if I told you, or if we told you not or not, but. My mom was there, she just randomly showed up for like my party or something so it was like a surprise. At some point. Like I guess like my mom or Kevin they spoke or Sam just clicked in them and then said that he was going to come out to Florida, so that was like a shocker for me."
226.0,Provider,"wow. Okay, so it's something you're looking forward to doing that. yeah no."
3144.0,Patient,"I mean. To me it's more, the reason why I didn't want to do was. I didn't want to like deal with kilian being on the plane. it's i'm like that's. To me that's, the main thing is like. you're out how we could keep his interest, while being on the plane because he's so so active if he wants to get up and like look at everything and touch everything and not listen all that kind of stuff but. But I just figured I know her mom really wants to see killian and have him out there and stuff so I was like what kind of takes it away if I don't go because chart like it'd be kind of messed up to put kilian in that are carrying that position with Kelly and find herself. How she is most likely not taken, and then it just be out. Her up there by herself with her mom. And I didn't think that was really fair for. Her mom and killed him to see her stuff like that so."
226.0,Provider,"And so, are you guys going before Christmas."
3144.0,Patient,"we're leaving December 3 coming back the 13th for the 12 yes, the 12th I think it's a Sunday, but I requested the day after, because we're coming in kind of late at Sunday. yeah so."
226.0,Provider,that's like that's a good amount of time. You know that's. that's like I mean you can do some fun stuff. yeah what part of Florida again.
3144.0,Patient,it's. Close to Tampa.
226.0,Provider,"yeah I think you told me that okay. All right, and then what about like what about for thanksgiving, what do you guys typically do."
3144.0,Patient,"Up until I think last year we'd go visit our parents, like my parents her dad and her mom when she still living out here, and then I think last year. i'm going to take you saw my parents my parents are literally like 10 minutes away from us, not even that it's a few minutes away like right down the road and we just decided to stay home and just kind of have our own food and stuff like that."
226.0,Provider,Just just you guys.
3144.0,Patient,mm hmm.
226.0,Provider,yeah. Okay. So it doesn't sound like the holidays are stressful for you guys.
3144.0,Patient,"I mean, normally, it is, or at least for me because i'm like we gotta. Like stressed out kind of easily and overwhelmed because it's like we got to go here, we got to go there and then you know, like usually it was like. My dad would kind of you know, make. not really a scene, but just kind of get all huffy puffy and. You know, like everybody does dinner around the same time, and you know it's just everybody's trying to plan it and we've made it and it's like we got to go to three different houses. yeah we all in sacramento but still it's just. Really really exhausting."
226.0,Provider,It is hard. I was her dad.
3144.0,Patient,"And I wasn't really spoken to them that's. One of the things that like Rebecca she asked me she's like I haven't really heard you talk about your dad like. Normally, you would always talk about them and. i'm like I haven't really spoken to him and I do feel bad I was like one of the things I was like I kind of feel a little guilty that I haven't. Really spoken to him or called him, but I feel like the last few times that i've tried calling them or try to set something up to you know, bring our son over, and you know if you guys would say like you're keeping killing away from me and. You know all that kind of stuff and it's like I i've tried like at least two or three times to bring them over and there was always like some little excuse that he had so. You know I just kind of stopped, and then there were even times that I would just call them to check on them, and he wouldn't pick up the phone, so no PS something like he's upset with me or whatever. That the way that I see is like my dad is kind of like toxic and he's like really kind of like bad for me. Obviously I love my dad but at the same time it's just a pretty much took care of them, since I was. Like 17 like 18 years old, so doing everything for him practically."
226.0,Provider,Okay well. Now that's what it is right yeah. What about like Kevin with working weekends what's going on with that and guys doing okay around that.
3144.0,Patient,"we're doing good I mean haven't really been working weekends. I know, like since we went to Reno I didn't work that weekend and I can't remember the following weekend after that or ended up getting the vaccine and getting pretty sick and then I didn't work. Was sick. I don't feel good that was one of the things that kind of like. got on my nerves is like kind of upset me because I felt like he was just hardcore milking it but. Now that the first first couple days after it actually felt like I had the flu."
226.0,Provider,yeah.
3144.0,Patient,"The body aches and everything and then I had a headache pretty much the remainder of the week into the weekend and stuff. And then work that we can, and then I can't remember what happened Oh, was it after we go to the concert. I think it was that weekend, or we can, after. I can't remember but. I think that worked maybe one weekend. And then we went to a concert two weekends ago and then last weekend we just didn't work, but he I think he stayed the night somewhere. Out of town, so it kind of like I think that was the thing is that I don't think you really work the weekend, or he only worked like one day of the weekend, but it was mostly like. you'd go somewhere, maybe stay the night and then come back the next day, so it wasn't really the weekend, but I remember he texted me and he was like yeah I was gone my buddy this friend, but that. Was it kind of burnt out on overtime yeah. weekends and stuff and I was like. Completely shocked by that now like super super shock, but just kind of like really like is that really you telling me that, like are you really is this you texting me kind of thing, but I think I even asked why. mm hmm but. it's kind of nice to hear. That i'm I don't want to do it anymore. Completely but it's just I think definitely maybe try to do every other week or you know space it out to where it's not every single weekend."
226.0,Provider,yeah i'm more of a balance for sure yeah absolutely.
3144.0,Patient,Does I mean if I don't work the weekend it definitely reflects because. Our bank account is kind of low already and we just got paid.
226.0,Provider,"yeah. Okay. All right, anything anything else you guys want to go over that you feel would be important or pressing."
3144.0,Patient,"Not like in a bad way, I mean I was going to kind of bring up that I feel like we're working. better or more of the team as a team with our son."
226.0,Provider,"so good. So, in terms of like one person not feeling like they're doing all the work or you're on the same page like with parenting styles."
3144.0,Patient,"yeah I feel like he. Like that things that. Like with eating I know i've mentioned it a few times before, but I feel like we're kind of working more as like when mama said this or."
226.0,Provider,yeah.
3144.0,Patient,"You got asked mama first or what a mama tell you for certain same either way but. And then, with us. Just me and Kevin he's been doing the dishes more stuff like that. think it was yesterday, or I don't know if it was the time before that he was doing the dishes and. I feel like I haven't really been doing anything lately and he's done the dishes the last few times and. I think it was, and I did the dishes yesterday for sure yeah and and I did surprise you one one day, whereas like completely spotless light came on and it mentioned those. In addition to the dishes or anything I just kind of did it did it. I think I got them done. procrastinators when it comes to the dishes you don't have a dishwasher so kind of. takes a while. Also. I guess not really realize but. it's kind of back to wait to do the dishes the way that we do and have like a lot of dishes and do a lot of lows because our we're we're on a septic. So we kind of think that the amount of soap that's being used and water water is causing it to a tenant backup the drains and stuff like that."
226.0,Provider,"yeah. So how how has kilian thing been reacting to you guys like being on the same page, have you noticed any difference."
3144.0,Patient,"There up until I think last night. He was actually going to bed at like a really good time he was listening like before going to bed like we're able to kind of. explain to him, like Okay, you know you're gonna have to go to bed, you know do this do that and then us gas and to clean up all still kind of fights this cleaning up. But for the most part it's almost like thriving him because he'll ask for something it's like well how about you have your toys and then we'll we'll. sit here. And then he had ignores it for a little bit, but then he realizes that he was not going to get."
226.0,Provider,"he's asking for, because what we."
3144.0,Patient,"wanted to do. Was gonna have to tap into that but just just let her up. and So he's been kind of doing that in fact. All our dogs. and Tina listening, you know almost bing and there was. A better. Oh, I know what I was going to say like another thing of like us kind of working more as a team, I know that there's certain ways that like if we say it it's not the best reaction as a kid. Like, can you please put on your shoes like yeah you're being quiet, but. Right you're like asking your kid to do something that they need to do instead of saying you can put on your shoes now please or something. Right I don't know it's the way that wording stuff so."
226.0,Provider,"Because you're it's like. When you say. You know, can you put on your shoes it's like you're giving them an option to say no. yeah right so hey put shoes on we're out the door soon."
3144.0,Patient,"yeah. And then, also the same thing, like as if. Like we're. If we say, if you do this, then we'll do this or you can do that it's more again just the verbiage like when you do that, then you."
226.0,Provider,"Right yeah it's not a question it's a statement. you're not asking. you're not asking him and yeah. yeah okay good I love it it's great good to hear I love that you brought up all the positives Kara. really good. Okay, so you want to do like maybe what five weeks."
3144.0,Patient,So we can see. That thanksgiving time.
226.0,Provider,That shirt is so we can do the 18th or we can do this second of December.
3144.0,Patient,I think the second December wouldn't be too good that every too stressful for me right there yeah.
226.0,Provider,Probably about. What about November.
3144.0,Patient,So couple days before we leave. I mean the 23rd I don't mind doing the 23rd I just didn't know if. You can be available or.
226.0,Provider,I can do the 23rd.
3144.0,Patient,"let's see think doing. 30th like if there's anything like crazy going on this right before we go to stop this through it. Unless you want to 2030 Okay, because I feel like that we. Like a lot of preparing for me, a lot of stuff."
226.0,Provider,"To think about something new, because it's the time change so. what's the earliest you guys can do it."
3144.0,Patient,Since six.
226.0,Provider,"Okay, so I would have to do it at seven o'clock. hold on, let me think about this for a second. yeah i'd have to do that. hold on sorry. i'm trying to figure this out because we don't turn the clocks are back before."
3144.0,Patient,"Oh yeah on the Seventh, are you in California to or no."
226.0,Provider,So it gets really confusing because i've got people. In different times oh. My God so i'm trying to figure out.

226.0,Provider,yeah brilliant for couples counseling you have to have both of you guys here yeah. Because you know it gets weird sometimes.
3144.0,Patient,it's kind of like one sided.
226.0,Provider,"yeah it's like oh so and so said this and you're like wow. That shouldn't really be said with the other person here. yeah yeah. Definitely. Alright, so we've got you for November 22 at six o'clock."
