15608.0,Patient,i've had a really tough time getting out of bed.
498.0,Provider,"Okay Okay, how long has that been going on."
15608.0,Patient,"You know it's been a few months now i've explained like i've always had insomnia, so i'm really grateful for the sleep. mm hmm but it's like 10 hours, I can go up to 12 hours you know if I don't have anything going on during the day, which I don't right now cuz i'm I employed so. Okay yeah."
498.0,Provider,"Okay, tell me about your mood, are you feeling."
15608.0,Patient,Pretty down which yeah being you know diagnosis by poor whatever which one it is i'd rather be on the outside them on the down. and
498.0,Provider,How long how long you been in a downside.
15608.0,Patient,"Well, it started happening, the reason is switching medication happened is I started getting really bad anxiety. mm hmm and so that's why we switched it up, because I was on that vibrate ssri. And since weaning off of that I know it's still in transition, you know because I just started to list with them, but um. I don't know i'm grateful because the sexual side effects of gone away so i'm really happy about that um but yeah I don't know i'm just kind of in a slump and it just doesn't I don't even feel like i'm on medication is working for me. i'd rather have it."
498.0,Provider,Well week is this of your lithium.
15608.0,Patient,"If i'm correct, I think it was November early November like November 4 or something that I got a prescription so around that okay. Okay, so I guess it's not too long, I could be wrong with the dates, I really can't even keep track of stuff like that even. kind of. stuff i'm having a tough time with okay."
498.0,Provider,"Because I know sharing just refilled your lithium on yesterday, so I was just trying to. write idea now i'll kind of coordinate with our to to get a. Closer because it will, and the reason I ask that the first prescription of the lithium is what I see for most recently as yesterday. Unfortunately. lithium does have it does require some time. But it's it's one of those medications to where when you do reach like a therapeutic threshold it's it's unlike any other. Time is is what's, most notably. recommended in combination with lithium. completely understand your frustrations, in the meantime, you can be feel comfortable with continuing. To give it some time."
15608.0,Patient,"The other concerning side effects like so both my dad and my sister they have like tremors and lately like I can't even like put on mascara I mean, I can but it's like my hands are just like kind of shaky. And that. is really, really weird."
498.0,Provider,"Okay, thank you for telling me that, because that kind of segues into my next."
15608.0,Patient,Sorry.
498.0,Provider,No you're fine I love it when that happens. How long do you feel like you've been experiencing those tremors and is it like fine tremors like that.
15608.0,Patient,"Fine charmers yeah it's just when i'm trying like I said when i'm trying to focus on something and it's not like crazy but it's it's noticeable to me, you know, like like I said, like putting on mascara it's like like it's kind of shaky. Okay. Can I ask you something domini. Absolutely, so when so when the lithium does become in full effect it's supposed to help with depression like is it like a mood lifter."
498.0,Provider,"it's a mood stabilizers it's not necessarily a mood lifter. So it won't. increase your mood that's not how it works it kind of helps to mediate your mode. What often works in combination with regard to like bipolar depression. is like second generation and a psychotic like la Raza don't or things of that nature those working, this is the way that those two medications work, so you have your lithium that stabilizes you, and then you have another medication that like raises you to your baseline level."
15608.0,Patient,And that's the motor gene that should raise me.
498.0,Provider,"lamotrigine is actually another mood stabilizer so when used in combination with stabilizers to mediate your mood and and we can look at you know, making some changes nothing too aggressively because it all kind of require some fine tuning and slight changes. But before we go to that I wanted to look at your. Christian when was the last time you've had any lab work completed."
15608.0,Patient,Like a year and a half or even two years really. Okay yeah.
498.0,Provider,"Okay, and. I hate to be our introduction, but i'm happy to jump right in and get some work started with you ever like to order labs on you to see where your lithium levels are. Because that can help to determine next steps. that's first thing. And then, secondly, if it's not too much to ask, I like to meet with you again next week I know that's really, really, so you probably didn't anticipate meeting me and then having to see me again so some."
15608.0,Patient,Free shoot it rather than. The long range goals yeah.
498.0,Provider,"Good but i'd like to know exactly where you're living in levels are because it's wonderful as a joke is lifting is it has a very fine. range of fear bonds range of therapeutic level, so if it's too high. And they could call certain side effects if it's too low, you don't get any benefit, and then it could cause some other side effects like to know where you are with regard to that range. And, and then based on that I will feel more comfortable making a recommendation from the any before like to use the restroom often."
15608.0,Patient,"here's the thirst for sure, which is good, because I know I should drink water water but yeah waking up like super thirsty and. Is that what you asked her I don't know if I cut you off."
498.0,Provider,The first tip or feeling like you're using the restroom a lot.
15608.0,Patient,"Not not a lot no i'm not I don't know well, I mean in regards to using the restroom like this, I know it's common but like that first week I had the worst cramps in my entire life and like explosive awful diarrhea. And, like the kind where like I. It felt like when I lived in South America, like you know, like that wow I gotta go now. And then, since like even with my i'm not one to get cramps with my period. And my Professor awful same side effects, like, I felt like a recurring thing when I first started with the and that's just this. This one you know but yeah it's just like it's crazy cramping."
498.0,Provider,"Okay okay. I can. I would like, I said I would love to give it some time for you to really balance for your mood to really stable as. If, as long as you're in at the European range the fine tremors a beta Blocker will take care of that. Do you consume caffeine lots of caffeine regular caffeine."
15608.0,Patient,"I was, and I was feeling great the summer, but um no since then I maybe do two cups of tea and then you know I don't really feel like doing anything later."
498.0,Provider,Do you. Are you still do you still feel like you're experiencing the the GI upset.
15608.0,Patient,What was that.
498.0,Provider,"Do you still feel like you, are experiencing me upset stomach."
15608.0,Patient,"More right now cuz I am on my kids so I don't i'm not equating it with the medication right now. But it's very normal for me to have any stomach like cramping with my period but Sharon did say you know I should get checked in i'm at that age, you know 43 I should get a checkup on my you know women's stuff."
498.0,Provider,And if you if you continue to let me ask this are you taking the lithium with or without food.
15608.0,Patient,"Without and yeah I read the bottle and I first I just read it as like do one initially and then up the dose to two and then I reread it the other day, saying twice a day. And I haven't been doing that and also when do I take these I feel like i'm staying up super late and then sleeping and super late so what's a good time to take the medication."
498.0,Provider,What what time does your day start.
15608.0,Patient,Well lately it's like one or two it's like really.
498.0,Provider,Really late okay.
15608.0,Patient,"yeah, and so I take it, when I wake up, which is, if I remember like three or four you know, sometimes one when I wake up, sometimes you know."
498.0,Provider,And you're on a three milligram capsule correct.
15608.0,Patient,yeah.
498.0,Provider,You taking one will taking one twice a day so typically.
15608.0,Patient,"No, no. I haven't been taking it twice a day just I have been taking it once a day both of them."
498.0,Provider,All the 302 hundred.
15608.0,Patient,"Is it 600 total so then taking to the three hundreds, at the same time."
498.0,Provider,"Okay, so you're taking 600 milligrams in the morning and then 600 in the evening."
15608.0,Patient,No 600 total.
498.0,Provider,by the day.
15608.0,Patient,"For the day, but I take them at the same time."
498.0,Provider,"Oh OK OK OK, and is that how you were instructed to take it."
15608.0,Patient,"Well, like I said I think i'm she didn't mention anything that I did I didn't remember anything like that, but I reread the bottle and it says, take the second one to take to twice a day which means split up the dosage but I misread it the first time, and I just started taking two."
498.0,Provider,Okay okay.
15608.0,Patient,Okay.
498.0,Provider,"yeah because that's, meaning that your lithium your blood levels of lithium are on at a constant. it's it's you know bumped in the middle of the day, or whenever you're taking it and then it basically dies down over a 24 hour rotation and then bumps again. When the design is for you to take it, and then about 12 hours later, take it again, so you can just stay at this at this constant level, and you don't fall below it. And then, of course, that could explain some of the GI upset because lithium can cause some stomach upset. as well, and it can cause some fun term as in that does kind of answered the question of where where your lithium levels are I bet I bet you're achieving as a certain level of. of therapeutic grade and then you're falling well beyond that which could also explain why you're not feeling any relief to it at this juncture. Best best practices to regardless of what time your day starts and if it's starting late in ending late and it's best to try to take it at the same time around. To as a nine to 12 hours of your day is starting about 11am and you're wrapping up your day about 9am 10pm, then you can take it at the beginning, in the end of the day."
15608.0,Patient,mm hmm. Because those hours you're not.
498.0,Provider,you're not practical for you.
15608.0,Patient,Should I just set a timer and keep it by my bedside and just take it.
498.0,Provider,"That would be wonderful again only because I would really love for you to achieve the long term benefit of it, but I don't want. I don't want you to be in it for you know six weeks and then abandon it because you've already done such work with regard to getting to this point you're, you have the medication it's just a matter of getting the regulation going."
15608.0,Patient,"right that makes sense and how about the limo gene what time of day, should I take with that because, like I said every I think there are other stuff I was taking too, but. It really seems to help with my sleep, but I don't i'm not sure when I should take the day because I take it, when I wake up, maybe I should take it before bed like."
498.0,Provider,I was just gonna say it's totally fine if you take it at bedtime because of it sedate of effect so that's absolutely fine.
15608.0,Patient,"Because I don't feel like sedated what after taking us through like you know, like i'm ready to go, you know."
498.0,Provider,For the day. Does it give you a bit of an energy boost.
15608.0,Patient,"Maybe I mean yeah with me right now it's really just like the getting my ass out of bed. Okay, decent hour and like I can't put myself to bed at a decent hour because i'm waking up so late."
498.0,Provider,"i'll tell you, most people most people even myself I instruct people to take lamotrigine in the evening about an hour before bed it's good. I consider it a bedtime dosage because of its available fix in that way you avoid daytime sedation so if you're taking it in the morning, and it could also explain them exacerbation to regard to like your daytime fatigue."
15608.0,Patient,"I don't have a time for you to. Like it it's just went know like if i'm up i'm up. i'm just. Getting going, that is just like other worlds like I just can't."
498.0,Provider,"Okay, and that is that. Is that you characterizing your motivation like it's just hard for you to get started."
15608.0,Patient,mm hmm.
498.0,Provider,"OK OK OK, I understand that are you paired with a therapist or mountain Valley."
15608.0,Patient,"They haven't sent me up, I tried once to reach out and it didn't go through, because. The mountain Valley, people said I could get one through bright heart because I wasn't really happy not you know it's just. I want people more like focused on queer issues, and you know my personal background where. I know that's not important, but I just want people like kind of specialized and so bright heart was supposed to because I spoke with them and said I got the okay from mount belling right her was supposed to follow up and make sure that was Okay, and I didn't hear back so. So, to answer your question No."
498.0,Provider,"Would you be, would you be receptive to being a therapist with bright heart and then, if not valley comes through with unavailable therapist and you could take advantage of that one and let this one go will continue with both."
15608.0,Patient,I would prefer one i'd prefer to try one through bright heart and I did ask for like some sort of different specialization whether I can't remember you know just kind of. Somebody that uses different types of therapy.
498.0,Provider,"OK OK, let me ask you a follow up question. Is there any specific, because I, the only reason, this is me trying to pry. i'm just trying to get as much information as I can, so that I can just kind of assess if I can accommodate you are not because I believe in full transparency with me you kind of get with what whatever is the truth. No tell me, is there any specific. Therapeutic approach that you're looking for because I don't want to promise you something that we can't provide."
15608.0,Patient,"Yes, something like a something in because i'm a practicing Buddhist so something kind of with meditation involved or. breath work or something like that."
498.0,Provider,you're receptive to breathing exercises.
15608.0,Patient,I got.
498.0,Provider,A naturalistic approach distraction activities.
15608.0,Patient,All right.
498.0,Provider,"Okay i'm good news is is that most psychotherapists kind of include some of that approach. So I would feel comfortable. I will absolutely comfortable recommending it at least to the surface, that I work with its bare minimum. If it's okay with you. i'll let one of the care navigators know that they could contact you with regard to setting up an appointment with Lisa. One of the reasons that. psychotherapy is so important is because medication can only go so far. Right like when it when when the medication runs out when it has the door it's going to be, you know those innate skills that you learned how to recognize your signs and symptoms of your stuff early on. And then. integrate those skills in your toolbox, in order to manage you know things like your motivation more effectively, you know. you're fatigued more effectively and again medication is only medication is only going to mediate it so far."
15608.0,Patient,"Right yeah so thank you, I would love, if you could set me up."
498.0,Provider,"yeah absolutely well. So plant number one, are you okay on medication inventory like you okay on supply."
15608.0,Patient,Right now yeah I just need to pick up my words.
498.0,Provider,"Okay, and how about i'm going to reorder labs for you just so I can see where your levels are but i'd like for you to wait until. You have now that you have a better understanding of you know medication consumption, how you should be administering it I like for you to give yourself about 10 days of consistent consumption in a cyclic basis. And then get your labs done. Okay, and then I would like to see you and. 14 to 21 days, no, no, no more than that, but at least 14 to give time for your laps to get done after 10 days and then be read and interpret it. And then that way i'll get a chance to see them see where you are medication wise and then we can determine whether or not, if any changes need to be made at all okay."
15608.0,Patient,yeah.
498.0,Provider,You have questions for me concerns anything I can do.
15608.0,Patient,"um. It will that lab work test, I mean does it tests anything in terms of like serotonin and that kind of stuff."
498.0,Provider,"No, not serotonin levels it'll be a lithium panel and i'll also get like a normal lab study on you, with regards to like vitamin D levels CBC count your. sodium levels. Things like that urine drug screen. Just kind of normal normal labs."
15608.0,Patient,mm hmm.
498.0,Provider,But Sarah tone is not one that's included in that.
15608.0,Patient,"um yeah, and so I was I had been sober for like three and a half years, and the last couple months i've been drinking. And does that affect. I mean obviously alcohol affects everything but, like in you know in unison with the other like, is it really dangerous or anything. i'm."
498.0,Provider,lithium. I always try to inform my patients that specifically with lithium and there are lots of things that can affect. affect your medication levels. nicotine is one alcohol is another.
15608.0,Patient,I smoke a lot.
498.0,Provider,"Okay, I love I love the transparency in the room. But caffeine, is something that can cause decrease to your lithium levels. diuretics. Antibiotics fragile. Lots of stuff that can cause the levels of your medication. inserts medications that you may be using for like a headache. They can cause your lead levels to rise, you know suddenly to a level that you know isn't healthy for you. And then, of course, alcohol can cause you some dehydration dehydration also has like a direct effect on lithium because lithium works with like sodium in your body and where water goes sodium follows So there are a lot of components that are working against. Your therapeutic goal with regard to the lithium knows something for you to consider is. Reducing to elimination. Your alcohol consumption of possible certainly tapering your medication of your nicotine usage also. that's not easy that's not something I expect for you to quit tomorrow. If you just want some education on you can always call one 800 quit now. We prescribe nicotine patches there's nicotine gum that you can try just to see if that's a route for you to consider. it's a work in progress okay. yeah not a free fall. or tomorrow, but that's just you know some educational points for you to consider with regard to what else is going on with you, am I drinking coffee and consuming sodas. You know, am I consuming too much alcohol should I should I save the cigarette for later on today if that if i'm ready to do that. Just because all all of that contributes to your mood all of it. mm hmm, especially when you're you know you're fighting to balance it."
15608.0,Patient,"Right yeah. I mean yeah I, I want to, so I was prescribed wellbutrin. mm hmm and taken off of it because I thought it was it seemed like it was giving me really bad anxiety. Is it something, because I know it's prescribed for smoking cessation and it did seem to be helping like I wasn't thinking about smoking. Too much and like I would forget smoke a cigarette or something and I have a couple bottles that have you know our backlog of, and is it something I can like take just randomly or is it not good."
498.0,Provider,"yeah well you know something that requires consistent it's. it's a lot, like every other medication it's not an as needed medication. Right yeah."
15608.0,Patient,"Right and then I have been taking I normally don't, but it seems to work like taking the hydroxyl. When i'm having anxiety. And it's helping like I took it yesterday I just had like a really down day and I just was mellow all day you know which was nice. Are there other like things like just specific acute anxiety things that I could take that aren't scary."
498.0,Provider,"Other than the hydroxyl thing. hi jack says he would be the most acute thing. To take for anxiety, however. What else you can take for your hard drive I mean for anxiety even acutely and on a regular basis is propranolol it's a beta Blocker. It works by decreasing your heart rate in your blood pressure, just a little bit regularly it's typically prescribed for. tackle Kar Diya and high blood pressure, but because it it kind of acts those physiological effects it also works to decrease your anxiety so it's something that you can take regularly for anxiety for maintenance or you can take it, you know, during episodes of increased."
15608.0,Patient,mm hmm what is that. what's the.
498.0,Provider,panel it's a beta Blocker.
15608.0,Patient,"Okay, and that's the only name for it there's not like a generic mean whatever."
498.0,Provider,The just the generic is propranolol the name brand is endure all.
15608.0,Patient,Okay number. One all right.
498.0,Provider,"You can think about it. Think about it, some while. We you know kind of get into the swing of the medication kind of rolling like it should get your labs done. And then, of course, if you like, to take advantage of it, we can. I can prescribe it when we reconvene."
15608.0,Patient,Can I get a prescription for the nicotine gum.
498.0,Provider,The nicotine gum is actually can actually be purchased over the counter.
15608.0,Patient,"Okay, all right."
498.0,Provider,"You don't need a prescription for that. Right yeah. Okay, are you thinking about em using a gun."
15608.0,Patient,"yeah i've never done it before, but I think it'd be probably helpful I don't know it's it's yeah."
498.0,Provider,"i'm interested in how it works for you lots of people report great success, some people love it some people don't. yeah."
15608.0,Patient,"I don't know I it's kind of expensive to and I don't really have an income, right now, so I might have to put it on there, but cigarettes expensive shoes."
498.0,Provider,Good point good point.
15608.0,Patient,yeah.
498.0,Provider,Good point swap one for another at least one try. See you mean you never know you may pick up some gum and put down cigarettes. rehabbing now i've seen stranger things that seem strange.
15608.0,Patient,So isn't the nicotine itself so harmful part or is it just this looking.
498.0,Provider,"At well the nicotine gum debt note it's actually a little bit of both but what you kind of do as a harm reduction approach. So you to the nicotine gum in order to smoke a little list, and then you choose a little less gum and then you to a little escalate it works, a lot like that, with the patches as well. You start out with like a stage one patch. And then you go to the stage to patch in, then you go to a stage three patch it again it's not about just chew this government you're never going to want a cigarette. Yes, it's just so on, you know. yeah."
15608.0,Patient,"yeah I mean i've quit for years before I just it's like I started at once, I started taking medication actually I started like smoking cigarettes out of the blue. You know, and then I was sober for a long time, but then out of the blue, I decided to drink, you know I don't know that's why i'm like his medication right for me, because my normal practices meditation. And I haven't meditated for so long, I just. I don't know why I just so maybe that i'll talk to the therapist to put that."
498.0,Provider,"And then. I think you're right, I think, just. therapy and finding the right opportunity to get motivated and just putting one foot in front of the other not even thinking about you know meditation yet, but let's think about getting out of the bed at a desirable time today and then going from there. You don't have to work, it all out before. You know you even open your eyes. yeah yeah pebbles build a mountain."
15608.0,Patient,I love that.
498.0,Provider,yeah yeah. So I will make plans to see you in. Three two to three weeks.
15608.0,Patient,"yeah cuz I live in a small town, so I don't know I can get into the blood work when will they receive that in so. So I can call them."
498.0,Provider,"And i'll have them send it today, so they should have it no later than tomorrow, but you should get a notification once it sent. Once it's set, you should get an email that indicates that that it's been set for you so that you can schedule it at your convenience they'll just set it up, so that you can have it done. Okay okay."
15608.0,Patient,So that and then the therapist will I also get a notification about Lisa.
498.0,Provider,"Yes, i'm going to request that you i'm going to request that you're scheduled for an appointment with Elisa and then you should also get an email with regard to an appointment with Lisa as well Lisa peers, I can do is her name. um any other questions for me."
15608.0,Patient,"No, thank you so much for your time, I appreciate it didn't say anything."
498.0,Provider,Absolutely absolutely sending you lots of love and light in nature. And i'll See you in three weeks for Paula.
15608.0,Patient,My boys Thank you so much.
498.0,Provider,Thank you.
15608.0,Patient,here.
498.0,Provider,"it's me I should do it. christy. Is a. catty is a. 43 year old female with bipolar. Two disorder. presenting today from medication follow up she's currently on lamotrigine. 200 milligrams. should be taking Q hs even though she's taking it in the morning and she's on lithium. Big hundred milligrams. Big even though she's taking it both tablets in the morning. And she's on hydroxyl the 10 milligram tablets for. anxiety abortive therapy. patient is complaining of any of downward mood. Extreme fatigue. she's indicating that she's sleeping 10 to 12 hours a day also complaining of some. erratic fine tremors and. it's unclear if the patient is. benefiting from the lithium at all i'm due to. Miss miss miss administration. It may, it could just be something as simple as um. It could be something as simple as an. inability to rip rip repeat and reach and maintain therapeutic level. Just based on how she's taking it. Plans plan is to i'm have the patient going for laughs. Re evaluate. medications efficacy after taking it as directed and reconvening with her in three weeks for medication follow up. Recording stuff."
