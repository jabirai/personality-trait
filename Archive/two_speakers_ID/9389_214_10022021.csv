9389.0,Patient,Hello.
214.0,Provider,"what's going on, how are you. So where we are with the occupational therapy."
9389.0,Patient,"I think going twice a week it's been pretty nice I think my back stronger now. yeah so it's it's been helping me like with how i'm sitting. A bit and. I learned this week, this Wednesday there's like a specific point in my arm like when being robbed that like really, really hurts and then i'll feel it up in my hand and so. they're kind of like okay let's focus on like that a little bit and exercises to strengthen it and to stretch it but to not over. By do it at the same time. Okay, so. it's been fun it's been interesting."
214.0,Provider,"Okay, I mean do you see an improvement, or not yet."
9389.0,Patient,"You know it's hard to say I want it, yes, there is like there's value in going into it, and so I do appreciate going I can't say like everything's peachy and it's fixed everything. Because it hasn't but i've also not taken the time to go back into old habits of drawing again in order because, like i've avoided, you know a lot of tasks and I continue to avoid task to prevent. pain from coming, so I feel as though, in order to know how well it's doing i'd have to put my back and."
214.0,Provider,"I know, but we are, we are do we think this is a good idea."
9389.0,Patient,I don't know.
214.0,Provider,when's the last time you had your vitamin D levels checked.
9389.0,Patient,"I don't know, probably the last one I got into the hospital, maybe I don't know."
214.0,Provider,"i'm just i'm just curious to there's a new. New study out that that's confirming that the vitamin D deficiency are for people who have pain, increase the pain and if we can. stabilize and maintain the vitamin D level pain will decrease because vitamin D is an Anti inflammatory it's just a thought i'm just trying to figure out what else we can do on top of what you already do would be. You know, occupational therapy."
9389.0,Patient,yeah just. What is their food as vitamin D or do I just need to go outside.
214.0,Provider,So So there you go or you take a vitamin.
9389.0,Patient,"Okay, we did have the vitamins that I made Chris really sick. Good D yeah. What what did What did it do. think it made them gassy or something like Tommy upset. There is something. and especially there's like some few people have an issue with it. So he's like well."
214.0,Provider,"I mean, I obviously has a negative effect you shouldn't take it, but I mean, but you know I wouldn't take it unless. You know I know it was safe to take even though it's a vitamin doesn't mean it's safe to take you know we don't know what the body will do, but it's just a study. That deals with pain, they found that these pain patients actually respond extremely well to high high doses of vitamin D, because the levels are so low."
9389.0,Patient,So what would you recommend.
214.0,Provider,"I would recommend I mean when when's the next time you're going to do, like a physical."
9389.0,Patient,hold on my computer like shut down nearly. Only thing freeze on mine.
214.0,Provider,"Yes, very."
9389.0,Patient,"Short, it was it was like a very long time was like oh no it's doing a thing. And, just like I can't communicate to you because, like the screens just go black, so I was waiting."
214.0,Provider,"I know you're fine, I would just say next time you do a physical you know tell you, Dr you want to do you know I want to do a complete lab work up and make sure you're in the range."
9389.0,Patient,yeah. yeah wouldn't be smart to take supplements if.
214.0,Provider,"We like you don't know what you're deficient in on that deficient so you're not deficient, why would you take it there there there's no harm according to studies. To take it, because vitamin D just replenishes on his own because of lack of sun right so automatically no one really monitor maintains a good level of vitamin D just because of the sun. So they're always saying to booster and maintain you know the levels, but I would definitely refer to the doctor when you're ready i'm just saying that the study concludes that it helps with pain. And if you're inflammatory if it's inflammation this would definitely help. Why don't we leave it for the trip."
9389.0,Patient,Monday at three in the morning.
214.0,Provider,What are you taking a cargo plane.
9389.0,Patient,"hey there didn't want. I don't know I wish we we left on like Sunday night, so we could stay the night there but um I guess the CEOs like I try to be as efficient as possible, like get there, get there in the morning and then we'll book and the hotels after it's like."
214.0,Provider,"No one's going to be able to participate in any meetings, because of the three o'clock flight in the morning. Like penny wise, pound foolish isolated but anyway well alicia going without."
9389.0,Patient,"yeah i'm not. Okay, so if i'm tired, I mean i'm just that song."
214.0,Provider,"No that's my point like. Trying to be efficient, is like okay like so we're moving everybody's clock around yeah that's not efficient but anyway um anything else know the gas leak taking care of."
9389.0,Patient,taking care of Christmas so scared I do not blame him.
214.0,Provider,But he's got the meter right he's got the meter he can.
9389.0,Patient,"Use Yes, he does."
214.0,Provider,"have them, you know long as the meat is not going off, he should bank on what about the marijuana."
9389.0,Patient,Smoking yesterday.
214.0,Provider,So is it less often.
9389.0,Patient,"it's less often and it's not as strong but it's still creeps around and it's like at what point is like okay today's a bad day I should report them, whereas the like well it's not as bad as last time I don't know I haven't smoked it today."
214.0,Provider,"I mean listen they're still doing it they're doing it less, but that doesn't mean they're supposed to be doing it less it doesn't save you smoke less we're good with that right, it says no smoking so it's a decision you've got to make."
9389.0,Patient,i'm not good at making sure.
214.0,Provider,"I got that. I got that. Any new stresses or work Oh, the same."
9389.0,Patient,"i'm the same we got a new co worker new person. i'm on our little digital team, so instead of a team of two it's a team of three."
214.0,Provider,"And I, are you going to appropriately, let them do what they're supposed to do it, you can add it all up and want to do it all yourself."
9389.0,Patient,I don't. Like if you could say.
214.0,Provider,There you go that's what you gotta do give it to the person on the totem pole.
9389.0,Patient,"Particularly was saying, I just know a little more I guess that."
214.0,Provider,"Oh, but I mean they started up you so that alone yeah all personnel hi how's the medication working are still doing what it's supposed to be knowing."
9389.0,Patient,It is yeah and I think my theory is right around like my whole the cycle and then there's a part where it's just it dips cuz there's this point i'm like is this even working like I don't even know why i'm taking this and then after that's over it's like oh yeah no this weekend.
214.0,Provider,So during the cycle it's not working.
9389.0,Patient,right before.
214.0,Provider,So what do you have three four days off.
9389.0,Patient,Like three.
214.0,Provider,"Months you can go live, I mean. The open the open lines on a weekend but that's not the way it goes."
9389.0,Patient,"yeah i'm very glad that it's not going to land on this weekend this trip, you have no idea, like, I saw in Chris like i'm gonna be so mad. I don't wanna I didn't know unpack all this extra stuff and like creep until the plane bathroom."
214.0,Provider,I know. So it's Chris going to. Know oh.
9389.0,Patient,"Yes, it sounds gonna watch."
214.0,Provider,You can do about that has he been.
9389.0,Patient,"he's doing all right he's he had a bad day yesterday with work he was very stress. Oh yeah I guess the CEO is like we need to make 3 million more dollars, by the end of the year and it's all a new guys so it's like well that's not stressful but also kind of diminishes like all the progress that we've made this year."
214.0,Provider,Right right. that's a deflating move. Okay. how's the family doing mom dad.
9389.0,Patient,"My mom's birthday was yesterday. Oh, my brothers are the best as far as like hey we're getting mom this do you want to split with us it's like yes."
214.0,Provider,"Okay, good."
9389.0,Patient,"There, on top of that, and they picked it up for her and she's very happy she has."
214.0,Provider,"shown me any more talk about holidays or is that, like cloud itself."
9389.0,Patient,"No it's I. think we might try to do thanksgiving as possible, maybe. I have, I told my mom because it's true I get a lot of stuff that I, or I can grab a lot of stuff from the office when I go in, just like a bunch of random Hello kitty merchandise and my mom's a teacher and she like."
214.0,Provider,"Oh, what a perfect thing."
9389.0,Patient,"yeah she teaches special ED and like good behavior and you know, doing the right things, blah blah blah they get to pick something from the treasure chest. So I was like I like we have so much crap like do you want some she's like yes everything anything and like I mean flushes get like really everything anything, it could be a pencil whatever."
214.0,Provider,So good okay very nice okay good.
9389.0,Patient,And I found this cute little advocate and it's like I think that would be perfect like it's pretty stimulating.
214.0,Provider,"Okay, good."
9389.0,Patient,"But I have all this stuff just waiting that I need to deliver, and then I found stuff for my brothers they're like oh Sunday, so I got that so it's just like a pile of sanrio stuff shoved in a corner, that is like a reminder like I gotta give these things so everyone."
214.0,Provider,"yeah okay I. But it's a good thing you know the last 18 months haven't been things or thoughts, like the salt embrace the moment of enjoying your family. How they enjoy you being able to get them stuff especially moms especially teacher so that's that's super cool I think that's really, really cool I think that's important. I saw your your your we already said next week, nothing."
9389.0,Patient,Yes.
214.0,Provider,"Right Okay, so let me just look at this crazy calendar. And we already booked for the 14th."
9389.0,Patient,"on sex, but i'm going to say you."
214.0,Provider,"know I. had to we had to have agreed to that because it's in your town, but I I can't put things in saying like oh she'll just figure out she supposed to show up that day we usually talk about."
9389.0,Patient,14 730 I know we put something I just like.
214.0,Provider,"I, I just want to make sure. Regarding depression, what do you think that is."
9389.0,Patient,Depression like its existence or.
214.0,Provider,yeah with you.
9389.0,Patient,"I know it's a lot better, and I know it's a lot more manageable there's a stage. Where I I would look back a lot and be like I remember, being a lot happier like I remember like going through the days like some days in high school like people always called me like really cheerful and, like the cheerful person i'm always smiling and. The past few years, I would always think back to that it's like I don't know if that's true or not, or I just I don't feel like that was me or is it's definitely not me now. But there are times now I catch myself like sitting in the car, just like driving like i'm in a good mood i'm happy right now and it feels like. The time back then, so I think it's I feel like i'm kind of talking about a bit like I feel like it's under control."
214.0,Provider,When we say under control what would make it out of control.
9389.0,Patient,"hmm. I don't know I maybe not being able to talk not, I want to say the medication probably is helping a lot but. I don't always want to say that I completely rely on it, but I would be a fool to not recognize it. I do think that. i'll catch myself like in stressful situations, just like around the House where Chris will be like this is like everything's wrong and i'm like it's okay we'll fix this will be all right, instead of like me just completely shutting down to begin with."
214.0,Provider,"Then. So then, just just hear me out, so the intervention and intervention is continuing the medication we we believe that's assisting us number two is the other intervention is realizing we should we should recognize when we're happy. yeah like because what will happen is it's like I don't remember the last time i'm happy and it's like yeah because you don't tell yourself. So therefore if you're not happy with the opposite on happy unhappy Ryan will start to think that every day becomes unhappy when we're supposed to say man, I feel good today and it's Okay, if tomorrow, but not feeling the same way, but. Just be conscious about saying it like yeah i'm in a good mood."
9389.0,Patient,"yeah hey and I see those days, a lot more than I used to like the past few years and. And there were times to like i'm like we'd go to an event that I was really excited about and like loving every second of it but there's always like this. something wrong is going to happen, like I don't know why, but I feel like I shouldn't be enjoying this, but I am but there's like this weird teetering like thought like. I don't know. This happiness isn't deserved or."
214.0,Provider,I mean that that but but but.
9389.0,Patient,It makes it harder to enjoy it what's happening.
214.0,Provider,"Now I get it, but remember you've conditioned yourself over the years to to believe, like you know I don't deserve anything, or you know life life is hard because that's what I deserve like you do the the the guilty thing like you're guilty of something, therefore, this is your punishment. And all i'm saying is. Listen we've been seeing each other for almost a year it'll be any January it's a year. So I just want you to be reflective over that year, looking at your growth seriously. We came into this not so pretty and we're lining up for it to be almost pretty every day. So embrace that and that's about you, I know you know we we add the medication, but if you don't meet the medication where it's either you don't. continue to see me and you don't continue to challenge, some of the things that are going on in your life. Things will go back to the way they work so because you incorporated all these things, your intervention was medication see manny. Let me take a look at what's really going on before you know I get upset by the end goal and my Shell and just hide about things. Like you you're really blossoming very differently, because you're putting all these things together, I think that's why you're seeing the outcome that you think. For sure for sure."
9389.0,Patient,"I forgot, I was gonna say. I think the motivation at first was like i'm. Like when I started like this is, you know as not been working obviously i'm where i'm at and like. I want this change and all try again and do what it is, I need to, and you know just like. I just put a foot for and give it the old college try."
214.0,Provider,"But, but we did remember. that's important what it's been taking place is not working, I need to figure something else out, and that means me being committed. To whatever right listening to whatever absorbing whatever and you know i'm not i'm not saying your whole world is changed completely but it's definitely severely improved you've done a 180."
9389.0,Patient,yeah.
214.0,Provider,"yeah so you need to remember that I don't need to remember it you're doing all the work but, like you, can't forget that you can't forget that this dedication got you here and any slippery slope on the hill i'll put you right back where you were in that's what we want to avoid."
9389.0,Patient,"Right yeah. I agree, but it's also good to be like, even if there is some kind of slippery slope that it's been managed before and it can be managed again."
214.0,Provider,"So here you go that's another big one right, although I may fly a little on the hill i've seen this before I know what to do now, I can gain traction and go back up the hill that you didn't have a year ago. yeah right so just like really take a moment to embrace all the hard work you do, because it wouldn't it wouldn't be this way. Or you wouldn't be where you're at today, not only in your relationship, how you feel about yourself how you feel about everything else, your dedication made this happen so don't. You know, like not give it credit you got it like to give some accolades to the hard work, you put into it."
9389.0,Patient,Thinking about it. praising myself for doing things because my first thought is just. You you did it you hope.
214.0,Provider,"ya know but but. Very simple I can bring the hospital water if it doesn't drink it, it will just finish right, so I bring you things and you like oh and that's like oh I don't know, maybe, and then you take it, and then you run with it right. Okay team effort, yes, but you're doing all the work. So I would hope that you know every once in a while you just go like damn I now this but I can't go pack that's the key here. Whatever we've been doing has to continue for a while now, and needs to continue for a while longer, and then we can figure out what we're going to do, but everything has worked. Very seamless your relationship with Chris has improved, like so many things have just improved and and think about it at the worst time. During coven this is when everything went like a rye and sour now it's like it's not so like really think they take credit, you need to need to embrace credit, because if you wouldn't have put in the credit I don't know where you'd be."
9389.0,Patient,Oh no.
214.0,Provider,"I know, but we know we know where you are today and that's a good place. Okay."
9389.0,Patient,Thank you.
214.0,Provider,"you're very welcome, so I want you to enjoy that plane right at three o'clock in the morning i'm."
9389.0,Patient,"Not gonna sleep, and I know."

214.0,Provider,"Oh that's just the word. But enjoy it, I look forward to hearing about it i'll see on the 14th at 730 if you need me, for any reason, you know you call the virtual clinic. You tell them, you need to see me they'll get Ahold of me right away Okay, thank you you're welcome and have a safe flight and i'll see you when you get back."

214.0,Provider,"Right, I did I mean I had to come on so kind of class i'm basically ready for comatose state. You know. But I wanted to be able to talk to you before the show, but I thought for me and for us those employing."
9389.0,Patient,"The only person, you talked to you."
214.0,Provider,"know I had to other people I put him because yeah the similar things they're going to travel and we've got to make these appointments when we go to Santa schedule, because we know we stand schedule, we see the positive outcomes, we know if we ought to schedule it doesn't do. Well, so I thank you for realizing it, but I am. Fine, I mean okay."
