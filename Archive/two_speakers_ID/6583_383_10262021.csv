383.0,Provider,How are you today.
6583.0,Patient,How are you.
383.0,Provider,pretty good been raining like cats and dogs.
6583.0,Patient,just written down here too yeah.
383.0,Provider,yeah have you been enjoying that.
6583.0,Patient,it's always a relaxing yeah.
383.0,Provider,yeah finds out the change. So how have you been.
6583.0,Patient,been all right still going through ups and downs throughout the weeks.
383.0,Provider,"well. Where would you like to start, do you want to review the goals we were looking at first, or when do you feel like you want to run a would you like to begin."
6583.0,Patient,"actually did have some topics or thoughts throughout the week that I kind of recorded down. And just felt like maybe I need to discuss about them. Okay yeah. I guess i'll go chronologically actually. Actually, the album i've been talking about that, and like working on. yeah I actually recently released it, so I put it out to the world, I got done it was just a really long process between the. The moment of finishing it and uploading it to the you know, like spotify and those kind of platforms. I didn't realize that it would take so long, but. It was just yeah just took a while, and so I put it out there and then like yeah let my friends see it, you know. And I think. I think, for me it was scary because I knew that, for me, I came into it with my feelings, you know. And there weren't bright feelings, I would say, you know a lot of like you know the mood and the tone to it, but it was actually like I think people. I guess, I felt better knowing like the people there are some people that reached out to me, I was like oh. it's people received it positive you know you know, and it was like. It made me feel like better. To be like Oh, I can I feel like I have more confidence to be myself, you know but. yeah. But I think on the flip side is the struggle, you know it's a struggle of like. Now i'm kind of in that mind state, and this, I think this affects everything else that we might talk about today, but it's just kind of like now, is it feels like a bigger thing for me internally, you know as in like oh Now I want to be. Now that this is done, like. I feel like my mind's only been put to like now, I need make something even bigger and better. You know kind of like almost a pressure. externally and internally it's like. it's like all I care about and at the same time. And i'm pretty sure you can kind of maybe relate to these feelings as an artist, or just like are these people really telling me like the truth. You know, like. Do you really like like a you know it's like this is like really good This is like actually good you know, and I hate that I had to question it, you know it's like I felt good I felt like validated."
383.0,Provider,"You know, but."
6583.0,Patient,"In a sense, it's it's like i'm going through the process of like i'm almost kind of like picking up my validation like. Trying to see something with it, you know how real is it how how true is it like it's like best side of you know. Self criticism and the Dow."
383.0,Provider,"Right right right. yeah and so you've got that you've got validated and then, but then you kind of were like I don't know is that really is it really good. And that's what I just heard you describe and one thought that comes to mind is. You know it doesn't really matter what other people think, even if they think it's good or not good. You know what what's most important is that you feel satisfied with it, that you like it. And i've had heard this from other artists that are really you know now like quite well known that I know is that they don't look at reviews they don't they might hear about it, you know, through the grapevine like. Oh they'll hear that they got a good review, but they don't read them. Because they don't do the art for getting. people's approval or. or whatever, or the critics, you know. They have their own standards for it and they they they look at it. to please you know, is it good is it a good enough for you. In a sense. So what do you think about that."
6583.0,Patient,"yeah it's a good reminder, you know and it's like. Not to really and i've definitely said it before to you know just kind of relax and the way was like I shouldn't be caring about whether it's good or bad, you know. I guess i'm just still very young, in that sense, whereas like I have no. You know, basically virtually no reputation in terms of like who, I am as an artist right i'm still in the baby steps of like Okay, I need to like have a portfolio at least of who I am and then we can go from there, you know. So it's it's really hard because. I guess i'm overthinking it, I meant in a way, where i'm very hard on myself I compare myself to all the people I respect you know and it's just like. it's it's hard because i'm just that that infant and then to compare yourself to people were just like way you know, in terms of their experience older. and have way more experienced the hands on experience and i'm just like. But it feels like nobody will give me a time unless I myself can prove that I can be at that level, you know. As i'm very hard on myself. And it's just and also as it's like the reality is like I do want to. I think we talked about this before too it's like. The idea of like. That picture of fame you know just like. Well, what what. How do I get people to listen, you know."
383.0,Provider,Right right.
6583.0,Patient,yeah well meanwhile i'm finding myself like i'm just like whoa at the same time I don't want to make us to like look at me and then I give up everything that I stand for personal.
383.0,Provider,"Right right, I think you can hold the desire to be recognized to be listened to, I mean people don't make art, so that it sits in the back corner, you know and doesn't get seen or heard, I mean the point of it is to share share it, so I think it's it's um you can hold. This desire to be. recognized to be seen to be heard. As well as. Know you're not doing it just for that you know, maybe I mean I don't think you are doing it just to be recognized you're doing it because it's what you love to do and what you find it really interesting. I don't, so I think that. Wanting to be seen recognized heard that's that's part of part of it, you know. And maybe Maybe you can lighten up on yourself a bit you know what if you woke up one morning, and one of your pieces was liked by a million people, or something like that you'd probably feel pretty great. You know it'd be probably really, really, really awesome and. Because. Like I said, like the artists supposed to be shared and. If you think about just I don't know I mean i'm looking at like an old old famous bands, like the Beatles or something like that, and they were massively famous and. Many, many, many and and because it because it's really cool we use it, and it was different, and it was great and we still listen to the Beatles and why shouldn't you know, millions of people hear it, because it's good stuff. Right yeah I don't know how that makes it that if that corresponds to what you're saying or not, but."
6583.0,Patient,I think taps into yeah my feelings.
383.0,Provider,Okay. Do you want to share with me your spotify. album so I can maybe take a look at at some point.
6583.0,Patient,yeah sure um artist named should be Patrick trance tra and see. Okay i'll be tired or is a break.
383.0,Provider,"So okay so that's that's pretty cool that you change your name to Patrick trance. I like that. te ra and see. Battery Okay, there you are okay, and then. So OK. OK me now can any I mean, how does it work to put your stuff up on spotify."
6583.0,Patient,"yeah the process is simple, it just takes a long time, as in to kind of fill out application in a way fill a form put in, obviously the song titles and the genre the year. You upload your music and then, once that process is done which honestly takes like 15 minutes, then it takes like a three week process because it needs to approve it and moderate your submission."
383.0,Provider,"I see I see yeah okay. What now, how do you feel about sharing one of your pieces in group just even I didn't know if you have one has kind of shorter piece like three minutes or something like that."
6583.0,Patient,yeah um.
383.0,Provider,"Or do you feel like maybe, would you be willing to just say oh I just uploaded my album to spotify, and this is the name if you're interested to listen, then people could go on their own."
6583.0,Patient,Sure yeah yeah I might be better.
383.0,Provider,Okay yeah so then that way yeah it's not like we're all like an audience sitting there listening to the song and.
6583.0,Patient,yeah.
383.0,Provider,"Okay, so um so when you're in group. Are you okay with me saying you know, one of our Group members has something you guys have made some. Progress or has done, you know done something recently that they're feel kind of good about and and then then i'll let you describe what it is."
6583.0,Patient,Sure yeah.
383.0,Provider,"I think that that you know I appreciate you being willing to do that just because I think that you know people like to know that other people are doing stuff and having successes or you know even just. The courage to put something out there and and or or talent, and so I think that that's, thank you for letting letting me introduce you and share this."
6583.0,Patient,"yeah sure thing I beg you, for encouraging me to do that because uh I mean you can tell by my demeanor i'm still very timid. About that stuff you know and it's something I would like to work on, because it does tie into the fact like it's just like there's that's, the only way I can get my art out of the corner and to the world, you know, I have to actually talk about it and say something."
383.0,Provider,yeah right right yeah. So how have you been doing with just nuts and bolts stuff like the sleep stuff and waking up a little bit earlier and meeting those goals that you had.
6583.0,Patient,"yeah i'm still working on it, I think in terms of compared to two weeks ago i've been. waking up earlier, not a but more like around 10 which means is pushing back this little by little i'm still sleeping like. late. But not as late as like three or four consistently. Previously now it's like one, two, you know so it's just getting that balance and pushing that schedule back further and further to where I wanted to be."
383.0,Provider,"Okay, so you mean you're going to bed one or two type of thing rather than three or four. yeah yeah. I think that Ben time wake up changes when bedtime changes. So right yeah. How are things going with your dad and and just at home."
6583.0,Patient,"that's going all right he's he's going back to work, because we don't have unemployment anymore, so he says going away some. restaurant job. Other than that, I think he's just kind of getting used to that scheduled him not being home. not really buying anything changes because he's usually not home. But I don't know. I think. For some reason. Like. I felt more angrier these past weeks concerning thing, like my parents, you know. yeah cooling, my father. Sorry, give me one moment Okay, but that was. yeah I was realizing like man. I now know by talk if I touched on this before, but it's it's like I have that rage, you know that kind of suppressed rage inside of me. it's been building up more and more throughout the years and, just like I can suppress it, you know I can suppress it most of the time. But sometimes i'm very scared because, if someone says certain things to me like my dad said to me then there's a point where I get triggered about the feelings that happened inside. And then I would just like scream I would just like yell and then afterwards I just remember like I always feel like the sense of shame like who am I Why did I Why did I do that."
383.0,Provider,"mm hmm. Well suppression is not a good thing suppression doesn't mean that everything is resolved it's just gets shoved into. You know, into a cave are some inner cave but it's an energy, you know rage and anger is an energy, so it doesn't stay contained I mean it busts out and it busts out to usually. it's it's not like you said it's out of control. So I think that expression, you know of your of your anger talking about like what are you angry about and what is upsetting to you and how to make sense of those feelings. and also how to calm yourself, you know how to. feel the feelings, but not have them get out of control, you know sort of in a way kind of let the. You know it's like it's if it's in a box is sort of open and let them, let them let some of it out, you know. By expressing and also by doing exercise by moving by. You know, and then alternatively expressing and whether it's in your journal or in therapy or. To make sense of it. Because often anger is about. Some things happening that you don't like or something happened that you didn't wish wouldn't happen that way. And you wish, it would have been different. And you wish you think it was unjust or. You got the short end of the stick or you didn't get paid attention to, or whatever it is, it can be a number of things. But it's essentially a lack of acceptance of the way it is not that it's right but it just is you know certain things just that are they just they are that way. But we don't accept it, we think it's and some things are not acceptable, but they still are like that you know. So it's a process of. cooling your self down and then understanding more about why you're angry and. Sad, and if you want to talk a little bit about what your what your feel outraged about I know you've talked about it before with regards to your parents, but."
6583.0,Patient,"yeah right, I mean when we touched a lot of factors to it that we already kind of discussed know whole like college during you know, in terms of what I want to do you know, looking at my parents and feeling like. You know why what kind of advice would you give me that I follow and i'm looking at us people and, just like. Nothing that's what hurts me it's just like getting to that age where I can say, like I don't look up to you, people. You know I I feel like I believed in you people, but all you did was like I feel angry at myself, because I feel shame like Why am I saying that's my parents, but i'm just like. there's like oh i'm this it's weird being the child numbers like i'm disappointed. You know, like i'm disappointing you guys like and it's so hard. Because i'm disappointed myself as the product. and kind of just. Also. Know lots of rage at the world that's fine you want music is just the rage at the world and then. You know. I think something more specific is like also looking at my sisters, you know. Like. When. When we split ways as a family, you know we kind of went off to like separate parents, but I would compare my life and it's like. I feel YouTube got everything which are different parts of the family, and when you mentioned short end of the stick i'm just like oh my God. i'm stuck with this poor father who like. lazy. lazy father, I can learn nothing come home and do like the basics, you know cook. Do laundry and that's it. I had nothing else is like well dad's like what if I want to learn about certain things like know again. Some, like way past my dad in terms of like intelligence i'm way smarter like I hate saying that too, because i'm just like I, I want to love these people, I want to be understanding, but at the same time it's like. I want to get away. I don't belong with these people, you know, and I believe in these people for like pretty much my entire life and where I am now compared to like the people my peers and my sisters i'm stuck in the same place my dad is so I feel like i've been pulled into the situation. Out of just life circumstances, this is like I was this kid who had the potential to do more things, but what I listened to the wrong people give me the wrong advice thinking telling me like do this do that. And instead I got pulled I feel like i'm. i'm nowhere, I just want to get out. And it makes me feel selfish because i'm just like one. I feel stupid thing, because here I am like complaining and blaming on other people when i'm just like I could take all that in look into the mirror and be like you know what Patrick you're just as much as. In fault. you're just such as for at fault for all this to so it can't get away from the blame the shame anger towards our parents and it reverts back to me. Sorry, that was lot but yeah."
383.0,Provider,"um. Well, I think that. You know just some thoughts that come up. As you share this is that. You know we're intertwined with our parents, but we're all also separate we're also different we're also our own people and we're intertwined with intertwined. And we're also independent so we're really both of these things they make an impression on us. And some things are good and then some things are like yeah like no I don't like I don't want to do that, I want to be different and. Nothing is 100% doesn't have to be 100% like they can make an impression on you. And you can look at. And you you extricate yourself, you. Tell yourself, you know it's like peeling it's like everything like I mean i'm sure there's some things about your pants that you at least have compassion for, if not respect. You know that there's some things it's like the threads of a fabric and you're like i'm pulling out the green I just do not like green and this and you're pulling that out, because that is maybe this. This tendency to be lazy maybe it's. You don't want to emulate those things in your ladder person. When you look at them, but you do see some things that you're like. I. respect some things. And so maybe that's the purple threads and maybe that's a quality that you at least. you're not going to toss it up you're not going to say that sucks and I hate it, you know, and I don't I disagree with it and i'm not want to be a part of it. Because I think we all want to we you know, unless your parent is a total criminal which i've actually worked with people whose parents were criminals and did. perpetrated crimes on them and they still have love for them. So. You can still sort of even if there's nothing left, but you still have love for them as a soul you just don't you just do you can still hold on to that. And then build your own you know what qualities, do you want to emulate like we wouldn't be looked at, you know the values the impact enlist. In group and we reviewed with those values are, I think you're in that group, you know what, what do you want to cultivate maybe you had a parent who is very selfish you want to cultivate selflessness. And you learn from other people about what selflessness is you don't have to learn from your parents anymore about you can learn to look at the other people to learn. So that's just just some thoughts that I don't know how those steps it with you."
6583.0,Patient,"yeah I think what you mentioned about. there's still something that. I do respect I do care about I think that definitely put into words like. Why, no. kids like me, you know we spend is that still kind of like that love for parents like are just they feel like iffy about there's just like yes so true like. There is something and it's like so subtle you know it's not even like said it's just through that feeling, you know we're just like crap. it's like I feel something like I can feel. Something in you know. That i'm still here because I definitely would know like by now there's plenty of people out there to get them out that would definitely do not care and they would be out. By now, you know, without care in the world, just like i'm so glad i'm out of there like, and I would never talk to them again but it's like there's still something for people like me were just like. there's still something that invisible tie. You know where it's just like as much as I say these things, this is like crap right care. And, almost to the point where, just like. I would ask myself why do I care like Why do I care so much you know and it hurts. It hurts to care about these people that are just like tying you down, but you talk like Why do I care. Why do I care and it's not even like a question of like well just stop paying them, you know. From is like an option it's just like. You know, asking like TIM like Why do I care why. right here so much yeah."
383.0,Provider,"I think that you know. we're we're kind of in a world that doesn't really. I mean it's changing but value caring very much you know. And the thing is, is that you care because you're a caring person you care because you have it in you to care about people whether they. merit it today or or not, you know because that's the kind of person that you are, you know so sometimes that's sometimes through remind yourself that you know what the reason I care is because i'm a good person. And I. You know my dad made it might have messed up, but I still care about him and because I have that quality inside of me to care. And that's a good thing in this world so that's where you're forging who you are. You know you're not just like. I could care less about you go to hell kind of guy you know, which is a good thing we need people like that. And you can still move forward to build your independence and. You know, live a life, apart from your dad and. still have a relationship with him, you know it's just going to be what it is, but you're not going to you know kick him and. turn on your heel and disappear, you know because that's that's because that's the kind of person that you are. How does that, how do you feel about that."
6583.0,Patient,"Hope it's I. Hope it's true. that's true. Because. You know, sometimes it feel. selfish yeah. feel like. To be in a place where I just think about me. I can get very lost in that moment. yeah. So I do hope. it's a complicated feeling."
383.0,Provider,"yeah yeah I think you know relationships with because people parents are people and people are imperfect, most people, so you know. He could have shown up and all the ways that he didn't for you, but then not shown up in other ways, that it was still made you mad at him. That would have still made you upset. with him because people are imperfect, and I think that as as we mature we recognize that our parents are just people. There that they're not really doing these things because because they want to hurt you generally. The parents don't that just being their imperfect self and they're imperfect self. has sometimes harmful effects, you know, sometimes it. You know messes with other people people's imperfections. But when you step back enough far enough, and you recognize they're just being. themselves, you know they're imperfect self. kind of totally independent of me, you know. So. yeah I hope that this discussion has helped you to kind of put some of it into perspective and do think that. it's been helpful for for that and kind of. Dealing with your anger."
6583.0,Patient,"yeah, of course, I think, being able to. Just at least talk about it, you know. helps a lot because it's not something I would bring up to really anybody because. it's still sensitive to me, you know it's very sensitive."
383.0,Provider,"mm hmm yeah. yeah because. And i'm sure you know your feelings about your sisters, this also sort of another dimension of this. If you feel that they have received. Somehow something more, better than you."
6583.0,Patient,yeah. You know. it's tough to because I know like. In terms of like you know they're my siblings. So it's kind of hard to for me to divert the anger towards them because i'm just like you know you're just like me who's got put into a circumstances.
383.0,Provider,I know.
6583.0,Patient,"you're the receiver you're just the receiver like i'm the receiver too, so I can relate, you know and i'm not mad at you i'm just kind of. More mad at the givers to say no, or the lack of giving to clarify, you know. yeah."
383.0,Provider,yeah.
6583.0,Patient,"But then again, I think we are touched on it, too, I will recognize that my parents to our the receivers of whatever they went through you know, and I tried to be I need to remind myself or otherwise i'm just going to keep blaming them. right for things and it feels a little undeserving I I recognize that yeah."
383.0,Provider,"Well, the blame is kind of. it's just it's one dimensional or it's it's a dimension and there's other dimensions, you know, to the situation, so your parents were the receivers of certain of life circumstances that may have. made them impotent in some ways. or kind of. Disabled maybe, if you will, you know. So that they didn't have the capacity to give you what it is that you want so it's kind of like. You know, when we blame it's like why didn't you do this well the cut the couldn't they didn't you know they were had some impotence or some. Some disability of some sort that made it so that they couldn't do that. Due to their own traumas. Right yeah yeah The more I learned about my father's traumas The more I. The more understanding I got. about what he was what he was dragging along behind him in terms of those traumas and experiences and. memories, you know that he has you know, in the middle of the night that I don't even know you know I wasn't there you know when he was hit by a car and 11 and then was in a wheelchair for three years and. Had a dad and drank too much and came home, and you know through things around and and so when I just if I think about you know. His That was my own personal you know my personal situation, but the more that I have, the more that I understood what kind of really what kind of mountain he had to climb just to get to the be the guy that he was you know, I was like wow well I you know it was. It it helped to amplify my care and reduce my. Anger right. So maybe you can you know I know you when you said well you didn't you don't know much about your dad. What he's been through."
6583.0,Patient,"Unless the tough part because I also know that he probably won't most likely won't share, you know because I still remember when I asked him about certain things, and these are, I felt like surface thing. This is very general by his life and just wooden. chair, you know which surprised me. And to even happen to like. To go further and ask him about his traumas. that's something. You know this so sensitive. Because I get the history. Of where he came from, and that stuff was. I will never go through that in my lifetime lucky enough to never go through any of that you know I get crazy because, like i've only recently started to kind of typing. Because i'm just like because before I just thought like oh it's just kind of like more like that kind of freaked me out but I didn't really think of it was that at night he would be like yelling. in history. Like as he's dreaming, I can hear him from this room, he should just be like yelling asleep, I was like crap. Before I thought was just more like you know usual nightmares but to happen more on like Oh, I feel like it's happening on a bit happening on the basis. Then I was just like. there's probably something that I wasn't aware of that he's thinking about with his past, you know. Yes, exactly dreamed about you know those things. yeah you know, and the problem is there's just that lack of me, knowing what it is and also respecting that. and trying to understand."
383.0,Provider,Right right.
6583.0,Patient,You know.
383.0,Provider,"You know I mean you might think about finding a special time some kind of time I don't know. Just all you know when you're both in the kitchen or you know, and when you just maybe say one thing like you know i'm your Vietnamese i'm. i'd be enemies to you know. As a result of you and and. I just want to know more about like my background like as if you had a nice person like what. I just want to know you know I mean. We came to America and then. Maybe just let him know you just take it off of him and be more like just want to know about what it is to be who I am. Because of you, and I just if you could just tell me like one thing a week. And just tell you one thing like one thing a week or one thing a month. I just hope and and and let that sort of sit there with him and. Maybe that will work on his conscience like okay my son just wants to know about. You know my hair our heritage and and. So i'm going to try to tell him like one thing a month, you know or one thing weaker. And you can just go, little by little bit by bit. Because you just might be surprised. I had a roommate once, who was Vietnamese I went to India, and she was my roommate. On this trip and we just shared a room together and she told me before you know before we went to sleep she's like. don't be don't be body of don't freak out if I start yelling and my sleep, because I sometimes like have nightmares and I like a yellow and my sleep and. She she was she had actually been you know she had been on a boat, and I mean she has had trauma and she has she has these dreams of like fall and I think she actually did fall into the water and her mother like rescued her something like that and. And she was like in her 40s. And anyway, you know she told me, and I think she did she you know it was just funny because we, we were meditating and we were doing all these like spiritual things and then I do think she. There was a nightmare she wasn't yelling but she did scream I think she screamed out, you know a few times and I was just on this short. trip with her for a few weeks to three weeks, and so I can imagine you know I mean this is like you're saying about your diet like it's could be something ongoing."
6583.0,Patient,"it's it's crazy. I just need better. than but the. try to understand. i'm just fighting between two cultures, you know i'm this kid born in this generation i'm trying to make sense of like. different things you know you're trying to be human at the same time, are you trying to be human. Trying to understand what being human is at the same time it's like it's funny how there's all these different layers to being human. Human in a very general sense, trying to deal with everybody I try not to look at the race I try not to look at the ethnicity that's why don't really cling on to like the culture and tradition, you know, I just want to be open, at the same time it's crazy, how is it's like. it's part of us to as human like the slayer this that makes Patrick and i'm just like. whoa this world is crazy. This game, you know this like. crazy and i'm trying to really navigate and it hurts my head a lot. You know it hurts to have all these. You know i'm just trying to like. damn it's like trying to navigate and try to get to the other side, because I know like I can't hold on to emotions too much and crap like that, but it's it's like and even when you were telling me the story about your friend, you know the two minutes. I want to like cry because every single time I hear those stories, you know. I definitely connected back to my pants i'm just like it's crazy how i'm up there, but like Fuck by I think sorry sorry i'm guessing. But this is. But this is it's crazy how it can be passed on. And somehow like. I feel it strongly that's maybe like us insight to why I do care because it's just maybe in the sense that it's biological."

I think that that's you know that's in you that, like that can't be cut out, you know that's just like inside of you that that relationship that connection with your family and your heritage and and so it's meaningful and. And like you said it's like it's hard to deal with all these feelings so that's why it's really important to have like. A mindfulness or a place where you can just like go ride your bike and just be in the wind and be in the smell the rain and and just be in the present moment because that's where we kind of can get some escape from anywhere all the stories, you know which are me deeply meaningful and. And we have to kind of process our feelings around it and kind of get back to. The present moment and the freshness of the now and your music and you know. kind of thing."
