ID,Role,Message
1974.0,Patient,Good morning.
207.0,Provider,morning I saw that you had an appointment and I thought it was wrong.
1974.0,Patient,"I do, but. I told them that, since I only have to do group or every other week I would just do it today. I would do it i'll do my meeting today and group group next week, but can I do group anyways."
207.0,Provider,You won't be able to the group anyway. For meeting for individual you won't be.
1974.0,Patient,"Okay, well, I told them to make sure that my group does not come up as a no show because i'm only I only supposed to do it every other week anyways."
207.0,Provider,"yeah I don't think you're on the list for for for group now listen, this is my question, so what happened, I thought your to your daughter was pregnant again."
1974.0,Patient,yeah I didn't tell you.
207.0,Provider,The baby.
1974.0,Patient,"Yes, and she got pregnant again just within a couple months and. i've been taking her every appointment, I took her yesterday and they did emergency C section something with their blood pressure. which you might have been what happened last time, so they took the baby through C section actually she finally had it late last night the C section they tried they tried to induce her, but then the baby's heartbeat started. dropping or something so they did the C section I don't know, I was mad as hell, I had to be escorted out because they wouldn't let me stay with her."
207.0,Provider,"Okay, but i'm confused. So that means the baby's premature."
1974.0,Patient,"Well, she was actually she just had her 36 a week so that was considered full term."
207.0,Provider,like this was just the fear that she looked at.
1974.0,Patient,It was in November of last year. October yeah yeah.
207.0,Provider,I might hold up. Maybe like a few months ago.
1974.0,Patient,"No, that was last winter."
207.0,Provider,wow time really.
1974.0,Patient,"wasn't I hadn't called it, in November, I know I should remember the day I think i'm wrong, it was an I had covered in November and I got coven from being in the hospital with her when she had the baby so yeah it was November."
207.0,Provider,"Oh wow. OK, so the baby will turn the horrible."
1974.0,Patient,"really good actually the baby's really good she got she had a different doctor, this time and. You know I found out some stuff because i've been going to all she's been high risks i've been going to all of her appointments with their the last few months and. she's got a really good doctors, on top of it, and I really think it's all last doctor would have been like this doctor that baby may have made it. Because he was just one of them, doctors, like oh you're a first time mom you'll be fine, like everything she was. nervous or had a question about like even two weeks before that happened with the last baby she had an ultrasound scheduled and. The the tech was there, so they just didn't do it and they could have found something, then she had high blood pressure, last time, and he just acted like it was normal and. I just there's so many things I found out that it possibly could have I mean God does everything for a reason, but I think that it could have maybe could have been avoided. button yeah."
207.0,Provider,"The baby, maybe super a major hyper aware."
1974.0,Patient,"Especially her, she was nervous about everything, understandably, but her blood pressure, yesterday, they said they didn't want her lower number over 110 and our upper number over 160. So I actually bought her a blood pressure machine a couple months ago, so she can keep track at home and yesterday when I took her it was like 169. There, because she has to do a stress test three times a week for the last two months that's how good this doctor she's really keeping track of stuff so and she went in yesterday verse just as her blood pressure was up so high, and that's why they ended up. Saying well we're gonna do, Sir, and then, when they went to try to induce her that's when the heartbeat started at they've been I wasn't there aggravated me so i'm just hearing this, but the heartbeat drop so they took around for a C section. So. I was so upset I didn't let her see me upset so upset that they do not let me stay there with her. Because a coven, of course, but I did her stress tests are on the Labor and delivery floor so I was already there with her all day. And I just had a covert test i'm getting clover test every day because she's not letting anybody be around the baby for a couple weeks at least no one's even allowed to see the baby because she doesn't want the baby gets sick, but I gotta call."
207.0,Provider,Every day you can't get tested every day.
1974.0,Patient,"I will they'll let me because i'm going to be around my grandbaby she's gonna need my help, especially with a C section now. But I mean I got one I got one two days ago, so that I was going to get them as often as I could until the baby was born, so when she went in to I would be able to stay, I was hoping they let the dad stay hidden and no call the test how they know you know got it."
207.0,Provider,huh.
1974.0,Patient,"I mean it's called rules, but I think they should make an exception because she's yummy not a real young she's young it was she went through before she wanted me there. But she didn't want me to embarrass her so I couldn't keep arguing in front of her so I had to go out in the hallway and argue and then they they made me leave."
207.0,Provider,"Oh, you mean argue about new thing."
1974.0,Patient,"Yes. But, needless to say. The baby is cute he came in, as early as is he was still six pound 11 ounces."
207.0,Provider,"he's been he he was almost there, maybe another week, he would have been seven pounds."
1974.0,Patient,"Well, she wasn't she was doing October 25 was her due date."
207.0,Provider,She was very sick week.
1974.0,Patient,yeah whatever.
207.0,Provider,yeah so then October 25 that would have been. yeah the been 40 weeks.
1974.0,Patient,yeah if she would have waited another month she might have had a 10 pound baby.
207.0,Provider,um did you. So she how listen you're you're how old is this order because I don't have a teenager right.
1974.0,Patient,"Yes, she's 21."
207.0,Provider,"Okay, open until then your son he's the eldest."
1974.0,Patient,he's 25.
207.0,Provider,So you have a total of what three children. Okay okay.
1974.0,Patient,"I thought I was smart by spreading them out. But then it just prolong this stress of teenagers, then I just had teenage stress for like 15 years."
207.0,Provider,"I I think about that time on. The beauty, I say there's a beauty in having them back the back there's a stress and have them back to back. The stress of having them back the back, is that when you go to the baby stage you're dealing with, not one baby but multiple."
1974.0,Patient,"Thinking was, though, when I was younger is well the first one obviously wasn't planned because I was so young, but I did plan, the next two, but my thinking was. When I have the next one, but this I wanted by the time I have the next one, the old that one will be going into kindergarten so i'll have that one on one time, with the new one for a few years. But I don't think that was a good idea, because now i've been raising three kids and it's 25 years and I still got some time ago and I don't think they bind it as close as they would, if they were closer in age."
207.0,Provider,mm hmm.
1974.0,Patient,Because you know I don't know 16 year old want nothing to do it No nine year old exactly.
207.0,Provider,You know exactly because then the 16 year old thinks that. they're the nine year old parents.
1974.0,Patient,"yeah the kids they're close but they you know when I see my grandkids are close in age and me and my brother I close in age, and we have really good strong bonds and my kids have bonds, but they're not. As as close as they would be maybe if they had been closer in age."
207.0,Provider,mm.
1974.0,Patient,"hmm. would have credit, of whatever it is."
207.0,Provider,"yeah but its overall but. that's good that you're able to like what you know, for you i'm sure it speaks volumes for you to be there for your for your children. And just to the offer that that additional support and encouragement, as they go through."
1974.0,Patient,"Every time I tell you it has been a. Current you know it's been a crazy year to for me, but I came the closest as ever to relapsing yesterday, I even reached out to somebody I was sitting in the parking lot in town where all the drugs are where I used to get my drugs. And I even sent a message and I was in the parking lot at subway and. I know this person doesn't normally have a phone and I have to just go there that's how it used to be anyways and I know like to other people I could just go there, but. I knew I didn't want to so maybe I just kind of did that knowing they weren't going to answer I don't know, but I have not done that this whole time. But i've just been really I don't know I think i've dealt with so much shit in the last couple of years, but I was so upset over and i've been able to stay with my daughter, and then. I mean all my kids are doing pretty well right now, but you know of course my 15 year old stresses me out like crazy cuz she's 15 K rates mean but. Just I mean it's it's hard it's hard to explain I got a lot of physical things I need to be doing, like my house is a mess and i've just I don't know what it is that's the closest I have come and."
207.0,Provider,"What so what Okay, so what what transpired for you to have such an intense moments of like a moment of. I want you to walk me through so what I like to do it's called a sequence of events like what what happened leading up without skipping a detail. That led."
1974.0,Patient,"Up to that mother's. Health it's hard, I mean I think just with all the things that have gone through that I haven't which I was so proud of myself for going through all these things that you already know about. And then you know with my relationship and. I just something really it really triggered me with. You know i'm not married I call my husband whatever but we're not married we've been together 20 years you might as well be married but he's never been an addict he does not understand and he has times, where he's very supportive. And he has times, where he is not and a couple of times this week. Is the last two weeks, especially with my daughter my daughter was needing my help getting our House ready and then. My other daughters homecoming was this weekend and she drove me crazy, because it was like she was getting married and I was dealing with the bride zilla even though it's just homecoming and was homecoming zilla. And him telling me, like all this needs done i've been having family coming down which I enjoy but you know it's a lot to prepare for and you know I try to I can't really talk to him, so I have to text but uh you know I try to tell him oh. Oh, and don't let me forget this too i've been in a lot of pain. I had to have a tooth pulled out a bad infection last week and then. i've i've been in a lot of pain and I don't want pain pills, but nobody seems to be able to help me or or I feel I really feel like I am. In my chart I can read my chart on labeled as an addict, so I think people are just thinking I want pain medicine or something. But I have really bad pain in my arm. My hands in my wrist and and in my feet like and just it's all over my body, but some are the main parts and I don't know what has triggered it in the last few months, but it has triggered and it's been really bad lately. So i've been going to doctors and just nobody just there's just nothing we can do there's nothing we could do. You know I don't want pain pills, I just want you to figure out what's wrong and see if I could take a fix it or something I have fibromyalgia I don't know if that's what it is, or if it's on the right is I don't know. So that's part of it, but with me trying to vent to my husband and telling him I come i'm just overwhelmed i'm stressed. And he made a comment last week about a because I tell them the truth, this i'll say. You know I don't want to get high triggers me to get high, but I don't want to get high, but it triggers it. And he made a comment about me whining about getting high all the time, like he thinks it's been so long, like that it should just be over, you know and it's it's hard, because he won't go to counseling he doesn't understand it. And he likes to throw it in my face here and there, and he has zero trust, even though i'm honest with them about it. But that really triggered me to like telling me i'm whining about getting high i'm not threatening you oh I you're telling me I need to get this this and done so it's making me want to get high and now i'm just i'm just expressing myself that's all. So I don't know that's just all everything just was adding up and then after I got I was so upset I mean, I was in my car crying over not being able to be there with my daughter, and I just want to make sure she was okay like I don't want to be there to say like. Oh, just to be born. know but he's raised her son, she was one he considers her his daughter because her dad's not really in her life. he's not in her life, his family is but he's not mean he's an alcoholic but. I mean, he cares for her he's always taking care of her but it's different you know, but no that's not his father, but he understands he cares for her a lot and. But I was just I had not had an emotional breakdown like that and I don't know how long, I mean I went to my my car did it by myself, because I didn't want her to see me upset. And I think I was more upset because I was mad, and I was worried like that's my daughter, I want to make sure she's Okay, I want to make sure the baby comes out okay. If something happens, I want to be there, you know and it's like they're not hearing me, and it was just all after all of these things that i'm telling you in the last like week or two. I don't know just after all that I just sat there and i'm thinking, a lot of it comes with when I have a lot to do that I don't feel like doing."
207.0,Provider,mm hmm.
1974.0,Patient,"I think that's part of it, and then I think that if I get hi i'm going to get all this energy. But I do have a sister in law, who is as tell you how over the summer, how I had my brother's daughter, because his wife was going through some things she went to treatment. So she came down last weekend and we talked about it, and I was telling her like I hadn't had this conversation because it hadn't happened yet, but she's freshly going through it. But I was telling her like I was even telling her what I know myself like you know we tell ourselves it's going to give us this energy and make us want to get all these things done. But in all reality, you get high and you're full of energy, but you don't accomplish nothing because you're doing 50 things I want and nothing gets finished. So i'm very aware of that and i'm processing everything but uh so I told I talked myself that's kind of how I talked myself out of it when I was having this conversation with my own self my brain and my car. mm hmm um. But uh I don't know I just."
207.0,Provider,"Do you feel like you try to get everything we get this state like because you're trying to keep everything together and just kind of stay on this journey on this road to recovery and just kind of to be that example and show everyone, do you think that. you're in the process of doing that you're taking on when moving to."
1974.0,Patient,"Yes, I do I enjoy helping i've been doing a lot for my kids my son has been doing so great, I mean. he's got a great job he's he's got his driving privileges which he hasn't driven since he hasn't been licensed probably since he was seven in Google awesome. But i've been driving him not even just him but going back and forth like an hour and a half away to help him get his paperwork to get his license back because. You know, we don't have any other family down here to help him and he has a job now and and i've been driving my daughter to zanesville, which is an hour away three days a week. I have not been working because of my daughter's work schedule and then me taking care of all of them and their stuff which I like when my kids need me and makes me feel good because they're older and they don't always need me anymore. But it makes me feel good to help them, but I think, with the added pressure of my husband who's constantly reminding me of these things that I need to get done which I do need to get done I don't know i'm not I can't blame him, but I tell him all the time he's one of my biggest triggers. And I don't know if that's."
207.0,Provider,"The end maybe this is something that we can talk about another time because i'm. saying it sounds to me, yes, you have over you overextend yourself, I know you're trying to you're helping your children but, honestly, you overextend yourself. To fill areas in their life that needs to be filled right because you went through this whole process with your son and everything. for everything that they've been through both he and his wife and in your grandkids and then you had your grandkids for a little bit. And even though we had talked about many who kind of somewhat prepared yourself at in being equitable, that you will be there to take on your grandkids. Then prior to your son, there was your teenage daughter, and that went on for a while and that and and so each thing that you've gone through it, that is just great just talking about it that's just like. Okay, well, what did you bring like at what point did you hit reset so you went through this whole thing with your daughter, then they went through this whole thing with your son. And then you went through this whole thing with your daughter now. Because the reality is it's, not even a year that whole first pregnancy her losing the baby you trying to be there for her, and now this pregnancy and now that she has the baby and the sense of being shut out. Of wrinkles so that all within itself it's like you overextend yourself, for your children you do all of that, and then to turn around. and have this sense or this feeling that you're going to shut me out or you're even thinking or you even utter a word of not allowing me to continue to being a part of that that is an emotional. trauma by itself, and now with your husband because, like you said, even though I can't blame him the truth of the matter is is stopping and saying to yourself. The things that he's saying from. That I need to do is it really truly something that I do need to do, and have I been putting it off because i've been so distracted with trying to be there for my children. And so, if if that question or that statement is true. Is it really. A matter because oftentimes when we're overwhelmed when we're stressed. We don't keep things in perspective we kind of convoluted is it that. He really is wholeheartedly nitpicking at the history that you have, or is it that. Because you're getting overwhelmed and you guys have been together for over 20 some odd years because you're going you're getting overwhelmed he sees the signs and knows the sign off."
1974.0,Patient,"I don't agree with that, because. He encourages me to do these things for my children. And he'll even a compliment me on. You know, oh you're you're doing so good at this and you're doing good he encourages that."
207.0,Provider,mm hmm.
1974.0,Patient,"These physical things of you know, things that need done around the House or whatever it may be. We haven't even been staying home we've been at the cabinets are home that we haven't been standing out we've just been like going in and out getting things grabbing things that really could wait, but there are. he's he's nitpicking I know he is, and I mean he'll even tell me like Oh, you need to take a day to rest but and then that they'd arrest he's telling me what all I need to get done and. I truly I don't know it's it's weird and I told him like I feel like sometimes he almost push he tries to push me there. Because it makes maybe when i'm getting high and makes him feel more superior I don't know what is. mine. For me to tell you what you're doing is making me feel this way, why would you continue to do that unless you wanted me to that's how I feel because i'm very."
207.0,Provider,"busy, but then being but then being so again going back to what I just said it's keeping everything in perspective to understand okay. Because when I said go through a sequence of events and you said it's so much. So that it's like everything about overextending yourself, whether it be for your children, whether it be for your partner, whether it's whoever it may be, for in overextending yourself, is for you to evaluate and say. Is it starting to me, is it burning out and do I recognize it's burning me out, but I still push myself to do it because I see it, because it brings me some joy in doing it, and if that is it but it's still reevaluating insane I have to have my cutoff point or I have to learn I."
1974.0,Patient,"don't think that I think that. I know it's temporary. That they're needing my help right now I know it's temporary he finally just got his privileges, so he does my son doesn't need me to do all this stuff to help him get his privileges now. my daughter just had her baby now she had a C section so she's gonna need some help I love to be there, helping with the baby but it's stupid little stuff like. I made my husband sandwich the other day, because I didn't have time to make him his chicken salad or whatever it was he got so mad at me for making him because I get up at 430 every morning with him and make his lunch and get him off to work. I mean, he woke my daughter up bitching because I made him a lunch meat sandwich he's been eating lightweight sandwiches for years, not every single day but. it's sad that triggers me like everything I do for you and you're gonna you're gonna yell at me over a lunch meat sandwich."
207.0,Provider,"yeah that's also sounds like you're spoiling when it sounds it also sounds like you do, but but it sounds to me Jamie. That or have you ever really just taking that time just you and him alone kind of like cutting off everybody or block out everybody for a moment. And just having a you and him day and really have a heart to heart conversation about all the work you have done and how far you have come, but how. The things that he doesn't says how that is triggering because I remember, there was a point where. I think it was thanksgiving it was some major holiday that was coming about and his family was coming over. And you talked about how that was just anxiety provoking for you, because I don't know if it was his sister or his mom or somebody that was overwhelming. And I remember, we, and I think it was in group, where you talk about it a lot and I think it was something that you needed to get off your chest, and you talked about how that is triggering for you like you had. You had the. You did not succumb. To the to the trigger. But how overwhelming and felt like you just needed to just do something to just relax yourself, because of the fact that you're in law that came on so have you ever really like taking that time to have a heart to heart with him for him to understand."
1974.0,Patient,"How much yes, I have, and I actually just today, I just like I said I text him a lot of things, because things set him off. And then, this he needs counseling he's had a lot of trauma in his life, he was raised by only his dad his mom left him at a at a very young age, and never came back into his life until he got older she's been on drugs her whole life she still is and she's in her 60s. So. he's got a lot of trauma and them and, like, I was messaging him and telling him that you know I know i'm not perfect. i'm not saying i'm perfect but i'm trying to do i'm doing this and doing that i'm trying my best. But there's things that you can work on to, but the minute I mentioned something to him that he's doing he makes it he takes it as an insult and it just the conversation goes out the window and he gets angry and I don't appreciate him i've tried a million times."
207.0,Provider,"It sounds. It sounds like to now that you said that his mom is like that, and she still is, it sounds like there's a lot of displaced. anger and frustration, because of your own history with it the fact that maybe you're still on suboxone and how he feels that it sounds to that. Even though you are in a better place and different from his mom but because his mom is going at it and he so long thing you're in for that kind of bond and what have you it sounds like some of that is displayed on you put that sounds like."
1974.0,Patient,"And same with his sister, I mean that's really all and his dad was his best friend that who raised him and his dad just died, you know not too long ago. and his sister as an addict who's lost her kids and she's still a full blown addict and you know he he doesn't mind the suboxone so much because he sees how much it's changed my life, but I also think, because he has smoked weed since he was. That is, if he didn't smoke weed he might throw that up in my face, but he has said something to it to me before along the effects like. You know why can't you just not be in anything and to him smoking marijuana is. is literally what calm, it says medicine he's got his medical cart and everything but it calms him down but he's never quit unless he was in jail or in the hospital, so the minute he said to me, before I can't wait to the day you're on nothing well. when's the day going to come you're going to be on nothing that's your medicine it's helping you, you know he shuts up so either he feels that way, and he doesn't say it because of his own."
207.0,Provider,"cognition and belief for that. i'm gonna have to cut you because my other patient jump in let's meet on the 14 because you come to group next Thursday. Or you know why, because I know you like coming to the group so let's meet on the."
1974.0,Patient,The.
207.0,Provider,me on the wall. let's do. This.
1974.0,Patient,"Okay, this fault at two o'clock. So I did call. A day late."
207.0,Provider,about me now I did it. I didn't see that about.
1974.0,Patient,"You can market as cancelled, instead of a no show."
207.0,Provider,"Yes, yeah yeah I have to I did answer, but I also have, I think I have to go in there and do it."
1974.0,Patient,"Okay, I just want to make sure that i'm in full compliance I did my surveys, before I jumped on with you, so they should all be done."
207.0,Provider,"Okay, no problem I gotcha."
1974.0,Patient,"No, I don't I try to stay on."
207.0,Provider,This yeah no I didn't I didn't get that message about your daughter so.
1974.0,Patient,"I know where I jump off to, but I wonder if. If this pain i'm having is also triggering things I."
207.0,Provider,Have you been to the doctor.
1974.0,Patient,"I have, I, for the first time in 20 years i've been going a lot in the last couple of weeks, but like I said I almost want to switch because I can see my chart online and they have me labeled as an addict. So I think that they think i'm coming in and first thing I tell them is I don't want pain medicine, I just want you to fix it find out. So that could also be something, but I really scared myself yesterday. But I talked myself out of it so. that's all that matters."
207.0,Provider,"And if you feel like you know, even when you're there and you're you feel like you know I know that you know my history, but this legitimately is something that's going on and we need to figure it out and i'm not seeking pain, I really need this is a new. thing is a sudden onset I didn't do anything, and if you did anything extraneous or you think you did something or what have you."
1974.0,Patient,"know I just have fibromyalgia and i've dealt with it. Years ago, it just hasn't bothered me for a long time, I think that's what it is, I don't know but i'll let you so there there's no way I can get in group today they'll kick me out."
207.0,Provider,yeah because you because you because we met today that's why.
1974.0,Patient,"I know, but I didn't know if they would know."
207.0,Provider,I would know. All right.
1974.0,Patient,"All right, we'll see you next Thursday then."
207.0,Provider,No problem.
1974.0,Patient,Thanks bye.
