ID,Role,Message
10125.0,Patient,"Hello. sorry about that. sorry about all the other time well. i'm the one time my zoom zoom zoom and or my Internet I think it was my Internet because i've had several problems with that, but. The Internet people said that day when I call, they said it was fine, so I called zoom because it just when I would get on it would act like it's gonna let me add, and then it would just go to like where it says error send feedback."
706.0,Provider,mm hmm.
10125.0,Patient,"So they had me like doing all this stuff and it wasn't working so I had to uninstall and reinstall it. But I don't understand that because I tried it on my computer to, and it was doing the same. So would be my advice. I don't know, I think it was just. I don't know what it was, but. So, then they. scheduled me for the next day to see you right."
706.0,Provider,uh huh.
10125.0,Patient,"So I get on i'm ready to go and they're like Oh, we rescheduled that basically do that and i'm like okay that's fine, but I didn't get an email or anything."
706.0,Provider,"They didn't like. that's for now lately, as far as the. The the timing, as far as like people when we reschedule things are not getting rescheduled so. I don't I don't know."
10125.0,Patient,"You don't have to worry about me it really was it, you know but i'm sure that's aggravating for you, but."
706.0,Provider,I thought. That was what day was that.
10125.0,Patient,"That was Friday when they had me scheduled to see you, you know because I was supposed to see you Thursday and then Friday. They scheduled me at 330. I think, and then. When I checked it and they said."
706.0,Provider,"yeah because I had a. See Okay, so I had a training with another person that brain heart on the system like they were there's some new stuff that they were going to go over. And so I didn't have that them know I had sent a message like when I set that up, which is like two weeks before and said hey during this time to this time black I can't have any appointments and so, then they they made that appointment and then I was like. it's black like did you guys see that it was black so, then they had to reschedule yeah so I apologize for that and then."
10125.0,Patient,"Again, that was fine too, I felt so bad, though I just felt like so I wasn't upset because I was like no I yesterday was a fluke and then. I had another meeting scheduled Monday and they scheduled me Monday."
706.0,Provider,yeah Monday yep you were scheduled at 330.
10125.0,Patient,yeah well they told me five.
706.0,Provider,"Who told you, I don't do."
10125.0,Patient,"I think they said five, and I think they were saying their time with they told me my time."
706.0,Provider,"Okay. So yeah five o'clock. Their time would be well they're Pacific time, so if they said five o'clock their time it would have been eight o'clock your time here's there's a three hour difference."
10125.0,Patient,"yeah I don't know what I checked in there, like was at 330 i'm like wait that was Fridays appointment, you said five today so, then I look like i'm like Well now, I. Know showing for three appointments when really literally like two of them are their fault, one of them was mine. But I like it when Stacy to get like. annoyed you know, and I."
706.0,Provider,Know don't worry about that i'm just trying to figure out the five of the five o'clock thanks so much. Times four o'clock my time which is two o'clock their time so five o'clock their time is seven o'clock my time eight o'clock your time.
10125.0,Patient,That makes no sense.
706.0,Provider,Because you're three hours ahead of the Pacific so everything goes on Pacific time if they're saying our tent like our time zone barnhart that's Pacific time zone so that's. Three hours earlier than you and two hour.
10125.0,Patient,earlier than you. I lost Jeff. Hello. there.
706.0,Provider,"Maybe they thought, maybe five o'clock my time zone, but that would that would be so that'd be six o'clock your time zone."
10125.0,Patient,yeah I have no idea.
706.0,Provider,Either like.
10125.0,Patient,"It didn't say the word my time they said, is to like my time. That you know they didn't say hey it's my time they said, your time meeting me, you know. I ever got on there and."
706.0,Provider,Time would be. Four o'clock my time and I only work until 345 my time so that wouldn't even make. Any sense so anyway it doesn't matter i'm glad to see you today.
10125.0,Patient,"yeah me too. i'm gonna be the date because I when I checked in just before I was like what is it going to be today like. Wrong time or I don't i'm not a patient there anymore, what is it."
706.0,Provider,"No, no, no, no, no, no, no, all right so tell me about all the exciting things you've been doing with all your extra time because that's what we talked about last time was the gift of time."
10125.0,Patient,"We did, and I actually took my husband to top off he has been wanting to do that. too because. She works like four hours, and so, if we went out there and it took a while you know what you know what this is top off."
706.0,Provider,No i'm assuming it's like a golfing place.
10125.0,Patient,"yeah you like eat eat food there you can it's kind of like outdoor Z kind of like you're on like a deck and it's open and you hit balls out into this. Like a driving range type thing, but they have games, you can play like they have different targets different colors and and its computerized and you do games on there. He has been wanting to do that for so long and we never have been able to because. of her scheduling picking her up from work and."
706.0,Provider,By the time you get out there you'd have to turn around and come back you know it's just a big fancy out.
10125.0,Patient,"And it's not close to us it's like in westchester area, so I took that opportunity the day that we talked I actually when he got him I said it's the shower and everything we're going to my and he's like where i'm surprised. When he was literally so excited."
706.0,Provider,awesome.
10125.0,Patient,"yeah and his birthday was that next week, so. um. That was really a nice little treat and. You know. He just really loves golf and has gotten away from it. and responsibilities with all my screw ups and everything he really had to get away from it, so it was kind of like a reward for him to slash reward for me. It was really nice I couldn't believe I found myself like feeling like we had to rush but reminding myself that we didn't have to."
706.0,Provider,"have no place to go, you have all the time you mean."
10125.0,Patient,"Yes, and then there's been a couple times we've just gone to dinner or to a friends of ours house and just you know, on that because last time so go to his friends and their wives are like where's Kurt you know he's like oh she's gotta get mason and. You know, he had to stay with her. And so, now I can go and like."
706.0,Provider,No.
10125.0,Patient,"They did and stuff so that was good so yeah and my daughter my relationships and really good, I guess, because she's gone away from me more and. We can see."
706.0,Provider,absence makes the heart grow fonder.
10125.0,Patient,"It does, and I feel like we've been getting along and she just seems appreciative of the car and all that we've done and I don't know things are just going really good."
706.0,Provider,"And she's growing up she's just becoming her own woman, and you know."
10125.0,Patient,"God, I was so proud of her the other day she was out and about and she had called me and I missed the call I guess that she called my husband and asked. jeannie anything from the store i'm at the grocery and he was like no I can't think of anything well she came home and she has like. burn shaving cream and things that she needed toiletries and that's what I usually buy but I guess I haven't had them and she just took it upon herself to do that and then went to the Deli and got cheese, in order to correctly. because she noticed, we were out of it, and she wanted to eat that at the school like cheese and crackers to she ordered ordered it just like I order it, you know, like the papers in between and stuff and I was. Like did you order that it's in the Deli or did you. grab it at the grabbing gosh you know I ordered it I said tell me what you said and she told me, and I was like i'm in. You know. All this time you think they can't do this they can't do that we really were forced to they're able to you know yeah. yeah it was it was kind of an awakening like hey she's. Really growing up on me."
706.0,Provider,"yeah well and that gives you that self assurance like we talked about that you know you know you have to let them go out into the big world and you just hope that everything that you've taught them along the way sticks with them, and obviously. there's some things that are sticking so that's."
10125.0,Patient,"yeah obviously and you don't get to see it like you say, because you just kind of as a mom I noticed myself, even just like we take over a little bit just because. Sometimes it's just easier, frankly, is easier. on it."
706.0,Provider,"And to control everything, because then you. know we go. yeah oh i'm there with you 100% i'm very much a planner I like to be in control, I like to know how things are going to go it's very hard for me to to release that control to somebody else, including my husband i'm like to release it to him."
10125.0,Patient,"yeah I don't either in that funny story when she was small and she was sick ones, and I had to work and I couldn't be there to the doctor, so I had made a list and wrote everything down and like put her insurance card on the counter and an envelope, and all this stuff and. And then the doctor that we saw at the time was a patient of mine, I was an optician for living for 1520 years and I did her glasses, for her so she. Was patient, so I just called her personally like hey heads up my husband's bringing my daughter and she's sick and. You know if you could because he's not going to ask any questions, and when I asked him what's going on he's not gonna know he'll give me like the whole like I don't know she went to the doctor she's got medicine it's fine i'm like you know guys, are they have no like. ya know orientations like this don't say stuff so I called and said just give me a buzz afterwards and give me the dates and. So she said when they're in there. He said something I asked a question and she goes Oh, and he goes to my wife call you already. Did, how do you know that he goes I just know my wife and I figured she probably called you first I got here is not that I don't trust it it's just that I need to have that control and it."
706.0,Provider,"yeah yeah absolutely I definitely understand. yep hi and I would do too, so you know it's and it's just that type of personality that you have and. find somebody that's compatible with that, because if you've got somebody that also needs to be in control all the time that's not gonna work."
10125.0,Patient,"out and he doesn't he's fine with letting me take control. And I make sure people know like he's a really good helpful dad because it can look like i'm doing it all. mm hmm from a distance, because when really he just allows me to do that because he would surely do whatever I asked."
706.0,Provider,You know yeah mm hmm.
10125.0,Patient,"Well, I have."
706.0,Provider,"talked about to you know that that healthy balance of. yeah what you need to control and what you can let some of that goes to leave more time for you, so you know and and you got some of that gift of time back when your daughter, you know, was able to drive after has our car. You can do that now. In the past, potentially letting some of the other control factors go that you had to control what i'm still giving you a little bit more time, even when you did have that responsibility with her. it's just hard for you to ask for help, or but somebody else help, and I understand that it's an it takes practice and it's hard to do, and sometimes you know i've got two kids so. I used to do it all, on my own, and now that I have my husband, because my my oldest son has a different other than my youngest which is my current husband and it's very. challenging for me to not do it all, because I did it all for so long."
10125.0,Patient,"Yet, because."
706.0,Provider,"I was a single mom single moms they do it all, you know, and so, then when you have somebody there that steps in and take that role. it's hard for you to relinquish any of those responsibilities, because you've always been doing them, but once you actually do what some of them come off your shoulders, it is such a relaxing feeling, to know that you're not in it alone but there's somebody that's helping you. So I mean I get it, though I get it, why you, you know didn't really put much on him but. Just know that relationships are partnerships and he sees that so if he could help you to be more relaxed then that's going to be better. For him just mentally and on his side of things, you know he might feel that. Because he didn't do a napper because you had to carry so much love, because you had to do everything you thought, maybe that's what kind of drove down the path that you went on, and he might feel some guilt from that."
10125.0,Patient,"He has expressed that to me before for like. i'm. Here, like he's even pointed out like you know I would I would do anything you needed me to do I I just realized that you're the kind of person that likes to do that and be real hands on mom. You know because I did work full time at one time, I mean I did have a job and I did actually have two jobs at one time, and I still insisted on doing the bath in the cooking and I just like. I don't know I really enjoyed being that busy mom I just I think it just really gave me less time to get inside my own head, I guess, and I contend to do that, I think anybody can, but I really can so. I feel like a little bit like I don't know, but then, at the same time that's not clear, because now even I feel like I don't really even know why i'm yet again if i'm not a mom if i'm not a wife if i'm not running around like a chicken with my head cut off. Like what who am I I don't even know like what I stand for like what I even like."
706.0,Provider,yeah because.
10125.0,Patient,"i'm so you can you like. You can get to them like. what's for dinner oh what everybody else likes i'll have that. For once we get to drive there who wants this Oh, whatever everybody else wants i'll just have that because it's easier and i'm just mom and I don't care really you know and now i'm like no i'm going to decide what I like and. Things like that, but I don't even know if I really care I don't know it's just is that good or."
706.0,Provider,"Well, I mean it's just you just have to figure out what it is that you that what you want, so if there's just try things like you know, like ego. For instance, people go and try sushi some people love it some people hate that you know typically you either really like it or you really dislike you don't find like an in between like it cities okay."
10125.0,Patient,"You know, as."
706.0,Provider,"A very specific thing you know and it's just like. You know, like musicals and operas and stuff like that either you really like it or you really just dislike it you don't find that in between like, and I can go sit through one. You know it's you know you have to have that love for it, so you should figure out what it is that you love you know what did you."
10125.0,Patient,"know just don't care like I don't even care, but I think it's because I probably really do the kind of type i'm just so used to giving up whatever but. I don't know it's good to be easy going, but I know it's that good to be like. Now you hear about that worries me a little bit like."
706.0,Provider,"The things that you use to enjoy think back before you were a mom. Think back before you know you were a mom before you were wife, what kind of person, where you."
10125.0,Patient,Is he.
706.0,Provider,busy yeah you'd like to stay busy I mean that's that's obvious and and I completely get that but you what did you enjoy doing.
10125.0,Patient,"um I love to dance, so I I really like you're a couple years ago I got into like Simba. Then thing i've been thinking about doing that again because I love to dance and."
706.0,Provider,I think it'd be cool if you and your husband like we had talked about to like a ballroom dancing class.
10125.0,Patient,And then I brought that up to him know.
706.0,Provider,What did he say he.
10125.0,Patient,"Totally down he's not. he's not like a big dancer or anything but he definitely can, if he. You know. wants to and. Just like I don't know you would love him he's just very. He didn't have such a great upbringing."
706.0,Provider,Think he's.
10125.0,Patient,"leaning in and just more like what a flexible and just. You know he's open to anything he's very i'm equipped, I feel like I want to be more like him the way. he's very deep like he wants to Oh, how does this work, I want to read on that or a show on you know, the United States Government he'll watch that just because and i'm like Why do I want to watch that i'm out of school I don't care about that. But he does it's not that even cares he just is interested in everything. I know and."
706.0,Provider,"understand he he likes down and watch jeopardy, and like knows all the answers."
10125.0,Patient,"yeah. it's tough. or like how how to those how to do things where you go to that they show you like the factory and how they make all this stuff or whatever like how to make macaroni and cheese, the factory like down to the."
706.0,Provider,yeah the.
10125.0,Patient,conveyor belts and stuff and i'm like.
706.0,Provider,yeah.
10125.0,Patient,Whatever though he knows a lot.
706.0,Provider,"yeah so that's just a difference of the different the different way, the brain works, and then you know people have different love languages, too, so your love language is, you are a person that likes to. Provide service your service provider. So if. I have to cook and I have to clean and I have to keep a nice house and that's how you know I love you because i'm doing all these things for you, this is my love language. and your husband's love language is more of i'm a provider I you know I go to work, I make sure that both you know get paid I take care of the family. And I think the PC we're missing that you know, he was wanting was he lost part of his love language, which is that, like. Physical affection, because you weren't available for it, so he you know that piece of your love language that physical affection that time spent together all those two pieces of your love language you lost because you last time, when I get to find them again. And then, all your pieces will. fit together. yeah holy God because right before there was like gaps, you know, like you had your love language he had his and there's nothing connecting you in the middle, because those two were missing Now you can put them back together and reconnect."
10125.0,Patient,"Can I just say thank you there, because just what you just said, I can really tell you listen because, like we didn't even talk about. That this week and you remember, like that i'm like a service person and I don't even know if we talked about love language, I know I read the thing and did the quiz and my husband's is like being the provider, and I can really tell you listen to me and Karen that just means a lot. To me, I love that. My my son was asked, once in school to compare his family to a car."
706.0,Provider,mm hmm.
10125.0,Patient,"And he wrote that. My husband was the frame of the car holding this all together mm hmm I was the motor that kept everybody moving. And my daughter was the radio, the noise, because she was done, you know. mm hmm young young man like maybe in the first or second grade at the. Time and he said he was the tires you know just rolling along with his dad trying to help support his dad or whatever, I thought that was really. I said i'm the motor he's like yeah you keep everybody in the House going and my husband is the you know body of the car and I. I love that you know that was really cool idea for the teacher to do because it lets your kids though where what everybody does in the family and what their role is. And then, it takes. It takes everybody to work together. yeah get. Things accomplished and. I tell my daughter, that all the time we're a family. And we do things for each other, whatever it may be, and you know, I think that, of all things i've given her is a good. Family life that she really loves family and like we're not near our family for a while she gets. where she just wants to go and hang out with my mom or you know somebody in our family because we've always been close to our family, and so I just think Maybe I should get back to that a little bit like being with my sister like I talked I think I said that last time. I would like to vote on my relationship with my sister my brother because we've always been really close. And i've kind of i've kind of alienated myself, because my sister's a nurse and I don't want I know she would see right through me sometimes you know. and"
706.0,Provider,"my brother has don't know. The nurse like we talked about knowing that she's a nurse she is she is that person nurses, are those people that tend to be non judgmental helping loving. Like it's in their nature to be a nurse is very challenging my mom's a nurse, and I will tell you, she is the most loving non judgmental person to ever come across i'm. sure your sister might be the person that you can finally because you already opened up your husband, but your sister might be, once you guys kind of reconnect. That person that you can open up to and release some of that weight, because you because you weren't hiding anymore you're not living a double life. yeah she."
10125.0,Patient,And I got about that.
706.0,Provider,"yeah she might be, you know you always imagine the worst but really she's she's a nurse she's seen it all."
10125.0,Patient,she's not yeah.
706.0,Provider,"You know she's not going to judge you were hurt her job is to do no harm and to help people she's not going to judge you because you had a problem, and you got how."
10125.0,Patient,"My husband that she probably already knows. She probably got like. Keep it Nice. And I like. I I don't i'd like to i'd like to think I kept it pretty good I mean. it's I think she'd be shocked, but he's he's like i'm sure she knows, or has an inkling of a."
706.0,Provider,field yeah I mean.
10125.0,Patient,i'm out yeah.
706.0,Provider,"You know I go through the drive through and i'm like and that can tie, you know that. comes under the influence like I can just tell, by the way that they present themselves the way that they talk. about their eyes look, because those are things you can't control so. If you're taking something to alter your state of mind and it changes the way that your eyes look."
10125.0,Patient,at changing me.
706.0,Provider,"That you're. Right oh apparent yeah but, but you think nobody knows, because you're in your own little world but, in reality, you change and so she. Probably you know and. And I mean there's nothing wrong with that she just hasn't confronted you sometimes confrontation is not somebody is way of. You know, dealing with things a lot of people don't like confrontation so we're waiting for you to come to her so she can say you know what I already knew that but you know, thank you for you know being open, thank you for trusting me to tell me that."
10125.0,Patient,"yeah I mean it trust is not the issue at all, I know I can trust that she won't tell anyone if I don't want her to or that she will I more afraid of. I guess you call it such we would call a judgment, but I don't think she's really gonna like judge me, but I think she'll never again. Look at you the same breath me, yes, and she will never again think of me the way she does like she's never gonna ask me to come over feeder cattle she's on vacation that's for sure you know."
706.0,Provider,"I know I don't I don't think that because you're you know you you automatically go to that negative place in your brain because that's how you view yourself so. That you know, like because you feel that way about yourself, you know when you were in in that active. Using stage when you were you know, taking the opiates when before you got on medication all of that that's how you view yourself, as you know, a non trustworthy not you know didn't deserve to have the things that you have. And so now that's just kind of imprinted in your brain so you're thinking okay well if somebody else knows that I did that they're not going to trust me they're not going to want me at their house they're not going to believe that i'm a good person anymore, because look what I did. You know and that's just because that's how you thought about yourself."
10125.0,Patient,yeah I didn't still do like in a way.
706.0,Provider,"Well, you know that guilt and shame, it takes a long time to process and let it go. Because during the time that you were using there's a lot of damage that's done."
10125.0,Patient,To relate it.
706.0,Provider,To yourself to your self esteem.
10125.0,Patient,"it's probably because I just knew. When you're doing something you know is wrong and you continue to do it it's like what kind of person does that in now, or that could potentially damage everything I have like. You know me. or get my kid taken away or even though I really did take super. take measures to make sure that it. was never around her or in the House, or you know, whatever."
706.0,Provider,I have different lives.
10125.0,Patient,Totally totally but potentially I could have went to jail you never know.
706.0,Provider,I mean anything.
10125.0,Patient,"That would really torn my little family apart and to keep doing that, knowing that is like what kind of mom does that you know, so I just really. Judged myself for that it's weird because when other people talk about judging yourself on groups and stuff I can totally see and be empathetic and be like don't judge yourself, you were. You weren't yourself, you were but I can't do that for myself it's just like I won't make up to a higher standard I."
706.0,Provider,"don't know be your worst critic nobody is going to come down harder on you than you. So. The, the fact is that opioid use disorder is a disease and follows the disease model, so I when you made the decision to start that that piece of it that was something that could be controlled, you know you controlled, am I going to use this for the first time, however. You know, am I going to you know I take this medication for a B and C, am I going to take it appropriately or am I going to start taking more because it feels good that's the thing you can control. Once your body, you know once your body takes hold once those pathways of your brain change once you have changed that circuitry of your brain. it's no longer a choice it's that your body needs it to survive you feel sick you feel like death you don't want to do anything it changes your whole life. And so you so, then you like, whether you want to do it or not, whether you want that euphoric feeling whether whatever it was that drove you to it in the first place, even when you want to stop. You can't because your body says no. So, then you have to find something to plug those receptors. so that he can feel normal again and that's what the suboxone does it plugs those receptors so that you don't need to have the opiate the opioids to function on a daily basis, so you can live the quality of life that you deserve and want to live. So don't come down on yourself, because it just took you. You got where you needed to go so with anything, be be proud and grateful that you've found your way you found your way to something that helped you some people don't and they end up veteran."
10125.0,Patient,and
706.0,Provider,that's that though that's the end of for somebody that is out on that is actively using that has a substance use disorder. Those are the ends for them if they don't find recovery they find that's a prison there's really not a whole lot in between eventually they're going to find out their prison.
10125.0,Patient,yeah. And I knew I was headed that way so yeah. I I knew it.
706.0,Provider,"yep so you, you took a different path and you took the path to recovery you found something that allowed you to let go of the drugs, because you didn't want them anymore your body wanted them, but you didn't. Like you're like I don't want this, but I don't I feel horrible like hi, how do you how do I do this."
10125.0,Patient,mm hmm.
706.0,Provider,"So you found something to help you it's a medication it's just like somebody who's diabetic who needs to take their insulin every day if they don't take their insulin their quality of life is poor and eventually they'll die. And you know. again. it's right anything a medication that you take for a disease. yeah you know don't be proud of yourself that you found that instead of looking at when I was actively using who you know what kind of a mom continues to use and continues to do this, and continues to do that. Whatever mom that is that's not you because you stopped you found help you you got out. So that doesn't apply to you anymore."
10125.0,Patient,yeah.
706.0,Provider,"What applies to you is I love my family I love my husband I love my life and I wasn't ready to let that go, so I found something that could help me and I took my life back."
10125.0,Patient,that's you yeah you.
706.0,Provider,took your life back. And you were a great mom and you know you did everything that you could to make sure that your daughter had. An amazing childhood and now she's a young woman now you're reconnecting with your husband look at all the things that you have now that you wouldn't have had had you not gone down that path of recovery.
10125.0,Patient,"yeah I mean i'm lucky to still have a husband, you know Hello. yeah I mean I just feel so grateful for him and that you know and because it's such it was such a secret. i've you know he's my confidant he's he's it Oh, I mean he's the person I turn to to talk to you because I can't really. Talk to anyone else and he's okay with that sometimes I feel like a narcissist like i'm just talking about myself and over but he's like no really like I think I feel so much better, knowing that you're telling me. Rather than just. Being everything like a secret I feel like we weren't connecting."
706.0,Provider,mm hmm.
10125.0,Patient,"So uh huh but you know what I mean like. you're talking about yourself, sometimes even on group or here i'm. Just like, can I say one more thing just talking about myself."
706.0,Provider,Like.
10125.0,Patient,"I don't want to hear one more thing about myself, you know."
706.0,Provider,"yeah but sometimes it's okay to focus on you. you're so used to giving to others and doing for others that it's hard for you to turn the attention on to you for too long, because you're like. Oh i'm being selfish I need to do something for somebody else. yeah but what you need to do is make sure that you're okay and be you being okay means that you go to group and you go to therapy and you can confide in your husband. And that makes you okay with yourself then that's what you need to do because that's part of self care, besides all of those extra things you do on the side to make yourself feel good and kind of rediscover who you are. mentally you need to make sure you're Okay, and that piece of it is processing through all that guilt all that shame all of that Oh, I should have done this, if I would have done this, all of those the feelings you can't carry those with you and be healthy mentally."
10125.0,Patient,You have to.
706.0,Provider,process through them and let them go and forgive yourself.
10125.0,Patient,Just yeah.
706.0,Provider,"Get you made, you made a mistake it took hold of you, and you, and you know you're you're always going to be that everybody's always that person like it's not going to happen to me."
10125.0,Patient,i'm stronger than.
706.0,Provider,I can get.
10125.0,Patient,That you're overthinking handle that.
706.0,Provider,"No, no, but that's always where people are going to go oh it won't happen to me, I can do it just once, or you know I can just use this you know moderately and i'll have control it's not going to take hold of me. i'm different than everybody else you know what I mean but that's what people. Tell themselves. And before you know it, you are in those grasp of that drug and you can't break free."
10125.0,Patient,And then you. have to get arrow.
706.0,Provider,"yep but then you have to get help and that's what you did you know and we even talked about you know, because you know when I started with you. You were using like your methamphetamines and you were using it far more than then, then you know we talk every week and we just kind of do a check in so two weeks ago, I saw you and you are used once how many times have you since then. nine nine look at now you're down to zero."
10125.0,Patient,"I know we did talk about that, but I didn't I just just kind of trying to like not even think about it really like i'm a proud of myself, yes, but i'm just trying to like."
706.0,Provider,"To not think about it. I want them to think about, but you were looking at it, as you not losing something but gaining something. So, because you lost that you're gaining something else, look at this relationship you're rebuilding with your husband. The gap fun times you're getting to have with him, you know if you had to choose between the two. You would choose him every time."
10125.0,Patient,"Oh yeah and I enjoy myself much more like when we're doing things together, we for like you're always thinking about like when can I get back home and get high or when can I, you know. yeah it's always on your mind and it's always like a. it's like you're cheating on your husband or your family. Go with with thing all the time because you're never really present thinking about that all the time yeah which is just. You know not good, and now I was able to just really it's such a weight left, just like now, I can really focus on this and i'm not worried about anything else you know and i'm present here with you and we're. Having a good time and I really enjoyed myself at night, so it was really good."
706.0,Provider,"Good and and that's important and just knowing that you can enjoy life without having a substance, you can enjoy life to you know, to the to the extreme, like you, you can enjoy everything and has to offer you don't need something else to help you do that. Now you know you don't need that and you don't necessarily need it anymore for the energy, because you get to relax a little bit, you know that you don't have to go go go go go go anymore. Right things at your own pace, when you want to and they know that was a big reason that was kind of like your pick me up to keep going. yeah really need that anymore. and You know, you have the time now to look at getting your ADHD tests done so that you can see if that's, an action that you need to figure out how to handle that so that your brain doesn't spider web and 1700 directions, all the time. All of those things you have that time now, you know that's what we talked last time about that gift of time, you know you can literally sit down and make a list of things that you want to do in the next month, and you can do them all, because you have that time."
10125.0,Patient,I do.
706.0,Provider,"You know. yeah there's a lot of moms would like to trade places with you for like a day, but you have time."
10125.0,Patient,"yeah it's great it's good. And i'm I feel like it's really nice to like when you have a bunch of things to do, then you can actually accomplish them and not feel like you're half doing anything like i'm really doing it doing a good job of it like. my daughter, we found out she has hemophilia a or vine world of brands, which is like a blood disorder and it's it's not as serious as haemophiliac but she. believes a lot of time, so they have for shapewear medical bracelet and I ordered it too small so it's like kind of tight on her so she told me one day. Just this weekend about how it was just a little too stuck and I go Okay, and so Monday or Tuesday Tuesday I said, your braces will be here in five days she's like you already ordered it. I got on the third Monday. I got on the Horn right away and reordered it what she's like I haven't I figured it would take a little bit like you know. got other things to do, and I just figured this out an emergency because it's just a little snug i'm like no I just took care of it, so that your dental appointment made in this you."
706.0,Provider,Know it's like.
10125.0,Patient,"So I feel a lot less scatterbrained lately, so I don't have three calendars but that's Okay, I can do that, that I need to I have literally three calendars because I write it down write it down what am I first one, a ham and then I just had like another one that I just reference because. i'm forgetful, but a lot of that was the drugs so that's getting better."
706.0,Provider,"Definitely, and if you need that those are all tools to be successful, you know um but I mean you get you have all of this, you know time, so you know you typically do the cooking and the cleaning and stuff and you know. Rather than take all that on yourself, maybe because those are things all have to be done anyway, but you know, maybe you know cook dinner with your husband's i'm night you don't have to eat at a specific time anymore, because there's no kids at home."
10125.0,Patient,So right you.
706.0,Provider,When he gets home from work cook dinner together and make a really nice dinner and sit down and you know eat by candlelight and you know be.
10125.0,Patient,at home. Because yeah.
706.0,Provider,You don't have any concern.
10125.0,Patient,"I did say to me, the other day because she's off work on Wednesdays, I said why Wednesdays I just said this to him. A couple days ago I said every Wednesday, I want to all three to have dinner together and make to if he can make it will text neck and tell him. Wednesdays at our houses family dinner you commerce don't whatever but i'm clicking on Wednesdays everybody's eating together, because just to check in. All busy with different direction, sometimes my husband has I jobs and she's working and has her homework, I just want one night, where we sit down and just regroup with each other, and you know dial in and see what's going on. yeah and then you know we can do still do dinners other nights too, but I just think my mom always said dinner was really important and I felt like it was."
706.0,Provider,"Because it is the time to connect and. you're right, because if there's something going on with your kids."
10125.0,Patient,You might not get out.
706.0,Provider,You will you may not know and they're going to be more comfortable coming to you if you have that regular check in.
10125.0,Patient,"Give them that platform to this day, or it just gives you a moment to look at your kid and really look at them and say, are you okay. because sometimes she comes home from school eat something real fast changes your class she's out the door and back home. she'll eat something for dinner, whatever it cooked or whatever will heat it up and then she's doing her homework and I don't really get a chance to like the tour sometimes. yeah like really talked to her. This morning. This morning, she said. She was really overwhelmed about school, so I literally six o'clock in the morning, she was. blow dry in her hair and I was reading to her out of her book from school so she could blow dry your hair and I, you know, I was just trying to help her out like. Here i'll read you these pages from your book just to spend some time with her, you know. she's so overwhelmed with school so it's just Nice that I want to be able to just look at her, she worries me she's got a CD like pretty pretty significant STD and she doesn't do man she's very anti meds still. i've told her like it's Okay, if you need them you feel like you get to that point it's okay to do that, but she's she's very good at using like her therapy tools and stuff like."
706.0,Provider,She has.
10125.0,Patient,"But I have to stay connected because she's highly susceptible to eating disorder. So that worries me a lot, because I can see, sometimes she'll look in the mirror before she and then after she and I asked her about it all the time which I don't know I just like to see I don't know I just I gotta pay really close to her for that you know, to get out I."
706.0,Provider,was like you should go away to college and then you lose that ability to keep an eye on her all the time.
10125.0,Patient,and societies pretty rough right now out there and I think. That how to be her age in this time day. will be really hard with social media and.
706.0,Provider,eating disorders are not about how you look.
10125.0,Patient,"Now. it's about control and that's what a CD is that's exactly why they've been telling me that she was diagnosed at age seven that that's one of the things that. Typically, girls turn to is an eating disorder, with a CD because you guys it's easy to control it, and nobody can notice sometimes and secret. and it's something that, if nothing else. is going your way you can control that you know everything."
706.0,Provider,"In the world is chaotic, you can control what food you put into your mouth yes."
10125.0,Patient,Yes.
706.0,Provider,"No i'm The one thing that you should do that I would maybe suggest when you have your family dinners is steal a page out of my group book. and have everybody every Wednesday talk about something great that happened that week, because that is a time of celebration that's a time with come together. You know, like tell me tell me one really great thing that happened this last week in your life, you know because I want to know because I don't see you every day as much anymore so tell me tell me some great things about your life, you know, and so, then that makes them. feel very loved and appreciated like oh my gosh you know, like they really care they want to know you know and then also you know. If there's anything you know that you're struggling with know that you know we're here for you, you know and just leave it at that you know it doesn't have to be a family discussion, but just to let them know that you know i'm here for you."
10125.0,Patient,You know that's a great idea yeah.
706.0,Provider,You know just that those little reminders because sometimes that's all it takes for young adults is just to hear that there's somebody there that's there that's non judgmental and very open and then you know they can they can come to.
10125.0,Patient,I think that's really.
706.0,Provider,You know and. You know that will that will former a special kind of bond.
10125.0,Patient,"Yes, and I think that will always let her know that no matter what she can come to us and talk to us and she's always kind of had that good relationship with us, where she feels sometimes she tells me too much. You know, but i'm grateful because a lot of her friends come to me for things and it's not because i'm like the book i'm never going to be that cool parent because i'm not her friend, but. I don't know, I guess, I just have like that I guess i'm easy to talk I don't know her friends just say I mean it's here to talk to them their mom. And i'm like like I think it's because i'm not your mom that's what makes it easy, I guess, but mason's like now I don't it's not hard to talk to you, I can she definitely feels comfortable talking to me, but I think she had like for me to like the eating thing I worry about a lot and. I think she hides how much of fathers are but we'll just have to deal with that when it comes so knowing ahead of time is good uh huh. yeah that's a great idea I think i'm gonna try that."
706.0,Provider,"yep I think that'd be really great and they make it fine you know, like Mexican theme night, you know, like and you have tacos or you know. come up with like cool little things and maybe even you know send your daughter's off on Wednesdays Maybe she can even help you to cook dinner so maybe some special time that you guys can spend together."
10125.0,Patient,"And we've actually talked about that, like learning how to do laundry and you know household stuff because I haven't been so great about teaching her that kind of stuff and. Yes. So now i'm like. You know, we really should kind of touch on that night, let me show you how to clean the tile in the bathroom one time or show you how to do the laundry and separate it. and get a stain out or whatever. And she's like yeah I was like that so. yeah because those are all I so."
706.0,Provider,You can take with her.
10125.0,Patient,"I still tweet her eyebrows. yoga moggy to eyebrows i'm like what are you gonna do when you're 30 come over here, and please your eyebrows she's like yeah I like how you do it like Okay, well, I think that's a good yeah."
706.0,Provider,"Maybe maybe you should teach her how to do that, like all of those things that you know to maybe Wednesday can be that day that you know you get to do things together, like. Good quality things that she needs to know you know, like like I said, you know even helping you cook dinner number one at D stigmatizes food, so it makes food less of an object and more of an normal thing, so it doesn't need to feel so controlled. So they tell you know they tell people with eating disorders, whether it be like overeating or under eating. To help prepare the food, because then your control is in preparing the food and not consuming the food."
10125.0,Patient,"Good point like that i'm going to say that her yeah she's she recently became well not recently like six months ago she said she wanted to be vegetarian uh huh and I supported her and but I said, we have to be careful that we keep the nutrients so."
706.0,Provider,The protein.
10125.0,Patient,"yeah, and so we do protein shakes sometimes if she's not been getting a lot and she's trying different foods, though, that she never tried before we bought protein noodles you know things like that and taking my vitamins and I make I make her all kinds of like smoothies and stuff. So, but she kind of like loves it and she kind of says she feels better so. Well, I."
706.0,Provider,"feel better have all that excess fat and stuff floating in there. So yeah um so maybe get like a vegetarian cookbook and. start making some some cool recipes and you know you might find something that you know and but your whole family likes it doesn't even know it's vegetarian that's the fun part. When you can like every oh that was so good and be like oh yeah, by the way, there was no meat in there and it's it's completely vegetarian you. You know I. used to do that used to be quite stuff with like ground Turkey, you know cuz everybody's like oh ground. same as like ground beef and I was like oh yeah yeah yeah you know and then. i'll make spaghetti with it, or something like that and oh my gosh that was so good i'm like yeah there is ground Turkey in there and not grumpy if, like you, didn't even know the difference and. it's the same thing with the lake a lot of the like the bulk of meats, and like the tofu meats and stuff like that that kind of replaced the meat but still have that same texture some people don't know so."
10125.0,Patient,"Maybe kind of a fun really I haven't. I haven't ventured there yet i've seen it. Now, and I thought about it, I really want to do some stuff with black beans. You know, like. You can you can order like a three way with black being really good i've had it, but she won't do the beans yet and i'm like what you should really try them, I mean that is a great source. of you for vegetarian people and i'm like and you can do so much with. me, I mean I could do like a chili we could do like tacos with rice and black me and you would just really like it, I think. yeah I love you. I think they're really good."
706.0,Provider,"yeah so maybe that's something that that you guys, can you know do together, maybe. Get that. Like vegetarian cookbook and. Just start creating things. you're on mute."
10125.0,Patient,you're on mute sorry.
706.0,Provider,"There you go. that's okay so i'm i've got another appointment waiting, but you have some do you have something scheduled here and a couple weeks."
10125.0,Patient,"not yet. Okay, I do, how did you have an appointment waiting i'll call care navigation, because they they never have it when you and I do it anyway so i'll just go ahead and schedule with that."
706.0,Provider,"I don't know. I don't know what the problem with that is either I finally asked my boss, the other day i'm like, why is it when I schedule in the system, it doesn't show up in the main system and she's like. she's like I don't know she she says, you know, sometimes when it goes through, they forget to click you as the provider and if they. Forget to do that, then it doesn't come up on my calendar, the main calendar it just it's kind of floating out there and I said Okay, and that actually happened yesterday and I got a message and said. You are so and so appointments here, but it wasn't on your calendar, because you weren't clicked as the provider, can you still see them and I had space, so I saw them, but I think it's just because we have some newer people you know because. We keep growing and growing, because obviously there's such a need, and you know there's not very many Tele health type substance abuse programs don't even know if there is any others besides bret Hart."
10125.0,Patient,And I haven't.
706.0,Provider,"yeah so we're just growing and growing and growing, so I think when we hire new or care navigators just like with any position people have little bumps in the road, as are trying to learn their job so."
10125.0,Patient,"Hopefully it doesn't really. None of that stuff really bothers me too much, I mean mo just gets on there and tells me. You know, you need to schedule a Stacy and i'm like I already am and he's like okay i'm like I don't see the big deal in that people get so. Mad like in group I didn't get you know, I was told I had to do this survey and I already did it who cares just yeah let me already did it like what's that yeah. yeah I. people get so upset."
706.0,Provider,"And that's why we have the care navigators now in groups so. You know that was kind of a new thing you know just that's happened in the last few months, where they come to group. And that's the reason, so they can say you know you can talk to them about you ways and surveys and scheduling and all of that, because. One of the chief complaints of a lot of the patients was when you go into the vc clinic sometimes it takes a really long time because there's so there's so many people that need stuff and not enough obviously staff. You know, and so even even as you try and build staff, sometimes you know you have to wait and people kind of get irritated they don't like it so. This you know you have to go to group anyway, so what better way to kind of kill two birds with one stone is to have your care navigator in there that can make all of those adjustments right then. And all the leaders that are in the group, are you know seasoned once they've been here a while they know what the right."
10125.0,Patient,You know. Most can hear ya.
706.0,Provider,yeah the most really great and like he makes sure that all this stuff gets done so yeah.
10125.0,Patient,"I definitely I think everybody's great i've not met one person that isn't sweet to me totally consider it and just I mean we've had a little couple problems with appointments to. Maybe i'm gonna let you get your appointment, though. And i'll just. pause agile with them okay. Okay. Take care two weeks, then."
706.0,Provider,Two weeks.
