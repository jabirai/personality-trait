3783.0,Patient,"I know. Everything is going pretty good. I. only see what all has been going on since last time. I. Go I think I think the thing that i'm struggling with right now is my relationship with my granddaughter. And I think my husband has a huge role to play, that plays into all that. And, and so. him and I have. talked about it and he's he's willing to to make some changes because it's really disrupting the mine and my granddaughter's relationship."
99.0,Provider,I kind of remember maybe a little bit like he cute he you're the one that sets the limits and he doesn't really and. uh huh.
3783.0,Patient,"yeah well and not just that but um he spoils her a lot and so and that's, not to say that I don't spoil her but um. You know, I do have I do put my foot down, and you know and make sure that. I set those limits for her because well she's four and she's a lot, like her mom I mean like. i'm. Like through through she's like her mom and and so that."
99.0,Provider,you're familiar.
3783.0,Patient,"yeah, I am very familiar with this and the behavior really um has gotten out of control, with her. And so i'm kind of I kind of feel like i'm at this crossroads with her, where I just don't know what to do, anymore, you know what I mean I don't um but she's she said some really nasty things about me, you know and i'm."
99.0,Provider,Your granddaughter.
3783.0,Patient,"mm hmm. Oh yeah this just this last week, she called me a monster, she said that I was a monster, because I was um because I gotten upset with her about something that she was doing and and all of a sudden, I became a monster, and that came out of her mouth and. And it's it's been it's been hard you know, to hear that is. Really hurtful you know um and or. If I get angry with her and raise my voice with her she'll tell me that she's gonna call the police on me and i'm like I don't even know where that comes from like that to me is like. completely out there."
99.0,Provider,sounds very manipulative for sure.
3783.0,Patient,"yeah yeah and she's earned her. Just like her mom in that in that aspect you know and like it's just a mini version of her mother. makes it really difficult to deal with her, because I really. had a real hard time with my daughter. You know and. So. i'm um and speaking of which. I my husband and I went round about. Seeing seeing my daughter and and you know. Trying to make an effort he wanted me to make an effort to. reassess reestablish our relationship and try to work things through a term plan took me a while to come to that point, you know because I wasn't going to. And you know and spoken to her and about in two years, and I really hadn't planned on talking to her at all I didn't want to talk to her to one out that. I didn't want to have to deal with that anymore. But, of course, you know, again I let down my guard and. And decided Okay, you know cuz. aaliyah my granddaughter decided that she wanted to ask me. For a little a little sister."
99.0,Provider,Oh.
3783.0,Patient,"Oh that's not happening, and so you know my husband thought. Well, she needs to know that she's got one already you know and and that, if any, if she's going to have relationship with any of our sisters, it would be that one. You know her younger sister. Because the other two are adopted and. So who knows what's happened with them, you know now i'm. And so I wanted to do that for my granddaughter you know to be able to have that relationship I didn't quite know how I was going to do it, you know. Because i've already come to this part in my life, where i'm. Just not wanting to deal with it anymore and i'm inside really battled a lot with not only him, but with myself to you know and and feeling that guilt. For or. for keeping her from her sister, you know what I mean like I like I felt I was the cause of that you know because of where I was in my life and and in my thought process. It made it real hard for me to be able to to come to that decision, you know. But I did and. Like and then all of a sudden, she just dropped off the face of the year or something I don't know like we had talked a few times and i'm we were gonna we were trying to work things out to where we could. Sit down, you know, I was going to take her out to lunch and. And just talk, you know I wasn't gonna bring my daughter. It was just gonna be her and I and. Where we could talk about you know what's happened what I feel needs to happen and um and then like she just completely like I said, like just dropped off."
99.0,Provider,"Well, not sure what's going on with erica's reception, I wanted to update her treatment plan today. because everything is outdated since May all of her target dates are from back at the end of May. And July of this year, so if she doesn't come back in. 1015 minutes let's just say that attempted to update treatment plan, but client. Her reception dropped so i'm going to pause the recording for now, and hopefully she'll come back. This is for whoever's transcribing things."
3783.0,Patient,"I think. I think there's a storm moving in, and so I I was having problems trying to check into arose getting cut off, so I apologize for that. I think it's interfering with my my Internet."
99.0,Provider,"yeah I get it, we had a really bad storm a couple days ago, so I."
3783.0,Patient,"heard a guy that's know and everything out there, I was like what."
99.0,Provider,"I know totally well you know snow it's not that unusual on the big island, but it was it was a bad blizzard and it was a really bad storm thankfully i'm Okay, where I live, but. Some of my friends up the mountain got hit super hard and have been out of power for three days and it's been a deal for sure."
3783.0,Patient,"yeah I heard that you guys are getting a blizzard out though it was like in Hawaii and I, I guess, maybe I never really paid any attention to it before, but I was like in Hawaii now way, and then I thought of you immediately, I was, like, I wonder, Dominique steps, no."
99.0,Provider,"Not where I live, it's quite sunny right now yeah."
3783.0,Patient,"I know I can see, I always. I always get jealous cuz oh so like you can see, when the your curtain sway you can see that the cheese and stuff outside like. I live in a bunch of dirt."
99.0,Provider,"I know I lived in new Mexico for like six years and love left it very much and I need I need a little more moisture in my life for sure. um so Eric I really I want to hear more about your daughter, and I also want to take advantage of the time that we have the. The reception and we just need to update your treatment plan really quickly, can we do that, then get back to your doctor. yeah Okay, so the last time we did anything was back in May and even before me, because it your target dates were may 31 so let's just touch in with some of these goals, I think we can get through it quickly and then. we'll move on to what you want to talk about. So one of them was to stop smoking cigarettes and you were going to contact a quit line to assisting in that didn't have to do it."
3783.0,Patient,"I haven't I I still smoke, but i've cut down on lot. yeah."
99.0,Provider,"Okay, great so you've cut down a lot but let's um let's think about what. Just i'm just looking here, so it says monthly individual sessions so let's let's let's set up another session per month from now and then i'll check in what's a realistic goal one month one month from now that you can meet with your cigarette."
3783.0,Patient,I can. I can go down to probably about half a pack a day.
99.0,Provider,Okay.
3783.0,Patient,Oh.
99.0,Provider,Go ahead.
3783.0,Patient,that's that's quite a bit for me.
99.0,Provider,Okay.
3783.0,Patient,"So let's think I started smoking a whole lot like I was really, I think, with all the stress and everything and I started smoking a whole lot, so I cut back quite a bit, but I think i'd have practice probably a realistic goal for me right now."
99.0,Provider,"Okay, and then i'm just looking at my calendar or Wednesday is good for you."
3783.0,Patient,um. yeah it doesn't really matter yeah but.
99.0,Provider,Okay um so i'm looking I could do 6pm on either the fifth or the 12th of January which which one do.
3783.0,Patient,let's do the 12.
99.0,Provider,"Okay, so so six o'clock does that oh wait no hold on hold on i'm 23455 o'clock five o'clock work for you."
3783.0,Patient,yeah that's fine.
99.0,Provider,"Okay, so i'm going to put you in. For five o'clock on the 12th of January and then for whoever is transcribing, can you please update erica's treatment plan so these new goals will be will check in again on January 12 okay so half a pack all right, how about i'm fully buddy training your granddaughter."
3783.0,Patient,100%.
99.0,Provider,He did it good job okay.
3783.0,Patient,"So why not, you know what I did because I noticed that she was going. pm, the party and then I would put her Pamper on and then she would poop right after I put her Pamper on so as soon as I would get her off the toilet she was in her in a pampered. Well, in a pull up and I was like No, this is why she's looping in and she hasn't gone yet. As soon as I took her out of the pull ups she never had another accident, she never pooped in another Pamper I took her out, and I said nope you should start going to the bathroom on the toilet. And she started going great right away, I was like i've known, this would have been over six months."
99.0,Provider,"Oh, my gosh yeah oh my gosh, it must be such a relief for little into not be walking around with poop in their parents that's."
3783.0,Patient,yeah I imagine it is. Right now.
99.0,Provider,"Oh good okay great so we'll make that as a completed goal. Okay, how about Well, this is an ongoing one but are you still tapering off of the suboxone because it says, you want to continue consistently tapering off."
3783.0,Patient,"yeah I have it anymore, but um that's something I want to talk, talk about and I cuz I think i'm ready to taper down a little bit more."
99.0,Provider,"Okay, so maybe why don't we make that as a goal for January 12 that you've tapered a bit more I don't know how much you guys can decide. Okay Okay, they bring some more okay. um it says attending group weekly and it had have you been or."
3783.0,Patient,"What I go every other week now because my. My because of the way that my mentor but and some because of how I guess the goal side reached in my my treatment, I guess."
99.0,Provider,"Okay, great well will amend that to bi bi weekly. Okay, and then and then how. Definitely keep our individual session for the 12th but does once a month seem good or do you want every six weeks for individual therapy, what would be."
3783.0,Patient,"yeah every six weeks will be fine, I think, and then, if if I you know get to a point where I really need to talk with you, or whatever. i'll make an additional appointment, but I think every system will be fine."
99.0,Provider,"Okay, that sounds great let's just plan on that so we'll change that to to every six weeks because you're doing well. Okay, another one was. Getting a part time job, even if it's from home because."
3783.0,Patient,"I haven't I think i'm right now i'm just trying to because I got my granddaughter and preschool, and so I think i've just really just trying to take a little bit of time just for myself and. Concentrating on me a little bit you know it's been an ongoing you know child rearing. and raising. You know situation, and I mean i'm almost 60 years old and i've never been. Since I started having kids i've never been at a point where I haven't had kids you know, and I haven't raised kids are and other people's kids and um and so now that i've gotten her into school i'm just taking a little time for me."
99.0,Provider,"Okay, great so let's just take that one off and let's not think about the job thing right now i'm well how about getting back into school because that was another bullet you had."
3783.0,Patient,"that's the same thing i'm gonna i'm going to apply for school and spring and so and so by the springtime up i'll be registered back to school. But you know we're right now we don't have Internet at home and so it's all going to have to be worked out that way but yes, I do want to still go back to school."
99.0,Provider,"Okay, well, that can be a longer term golden so how about let's see in the spring, so. How about by April, should we put that goal, just to see where you're at with it by the end of April or May what feels better to."
3783.0,Patient,Here one at the end of April i'm not quite sure when registration is. um but I will. But April sounds like it'd be. A good time.
99.0,Provider,"Okay i'm just gonna look at my calendar to see six weeks like when when that would be it so that I can check in with you, when we do our session in six weeks so let's see so. Here we go 1234561234. Great so let's say let's just say bye bye bye April 15 and then. And then i'll check in with you, before that."
3783.0,Patient,Okay.
99.0,Provider,"Okay, and then that's all that you had so do you want to think of maybe two more goals that by January 12 you can. have set for yourself to me."
3783.0,Patient,wow. I don't know I can't really think of any.
99.0,Provider,"Well, what about um it sounds like you and your husband are working on getting more aligned with child rearing, could you think of something specific that we can check in on around that on January 12."
3783.0,Patient,"um yeah um. let's see um communication has always been kind of difficult with my husband about about this situation, in particular, we talk about a lot. And, and you know we have a pretty good pretty good relationship where we don't fight, but this becomes really contentious between the two of us, because of course nobody ever wants to be wrong, you know what I mean and what they do so, I think. where we can. open up a better line of communication between him and I. Because I. Because, where I that in in this situation, I become very defensive and angry when I have to deal with it, and he becomes very defensive, you know and and. He doesn't feel like he's wrong, and I know that i'm not wrong."
99.0,Provider,In you know you're right.
3783.0,Patient,"Exactly and so i'm just being able to. talk to him differently, I think, and be able to express to him how i'm feeling and how how. How it comes. How I feel in regards to how how i'm being put in the middle of this, so I think just being able to. talk to him better because more than anything, I kind of Mr. accusations and you know and instead of. Trying to be. hold on hold on le. Instead of trying to be more um. How do you put it i'm. More thoughtful I guess you know and. So I think, to try to work on that thoughtful aspect, rather than the accusation aspect."
99.0,Provider,"Okay, so it sounds like being expressing your feelings more being more thought."
3783.0,Patient,On definitely.
99.0,Provider,"Different differently, and do you think bringing a spirit of curiosity to your communication with him would help her to know is that not."
3783.0,Patient,um. I don't I don't know. My but. I don't know.
99.0,Provider,"Okay, so. So I guess I did, how could you get a little more specific with talking to him differently."
3783.0,Patient,i'm just. I think probably. just expressing myself differently i'm in a more positive. And more understanding way you know.
99.0,Provider,"It makes sense, so more positive and understanding, maybe more empathetic would that be accurate. yeah yeah okay."
3783.0,Patient,that's the word I was looking for.
99.0,Provider,"Okay yeah so not curious because sounds like you know you're right. empathetic to where he's coming from, even though you don't agree."
3783.0,Patient,"yeah well he's never had it used to raise a child and so he thinks that if it's it's just giving a child, everything that they want is. is the right thing to do and. I raised my kids to know that that's not the right thing."
99.0,Provider,yeah.
3783.0,Patient,"I know i'm right, but you know i'm. I need to understand you know where he comes from too, but that's not where my mind goes immediately my mind goes to this is frickin wrong and. i'm sorry about this, you know, and I don't want it. I don't want to hear what he has to say, but I think I need to just be more open and i'm as well as. Communicating how I feel differently."
99.0,Provider,"Okay, let me that's clear so more open, more understanding more empathetic in your communication with your husband. Okay okay that could be a goal to check in on oh yeah and."
3783.0,Patient,"I think it's a. Second, a second goal would be on how to work on my relationship with my granddaughter because that's a really hard place where i'm at right now and and they don't really know how how to work through it. Or how how to express her because she's only for you know what I mean and so i'm gonna have to figure out how to how to work through this a little differently with her."
99.0,Provider,"You know I just had an ideas yeah she's only four and I bet she can make art yeah. I wonder if you want to bring her to the next session and do a little art therapy together, and you know with children, they do, they they don't have the the. frontal lobe developed enough to be able to make sense of what they're. feeling, but they can get it out and start working through it, so you know we don't have to any talk therapy with her, but just say hey we're going to draw a little here's an idea, and maybe if you participate with her, you can some something can start happening with you too."
3783.0,Patient,yeah that's actually a really good idea.
99.0,Provider,"yeah Okay, I mean you're welcome to bring her in today, if you want."
3783.0,Patient,"um yeah well. yeah you. Next time, all right now she's involved in her tablet and. I think if I catch it before I get her put on there it's a little bit easier so."
99.0,Provider,Oh yeah definitely and once.
3783.0,Patient,"Once she gets focused on that she's like are we done yet you know, then her focus goes nowhere else but there you know and she's. yeah I don't know right now be a good time should be wanting to go right are we done yet are we done yeah."
99.0,Provider,"yeah that makes sense, well, how do you think in the next until we meet again, what do you think you can do to work on her relationship just getting really specific because that's. that's a really important thing with goals is getting like realistic and specific with what you want to do so, it doesn't just stay kind of nebulous and vague and then nothing happens."
3783.0,Patient,sorry about that.
99.0,Provider,yeah.
3783.0,Patient,"yeah I think i'm just. uh I think just trying to. I don't I don't know that like I said that's something that i'm just gonna have to figure out how to work it through, because i'm not really i'm kind of stumped honestly. You know that's why I want it to be a goal, because i'm right now i'm at a loss, you know I i've tried display that way, and the other ways, you know, to try to reach her to try to talk to her try to. Work it work this through her, but I don't really know so i'm i'm kind of at a loss."
99.0,Provider,"So maybe the goal would be to to just get some clarity on how to work with maybe you don't know yet, but in the next month thinking about different strategies. on how to. yeah improve your relationship with her."
3783.0,Patient,"yeah yeah cuz it does get it is really hard for me to be in position you know. um and I don't want to overwhelm her either you know what I mean with with adult thoughts and feelings, you know. It was. Something that she doesn't have any clue what that is you know so we're that i'm crying or that i'm angry, or you know Whatever the case may be, at that, at that moment. um and so. Like I said I don't really know how but i'm gonna figure it out. And that is a goal."
99.0,Provider,"degree. Well, that does that sound like a good amount of goals for the next. um yeah well over month before we meet again."
3783.0,Patient,yeah I think.
99.0,Provider,"That seems good. What do you want to tell me more about your daughter, and how how that went."
3783.0,Patient,"Well i'm like I said, you know her and I had. planned on on."
99.0,Provider,"I think reception is not. doing well today, maybe we'll just call it a day. For her session if she doesn't Come on, in the next five minutes. hi."
3783.0,Patient,"Sorry, Dominique."
99.0,Provider,"yeah it's Okay, it seems like the receptions really tough today."
3783.0,Patient,"yeah and even when I learned when when we're talking our voices are crackling and so. yeah like I said there's that storm moving in so but anyway um I am I guess. Really, what I wanted to talk to her about was just trying to figure out, you know what what we could do, as far as you know, first Elio be five in July, and when we took custody of her when we took guardianship of her. The judge told us that we could think about adopting her if her mother hadn't you know i'm on her back by the time she was five, and so you know I wanted to talk to her about that and talk to her about having. You know. A taking part in eva's life, which is the baby. And how Ali could be a part of the of her life, you know what I mean, because at this point I don't really know you know I didn't really know whether or not I would have my daughter. Be apart, but I knew I wanted to have the girls together, you know what I mean, but they didn't really know how to work that out either."
99.0,Provider,And thinking of potentially taking guardianship of Eva as well.
3783.0,Patient,"I don't know not Eva i'm just having visitation with her and and being able to have either an alley get to know each other, you know and but uh. We had set up a couple of lunch dates and for whatever reason, on her APP on her end or my end. It just never worked out and so. And then, all of a sudden, she just dropped off the face of the earth like she never called me back and I. Right now, I am at the point where i'm not gonna go chasing that you know what I mean i'm not if i'm if it's important enough for her to because she she talks to my husband every now and then. and has been for for a very long time, but. I figured that if it's important enough for her. To for the girls to have relationship and because that's what she told my husband that she wanted the girls have relationship and get to know each other and all that I figured that she would you know make that effort but. apparently not. yeah so. You know I guess at this point I just i'm done trying, you know i'm not gonna go chasing her around you know if she if it if she wants this she's gonna have to fix it she's gonna have to make it happen because you know i've already i've already compromised what. i'm what I had said in my own mind that I wasn't going to do you know, and so I already compromised on that and. And so. I I just I guess I just feel the same way, I always feel and with her is is you know she's a letdown you know, and she selfish and um and doesn't care about anybody else but or so. So I don't know what happened to her, but. Again, like I said i'm not i'm not chasing her around anymore i'm not gonna."
99.0,Provider,Try to.
3783.0,Patient,"Try to put myself out there, for her anymore, you know i'm already Casa."
99.0,Provider,"yeah. Well, I did have a thought is aaliyah very clear and understanding that you're her grandma and that she has a mom out there that. isn't in the picture."
3783.0,Patient,"yeah Oh, I have pictures up on her. yeah it's not it's not a secret. You know I don't. um and but the only thing that she remembers about her is that she's not a very nice person. um."
99.0,Provider,"I just wonder what might come up for her, and if you guys do get in touch with your daughter and. Eva and see them, I wonder what's going to get stirred up for her that you know why does this other little girl get to be with mom. got to and what you know anyways just a thought that something that maybe with the art therapy might be something to to to look at."
3783.0,Patient,"yeah and I thought about that too, you know. I think la already knows she's already. I mean she's been with us since she was born, you know, but that doesn't mean that things wouldn't come up for her, but I think she's under the clear understanding that you know we are her parents, you know what I mean even know where her grandparents. yeah yeah and you know she's she's called me mom you know every once in a while she'll she'll call me mom or whatever, but um. that's not something that I taught her to do and I, you know don't really encourage it, but I mean i'm not gonna deny her. from doing a you know i'm not going to keep her from doing it either you know what I mean. Then."
99.0,Provider,Because.
3783.0,Patient,"she's five we're going to adopt her period because it's obvious that. my daughter doesn't you know doesn't want to take on that responsibility and so. yeah I don't know if I thought that point well we'll let you let her not. So difficult because she's or you know what I mean it's so hard to try to figure out what you can and what you can't tell tell him. Because you want to tell them everything you know what I mean and you want them to understand the way that you understand and and accept things the way that you accept things but they can't because they're only for you know and. yeah so whether or not she would even understand what adoption means at this point in her life, you know I don't know but."
99.0,Provider,I don't think so.
3783.0,Patient,"yeah yeah. So you've been trying to explain that to her, it would be kind of just a waste of time, but. For now, anyway, until she gets a little bit older and understands it, you know it gets to the point, it gets to the age where we can talk to her, you know and and explained to her that. I guess when when when that happens, I just want her to know that we are her permanent people you know what I mean what regardless whether we're her grandparents, or you know we're her parents or or you know at that point. we're just going to be her permanent people."
99.0,Provider,yeah where your primitive people that sounds really good.
3783.0,Patient,"And, and you know that we're not going to go anywhere so. I don't know but, again, like I said i've tried. keep trying, you know and in hopes that. that something will click in my daughter's brain, but as of yet it hasn't been. We my husband and I did fight over it for quite a while, because he kept telling me that you know, maybe the girls need to see to. see each other, they need to be a part of each other's lives and and I kept telling him I I i'm not ready for that you know i'm just I can't put myself in that place and. And he couldn't understand because he's he hasn't had to deal with her the way that I have you know in in same manner and in the same uh you know abusive. With the same abusive behavior that that I have to you know and so. We went rounds over it, and i'm and I finally know that okay well, maybe, especially when she started asking me for a little sister I was like whoa wait a minute."
99.0,Provider,yeah that.
3783.0,Patient,That factory is closing.
99.0,Provider,um.
3783.0,Patient,"So I tried to figure out how how to go about it differently, you know um. But. It was just another waste of time and another disappointment and. But i'm not i'm not wounded about it for me i'm already i've already dealt with all that you know, and thanks to you you've been a huge help, and you know it's been a really, really difficult to deal with her, you know psychologically but. I have, I I do feel like i've come to that that place in my life, where i've come to. i'm i'm peaceful about it now, you know what I mean this decision that I made."
99.0,Provider,a glut i'm so glad that whatever whether it's in their individual or the groups or whatever that that you've gotten something that's really helped you with dealing with this.
3783.0,Patient,"yeah um. It really has been helpful be. Because it's the group helps me i'm. in a different way, but it's been our individual therapy, because this is not the first time that you and I have talked about this, we talked about this several times and. you've always given me good advice and and good guidance and and and that's been really helpful, especially with the situation that this painful you know what I mean or that can be that can be painful. And and disruptive for me mentally um but i'm made peace with it, I just was hoping that something in her would snap you know. on behalf of her daughters, you know, and I mean but. um yeah that that was a a Dallas another disappointment, it just kinda was like. Okay well. Here I go trying again, and what I get for trying so it's not her fault it's just disappointing, you know because I I wanted I wanted that for her you know what I mean, and I, and I compromised a lot to to be able to try to give that to her."
99.0,Provider,"yeah to reach out and because it's vulnerable for you to I imagine you know you've gone through a lot of pain of letting go and just letting it be, and now you're reaching out again so yeah."
3783.0,Patient,"yeah and opening up opening that vulnerable spot you know and i'm in it and it wasn't an easy choice it wasn't. I like I told my husband to it, I don't even know what I was gonna say to her, you know when we went. When I took her for lunch to talk to her, I had no idea what I was going to talk to her about I knew what I wanted to say, you know, but whether or not that would actually have come out or even how it would have come out I don't know but um. Because it was something really that I had geared up, for you know you know because I had already a close that chapter and input that but boy, you know what I mean, I have to say here and and. i'm and try to figure out what it was that I was going to say to her. Or how I would how I would go about seeing it. was a whole nother so maybe it was that was good it that it didn't happen because I didn't really know how to work through that either you know, this is all been really, really complicated but i'm. Here you know."
99.0,Provider,"Erica yeah here we are, I have a book, I want to share with you that I started reading and it's really wonderful and even though you know you've gone through raising your own children, you are raising another child now and. I don't know I just felt compelled to share it's been really illuminating."
3783.0,Patient,artwork i'm not as beautiful.
99.0,Provider,mm hmm.
3783.0,Patient,I have to look into that.
99.0,Provider,"yeah. Because it's such a complex journey of you know. Doing this what you're doing and you've had you've had these different experiences. This might be just help illuminate more of what you're you're sifting through and continue to sift through. Oh, my God. you're you got kind of frozen, but I didn't realize, you were frozen, I thought you were just writing something down and then I realized wait her eyeballs aren't moving."
3783.0,Patient,"I was, I was just getting ready to go and pick up a piece of paper, so that I can write that I don't know. Okay yeah this is, this is a completely different, for me, and this this journey with my granddaughter um. Because I am. I just really, I think, maybe it's because. i'm because i'm older and because i'm a grandmother and i'm in just a different place. It has been completely. Okay, I got it no."
99.0,Provider,"Okay, great good, well, I hope it serves you in some way, if you choose to get it."
3783.0,Patient,"I will definitely look into it um yeah the whole dynamics is totally different um with with my granddaughter I mean, I guess, in a way, I kind of went through the same situation with my sister when I read my niece um but uh. I had, I had a my brother, not in my brother in law that was around someone you know what I mean and so she did kind of have her dad there um. But it, I guess, in a way, it was a little the same, but in a way it's so much different you know completely different but. Now working work through it."
