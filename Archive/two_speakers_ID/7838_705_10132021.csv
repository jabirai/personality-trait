705.0,Provider,Very good drinking some hot tea what happened to our weather.
7838.0,Patient,I know what's happening.
705.0,Provider,I know it's really windy here.
7838.0,Patient,So crazy it's like. As blue sky without a cloud in it which means it's windy.
705.0,Provider,"I know right. yeah oh. I think one of the times you and I were going to meet you were feeling under the weather, are you better now."
7838.0,Patient,i'm better now. I still go to the doctor for my rest but. i'm feeling better yeah I just went to the spirit world was not just like every day. I joke I joke that maybe I was having my own brand baby.
705.0,Provider,girl. Oh.
7838.0,Patient,"Well, you know that's your option. it's like what is happening, I can be nauseous every day. My doctor gave me a pill, so I checked it for five days that you get morning and night, and so that may it's you know it didn't completely take it away, but it certainly made it better than it is."
705.0,Provider,So odd because you haven't had this before.
7838.0,Patient,"i've never had this before now, now I have stomach problems like we talked about in group so since I was 12 and so, if I need to have a bowel movement Sometimes I feel nauseous. But it's not an all day thing."
705.0,Provider,wow. like this is no time.
7838.0,Patient,No it's like what I probably I probably should have taken whatever it's called it's right here on my shelf Merrill X and got rid of everything see if that fixed it.
705.0,Provider,hey if that's gonna work for you it's trying to find something because being nauseous all day long is no fun.
7838.0,Patient,"And if somebody somebody sent them in our group yesterday, and since my tail was not particularly successful I didn't type it."
705.0,Provider,"I know, with the winds different people are having Internet problems and It just seems like there's some, but you you're a pro at this, you know to reconnect if you need to."
7838.0,Patient,"Absolutely, but thankfully the in this House the wi fi boxes in the living room, so I can get to it so i'm not intruding on a couple's private time or anything like that, and they never believe me that the internet's down, they have to discover it for themselves. Oh well, it's like seriously on the Internet, all day if it's down. I know it sounds. Not very detail oriented. Yes, well, I was gonna say I was a. admin assistant, and so I know when someone went to the bathroom I knew when someone had a meeting I knew when. You know, I was the best rapper of like ups and fedex boxes in the building and it was the biggest building in beverly hills, so that same thing. yeah and so yeah so now my my details skills are finding out that the cat has worms and. Really, both important."
705.0,Provider,"Well, you have advanced skills and then you can zone it back when you only need you know with the pets and being able to see what's happening. well."
7838.0,Patient,"So crazy, so I saw Victoria, yesterday I went with her she's at amp T store and I had basically killed my iPhone eight because I had had the battery case on it apparently battery cases are very bad are not supposed to ever use them, because they turn in your battery which. In something I knew or Google or anything else."
705.0,Provider,You know where that either.
7838.0,Patient,"yeah I had no idea they're like please don't put it on its I believe me, it killed by phone when i'm not gonna put it on. And so I don't think it would fit this phone anyway, so I downgraded it's on now from the to the EAS, but as long as it's a working phone and it's victoria's mother late mother's phone. So I said, I have to have your password to completely change it over to myself, because it has my name. But it's still has her email won't let me do certain things. And so I got the fat prejudice going to at amp T she just you know ran with it, you know it's like. She laughs at me that I like celebrity use that I like actors that day and bands and things, but you know supposedly she went to a private school and supposedly you know every she's she's like a politician, if your mouth is moving she's lying so. So she can't you know it's like I know we're really well and she you know she hates herself so she was the size 14 so now she's thinner but she wasn't size 14 the entire six and a half years that I knew her and that's. newsflash that's that's plus size. And so, she gave me so many this big story about her cal well too and her going to school with raquel welch his daughter and raquel welch looks like hell now she's so she's wearing a mouth, the outfit or whatever it was. Like oh my God, you know I accept myself the way I am all women in my family both sides got to a certain age and became a certain weight. And i've read a book called fat so and 80% 80% of weight is biology."
705.0,Provider,mm hmm.
7838.0,Patient,"Now I was thinking my entire life until I got administrative job and I sit on my butt. So you know it's the way it is, I, like the way I look I model my clothes I don't I don't have a problem with it, I embrace it. Absolutely, and I, you know I think I believe in a body positivity and so just her you know she won't I can shut up about that she hates he hates herself. She contradicts anything I say you know if I make a statement, God forbid, or I make a suggestion you know it's like you know she doesn't know our common sense, which is dangerous i'm sorry that's just a trust. it's you know one by 194 earthquake happened, I was living with two sisters and they were they were my friends. And I thought I knew them very well, but living with someone you find out big miss, so the earthquake happened our powers out and our gas was out in our water without all that stuff. They weren't like candles for light I said you like candles i'm leaving because you will burn the place down because we're having aftershocks every few minutes is there's the epicenter of the 94 hours quick. Like. How stupid, do you have to be not to figure out shaking and candles don't go together."
705.0,Provider,it's.
7838.0,Patient,Not slacking intelligence its lack of common.
705.0,Provider,sense yeah you grew up in California.
7838.0,Patient,I am a native i'm a native third generation on my mother's side. yeah.
705.0,Provider,"you're probably used to all this to where like yeah you taken that into consideration, where they not from California."
7838.0,Patient,"California, they were from the valley, I was raised in orange county, but they were you know."
705.0,Provider,It just didn't connect the two.
7838.0,Patient,"Well, you know I think they were born like right maybe before or during like at the time of the 71 earthquake, some are earthquake, so you know I think one was 60 911 71. So they have no reference. You know, but um yeah it's just like a cow and I had a male roommates that left candles and attended in the bathroom I said you so I looked up at article. And said he you can't do that because it can lead to fire."
705.0,Provider,"Yes, candles do burn."
7838.0,Patient,candles subaru station have. Like little tea kettles and it's like what Why are people trying to kill me with fire I don't understand i'm terrified of fire like stop trying to kill me.
705.0,Provider,"yeah it goes back though Carroll to also you're more aware and that you were talking about even with your type of job as you had to pay attention to details. And you have to think it through where others don't have that skill so you're like thinking it through already wait a minute it for lighting candles we have aftershocks not a good mix. yeah. And I wanted to say, too, is it's good that you are very confident and you are very much like embracing that we all come in different sizes, we all are never going to be like you said with genetics it's like yes as being able to be like. I am my authentic self this is me and i'm comfortable where i'm at it's good role model for you know your your friend, that is, maybe having time you know, a tough time struggling and not being confident, where she has."
7838.0,Patient,"asked for, and you know she really needs me right now, because you know her mother died her father died, I think, in 2007 her son died in between those two so she and then she was divorced so there's like these four things that happens we're back to back. Now she was separated from her husband off and on for 10 years so. It wasn't it wasn't a shock that she divorced that he asked for divorce, because he wanted to marry someone else but i'm you know i'm sure that hurt hurt her ego that you know she didn't understand why they weren't celebrating their anniversary it's like. Because you've been separated all these share so there's nothing to celebrate. it's like what part of that go to her dad yeah so i'm so grateful that I had down to earth parents and and have common sense and I believe in individualism, I think. You know, to me, too many people strive to be the same, and I was that way in high school, I was very, very low self esteem and I was headed King high school, so I just wanted to wallpaper. I didn't want anyone to notice me I dress like everyone else, I had my hair long and part in the middle. And it's still my go to sometimes. it's like ah it works if I wanted to be really cute I partnered on one side or so."
705.0,Provider,"Well, in high school to like you were saying you just kind of wanted to blend in and at that age, sometimes it's just like you're so worried about what others are thinking that when you. become into adulthood, where you're like you could care less you're like look I embrace I am I, my uniqueness, is my power."
7838.0,Patient,"yeah it's it's The great thing about growing older, is that you don't care what other people think about you. it's like. You accept yourself as you are you're happiness is a choice. Finding humor things as a choice you don't have to. You know. I want to say complain about everything, but I don't think that's the right term it's just so many people are so negative and it's like why. It doesn't make you happy It makes you miserable to. hate yourself so much and yet she you know it was like, but yet Victoria thanks for time is very valuable and her daughter's time is very valuable. And I took care of the DORSAL that time, not because of them, but because it would have fallen to me anyway, but I love the docs madly, and so I was happy to do it. And you know the person died if the other tenants that live with us, when I first moved in for that first year, she made him take care of the dogs. And he had his own he had two dogs, so it wasn't that problem, but she was so mean she would, if he got home at one o'clock in the morning, she hadn't had the dots and so he'd have to feed the dogs and you get mad. Because it's like you're here, why can't you feed the dogs, and so one time, I took pity and I tried to feed the dogs and I did feed the dogs. But the kitchen was very slippery, and so I spilled water all over because we're mixing water with wet food with dry food to soften it as water, all over the kitchen. Because that's what me and the same dude that's our relationship, which is. It splatters everywhere and that's just way too, so I fell and I hurt my knee That was the first time I hurt my knee and. So I was, I was less. less helpful feeding the dog after that."
705.0,Provider,"It goes back to you know you got to take care of yourself first before you can take care of others and that's including animals, and you know yeah how how is, are you getting settled in."
7838.0,Patient,"Absolutely absolutely it's still because of the rest i'm not working, that hard right now but i'm i've lost my calendar, so I had to call and get your. Meeting ID number. And so I had to call yesterday for for mary's. ID number and."
705.0,Provider,Okay yeah wow yeah with um I know to see did you find your calendar.
7838.0,Patient,"I have not found it, yet I it's here, somewhere, you know I probably put it somewhere I just put it somewhere different, and you know it's like shifting everything is the go to it's like."
705.0,Provider,"And when you think it's it's funny when you have a system, and then you go outside that system and but it's somewhere different."
7838.0,Patient,"Why did I know banks yeah yeah it was always right, where I could see it at all times and it probably just shifted by itself. Or maybe i'll put it somewhere different I don't know but yeah I have to find it but i'm good you know I should be using my calendar on my phone anyway. Because that makes sense, I have to, I have to book reservations for Disneyland, and so I have to know my you know, obviously I know tuesday's taken but it's like I have you every other Wednesday and then I have the pain management group every Thursday and yeah and the other weeks so. You have to put it all on the phone."
705.0,Provider,Is that working out for you to Carol how your staggering the groups and then we're working to twice a week is the care intensity for you at a good level.
7838.0,Patient,"A very good level yeah except when I was off that one off that tries it down oh my God, I did the survey, I did the A survey, you asked us to do, and I was not prepared it was like where you sexually abused, when you were a child it's like. South question I want to answer right now and then there was another one was triggering that. Oh, what was one of your parents mentally ill or both your parents and so. i'd say yes to those to and I don't really consider. The the girl the preteen girl that. taught me how to masturbate and you know touch me I I felt like was more sexual exploration I don't think she did it out of malice or. You know um, but of course it was under my window and my mother recognized strange noises, and so I was in big trouble and my mother always told me never let a boy show you his penis So the first time that somebody offered that I said no, thank you, Rambo. it's like, no, no, I prepare for this moment my whole lot no."
705.0,Provider,that's fine when you're younger to and you're exploring you know you don't know until you remember that your mom told you that about men and you're like but wait a minute how's this other and how am I discovering what I feel comfortable with and.
7838.0,Patient,"And my and my mother was mentally ill, she wasn't while my father was alive. But after he dies she threw herself into religion and she. She would literally i'll give you an example, one of my favorite out, we were universals to you tours and one of my favorite actors ended up being the guest star at the end, this is the get started today at universal is that it, and so we got off the train them and my mother had a breakdown. She says. What are we doing, are we can't wait. I don't remember what she said and i'm like. A. he's the hazards man in the world. Not are willing successful not overly famous but they have this man in the world he's not going to fall in love with me. You know i'm a fan he's here to meet fans let's just go. You know. I can't believe she had a breakdown it's like really. honestly."
705.0,Provider,yeah and bringing it back as a kid you're like wait a minute let's bring this back.
7838.0,Patient,"Well, I had to I you know it's like it's funny because two women living together, we fought for power, and this is starting to the age of 10 because she wanted to move me where my favorite APP which was in. devor which is on the you know off the freeway going to Vegas system war and there's nothing there as a mom and pop shop everybody is senior citizen. They all have you know it's country living everybody has a few acres man had horse our dog. And I said I don't live anywhere without a shopping mall I don't live anywhere it was at a movie theater this isn't happening i'm a big city girl you blew me in the big city and i'm going to die in the big city, so no. um and my not that not my favorite APP but the other family member, the one sister younger sister always wanted to control our lives when we were anywhere near her. And it's just she was jealous of my mom because my mom was really beautiful but she was beautiful in her own way, you know she has red hair, which apparently she hated. And you know she was very pretty there's no reason to you know reach out, but they were both told their whole lives that their mother didn't want that. that she had had the for children, and that was enough, and they were unexpected and unwanted so you know that really plays with your mind."
705.0,Provider,"Oh yeah definitely your self esteem, especially at that young of an age."
7838.0,Patient,"Now yeah so. yeah so a little bit of that. So I keep looking at the window it's hard not to look at an open window and mobile home because there's so much activity, people are walking by people are driving by people are pulling out of the driveway people are doing 500 degree turns. Like you're in the neighborhood watch. i'm I am one of the neighborhood watch and is there is apparently an older man who's drunk all the time. That his wife won't let him in House if he's drunk and he's drunk all the time, so he's wandering around paying and Bush is the most recent when Catherine saw him, he was near the playground so it's upsetting that he was so close to children, but we don't think it was necessarily. pedophile behavior it was just he had to pee and he was not aware, and you know just kind of peak but Catherine let the management company know and so they're on the lookout for him that he is he's not doing yeah so."
705.0,Provider,"X exactly. yeah wow well i'm sure to for you it's it's now that most of your stuff well I guess all your stuff is in, and now it's just going through the things when you can. yeah yeah and I know to our next appointment is on the 27th at two o'clock. Yes, Okay, do you want me to send that in an email."
7838.0,Patient,I guess what you want to.
705.0,Provider,"get your let's see I see your email here, so let me go ahead and send that why we're. Talking and then do you, is it best Carol for you to find first your calendar before we set up more."
7838.0,Patient,"Well, I have this I can write it down in this book and then I can transfer it as soon as we're done. So let's set up more."
705.0,Provider,"Okay, so right now, when I look at your next appointment of you, for you and I, it is at the 27th at 2pm. OK OK so i'm going to send. let's see for individual session and then i'll go ahead and I just put that in the headline and then i'll just put that. In here, where I make sure that I send it."
7838.0,Patient,"And the media ids so once I have it, then I don't have to look it up or anything again because it's there because the pain management group change their. Their meeting ID and so. The doctor checks with Kevin Cavan, so I figured you'd be the one that wasn't the old idea it's like yes. i'm."
705.0,Provider,"Shooting you then another email with the meeting ID. So you'll have to mel's two emails in there. Only thing i'm the meeting ID has stayed the same just unfortunately one day. for whatever reason it needed a password and so. If that ever happens just go back to the virtual Center they'll reach out to me and then. we'll have to see they had to create a password that I could do that day um so if we go into November, then. Okay let's see we have already booked through October, because we have that 27th."
7838.0,Patient,mm hmm.
705.0,Provider,Good to them with be November 10 of November 24 if you wanted to stick with that every other week.
7838.0,Patient,"Absolutely, unless you want to go every week."
705.0,Provider,"that's going to be up to you what we did Carol is, if you feel like you need more support. Then we change the care intensity. To every week and that's definitely something that we do. I go and you probably heard Mary say this to your treatment plan is your treatment plan we're here to assist and support you."
7838.0,Patient,i'm. i'm wondering if we should go every week for a little while just I feel like. i'm in a weird place with Victoria being back and just being you know mistreated. You know it's like she doesn't even know she's doing it because she's such a narcissist that maybe we should go every week for maybe a month or something and then we can dial it back.
705.0,Provider,"Right and so communicate with me when you want to dial it back and then i'll go ahead, right now."
7838.0,Patient,and
705.0,Provider,"Put in the the weekly. let's schedule the weekly just be mindful, to the with that is then with the care intensity, you know how it is where to stay in the perimeters of the care intensity then. is to meet every week, however, if you get sick or something you always do this anyway Carol you call promptly you cancel."
7838.0,Patient,"Sometimes I forget to check in before because i'm so used to group, where you don't have to go to the virtual clinic."
705.0,Provider,Do you do you check into via text.
7838.0,Patient,"I have the text number I didn't have the text number now with this phone I barely have any phone numbers oh my i'm hoping if she gives me the password I can just. upload my cloud and then i'll have everything but I don't know if that's going to happen, because you know she's giving me her mother's password might be an invasion of privacy or you know. Like whatever."
705.0,Provider,"Cry you can. You know, if you like, you can try that to check, in that way, too, is sometimes helpful."
7838.0,Patient,mm hmm okay.
705.0,Provider,So what i'm going to do is i'm going to raise the care intensity. So let's see.
7838.0,Patient,"She was you know it's like she says oh i'll see you i'll take you to the post office Oh, maybe I won't take you to your post office, maybe i'll take you over. By where we are in long beach, and you know and it's like so I just got up early and I went to the post office and it was Columbus day. So I went to ups and I paid the extra out of my own pocket to send it ups, because I was already running late with it, with it, and I was so excited I was going to get all this money well somehow the money. was practically. Enough by. My bank normally just not pay things. That you don't have money for, but this time they pay $29 that was not in the bank. And I don't, the only thing is $29 could be the closet assistant, because I was looking at that you know, having one site that I can post on multiple formats. which you know make more money because they'd have more exposure but i'm so on emailing back and forth with somebody tasty if that's where the $29 away."
705.0,Provider,"I am looking to I just pulled up your calendar and i'm looking then, if you wanted to go every week. i'm looking then for next week to see what's available. It looks like on. October 20. There would be it looks like that one so only a 30 minute slot. Okay. We see on. and Wednesdays works best stirred are the can you meet on other days to are you like."
7838.0,Patient,I can meet on any day is it Tuesday or Thursday.
705.0,Provider,"Okay. Whether they after noon be two lights and because i'm looking at there's there's a couple of choices Carol. We can meet a 30 that would be, we can meet 1130 it would be for a 30 minute one or we can meet later in the afternoon, which would be there, an hour one at four o'clock."
7838.0,Patient,let's do the hour one at four o'clock.

705.0,Provider,"So you'll see a series of emails so. Just know the 27th is in the first one, and then it works backwards to all your other ones."
7838.0,Patient,Okay sounds good.
705.0,Provider,"yeah and I hope you find your calendar, because I know that that's always nice to keep you."
7838.0,Patient,yeah.
705.0,Provider,"You know, to keep you all set and. organized."
7838.0,Patient,"What might my roommate my lively group in friend gave me like a mormon temple calendar, so I might just write up on that because you know, then it's right next to the door. clear to see."
705.0,Provider,"yeah um I think something like that would be good, too."
7838.0,Patient,"yeah yeah i'm very I like. I like. i'm not organized i'm a slob but I like routine I find comfort in routine, for some reason, so like when I lived with cycle sisters his life actually how it works, they weren't really cycle. They were codependent with each other, but they weren't really psycho. We would clean every other Saturday, and it was me and the one sister the other sister never joined us, but you know it's like, if I have routine I can clean and I can do all these things and. But Catherine likes to do the dishes herself, because she plays loud music and you know, but I think i'm going to start running dishwasher because she's. doesn't run the dishwasher afterwards, and she pretty much planes look at them, but some of the dish which is more or less what I do i'm you know, try to. try to get all the junk off before I put it. But, and she knows how to load the dishwasher, which is so nice, because the kids didn't have any clue they were everywhere, everything was everywhere it's like the the dishes were stacked this way opposed to across slate."
705.0,Provider,"You said it best is living with adults is a little bit different and and better for you, it matches where you are."
7838.0,Patient,"yeah and. Catherine is just so caring and you know she brought me right, medicine and and stuck in a pharmacy and and don't my medicine, which is on her way home and from the first job she works two jobs, so I have hours of where i'm in loan in house and I can watch loud marvel movies."

7838.0,Patient,"yeah and I sold 47 items, which is a lot. And so yeah so i'm very happy, so I just I just want to escalate, so I can make more money more quickly, because a lot of the stuff is it feels like it's dead on posh because it's been there, so long. And I gave some of that stuff charity, because you know if i've had enough since last August and it hasn't sold. it's probably time to just let it go."
705.0,Provider,Island that's good cause to send it to charity and somebody will put it to good use.
7838.0,Patient,"Yes, we have a very for through goodwill by us that has a lot of designer stuff before I moved in here when I had the room, I was, I was buying stuff from there, but you know I need to get rid of what I have."

7838.0,Patient,"Exactly yeah we we literally I think I did three three bags with Brittany of clothes, because I just I. You know. I joke that I have more clothes than princess Diana because I just have a lot of clothes. i'm sure that is not accurate, but it feels accurate."
705.0,Provider,I was gonna say it probably feels that way.
7838.0,Patient,"Oh so yeah and then I discovered she wasn't going to give them to charity, she was just going to throw them in the trash, and so I took some of those bags back. And you know but we've mixed in the dirty clothes so, but you know I had this, I had the sister missionaries take a couple of the bags to. As a charity because it's like I don't want like nice expensive not that they're all expensive, some of them are very cheap. I just don't want my precious clothes going in a dumpster because that has happened before, and was my previous narcissist and. I I don't like I like to be able to pick and choose myself and not you know, have to. You know, let everybody. pick. You know where to go."
705.0,Provider,"yeah you know, I was hearing to someone else was saying that even if the clothes or let's say not like maybe you would want to donate on because the wear and tear but people are even sending stuff to Mexico, like the different scrap that's for them to make things. yeah I thought that was pretty interesting because you know what we tend to think isn't go throw away that other places, will put it together and make something out of it."
7838.0,Patient,wow that's cool. yeah that. That That would be good.
705.0,Provider,Exactly and then that way you keep you know you're still giving and it's to a good place.
7838.0,Patient,"Yes, but needs it. really needs it. And I slept with the cat for the first time yesterday. So that was that was interesting. yeah so it's like okay halfway through the night, she she wanted out but. yeah, but it was like okay yeah she likes hanging out with me because I pet her, and you know. I picked I love them both already i'm already invested kazuki so beautiful oh my God she's the most beautiful counted ever say she's part tabby and she's part, so I mean. it's just beautiful coloring it's like Oh, she just wants to be petted all the time I love it."
705.0,Provider,that's even an extra bonus of you settling in where you're living with more adults. And it matches up better and you get cats as a bonus.
7838.0,Patient,yeah what a chat window.
705.0,Provider,"yeah Okay, so why you're adjusting and I know that you're like okay so i'm adjusting now and then with the pain, have you found any type of relief for some of your pain that you've been having."
7838.0,Patient,"I asked the doctor give me strong pain pills, which I probably shouldn't have when I was. When I was you know, in the hari I cuz you know once everything was in there's only really room for me, so I was lifting things that were too heavy for me, and so I was in a lot of pain. In my back was just a lot of pain, I did you know I had to take some time off because I was just it was too much, but um. yeah so I have with. With the rest i'm wearing a brace which is helping I you know i'm not but it's got a bump on it, so I really have to go to the doctor, because I, you know it's maybe it's just swelling, but it seems strange that there's a bump next to the route, you know. Right and that's the sore spot is right there, and so I need to go in and I just hate going to my doctor because I hate my doctor I shouldn't say hey I I just like he has had dealings with the Narcissus. because she insisted on going with me. And you know she talked him into taking me off blood pressure, medicine, she told him things that I may or may not be allergic to. She you know control the narrative which is not ideal in someone's personal physician, and she always tells everyone were sisters were twins and it's like i'm an only child you're an only child, this is not true."
705.0,Provider,"and your primary physician to it's it's usually a good time to have one on one time, where you can really talk and be able to be open about what's going on with your physical health and medical needs."
7838.0,Patient,"he's a little tiny Asian man who are older older seniors to send older than I am, maybe by I want to say 20 years i'm not sure I don't know this ad but you know. And so you know if you look at my my illnesses on his chart it's like obese severely obese it's like to live it's like really could cover that with. And I there was a time when I was a hyper contract, so I think he's just expects whatever I come in with it's like I told him, yes, because my roommates. The kids were getting exposed to co bed like it felt like every other week it wasn't every other week, but it was a lot, and so they would go and they get tested and he wouldn't even test me he's like, no, no, you have the vaccine i'm not testing you. Okay. And you know didn't have symptoms, so it wasn't you know. yeah the changing seasons just killing me it's like I know. In the winds and it's like. Oh, my God."
705.0,Provider,I wreaking havoc on the allergy.
7838.0,Patient,"Yes, yes, oh, my goodness."
705.0,Provider,"Thank goodness for the dollar tree, and you can. Get the props for a buck."
7838.0,Patient,I love it.
705.0,Provider,"That way, they have the ones with even the lotion right."
7838.0,Patient,"yeah and I believe right so sometimes I have trouble making up my mind, like, I have a dress that's really long a maxi dress and you know we used to wear maxi dresses in seven days, so you know. But it's very floral and I, my first narcissist you know kind of she she was off she was overweight and hated herself. She you know, like, why do you wear all these flowers like because i'm a girl."
705.0,Provider,"And I like flowers, if you like, flowers again it's this late, I think, throughout this whole like experience and process girl that you're always like i'm going to express me. And this is. Carol style."
7838.0,Patient,yeah yeah so. yeah it's. yeah go ahead.
705.0,Provider,"Oh, I was just gonna say to how do you think right now Carol like if we talk about emotional health and physical and I know physical health we talked about, but how about more of the emotional health and mental health, where do you think you are today."
7838.0,Patient,"Well, I feel my emotional health just dealing with Victoria. More regularly is effective that. I I really don't want to spend time with her, but at the same time, you know she brings dogs by when she walks them at night, sometimes and so. You know I get to see oreo and rascal and so you know I think I plan to cut her out of my life completely at a later date when both dogs are gone. Because they're both older and so they're probably not going to live much longer and i'm sorry to say that, and it breaks my arrival my heart, will be broken when both of these own one or both of these dogs passes away but. and I think that'll. it'll just give me the choice. To completely break off the friendship and. But I feel bad because she doesn't you know she had a friend, she had a friend in Los Angeles, which. You know I don't know she's not she doesn't understand how to be a friend and she doesn't. seem very negative she you know she must be hype, you know harps on you know just look just so much why Disneyland isn't my happy place so once I snark back at her and said, do you have a hat place. Which wasn't very nice to me, but I just get so tired, sometimes of you know criticizing everything about me and. And you know but she'll end it with I love you and it just feels like everything's a manipulation as she's just using me to make yourself feel better because I am nice to her, and I am sympathetic and. And she you know she doesn't have simply friend one but her patience and you know, occasionally, I think, her daughter, but that's about it and she's going to get a wake up call because. Her daughter's boyfriend is not going to put up their shifts he's been in the military, you know he'll be he'll be nice as long as he can because he loves Brittany, with all his heart but living under the roof with Victoria is. You know she's going to try to manage him and and you can't manage. Somebody used to be in the military."
705.0,Provider,"You know, with all of that, and I know, sometimes Carl is that you think about others and how they're going to be. and bringing it back to you and being able to keep your you know being stable and keep your mental health, where you feel more balanced, are you able to do that and still have this relationship where it's it's. What i'm hearing is you're still allowing a petition to the dogs. And so um my question to you is is it is it healthy for you can you do both of these them right now."
7838.0,Patient,"I i'm not sure that's why I want to meet once a week because I may have to you know it's like I only live half a block away it's gonna be hard to completely cut ties, because she knows where I am and and. I don't know I just don't know I just feel. I I feel like i'm in a battle that I, you know it's like fight or flight and i'm not a fighter, but at the same time, I did something really empowering we went to church and she had. She hadn't told me if she was going to go to church or not, and my the sweet lady that drives me every week that I do go and I don't go as often as I should. But we have it on zoom so I can watch on zoom if I don't go and so she forgot, where I live, and so I I remembered her memory problems and I thought she's going to go to church and. And so, thankfully Victoria was out there about ready to go to church and so she said, you know carol's there so she walked around the corner and showed her, I was and so. And so I I rode with ALA because that's who I ride with inventory is not reliable she never she never commit to anything. Except going to swap me that she loves. And so, so I went with ALA inventory is like I think she called me earlier and said you do on a ride, and I said no, I Ales coming you know. And I, and I said, are you going to go at like are you going to leave at like 1115 because that's when the speaker be out. Because majority is always late for everything so because a little strange driving me she got in her car she was completely ready, she was dressed. got in her car and she literally pulled up next to us when we parked because she's so competitive, and so I, so I always sit with whoever drives me I think it's polite. I love a lot, I want to. Be with a. And so we said in the Ole section. And I love the old ladies, the old ladies are my favorite people, and you know, so we say that it's like the big island it's like you know churches got the fret section and it's got the back section and the big island where phil ladies like to sit and. So Victoria like this, where we're sitting like he'll drop me I saw it down."
705.0,Provider,"Now that's a good boundary and I like. yeah for all that you, you are like this is what I feel comfortable in this is what i'm going to verbalize and so good for you i'm happy to hear that it's like yeah when it needs to be a boundary you're setting your boundaries."
7838.0,Patient,I am I am sitting by boundaries.
705.0,Provider,so good.
7838.0,Patient,"yeah and so when she she called when she called. Monday like way after the you know after I needed to mail, the package and I had gotten up early and you know mailed it like 930 in the morning, then ups at 930 in the morning and. she's like Oh, you know, the post office I said no, I just got up and did it morning I just felt, you know because I never know with her and the other thing that happened at Church was she she contradicted me like show is to and we're in this huge I unless it but she's she has a. Add or whatever, whatever the attention deficit thing is, and so she always plays on her phone at church, because she can't just sit there and listen or feel anything and so. So I said, look at all this like room, have you know she's like five she's 511 you know just like no it's. it's like how he denies boy leg room it's like you're just so crazy."
705.0,Provider,"I know Carol that this has been an adjustment and that you're doing really well and I would encourage you, because I know we're going to meet each week. yeah is to. You know, with the boundaries, maybe tweak evaluate if you feel like there's it needs to be a boundary or, if you want to spend this time where we can talk about that more. yeah where you are, and is there any other goal before we end today that you want to have before we meet again on the 20th."
7838.0,Patient,"I think I need to look at the boundaries and set the boundaries, and you know she doesn't. She doesn't believe i'm ever sex she always thinks i'm a hypochondriac and you know which I was at one time, so I understand it's a holdover from that time but i'm. Just kind of look at you know because I like to nap sometimes I haven't not because it's so bright with the window I don't know half as often. And it's you know it's been hot, but now, this can cooler you know, maybe it maybe it could do it because I like to sleep when i'm tired and whether that's at night or during the day, and so I think I just have to look at. What Emily to do and I had her brand new home mom we were out on Monday, because we could watch around all walmart's and then we're going to go and lows and I know she's gonna walk me around all lows and it wasn't so much that I was setting a boundary is somehow it hurt my foot. No, no, it was the at amp T store and but I was sitting, but you know just because i'm sitting Valerie does it mean I don't have my feet and we're. Like. I don't know this, you know necessarily how i'm sitting, because I was very involved in this conversation that she's you know, trying to get that phone disconnected. You know, telling them every five seconds that you know because it's a business account i'm on her business account and a mother was on our business account. That you know her mother died and that she was this treatment over the phone and you know so i'm trying to hear this conversation just because I feel like it's my job. To listen to this conversation and the guard had the football game so loud I said, can you please just turn it down because they were literally on a. On a conference call you know with the speaker on and so yeah so just yeah."
705.0,Provider,"So maybe this weekend until we meet again, which is going to be on the October the 20th it is. 4pm is evaluation of just evaluating how are you eating boundaries. Yes, okay sounds like a good plan, and I will then see you in group on Tuesday. Yes, oh. Well, good good good, I look forward to then hearing on the 20th about your evaluation of boundaries."
