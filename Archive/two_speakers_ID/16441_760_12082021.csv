760.0,Provider,"Well, you want a dog that's some may be mild exercise."
16441.0,Patient,"Food and. Eating habits, I tend to sleep skip meals, because I generally forget. Okay yeah and it's not until like 5pm where I have like before noon."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, and you forget so what's what's happening that you that you forget, are you are you engrossed in school like keep doing your work. Studying school soon. Okay, and you just forget to eat. Okay. Have you ever thought about putting an alarm in your phone to give yourself at least like a maybe a late breakfast or. Something like that. yeah because I, I know, would we don't take proper care of you know, eating and sleeping sometimes that can also not only impact our physical health but say can impact our the way we feel too and. Our mental health as well, so that would be one suggestion of you know a thing to add to your routine would be to eat something in the morning, especially if you're running out the door you go you go to in person classes, or is it all online."
16441.0,Patient,Mostly in person classes.
760.0,Provider,"Nothing Okay, so that means you have to run to get there. yeah okay Okay, so you say you have a therapist already. And and that's somebody outside of a right heart health. it's okay all right, and so your goal with being here with us what, what can you talk to me about that. Which what's your goal with bright heart health."
16441.0,Patient,"I believe it was for like settling my medication, since I was. A child provider now basically adults."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so you just crossed that line over into adulthood, and so now you're looking for an a doctor at that for that stage, I see Okay, so are you still seeing that old therapist. Yes, okay. All right, but they don't prescribe medications. Okay. alright. So, as far as the some of the things that you want to work on with me. What do you see yourself working on, do you want to work on the anxiety, the depression. I think I read that you had reported that you have that you experienced fatigue often can you talk to me about that a little bit."
16441.0,Patient,i'm sorry let's see Liam.
760.0,Provider,"fatigue that's what I wrote. Excessive the tea that's when you like run down tired. sleepy is that something you struggle with as well. Yes, okay that could be as a result of not eating properly. Would you be willing to work on the eating just just to try to see if that works out the the sleepiness. yeah so you would have more energy to. So, what are you willing to do about that."
16441.0,Patient,Probably actually like trick with reminders from the foolish to listen to you.
760.0,Provider,"And maybe perhaps going to the grocery store and get it, you get some things that are quick to don't require that are not junkie not junk food and healthy food, but. Something that would be quick and easy that you could just even take with you so that you eat something and have a little bit of energy to. go about the day that's unreasonable. Okay, all right right. Okay, so. You want to work at can you talk to me about how you cope with your anxiety what what things you do to manage those symptoms."
16441.0,Patient,"I think it's I don't know if it's recommended to do this, but like ice I usually smoke. Too okay good or."
760.0,Provider,"marijuana. Yes, Okay, so that that's the block that's the thing if you don't know what to do to manage the anxiety, other than smoke so that's the thing that's holding you back. Is that fair to say. yeah okay. Okay. um. What would you like to learn some new coping skills. For. for that. The other problem with marijuana I don't know if you've noticed this can you tell me at what age you started using marijuana."
16441.0,Patient,room. I didn't start heavily into two years ago.
760.0,Provider,"Two years ago, and how do you use is it small because it edible what is, what is this. Okay. So just just so you know when when people have. us at you know daily in the habit there's what we call a tolerance that builds you know, usually the first you know the most high a person has been a get is that first time they use that substance and then, as you continue to use that on a daily basis, your your tolerance for. marijuana is going to increase, meaning that you need more marijuana to get the same effects have you noticed that in yourself. Yes, and and where that can go from there right is that. People if they use it long enough can get to the point where they don't even get high anymore, they just they just have to use it to feel like quote unquote normal. So the the other situation. You know that. You know people cope in the best way they can I think when when they're having. Problems with anxiety depression or prom or whatever Whatever the case may be, I know we we try to cook the best we can, but when we use a substance to call. The feelings what what happens is the you know the frontal cortex of your brain gets affected it goes dark and. It basically shuts down your emotions, so you can't feel what you're the anxiety or depression that but that doesn't mean it's gone away. And then I think, as we over time, as we rely on that it just kind of builds the anxiety and depression, instead of. And you never really addressing it you're just shutting it off you just shutting it off when you're under the influence and then it turns itself back on as you as you come out of it does that make some kind of sense to you. Yes, Okay, so do you have you heard of any other more positive coping skills as your other therapist helped you with other coping skills. 70 when working with with that person."
16441.0,Patient,So yeah they recommend me to instead go out with friends or. Two teams through. During the time I quantities.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, and and have you tried that."
16441.0,Patient,"Yes, a target."
760.0,Provider,And does it work.
16441.0,Patient,Through it dude.
760.0,Provider,"Okay. Do you think you're the type of person that kind of bottles up your emotions you don't really you kind of keep that inside you don't it's uncomfortable or feels weird or you. To to let those things out. Okay. All right, so maybe when you talk to a friend it's kind of hard to talk to them. Okay, do you know what it is you're feeling right now. Okay, all right okay well i'm. exercises another good coping skill for anxiety. mindfulness is yet another coping skill for anxiety grounding exercises I don't know if you've heard, I know you've heard of exercise, obviously, but I don't know if you've heard of grounding or mindfulness."
16441.0,Patient,proof.
760.0,Provider,Have you ever tried to practice.
16441.0,Patient,"Through a bit, but did I don't feel like i'm good at that so."
760.0,Provider,"Okay okay well it's it's a practice, you mentioned that you played the piano did you ever take lessons when you play the piano. In your pocket Okay, did you start out playing really, really well when you started playing the piano or did you have to did you have to learn and practice."
16441.0,Patient,practice.
760.0,Provider,"Okay well mindfulness is a lot like that it's it becomes kind of a new concept and maybe you know, a human being, our brain is kind of. set in its ways and the way that we think, maybe some of the things we believe. And so mindfulness is kind of getting you out of that thinking. it's more about being in the present moment. And you know, using present present moment awareness to deal with the symptoms of anxiety, so I have another question for you write. Your anxiety is it, are you thinking about something that you're afraid, is going to happen, or is it, it is it just random formless anxiety, how would you describe what."
16441.0,Patient,I would say that I get like most like oh my anxiety when i'm outside like my house like. interacting with other people. Concerned like afraid of like how they view me as a person.
760.0,Provider,How to.
16441.0,Patient,Be how they. how they view me.
760.0,Provider,"Oh, how they view okay. Okay, all right. And what are you afraid of what what's The worst thing that said, what is the most terrible thing that they would think about you that causes that anxiety or fear."
16441.0,Patient,See fear of judgment okay.
760.0,Provider,"Did you have a lot of judgment in your life. from home. Take take deep breaths it's Okay, and I know it feels strange to express your emotion right now with me but it's okay. Is there some part of you that you think. you're going to get judged by dad or somebody else. Was gonna judge you."
16441.0,Patient,And just people don't know me here soon.
760.0,Provider,"Okay. I do do which one which one of these statements do you think is true for you right. i'm not quite sure who I am. But i'm afraid of judgment. Or, I know, who I am but i'm afraid of letting it out, because i'm afraid of judgment. Or is it some some other version. If it's not one of those."
16441.0,Patient,The first version.
760.0,Provider,"not sure of who you are. Okay, so. Can you tell me. You know what some can you name at least one of the things that you're good at, maybe strengths, that you have. I think I think what i'd like to do. Would you like to we could do some activities where we're kind of discovering who you are maybe some of the things we can start with strengths. And, and I know I know this is obviously very difficult for you, but at 18. Any 18 year old regardless of what's happened to them, or what pains they carry or mental health issues they have we all kind of struggle at 18 with identity and who am I kind of thoughts, where do I want to go. and for me personally, I remember being 18 I would be maybe a little bit fearful about being successful as an adult and being successful in school. Does that ring true to."
16441.0,Patient,You.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, those fears are normal right. And you know. Life is kind of like a process to then we talked about that, like. You know you don't. You don't. You kind of a kind of a bolt. And, and I think when when people carry you know difficulty if they feel judged, especially by somebody who has been around and supports them it's kind of hard to deal that way to deal with that and so perhaps there's a certain fear that i'm not going to live up. Or that i'm it's not going to be enough and and I think that's not your fault. Does that make sense. Okay. Have you ever tried to talk to your father about this, this is the ice still judgmental to this day, now that you're 18."
16441.0,Patient,"He have a sojourner truth for bit. Surely changes parents, too, but I would say it's also difficult for some change how big."
760.0,Provider,"yeah does does it come out of the blue, because it happened, like artists that happen because maybe he did something you didn't like or proper role or something like that. Okay, so sometimes it just comes. out of the blue. And i'm guessing when it comes from, out of the blue, it kind of feels confusing and maybe. there's a level of you that maybe doesn't emotionally feel safe. Because you don't know when and if it's going to happen is that is that fair to say. So maybe that's part of what's causing this anxiety. Has this been throughout your childhood."
16441.0,Patient,Oh yes.
760.0,Provider,Can you give me an example. Of what your father does that's judgmental. And you can breathe and take your time if you need to.
16441.0,Patient,Be judges judges me or my siblings baseline of our decisions point what we do either it's like the school or.
760.0,Provider,Your performance and school. Or the classes you choose to take. All of that. Okay anything else that he is that he feels judgmental.
16441.0,Patient,"In. His judgment, or he used to be more judgment on what how I like started dressing differently."
760.0,Provider,How is that How has it changed.
16441.0,Patient,or now he hurriedly like points out like judges my periods and sort of how it.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, and what does he say."
16441.0,Patient,What did he used to or but it.
760.0,Provider,One of each maybe.
16441.0,Patient,"He used to be like, why do you like, where that you like it doesn't suit your like. Like you're not like, just like that, except for and. Now he. He just says one mo is wearing this book."
760.0,Provider,"And that makes you feel. that's the feeling you feel when he says, those kinds of things."
16441.0,Patient,i'm just. confused. As to. Why. Sorry.
760.0,Provider,"Thank you take your time. Take your time. Okay, let it out. Okay, you don't have to hold it together for me. Take your time. And when you're ready, you can speak."
16441.0,Patient,This question sorry.
760.0,Provider,What does it make you feel when your father says these things.
16441.0,Patient,It makes me. It makes me feel confused and hurt. Because like. i'm not sure why i've been done.
760.0,Provider,"there's a part of you that doesn't feel accepted by your father right. When was the last time you let yourself have a good cry. Remember earlier when we started having a conversation what happens when we hold our emotions in, especially when they're so powerful like this. You see this seem to be struggling to hold it in. The you feel you need to hold it together because because of your dad or is it more now because of YouTube. Because does it feel strange to cry. Does it feel what what is, what do you think about yourself when your prize there. some kind of a thought about it."
16441.0,Patient,She week.
760.0,Provider,"I said something that was told to you when you were young people who cry our weekend oversensitive. What if I were to tell you what would you think if I were to tell you, the opposite is true. Is it easy to cry."
16441.0,Patient,depends for.
760.0,Provider,"depends in some situations, I guess, it can be. I think. Seeing one difficult emotions. and choosing a safe place to express them in a safe way is really and truly a strength. What would you think if I told you that."
16441.0,Patient,it'd be different crispr.
760.0,Provider,"I it's my belief that tears are god's way of kind of washing away the negative emotions. kind of like the rain washes away the dirt when when it rains. Set make some sense to you. Okay. i'm sorry to make you go through all this, but I. appreciate that you're that you're telling me this. take a deep breath. it's really important to express one's emotions to overcome symptoms of anxiety and depression. Because it has to it has to has to come out and then, once it's out it's like cleared and then. Then you can start to do some of the work that caused the emotions, the the things that happened to you or the things that were said to you that caused the emotions and then you can start to work on your self esteem and learn other ways to cope. Without using marijuana because the other thing with marijuana you know what can happen addiction builds over time. And I know you don't want that. make sense yeah Okay, do you feel I can you tell me your emotions now do you feel slightly better with those same how you think you feel now."
16441.0,Patient,say I really. think so.
760.0,Provider,"Even holding it on too much. Once that's cleared away then your brain like things a little bit more, we can we can do some self discovery stuff. What happens, we develop we develop. What i'll call. Thought habits, we you know habits of thoughts or maybe things that we believe things like it's weakness to cry that's a belief, I would call that an irrational belief. But we operate in our life with these thought habits and when they're negative they causes a negative emotion. And the same thing with the belief, and then it causes choices in our behavior. Okay, so when we start to the process of recovering from that and improving our mental health it's a point of questioning those those thought habits questioning the things you believe and kind of a process, the process of self discovery. And it's really a lifelong process because I don't I don't you could live to be over 100 and we should still be learning, even if we're 100 years old, we should still be discovering. But, especially when we're young because you know, the more time you have here the more things you have to experience for that's just part of your development. So it's okay to be where you're at. Okay. So would it be fair to say that you suffered a little bit or some amount of emotional abuse in childhood."
16441.0,Patient,So.
760.0,Provider,"It was only from that nobody else. So. Do you have a safe place to go. To process emotions, do you have like your own room or someplace that you can go for that that nobody's going to disturb you. Okay, and people respect your space. Some barging in or even like yeah. What would you think about starting to process feelings, maybe writing in a journal, would you be willing to do that. Okay. Okay, so how good at you how good, are you at identifying motion there or is that something you struggle with."
16441.0,Patient,Lucy this show is 21.
760.0,Provider,"All right, alright, I think I think it's common when people fall into the habit of repressing or holding in their emotion, one of the ways they do that is by denying their feelings or trying to like kind of turn them off and deny them. And then they might even come to the point where they're unconscious with the feelings. I have. This hold it up to my camera here. This is what i'm going to call an emotion wheel. And you see the Center of the emotion wheel, I know you probably can't read it. But it has the basic emotions happy surprised. Bad fearful angry disgusted sad and they all have their own like individual color and, as you go out safe from fearful. You come out you see that those are different forms of fear. And so, would you be willing, I could send you this, or you could just Google it because it's all over you just Google emotion wheel, and you will get this or similar image that's where I got this one I just printed it. Would you be willing to start journaling trying to identify it doesn't have to be all bad feelings, you can have some good feelings to like me, you know because I did say the word happy and then there's some parts of surprised that is also a pleasant emotion. Like in quoted in surprised or things like amazed and excited eager energetic. Those are positive emotions, so you don't have to when you do in emotions journal you don't have to just journal about your negative stuff you can journal about what it whatever the emotion is. Would that be something that you think he would be willing to do, or just talk to me about that."
16441.0,Patient,"He some doing mood to do. Okay, so."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so let's let's start with that. i'd like you to do that. Before our next session like try to do it, you don't have to write a book. Right, you know just try to write at least like a half a page or I don't know if you want to do it electronically probably you do that, however, you want to do it, it doesn't matter. Just make sure that your journal is safe it shouldn't be for anybody's eyes, but your own, because this is a safe, this should be a safe place to process feelings and it's nobody's business. You know, even if you're angry it's nobody's business but yours, unless you want to share that that makes sense, so you have a safe way to lock up that journal, so that nobody reads it. Here okay you're going to do it electronically or on paper. Okay, all right, well then it will be locked with password probably yeah okay all right so start with just like a paragraph or two, if you want to. Try to search your mind, maybe, maybe this is something you could do, towards the end of the day. And kind of think back to the day. and think about things that happened and what were the things you were feeling now if you're feeling anxious, you could you know go into the fearful section and read those words. In the fearful Category I see scared anxious insecure weak rejected threatened nervous. And it goes up from there helpless. So start journaling on that. Okay. Okay, so what is your, what is your email right."
16441.0,Patient,"The one that I used for the virtual clinic or differently, no would be fine."
760.0,Provider,Whatever one you want to give me.
16441.0,Patient,Our wife and then cardenas. 44 at gmail.com.
760.0,Provider,"gonna be really important to start journaling what you're feeling. Okay, and start to get in touch with those emotions and. The number one thing on that is. There needs to be a level of safety, you know I use the word safety and people always assume that means physical safety, but we can be emotionally safe or unsafe. mentally safe or unsafe, so you know you you're going to want to protect yourself and make sure you want to let your emotions out in a way, in an environment where you're not going to be attacked or criticized or judged that makes sense. Yes, okay so. Maybe closing lock the door, or you know. I used to do that kind of thing like early in the morning before people got up. or or late at night, and then you pick the time that works best for you. Okay.
