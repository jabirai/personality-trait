Domestic violence cases like depending on how serious it is sometimes they get dismissed. yeah that's all he told him. i'm not sure, in my case. cuz it was domestic violence, with a. deadly weapon assault. I don't know."

I spoke to my dad maybe twice after that, but that was because he had an appointment like he had medical appointment and no I, I just wanted to follow up with him and see like how. It all went and that's it yeah nothing much."

226.0,Provider,The holidays.
15269.0,Patient,um.
226.0,Provider,"OK, so the fact that you guys don't celebrate doesn't create any extra stress does it or."

226.0,Provider,"Okay, so everybody. So people are okay families okay with you guys now."
15269.0,Patient,"Oh. Oh, you mean that um well. I wouldn't say they're Okay, with it, because yeah that's that's been. A challenging."
226.0,Provider,Okay wow.
15269.0,Patient,Throughout the years now yeah.
226.0,Provider,"Okay. How are you feeling I mean overall like like mentally and emotionally, how do you feel."
15269.0,Patient,"Well, I. i've noticed that my hair is falling, a lot lately so. I mean it already explains. How."
226.0,Provider,yeah.
15269.0,Patient,"My feelings are. I don't know it's just. It could have been different, you know. But. I mean all of us had our part. In this. situation that we're in at the moment, like some of us more some other lists. But I feel like. My parents. As parents. could have. could have easily. Like. Past by few things."
226.0,Provider,"yeah. Well, how does your husband like how is he, like What are his feelings like where is he with everything like."
15269.0,Patient,"he's been really supporting me like he really feels. My feeling like he mentioned a lot like I know what you're going through, I really understand like this is not easy for you. And he gets upset to know who would want. To be in tension. With. With your wife's family, you know."
226.0,Provider,"yeah it's so much isn't it it's it's. it's a lot. So I mean, how do you guys like, how do you get how are you guys getting through that like tell me what you're doing like how are you finding. trying to find some peace, but this."
15269.0,Patient,"Sometimes we pray together. um. Sometimes I mean not sometimes. Well yeah I don't open up a lot so, but he he feels like there, there is a lot going through, I mean you see like so he he will come to me and you'll be like you want to talk like I know. you're inside your head is just a mess, so you wanna talk, talk about it, like we will talk. I will tell him like well how I feel like. And he he's really understanding, but there is. I wouldn't say there is much we can do. I mean, I would just be waiting. To see if there will be any change. From my family side, especially my mom yeah. it's I really can't understand. How would. A mother like. Just. I mean i'm sure she she doesn't feel. Well, either. From what what I. Know like. How I know her. i'm sure she is going through. Some emotion to. know but. That should have. made her to take some steps you know. yeah but I don't see any any steps from her. I mean my dad I understand like. he's an introvert. He doesn't really. And plus he's going through. Depression and so so i'm not expecting a lot from him. But my mom could. Could fix a lot of thing."
226.0,Provider,"You think. Do you think that she has any idea that she could really be the catalyst to change that dynamic, do you think she has. An understanding of what she would what would be helpful to do."
15269.0,Patient,"I feel like she she thinks. She has done. All she could. On her and. I don't know I really don't know what like what goes through their head like. And that's been the problem all these years, like even before me, getting to know my husband like. They never expressed like a holiday for you about anything. yeah he. If they don't like it if if they're pleased with that if they're happy if they're satisfied. Like. I don't know. me as their child note. I feel like I just grew up on my own. Especially when I became an adult. I feel like i've just been. You know, on my own. Like they didn't. i'm sure they cared. about what kind of person I will become like but. I don't know how to explain that it makes sense of. I feel like i've been emotionally. Neglect neglected. cuz. living under the same roof with them, they didn't really see like what I went through sometimes."
226.0,Provider,I mean.
15269.0,Patient,"Come on, I I was dismissed from college for one year. And they never. found out like. I mean yeah I didn't tell them. Maybe that's why they didn't find out. But as a parent. They saw me like. That i'm not okay like. I wasn't okay for a while. But I feel like for them. They saw that. Coming. From my like husband. Who, I was dating at the time. Like I feel like all the problem they see like it wasn't because of him. If I went through something that was because of him or if I was sad, it was all because of him, but they didn't really know like. what's lying under."
226.0,Provider,"So how can you never know. Like, how can you never."
15269.0,Patient,"Because I thought. That they're going to tell me like Oh, because you're dating this guy and you're failing and. I didn't want them to think that. that's why I just carried God Lord. i'm like okay it's just one year i'm gonna wait and then i'll be. A register again and i'll go back."
226.0,Provider,How can we were just did you why what happened.
15269.0,Patient,"I felt my English Class three times, and when you fail. When you fail the same Class three times you get this niche."
226.0,Provider,"Where were you going to school, but school."
15269.0,Patient,Community college.
226.0,Provider,But. But you can re enroll if you wanted to re enroll right.
15269.0,Patient,yeah after one year.
226.0,Provider,"yeah Okay, is that something you want to do, do you want to re enroll and."
15269.0,Patient,"Oh, that was like what like four years ago. yeah that was. That entire year was again I went through. Like emotional stress and all that again and that's when I started seeing a therapist too, but I didn't really continue like I I just maybe visited her three times. But then I. Thought i'm getting. You know. i'm progressing like i'm getting better so. and honestly I wasn't seeing any benefit from her so. Let me stop going to her, and I mean my. My current husband, who was dating back then he helped me a lot also some friends helped me get back on my feet so."
226.0,Provider,"Okay, so some of this has to do with like your I think there's a lot there's fear around telling your parents they're like how you really feel, and so there was there's been a. amiss understanding, maybe in this communication around. What or lack of understanding of what you were dealing with and so. So it makes sense to me that they would. Well, it doesn't make sense, but I know like they're blaming your husband. For. You feeling sad or. conflict or. Things that you weren't able to do or aren't doing right now for yourself as a craft or in the past, really more in the past."
15269.0,Patient,"I mean i'm. I feel like it's easier for them to blame. him. Then. To see. A lot of it had to do with them. It was a conflict. between me and them basically because, even before dating him like I got into an accident, I got into accident twice actually. And neither of those times I was. I felt comfortable like telling them well, the first time. I had to tell them because I wasn't really sure what to do, oh, and I mean it was a it was a. Common card that we were all driving so they would eventually find out. And then the second time, again I got into the accidents. I knew we was my fault, I mean it wasn't a huge accident, but again I had the fear of telling them because I thought Luke. Not, not because I thought, but because, from what I had seen. All my life was instead of. Like first thing you would ask, or like are you okay like nothing happened to you. But. No matter if I was in fault or not, they would have been only. what's the damage on the car like. Charles like you know what nobody got. Like moto the diamonds. yeah i'm just gonna fix the car on my own expense. And then i'll tell them later on. When. My dad found out so. I have to tell them."
226.0,Provider,And how did they react.
15269.0,Patient,I mean. They were upset obviously what. again. At the moment. I didn't. Get the. Caring feeling that I need it.
226.0,Provider,yeah right so.
15269.0,Patient,Do you feel like.
226.0,Provider,This has been a theme like for most of your life that they've never been able to show up for you personally.
15269.0,Patient,"yeah. I mean, I know. they've been crying really hard all their life to provide for us for me and my sister. Making sure we have a roof. yeah we have food we have clothing, we have all we need but. They never really. cared about our like emotional needs."
226.0,Provider,"Does your does your store feel the same way, I know you guys have kind of a tense relationship, but do you know that's how she feels too."
15269.0,Patient,"I don't know. I feel like. I feel like i'm. Things. How should I say it, like things got things changed really. fast. What we couldn't we didn't get a chance. To. Get close enough. To be sisters, you know. Like before coming here. We we both. I mean, I consider myself as a as as kid back then like we both were kid so. When your kids you go through a different. challenge with your siblings like. Your fight all the time, and you don't get along we had that and then, once we got here like. I was in adults and I had my own, you know. I was going through my own thing, and she was still like she's four and a half years younger than me so she was still in her teenage. years."
226.0,Provider,yeah.
15269.0,Patient,"So there, there was that gap in between us and we couldn't really catch. The point. to open up to each other and. yeah talk about our feelings and all that."
226.0,Provider,How old were you. When you came here again i'm sorry.
15269.0,Patient,I was 20.
226.0,Provider,"So how do you make peace with this like, how do you how do you how do you want this to Mike what's the best case scenario, like, how do you want this all to be. Anyone all this to work."
15269.0,Patient,"Well, I I really one. What I want is to have. A peaceful relationship with my parents sister. and That my husband has that my husband will have a peaceful relationship with them. But. The reality is that. it's not gonna happen until. They make changes, you know."
226.0,Provider,Do you are you close with your husband's family.
15269.0,Patient,yeah.
226.0,Provider,"So there's. Okay, so you guys there's no tension and you guys get along and it feels. It feels supportive."
15269.0,Patient,"yeah kind of I mean they don't know about this situation. um. We decided not to tell them because. I mean it's going to create. Like stress for them. I mean they they're already going through their own thing they're elderly so they're. battling with all. Problems and. We didn't want to give them more stress, but yeah I mean. No matter how much I refuse. And it's hard to admit. But they've been supporting both."
226.0,Provider,Like financially or just.
15269.0,Patient,"Know like. In general, like those those few times that we had huge fight they've been the ones. Who. who stepped in and."
226.0,Provider,You know right.
15269.0,Patient,"talk to him, like my husband. they've been actually supporting me more than him like. huh yeah."
226.0,Provider,to your parents and his parents get along.
15269.0,Patient,"that's another thing. um. it's. I feel like they. They don't have that sincere. relationship together, you know, ever since we got married we. I don't know why I get this vibe from my. mom that she didn't want to like associate with them. I don't really understand why. I mean i'm i'm trying to connected with all my dad has been through has been going through the depression, maybe that's why she didn't want them to associate a lot, so they don't see is. Like feelings and like see how he's doing. But like we tried a lot like what we would go, we would go to their my in laws house and like we would invite my parents also like. Like casually you know. And I mean my mother in law would try to like invite them to. Or, I would call them over to our house or but like. Recently Doug before all this happen. My mother in law was trying to like call them. Over to their house. My mom rejected like twice and then they saw each other in a store and. They talked and. My mom told her that, if we want to come, I will just call you or which is not something that my. That I was expecting from my mom you know so it's it's really. cold."
226.0,Provider,"yeah does your mom feel like my hair beneath her you know, is it kind of the status thing like Why is she so resistant to know them."
15269.0,Patient,Like What do you mean beneath her like.
226.0,Provider,Like you know more like she's higher status or she doesn't feel like they're worthy of her time like you know does she feel like they're beneath her in some way.
15269.0,Patient,"Like my in laws are beneath her I don't think so. I don't know in my head i'm just writing golden scenarios, so I was like Maybe she thinks. Maybe she blamed them. For. their sons like whoa he is maybe she thinks that they. Like raised him like that I don't know I just."
226.0,Provider,"So would it if you were to have a conversation with your mom about this like what do you think her reaction would be because I just feel like there's some the unsettling the create so much confusion, intention and barriers between you and."
15269.0,Patient,"I I remember once I mentioned it to her, it was again. It was that one time that we had this. Intense conversation over the phone. And that was when I was like. mom you are not like contacting this people like you're not talking to them like I know. You talk to. So many of our relatives during the day, like you, will just call my on or I mean I have lots of aunts and uncles and their wives and they she she will call them like randomly during the day and. she's really close with all of them. So I was like mom. I know if my. um it might not be easy for you to. Like. To accept. Maybe just maybe accept them as your like new family members, but. Oh, you need to call them at least like once a week or she's like oh like what do you think like do you think I have all this time, like I get tired of. The once I get home from work, I just want to rest, I was like okay. I didn't say anything."
226.0,Provider,"Okay, what about like do you want to try and reconnect with your sister do you feel like that's something that could happen right now."
15269.0,Patient,"i'm not right now, no cuz. I mean, as much as I would want to. um. it's not something. That wouldn't happen. Without her. Like apologizing. For what she's done she's or she said. Especially to my husband, you know. I know I might sound. harsh. But. I. I wasn't expecting her. to behave like that. Your sister uh huh. yeah."
226.0,Provider,yeah cuz she took your parents side.
15269.0,Patient,"I mean. There are things that I can understand. understand her doing good but. yeah obviously you would. Take your parents side, rather than taking your brother in US or your sister side. But. things got sour even way before that, like. Like out of nowhere suddenly she she just started acting up while I was still dating. And I I never figured out why. We. Even though we weren't that close we were still you know. sisters. and Both of me and my husband, we tried our best I mean obviously me as her sister and then him he really tried to be a brother for him. For her sorry. But. She she started this thing from us slowly and then. um. I guess she she chose. A new sister and a new brother in law for her. Who are my cousin and. He he's I mean her fiance."
226.0,Provider,yeah.
15269.0,Patient,yeah it's a mess.
226.0,Provider,"Well, it just goes back you know there's just a lot of things that have been left unsaid, you know, on your part two, and so. yeah so now it's a little bit it's just fractured you know it's there's a lot of there's a lot of division going on."
15269.0,Patient,"yeah I mean it got to a point where I couldn't. hold it hold my emotions anymore, and I was like. I burst out like. yeah before my wedding. i'm like. It was maybe a week or two weeks before my wedding we were like doing some. remodeling. and I found this time. alone with my sisters so. I don't remember how it how the conversation started but. I I tried to tell her. Like. What I feel what what I was going through like how I felt about her. about her behavior about her reaction towards me and. My. husband. and I tried to understand like why she acting like that. But she just kept. Like jumping from. Things two things you know. And I never got a clear answer from her."
226.0,Provider,"Well, how come, why do you think she wouldn't answer you."
15269.0,Patient,"I don't know. I was trying to see like what's lying under that. Tension on there that anger. But she didn't open up she didn't say anything she she kept saying like. My husband's name is Emmanuel and she's like oh like Emmanuel should have. acted like this, or. He shouldn't have acted like that. So again, it was all blamed on a manual. I tried to explain him her that well ever since we started dating. He tried to be like he saw you as a sister. So he did. All he would do for his own sister. But you just kept rejecting you. You didn't want to see that. Like, for example, back then, my sister had just got her driving permit. and Obviously, she wanted to drive all the time when like we were going out so. But she wasn't added on the insurance so. Emmanuel was worried like he was like he even mentioned her few times like Okay, I understand you're excited you just got your permit, but you need to be added on the insurance in order to you know, being able to drive war. whenever you want to drive. i'm not gonna let all mom to drive with you. So. He didn't want me to be like in the same car with her. While she was driving without insurance. and That was the start of that. Conflict I guess."
226.0,Provider,yeah it's really dangerous to drive without insurance we don't want to live with that and.
15269.0,Patient,yeah.
226.0,Provider,"So what he did, is he put up a set a boundary you know you set a really healthy boundary. You know and somehow she took that as an insult or criticism where it's really you know it's the law and it's protecting her on text you."
15269.0,Patient,"yeah we we had. A. We had arguments about that specific. matter a few times like like not a few times, every time we wanted to. Go out like together we had that problem."
226.0,Provider,"Okay So how do you stay connected with your husband and how do you guys continue to support each other, because I think right now, things are tense with your family, we know that. So it's kind of like moving forward it's really about being able to you know stay close with your husband. get the support and be able to support each."
15269.0,Patient,"yeah I mean. At this moment. i'm. At this moment. We just have each other. yeah I mean. again. These parents are really supporting to but. We tried to. How can I say like. We are. We are a separate family, like me and my husband are. have our own family. So we try to. keep things. within ourselves. And we try to just support each other. Even though my in laws are very supportive. Again there. There are. Some. problems that. I wouldn't want them to know. or like I don't feel comfortable talking. To them about that so and my husband really understands that. We basically just have each other at this moment."
226.0,Provider,"that's not a bad thing you know. yeah so and I mean you know, maybe that's just where things need to be right now, because you know when you came into this program you know, there was there were some there are some issues between the two yeah."
15269.0,Patient,"yeah and. Now, I can see. Where the source was from like the problem source. Even though it's really hard for me to accepted. But now I can see that. My husband wasn't there. Like. I mean, I understand. He has had. Some part. In this. journey, but the main thing wasn't him. I not now, I can see he's been. Like he's been trying to be. peaceful and supportive. But on the other hand. My mom. wasn't the peacemaker. She was the one creating. The drama. And that's why I feel like. Not that I feel like i'm sure like that that was. The main reason of arguments with my husband, because I didn't want to accept. That my mom is creating all this."
226.0,Provider,"Well, you know now you have a clearer picture you know and then that gives us an opportunity to to talk about how to move forward, you know, like how to. How to negotiate ahead and navigate. This is. it's not easy, you know it's it has it has its challenges but it's about like, how do you remain. How do you find peace, you know peace with this and how do you still remain connected to your husband, you know because really it's about your relationship with your husband, you always want to have a relationship with your family but really. You know what's what's front and Center what's. First, is your relationship with your."
15269.0,Patient,Right.
226.0,Provider,"and your marriage. So maybe that's just bring your focus needs to be right now, not saying that at some point during the you know, in the future that you won't be able to have. Both like a relationship with your family with, and you know we just you never know you just remain really open, but right now, your your focus is you and your husband. And maybe it's about just giving your mom some space like creating a little bit of space between you and your mom and your dad and your sister. You know what factors, but this kind of settle you know, like focus on the Court date focus on what you guys need to focus on as a couple as a married couple, and then you know. Work on your relationship with your parents. As you feel you can do that."
15269.0,Patient,yeah I mean. it's really hard for me not to be. in touch with them. yeah but. I I still try to call my dad.
226.0,Provider,Okay. And yeah.
15269.0,Patient,"You know, get updates on how he's doing on. yeah how everybody's doing."
226.0,Provider,"yeah absolutely. So it's doing it, the way, like still staying connected but doing it in a way that it's not going to create a lot of stress for you and it's not going to put stress on me and. that's really what was happening. yeah it was really creating a divide. Between not enough a divide it was creating a lot of tension and arguing with you and your husband that didn't really need to be there. And so I think what happened, it was just a lot of misdirected anger and tension and stress on your part and that's you know when you pulled the nine buttons that argument, so you need to. You know the The goal is to turn manually aware of that, you know okay it's not my husband it's my parents or you know just be really clear on what's happening so you don't put them to that situation again."
15269.0,Patient,"yeah. I even mentioned it to my mom that. Like. Your behavior is creating. A lot of local. arguments in my life with my husband like if would you want, would you really want like. Would apparent one to create a drama."
