214.0,Provider,hey what's up Jimmy how's it going.
7340.0,Patient,"On man is gone i'm tired, but it's going from a video."
214.0,Provider,What i'm so i'm assuming status quo still remains.
7340.0,Patient,yeah pretty much couple confusing well but a couple but confusing statement why don't have video going. Can you see me.
214.0,Provider,"No, sir."
7340.0,Patient,"Oh, there we go. cuz I didn't push the button. So yeah still status quo, you know. Working and sleeping gets things done. forget what it was oh that's what it was we've gotten slight argument and I just I was. We got a rental that we're getting rented rent so we were talking about that a little bit and she tried calling me when I was at work, so I called her back during lunch break and then she started ragging on me about drinking and driving. and raising her voice and everything, and I was in the drive thru I said hey i'm getting some food i'm getting some food and she said, fine and hung up. So you know it was what it was whatever but. Then she texts me later, she said that. She says you've already had sex with someone haven't you. And I said no, but i'm like, why are you asking me like that, like you really care. You know. So a little confusing, but you know all of her. statements and everything up to this point still hold on to that so. That what goes through your head half the time. So, but other than that yeah status quo."
214.0,Provider,So just just being realistic. What is the end game.
7340.0,Patient,"I you know i'm not sure i'm i'm branching out. You know i've just been working and going to shoot some pool and. there's gallop in sacramento but she was she's part of a contractor and company that we have coming to the prison, and so I met her so I got to talking to her a little bit so we just been texting back and forth. And also i'm just branching out finding my space and that's about it really I don't know what her end game is I thought she kind of found her in game, but now i'm not so sure. But even at that, I mean she's been pretty clear she doesn't want to be with me, so I don't know I don't know what she wants. she's asked me twice now if I wanted to move into there if I plan on moving into the rental I said no hadn't planned on it. She says what your girlfriend akin to like you live in here with me, I said I don't have a girlfriend don't want a girlfriend. it's so like I said I don't know what she's coming from if she wants me to move out, I wish you just say so and. You know I asked dresses are you wanting me to you want me out of there she says no, or just she's still watch even say no. Jesus I just thought that maybe you were thinking about moving over there, like no i'm not but I don't know like I said I don't know what goes through her head she can't talk to me, without an argument so."
214.0,Provider,"So, like alright so let's let's just go, we don't know what the game plan is, but like. How are you managing to stay. At peace."
7340.0,Patient,"You know i'm in my own world. And in my own world you know i've got my own thing going on and working. paying the bills, you know, trying to save a little money get back ahead get a couple credit cards they're not bad, but get them paid off work on getting the truck paid off just kind of working towards that retirement. You know, we take it as it goes right now I can't afford to you know get another house and I told her I says, you know can't afford to house payments, she said, I can afford one house payment, but I can't afford to. I said, you can afford it now, I said but you're getting ready to get stuff surgery done so you're going to be down and now to work for a little while she goes well that's true. You know so like I said that's just where we're at you know financially that's not possible and reasonable to move on to go separate directions, as far as shelter goes. You know, and right now i'm fine with that you know I just TV in the master bedroom I hang out near most the time and I get some work done when I can get it done sleep when they need to catch up on sleep and i'm just live my own life."
214.0,Provider,"I listen, I totally hear what you're saying the honesty is great so let's just play let's just roll play this out a little bit when this this other young lady. gets more than texting. This is hypothetical not that there's anything wrong. know how are you going to feel about yourself, though, my concern is you."
7340.0,Patient,"I you know. I cannot, I mean she says bring my wife, says the ex wife, I guess says things that. You know, like she did asking me if i've had sex with somebody he didn't even ask she just told me with the assumption that I already had you know it's just rubbed me wrong to begin with, but other than that statement. You know, which is few and far between if at all, she's made it pretty clear that she can't be happy with me. And so that's where i'm at you know I don't expect anything from her I don't. not looking for us to have any kind of relationship, other than we have kids and a grandchild together, you know the rest, as far as financial and the houses and things like that will you know work itself out as as time and finances set it. On so you know i'm i'm doing what I want to do you know, whatever that may be at the given moment. You know so something works out with this Gal or you know we meet and have some dinner drinks, or something, then. You know, do that and we've talked about it, you know we have talked about doing that she's up in sacramento and that's about three and a half hours away. So we kind of talked about meeting halfway or something, and you haven't worked those details out with my workout is right now it's going to be tough anyway. Right, so you know just kind of rolling with it and i'm just kind of playing it by ear and see where it goes I don't expect anything to go backwards, I really don't. See like I said she's made it pretty clear that she doesn't that she can't be happy with me and. You know, other than making those statements. And I don't know you know it's it's hard, because I can't understand that she even cares. Or why she would or you know I mean what difference does it make if I had said yes, I had sex with somebody okay so what's the difference, you know you don't want me you don't want to have anything to do with me and you've made that pretty clear, so why are you even asking. You know, so I don't know it's just weird. But I don't take it to heart, I just kind of bounce that question in my head a little bit and move on."
214.0,Provider,Okay.
7340.0,Patient,So that's where i'm at with it.
214.0,Provider,"Oh, we back to point or not."
7340.0,Patient,"Back to point. uh yeah yeah I have been. yeah I have been Okay, so I you know. That Scott my own little you know, I was thinking about the other day was kind of an Epiphany it was weird because. I got let's see last Saturday night I went out. came home, she was out went and stayed somewhere all night and I just knew, she was going to and I don't know where she did. hindsight, I don't think she was with anybody I think she just did a friend's house. But you know six one half dozen other but Saturday night, it was kind of tore up in my own head just you know hate myself for getting myself in the life that we have now. getting us all in it. You know so it's pretty ticked off that night it myself and everything but and then you know once I kind of calm myself down and I watched a couple videos and. I just I think it may have been the next day, or maybe even Monday, it just kind of hit me that that is. And I don't it kind of sounds like it makes it better so maybe it's just an excuse, but it's I don't need anybody else I got me, you know this has been."
214.0,Provider,that's always been you though that's all.
7340.0,Patient,"it's not a good thing, but kind of just an Epiphany that you know Okay, so you know I watch some porn and I take care of me and i'm i'm i've got me I don't need anybody else. You know i'm just gonna put myself in that position, and like I said it's not. it's not necessarily good thing but. it's me it's it's it's who i've always been so i'm trying to decide if I should be fighting that anymore."
214.0,Provider,"I well I, the only reason I bring it up is is because I listen i'm."
7340.0,Patient,gonna call me on it definitely.
214.0,Provider,"yeah when you when you talk about your marriage. I think you know the way you describe it it's like this is unrepairable and yep i'll take the full boat so when we talk about the point it's not whether or not like you're doing it again, it was already done right, you know we basically implement this thing got imploded anyway. Well, if if I use point now. The implosions the implosion that doesn't. generate this. Right right so like I want to respect you for what you believe you know I gotta do me is, but you know, at the end of the day, I am concerned about like. You know what will will not be Epiphany be like we've been doing this for 10 years this shit is crazy like. yeah and I know its financial I get like i'll respect to the all the way, but it's like at some point it's kind of be like okay Can someone just pull the trigger. and so on. You know."
7340.0,Patient,I think I think we'll get to that point as far as I.
214.0,Provider,do so.
7340.0,Patient,"I think. You know, I think, like, I said that she wasn't having surgery, and I knew, she was going to be down for a while, without a job and could afford. You know, like she's making money now a house payment yeah i'd either move out or offer she if she was moving into the other house right now the renders just moved out so we're looking for renters for it. Sure, so it's open but yeah i'm not going to you know, and she she follows up with that statement will don't worry about me i've got two kids that will take me in and they okay that's great but that's not right, you know they don't need the burden that's not that's not fair to them."
214.0,Provider,Right it's not that it's not their job.
7340.0,Patient,"No and it's sweet did they will and i'm proud that they do, but it's just not the right way to go, so. that's where we're at right now, you know, and so, when she gets to the surgery, and she gets going again and, who knows we'll see what happens at that point, you know, but in meantime I just kind of see us being roommates and living separate lives."
214.0,Provider,"Okay, and how's how's. how's your mood been so I haven't seen one of the flare ups in a long time."
7340.0,Patient,"Now, like I said I got i've got pretty flared up Saturday Saturday night I was just well when I was drunk so that didn't help much but. You know, I was just down on my shelf, you know just kind of a slap of reality here I am home alone, again, you know that kind of thing. But you know I worked through it, you know yelled and screamed and kind of got it out of my system and vented you know within my own little world, and you know nobody's here, so I could scream as loud, as I want, and I did. Just kind of kind of work through that moment, I guess you might say, you know so other than that i've been good, I really have been doing all right. You know, making it through the day and."
214.0,Provider,Night still working at walmart.
7340.0,Patient,"yep that's fun it's tiring because it's a rough hours, but I just have fun with people you know i'd mess with them and screw with them and let's talk to some. Lady about cooking pork chops yesterday because she had a big a bunch of pork chops in her bag talk to another lady about. You know she went back to get eggs, milk and wine, and I was bragging on her about that the perfect meal thing for a while and having fun with the kids while they're waiting for their parents check it out and just just having fun with it it's pretty cool. Alright, so taking the medication yep. yep still doing that I haven't Saturday made me kind of think about. You know the whole depression aspect again. So it kind of made me rethink that yeah Okay, maybe we're not ready to step down further yet. Excuse me, at that point, I was kind of thinking you know, maybe I need to step up again, but like I said it was a moment, we made it through that night, you know those are going to happen, I gotta be real about that. So yeah doing yeah status quo like I said earlier. So."

I don't remember, I was texting that Gal from South sacramento and we were bantering back and forth and just having a good fun conversation, and my mood change because that was the that's what it was that. Friday night I think when my wife, you know started yelling me about drinking and driving. And I apologize, you know I told her I said sorry my mood kind of changed, I should just got an argument with my ex and she's like Okay, I understand, so the piece of that was just kind of having somebody to share that moment with so that was kind of cool you know she's. I don't know she's probably too good to be true, because she's a real sweetheart and she's real kind and Nice and not somebody that I probably she's probably too good for me, but hey she's likes me and we're having fun together, right now, so.

Knowing that that's not gonna work, I am looking for other people to reach out to my did confide in a friend at work that you know my wife and i's relationship is over he's the only person i've told. And because I know I can trust him to keep quiet about it, you know, so it doesn't spread around it work but. You know so yeah i'm learning to reach out there, trying to Dan and that's kind of really my goal in all of this with talking to other people and.
