17052.0,Patient,"Honestly, no, I really don't because I felt like for a very long time that. The world owes me something surely that's how I really did feel some kind of way the world had wronged me. And a. number of years just recently to. Really learn that that's in my control and out of my control and what I mean by that is that I was literally seeking out failure. Because I was choosing to do nothing about it. And therefore resenting myself, and in turn resenting the world even further. So it, it took me a little while to learn what I was doing to myself. And once I started to realize that I became a whole lot less and angrier with everything around me and myself. And started to actually enjoy life, a little. And now yeah I get I get angry about shit. yeah I do but it's not something that i'm like so grateful over or like. Seeking. or or ventilating over my anger and the reason why i'm so angry and now i'm even matter, because I am angry you don't I mean and then further further. So I recognize all of that, and I see all that and I understand it, for the most part, I do believe. And I don't walk around with a chip on my shoulder as badly as I used to it's. All up to me."

298.0,Provider,"Okay. Sorry anything i've not asked you, that would be really good to know."

17052.0,Patient,"Well, when I start to worry a lot about things, or what. Maybe I forgot, something that was asked of me or something like that and i've forgotten or just not maybe remembered and I started getting a little free to help this is not not not like i'm not trying to do it, or anything like that I just.

298.0,Provider,"um are you hyper vigilant, are you like looking over your shoulder and make sure you feel safe when you're outside."
17052.0,Patient,"I do constantly all the time, regardless, no matter where i'm out it doesn't matter."

17052.0,Patient,yeah.
298.0,Provider,How often.
17052.0,Patient,I try not to remember my dreams.
298.0,Provider,"That makes sense. it's a it's avoidance of yeah. i'm. It sounds like you have some ptsd that is causing possibly some low serotonin levels, you can do some research on it, I have no agenda to push anything on you. But what happens with long term. Long term ptsd is. Just low serotonin and when your serotonin levels go down. you've had have your anxiety goes up they've done studies to to look at the cerebral spinal fluid of people with chronic. ptsd and what they found was very low serotonin levels, you can look at ways to it naturally increase your serotonin levels, but sometimes the only thing that can help is get medication that put serotonin there. Would you like to look at doing some more therapy on some things that happened in the past and look at and at trauma."
17052.0,Patient,yeah.
298.0,Provider,"i'm going to make a recommendation at this point that. That the you look into I mean i'm going to make a recommendation that you get some trauma therapy. And it's up to you, you if you if you find out you don't like it please don't think that you have to do it, I just think that sometimes if you deal with some of the underlying causes of anxiety it sure does help things, though. So that's all I have for you at this point, unless, and you can think about it, unless you wanted to start a medication. Other than that i'm going to make a recommendation, you see a trauma therapist here right heart."
17052.0,Patient,Okay.
298.0,Provider,"Okay, so."
17052.0,Patient,I don't even know what I would ask for for.
298.0,Provider,"I know that's okay you don't have to um. I just think it would be good to talk with somebody about your mental health talk about the anxiety and it kind of what i've seen with people is, if you can kind of get it out your mouth, then it has less of a physical response on the body. So. All right, that's all I need from you, Christopher, thank you for taking time to meet with me."
17052.0,Patient,"Of course, thank you for."
