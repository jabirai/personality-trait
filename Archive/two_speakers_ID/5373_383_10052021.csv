The idea but. um they're going to look around, for me, but as of right now i'm i'm working with general assistance and. My doctor like extended my disability and i'm going to see if I can work out something with my landlord or I can help her out around the prob re."
383.0,Provider,Oh great.
5373.0,Patient,yeah so.
383.0,Provider,"So you're you're getting some general assistance, you said, your. Your your doctor you're extending your disability so she didn't require you to get it different doctor she's still going to work with you."
5373.0,Patient,know is to basically was like here's here's here's your paperwork don't talk to me again. And i'm okay with that.
383.0,Provider,Okay. He is. Working on a different doctor.

383.0,Provider,Okay.
5373.0,Patient,she's really nice.
383.0,Provider,Okay wonderful.
5373.0,Patient,"yeah she's really cool and i'm. When I told her that I was having these random sporadic seizures and all my doctors were blaming it on the adderall she's like she's like half of my epileptic patients. Are take adderall and that's that has nothing to do with it, if you're going to have one you're going to have one she thinks. i'm. I have symptoms, I guess, of general and focal epilepsy, so one can be treated with surgery. And no one can be treated like in one is just. Like a manageable. um so I get to be a guinea pig for like a week and stay at ucsf for a few days and they're gonna have me on no medication and try to induce seizures like that sounds terrible so. But it, but at least like it's going to get done, you know. she's she's she seems like that, like the like a really, really nice doctor i'm happy about it."
383.0,Provider,So you're wanting to do the study that she's. it's something that's important to you do you feel like you want to do that study.
5373.0,Patient,"Well, I have to because that's where I was referred to by my doctor to get treated for my epilepsy um and my um my insurance covers it so."
383.0,Provider,Well that's great that you like your doctor and you feel that you know she's got some good recommendations for you.
5373.0,Patient,"Yes, she's definitely she thinks she thinks it's worse than I thought it is because i'm. i'm. like this symptom there were there were symptoms that she was asking me that I didn't even realize I had that were related to it like um and you've seen this where I would just stop mid sentence and then like my words will just get slower and slower and that's part of it um. So at least I have some answer. yeah. And then at least it's not Dr Chu who just thought I was on drugs, she literally thought that."
383.0,Provider,I write.
5373.0,Patient,"horrible lady. yeah but um. yeah so. yeah that's happening, and I, the thing with my landlords kind of a funny story i'll tell you real quick So yes, so I broke my I got I spilled water on my gate fog. And it broke. And so I. called her yesterday and i'm like hey so our wheel square for right now, like you know I did the 25% what's going on with the utility bills and she doesn't know. And she sounded really stressed out and saw it on like hey you know I got I got a little free time and if you need some help around the property just let me know. and So, then, I want. have to kind of like worry about the tension with that."
383.0,Provider,Okay.
5373.0,Patient,"Right now, at least, like i'm buying myself i'm doing a good job by myself, some time to plan."
383.0,Provider,that's good. yeah and how are you doing with setting boundaries in your relationship.
5373.0,Patient,"yeah. I bought a book That said, I literally have a book and it's called boundaries when to say no. I. I bought I am so my boundaries like there and it's. Making me come off kind of like a bit, to be honest, to be, but I really don't care because I just don't have time for it i'm just i've just been really upfront because people misunderstand me, I don't know if it's a if I say things to nicely or if I say it wrong, but people like. You know, especially guys um but the but Ben the guy was talking to you about last week um. So he's in a recovery program and i've been helping him out with that too. Which is a gamble. But um. yeah you know. he's got he's got it. he's got a good job he's got a two bedroom house or a two story house with four bedrooms and he was by himself and he just wants, you know i'm i'm making him go to meetings every week."
383.0,Provider,Okay. yeah you mean you're encouraging him to go to meetings.
5373.0,Patient,yeah because I said I would go see him if you doesn't.
383.0,Provider,"What kind of addiction, does he have."
5373.0,Patient,"Okay, I don't understand at all, how you can be addicted academy like I mean, but he. is really addicted academy and. I. So I really want him to get help."
383.0,Provider,mm hmm.
5373.0,Patient,and
383.0,Provider,Okay.
5373.0,Patient,"And that in that meeting is a niles so I know, like a lot of people there and um and any is so cool like i'm introducing him to like my sober friends and they've been getting along and. um you know so that's. I. Am and he's he's cool I don't I don't know if I need them in my life, right now, but. it's potentially as a place to stay, if we do end up getting in a relationship. My cat loves his dogs."
383.0,Provider,"Well, are you not in a relationship now."
5373.0,Patient,I haven't been.
383.0,Provider,"Okay, I thought you were staying over there, sometimes it has place."
5373.0,Patient,"I stay over there, sometimes we know that, like we do have boundaries we've never actually like. You know, made it like. We we never we've never done anything and that's what's funny too is because we care about each other that much where we don't want to like with anything we want to make sure cuz i'm."
383.0,Provider,that's really good.
5373.0,Patient,"yeah but he can become an asshole. He literally threw a party, the other night and. Like he he said that he likes me so much they you wanted to get me mad, so I wouldn't talk to him, so he spent half the time face timing some chick nobody knew. and his friend had to walk up to him and be like you, are being so rude right now I and then he but, but what I do like about him is he apologizes. Which is kind of like sad that I appreciate that, but he does apologize any means it to."
383.0,Provider,Right. yeah so. You know there's there's boundary setting and then there's kind of deciding and getting clarity about what you will accept in a relationship and what you won't.
5373.0,Patient,Right I won't accept him doing ketamine no way I don't want that.
383.0,Provider,mm hmm.
5373.0,Patient,"I don't want that, like yeah i'm trying to get disability I want I don't want to risk anything because of that, like. He needs to make better friends or go to synagogue or something like."

383.0,Provider,i'm glad you're doing better this week you look better i'm glad to see you in your own place i'm glad you're reading a book about boundaries. I think you'd be really great if you could work on your sleep schedule and see if you can you know get to bed a little bit earlier and get up and.
5373.0,Patient,get up.
383.0,Provider,"and go to bed, the same time, every day, is what's recommended."
5373.0,Patient,"yeah, and this is what's crazy like i'm since i've been noticing that I have been just this tired i've been doing that and I i'm trying not to take my adderall. Even though I know I need it like especially right now, but I want to see if. That. Maybe not taking it is making me tired I don't know like I mean, but I didn't stop it completely because that could cause a seizure if I just stopped taking it."
383.0,Provider,yeah I i'm glad you have an appointment with chantel you know. so that you can go over you know. Your medicine.
5373.0,Patient,"For sure yeah it's yeah it's about time for that um because I. um. yeah something something's not right something's definitely different like physically um. And it might be. And it's not just the stress, because I feel I feel i'm not stressed, too, but i'm. To be honest with you the pressure of going to the group is kind of stressful. that's a lot of stress, because I did I had a job interview. On Thursday, and also ben's meetings on Thursdays, too, and I don't really want to go back to this, so the one with Riley."
383.0,Provider,"Because he's been here he's he's not in he's not in the group's anymore. You know I mean I want you to prioritize your mental health. With regards to your you know your friends meetings that I will. You know i'm going to your schedule, just to attend group every twice a month, so it's just twice a it's not every every week it's every other week. So I think we, you know. If you can prioritize yourself on those days."
5373.0,Patient,"doesn't have to be a set time like can it be like Friday one day Thursday, one day, or does it."
383.0,Provider,"yeah, it has to be a regular group that."
5373.0,Patient,That.
383.0,Provider,were assigned to.
5373.0,Patient,See that's what's hard um. huh.
383.0,Provider,"yeah um well I can't really change the requirements of bright heart health, you know, requesting that you that we brought your group frequency attendance down to twice per month, so. that's about all I can do, you can talk about it with shontelle there's another day that would. be better for you than the. Year scheduled for the Thursday group right."
5373.0,Patient,He yeah I think you have a chance i'll have an 11 on Friday group right.
383.0,Provider,yeah that group is pretty full right now so um. I don't know if there's base in that group.
5373.0,Patient,"Could you let me know it's like someone drops, because that sounds i'm. Better. is definitely better either like like maybe earlier in the day, rather than just the middle of a Thursday I think that's what makes it so hard sometimes is it's just smack DAB in the middle of the day."
383.0,Provider,yeah um.
5373.0,Patient,"i'll figure it out with shauntel and i'll work my schedule with the um. I. But other than that yeah so i'm i'm keeping your suggestions in mind and. i'm gonna. I do. I do want to like help, then I really do like I mean, I know I come back to that, but I I need it. um. I don't want to say save somebody. That sounds wrong but it."
383.0,Provider,"can be in that can be an impetus you may be feeling that. But you want to remind yourself right now is you know you need you need your own. To save yourself first right, we need to turn ourselves first and then. REACH it. we're getting to the end of our time frame. I did put you in for an appointment in two weeks at 1130 the same time on a Tuesday in two weeks."
