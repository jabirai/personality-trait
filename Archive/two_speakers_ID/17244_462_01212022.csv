462.0,Provider,hi Lisa. hi how are you doing today.
17244.0,Patient,How are you.
462.0,Provider,"doing good Thank you. yeah so today is a bio cycle social assessment, which is basically me just kind of asking questions to gather information around what's going on with you overall. physically emotionally socially you know kind of in every area and. A little bit about the past too, but I just wanted to see do you have any questions for me."
17244.0,Patient,"No, no yeah."
462.0,Provider,"All right, yeah for sure if anything pops up feel free to just let me know. Okay, and can I just get started by having you state your full name and date of birth."
17244.0,Patient,Lisa Marie Seville 623 68.
462.0,Provider,"perfect and then just another thing that I let everyone know is the limits of confidentiality so everything that you share with me is kept confidential between myself and the bright heart health treatment team. Unless you have intention to harm yourself harm someone else, or you let me know about any type of child abuse or neglect or elder abuse or neglect those things, I do have to report, otherwise confidential okay okay. All right, so let's just start with what brings you in today and how did you end up at bright heart health."
17244.0,Patient,"um well I needed to get some counseling done just because you know. I am a former alcoholic. And I have been sober for almost four months now. And just learning how to deal with life on life's terms, without you know, using alcohol and I think you're the first person i've actually told in bright heart health just because. A lot of times you tell someone you're an alcoholic then when it comes to prescribing medication they don't prescribe you things because they don't want you to get addicted and. And i'm definitely not one that takes pills, I am not a pill ticker they did put me on so loft. For Depression and anxiety because I have. I think you know a lot of my drinking was to deal with Depression and anxiety. I guess. My drinking was just like just to. You know, forget life for a little while and. You know, but like I said i'm now not doing that I lost a lot of relationships with that and i'm just now getting them back and i'm so excited about that. i'm doing twin town, which is an outpatient program i'm doing a I have a sponsor i'm working the steps i'm actually on step 12. um you know so i'm just doing everything that I possibly can to not drink and. Which is actually not too hard right now it's not it's not hard. But just keeping a schedule doing some meditations exercising you know just I guess I need like a combination of things like before I just tried a that didn't work I just tried. You know, an outpatient program that didn't work, so I guess, for me, I need a little bit of everything so that's what i'm doing this time and it seems to be working, and you know just taking it one day at a time and not putting myself in situations to where there's alcohol. There I don't allow alcohol in my home, you know I don't know around with people that drink, so you know, so I guess when town, I only have once a week now, so I really needed therapy to kind of fill in that gap. Right or the other time to keep me a little bit more consistent and accountable and so that's that's why i'm here, and you know there's just. My anxiety comes out of my sleep and that's why they put me on medication, but zoloft apparently is not as to date of medication and that's what they put me off and and it's really helping with the anxiety and depression completely, but the sleeping. Man, you know I used to hit the pillow and just go out with this medication, it takes me like almost a couple hours to fall asleep and the psychiatry gave me an Anti histamine and a histamine sure. And I took it the other day and man, I was so groggy when I woke up the next morning and I was I didn't like it. So the last couple of nights I haven't taken it I am falling asleep, but I still wake up, you know which is normal to go to the bathroom where my husband snow. i'm like honey. But it's amit a couple days a week ago, when this the the empty bedroom and sleep just to get more like a longer period of sleep without waking up him snoring or whatever, and that does help. But that's my anxiety is always come out and my sleep and I don't know why."
462.0,Provider,i'm.
17244.0,Patient,"Okay, I guess it's. Just everybody."
462.0,Provider,yeah it definitely can impact sleep that happens to a lot of people so did you say that since you started taking the medication your sleep has gotten worse you.
17244.0,Patient,Know it's the falling asleep.
462.0,Provider,Part falling asleep okay okay.
17244.0,Patient,"Like I mean I work part time I exercise I walk on in daily like I exercise daily anywhere from 30 minutes hour. And you know it's just like i'm just having a hard time it's almost like a restless type feeling like like I can't get comfortable I flip and toss and turn and toss and turn and then all of a sudden at about 1230. Now. Until about four or five in the morning. And then I am able to get up get a drink of water go to the bathroom and go back to sleep, so it is getting better, but I really think it's a little bit of the snoring."
462.0,Provider,"Okay. But something that you're working on, but is is impacting you now, and on the."
17244.0,Patient,"yeah but it's just. I don't understand why it's it's taken me a long time to fall asleep that's what I don't stand and you know I have, I have a son who's 22 who special needs. he's got a processing disorder physically he's fine. But it's just. You know, schooling he's like 22 but mentally he's like 16. And you know that that lays heavy on my mind every day yeah and you know just his emotional issues that he struggles with you know he's tried to find a job he's struggling with that I have him working with harbor regional taken a while and. You know my husband and him don't see eye to eye. Because my husband it's his my second marriage and all this with Luke is new to him, because he has three sons that are functioning, you know normally and so he's not really familiar with the way Luke thinks the way he responds to things and sometimes it can get a little. emotional, for me, because it does give me anxiety and when they're not. Being nice to."
462.0,Provider,"each other, some time here, of course."
17244.0,Patient,"And he thought, yesterday I just told them, you know I can't like you guys have to communicate I can't be go between because it's just it's too much for me."
462.0,Provider,"A lot for you right now, especially as you're working on recovery."
17244.0,Patient,"yeah and so you know, so we went to the park and we went on a nice block yesterday and we just kind of talk things out so i'm hoping that it helps. But you know i've had these conversations before with my husband and he'll do good for a little while and then he'll start making little jabs and comments and and i'm like you don't need to comment on every frickin thing he does or says things Luke says, sometimes comes out wrong. And Sergio doesn't always understand why he's like that so then he gets, why do you do that, why you know and i'm just like stop it. But you know i'm we're around each other, a lot, because you know everybody's still kind of because it covidien everybody's still home a lot and. Why, you know we're going on two years of this crap and well actually over two years, and so you know we're kind of I think sometimes you're getting on each other's nerves and picking and I just you know. I don't want to deal with that and I, but I don't know what to do. To not cause friction. Between you know between him and I are between Luke and him. So I guess I need a little help on that, and you know I need to set some boundaries. But i'm just kind of stuck like I can only do so much and saved so much, and they have to really like my son needs counseling too so i'm going to work on that too right. he's got a father, who has pretty much nothing to do with them and it's laying really heavy on him. Right and for me to have to see that every day it's it's. You know that's why I would drink, because I just wanted it now I didn't want to. Think about anybody else's stuff, I just wanted to be left alone and sleep pretty much. Right, but you know I can't deal with life like that it's not fair to me."
462.0,Provider,doesn't solve anything okay.
17244.0,Patient,No so that's me.
462.0,Provider,"Alright, so that's some of the bigger stuff going on in recovery and then trying to learn how to cope with your household stress with like you said, your son has. A disability and they're your husband and him are having a tough time and you're kind of in the middle, which is a tough place to be. So a little bit of boundary work it sounds like communication, all that will be very important, so when did you start drinking."
17244.0,Patient,"um I started drinking well you know. After high school pretty much you know but. It wasn't a daily thing it was just like you know, having a couple beers at a party, you know here and there, but when it started to get really bad as when I divorced, my first husband and. And you know just going through that stress and then like a dummy I got into a relationship with a childhood friend longtime friend of mine. And he was a heavy drinker and I was only drinking like maybe wine once in a while a beer once in a while, except for when I would go to parties and I noticed that I was drinking more. And then, when him and I got together, it was. more often. Like every weekend whenever we were together and then something happened with him and I. I had sold my house moved down here to be closer to him. My son came with me. And you know he started like sitting when I moved and everything he started looking at other women and everything and it just devastated me, because here I moved my whole entire life. Be with this person thinking that he was the one, and this was it and you know and for him to do stuff like that I was just like oh my God, what did I do so, I started drinking really heavy just to. not feel that remorse and that that that hurt and that pain and it just got worse and worse so. You know, and then we're know we were no longer together and it's just back and forth back and forth for about four years. And my to go to was just alcohol, these are like the way it may feel let me forget things it didn't make anything better because I hope I lost a lot of jobs, I lost a lot of stuff. You know, but so it's been a battle since. Probably 2016."
462.0,Provider,Okay.
17244.0,Patient,on and off.
462.0,Provider,And when it was more off what was going on.
17244.0,Patient,"When it was more off, I was working programs I did celebrate recovery for a year, and you know kept me sober for a while, but you know, I was an emotional drinker and I couldn't deal with the emotional stuff. and I would go on and off and on off and then I ended up going to rehab. And I stayed sober for about three months, but I was still in that relationship with this person and I shouldn't have been. And it just tore me up and I started drinking again stop doing my program you know, and then you know I just would battle on and off and then this last time and then I met my husband I knew him for a while, then I met my new husband and you know we were drinking and you know. He knew I had an issue, and you know, but he stuck by my side, this whole time. They end up getting married and you know my life has been a lot less stressful but the drinking still continued. Just because of other pressures, I had my own business, and there was a lot of pressure, you know really physical really busy so just to not think about it, you know I would drink and it just it just got out of control to where you know I almost lost my husband. I lost the relationship with my girls my drinking, I never let it affect my kids and my relationship with them, but this last round about I did and that's when I knew this has got to stop because i'm just now getting i'm able to talk to my girls on the phone. And you know I don't want to lose that again, I know that if I drink that i'm going to lose everything that i've worked so hard for the last four months and I don't want to do that, so you know. yeah just just stay in the course that's been really hard for me to just continue, and I want to continue and I don't want to pick up because I don't want to lose anything okay."
462.0,Provider,All right. And then currently do you use any substances other than what you're prescribed to. know nothing at all marijuana tobacco.
17244.0,Patient,"Tobacco yes. Okay, yes, I am down to about two cigarettes a day which is good."
462.0,Provider,"Okay, that was really good."
17244.0,Patient,"All right, so working. But other than that I don't take I mean I was taking a sleeping pill like a sleep aid because. I had talked to the psychologist last week and I said man, I said I just can't fall asleep on this zoloft I don't know what's going on, I take this all up in the morning, as soon as I get up. And then, so at nighttime I don't I mean I don't really understand how the law works. I thought it would work in two weeks and she's like no. So i'm like Okay, so I mean I it's going on my second month of taking it and i'm willing to give it because it's really working for anxiety and depression and that's a big for me, but sleep you got to get your sleep, so I took a. sleep aid. Like a kirkland brand Pasco sleep aid. And that helps and that one doesn't make me feel as groggy but this, the one that she prescribed to think it's a little bit stronger, but that one may be so worried like rocky the next day, I mean it went."
462.0,Provider,"away at those are like prescription grade and. Like you said so it's it's pretty strong. Maybe you could even try, just like a benadryl that's you know that's not prescription grade that might make you feel less girl who'd been helped. You could."
17244.0,Patient,"yeah I think. Well, the kirkland brand is dope Doc see something so it's Anna his."
462.0,Provider,"Okay, all right good yeah."
17244.0,Patient,"So I mean either one and I like I said I don't take it unless i've gone like three days without sleeping real good then i'm like oh forget it, and I take it. And it's mine. But I don't like to feel that way because I got to get up and work, you know someday. All all do you know, and I do drink caffeine in the morning I don't drink it in the afternoon. I kind of cut back because i'm doing like half and half half caffeine have decaf now. Because I was thinking well, maybe that's why i'm having trouble falling asleep at night, but I don't think so because. For the zoloft I was. It was fine."
462.0,Provider,"yeah Okay, well, we can just continue to monitor and keep trying to to work on that, but that's that's great that you're not using any other substances, right now, have you used any other substances in the past."
17244.0,Patient,Like how far back.
462.0,Provider,anytime in your life.
17244.0,Patient,"mean for a couple of years, but that all stopped when I was in my."
462.0,Provider,20s okay.
17244.0,Patient,"I never I never mind, I think I smoked marijuana like twice my whole life. didn't look good. But other than that it was just been pretty much alcohol."
462.0,Provider,"Okay, all right. And then, can you just tell me a little bit about your earlier life, where were you born, who raised you what was your family life, like as a young young person."
17244.0,Patient,"um I was born in long beach California born and raised there by my mom and my dad been married for going on 56 years, and you know I had a really good home life I was raised in a you know, a church going home. My mom did get sick when I was very young, she was almost. taken out by two strokes, that she had when she was 30 years old, which was really odd she had a blood clot and an aneurysm and if she didn't drink she didn't smoke she didn't do drugs, she was perfectly healthy. But I was nine and that had a really bad big impact on me and my sister was like five at the time, and you know she's to this day, one of the strongest woman that I know she was paralyzed completely on her right side her arm her legs she wears a brace and walks with a cane. She never regained regain strength, or anything so my dad you know pretty much took care of US my mom was able to do things around the House, you know she was a homemaker her whole life. But. You know she was never the same person sure her mind is still like a child. I mean, she can talk she still has problems getting her words out and I noticed that it went from getting good to now she's still suffers with that as she's getting older and and her. recollection i've noticed the past couple years it's kind of gone downhill um but you know my my dad. Make sure that as girls there's three of us, I have a younger sister or two younger sisters that we had everything he did everything with us took us places I mean, I had a good childhood, I really did. It was just my mom you know she couldn't drive she couldn't take us places, so it was always my father, so my relationship with my dad is a little bit closer than with my mom. You know she. is very hot she was very hard. On me as a child. As far as the way we looked the way our weight was because she's very she cares a lot about how she looks and her weight and so you know when I was 10. You know you're going through puberty and all that I was a little chunky and she put me on a weight watchers diet at 10 so me I was getting too chunky and you know I lost like 10 pounds or something but. Since then i've always had an issue with the way I looked at how much I weigh."
462.0,Provider,Definitely done.
17244.0,Patient,"That and I carried that with me like my whole life, but you know the past, I have to say, the past. oh five or five years well know. Probably the past couple years since i'm older i'm like you know what screw that. I am, who I am you know i'm 53 years old, I don't think I look bad for 53 I work out I eat right, you know. I tried to take good care of. And i'm just i'm just like you know what I don't have to worry about that my husband loves me the way I. Am and you know, but I carry that for so long, I mean to this day it's funny because, like my mom will come over with my dad or i'll go over there and. And i'm like Why do my hair and wear nice clothes and my husband's like what's wrong with what's what's going on and i'm like. he's like you know he goes every time you go to see your mom you are so worried about how you look and how your hair is night and he's like Lisa he's like you know just come down because she'll make comments like. You need your hair done or you know stuff like that, and it just and i'm like so you know I try to let it go, but it still hurts. And you know so but i'm working on that you know, and I told her straight out folder you know what don't say those kind of things to me because it hurts me and she's like oh i'm sorry i'm sorry, you know so she really try she's been trying to be better about it. But you know, so my whole life, you know Lisa had to be perfect. Right."
462.0,Provider,And a lot of pressure.
17244.0,Patient,"A lot of pressure and now i'm at the point where you know what. I am, who I am and. You know, going through menopause right now it's really hard for me to get the weight off, and so you know it's a struggle, because I like to eat. So you know but i'm just i'm like i'm not putting that pressure on myself when I work out I work out when I eat I eat nine so."
462.0,Provider,"yeah well good for you, it sounds like you've definitely thought about that a lot and just for setting the boundary hey don't comment on my physical appearance anymore. It hurts me that's really a big step."

17244.0,Patient,"um. OK, so my my daughter my oldest daughter. She is. Very high anxious person, and you know i'm just getting my relationship back with her and she just got she's just getting over covert right now she lives in redlands California, and you know I sometimes don't. know how to help her because she'll call me and text me, you know this is wrong, I think sometimes she's a hypochondriac really because. When there's some little tiny thing she blows it up into a big thing, and she doctors doctors doctors testers you know, and I think a lot of her issue is anxiety, but she doesn't want to take medication for it. And I want to be there for her, and I want to help her, but you know i'm the kind of person because of lack of help you know falling asleep at night I can't talk to people late on the phone at nighttime because then my mind's just. assure you know so i'm trying to. be there for her and help her but. You know. I don't want to tell her you know I can't talk to you and I, because it just gets me anxious and I can't go to sleep. You know, so I tried to talk to her during the daytime. or not past like eight or nine o'clock at night, but I guess, I guess, I just need help on. You know, dealing with her anxiety sometimes gets me. Because I don't know what to do, for her, and you know, and I like yesterday, I told her I said Melanie I said, you need to be on anxiety medication."
462.0,Provider,yeah I was just gonna say she receiving any type of clinical support.
17244.0,Patient,"She has a therapist they actually gave her medication that she has in her hand because she doesn't want to take it. yeah and I told her I said, you know what now and I said I have been dealing with that, for years I said i'm now on medication and it's you know and it hasn't been easy. But i'm taking it and it's helping me and I said, you have to start somewhere, and you know, in the long run it'll it'll be okay, you know, and I go I go it's helping me and. So you know I just have to but she's going to do what she's going to do, but the thing is. she's constantly. trying to get advice from people, but she doesn't want to take the advice that you give her and use it. And you know I don't want to be harsh with her because i'm just trying to get my relationship back. I get frustrated because i'm like you asked me for advice I give it to you, but you don't do anything about it. But then I. Think in my mind, for years, she was telling me mommy need to stop drinking mom you need to."
462.0,Provider,Tell.
17244.0,Patient,"me, you know, and I was like I don't need help, I don't know so you know i'm trying to have an open mind, be patient with her like she was patient with me so."
462.0,Provider,"yeah and that sounds like a good perspective. You know, part of it is going to be striking a balance between you, supporting her being there for her encouraging her to seek help and then also setting your own boundaries like. nighttime is just not going to work for you that's not the time that you're going to counsel her and console her feelings right, you can pick it up in the morning, so some. Just thinking about what that balance looks like maybe even listening out the boundaries like. You know not no talking at nighttime. On a day, where you're just have so much other stress going on having to table it until next time you know just maybe thinking about for you. how you can provide that support that encouragement, as her mother, even when she's not willing to seek help take the meds whatever it may be, but also protect your protect yourself your recovery your anxiety."
17244.0,Patient,yeah yeah. yeah that's true you know and i'll have to let her know that and she'll be receptive I mean she'll be you know she'll be okay with that you know and and i'm honestly it's like. One of the reasons why I drank was because I was so afraid to tell my kids I can't do this right now. i'm didn't let them down and I didn't want them to see the fear in me. And last time I you know I just. I just drank.
462.0,Provider,"yeah yeah it's hard to show that, like what's viewed as maybe a weakness right, but you can actually start to flip that thought process and view it as leading by example right, you can see, oh wow she's really protecting her recovery and her mental health that's. Really, something you know, and so, think of it. As leading by example, doing the hard thing rather than showing some type of weakness or letting them down."
17244.0,Patient,"yeah and you know that's what i'm trying to do now, you know but. I noticed that when I get off the phone with her i'm just like I feel kind of you know, anxious and. You know. I just you know, like I said, I have to put up boundaries, you know you know and another thing because i've always been everybody support. i've always helping my kids helping my parents helping my sister's help."
462.0,Provider,Right right.
17244.0,Patient,"And I have since I you know stopped drinking, you know i've just been like i'm sorry but I can't do that, right now, my parents got obeyed and got very, very sick and they went to visit my sister in utah and utah Idaho. Because they don't wear masks. And they went to visit my sister and my sister calls me and she's like I hate to tell you this mom and dad have co bit and i'm like oh great and I have tried everything in my power to protect my parents from this, you know thing. And my sister got it and from the babysitter that came in that she let in and didn't wear a mask. And so my parents were sick for almost two months. I think they they should have been my dad probably should have been in the hospital because he's got. Respiratory issues he's older my mom has tons of underlining conditions they had fevers for two weeks diarrhea."
462.0,Provider,Oh that's.
17244.0,Patient,"Hardly breathe, it was terrible so when they came home before they should have. They still had covered and they flew and I was mad about that. And my sister was telling me that when they got home that I needed to go and give my mom a bath. because she couldn't bathe her when she was there on the right thing and I said so you're telling me that I need to go put myself in a situation to catch covert because my mom needs me to help her face. And she's like yeah you have to help them and i'm like Rachel ever since I can remember i've been helping my mom and dad and now they go to visit you and they get coven and you're telling me that I have to meet and my husband and my kid in a situation to catch code and I said i'm. Sorry, but, and I was in twin town six days a week, then and being coached to set boundaries, and I was like i'm sorry but I said I will call a nurse to come in and help moms and then. They wanted me to pick them up from the airport and I had to tell them i'm sorry I will call you an uber it was so rough for me to say no to them, but I had to to protect myself and my family and. You know, and they got home and they were sick with code for like over a month and my dad was like I need to go to the doctors, I need you to take me I can't drive and I said dad I said i'm sorry but I just can't. and After he thought about it goes, I understand you know, so I called him an uber. And then they had gotten better just before thanksgiving and I told him I said. You need to get tested my mom still hadn't showered. Like she hadn't had a shower for over a month, she was just kind of sponge and i'm like."
462.0,Provider,I said why yeah.
17244.0,Patient,"yeah and I said, you need to shower before I come over there you guys need to have your test redone before I. Can for you, and so my mom showered and I said, if you need any help for me, these are what I need from you. And they got their test back, they were negative so thanksgiving we were all together, and it was great, but you know i'm learning, you know that it's okay for Lisa to set boundaries and it's okay for me to say no, because I have to think of me."
462.0,Provider,"yeah that's great i'm you know i'm glad to hear that that's just such a tough situation, but like you said they're putting it all on you and you just. You you can't be everyone's everything and sacrifice your own health your family's health right so but it sounds like you're really already working on that boundary setting process but it's an ongoing one and it's."
17244.0,Patient,"it's hard it is. It is yeah and you know I got mad at my sister because she was like oh you're just too paranoid and you're just so afraid of this coven and I said, you know what i'm not I go to the gym I wear my masks I washed my hands I."
462.0,Provider,mean paranoid then yeah gardens were sick really sick for two months that's. yeah I don't want to do that.
17244.0,Patient,"You know, and I said but i'm not going to go and someone's got co but i'm not going to go like yeah i'm gonna help you."
462.0,Provider,"yeah. yeah you know very fair. Well yeah so you've got some some good goals and things to work on there that we can kind of start putting on your treatment plan and get a little bit more specific, as time goes on. I see you did join your Monday group already. yeah okay so that's a weekly occurrence, and then we can schedule you for next time now so we'll be meeting, starting at every other week. Is there any day that's so we can't schedule on Mondays because that's the day of your group, is there any day of the week that absolutely doesn't work for you."

462.0,Provider,yeah no totally. So good you'll be at least a little bit more well rested there.
17244.0,Patient,"So is there any advice you can give me for trying to fall asleep at night, will the zoloft eventually, allow me to do that."
462.0,Provider,"That would be a good question for your prescriber if they think that that will eventually help, but other than that just you know natural things like no screen time at least an hour before you know. It would be. Good TVs phone reading. Guided sleep meditation there's something called yoga need dry I don't know if you've heard of that it's a."
17244.0,Patient,yeah I do a lot of peloton.
462.0,Provider,"meditation okay perfect yeah so doing those. journaling if you've got anxiety doing just kind of a free writing letting it all out and then trying to you know consciously put it away in a drawer just kind of some of those behavioral techniques. sounds like you're doing a lot of them already, but really just trying to stick to them and create a routine so your body knows hey it's time."
17244.0,Patient,yeah cuz i'm not real good at doing that at night i'll do it in the morning. and love the day but at night i'm. Not real good I need to do better at that.
462.0,Provider,"yeah so trying to create a nighttime routine maybe it's read for 10 minutes throw on a peloton sleep meditation. Or you know journal free right for 10 minutes again close it and say i'm putting this away now and put it aside all those thoughts, you know. kind of metaphorically. And then sleep meditation and every night right then your body knows this is what's happening and just. see if it starts to make a difference."
17244.0,Patient,"Very good, well Jesse Thank you so much you've been really great."
