11668.0,Patient,Good okay okay to be like.
207.0,Provider,"And then the other thing is on now, I see that we have you flag I don't know, let me check your survey not yet yeah you're. showing that. Okay, so you just completed your pH shows your. devices to. Have you been having thoughts of harming yourself."
11668.0,Patient,"No, no, no, the only thing I get is i'm very high strong and I guess I didn't use it and all sorts of different situations social is you're trying to put me on a plane I would I go. i'm just like that, but not terrified of dying. me hitting the wrong button."
207.0,Provider,intake but before I do. see that depression scale yeah.
11668.0,Patient,yeah i'm not even I don't get depressed really I don't. The only thing that worries me is that court crap. that's what i'm worried about now. Perfect perfect perfect but. Getting everything going to change a lot of things it's not like um yeah I don't I like life. more worried about the other part of dying.
207.0,Provider,"So you have a lot of anxiety around dying and I know you said include we here it's more about. What, what is your faith as it's related to court."
11668.0,Patient,"yeah the Court, I get the most exactly about, but even if it wasn't court and group type stuff I kind of know the older, I get the more anxiety I get to situations, I guess."
207.0,Provider,"And what are your thoughts, when you think about like the anxiety, you have around that dying. Right yeah. I know you're. Here you're terrified of time."
11668.0,Patient,"yeah like how am I gonna die is that can be painful what comes after I mean. Logic tells you maybe nothing because. I don't know about all these religions, I hope, there's something else, but who knows. Just you know complete darkness so."
207.0,Provider,So for you it's more. The fear and the anxiety or fear around dying and not knowing if they're really truly life after death.
11668.0,Patient,"yeah like before dying it's I don't want the 10 minute you know plane crashes death or the alligator deaths or anything like that, and then after it's like what comes next."
207.0,Provider,"So what is it that brought about like that that level of anxiety when you really think about um you know, is it that you experienced someone dying, is it that you like you watch a lot of movie you weren't related I mean in movies. yeah always Nice."
11668.0,Patient,yeah it's it's more movies and documentaries and stuff.
207.0,Provider,"Okay, so let's explore the documentary what specific because for documentaries, you have to seek out a documentary and then to sit there and continue watching it on that document, you have to pique your interest."
11668.0,Patient,"yeah and you know it could be a pro a pro religion documentary and you can help me believe that and, at the end of the. documentary that shows the pros of there's no religion it'll have me believing. there's all this, which document i'm watching you know I guess both make good points, but I don't know how I get there is no I just like I used to like watch TV, a lot more. So watch everything for now."
207.0,Provider,"Because what makes me curious is when you think about your and we'll talk about this more on Thursday, when you reflect on your life. yeah where you are today, do you find that it increases your anxiety on how you're going to die, and what what what what happened after you die when you reflect on your life like Is that why you you reflect on or the fear of dying."
11668.0,Patient,Like did I did I waste more or less.
207.0,Provider,yeah well i'm just wondering you're in terms of. Your perspective or point of view.
11668.0,Patient,"yeah. i'm not worrying about answering them done anything to devil to God i'm not worried about that part of religion and like if you don't get another afterwards, am I worried about wasting and not really maybe a couple girls I screwed over that you know what nothing too bad. But it does worry me when I like them 40 and. 30 left 30 or 40 left that kind of worries me once you hit that halfway point."
207.0,Provider,"So you're getting older, the like now that you're getting older, you feel like you haven't given now you're 42 years."
11668.0,Patient,Important to them well yeah.
207.0,Provider,"And so, is it that when you think about your age you're you're reflecting on what have you accomplished, and now you have it sounds like you've done put a number two what's."
11668.0,Patient,That yeah yeah well no wonder how they're gonna die or.
207.0,Provider,No one knows the exit exit. The. unfortunate thing is that you personally don't know your.
11668.0,Patient,"I mean, yes, I was a betting man, I would say, probably 15 to 20 years and a heart. heart."
207.0,Provider,"Then why would you why would you say you have another 1520 years, why would you give yourself that number."
11668.0,Patient,i'm just saying if we're doing I was a betting man I don't.
207.0,Provider,Know okay okay if you're gambling okay.
11668.0,Patient,If I was gambling on what what gets me and me and. Probably that. I would guess.
207.0,Provider,"The average so then to come up with that number, the average lifespan of the men in your family. have lived so this this agent is."
11668.0,Patient,"A little longer, but that's a little harder so."
207.0,Provider,"I took that okay. So now we're talking business so some because you parted or whether you dibble and dabble in things that would have affected you over time. yeah and so now, when I sit and reflect and I think. about the things that i've done and how I have. The possibility of decreasing my lifespan and not necessarily knowing what's going to happen, so it seems like like you said, the exploration with different religions, is there a God, is there not yeah and which one is reeling which one is not. You know I will I go meet him, will I not. So it seems like there is that curiosity and that's what brings about that ultimate fear because hey if there really truly is life after death. What determines what what my face would be if there's a devil, and if there's a God, what will my face me. And my faith is determined. Based on my current life today and based on my current LIFE to be with the reflection of how i'm living or what i'm doing um It makes me fearful. If I died today what's going to happen."
11668.0,Patient,"yeah and I wouldn't even see what i've done because I don't think what i've done is ever been that wrong, maybe America. 21st century America my view it as wrong, but nobody said God Jesus is wrong, you know me doing this trigger that trigger you know i've never raped or or hit me hit guys got a lot of sites with guys that never girl, and you know."
207.0,Provider,"categorize. We also redefine and we categorize what we believe is wrong and we kind of put it on a larger scale so. yeah if i've never harm a child. If I am never killed anybody if i've never robbed or steal that i've done nothing wrong, but the truth of the matter is, if you say hey Michelle can I borrow your pen and you walk off with my my Pen, would you be considered a fee."
11668.0,Patient,yeah I guess it's in. perspective but. i've definitely been going to take I take times left and right.
207.0,Provider,"Yes, so it sounds it sounds that you're at a point in your life, because when you mentioned age. That sounds like you've been doing a lot of reflecting and reevaluation."
11668.0,Patient,"yeah yeah I have and even going back to when I was at you know eight whatever from eight on I can't sleep, because my mind doesn't set off, I would say at night i'm always thinking about crap like that."
207.0,Provider,Did anybody have great significant or important pass away. When you were young was there anything from maddie in reference to someone passing away.
11668.0,Patient,"No, I mean I guess the biggest traumatic thing was when I was a freshman in high school and now I go I got in a fight. And I told my mom was lunch with my lungs that i'll just move with my dad so she called me on my journey to Ohio but anyway, the next summer, she was a drinker."
207.0,Provider,"She got an APP called when you're blocking. To call you out on it and broke up your dad Yes, he."
11668.0,Patient,"dreaming that chevy blazer and drove me eight hours so i'll. In a car in the country, I was used to Chicago so shocking. So, but that wasn't that wasn't the part that. I guess what we what we said."
207.0,Provider,"was true. Dramatic dramatic in your In your opinion, because our product is all based on on us right what is from. So for you what was that."
11668.0,Patient,"It was the next summer I remember my mom is going to join this dog and Alaskan malamute from Chicago to hair and I remember one day pass. and see then color calm and then I. didn't actually killed somebody of vehicular homicide drinking and ended up, I mean maybe doing six seven months in jail, but that was tyrannical I guess."
207.0,Provider,So she she she was under the influence driving.
11668.0,Patient,"Yes, yes."
207.0,Provider,And she took home.
11668.0,Patient,yeah and.
207.0,Provider,"From that point on, you had a lot of fear around. The method of passing away."
11668.0,Patient,"I wouldn't say no, I don't think that had anything to do passing away I don't know I don't know what to."
207.0,Provider,"Do do do do a lot of fear. The farm, it was a lot of fear in in beginning in a car."
11668.0,Patient,"Maybe oh i've always been like that I remember yelling at her making a stop before before that excellent ever i've always been that way in cars so maybe the accident part of it, maybe. it's for on that, like getting in planes and yeah i'm kind of the five miles under type of guy and thinking that somebody hits me right now. over how would it be yeah so yeah maybe."
207.0,Provider,"So let me ask you this, what would your for you, what would your top of."
11668.0,Patient,"Mine it started out on opiates. And then, then it went to really opiates but i've been i've been addicted to alcohol i've been addicted to marijuana i've been addicted to speed show, but I guess lately up until this I got off everything was speed more or less like after our arrows cousin. You know."
207.0,Provider,It all were you when you started any any.
11668.0,Patient,um the what which ones. anything. Anything anything was probably 15 with weed and then obviously alcohol when you're.
207.0,Provider,"15 with we a lot of. A lot of the marijuana smoking, I can definitely see come around with the anxiety."
11668.0,Patient,"or yeah yeah and you know, during the week, and they get screwed up school, you know high right before school definitely has an effect on what you did during the day. yeah I think you'd like to go back and do it all, I definitely wouldn't start messing around with anything until college."
207.0,Provider,"No, but either, but think about what what was going on what was a great significance in your life when it was the marijuana. was given to you what."
11668.0,Patient,"It was before I moved away and all that, I think that it was more who I was hanging around with. And I think but i've always seen my mom doing she's a drinker and now they look like smoking weed so."
207.0,Provider,So your mom was a drink or smoke or going on.
11668.0,Patient,"yeah yeah but the great mom would always you know easier for us take us to the basketball and sports all Curry mom I got my mama's boy, and I think losing her would be more traumatic than what happened. So that kind of worries me."
207.0,Provider,"Then, would you say that a lot of your your your journey in addiction eat outside of. You know the people who you're hanging out with would you say it was a learned behavior because it was what the kids you were hanging around with there was nothing of me, there was no major difference between what they were doing and what you were living in."
11668.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
207.0,Provider,It was your norm.
11668.0,Patient,"Would you say that it was my norm yeah yeah and even my other my other. side of the family to they were drinkers and. And my dad smoker. I know I mean it didn't have. Again, a great dad and he wasn't nobody ever beat me or hit me along did a couple times, through a spoon at me or try to backhand me but I deserve that. You know."
207.0,Provider,Nothing about just reflecting back on your your your assessment when we did it your grandmother was a drinker as well.
11668.0,Patient,Oh yeah the one the one grandma was it turned into diabetic and definitely. Probably cost her like Kenya so it's a.
207.0,Provider,"Little. So addiction was a common theme within your family and what you grew up grew up around for your normal what. Your normal was. Within that life of addiction. yeah so so even the friends you associated with. met, it was all in line with what was normal Thank you. You said you didn't realize it until one."
11668.0,Patient,"I didn't realize that the younger ages, that you know that's what was affecting me or you know you have no clue at that age what shrinking or. How it affects them, are you but looking back yeah."
207.0,Provider,"So coping was there was no real. teeth, no one taught you, you know when. Excuse me when you're feeling anxious and when you're feeling sad or heightened anxiety or anything like that no one, you would say, would it be accurate when, not to say that no one really taught you um. Any other way of dealing with trauma or depression or anything like that you. know the norm within your family was. Everyone who's drinking smoking that's just kind of how they did their thing it was hard time."
11668.0,Patient,"Exactly, I think, maybe if that happened in 2015 verses 1985, I think, maybe you know it has been explained a little better. I think."
207.0,Provider,"I don't wouldn't have been explained, if you're if you're if you're a base you're basing your home it doesn't matter what point whether it was in the 70s 80s and 90s, or even now. If you're based in within your home, this is your normal, and this is everybody in the House is doing it gets was abnormal. meeting is next door. was doing something different i'm the one that strange, how is it not your family doesn't do that my that my family says this party all day long into how we have fun so i'm just looking."
11668.0,Patient,"Everything was the same yeah. I guess, I was. Thinking like because it's so i'm like you have what you're where you're working now I don't think there's ever a place like that and 85 was."
207.0,Provider,"Of course, there was. It was it now mental health and addiction was always around mental illness has always been around. It was a little it's a little bit more employees today. yeah more. You know. based more accepted and it's. A day it's more talked about today, back then, it was a little bit more taboo, what are you talking about it. With drugs and alcohol it doesn't mean that children weren't doing it or people weren't exposed but, at the end of the day, keep in mind if you're 42 and you grew up around it your mom has her own battles with addiction. Your grandmother, so you go back to your grandmother the year, she was born in it, she was exposed so it's always been around it's just that, as the world changes or as we get into it's become more something people are being a little bit more open to talk about it now, and so. He would you say that you were able to identify hey something is wrong and I need help, because this is not fun anymore, this is not cool and this is not normal."
11668.0,Patient,With me taking your stuff like when was it affecting me.
207.0,Provider,"At what age, did you recognize. Can you hear me. I don't know if you can hear me. I think it's disconnected I just tried calling his number and it went straight to voicemail i'm going to go ahead and end the session and i'll message him on to remind them of his next appointment, thank you."
