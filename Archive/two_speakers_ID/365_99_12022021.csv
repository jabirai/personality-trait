99.0,Provider,i'm doing good how's it going.
365.0,Patient,just getting situated.
99.0,Provider,Oh good that's better.
365.0,Patient,How was your day.
99.0,Provider,"My gosh so full I was actually thinking of just a little earlier today, and just thinking I don't have children, and I am my I am so fried and I can't imagine. What it's like to you know, for her to be working all day and and have JESSICA there at the end of the day, and however it is and to be able to show up for filming because i'm just like cross eyed and sizzling the."
365.0,Patient,"Sometimes, because you get so stressed out with her. She gets simon's like hyper and she has she wants to pay attention and all that so just sitting there mom mom mom oh yeah mom this is. Trying to do something outsider Johnson to turn around look what she's doing."
99.0,Provider,yeah yeah I think I see justice she next to you. Oh good hi.
365.0,Patient,roxanne I change my contacts. know are really watery how are you.
99.0,Provider,i'm i'm okay i'm good i'm just breathing deep and just beating the China do what I invite you all to do when like it's so crazy yeah.
365.0,Patient,it's been a crazy crazy week.
99.0,Provider,"yeah already it's only Wednesday, I know. So yeah so um. In the session I had with matt we were just talking about a lot of things and it seemed like Oh, this could be a good good good time to do some family sessions with you and with Jessica and just touch in and and make the time and space for that yeah."
365.0,Patient,"Next week. Okay. We should do is sit there with an agenda is real and I can understand why she's reluctant for counseling because of everything, and all the accounting that we have to go through, and she just you mentioned counseling and she just clams up and far. we're getting a little bit better but it's very slow progress."
99.0,Provider,Whether. What is better in your experience or opinion.
365.0,Patient,"Giving her time i'm telling her to go have her space and I have my space, but when I do, that I feel like a lot of guilt. Because. she thinks I don't want her around me so when I tell you need to take time for you, because I need time for me and I need alone time she she gets really sad like feels rejected. And At first it was working because that's something we took some counseling that we were doing with the therapist will see you Wednesday and once she got home she like. cut it and said I don't want nothing to do with that anymore I don't want nothing to be related to see why he. And I try to use some of the tools, I. learned, but a lot of them, she just kind of rejected, and the one that I kept was I need my time I need space, because I don't say something to i'll regret I don't want to yell I don't. want to elevate my anger so bad for frustration so bad that I hurt her feelings yeah so um and then, once she does that it, it does help once we do separate it does help cousin. So come to the room with her little notepad. You know, and things like yes she's like i'm under the door shall come and shut the door. Under the door. Like. just saying. i'm sorry and that's one thing I really we really try to make her understand doesn't always have to say, sorry I don't know. If she said sorry so much to market or debt, but here when I hear her say that all the time it breaks my heart because it's like you don't have to always say sorry. You could just say ups, you know even ups would be great or oh no anything but I mean it could be something as simple as she. knocked over the little ball and oh my God i'm sorry i'm sorry and it's like we're trying to really get her out of that because it's not it's sorry. For her it's it seems like it's this is this isn't way too much, and so you know we try to teach her different ways of saying you know oh next time now, I know, next time i'll do it this way or next time I won't say that you know, so we try to practice that back and forth with her."
99.0,Provider,"or there's one that just came to my mind, that that I just thought of oh my God, I did it again and I still love myself or something you know, because it seems to go back to some sort of like oh my God, am I lovable you know."
365.0,Patient,"Have that yeah exactly and it makes me feel like so bad, sometimes even get tears in my eyes oh my God like. rob you know you don't have to always say sorry and she's like I know i'm sorry that's like oh."
99.0,Provider,"yeah we may be talking about this next week, if you bring it up, if we can really think about some new strategies for her. I like."
365.0,Patient,"She said I did it again, I still love myself as a virtue so."
99.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
365.0,Patient,"I like that one too because loving herself as another thing she's she's doing a lot better. A lot she had a really low self esteem like she had to look a certain way or be a certain way or be up to the trend, you know, and I know how the trend with kids is now you know you have to have what they have and. what's in and what's not you know and she's getting a lot better because she is she is got a little bit of meat on her too, and that was one thing we struggled with, but now. she's realizing that people do appreciate her just for her you know the personality perfumer you know her compassion and all that stuff so that's getting a lot better like a lot better and the bullying she's able to say you know what you don't like me it's okay."
99.0,Provider,that's an area that seems like some shifting going on.
365.0,Patient,"And also, she doing a lot better there it's just I think my frustration is just I have a lot of stress so. i'm I don't know how to channel it out in the right ways anymore like I tangled myself again so when I get frustrated with her my go to is give me some space, you know I need me I need time for me just to. decompress I don't know, maybe just silence, you know, whatever it is, and."
99.0,Provider,"I have an idea. JESSICA, since you said you'd like tangled yourself up again and it sounds like maybe you're in a stuck place with it, is that accurate. yeah. I heard from. Oh. let's just let's um let's just give some space for you feeling yeah. Just let them come through maybe this is what needs to happen, right now, just. Recognizing trying you're doing you're doing your best with you know the tools, you have so far. it's time to kind of stretch into the new growth and it's hard. huh. what's what is coming up for you. yeah."
365.0,Patient,again.
99.0,Provider,What does that routine look like.
365.0,Patient,"get up go to work do everything for work, and then they come home. And I try to remember what I have to do here what I just I do. let's quickly easy, so I can go to bed."
99.0,Provider,and on a scale of one to 10 one being hardly at all 10 being completely how satisfying is the routine.
365.0,Patient,Not at all.
99.0,Provider,Not at all so it's a really low so yeah this is.
365.0,Patient,i'm.
99.0,Provider,Imagining there's some.
365.0,Patient,"I like i'm letting. This week has been really, really bad. But i'm learning. Everything at work walk all over me and i'm trying to satisfy everybody there, no matter how much pain i'm in that matter how hungry, I am no matter how busy I am i'm just going and i'm just saying yes to everything, and I know that. I know the tenants will stop me and i'm trying to go get something to eat, and I just Okay, and it turned right back around and. hmm i'm just letting it walk all over me and I. i'm not getting. What I would want like with my higher up bosses, I would like them to recognize it. or even just come out and just see the difference, or the changes i've made and it's just not happening and i'm. I know it's happening, but I keep doing it. And then I come home and then like I have my time with Jennifer she's with me for a couple hours at work or a few hours at work, and she we interact with our time there and sometimes we we bond talk or whatever, so I managed to fill that in there, but when I get home. i'm just. yeah like flatline click i'm done and i'm gonna say, the only thing I have to say is about work, so I don't want to talk about it, no more because that's all I ever talked about."
99.0,Provider,"So jess what how old is this part of you, that is basically doing her best to please everyone else."
365.0,Patient,Like 30 years old. Like we've been doing it for about that long.
99.0,Provider,"I oh so. what's so go back to maybe very early like how old, are you know 4141 so maybe if she's 30 years old she's maybe like nine. yeah let's just be her for a moment. Because it sounds like she's showing up. For some reason. What was it like in your home when you were nine. House so."
365.0,Patient,"my brother was gone is in jail all the time, fighting with my mom. My other brother left us and what was his dad and so just need my mom."
99.0,Provider,"So imagine this nine year old you probably wanted to be the good little girl so that she could you know, bring something to the House as well as get the love she really needed. That is that accurate during my."
365.0,Patient,"was very, very close to my mom. I didn't leave her side. I felt like everybody left her so I wanted to be there for her yeah."
99.0,Provider,"Yes, there's a real deep loyalty and."
365.0,Patient,"By the way, necessary messes with much."
99.0,Provider,what's that man.
365.0,Patient,said it's plain white messes with her so so much as my details JESSICA she needs a minute.
99.0,Provider,"uh huh, why do you think that that messes with her so much."
365.0,Patient,She was with her mom and she didn't want to leave her side and.
99.0,Provider,"got it uh huh. Is that does that happen, sometimes just that you see yourself in Jericho wanting to be near you so much."
365.0,Patient,"it's total opposite. I know I can't make it happen, but. as close as I was with my mom I feel her like and it's my mom you know. Sometimes it is overwhelming like that, because the things that she wants to push on to me, I have no clue I think it's so new these days like I don't get it, but I tried to and sometimes it's it gets frustrating because i'm like oh my God it's just it's like. about this friend that friend and I don't know how to. digest it, you know."
99.0,Provider,"You don't it sounds like you don't have the bandwidth to let in which she sharing because it's you're so full on from work that there's not much left. yeah yeah. Okay let's go back to this nine year old that had a lot going on at home, you know brothers in jail and just a lot of. challenge and probably pain in the home and and so you know you were doing things to please others yeah is that."
365.0,Patient,My mom just want.
99.0,Provider,to please your mom yeah.
365.0,Patient,yeah stay that way till. I was 26.
99.0,Provider,"And let's let's understand the function of that what was the function of doing, you know as much as he could to please her what it What purpose does that serve."
365.0,Patient,"The way that she was with me. I was pretty much her everything, because my brothers were gone, they were one was in jail all the time and. My other brother was with his dad, so I think she took my brother going with his dad as like a betrayal. So she latched on to me, and of course I latched on to her, and I just. I just always wanted her know that I wouldn't leave."
99.0,Provider,"Okay, some of that function was connection and security yeah. mm hmm maybe security should we go with that one. let's see they're going because. Truly. i'm wondering if there's a parallel with what's going on at work right now that there might be some overextending because there's a very human need for security with your job. Could that be some of it."
365.0,Patient,"I care about those people sometimes I feel like I care about them too much. bunch of different. Diverse tenants but. Like the for my main office is is they're elderly, and I think I latch on to them, because I don't have my mom no more so. You know I tried to advocate for them and I. uh huh and you see that if their pain, or if they're lonely most lonely. gentle don't really have any family, and let me as like you said there's a couple couple of ladies there that. Are I feel the guilt that or family has broken all over the place of she don't have grandparents. uncles rocky's really she does but they're not in our life so a couple of the residents. One in particular has her agenda bonded and built a relationship. And every time that lady calls, I will answer my phone and if I don't answer my phone I feel guilty um I could be on my vacation or days off or holiday, and I still answer it and Jessica is like ours grandma she calls her grandma you know. And so it's just. it's it's that. yeah security and that loyalty and. And again, I don't have my moms and I see these people as my mom at this point, you know my mom would be in her 60s, I see them in her or her in them, I mean, and I think that's why I just want to say I don't want that fuse to burn out, you know about my mom."
99.0,Provider,"yeah gosh another very strong need that i'm picking up on correct me if i'm wrong is you know, is the need for whatever you want to call it family tribe Community any of this, you know that sounds like it's been very fractured in your family system family of origin systems so."
365.0,Patient,"On like right now JESSICA has a project at school, to find out where your ancestors, a problem and she's supposed to interview a family member. To find out what country they come from and man, I had to finally break down an email her teacher and say we don't have our given, we have our chosen family. And I felt bad because i'm sure all these other I don't know other kids situations, but i'm sure that they probably have aunties and uncles he might be able to interview or grandparents. And Jennifer doesn't have that, and now I that stressed me out like so bad because felt that you know, like she has nobody to interview. A logical family to actually sit there and do an interview with."
99.0,Provider,What would it be like you guys to sit down with Jessica and show her your pain around this and and really share with her the reality of it.
365.0,Patient,"It would take a lot more clean. because she wishes, she just wouldn't get why that's her main question like why you know why, and a lot I don't I guess the fear is bringing up the whole cyp situation to her again, you know it was something so. painful to her she's literally expressed it, I don't want to deal with the cyp anymore, she gets it she gets angry lecture she'll talk to me. And she she's a lot like matt was that, like she just clams up and shuts down and you got to give her time she feels like she's ready to say. Maybe you're lucky if you get a couple of sentences out of her, but you know, for her when she's ready she's asked to be on her time and that's fine i've understood that and i'm able to deal with that, but. it's just a fear of saying hey you know we've we've kind of told her you know there's a lot of pain around it, you know a lot, I think, come. In. late September like right at the last is September. Oh debt called. out of the blue, I had erased her number out of my phone and I thought ISIS number keep calling me like it, it was bugging me I haven't answered yet, because I didn't have it saved in my phone. And we were shopping for a birthday presents for Jessica and i'm wearing said walmart and I panicked I answered the phone. And I panicked I shoved matt away and I told Jennifer to set up and I was just like I didn't know what to do, like I I faked the whole conversation and. it's like she felt she was being watched take the news I did I felt like they were like right behind me and I told matt like go hey you know stop walking. yeah it really mess with me so there's a whole lot of pain that hasn't been dealt with, because I didn't know."
99.0,Provider,A lot of trauma actually.
365.0,Patient,"yeah I didn't know, I was going to react I didn't know how to react that way, I really did it and afterwards I was just like we got to go like I couldn't do I. couldn't continue the happy moments were having shopping and looking for stuff for jenna could have do we do her bathroom and stuff and it just everything shut down in me every."
99.0,Provider,Have you tried blocking those are that's number.
365.0,Patient,"I do, I enjoy. Doing that I don't know why I didn't do it first um but I didn't know because I don't want. yeah I don't I can't handle it, I personally cannot handle it that's one thing that just hit me dead in my chest, and I froze yes."
99.0,Provider,"And you don't have to handle her anymore, she she don't really owe her anything I think definitely though working through some of this because it. That is a trauma response, I mean you're you went offline your frontal lobe wasn't online anymore it went into a fight or flight real primitive response."
365.0,Patient,"And she goes like who's that who's that and, of course, oh yeah oh JESSICA I didn't know what to do, I said yeah you could tell her I. and Jessica felt a little awkward I could tell someone responses, you know her main concern was how was ruben the little boy that they adopted that she was living with. And that was the main important to us, I want to talk to ruben and reuben isn't isn't innocent kid has nothing to do with this whole entire situation, so I didn't mind that but. it's so conflicting because I don't want nothing to do with mark no debt and then there's an innocent boy rubin and i've got to keep my daughter away from him, you know and because they're connected to mark no debt. Granted Jennifer has made tons of friends now at school, you know so that's not in her mind anymore as much, but I felt all this guilt and I felt I was just I was a mess like I did I came home, and I was just zoned out. For the rest of them. And even and you know Janet Janet was talking to or that I have this like anger and this. I don't know what feel like somebody was sitting on my chest, and I was like oh my God that's my kid get off the phone. You know what I even have to tell JESSICA like it's done, you know your conversations done I didn't know what else to do."
99.0,Provider,"um. Is this the. First time you've ever felt this way. i'm sorry, is this the first not maybe not this instance, but just this kind of reaction with a debt is this the first time you've ever had this strong of a brief reaction to anyone."
365.0,Patient,"yeah this this was. I felt so many emotions I I felt in towards her, of course, during the whole situation, but it was a lot of anger and frustration with her at this point my child home with me, as well as the family and then this person invaded. hotel, I felt anger, I felt confusion, I felt guilt. Everything but anything positive. National not away and I felt guilty, because I was, I felt like I was telling my kid like. No, no, no, and me, I was being paid and."
99.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
365.0,Patient,Many things.
99.0,Provider,yeah.
365.0,Patient,"Too many days to do that, once in I just I had I don't know white and black and before, but I didn't know what I don't put a pastor to try to find me. Another way to try to have somebody else call me as a matter of fact, she did she had somebody call me that wasn't housing telling me that oh dad gave her my numbers like I tried to help her with her housing problems. And I said i'm sorry I don't deal in that department, you know i'll connect you with so and so and I did I said here call this person. So I don't put a pastor she to keep trying, you know. I don't."
99.0,Provider,"explicitly told her debt tonight call you all anymore. uh huh Okay, so this is definitely there's no shaming in this there's just something i'm noticing is some some work is on boundaries boundaries, with the people that are very scary to the people that you love so much you know. And how to how to do this in a way that you can you can."
365.0,Patient,"I if I said that. She will come after me. vindictive way just. I feel that she would come after me some way, somehow, so I feel like I have to be polite."
99.0,Provider,Your channel.
365.0,Patient,yeah.
99.0,Provider,you're doing your best to protect your family. yeah.
365.0,Patient,"I have a zero trust for her. yeah or my cousin and that's another thing couple weeks ago my cousin's daughter text me and I don't know why all these. Past things are coming out me but I don't want to deal with them, I don't want to allow these people in my life and I thought i'm doing good thing nope you know, like i'm not going to ask you another talk to you i'm going to whatever you know and. there's this little fears that just hovers right over me. Between odette and mark and my cousin Bernadette."
99.0,Provider,"Oh let's take a few deep breaths it sounds like gosh there's a lot of fear and then overwhelmed with work. And so many feelings with JESSICA. is bringing some. Some oxygen in. yeah it's a lot. yeah really focus on that exhale chest. Just lengthening the exhalation. Yes, good just get it out it's a safe place to get it out. And just if you can really focus on this loving hand that is making contact with you. The support in your life. See how much you can let in and that loving touch."
365.0,Patient,"there's too many things going on in my head. As to use word used to use work as an outlet. And now it's what's causing. It causes it, but at the same time, their course of the global market will get Bernadette many things i'm thinking about these people and even as terrorism, a stress exam it just it's a whole nother road from me, so I just zone out there, but then. You get home and i'm like oh man iron all these type of rain, like all these drops of stuff are just falling on me i'm a lot to do with them."
99.0,Provider,"Is you know jess it sounds to me, I mean work can become an addiction for sure, and it sounds a little bit like this has become a way to distract and not feel the the complexity of what's actually happening at home and."
365.0,Patient,"yeah I think he would need to do to take care of. The household but I disconnect from my relationship I disconnect from. The things that I have to put boundaries on or try to deal with just to get. You know, to sift out believes, or whatever and. it's like. When I noticed now. When I get fear something. Now i'm the word shutting down."
99.0,Provider,"I was wondering actually because I have, I have really noticed some changes in matt you know, over the last couple years and his capacity to identify feelings and speak them wondering how What did you experience."
365.0,Patient,"We don't talk. much about the way we used to because I just I know i'm not saying to me, but I know that for myself i've. i've done a little bit of a shift for. I just shut down, then I started shutting more down about work because I said damn i'm all i'm doing is bitching and complaining about it and that's all came out so maybe i'm not I shouldn't talk about that, and then I tried. Not staying long hours and work i'm. doing better at that because. i'm feeling the stress of work so that's kind of a negative but it's positive because i'm saying you know what i'm done at this time i'm not gonna sit here and i'm not estate extra hour an hour and a half, like I have done. So I do need sometimes they will leave early because I want to come home I want my family to be together. But. i'm and i'm like zoned out. I don't know what to talk about I don't know my interests or his interests anymore or. Trying to do a little bit of reconnecting rice say okay let's sit down and watch the movie you know. And we've done that, a few times, but I don't think we're not communicating anymore."
99.0,Provider,So it sounds like some important work could be reconnecting with each other.
365.0,Patient,"I thought I was trying but. I mean, I do recognize a I have shut down. And I don't know if it's just overwhelming thoughts in my mind, and my fears I don't I you know what's that saying, if you don't talk about him it ain't about. It I don't know how exactly goes, but I in my head like I don't say them out loud and it's not a fear, so I could just store it away over here, I feel like you're trying to get all my slow. gentle gentle everything and I that's my thought if I don't talk and say them out loud and it's not an issue and it's Okay, not to worry about that i've told you about brand restricts on. I told you about Bernadette and I told you like get angry mean it pissed me off, and it made me start going into all these different things, what is she doing is she trying to see here's something from the family. issue trying to fish for something so I was making myself crazy, so I just deleted that text messages and I just. Totally. And I don't want to keep talking about it because I was if I did, I know what I would do. yeah."
99.0,Provider,So okay so so you've named it there's a part of you that has shut down a bit to sharing and connection and.
365.0,Patient,"Just you know. I do. I have to shut myself down said don't keep doing that. that's one thing that would drive me nuts, is that I will not stop thinking so I didn't stop thinking i'm never that's something part that's a part of me that I have, and I do it with selectively."
99.0,Provider,You just stop sharing about it.
365.0,Patient,"yeah because I felt like it was driving it wasn't it was like God, yes, you know you it drives me crazy to see like that or to hear that or whatever, so I know select selectively pick the things that I think I need to do that with I just don't know when you're like that. i'll be on your desktop or stressed out with it, this is this isn't you this whole new thing with the me trying to figure out. is a better way to say it is, I took part, how to say that departmental eyes. i'm picking and choosing what do I need to stress, about what do I need to express or get upset about it so and. I think i'm trying to take in consideration that if it's something to do with him i'm just. You know if we've talked about it he's told me how you felt when I say something about it so. It upsets you, and it can turn into something bigger, so I just Okay, if I might know the answer to it i'm not going to talk about it. If it's something that I think damn just it's one of those little things again it's not worth it it's not necessary um the bigger stresses like we just talked about. I Those are my fears, so I don't want to prefer them. Well, I do put them in a little compartment and put them away."
99.0,Provider,"And it's not necessarily addressing it it's just getting it's adding more to your plate, so what i'm hearing to matt correct me if i'm wrong is that it's not that you don't want to hear what Jeff has to say it's you don't know what to do with it."
365.0,Patient,Without. These missing your are not truly my fingers the universe.
99.0,Provider,It wait what leaves you sitting there twiddling your fingers with.
365.0,Patient,"Her not saying nothing. pissed off or she's in her own mind or it stressed out and she's just doesn't stay in the things that makes me feel like. Either she just doesn't want to talk to me about it or doesn't want to talk period about it, or just. I don't know just fed up with me I don't know if that's the way I start going off."
99.0,Provider,"So it's not really helpful for her to be holding things in either. I haven't you guys. here's an experiment i've actually been doing it with my partner lately so i'm going to just offer a. couples some couples work so you've set a timer on your phone for however long you all think you have the bandwidth to hold space for the other. Five minutes 10 minutes eight minutes, whatever three minutes and you set the timer and each of you gets that amount of time to share what's going on physically. what's going on emotionally and what's going on mentally and you go through those things, and the other person doesn't have to. do anything they're just listening and witnessing so that you know you're so you there's some connection and understanding of what's going on for the other but there's no needing to fix it or really respond unless you want to get into dialogue."
365.0,Patient,So we don't have to make it a discussion we've just sharing.
99.0,Provider,"yeah and maybe there can be an agreement like you know Okay, because something i've noticed is when my partner shares, I hear things that are hard for him and I want to talk about it. So then i'll ask hey are you open to talking about this, maybe like an hour later or something or i'll say Oh, I will ask i'll ask for his consent, you know, are you open to this and if he says no i've got to just accept it, but at least I know what's going on, you know. What do y'all think about giving that a try."
365.0,Patient,i'm not i'm not opposed to it.
99.0,Provider,"Because it sounds like math a little bit in the dark, at this point he just doesn't know because shane and you don't."
365.0,Patient,"I just feel like my complaints are not not valid, but. it's usually I don't know what to do with the fears that I have because I don't think i've ever dealt with such a massive fear and the way. These people made me feel the trust that i've lost the trust was broken. The anger, I feel towards certain people I mean. matt has shared with me and I appreciate the honesty of saying hey I know I was at circle K right, so my dad or ran into my dad and. holy crap the overwhelming feeling of this anger that I have and and I he sees it in me and he's like I didn't you know do it, and I appreciate that but in i'm not faulting in front of. me personally, and this anger, I feel towards that his mom his dad his sister's my cousins um with my two cousins and these people if I saw them I don't know what I do, I really don't so it's just overwhelming anger and I never felt. With even my past and the things i've been through I have gotten over that yes, there were many years ago, but this has been. Probably 10 full what I felt towards my past issues. And I don't know what to do, I feel like guilty, for having this anger and. This fear I feel like a. I used to think of myself as a strong person that I have strength to overcome this and overcome that and look at my past, and I was proud of that, and then there's this and it can't get past it can't go past the fear it can get past the anger. long time."
99.0,Provider,"yeah you're you're still recovering and that anger just is because many boundaries have been crossed. So I just want to validate it and not minimize you know. And the fear is around you know what has been taken, what could be lost, I mean they're very valid few aliens."
365.0,Patient,"it's it's it's a lot. reached out to my old counselor because I i'm building just so much, and I, I do i'm glad I can recognize it when they fill it, even though sometimes it push it a little too far, but. The anger is like. It has so many different categories, it has to do with my daughter my family my relationship my life my lifestyle my everything it's affected every part of my life, you know it has interfered with my relationship with my daughter, it has interfered with my entire. Three some of my family, it is your my relationship with matt it's done so much you know cause so many feelings or sometimes. I don't trust her, I have a debt first I didn't I was scared like oh my gosh is going to secretly call them, you know that's a really shitty feeling to have about your kid. You know, when you love this little person so so much and you're wondering what do you betray me. i'm thinking i'm looking at crazy person, so this one that's going to veer off that way because i'm losing my gardening mind."
99.0,Provider,"Well, I, I am going to invite you all, if you can make that time I mean, even if you take 12 minutes five minutes for one to share two minutes to just. Silence maybe in five minutes for the other, to share just to stay connected and and kind of up with what's going on for the other person and it's it's pretty simple body physical, emotional and mental just checking in and it helps to check in with yourself to."
365.0,Patient,"them I wouldn't even know where to start I. mean if we wouldn't do that, like right now I wouldn't know where to start and I don't think about stuff that you do on any price me nuts, because I see, and I just. I know you don't and that's that's the hard part about us almost being complete opposite, but we have a lot in common, but a lot of opposites when it comes to emotions and feelings. Then I don't know if that party went to how used to shut down with me that I. was like. I took that on from you know. And I felt like okay well he's like this easygoing person doesn't come to our all these things that I do are worried about all the things that I do so. Maybe if I just held it in as matt has done in the past and said he's done um maybe we'll we'll be able to write it out together and not working."

99.0,Provider,yeah.
365.0,Patient,"But she said. This week she's been going day by day, oh i'm not coming in today jess i'm not coming today. But she accidentally CC me an email telling her supervisor I need to be out to the six i'm like why don't you tell me I don't. put me on a whim like that, and then I have all this chaos to deal with and you're telling me all I couldn't come in, because the kids aren't you know they don't have daycare or whatever so and that's another tactic we'll talk about next week, I think, maybe. The whole will turn on my boss has been to she's fostering her grandkids right now. And I honestly think, and I think I talked to I talked to matt about it that I feel like those fill her going through that and me being supported to her i'm i'm being a little extra supportive because i'm sympathetic for what her son is went through. But it's triggering a lot of things for me. yeah a part of me is like I want to tell her like I know I was there, but I can't. Show you sergeant or boss any people the whole time she went yeah nobody knew nothing I held it together the whole time, but now seeing her go through it and i'm trying to be supportive, I think that has caused a lot of this."
99.0,Provider,"To get resurrected jess i'm going to invite you, and in the next five days until we meet again to journal. get some of this out in your journal write about it, you know, even if you give yourself 10 minutes at night, this isn't a huge thing 10 minutes 12 minutes to devote to each other and 10 minutes to yourself to just write and let some other stuff out."
