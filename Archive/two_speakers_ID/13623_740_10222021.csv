13623.0,Patient,"it's been going OK. I was talking to. Sharon and she was. Like, I guess, we were talking a little bit about like my issues with weight and stuff and. She was like kind of insinuating that I have like an eating disorder and like I don't necessarily and then, of course, like I go to Google and start looking up all this stuff but I don't know like necessarily that's like what's going on."
740.0,Provider,"what's wrong with your weight, what are you doing."
13623.0,Patient,"um I used to have a problem with it like when I was younger I feel like it's kind of started with my dad would always like make like would always pick up, let me kind of me and my brother or whatever, and say that we needed to like get back in shape or whatever, but um. I don't know and then and i've always had kind of an issue with just like wait growing up, but. Lately, I just I don't know. I like i've been I had to hide my scale, because every time I step on it like before I started this gym thing. i'm like every time I saw a number that i'd never seen before I would get really depressed I wouldn't want to do anything i'll just kind of want to sit in the corner and just not be. I don't know it's not it's definitely not like how it was before, though."
740.0,Provider,Like What did you tell her to my. curse take. That you're struggling with the eating disorder.
13623.0,Patient,"um. Well, like when I was younger, I would like like not eat for a little while or like I would throw up sometimes i'm. Saying i'm sorry. I don't know sometimes like if i'm I don't know like counting my calories to kind of be more like health conscious, I guess, and like. Like sometimes if i'm like over I just clicked on it, or something or like if i'll go to the gym like sometimes i'll like do too much or i'll stay there, like until I feel like sick or something. But I don't know I feel like it's definitely been a little bit better since I last spoke to her."
740.0,Provider,"Okay, oh basically. You go to the gym and you overwork yourself. I mean counting calories is normal that's not really a sign of eating disorder, I mean. You know my fitness Pal they can't your calories please. I mean. Everybody loses weight differently, however. Of course, the working out until you speak overworking yourself with my healthy. Now there is there is there can be assigned which may which can make her suspicious. they're not eating for how long how long was the longest time you you basically fast."
13623.0,Patient,"um I don't have like a specific time, I guess, but like i'll just like kind of cut myself off wants to I get to a certain point, so I guess that falls back in mind with the calorie counting."
740.0,Provider,"Okay, for you good good point I mean what time do you catch that ball."
13623.0,Patient,"um I usually stretch it throughout the day. Between like um. I don't know like I try to make sure I stay, to a certain amount for like breakfast lunch and dinner, and like if breakfasts and lunches too much then i'll have like a smaller dinner, I guess, if that makes sense, but. there's not like a time where I cut myself off I guess."
740.0,Provider,"What, what is your total calorie count."
13623.0,Patient,Like 1000 sometimes it's 1200.
740.0,Provider,"What you're either way to see. First off. Okay well. You. I can see why I can see why she would save it. Who told you to give yourself that number is that just a number that you just came away, is that a number that a physician debut I mean, who told you to have who told you just to eat 1000 calories a day."
13623.0,Patient,"um I just I don't know I kind of Google did like to try to like lose weight, a little bit faster. And then, to try to like burn more calories than I eat."
740.0,Provider,"Google I have you have and then he would about OK so. Maybe you should go to actual nutritionist. Because what happened with well i'm not a nutritionist i'm not even though i'm not even on put that out there, but. Sometimes I just say this sometimes we feel like Oh well, if I eat live then move faster but that's not accurate. Just fyi. That accurate so maybe you should go to an actual nutritionist. Because if. If your. weight consciousness is slowly sneaking back up on you, then, if even if you eat like that and you're not losing the way that the pace that you want, then your tech expensive measures, which means he can tell you over the edge, so the best thing to do. is to get it is to go through nutritious because i'm telling you what you're doing you still want to play fast. that's all i'm gonna say i'm not gonna say anything else because I don't want to overstep my bounds but. You need to go to the Sunday before I get off of Google. Leave Google alone okay. When I was bringing it out, I got on Google for some kind of sense and that I had honey and leave it up to them, I was having a field birth all right so get out get out for Google and actually make an appointment to a nutritionist book. how's everything going."
13623.0,Patient,"pretty good. there's been a little bit stressed about. This the job situation because i'm not trying to take any more school loans out and it's just. it's just a little starting to become a little more stressful more real because it's like I don't know i'm almost like out of money, I feel like and finding jobs out here is not that easy, but I don't know."
740.0,Provider,where you are from.
13623.0,Patient,Originally i'm from oakland. California.
740.0,Provider,"Are you feel thing which are mortgage. So. What will we won't get on me yet, but what are your options for like job, but what are you actually looking for."
13623.0,Patient,"i'm trying to find something that's like not just minimum wage, because I feel like i'm at a point where like I shouldn't like just accept the bare minimum anymore. And like. I want to kind of stray away from babysitting just because it's not, I want to do something that's like more in line with what I want to do once I gradually."
740.0,Provider,So I can.
13623.0,Patient,"start making those steps forward, but um. yeah I don't know just like i'm having trouble like I guess finding the right thing."
740.0,Provider,Or what are the things that you're willing to do.
13623.0,Patient,"i'm willing to do caregiving again. Because, at least, I was kind of in a hospital setting and it was pretty good money. But I have to finish getting vaccinated first so it's not really an option."
740.0,Provider,"So, when you say that you're running out of money, like know what you don't have any money to help you financially."
13623.0,Patient,"um I have my dad well I just I don't like asking him for money, I like to like be more independent and it's not like you're like I don't know, do you want like he'll definitely like helped me out if I needed it, but I just i'd rather not even go back to that. um I feel like i'm taking a step backwards and like adulthood."
740.0,Provider,"I really. I mean listen. I mean every lot of me here all right, everybody, I mean everybody needs have it has nothing to do. With a year and adult or not i've had adults to ask me for money. I, as an adult has went back, and so my mama mama I mean this is you, before I mean it doesn't mean that you're retracting you i'm saying, if anything, you just say hey can I have alone, a you know what I get a job, are you the best for you. you're very likely that you know you have to change your perspective in that way, because you don't want to be struggling and you don't want to be struggling and broke. and basically pushers put yourself in such a major hardship, just because you don't want to, or you feel like you've taken a step back."
13623.0,Patient,that's true.
740.0,Provider,"So just get a loan from the father, if you want, if you're if you feel yourself getting. low enough to the point where you know. They have I haven't found a job, yet, but my finest have a very low, you know, let me just you know talk to my day, and if you make you feel better just just say hey can I borrow, which means that you have the intention to pave it. All right, alright not have the better half of the part. You a new boyfriend how's that been in a month into day."
13623.0,Patient,"um. it's been all right. I know it's like supposed to go and visit my dad and my brother like a few weeks ago, for his birthday, but i'm like kind of doing what like this, this like overdue like. electricity bill from when the fridge one out I guess it was drying out a lot today, electricity and like there's a whole bunch stacked on. And so, like I don't know kind of had to cancel like this fun Halloween thing I don't know why it kind of like made me really upset but, like, I was like way more upset than like I needed to be. My because my friends are going on this cruise for Halloween and it's like I couldn't even go on the first trip to out just to see my dad for a few days so. I definitely couldn't go for Halloween and then pay for all this other stuff and then it just started to kind of dawned on me that. Like you know I guess just things aren't really that great year we don't really do too much just stay in the House and, like I don't know it's just starting to where i'm like just were on everything."
740.0,Provider,What do you mean well and everything.
13623.0,Patient,Like I don't know it's just like I guess it's like kind of. Just like I feel stuck you're kind of. Like.
740.0,Provider,"Oh, I mean when you say it's like. A will or the everybody who have."
13623.0,Patient,"i'm just like like financially stuck it's like hard to do. I entered by cron anymore like. It used to be like exciting and fun, I guess, but I mean. It was, I guess, it was kind of one sided back then every time I think about that i'm like Okay, well, it was fun, but who was it fun for just for me because I don't know that whole time he was having all these doubts so but I don't know."
740.0,Provider,"yeah. Oh, what do you think about everything now like well, what are your options, what do you plan on going to do."
13623.0,Patient,"i'm like I really don't know anymore like I kind of want to stay, but I don't know if that's just because it feels like a safe option for me. And like doing things that like have a lot of change, like kind of scared me a lot, so I just keep on beating around the bush and then next thing I know it's a year later. But. I don't know, I think that comes a lot back from like just how everything happened with my mom and like it just happened so abruptly now pray to like make the changes in my life that are going to like shake up everything."
740.0,Provider,"I mean. lived at the moment, always have to be bad changes, it can be changed for the better."
13623.0,Patient,yeah that's true. I just like that initial that initial feeling of change is just like really scary even if it's not for that long it's just like there's a lot of anxiety.
740.0,Provider,"Oh yeah. I mean, first of all changes very uncomfortable if you're not uncomfortable with me you're not changing. it's mostly uncomfortable is change, which means that it takes me out of my comfort zone, it takes me out of a regular routine it takes me out of my head, but I have developed within myself and it pushes me to try for more. You know i'm saying, and so I mean this your this this life for your choice. You know if you really want more or not, I think. A lot of times with. change everything is a risk. And either a lot of times, if you plan it right. And if you prepare properly, then you know he can actually benefit you but to stay where you are in something that is very unhealthy in something that does not, that is not conducive to. A positive environment for your mental health what's The difference is it the anxiety, I mean what's different than having anxiety. where you are versus having anxiety versus where you're going what's the difference in having depression, where you are versus being depressed if it doesn't work out what's the difference."
13623.0,Patient,I guess the work that it takes to get to a different like. situation.
740.0,Provider,Where it lives everything they where are they Where are you at with that with that guy who you barely like that they weren't.
13623.0,Patient,yeah.
740.0,Provider,"But again what's the difference, it takes one to put on with somebody that you really want to be with. yeah so what's the difference."
13623.0,Patient,"I don't know I just feel like maybe it's just. I try to keep I try not to keep do like putting it like back to like my mom but I really feel like the her relationship with men and how she would like just kind of stick through with it, even if it wasn't really healthy is just like. I don't know it just feels like so easy like I could you know I could, like him, you know, like I could like there's like moments, where I do see things working out, but at the same time, like I just don't know."
740.0,Provider,"Okay, but tell me ah let's talk about it so tell me tell me how you really feel about it."
13623.0,Patient,"I feel like he's like my best friend like we do a lot of stuff together we've been through so many chapters together, but like. I don't know there's just like a bunch of things that really just aggravate me about him as well, like it's so 5050 all the time and but sometimes it's like it changes, sometimes it's like at 20 sometimes it's like 4060 I don't know. But I don't know."
740.0,Provider,So what have been the aggravate you about him.
13623.0,Patient,"How he's just like on a so quick to like get irritable or like upset about things, though I don't know I just feel like i've also seen changes in that since like the time we broke up and then got back together, and all this like. he'll come back and apologize if he's like you know if he, like kind of like gets really mad at like one thing or whatever, just like. I don't know like. But. I don't know he's been trying to like I guess include me more like when he is. Like like. Doing his own thing like making music or playing a game, or something he'll try to like include me in it, or like have me do a part of whatever and that's been really nice like I feel like i'm a little more connected with music and things but. i'm sorry I forgot the question what's my train of thought."
740.0,Provider,"No, I was just saying, you see, I think the aggravating aggravate you about him. He was the bag already."
13623.0,Patient,yeah I feel like sometimes like yeah he just get like overly upset about something so small. Like not like physically upset but like verbally it's just like. Sometimes it kind of reminds me of my dad annoyed because he's just like my dad were really like at the drop of a dime just be so upset for what like where's this anger coming from.
740.0,Provider,So. Why. I will say this so do you love him.
13623.0,Patient,yeah.
740.0,Provider,"Ever not as a best friend, but as a partner."
13623.0,Patient,"I don't necessarily like know if I can see us getting remarried just because there's some problems that need to be worked out and they're not really being touched on, and like part of that's my fault."
740.0,Provider,"Why, then, why are they not be interesting."
13623.0,Patient,"Well, in the world, when we first got back together we're both supposed to go see a therapist and then at some point talk to one together but um he hasn't really found anybody and he's like in the military shouldn't be that difficult, in my opinion, but um. And then. I don't know I just feel like. And then the whole everything with the black girl that he was talking to was kind of like it wasn't swept under the rug it's talked about but that's definitely something that we were supposed to like kind of discuss like and like. therapy that he was supposed to find but. And then the thing with me I don't know like. I was like wanting to tell him in several different times and we're just talking or whatever, but like I just like kept getting like choked out by anxiety and I know it's not an excuse, but it's just like I just feel so guilty like."
740.0,Provider,"Always yeah about that I remember now. Right. yeah about you telling him. No, you still weren't able to do it."
13623.0,Patient,yeah.
740.0,Provider,"So. We can use mom as a scapegoat, we can say, well, my mama did it, so I got it honestly. But. You are your own individual person. Now of course let's have your exposures are based on what you have learned from her you can. mimic her choices and stay in something that you know doesn't make you happy. Or you can choose the right the cycle. And do something different."
13623.0,Patient,What does that look like.
740.0,Provider,"Well, what a different look like. A happy you a my. People hardly ever asked me questions. So different looks like be 31st. If it's about being honest with yourself and being also being honest with the person that you're with, and the reason why I say that because, like, I told you before. When maybe I told you before maybe not, but when you keep secrets. You eliminate their choice to choose you for who you really are. So basically you hold them hostage based off of a misconception of what they think they know about you versus what's really true. What is the phone manipulation defeat, which is really like. Because you came down on him so hard about the other woman. When really and truly at the same time, it was really you projecting on him because you knew what Judy was wrong. And it was just the fact that he got caught and you did. So, of course, I can come down hard on him. here know what ID. But at the same time, I mean chrissy. So part of being different is being better. Part of being better being on. The CD. How are you don't want to fit those consequences because you know. You know what's happening. There you know."
13623.0,Patient,yeah.
740.0,Provider,"I don't want to do my reality, so I just rather keep them under false pretenses. Well, how is it fair. To keep somebody on the false pretenses you wouldn't want somebody to keep you in the fall freakin. staging you. know even if you have experienced it before they don't make it right if they don't boo boo. Can you imagine me being married to my husband holding a deep dark secret that i've never told him. Imagine. Can you imagine. There with him. Before we got married. Doing my listening out there, making mistakes never tell him about it, he proposed I take the reins. Do you say I do I say I do too. And I got this guilty I got this deep dark secret he just thinking, I can be real face. Like, can you imagine. And the thing about it is, and I thought I think I need to tell you this, the longer you wait, the worst to get. It does. The longer you wait, the worse it gets because the first thing one of the one of the first. One of the first few questions they asked why you didn't tell me. Why us alone. So you could have told me and they know that they don't say you don't say so you don't go you don't come down on me with a you. may never fail."
13623.0,Patient,"I don't think it's right to like be defensive either, but it's like, for me it was like one thing and then for him, it was like ever since the whole baby thing and like that was years."
740.0,Provider,whoa baby was born a baby thing. Like the baby thing.
13623.0,Patient,"and That was, I think that was in like. 2018 at the end of the year. I got pregnant and we weren't. Oh, for that on so yeah."
740.0,Provider,i'm amazed me that. yeah mama.
13623.0,Patient,"And like I don't know throughout the whole thing like I don't know like really the only people that we knew that had been through something like that, and then. I don't know the whole time he was just talking to her like and then I don't know this is stuff like that kind of just hit for me like I don't know for me it's like I don't know, not to say that i'm better I feel like that's what's coming off as and that's honestly in my head."
740.0,Provider,"yeah. i'll say it's me me Ali, I want to hear me. But at the end of the wrong the wrong, no matter what level. don't remember levels all famous equal to sample so what's the date. No levels to it well you know my mom was move around and he was a big one that's like a meeting you know, like a wildlife and and realizing the black lives. and blue lives, and you know my live one is great, as I like to you know her life was really big but you know my life, it was like a mouse type last like. alive alive. It doesn't but see the thing about it is, it is far i'm gonna tell you oh girl doing or like me after the show you probably won't know most issues me I. will never tell you something there's a difference between y'all to, though. You end of the day, you already know. When we say. What so The difference is this, you know he's busy, but you don't know you. Because you know he has business and you chose to stay with him anyway. Why because of the fact, for him, it was security for you. I ain't got no place else to go. You know we'll just see what would you say we can work it out. So that means you made your choice to speak and say, despite you knowing what he be. The see you didn't you're not giving him the same choice to stick in space. despite knowing what you did to the different so really and truly he got the upper hand. Because you chose to fit him, despite his indiscretions. But you don't know you're. So right now you're taking away his choice. data. Then. there's a difference it's a difference, you got to make your choice to stay you're not giving him a choice to choose you taken away he's. For your own for your own selfish reasons. You take with you well you know he messes with security and he did, and he did it well i'm gonna go and I always adult in Atlanta, I mean, but so that means you're juicing people."
13623.0,Patient,yeah.
740.0,Provider,"that's not right either. alrighty. Because my thing is like this, you have to make sure at all time to to treat people the way you want to be treated. You know i'm saying at the end of the day. You know you have to you can justify in your mind and say well here's is worse than mine. But the thing about it is you know he is, but he didn't know us."
13623.0,Patient,yeah you're right I just don't know how to bring it up something like that.
740.0,Provider,"I wouldn't either, and you know the crazy part about it is the longer you wait. The harder it will get. Even if you don't know how to bring it up. I don't care if you got it right in a limb. Or you can write you can write down some notes. Of what you want to say me retool. But at the same time. If you finish up the Attorney. And job into summer UK by him and I just kind of surf the average something new challenges, and you know he's changing and he's including me so many things and blah blah blah blah. and manage all those things are great, but you know why he's doing all those things he's doing all those things, but so does that affect their he feels like our should we have to go down dashi lawyers, you may lose your dad for me to be unfaithful. And that's Okay, you can help them by the houses on the false pretense at least give them the option."
13623.0,Patient,you're right.
740.0,Provider,"So. This is what I would encourage you to do before you find a nutrition before if you found industry of you don't you need to download my fitness Pal. Okay, stop looking on Google. My fitness Pal will give you the accurate number of calories that you should eat every day."
13623.0,Patient,Is it different for like everybody like different agent like wait and everything.
740.0,Provider,yeah. with it. And then you just need to tell the truth.
13623.0,Patient,Like writing it down for cincy we're.
740.0,Provider,"gonna do what you gotta do all of that, all I can do is give you perspective I can't tell you what to do. In the day is your choice i'm just saying. That you cannot use the justification as an excuse to say hey what he is worse than mine. But you can't use it, because you know he is in, and he don't know you as I continued. And so. I mean is your tool. Is your choice, I know that he brings a lot of security for you and know that he gives you a place to say are this kind of stuff. So you know i'm saying is like all of us i'm sure that i'm I don't know what i'm gonna do we're gonna leave what i'm going blah blah blah blah so yeah it's easy to withhold the truth. For your own self as reasoning, but this thing I right just because it's easy."
13623.0,Patient,yeah.
740.0,Provider,"And then you know, then you up inside, which is why every time you try to tell them you saw breaking bad. You know, they could keep you. um. How often do I think dropping twice a month."
13623.0,Patient,"um I was I changed it because, like, I guess, I had like a moment and then i'd asked if I could see more often at the I wanted to ask you directly, but I, I guess, like, I had to ask the scheduling people. But."
