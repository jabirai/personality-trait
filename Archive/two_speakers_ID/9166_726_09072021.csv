So the way that on the program work is I am your therapist here at bright heart so as long as I see every two weeks, so we make an appointment after this session for two weeks from now. i'm as long as you're showing up to your appointments and sure enough to your groups, the the prescriber or. it's almost like the. If someone can't show up or they're not showing up consistently, then the prescriber will start restricting. The medication that there's something else so okay. So just keep that in mind yeah just keep that in mind, so like if you can't show up to an appointment just if you call and reschedule that's better than just not showing up at all.
