It wasn't a big deal i'm surprised, he was able to even keep them up there, for as long as our session was yes so because they will. They will get so."

15784.0,Patient,A lot.
416.0,Provider,"With a lot of togetherness, yes, I mean I love the togetherness, but sometimes it's all together and."
15784.0,Patient,"I was like yesterday. You know I I don't mind the kids follow me around the House because I know they. Every so often it's one kid out the blue that just wants to follow me everywhere and every time I turn around right there so. Yesterday, though I was just like as soon as I hit the corner my daughter was there and I went outside to dump the trash and I came back and she was sitting right there right front door, and I was just like you know what i'm going to be yeah i'm about to just go to be."
416.0,Provider,"Oh, my God. So you sound like you're in pretty good spirits are you."
15784.0,Patient,"Are it's been. yeah it's been good, we had a little spat of. Yesterday day before yesterday that lead into yesterday morning and no."
416.0,Provider,In your partner did.
15784.0,Patient,"yeah so we have to like I kind of just needed to sit him explain to him why I was feeling the way I was feeling, instead of just giving him the feeling. So. As I explained that he kind of understood what was coming from you. got with the Program."
416.0,Provider,"I mean, do you feel like you stayed in your wise mind about I think I was because I was trying to understand it, you know."
15784.0,Patient,"from his point of view in then for my own I wanted him to understand. Though that he is very he he plays a lot he jokes around a lot and i'm more of a serious one and i'm trying to get stuff done so, if you're playing around i'm like no I look, I want to get it in the way he's more of a procrastinate and didn't get it in."
416.0,Provider,So i'm. It how did it come up exactly Thank you.
15784.0,Patient,"um well it came a. Well, I don't know I just have a probably like waiting for people are waiting for someone to do something, or because he'll be live large. Because I clean clean clean i'm always cleaning something doesn't matter what it is i'm cleaning it. up and she's like you know you need to ask for help you need to ask for help, why are you doing everything like ask for help, but my problem is it's not going to do it when I asked you to do it, then I rather just do it myself."
416.0,Provider,Okay. um. So. It sounds like it kind of got to the point where it was about to hit a critical place but you were able to. Calm down. Right talk about it at arsenal way try to see it from his perspective.
15784.0,Patient,Right.
416.0,Provider,What do you think allows you to do that differently this time.
15784.0,Patient,"It was just hearing him say like you don't understand. And then I was just like whoa you know what I don't want to not understand, so I want to try to understand and then it leaves. It least try so once I listen, I understand what he's saying he's like you're walking around here talking about something hurting you know everything is not going to always get down with you wanted to give in and i'm like, but if I can get."
416.0,Provider,"So he's trying to say to you ask for help, let go like your need to your attempt to make everything perfect or try to get everything done really well your need for like control in order is actually hurting you it sounds like was what kind of he's saying."
15784.0,Patient,Right right.
416.0,Provider,learned about you.
15784.0,Patient,"yeah but i'm always looking at it like he's trying to build sometimes i'll take it as like you're trying to attack me so. Oh, and way no we're not doing that so."
416.0,Provider,"And this is where that wise mind comes in right where. Where it's like. so important to stay calm, so that you can really try and be able to hear what he has to say, today you don't just interpret it through your own lens. Exactly yeah."
15784.0,Patient,good job.
416.0,Provider,that's a big step.
15784.0,Patient,Is I don't want my partner telling me you don't understand it's kind of like it feel makes me feel like i'm losing control I don't understand something. Like that I have to be able to understand so i'm trying yeah.
416.0,Provider,"I mean, so when you guys ended that conversation, how did you leave it."
15784.0,Patient,"I kind of after listening under I told him I understood you think because I did it is hard for me, sometimes to know wait for someone else to do something when i'm literally not doing anything right now so. I just I don't know. yeah i'm like my motto has always been well if I don't actually win for him, one of it excellent real that's definitely not the true so."
416.0,Provider,What happened to be helps you and he doesn't do it the way you want them to.
15784.0,Patient,"um. It depends, like the other day he made the bed, and I was just like. well. At least you try. And then I fixed it."
416.0,Provider,Okay.
15784.0,Patient,"But I don't always like like it is something like sweeping the floor, or something and i'll see miss something, then sometimes obey you missed that part over there and he'll just go back and get it. But yeah for the most part we're starting things like if it comes to like picking out pajamas or clothes for the keys or something like that then i'll just let them do what it does."
416.0,Provider,Okay. So there are some things that you're able to let go of more easily than others and sounds like right.
15784.0,Patient,"But not cleaning the House, I, like my house clean."
416.0,Provider,"You like your House clean, I mean I, with seven kids for sure I mean, and I imagine it can get dirty pretty quickly."
15784.0,Patient,yeah.
416.0,Provider,Great thanks. Go ahead.
15784.0,Patient,"Not most of the time is toys in oh no, I have a habit of picking it up on the way we want them."
416.0,Provider,to your kids pick up their own twist.
15784.0,Patient,On my my two year old and three year old. it's like a.
416.0,Provider,yeah.
15784.0,Patient,"Sometimes i'll pick up the toys and is sometimes is more so my son my daughter my two year old she'll pick up the toys you no problem. um well my son he's about the 5050 sometimes he'll pick up maybe sometimes he'll look what he doesn't really do what to me but he'll look at that and tell them no. No, but he won't say to me because I don't go for all that."
416.0,Provider,Okay. yeah I mean i'm. So obviously with really little ones don't know do your older kids they have chores.
15784.0,Patient,"Yes, my older will fall as far as household chores not so my my. My everything, seven, eight year old we give them little chores like. Take the diapers out if there's a poopy diaper you know you're the diaper runner for the day our something like that are. Okay, is your day to go around and grab all the trash from the bathrooms or something like that little small things because they know, of course, you have to keep your room clean and you gotta keep your own space together, but as far as extra thing and then i'm. My teenager though she barely has shores and my spouse complains about that a lot, the only two are really give her is the key the upstairs bathroom by her room clean and do the dishes."
416.0,Provider,And why.
15784.0,Patient,Because also like I like to clean the way I like it.
416.0,Provider,"Okay, so you did the delegating part is just really hard for you, because you're worried she might not do it the way you want it."
15784.0,Patient,yeah oh no I like oh no I have probably dirty things. And really people always tell me when I coming out like you wouldn't even think it was a bunch of kids. The size toys being put in the play area or something other than that the rest of you wouldn't be able to tell cuz I don't have toys she's laying around everywhere laundry and all that I keep everything together we're organize.
416.0,Provider,mm hmm. So yeah I mean I hear that that's like that's really important to you that your brain likes things. Nice and organized I mean I can appreciate that i'm honestly exactly the same way I can't stand it when things are like chaotic it just makes me. It definitely puts me in a mood. So I can appreciate that and just trying to kind of think of. it's like a fine line right between the. The cleanliness and the organization helping you think clearly and they're becoming like such a compulsion that if it is out of place it's going to cause you to flip out.
15784.0,Patient,"yeah i'm there it's not in place every night I closed down the House I clean everything gets up to wipe it down everything every night. Wake up in the morning, I found all the kids have breakfast on the weekend again and he's like just wait just don't do it until naptime or I can't walk over a myth, I have."
416.0,Provider,Okay pretty thing that comes from what was it like when you were growing up.
15784.0,Patient,"well. When I was growing the House my mom is the same as far as the cleaning um, since it is they actually and but she didn't she didn't require us to clean, so we never clean."
416.0,Provider,Even we watched your mom take all that on to them.
15784.0,Patient,"Yes, she cleaned everything um well I do give them small things to do, but maybe my teenager could have a little a lot more maybe more tours but I don't know what other tours to give her."

You don't have to be responsible for everything I mean you're going to be responsible for a lot, no matter what right you got you got a lot of kids you have a lot of responsibilities there's no way of getting around that that is your reality. And if universal reality and lots of ways right you love your kids. And so, for you it's about you know just trying to find as much balance as possible that's why I keep talking to you about stealing time right stealing minutes here and there, delegating as much as possible but delegating does involve a release of some control, which is tough."

416.0,Provider,"And thinking about your we had talked last time about like really trying to be aware of your role vulnerabilities you know, have you eaten have you slept where's your mood checking in with yourself and making sure that you know your is. sort of is fortified as possible. So that you are less likely to kind of snap."
15784.0,Patient,"I have been doing a little bit better with the eating i'm kind of putting myself on a schedule. With demands that i'm taking cuz I think time set for one of them is when I started taking the kids me you taking it how I started, so if I took it before I ate our FBI agent keep doing it that way. Though I am take that medicine at nine and then by 939 45 i'm eating something small, whether it be a English mirth man or a half a bag, or something just so i'm not having a stomachache he didn't write it and then i've been eating for lunch so."

416.0,Provider,yeah okay so there's something happening you're feeling like you need to reach for that hmm.
15784.0,Patient,"I think the step in a way, with my irritation. Every time i'm stepping away. Voices go small okay i'm gonna fly yeah."
416.0,Provider,"So, then, that becomes kind of your excuse to step away."
15784.0,Patient,yeah.
416.0,Provider,"Okay, what if you were to try and just try, like every other time, like when you step away one time to have a cigarette or whatever, and then the other time do a little breathing and meditation."
15784.0,Patient,"yeah what could try that because I was trying like. Inside of her, because I know i'm stepping outside so often and I don't need to like a whole cigarette every time so i'll just like smoke flavor and then walk so I thought i'll finish it or something instead. But I can try that. yeah yeah."
