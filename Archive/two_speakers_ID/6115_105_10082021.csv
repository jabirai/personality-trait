ID,Role,Message
105.0,Provider,"Oh, my goodness, I feel like it's been forever. And maybe it's because I think you know why you dropped out in group I didn't I wasn't able to hear a little snippet from you. yeah what happened, what happens is your battery run out, or what happens."
6115.0,Patient,Every other Tuesday we're processing the check and so sometimes I have to get right back and by one o'clock. yeah I just I had to go back and.
105.0,Provider,When it's time just raise your hand and go first. This way I can hear from you.
6115.0,Patient,"yeah. tuesday's that we process. been working super late like we got out at 645. My time is 430 but I mean the latest we've had to work at eight o'clock and it's just. it's been i'm still hoping that it's getting better, and I mean I guess 645 is better than eight but it still hasn't. I mean the latest we used to work would be five o'clock So things are are a lot harder, we have one person out on maternity leave. So that makes things harder and then we have a new specialist who needs a lot of help so that takes longer to. So, and then with the new boss he's got the hang of it now so he's more helpful than anything but just still with the new in play, and then, with people being out it's it's a lot harder on us."
105.0,Provider,So you really do have a new boss it's not that same woman.
6115.0,Patient,No she's really gone.
105.0,Provider,Is it better.
6115.0,Patient,"A lot better I actually was telling my boss he's out yesterday and today, but on Wednesday, we were all talking and I told him it's really nice to be trusted to do my job. And not have somebody hovering over me and questioning everything because he had. Somebody from another department in his office, and so I poked my head in and I asked the guy from the other department, I said hey when you're leaving. Can you stop by my office, I have a question for you and my old boss would have made me go in there and explain exactly what I wanted and why I wanted him. To have been involved and and then, if he did stop by my office, she would have went with him and stood there the whole time, but the new boss, he what he just said okay. asked me about it or anything and he goes well, I trust that you guys will come to me, and you know if something's wrong or if you need help you know I don't need to hover over everything you do and I said that's so nice."
105.0,Provider,"Oh, what a nice relief you hung in there and got someone right that's easier to work with i'm glad."
6115.0,Patient,"Still harasses the other lead. really nice yeah yeah well cuz I guess she's friends with one of the texts, and so, of course, the tech. text her and tells her about all this stuff that's going on at work and then what happens is she ends up calling the other lead and it's like, why are you letting this happen, and I don't think you should be hiring another person, and you know. I know I told her I don't know why you take that I said she's not anymore like you can tell her it's none of your business. She just doesn't she gets all upset and she goes my stomach's and not every time I see that it's her. And you don't have to say to her, she chose to retire, and she needs to stay out of it."
105.0,Provider,So she's not retired she just go to a different department or something.
6115.0,Patient,"Well, she is so she's using up all her leave before she's officially off the books so she won't be off the books until November. So, but even if she decides to change her mind and come back she still can't come back as the manager because they're not going to kick the new manager out of his position they won't do that so. The CFO I have no doubt that if she wanted to come back, she would create a position for her. wow yeah. So we're still hoping November comes and she really gets off the bugs and then yeah then she's really done."
105.0,Provider,You know you had messaged a really cute little little text to me that you had applied the boundary setting of saying no to someone you want to share a little more about that.
6115.0,Patient,"So I use my example in group because it happens all the time with this person and she's been longer than I have so she's already she should know more than I do. But she she still needs help on according to her, she doesn't understand things and she still needs help on a lot of things, I have the strong belief that she comes to either me or the other lead so that way she can blame us. You know if she gets questioned on it, because if she does get on anything we help her with the first thing she'll say was oh I don't know Christine help me with that. or I don't know Michelle help me with that, instead of explaining and write everything down when we do helper so that way you know she can learn. But no, she doesn't even try to understand it or explain it she's just like oh I don't know where they helped me with that, like she was in it. And so, she always does, that she'll be like Oh well, i'm trying to explain it and they're not understanding me, can you explain it to them. And so what she happened to. eat on Wednesday and I told her you know what I said I have i'm really far behind and I don't have time to do that and she's like oh what she did was she went to her boss. And she asked him and so he was talking to her about it and then he ended up giving it to the other lead to do it. And I told him, you have to be careful with her, I said she will pass it off because she doesn't want it. And it goes he goes, I will he goes just with this, the unions, and so I can't afford for her to mess this up. So he ended up giving it to the other lead, probably because she told them, I went to her and she said no. So I wanted to tell him I didn't just say no, this is why I say no, she doesn't see me all the time. And yeah That was the only thing is, but he's also planning on he asked our opinion on this past Wednesday if we should have a staff meeting and i'm like yes absolutely because there's things that he's getting really angry at because. it's blocking work and there's mistakes being made and the majority of it is her. But he doesn't want to single out, you know in front of people so he's thinking a staff meeting go over with everybody let everybody know the expectations and I said absolutely I said, you should and then write that down that we met on this day. About this, and then the next time we meet if things have not improved, you can say things have not improved. and other ones are going to start. She needs to be accountable for her position she she did that to me yesterday, too, she she had somebody on the phone and she goes he's not he's arguing with me and he's not agreeing with me, can you please help me. And so, as a lead we're supposed to help you know if somebody's having a problem, so I did go in there, and he wasn't happy with what I was telling him either so he ended up going to our manager and. told them the exact same thing I did so, of course, he he hung up and was not happy, but he's not gonna get his way, but I mean sometimes I do get that we have to help, but there are times when she just doesn't want to do it, and it was funny because. You know, when we were doing the role playing and she was just like I don't want to and honestly, that is true, like the answer that she would, if she were being honest, but she never says cuz she doesn't want to show, he says, oh. i'm getting confused it's always an excuse, instead of the truth, which is really she doesn't want to and if she would actually say because I don't want to, it would be a lot easier to tell her no. But she always comes up with well i'm not understanding it or they're not understanding me or you don't agree with me, but she's she it's hard to. explain something to somebody when you sound like you have no idea what you're talking about I mean you have to have some kind of authority, and you know some confidence, especially if somebody is asking you about their pain. You can be. I think it's like this, you know, because then, if you like, you don't know what the hell you doing trust you and they're going to think."
105.0,Provider,How are you going to approach when this happens again.
6115.0,Patient,"Well i'm i'm gonna i'm not gonna ask questions that I did learn because I did do that all the time, I would always say why can't you do it. And it would end up going with us back and forth. So that i'm definitely not gonna do any more. So."
105.0,Provider,"But let me restate, let me just review something, just in case it was over generalized. I apologize for eating it's hard for me to find time to eat I book people with no lunch right. let's not confuse. What I was sharing earlier had to do specifically with the word why. it's not never asked a question it's the why question that's, the problem is that."
6115.0,Patient,yeah.
105.0,Provider,"Like right just just based on what you just said, I thought whoa my client thinks that asking questions, is where the heck that the argument gets going. But it's."
6115.0,Patient,"not always what I would ask, though, is quite can you do it. There yeah."
105.0,Provider,"So she's going to give you an answer isn't she she's gonna die. But really let's just say you were her supervisor, in a way you're the lead, so in a way, you are right."
6115.0,Patient,"um it's funny because the old boss never let us, you know she would always constantly tell us you're not the supervisor so she kind of drill that into our heads. The new boss, though he does this more as a supervisor but yeah I am i'm the supervisor technically of the tech the technicians, not the specialist and she's a specialist but she likes to come to me first, probably because I end up doing it so that definitely."
105.0,Provider,Okay well that might resolve it completely there. When you say i'm not able to do that I don't have the time to give to that. But if you want her to be someone to experiment with an other way of communicating. In that role of being a supervisor let's say. You might explore not asking why questions but. How many Joe have you run across something similar to this and solve this problem. Do you hear what I just did. that's different isn't it. yeah how.
6115.0,Patient,"It makes them think of solutions, as opposed to excuse."
105.0,Provider,"us know what she's having to do is she's now thinking about other scenarios that were similar. And she's having to think about what skill, she has and now she's problem solved it. How did you solve something similar to this, I imagine that's a key phrase, I imagine you've run into clients similar to this, what are some of the resources or spilled that skills you use to solve it. Now she'll have to answer herself with. I dumped it on other people she's not going to say that. And you just let her answer. And she was the first time you just ask it basically the same way again. Well, I imagine you've run into something a similar challenge like this, I mean this is a monthly, quarterly thing that happens, what have you done in previous months to solve it."
6115.0,Patient,"yeah that's a good idea and actually do something similar with one of the text. But she's a completely completely different person to where she wants to learn. and wants to improve. and wants to do it on our own so sometimes she'll come to me with questions i'll say okay well tell me what you would do and then she'll explain it and show me, you know the way she did it and then i'll say okay you're right up to this point, tell me what happened here. And, but she yeah with her, I guess it's always been a lot easier for me to do with her, because she truly wants to learn, and she truly wants to improve she doesn't want other people doing her work she wants to improve so."
105.0,Provider,"The tricky part with this other person is. You already know in advance her intentions and it's getting in the way of this natural flow, but if you stop interpreting and you only take what she's saying. In other words, the message she's sending to you as rescuing, but if you stop interpreting that and you only hear what she's asking Oh, how do you do this. Then you can go into the your how questions you know accessing past resources what you've done in the past. you're not answering you're helping her to answer her question her soul. She you do not accept anything onto your shoulders it stays over there, it is PR problem to solve, and you can help people to work through it that way, or at a minimum. you're setting a boundary."
6115.0,Patient,Now that makes sense.
105.0,Provider,But it's going to activate you because initially you've already made up your mind for our agenda is manipulative. And so that's the part you have some control over is to say okay i'm going to compartmentalize that and just listen to the content of what she's saying I know my first realization this is this is someone who's who's a bit manipulative and I don't really like that i'm. just going to listen to her and i'm going to address the content. Can you help me with this. How have you done something similar to that last quarter.
6115.0,Patient,Okay.
105.0,Provider,what's she gonna say.
6115.0,Patient,i'd be interested to see what she says.
105.0,Provider,"uh huh. Let me just rephrase it. How is it similar to. Last month's. kind of dilemma that I did for you. What did you learn when I did it for you. What did you learn. When did. You do wait, because nothing well, maybe nothing because she does it and doesn't learn shit. wow."
6115.0,Patient,"well. it's gonna be hard to to just listen to what she's saying, and not because I already. know. And then she gets if you point out that she's made a mistake, she gets very defensive."
105.0,Provider,So so. Is that your role really in to point it out.
6115.0,Patient,yeah because if she a lot of times she'll bring us stuff and say you know I overpaid this person or I underpaid this person or the pay is coming out wrong you.
105.0,Provider,Have.
6115.0,Patient,For someone where it went wrong.
105.0,Provider,"Okay, so you can use the same approach use the same approach Oh, thank you for bringing right it's good that she brought it to you, instead of hiding it. Oh i'm so glad you brought that to my attention Sarah do you already know how the mistake was. Right it's a question do is the, how do you already know how the error happened, did you work that out before you came in here. Or do you want me to kind of walk it through and point out where that happens, so that it doesn't happen again. Know ideally she'll say yes, because a reasonable person is not going to say no. she'll say yes. Say okay i'm suspecting it's here. There you go. it's different than Oh, you did this wrong, you know I don't know how you deliver the information, but again. You know, thank you for bringing it to my attention and you want to know kind of where it went sideways. I have a guess about it, let me look at this yeah I found it Have you already kind of worked it out and you already know. Yes, I already know how I made my mistake great tell me. She tells you like oh I don't remember now okay well i'm since you don't remember now i'm going to point it out, where I see it, and you can kind of see whether it matches, and you can remember, whether this was it. kind of like that. Different. slightly different maybe. we're talking a lot about work."
6115.0,Patient,at home.
105.0,Provider,Okay relationship with the daughters.
6115.0,Patient,"yeah things are going well there. I talked to JASMINE she's funny she she sent me a text and said, you know you're amazing right. And then I called her because she had asked me to call her when I got home from work she needed help with something she wanted me to help her father w four, and so I said, well, what was the text about and she goes because because she just started a new job she's working at a vet clinic. i'm working all day I got home did the dishes made something to eat and i'm so exhausted, and you have children to come to. Work and do all this and."
105.0,Provider,"yeah it takes a while, for them to finally grow up and see that."
6115.0,Patient,"But that was her about the w four because at work, you know I enter everybody's w force. But we're not allowed to. guide them. We can read the form with them and then tell them, you know it's your choice, what you want to put here, I can only put what you want, but we cannot ever suggest. Because, then, if they end up owing at the end of the year they'll say well is your fault, you told me to put that there, so we never ever suggest what I always tell my country, we cannot guide you if you have questions, it would be best to speak to a tax. consultant because everybody's situation is different, so of course I was teasing her and I told her well i'm sorry but I can guide you on this, I suggest you speak to a tax consultant she's like. she's good she actually was apologizing to me yesterday because the dog chewed the couch and I. Was not your fault, and she goes, we are so nice, but it was my fault, and I said listen with your teeth. And she. didn't know she. was doing my homework and I didn't know that's what they were doing. I said, you have homework to do, but I should have done it in the living room so i've been trying to work with her not apologizing for everything, not everything is. On my watch, so I feel responsible."
105.0,Provider,"How far does she take that guilt, what does she do it that anything self destructive. Okay well that's good."
6115.0,Patient,"yeah she still not drinking, which is good, but that was always her self destructive thing there was drinking. And then so like with the car that she had before this new car that I have to get. She had a lot of. Little fender benders hitting a curb or just a lot of. So now she's super careful in her car she hasn't. drink and I don't know exactly how long but it's been a while. She was actually talking to me and her dad about this, the other night, she said in. Her new job well she's been working there for a little while now, but. She said they always want to go out afterwards and their environments oh let's go have a drink and she says, I always tell them your. homework, or you know I love this to do or that to do so, she always tells them, you know i'm busy, but she met another waitress there, and she said it's so nice to meet somebody that has similar interest to me and doesn't want to go out and drink. Not so she's on the phone so that's Nice."
105.0,Provider,How are you doing on routine. You want a routine of walking.
6115.0,Patient,"The walking still sporadic. it's definitely not a routine. But I have lost weight i'm just working on my diet. Okay, I had hit 182 pounds at my heaviest I am this morning I am 168. So I have lost 14 pounds."
105.0,Provider,Oh. that's um that's a significant change with just changing what you're eating.
6115.0,Patient,"The cokes had a lot to do with it too. yeah cutting down on those definitely helped I do still have cokes but not as not constantly all day. And then I noticed, too, that since i'm not eating as much my stomach has shrunk a lot so like I can't eat as much as I used to before. Especially on the Sabbath when we would have Sabbath dinner I would get a huge plate and finish that and then have dessert and now I got a lot smaller plate, and sometimes I can't even finish all that because I get for right away."
105.0,Provider,yeah and that's.
6115.0,Patient,True it's becoming easier.
105.0,Provider,yeah your stomach does get smaller. shrinks yeah yeah. What about. What about relationship with husband. Communication.
6115.0,Patient,"it's been good we haven't had any issues, I still haven't gone further with why i'm in therapy. But I mean we've been getting along well I did going to get upset with him the other night over the dogs and he kind of got bugged and then just said i'm just going to bed, and then. The next day, I notice, he stopped that behavior so I guess it got to him, he just got bugged in the moment because he gets mad at. One of my dogs are barking all the time and, like she hears the noise and she starts barking and he's gonna yell at her so I got. And I said how many times have you yelled at her for barking and how's it changed anything I said doesn't do any good it doesn't do any good it just gets you mad, and she still barks I said so you. just get her upset makes her run away but she's still barking and then you get angry and you're yelling and then I get upset and I said, in the end, what changes so."
105.0,Provider,"What do you do, what are you doing she's barking you want her to stop."
6115.0,Patient,"i'll go and pet her and tell her i'll just kind of pet her and say. No say no, no, but I won't yell at her."
105.0,Provider,Work doesn't work.
6115.0,Patient,"Sometimes there's no stopping her. And it's just the one dog, because the other two aren't really barker's but it's just her and she's been like that, since we adopted her so I mean she's been like that, since we adopted her. And things haven't changed it's not gonna change, I mean she hears and she barks I told my husband dogs. How many ways to communicate and barking. So. i'm sorry she."
105.0,Provider,"Was there was there a relationship with that dog with him for some time now. That. Is there I don't know. Particular okay I didn't know if that was a story, you had."
6115.0,Patient,"He favors the newest dog that we got um but and it's funny because she's the worst behaved and she's the one that actually to the couch and pulled the stuffing out of it. And she shoot up a few other things so but for some reason that's his little sweetie I don't know I think it's because she has a small dog and he's used to having big dogs and so, for some reason I don't know if he's extra protective of her because she's little I don't. But she's the worst behaved of all of them and, for some reason heels and Lucy when she barks I don't know."
105.0,Provider,"Christina i'm looking at your treatment plan. And i'm noticing that we're typically I have some things fill in I want to ask you if we've done some stuff and it just didn't get transcribed, if you remember it just let me know and maybe it'll be about trying to find it. But if we haven't done it, it might be something that we could focus on today. did I ever develop with you, your resource team."
6115.0,Patient,know.
105.0,Provider,"it's an imagine thing, and it would be a protective figure and nurturing figure a wise figure does that sound familiar. Can we do that. So you have in your tool belt. To whatever degree you remember a breathing technique, which is the belly breathing. um do you ever remember it and use it. Yes, Okay, I believe I was looking through it just to make sure I believe i've taught you looks like I have the ground to get the five senses, you have, for your own going for a walk a drive. and remove self from situation if you're activated or triggered and you have self talk so Those are a few of the things Oh, you will also say to yourself, this feeling won't last that's been something effective for you. So what I want to do is add some imagery these are also tools that you can use when you are triggered by an event and for whatever reason, probably unconscious it's activated a much bigger reaction to the current event than it really needs. You know what I mean like Why am I reacting so big to this it's probably connected to your past somehow so we don't always want to have that we want to work through it we don't want to reach for a substance. And for some people, they use imagery it's also used this particular one the resource team I use in em Dr don't know that you and I will do that, but we may. And so let's do this. The first one, and this is imagination Okay, this is not this is going to be you kind of using your creative mind here for a minute. What I want you to do is I want you to think about real or imagined. A figure that. or image that is sort of this perfection it's not two things it's not also dangerous it is just protective so picture something either real or imagined that is a protective figure what what comes to mind."
6115.0,Patient,My dog.
105.0,Provider,"All right, my dog. Since you have multiple dogs i'm Am I to understand you you own one is somehow it's my."
6115.0,Patient,um he's just my favorite he's the biggest one he's my pitbull.
105.0,Provider,Do you call it my dog or does it have a name.
6115.0,Patient,I his name is patches but I call him Pooh bear.
105.0,Provider,"Then he is. Is he the one that barks. No okay so Pooh bear is a protective of you, you get that sense. yeah okay great. Next, one is a nurturing figure, and this would be a figure image character again real or imagined can be from a book TV show movie or your imagination. That wants for you to have everything that you want to achieve, you know that your potential is reached that you get what you want sort of that you got this girl, you know the nurturing that it's not affection right that's sort of. Another thing, but this is a nurturing figure what comes to mind for that character."
6115.0,Patient,Oh no that one's harder.
105.0,Provider,"Take your time, you might need to go to a book TV show maybe just picture someone. Supporting someone else encouraging helping someone else, maybe tap into movie but there's no rush Take your time."
6115.0,Patient,I think I like a mother figure.
105.0,Provider,So. tell me what you see. i'm gonna write it down. A mother figure like who.
6115.0,Patient,"Well, I wouldn't say my mom but."
105.0,Provider,There can't be ambivalence it needs to be sort of that pure singular. nurturing. doesn't have an opposite to it. Maybe you saw it in a movie or somewhere. It was just nurturing.
6115.0,Patient,A teacher.
105.0,Provider,"we're looking for. Okay, I can go with the word teacher but you're going to need to tell me who you see what you see. You have a concept of teacher just now, I can see that that's not quite where i'm going remember this is imagination so tell me what you see in your mind."
6115.0,Patient,I don't fancy like a cheerleader.
105.0,Provider,"A cheerleader there we go okay. Anything in particular about the cheerleader that you see. Okay, so I need to bring you back to it, which I often do I use words now adjectives to describe it to help people get there."
6115.0,Patient,Just happy motivating encouraging. supportive.
105.0,Provider,"And the third one, is a wise figure, so this would be someone who not only has stored information right they done some reading or they they've acquired this knowledge that they have stored. and They know how to use it, they are wise, so this figure is wise. real or imagined what comes to mind."
6115.0,Patient,"When I say my son. He has an enormous amount of facts in that brain and I always thought of him as an old soul, because of his manner of explaining things and his ability to debate without getting upset and he just seems like an old man to me."
105.0,Provider,"Okay. very nice. Well we'll go with that one there's a possibility. That one may have some challenges to it. But we'll we'll find out. Only because you've been your son so there's been a times when maybe you've been the wiser person. But at this age that you see him now, could you see him being a resource for you as a wise figure in your imagination, if you needed to go to I want a sense of wisdom, right now, I want to feel his presence, when you use this and he would be who you would want like right next to you."
6115.0,Patient,Know gone to him for quite a few things on this day yeah. She was kind of strange but yeah I have.
105.0,Provider,"Okay well we'll go with that then. Okay, so this other one the shifting gears those Those are the three that go with the resource team so you'll you'll hear me use that that phrase and we'll have this here in the note now. Next, one is called a container, and this is what you do is you imagine also still imagination. That there's a container that holds all your negative emotions and I want you to come up with one and tell me what it is, but the requirements are that it be big enough and strong enough to hold all of your emotional stuff. Think about what that might be."
6115.0,Patient,A garage.
105.0,Provider,"Okay, and how is that stuff going to be kept in there, a system of keeping it in there and not getting out."
6115.0,Patient,"lock. i'm. Mike. I guess, would it be like just one of those locks with the keys like that storage units."
105.0,Provider,And who has the key.
6115.0,Patient,Unfortunately I do.
105.0,Provider,"Okay beautiful. And next one is thinking of. safe place i'd like it to be somewhere that you have visited that was in nature, and it was beautiful and in that beauty, while you were there you had this sense of safety, you felt safe in this beautiful natural environment and where would that be."
6115.0,Patient,"The San Juan, river."
105.0,Provider,"Now i'd like to kind of explore this is getting away from imagery for a moment and we're not using them not teaching you how to use them, those are just there and we can explore. Their use another time but I will I have something in front of me that I call a subjective unit of distress it's a thermometer and It ranges from zero to 100 and yours is blank I don't have anything filled in on it and i'd like to put at least one thing on there. subjective unit of distress So if you think the most distressing thing, the worst thing that's ever happened to you. That would be at 100 right. You might have been the most scared you've ever been you might bend the status you've ever been you might have been the angriest you've ever been something like that. What was the event and you don't have to go into the story of it if you don't want to, but i'd like to write a little something the age you're at when it happened. i'll be asking you, you know what's the emotion that goes with it, and then the somatic response and just a little label of it if you would what's what is that 100 event for you. And if it isn't 100 you can pick another number i'm just saying, the worst thing because it's me learning how distressed you get with which stories, so I kind of want to know where are your highest is."
6115.0,Patient,um I was 16 and it was an attempted rape.
105.0,Provider,"Okay, and how distressing was that."
6115.0,Patient,"It was it was 100. Okay, I was terrified and crying."
105.0,Provider,"And the emotion, you know what the emotion was. yeah."
6115.0,Patient,I was definitely fear.
105.0,Provider,"terrified and. And just now, as you thought about it, what did you notice in your body."
6115.0,Patient,I felt tense. I just felt like my whole body tighten up again.
105.0,Provider,Do you have insight into that history and any connection to triggers that happened in your everyday life.
6115.0,Patient,"um if I feel trapped if I feel. Like if I feel like stuck if I feel like something's blocking me from getting away. So if i'm ever like challenged, or if I feel cornered."
105.0,Provider,"Does it ever happen just psychologically. versus just kept in a space, does it ever have you ever have a trapped stuck blocked. Experience but it's just. enter personally. i'm not."
6115.0,Patient,"If I ever have to do something really fast like if. I have like a really short amount of time to do something and it's really hard, then my mind will first will immediately go blank and I panic and then it takes me a minute to actually think through. I get like that, every time I have to do the retirement file as the other lead isn't there it's because it's really hard and it's really important and. anytime I told, I have to do it for the month I immediately panic and my mind goes blank and the first thing I think is I don't know how to do this and it takes me a minute to look at my notes and breathe and calm down and tell myself you've done it before you can do it. But anytime I hear, I have to do the file, I immediately panic."
105.0,Provider,"And there's a very tight short deadline for it, or no."
6115.0,Patient,"It has to be done within a week, yes. And that happens every month. But I don't always have to do it every month, but. I still have to do it every once in a while, just so I stay in practice."
105.0,Provider,what's hard about it.
6115.0,Patient,"I think what scares me the most about it is because it has to be completely accurate and it's for the entire district. When I do people's pay, I mean it's you know a few people are you know changes for a few people, but the ERA file it's for every single employee in the district and it's their retirement so. If I get overwhelmed."
105.0,Provider,Have you ever made a mistake with it.
6115.0,Patient,"I have when I was learning how to do it, but I had the other lead shadowing me and so. I tried to figure out where I went wrong, and when I couldn't, then I went to her and told her i'm asked by this and I can't find where it is."
105.0,Provider,"You did that go well, was the help available okay."
6115.0,Patient,"It helps knowing that I can go to her so i've only done it once where she was out for a few weeks and I had to do it on my own, and I did have to text her and call her because I started to freak out thinking, I made a mistake and but. it's it helps knowing that she's there and can help me if I come across a mistake, the last time I did it, though I did it all by myself and it came out right so but i've only done it all by myself right once."
105.0,Provider,"How many months ago, is that."
6115.0,Patient,It was one of the previous supervisors here so maybe four months ago.
105.0,Provider,"And way further down on this subjective unit of distress at maybe a 10. That was, you know this event you're talking about earlier had to do with being at 100 what might be a level of distress without a 10."
6115.0,Patient,knocking myself out of the House.
105.0,Provider,"Okay what's the emotion, you get with that. And where do you feel that fanatically in your body."
6115.0,Patient,I guess more just in my head it's more frustration and anger at myself.
105.0,Provider,"And, have you ever had an experience, where it went below zero so for some people notice how I was talking about fight well, maybe I didn't I think I said anger fear, but I wish I had said it differently, the zero to 100 really represents mobilization. reactivity meaning, you might kick into fight or flight, we might run away or we might. fight for the anger comes up or we fleet. And you can always change your response, by the way, because i'm explaining it further, as we continue talking but there's another one below zero the one below zero, and it can go all the way to 102 is freeze. it's immobilization whereas mobilization from zero to 100 above zero is we might run so we'll be taking action will either you know use this adrenaline in this mobilization to fight, or we would run. Was there ever one where you dissociated checked out froze became unconscious in a sense."
6115.0,Patient,My cousin committed suicide.
105.0,Provider,"Okay, maybe there was a sense of last time from that."
6115.0,Patient,"yeah the days from when I got the call in the middle of the night to when he actually passed away in the hospital lasted a few days, but it just kind of all felt like it was all one big blur together."
105.0,Provider,"How far taking that except same sort of scale right from zero to 100 and distress what number, would you put that out, as far as the freeze response, the unconsciousness the dissociating and checking out."
6115.0,Patient,By about a 50.
105.0,Provider,that's going to be like a negative 50 okay.
6115.0,Patient,"No, I don't know if i've ever experienced anything stronger than that."
105.0,Provider,"mm hmm and how do you know notice that I was saying these others are mobilization and where do you and maybe in your body, how do you know that the response to this one was different, this was a immobilization a checking out how do you know what was that."
6115.0,Patient,"I felt really tired, the entire time really exhausted, but couldn't sleep. didn't really talk very much. Honestly didn't even cry a whole lot it was just kind of. I don't know just like link like I was sad and I was actually surprised I didn't cry, as you know a lot more than I did, but I just kind of. I kind of thought of myself as just kind of like a lump just kind of there."
105.0,Provider,Do you have a sibling that used to threaten suicide.
6115.0,Patient,yeah my brother.
105.0,Provider,"And each time did we do that, you know that scale or just gave you where does that fall."
6115.0,Patient,"At the beginning, it used to. I would react right away and try to talk him out of it or stop it. But at the end I just I stopped being involved in it."
105.0,Provider,How distressing in the earlier episodes was it.
6115.0,Patient,It was about a 7080.
105.0,Provider,"And then. In the latter. How intense was the the distress what number, would we give it."
6115.0,Patient,"That would probably even be a 10 or 15 because it the very last time that it happened, it turned into an anger frustration thing not even scared."
105.0,Provider,"Okay i'm realizing china's. We did a lot here, this gives us some good information moving forward. Is there anything that you do want to add, because this is a review day and I updated the ones that we do have for you is there anything you want to add as a goal either communication spiritual. emotional anything you want to add it's a goal."
6115.0,Patient,i'm just definitely working on personal boundaries and saying no.
105.0,Provider,"i'll just write it that way, I want to work on personal boundaries and saying no. Yes, okay. Many times a week, do you think you do it, so that we can have it increase, we can see that there's an increase How much are you doing it either percentage wise per week."
6115.0,Patient,i'm saying he has probably a good 70% during the week.
105.0,Provider,And you'd like to see it go up over the next 30 days by what.
6115.0,Patient,i'm at least 10%.
105.0,Provider,"um how about November 5. met at nine. That is that okay to do the same timing. Okay alright so 9am on November 5. it's a Friday. All right, well you'll either well, you will you want to explore how to continue to get routine with the walking in there. And practicing those skills of setting boundaries, and if you want to play with a little bit of asking how someone has in the past, solve the problem. and using this phrase, I imagine, is also very handy to have I imagine you've had some success with solving a similar problem last quarter, how did you solve it, how how how how how how how."
6115.0,Patient,Okay.
105.0,Provider,"see what happens, I mean you might look around and realize I don't know how to ask those questions, but at least we'll know where to explore further."
6115.0,Patient,"guarantee i'll get to use that today, at least once with her."
105.0,Provider,"All right, well, I look forward to talking to you next time. enjoy your weekend."
