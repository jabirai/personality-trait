4886.0,Patient,"No, given the cup and was told to go ahead and place it up there on that shelf and then they were still running around you and other things, so it could have easily very, very easily. gotten picked up or even switched by somebody but that there's no way. I received I received the tests in my email, and I was I about fell over. Because it's positive for things I haven't even that i've never even done."

323.0,Provider,So we. i'm not seeing results in here yet in our system yet.
4886.0,Patient,Okay that's why I don't understand why I keep getting the results for you guys yeah.
323.0,Provider,I mean it looks like we sent in an order for. A full panel of screening. All right. and your client you're claiming you're taking nothing but the suboxone and so.
4886.0,Patient,"The only thing that I just and I, this is knowing I have merit medical marijuana card. yeah a couple a couple weeks ago I ate I ate a got an edible. With my own I get migraines. yeah that's. that's already been like even a couple weeks ago that I don't even think that would even be in my system and it popped there on that test results I got back last night. It was positive for amphetamines was positive for cocaine, it was positive for all, it was positive for marijuana on all this stuff down like what."
323.0,Provider,"OK. I will send a note to Dr cell that you got your results I don't see him in the system, yet they're coming obviously because they should be sending them over to us. That you're disturbed by the results and saying that they're not yours and i'm going to make a suggestion that we send in a new order with. Like within a couple days to try to get another reading on this."
4886.0,Patient,"Yes, please. Because there's there's no way possible, that that's that's my chest. My even my last test when I went there i'm. Perfect like it should have been yeah I mean."
323.0,Provider,yeah and while we sent you because we had that one that was a little wacky anyway. Right and I said that I didn't think that was you.
4886.0,Patient,So let's.
323.0,Provider,"You know, do some other screenings, and so we. have been. Right it's just seems too weird that it's coming up again. i'll see Dr cells, probably going to want you to meet with her so. I don't know what your schedule is like, but you might want to and I can't see her schedule. You might want to. call the virtual clinic and see how soon next week, you can get in to see her to have a conversation about this as well."
4886.0,Patient,Okay we'll do.
323.0,Provider,In the meantime i'll obviously send the note over to her.
4886.0,Patient,"I seen the results, last night I knew I had. The one on one with you today so that's basically I was just like well, we talked to you see what you say, to do. yeah. You know before I make any other calls or arrangements, but like I say when I seen that late last night, because the results even came in like late came in at like 10 o'clock last night I got an email, I was like oh that's weird. right there and looked at, I mean I sorted I about painting."
323.0,Provider,"And according to your report, you had one edible thc about two weeks ago."
4886.0,Patient,Maybe even longer than that ago. That shouldn't even I I doubt would even be in my system and longer.
323.0,Provider,did your suboxone come up in your reading.
4886.0,Patient,I think it was like a low reading.
323.0,Provider,Really okay you're taking it every day like you should.
4886.0,Patient,yeah absolutely. Absolutely even my last my last test levels were all what they would shoot a band and that's all I came up for. And that was from class that was last month.
323.0,Provider,That was from.
4886.0,Patient,should be like September 7 or something. or August 7 I mean i'm sorry.
323.0,Provider,yeah yeah August 7. yeah and everything looked fine there we just. forward with a more comprehensive panel.
4886.0,Patient,Okay yeah.
323.0,Provider,"gotcha I see Dr cells note in there about that one. All right, well i'm not sure how the medical team will want to handle this, but I do appreciate your request to get another one done and do it soon. And then, like I said just get something scheduled, so that you can talk with Dr cell about it as well, so that she can hear. what's new with you and then. Do you have another appointment scheduled with me for this month."
4886.0,Patient,"Yes, I do."
323.0,Provider,"Okay, so you're set with a."
4886.0,Patient,Week two weeks from today same time.
323.0,Provider,"Okay, good and then what are you making into group, what are you doing about that."
4886.0,Patient,yeah i've been going to group every week.
323.0,Provider,"Okay, so those would be the only thing that would kick you out of compliance if this. gets stuck on your. yeah and your record okay."
4886.0,Patient,"And I even just had a letter of compliance a made for me, a couple days ago sent to my probation officer, because I just got basically released from probation. And I mean, thank God, that this happened, like after that."
323.0,Provider,yeah.
4886.0,Patient,"You know, because you know these with the letter and everything I was in compliance that that they received and they're they're basically done with me I just I got to do a couple days of our house arrest and i'm complete with everything I had to do for my Ob I. OK, I get my actually today my license suspension is up today."
323.0,Provider,so good.
4886.0,Patient,"I actually get my license back all my privileges back, I mean I had driving privileges, but arm I have those stupid party plates that they make you get. A vehicle and I, as of today, I can have those taking off."
323.0,Provider,Okay.
4886.0,Patient,"So Monday morning i'm going to the dmv getting that stuff squared away so I can get my regular plates back on my truck and get my regular license back, instead of having a State ID. Okay, I don't have to worry about carrying my paper driving privileges everywhere, with me and all that stuff. Right so."
323.0,Provider,So everything was coming into place.
4886.0,Patient,"yeah everything's been everything's been top notch I just been doing what i'm supposed to do. yeah that's why I was like you know this this blew me away last night, and I mean like literally I showed my girlfriend i'm like look at this a she was even like. You know she's like how could it come up for her I don't know when you when you take suboxone she's like I don't even understand she doesn't really understand how that works."
323.0,Provider,Right.
4886.0,Patient,"i'm like well, I mean it could come up for it, you know if somebody did while they're taking on while they're taking suboxone even go beyond the suboxone first that wouldn't make you sick, but I mean if you took suboxone. While you were. You know, in the middle of having a habit, it would make you sick so she didn't she didn't understand that, but I told I said yeah that could still happen, but but i'm like none of these this I haven't taken anything. I just been doing what i'm supposed to be doing."
323.0,Provider,"In the quest lab that you went to that, like the closest one to your House is. Why, you went to that."
4886.0,Patient,"Totally understaffed. And like I mean it was just excuse my language, it was cluster Fuck there honestly that so many people in and out of the door. or they weren't paying attention and nothing I just told me when I came out of the bathroom to go ahead and leave my. My cup up on this shelf and go ahead and go on one lady was weighing in the back the other lady was like over in an office, nobody was really paying attention to the areas that I mean it was just. Anything could have happened, they may be made labeled it wrong with y'all because there was other ones out there, I didn't really you know I didn't really sit there and pay that much attention like Okay, are these labeled in this that I would never expect that to happen."
323.0,Provider,Right right but.
4886.0,Patient,It but it definitely wasn't. I mean i'll go to a different question.
323.0,Provider,Well that's what I saw a couple things there are labs we can send you to the hospital whatever nearest hospital is to you. And or find a different question I don't recommend.
4886.0,Patient,same a different question.
323.0,Provider,"And don't leave it until you see them seal it. And label it. yeah don't leave it on the shelf when they say it's fine there, even if it has your name label across the side, make sure they they seal the top cover part of it. yeah it was."
4886.0,Patient,"fun, this was nothing short had no label on it, or anything."
323.0,Provider,So yeah so that's not okay.
4886.0,Patient,Okay.
323.0,Provider,"So make sure get the contact information for another quest nearby that's not too far for you. Okay, that when you talk with Dr sell in order to make the request they'll have the name and address of. Where you're exactly to send it."
4886.0,Patient,"Okay, will do."
323.0,Provider,"So um. Alright well i'll wait and see what Dr cells recommendation is going to be and i'll consult with her about the conversation, you and I are having. And just kind of we'll go from there, and try. to grow yeah. Okay, I mean worst case scenario, it stands and then you, you know you'll be out of compliance for a little while you'll have to do another one in the month, but I think we can send you for another one."
4886.0,Patient,Okay.
323.0,Provider,"At this point do we bill your insurance for it, the screen okay so we'll probably able to build it again. To do a good one."
4886.0,Patient,Very good.
323.0,Provider,"Okay, I appreciate that I just want to get this squared away as soon as possible, I you know."
4886.0,Patient,"It shook me up when I seen it i'm like thank my lucky stars that that you know that the. Just the way the dates for that I happen to get this letter of compliance before that happened. Absolutely, but not going to really, really. Bad it could have been yeah it could have gone bad waterways."
