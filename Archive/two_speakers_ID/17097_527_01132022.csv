You know, asked us if we want to come and live with them, and my aunt and uncle said, you know we can't keep you because we already have three kids we just don't have the money. And so we said yes we'll go. And I don't really know he didn't really know him too much because he was kind of gone from our eyes for about three years."
527.0,Provider,"Well, I was going to ask, he did you even visit dad me in between that time."
17097.0,Patient,"Remember, like two visits. Okay. And they weren't one was for us to go. hang out where he's out, but then it was more like he had to work and. Some lady that he was seeing was there. Okay, and then the other time I don't know if it was for us, or to make a payment or whatever. So. We didn't I don't there wasn't this Oh, I see you, you know every other weekend. Share none of that. Okay, so kind of going so we said yes, you know. will live with you because we don't really know we don't want to live with our step dad because we already know outbound that is. yeah so we went to live with. Basically, new parents right. Because he had remarried and she had a daughter. Okay, and, as it turns out my sister and I. who came to live with them. My new step mom was we were not wanted. Okay, and. So lots of favoritism and those kinds of things to her daughter over us, we were always. You know, bad page back or whatever so kind of live like that. Then, when when my sister turned 17 she ran away and I turned 18 I left. So from 18. I got involved with a pretty bad crowd okay drugs. Lots of drugs. So that kind of happened for about four years. Okay, then from there. At one point in my life I was like I have to. figure this out."
527.0,Provider,"Okay, were you homeless at the time, or just kind of couch surfing or."
17097.0,Patient,"not necessary, I was always had a job. Okay matter what I always had a job. Okay, always could pay for a room or rent."
527.0,Provider,Okay.
17097.0,Patient,"So I always had a place to go lay down and go to sleep. I mean, there was a while, where I was living in a cockroach. infested house with no bad and sleeping on the floor but. Those are rough times so. And then. So from there, I ended up. Some issue happened nothing happened and some older friends kind of did an intervention I was far away like nobody knew that my family, where I was. I was doing nothing. I didn't want anybody involved I knew I knew that I was dragging myself down and. Whatever I was doing myself."
527.0,Provider,Sure okay.
17097.0,Patient,"So, but at one point I end up live with a friend, so that gave me a little bit of time to. think a little bit better and. I ended up long story short, I ended up joining the military. Okay, so I have trying to find something I couldn't go to college, they said, you know your parents made too much money."
527.0,Provider,And i'm like.
17097.0,Patient,"But they're not going to pay for my college. i'm 21 years old, or whatever or not paying for my college so. And so I just didn't have any options, this is like no options work and all that, so I ended up joining the army. Okay super good decision. I did four years in the military."
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
17097.0,Patient,"and got out. Had gotten married at the end of my four years that we were divorced, by the time we came back to California after I got out then nine months we were divorced, so I was more of a ride to California, that I was anything else. Okay, so. Okay, so so after the divorce I hadn't been working again I was working all the time. With my friend to kind of jump back into the drugs a little bit. skip still getting promotions still working hard, I was never are not a hard worker. Okay, so. And then I finally got my. head on straight I got my own apartment so I guys, you know I made a decision that I was going to do my up you know, I was going to figure this out somehow. Okay, so I got my apartment and started kind of separating myself from the drugs a little bit there was still easy to get."
527.0,Provider,But.
17097.0,Patient,"It was a little bit less. Okay, and then I. I got on with the stage. And so, that was a really good thing because then I made enough money to actually afford my own part. Okay, and then. Then a. year or two, I met my wife, but I have now."
527.0,Provider,Okay.

527.0,Provider,Oh wow good. yeah.
17097.0,Patient,So that's been a big change.
527.0,Provider,But definitely.
17097.0,Patient,"through all of that stuff you know, there was a lot of other stuff by experience I experienced some difficult stuff in the military. For instance, we went through. An official pow camp training exercise where you know, I was being electrocuted over and over and over again, you know that kind of stuff I think you know. That kind of does something to you, but. uh but yeah so and then the last 30 years it's been working for the state. Okay, my wife living a pretty good life."

17097.0,Patient,sharing it with you like right now it's kind of emotional because I normally don't think about or talk about it much. But. yeah it gets Sometimes I get emotional sometimes I can cover it and it's. it's not a big deal. I think it's in my environment here i'm here for emotional reasons. amy that's.
527.0,Provider,Making a little bit more emotional sure.
17097.0,Patient,I tell the same story at work and be very straight faced and very straight line.

527.0,Provider,Okay.
17097.0,Patient,"Okay now what's contributing to my current dilemma. Honestly, my sure."
527.0,Provider,yeah yeah well how much you know if we look at it like how recent did you retire deal.
17097.0,Patient,"Oh i'm i've been retired July 1. Okay, so not quite just yeah I just retired."
527.0,Provider,"OK OK. And, was it up, was it planned."
17097.0,Patient,"For you, yes."
527.0,Provider,"It was OK OK, I didn't know if it was something that you know you plan to retire but made planned, but it came earlier than anticipated for you."
17097.0,Patient,"yeah if the work environment would have been better, I would have probably continue to work. A little longer. Just a little like a year."
527.0,Provider,Okay okay.
17097.0,Patient,"But the money as it turned out the money to get my regular paycheck. It turned out that I could make that happen by July 1. Okay, so kinda no reason to really go any farther unless I wanted to make a little bit more money. Sure, but. With the environment being so bad, and all that at work. It was very difficult to get through the day I mean. i've got my peers, you know they are contributing to massive problems upper level management is continuing the you know and i'm like what is going on here. Now so. yeah so where I worked, you know i've worked at multiple state agencies so i'm familiar with lots of different styles and. different things, and how and the things the things that we experienced the same, no matter where you go that. was my wife work for the state and retired from the state, you know she put in like 30 years. Okay, so um and you know wasn't very positive either some of the things that she had to go through so. yeah which is kind of I always felt very like that was sad, you know that. You know that that's how the career kind of ended. yeah and now the last year, the career was better just because I got a boss, who actually knew what only he was supposed to do, but what we were supposed to do and everybody around us what they're supposed to do. And we tried doing that. However. The other teams were not following along. With using. I don't know how that works when you use what the department tells you to do."
527.0,Provider,Right yeah um.
17097.0,Patient,"So that's that's the kind of like. yeah so I mean it got to the point to where it's like yeah I think i'm at my wit's end anyway. You know, so now my staff, they were great they, like me, I like them."
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
17097.0,Patient,To the point they are really worried about who we're going to get for new supervisor. You know it's like. People I am a coaching and mentoring kind of a supervisor.
527.0,Provider,And okay.
17097.0,Patient,"So i've done my career that way. Where I go i'll say most state supervisors in my experience don't. You that coaching and mentoring much. Okay, and. Like my my one of my peers, you know she just did it straight from email hardly ever had any meetings with our staff. backfired on a bit. So. My thing was silver service and can be a lot of fun."
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
17097.0,Patient,"No reason in the whole world, why it has to be crappy just no reason for right it's the people, the jobs are great. But the people they are over their head they don't know what they're. doing it was just kind of ramp ID. So. Not every words like that you know but. Some of the areas that I got stuck in or okay. I kind of volunteered to like rotate and try something new. Sir, no and stop. And I guess that was. Looking back on it now, I think that was like. Maybe those areas where people are rotating work, the best of areas. catch on. yeah. You know i'm very i'm like i'm proud of what I did. i'm proud that I. The way I work with my people. I helped a lot of people out. My career so. very happy don't have any. Oh, I wish I could have done that or wish you know, the only thing I wish of is maybe I would have left it went somewhere else, but you know, then again. As many issues, as I was going through the department itself, you know, had good things in place so when covert hit."
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
17097.0,Patient,"I already had people who would work one day a week from home, so we had policies procedures routines everything in place all I think we did is open it up to every day of the week, five days a week. Now it took us a while to get through that but, once we did it was pretty. Smooth sailing was pretty easy. Now, I was in teams meetings virtual meetings all. day long all day long for like a year and a half. But like I said it doesn't stop the. Toxic people from doing their thing in meetings even. The boss, is there with everybody's bosses there. yeah over every single week. Anybody stopping."
527.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
17097.0,Patient,"Well, let these people go to the meetings for crying out loud."

Sometimes you know, like an evening time she usually, when I do it, I get a certain time because it I use it to help you sleep in for pain. Okay, I do have. an order for me to talk all my opinion it's kind of a three pill process. of using pills so it's inflammation it's a muscle relaxation and then of course the pain. Okay, in order for your brain and your body your muscles to all like I can take one, but if it's if they're still reacting and your brain is still getting those signals it's not gonna it's kind of like a three pill process.

Okay, but the restriction now is and. And I do get headaches from my neck. And so, and that is when I have, I have to take a pain pill for that. Okay, then, no, no, go away.

17097.0,Patient,well. Not good I didn't really have much friends. So. My last name was butts original one. So. Taking that into consideration kids are awful. yeah downright awful.
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
17097.0,Patient,"I was little for my size, I was geeky looking and I was bullied often. Okay, so you know the kids would always pick on. So I had to deal with that the whole school thing."
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
17097.0,Patient,"Okay, and I think at one point in time, I got a little bit I was still in the 140 pounds, but I got a little bit bigger when I was in high school and and I. met some I met a friend and kind of joined a. group called I won't call them again i'll just call my group because. I think a gang is a little more to. That that's we weren't there. But we were."
527.0,Provider,To that level.
17097.0,Patient,"yeah we're not at that level, but we were a group that would. stick up for each other. Okay, and there was racial fights and things of that nature if you're white you get caught in a bathroom with some black people they. Could beat you up right. or sometimes it were we find out about it we're chasing those people. So. Your summer that high school was not. Finding friends was hard for me, because I was shy. Okay, and then all the negative stuff that impacted me. yeah so friends were was kind of hard I had some when I got in high school, but you know, then again some of those friends were end up being on the wrong side of the fence, if you want to say that."
527.0,Provider,Okay sure. yeah how did you grade wise to school.
17097.0,Patient,"For the most part, I was pretty much like a B student school was very hard, because. memorization it's all memorization 1928 United States good work I don't know and I don't care how many times, I read it. I think I developed somewhat of a phobia about tests, I don't."
527.0,Provider,yeah.
17097.0,Patient,"So, but for the most part, I was kind of average B student until I started hanging out with the wrong kids in my junior year. Okay, then I missed significant amount of school okay. But I was able to go to some classes. And and pass. Okay, without going there, like a pasta Klaus that I missed a lot, but when I was there, it was an I remember this being an accounting class and the teacher says, you know look i'm going to give you a see because. I don't know how you're doing it, but i'm asking questions in the class in the straight a students aren't raising your hand, but you are. get it right. yeah no that's like well I just read that part. My participation participated, or whatever, but I managed to get through, so I I. I had enough credits to graduate but I. did not have. All the prerequisite classes."
527.0,Provider,Okay.
17097.0,Patient,"I failed, this is ironic. I failed government like two times. Government class. One time I walked out. I told the teacher what I thought men left. Okay, and another one, I like I just flump because I just couldn't get it. Okay, but I ended up going to summer school. After I turned I turned like so graduation was in June right but I had to go to summer school and take that class and I did pass it with a dd finally. Oh cool and so I, my name is included on the normal list of games. Okay. No delay my graduation. Anything so I got my you know my normal deployment staff. Okay, good good."

And I think. there's no way i'm smart enough to do computers i'm just too stupid to do that she's like no man you got this you got this right, so this friend of mine, she convinced me into doing this and it turned out, I haven't had a. MAC or an affinity to do it, but but I loved learning. Okay, was like a. It was like learning how your body works from the atom level. Okay that's how amazing it was for me."
527.0,Provider,Oh wow. For you.
17097.0,Patient,"yeah, and so I found out that I really liked it, so I took classes at Sachs or city college American river college and most of them, though I was at uc Davis extension, sir.

Night class and then the work they were really good to they sent me two week long courses all the Microsoft courses a bunch of those. So i'm not sure if you're familiar with that, but. Microsoft has certified."

I told her you know I said I don't I said I need to I want to talk to somebody. As I don't have any other. I don't know what else to do. Sir so maybe talking. About whatever gets helps me or fears figures out my goal is to kind of figure out what why i'm like this, whether it's a whether it's up here or it's a blood level thing or chemical thing or. Whatever thing. Sure, whatever I gotta try to figure out what it is."
527.0,Provider,Okay yeah.

527.0,Provider,"Have you ever talked about much of this stuff before until today okay so. I want to. Okay, so kind of opening that doors probably gonna stir up some things. But I think, maybe trying to make some connections to understand you know where you're at how you got to where you're at at this time. You know i'm guessing there's probably some you know post traumatic stress from the military there you know a lot of times is but you've also witnessed a lot of trauma to at very significant. Time in your life too so."
17097.0,Patient,"and In addition to some of the things I mentioned, I have been a predicament, with a loaded gun next to my head where somebody was threatening me. And i've been shot out. not necessary at me, but it was out the House and my head. I was sleeping next to the window. yeah that's kind of you know. yeah like.

Please Assad pulled us over. Had they searched the car really well."

527.0,Provider,"yeah close calls that's for sure. yeah well what we'll do now Dale is schedule some appointments for us to meet again. And then, that we will have some on the books usually what I do is schedule a couple at a time and then, when you have one we'll schedule another one or two. Just to make sure we tried, the best I can, if we can get on a sometimes it takes a few weeks to get on the same schedule, but if we can maybe sometimes keep it close to the same to same day or same time. kind of makes it a little easier to remember, but. But yeah. So. yeah flexible okay well."
17097.0,Patient,"You know, I have a lot of places I gotta be right."

527.0,Provider,Okay that's okay.
17097.0,Patient,yeah so I missed it.
527.0,Provider,"All right, well that's all right, sometimes, sometimes I have a hard time keeping track of what day it is too so and then you have group on Tuesdays so we won't be able to schedule our sessions and group on the same day because it's two therapy services on the same day.
