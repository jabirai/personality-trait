8739.0,Patient,"What is even bipolar what is, I don't even, can you tell me."
298.0,Provider,"I mean sure sure so by fuller has manic episodes and they have depressive episodes and there is bipolar to which doesn't mean you go as high as a manic episode where you're awake for four days very risky behavior. bipolar tues can rapid cycle to where they're there. for no reason at all don't be in a really good good mood and talk really fast and they'll rapid cycle into a depression again and there's. bipolar to has real cyclic things about it bipolar one is more of the things that you become manic and it kind of gets you in the hospitals so you're obviously not a bipolar one, and since I have seen you I don't even see evidence of a bipolar two right now i'm just not seeing it."
8739.0,Patient,"Okay. I don't think I don't have nights where I don't sleep for four more nights I haven't been hospitalized I don't I just mostly anxiety, I feel like."
298.0,Provider,i'm but it sounds like is anxiety a parent you're anxious your stress levels get so by there's a certain level of paranoia that goes with it.
8739.0,Patient,"yeah I still function know even when I feel that way, I still. I still maintain, and I still do what needs to be done and that that makes any sense I mean. Yes, I might be.

298.0,Provider,"Now, are you taking the hydroxyl seen. No Okay, and you did not like how that made you feel."
8739.0,Patient,"um I never took it I researched it and I just felt like that wasn't what I was. Like mostly said it was for like anti aging, and it was for dental procedures and."
298.0,Provider,I remember the conversation. And they decided to take it.
8739.0,Patient,got it just didn't feel like that was what. suited me I don't know.
298.0,Provider,It is a and I think I may have told you this it's a it's like a daytime cousin to benadryl. So people we use it in the daytime we use it for mild anxiety. Where like a benzodiazepine is not needed. Okay um. Where would you like to go with your treatment now.
8739.0,Patient,What What do you mean by that like I don't.
298.0,Provider,Is there yeah maybe oh I didn't realize you couldn't see me sorry.
8739.0,Patient,"No it's okay. I can see the top, I can see your eyes."
298.0,Provider,"Oh, is there, would you like to try any medication to help, would you like to to just continue to work on therapy."
8739.0,Patient,"um I don't know there's things that I, you know there's. there's things that come up from my past that i'm not happy with and I don't know how to I mean I don't want to live in my past, so I don't know if it's I don't want to talk about it, like I. I don't know what the right thing is to do with that I don't want to go back. But I saw I guess you have to heal for to move forward, I don't know I don't know how that works, but. I don't really want to go dredging through my past, I just want to work on my future well."
298.0,Provider,"There are there is some modes of counseling that says we only need to deal with the here and now we don't need to look at the past, we can move forward from here and now, and do the kind of counseling for that i'm trying to think, let me look it up the name of that type of counseling. Here and now."
8739.0,Patient,"counts, I mean I don't know if I need medication on a regular basis, but I maybe I do I don't I don't know the answer I just think. I mean, sometimes when i'm having like my you know attacks, I guess, I don't know what you want to call them, maybe that would help with me but. I don't know I don't I don't know the right or wrong thing I mean i've been on medication for the past five or six years and and I I was on the tutor for like the last three, maybe even four years and that worked fine for me and."
298.0,Provider,And it may be that you've healed a part of your brain there.
8739.0,Patient,And then I did I did try to come off of it like you know relatively see like I started taking it I tried to come off of it and it didn't work and I went back to taking it. And then I was reading the side effects from it and I literally had like almost every side effects from the tutor so I thought this isn't working. So I don't know I don't know the answer.
298.0,Provider,But you're not taking the lead to do anymore correct.
8739.0,Patient,"No, I stopped when the last time we talked."
298.0,Provider,"i'm more inclined less medication is better if you can, if you can, if if your symptoms don't get to the point where you're overwhelmed by them does that make sense. yeah, and so I like the idea of less medication that thing that I kept them i'm concerned about is your social anxiety um. Would you would you could I give you a name of a medication for you to look up at and think about just. what's needed. purpose propranolol."
8739.0,Patient,"All right, hold on i'm gonna put this in my phone. i'm sorry i'm trying to add a new one and I don't know how Okay, how do you spell that P o"
298.0,Provider,Pro pra and.
8739.0,Patient,hold on.
298.0,Provider,it's P ra n. O program or low else l l. O l O l propranolol.
8739.0,Patient,Pro. Graham oh la Lol. yeah okay yeah.
298.0,Provider,"kind of funny. I use it, I went to my doctor and asked for some propranolol because my anxiety was so high about taking this one exam I needed to take a couple years ago. And so I got the medication and I took it and I felt nothing I like well, maybe it's because i'm not anxious right now. And I didn't want to take the medication, the time of the exam for fear if it made me tired or something so I took the medication with me to the exam. Because my anxiety was starting to raise about the certification and when I got there I started to get anxious and I thought, well, I better make sure i'm. In the right parking lot, so I went into the building and and went looking for the room where I would be taking my exam. And when I got there and open the door they invited me to take the exam right then and there and it bypassed my anxiety and I sat down and I missed my opportunity to try the medication when I had real anxiety, so that was my one almost I got to try it. experience. So. it's meant for us. When we use it for the anxiety side we use it for social type anxiety. And when it's not used for the anxiety it's a blood pressure medication it's used to come the heart rate down and calm. Your pulse down that's the purpose of the propranolol, but we also use it at a lower dose for anxiety."
8739.0,Patient,So okay look.
298.0,Provider,"At it think about it, read what other people say. Another way to treat anxiety is with serotonin type medications. Those would be things like Prozac so loft. If you ever wanted to go down that road, please don't think i'm pushing them."
8739.0,Patient,"Okay yeah I don't know the answer I don't know I mean people tend to tell me, I should be on medications and I don't know if. that's true I don't know so."
298.0,Provider,"um so the name of the therapist that is all about the here and now, is your mom it's why AE l m. and its guests adult therapy and that guest salt is G s ta lt."
8739.0,Patient,And this are these people are bright harder and what.
298.0,Provider,"else it's um i'm sure that there's somebody at bright heart, who can do get stalled therapy, but I just wanted to let you know that there is a line of thinking out there that says we don't need to go into the past two."
8739.0,Patient,"years. Okay, I mean if I do I do, but I don't really um I I have. I had a rough life when I was younger and it's all because of things that I did. chose to do, but now. I don't have that I have a an Okay, you know it's mostly okay i'm mostly good. and But I just don't know what going backwards."
298.0,Provider,yeah.
8739.0,Patient,I want to leave the past in the past and move on.
298.0,Provider,"yeah and it's important that you express that and find a counselor that works with that those parameters. i'm i'm definitely have the opinion you can't pick on my mother. I know that sounds crazy but that's and when i'm doing counseling I set the parameter at the beginning i'm not getting a divorce, no matter how much I talked about my husband i'm not getting a divorce yeah. and setting those parameters has helped me so much over my lifetime of like that's that's where I draw my lines. Anyway, is there anything else, I can help you with."
8739.0,Patient,"um I don't know I guess that's Okay, I will talk, I will come back to the group I missed why I think Oh, I think i'm supposed to come twice a month, but I am. i've been trying to come a little more frequently, but last last this past Friday I had children and get out of school at 1130 and 1145 so it just didn't work for me to come it wasn't and I was in the car during that time."
298.0,Provider,"I like what you said to me, the last time you saw me is i'd like to get to know you better. Like i'd like you know me better."
8739.0,Patient,"yeah I just I mean I feel like well yeah you're prescribing medications and I don't even know I mean I asked you last time what my diagnosis was and I don't you i'd never had really I had heard of the bipolar thing before, but I didn't really understand what that. What that was so um. And I didn't look that up, but the ptsd I have no idea what that would even I don't know."
298.0,Provider,And I don't know why that was written down there but i'm glad that I feel like. Mistakes can happen and it's good for you to check your diagnosis and they will change over time you've gotten six years away from your history of substance abuse. awesome I gotta go i'll talk to you later okay.
8739.0,Patient,"Okay, thank you."
298.0,Provider,Thank you bye bye bye. Hello. Okay.
