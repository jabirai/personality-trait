15251.0,Patient,doing good.
289.0,Provider,So tell me what brought you here today and what you're looking for.
15251.0,Patient,"So basically I have been kind of off and on drinking, probably for. Pretty solid six months and not really I wouldn't say i'm getting drunk every day, but I definitely have been getting drunk probably at least once a month I would that's basically around where it's at right now. haven't had a drink, since I think the seventh. The seventh of this month. No drinking, no, no smoking since then. Basically, ended up having on blow up at work. As date basically drinking at work, and then I blew up on on a couple of employees there and just kind of kind of lost it and then went home did the same thing kind of lost it uh and my son's football practice and. So basically from there, my wife sat down and said, you know kind of enough of this where we're headed right, so we decided to try something different than we haven't tried to in our lives before So this was it."
289.0,Provider,"Oh yeah it sounds like a really good time to do that and have you, as you said that you've only been here for like six months."
15251.0,Patient,"Oh no, no, no, like like like serious like it been struggling with drinking, probably for about six months now um I used to not I spent probably maybe. Good five to eight years, and not drinking at all, I was sober when I was younger quit drinking, probably in my mid 20s. And then just picked it up just because I didn't think it was an issue anymore, and someone kind of digging here and there, and then, but again I you know it's it started getting pretty bad, I guess, with everything going on right now it's kind of. kind of put me kind of in a corner or something like that so so here I am trying to get back to sobriety the way it used to be for me. A lot of my issues really are since everyone it's so easy for everyone to drink because it's first it's legal. And no one else really has an issue with it and I didn't think I had an issue with it before but, but now I know that I do I can't I can't casually drink with. without stopping basically it just gets it'll progress more and more whether it's daily or weekly so i'm just at the point now where I need to stop and. Basically, just whatever my wife, you know thinks that we should do that's what kind of what we're doing there's a part of it, the physical side of it."
289.0,Provider,"Okay yeah um and can you tell me, and maybe right before you quit how much you are drinking."
15251.0,Patient,"um it wasn't daily sporadic, but when I did drink I probably would drink at least a pint of whiskey, at least in a pint of whiskey would barely barely give me a buzz so my tolerance has always been pretty high for it and. So if I was if I was sitting down and being. Diplomatic with my wife about it, I would just drink beer, because she and I both knew that was going to do anything but when I would drink alcohol, I would make it would just kind of numb me calm me down from the stresses of the day at work, I managed to to shops to stores basically. So and. One of the issues for me really was that I never really wanted to open a second store I enjoyed it's a family run business. turn with family family and friends, so I enjoyed the brotherhood of having all my you know, basically, my friends, and my family together in one spot and. That opening up another shop, I came from a corporate background, so I knew for me, my concern was always this is going down a corporate way I don't want to do this, I really I mean I left corporate because I don't want this type of life. I just wanted to be with the people that you know were supportive and everything, but now I feel like we're getting split up so that was on top of everything else is kind of dragging me down with that. I didn't really want to do that, I just wanted to stay where we're at, and I was surprised and happy with what we're doing, but of course everyone else wants to progress and want to make more money because we live in the Bay area and all that stuff but I was satisfied, where I was at. yeah so i've since since then, on Friday. So I spent a couple of days, where I said i'm leaving you know I basically first couple even my wife said it's time to go leave this place, you know you. you've struggled with this before you know and it's not because of my drinking it's just a part of part of the issue, so we had decided you're leaving i'm leaving let's just go find some you know something else for you to do. This job is stressful job they return on into, and so a couple of days ago I sat down, I was finally clear or I wasn't mad or I wasn't anything and I sat down with. With my ownership and told him this is where I was at before I don't think i'm there right now I think i'm willing to listen, but more than anything else, I want you guys to listen to me. I want you guys to hear what I have to say why i'm struggling with these things and i'm not saying you're going to change anything, I just want you to understand you know understand where i'm at. So that's kind of where it's at right now we're in a good, you know i'm going to get place her and I right now, or out i'm out of town at a retreat for our children do they have we have a kids retreat right now so. So that that'll start about nine, but so we're doing that, right now, and just they have given me all the time off i'd want. To re Center myself, so I haven't been at work, since the 70s and it's all paid top paid time off and, at the end of this week i'll meet with them again and see where we're at and see if. If I am going to stay or if i'm not going to stay, but just more conversations about the things you know they want to know more about what I have been thinking. i'm usually an outspoken person, obviously I won't stop talking but. Music outspoken put the reality is i've been keeping all that stuff inside because I thought, if I had said anything that I would be the guy who was D railing with everyone else wants to do. But I never I mean for these past five years i've never wanted to go down this route, but i've just never said anything because I didn't want to. I didn't want to be how I used to be, I was very confrontational in the past, and I just didn't want to be that I just I just went along for the ride and happy or not happy."
289.0,Provider,"Okay yeah well i'm glad you it sounds like you're kind of on track to kind of explore that and kind of figure out, basically, what makes you happy, so that it doesn't add to your job, and while you're in recovery. Last time you stopped drinking you did you just also quit cold Turkey."
15251.0,Patient,"I quit cold Turkey, just like this time, so I did a detox at home by myself and it wasn't fun last time and it definitely wasn't fun, this time, but that's kind of how stubborn I am instead of admitting myself I just said i'm just going to do this right now done kind of thing. And that last time was for me was actually was a spiritual thing, so I. I joined I joined a church at the time, and just something that told me it's time to move on from this, and I just stopped cold Turkey, and I was probably been like I said, probably eight eight to 10 years I went without drinking online. and It would have been fine, but you know I said outside influence which was within my own family was the whole. You know what's the big deal if you have a drink kind of thing, and so, anyone who doesn't have a drinking problem doesn't think it's a big deal. Now I realized, it is a big deal because I never thought alcoholism was a thing until I realized, well, here I am again with no control what's going on and I realized Okay, I do have a problem. So the problem, the thing is erase this problem, I may have other issues for sure, but the drinking with the dragon in the middle there's no dealing with any other issues that was my way of dealing."
289.0,Provider,yeah and when you stop what happened.
15251.0,Patient,When miss.
289.0,Provider,Any did anything happened.
15251.0,Patient,"This last time. Oh yeah yeah yeah I had withdrawals I had I was shaking. I was sweating for at least two days straight and. Then for sure, like the feeling of I got have a drink but but I haven't had it since i'm gonna have to since then."
289.0,Provider,I.
15251.0,Patient,"feel good, I feel I feel pretty clear I feel like I can make a decision and not be. Not being some haze you know about it, they have a conversation my wife i'm going to remember it in the morning, you know i'm gonna have a conversation with someone so. I mean all that stuff obviously with clarity comes you know hindsight is 2020 we look back on what are you doing but that's kind of where it's at right now I don't really have any guilt. I have probably some guilt during the detoxing probably three four days but. At this point. i'm pretty i'm pretty solid in that just trying to deal with the issues that have caused me to get to the point where I don't want to be sober."
289.0,Provider,"Okay yeah i'm like you definitely thought. So what do you what would you like to do um, I guess, my question is, do you want. To continue. Without any medication and just say cold Turkey or you feel like this time you're going to need the medication they'll."
15251.0,Patient,"Probably if you. Honestly, it doesn't I don't think it matters what I think because of the point where i've gotten to again, I had no intention to stop start drinking again. I think one thing I mentioned to my wife and she would probably encourages is apparently there's something you can take that deters you from even wanting it. for a period of time. we're making it even horrible for you, if you do. I think that might be a good sound decision, at least for a little while you know where I can condition myself to. Forget about that you know I did the other day, think about a cigarette and I was like hey man like I don't want to smoke cigarettes and but but, again, of course, it's yeah I I think for maybe a little while, at the turn of of that medication would probably help a little bit. Of course, if I go back to work, where I am working I would definitely need the medication because, like I said every every all the boys drink beer all the time, you know, I have to work and. All that crap and then talk about it so for me, yes, it would physically know the stimulus would be great tonight even think about okay."
289.0,Provider,"Okay yeah there are a couple things that are possible, I think the one your wife might be talking about is called interviews or, as I sell for him and that's the one where you take one today and that might be good for you, because. you're working with your family on this, so you can have them help you and say hey i'm going to take this medicine, every day, you can watch me so that you know i'm working on it. And yes, it causes a reaction in your body, so that if you drink any alcohol, you will feel really sick, so it stops you from wanting to drink or, if you do drink it you won't regret it. Just one option. Another option would be maybe something called net truck stone and that doesn't really stop you from drinking, but it decreases your cravings so you're not really as interested as much so that's another option to that's also a daily meditation. Some people even do both. depending on where you're at in your recovery. But those are some options for you to use, I think you said you smoke cigarettes, do you use any other drugs."
15251.0,Patient,doesn't know.
289.0,Provider,To take any medication.
15251.0,Patient,No.
289.0,Provider,"Okay okay so that's good, then we could probably do it either or. Do you have a preference."
15251.0,Patient,not really I just think whatever works for this particular situation i'm good with.
289.0,Provider,"yeah um. I think I would recommend either to interview someone that makes you sick every day or combine it or both, I think those would be. What I would suggest. I guess it's really up to do you want to take one or two."
15251.0,Patient,"You know it, it doesn't matter to me, I mean I can do both it's no big deal once once I get started on the Richmond i'm pretty good about saying."
289.0,Provider,"hey how about do you have a lot of craving so now, if you think about alcohol. When you're not."
15251.0,Patient,i'm sorry I missed. I missed a break just send me a text sorry.
289.0,Provider,"Oh Okay, and if you're not at work and people aren't talking about alcohol, do you have any cravings."
15251.0,Patient,"I haven't I haven't since then I. think probably my My biggest concern is being around people who are drinking alcohol yeah I mean, like last night, we were at a friend's house and they were they were drinking whiskey and coke and didn't bother me one bit, but they were doing that. yeah."
289.0,Provider,"Maybe then we can just start with one medicine. With the end to be. awesome call dice on Prem. And that's the one you will not feel good if you drink. And so that we can just start at one today, I recommend it we're not recommend taking it once in the morning also like I said it is additionally helpful if you. have someone to collaborate with and say hey i'm taking this medicine watch me go."
15251.0,Patient,To kind of keep you accountable to.
289.0,Provider,"That do you think your wife would be on board with that. yeah so let's try that you can let me know how it goes, and if you need like additional help for cravings you can add on yet medicine later. yeah so you just basically have to be careful about drinking, because the side effects, as you can. And I was doing ocean healthy."
15251.0,Patient,"As far as I know I get checkups like blood work done as far as I know him well I know they just did a bunch of bloodwork just recently. For you guys, so I don't know what's coming to that, but the last time I checked that wasn't diabetic I wasn't I didn't have anything that that I was shown couple years ago when I got blood work done."
289.0,Provider,"Okay, good yeah all right um do you have any questions for me."
15251.0,Patient,"Probably I guess the question is, is where. Where do we where, am I going to go from here, am I going to go back to the. The folks back at that the health place and i'm going to be basically meeting with someone once a week or does this Is it based on this meeting, right here."
289.0,Provider,"Good question, so what happens, a specific like your initial intake appointment and and then how we do refill is every week, we have you come to a group meeting and that's where they do be so. So the first part of each group meeting is like just one of the providers and we check in with you and. seizure medication okay. How you doing and then do the refill. And then the second part is it's like a group therapy session all together on right heart, just like this. And then, on top of that, we do require you to have one on one individual therapy, also with one of the therapist sometimes it's the same therapist in the group therapy equipment, sometimes it's different depending on your schedule. And then also they probably explain to you, but also the lab and urine checks every so often and then surveys every so often. yeah but also like we could also mean outside of the group meetings, if we need to adjust your medications are checking or something like that, just like a one on one meeting. And, and they think they will, after this i'll contact you to like go through it again and kind of in more detail how to do that. And then they'll assign it to a group meeting and if with me it's Wednesday afternoon and so you're welcome to join those and, but it also is also just really depending on what your schedule is but."
15251.0,Patient,To have a consistent.
289.0,Provider,"Meeting, no matter what your time. See. Some yeah man, you can always call us to the virtual clinic if you have any question. And let us know. Does that answer let's. See Oh, you know I get to ask you, do you have any family history that I need to know about. Like anything running in your family."
15251.0,Patient,"I think there's. These runs in my family i'm playing high blood pressure, runs in my family. Cancer seems run in our family pretty good so quite a few underlying things yeah so most of most of my family is overweight and obese most of my family's."
289.0,Provider,"quit alcohol to you, so that. It can take that load off your body and and you have a primary care providers."
15251.0,Patient,We do have a primary care with. My wives yeah through my wife's insurance okay.
289.0,Provider,"yeah and i'm glad you have a lot of support so that's good. let's see alright, so I think I got all the information I need just send your medication later today when I get to the your pharmacy. And then, so the next time we will see you for a prescription is like when we have you back for group but because this isn't me a medication, if you want, we can also set up a one on one appointments check in before that in a few days. Do you want to do that, or you feel pretty comfortable to feel like you can wait, maybe a week or so."
15251.0,Patient,yeah I can probably wait about a week or so.
289.0,Provider,Okay yeah so let's talk to you come back to one thing and then check in to see have a skeleton.
