740.0,Provider,Do you see. My block okay all right all right roughly roughly.
14272.0,Patient,"roughly four days and then. And then I ended up calling them and he answer and we kind of talked and it kind of seemed like you know we were doing better. um. And then the day of his mom's funeral he kind of like disappeared again, and the next day it was just funny so at that point, I was just kind of like my emotions were just kind of like i'm done and I just fell over it. So then, of course, the very next day he calls me like nothing ever happening. Now I mean he's been he's been reaching out every day. And he just like nothing ever happened."
740.0,Provider,So you won't you won't keep playing this one.
14272.0,Patient,"I feel like i'm over it, you know."
740.0,Provider,That you know. You know.
14272.0,Patient,"yeah i'm just i'm. You know, I was asking myself like Why do I feel like Oh, people are like Why do I, like Why do I identify myself with being. Like I want to say, like a loyal person."
740.0,Provider,mm hmm.
14272.0,Patient,"And I was kind of thinking about like how we talked about my brother, he was telling me how like I had like i've been protecting someone who victimized me."
740.0,Provider,mm hmm.
14272.0,Patient,And I was just kind of wondering if there is like a pattern. of mine.
740.0,Provider,mm hmm.
14272.0,Patient,"So, with that in mind i'm i'm i'm very conscience conscious of. what's going on and I don't I don't I don't feel the need to to to just block out like I don't feel. Like that's something that I have to do. But I do get how I could be better protection myself if I be. So i'm kind of struggling with the blood i'm definitely in a place where i'm over the situation like I feel like the whole even like the no title thing like I feel like that whole thing is, but nice me. And I don't even know why I. Was plan with that in the first place, because. Like that's the only word I can think of it's like it's beneath me I don't even know. Why, I was accepting that so i'm definitely past that. and And the way he treated me during the last two weeks and I really don't know why it was really weird but. The way I describe it is, I feel like I feel like he stumped on me for like the last two weeks. You know. and He didn't invite me to the funeral which are I didn't want to go anyway, but I didn't even feel welcome you know what I mean like I didn't feel I didn't I didn't feel welcome at all. And it's like if you're if his mom was here, and she was throwing her own funeral she would have invited me, you know. I really understand that, but I mean he kind of he kind of he kind of told me he didn't want he wasn't comfortable bringing me around his family, because of some stuff in the past, where he. He brought a girl around and she was the wrong one, so I just feel like you got all these fears and excuses and. Whatever. yeah."
740.0,Provider,"Okay, what you want me to start."
14272.0,Patient,here.

You are a savior basically to your brother. Yes, it is a pattern i'm wondering if it's a pattern, yes, it is a pattern right you don't have to wonder this pattern, you know it's a better. Because it seems like now. You are attracted to projects."

740.0,Provider,And once that happens bandwidth.
14272.0,Patient,"So I did that, and I mean we have more conversation, but I never it wasn't like an apology was just an excuse, I mean basically he said he he wasn't trying to disrespect me he was just telling me how he felt. So."
740.0,Provider,"But no one he never says, I. So after that we was like okay. We got a bad guy the bad guy. And without the better."

740.0,Provider,My do things in that plan.
14272.0,Patient,"it's not easy, sometimes it works for me, sometimes they don't."
740.0,Provider,"So the expert, so let me ask you this man, the expectation. From you doing that. was what."
14272.0,Patient,"I just want a relief. On I don't I don't necessarily think I did it for him, for us, I think it was just like I had I just needed. I needed a I needed a break like that, no matter what I did like I was exercising I was listening to podcast I was busy I was at work, but it was like, no matter what i'd be like I just could not I couldn't think about nothing else so. I just needed I just needed to say what I had to ask felt like I just needed to say what I have to say, and then I will feel better and. I did. Okay, I did feel better I felt better and then you know. We were communicating more. I felt like okay he's just mad he'll get over it whatever, but it was just like. It went from that to me just not being sure. So I just got tired I just got tired to get my feelings hurt."
740.0,Provider,mm hmm.
14272.0,Patient,"So the last time when. I feel like we were communicating we were doing better. And then, like I said then, you know the day of his mom's funeral but he was calling me like he caught me crying just telling me how he felt he called he went to her. Her weight, you know her viewing her, and he called me and was like you know, like i'm literally looking at my mom right now in this don't look like her, like I don't know who this late like he was calling me and so i'm just like okay we're we're communicating we're doing better. And then the day of his mom's funeral he just you know, and I know he had a lot of family and stuff but it's like he got weird again. And it was like that the day of in the day after, and then I text him I said, are you Okay, because I hadn't talked to him. And he said yeah i'm good, so I just left it alone at that point, I was just like okay he's good i'm tired of getting my feelings hurt i'm over it, and. went the rest of that day, not worried about him like in a whole nother space mind clear the very next day, I went that day and I left my phone and apart, a day and went to work, and when I when I got out he has sent me a picture. And you not told you, I do nail, so it was like a picture of some meals that look crazy i'm just like Okay, whatever. So. Then the next day. He caught me in the morning and that's like usually, when he calls me like first thing in the morning. So he called me in the morning, so I answered, and he was just talking about his mom he was saying he he hadn't had a chance to grieve and he was just talking like like met them happy like it was just it was so weird and i'm just like. And i'm in my head like do I tell them how I feel do I even care, am I really done does it even matter, so I just was like you know what imma just be your friend i'm gonna just be a friend, so I just let them talk. And then I got off the phone with him, and then we had another conversation later on, and I was just literally just in France, all and. And then yesterday Sunday, I was off, I was in bed all day and I was just minding my own business. And then. And then he takes me and actually how's he doing, he said it it's been rough I think crying all day and I said, do you want to call me and he said no it's Okay, and I said okay with you. If you need to call me i'm here. And he didn't say much so I was like well there I am with them read again, and at that point. Oh right like you don't even hurt my feelings no i'm just whatever. So um so i'll leave it alone and then. He text me now he called me today this morning and was like cuz it's empty begs him knees like they like cookie or brownie thingies I don't know she made them up, but they held a good so she he caught me was like yeah my teammate them they nomos you like you want me to bring."

We just."
740.0,Provider,When is it where. Is it not with mad.
14272.0,Patient,you're sitting is.
740.0,Provider,"Not wondering why, could you still answering the phone. This is about favorite. worship i'm. Just kidding but."
14272.0,Patient,I didn't even hear you.
740.0,Provider,But i'm. So. Most of the interactions you make them first.
14272.0,Patient,I will yeah now i'm not at all.
740.0,Provider,"And, but that's The thing is that most of it interesting you make them. And you know."
14272.0,Patient,What.
740.0,Provider,That means that you're pursuing him. was missing data for see you.
14272.0,Patient,we're.
740.0,Provider,"gonna say you. live on the thing i'm gonna give you i'm using here just a little bit just a little bit okay. Now, if you want a successful relationship and you want to see a man really wants to be you have to let him pursue. You want to see that i'm paying for it rip out. When I first met my husband before here in my husband, we were just friends did you know, for the first six months, I never caught him first. He was like I know it's just a normal job. But see if I missed the content from our polycom base other day, and I would never found him first, and the reason why I did, that is because of the fake I wanted to see if he was really going to visit me. You can be the one pursuing him, and then you end up getting you end up with your face on the flow."
14272.0,Patient,"i'm good at, I know that I just got caught up in the whole like I was really grieving the loss of his mom too, so I was a I was an emotional wreck like I was literally. separately crying about hurt and hurt behind him like it was a lot on me it wasn't just it wasn't just him. And I wanted to be there for him, so it was a it was just a lot on me and like I said I struggle with you know wanting to be there for people so, for me it was just it was just a lot on me, but I feel like I went through wait, I feel like I learned from it. I never I never pursue anybody, and I, and I have, I have a friend like that I mentioned to you last time he's been around for he's been around for like seven years. Now, not only when physically. I wasn't i'm not physically attracted to him, but. But he didn't he lasted longer than everybody else, I mean he's still around and. And because of him, I know the difference. You. know what I mean so like I have a lot of respect for him and he's always there when I need him and I don't do anything with him or anything like that so. So, because of him, I do know the difference."
740.0,Provider,going.
14272.0,Patient,"On I was just gonna say and and i'm past that um you know that that last message I sent him when he when he faked you know he ignored my call, but I text him I said, are you Okay, and he said you i'm good that was like that was it for me. That wasn't for me and then I started thinking about what we talked about with my brother and it's just all kind of making sense for me so it's just like i'm really in a different really in a different mindset right now. And the only reason why you're you're sensing that it may not be over is because. Because i'm still answering the phone like you said but i'm not i'm not i'm not gonna play the same game when."
740.0,Provider,You shouldn't answer the phone. You shouldn't respond it.
14272.0,Patient,You.
740.0,Provider,"i'm gonna play some. games and play badminton does you have an incident that we used to be. I mean you know when I was kid right, it was on my favorite thing right playing super Mario. was great. And being you know what happened, you got. This. Again, what happens when you die when it was also it was over, he didn't carry your coins over from what you collect that you had to fall back on. So when something's all within these is over, no, there was no residue remember when once your senses Mario and they they made you restart the level you don't have the same mushroom. You to have the same colon. You remember you would be because you got your mushroom know when you start getting you back one you bet small again because you have to do it all over again right because whatever you did in the last game, when he was already gave you the same game over riverside gave. What in all of her. Then means any trace of what was there before is done. Dear because it makes me. anytime I didn't get my phone calls when I thought of the game oh. marshmallow one animal."
14272.0,Patient,Very right.
740.0,Provider,"There was no there was literally no residue. That I have previously from from when I free to play the game. When I started a new day. Everything was everything was brand new. At the do it all over again. You know what happens is that every time you say that is over. When you pick up the phone. Every time you say those will. Be testing day. They use it well you know what i'm just gonna be a free. Yes, i'm really. Good about. Where you know when and what we do is would justify and will say stuff like i'm gonna be afraid to continue to give us reasons to pick up the phone. When I just listened to him in the frame. But the thing about it is. That for you."
14272.0,Patient,it's true.
740.0,Provider,"If that told you, I think I told you that laughter I don't know if I did or not, but I think today. You can't keep be convenient. Because if you if you're always convenient. Then, a man knows that he won't have to pursue. You gotta give them some to chase. It may say, if you can't be you can't always be coming. Now, and that's the thing because because of my injury. codependency is not just when you're dependent on others, but codependency is also that you like, when people depend on you."
14272.0,Patient,mm hmm.
740.0,Provider,Is wanting to feel wanted and needing to see are needed.
14272.0,Patient,In order codependency.
740.0,Provider,"So what do you do you put yourself in the way. so that you can see a need. Or you put yourself in the way so that you can see a warning. He keeping you all rate and you can send a text message like Oh well, you know if you need anything just let me know i'm here, no you're not here. You know. Frankly, hope all goes well with. grace and peace my there. But. We gotta tackle that they're needing to so needed. that's the thing that's what the superhero the savior mentality comes from needing to feel needed. You know i'm saying and the thing about it is just because you have an example and you really think like you have a great example of a friendship that you've had for seven years. You i'm saying, but apparently we know that is not enough, why. Because of the fact. I need to do meeting. My time we don't like when things come easy. You don't want stuff comes to easy then it's like novel so I didn't realize my mouth. On the wealthiest I didn't have to work their whole for like I can maybe. But do you know something to me. It really does something God is a God thing. you're saying, but here we go. Out there won't get out. of it. Was Have you ever heard that analogy is a story of a man, he was jamming water. If they got a."
14272.0,Patient,know the boats.
740.0,Provider,"manual I are now our we got inside. The theater and lowest at. The next in the machine and now on in my head and I wonder what it looks like there's a long time so malakal a rescue helicopter you need to have. Our alerting me and I voted no. I actually designed us, I sent you about. The conference and see the thing is about the the thing about it is we say like I said everything something's really do come easy. But see when you are needing to feel needed. Then you wouldn't neglect that which come easy and saying that that's not for me. And then you'll take on the project because why, because at least it will fulfill my needs to be neat."
14272.0,Patient,"huh. i've been reading about codependency lately, and that was the one thing I. didn't have like i'm like. I was like I was like maybe that sounds like maybe I could. be dealing with that, but then, when they said that part I was like. nah but."
740.0,Provider,"Oh. that's the thing it's not all about you dependent on somebody else no but it's also about needing to do need it. And that's why I like to break it down like that. Because a lot of times, a lot of times people feel like. They they codependency just one side is not. Right, because the thing about it is, is that a lot of times we a lot of times you can be. Not just not caught up in on people doing things for you, but yours is the flip side you like to do things that other people. But what do you do you put your assessment away. You you keep collecting project. Keep data like this, you got to be a superhero in at the end of the day, you'd one game. Now, what do you probably."
14272.0,Patient,"will make sense I just think that, for some reason our process certain situations as times when you supposed to. take shape. Why, I don't know."
740.0,Provider,Okay. So what i'm a every America in real life.
14272.0,Patient,mm hmm.
740.0,Provider,"So there's something that I have to take within moments. within the confines of morale and values and things like that, but within a contract within the confines of compromise, like, for example. If I want brom Emma has a wall kfc, then we have something you just deal with. It my husband, you know if I want to go out to dinner but wasn't one of those has drag race. along. With flows. And I will put you up or you know something to me, you know the small things they're not compromising thing, there are small things like me me me me wiping down the urban don't does not compromise my integrity. me washing dishes. That doesn't compromise, who I am. But me justify myself, I mean I just love me reducing myself. To be. Somebody option. know that compromises my intake. expressive I know what i'm worth. It on value to. Now we reduce our fail. To be somebody has option. Maybe they either they can you know, making me with you live without. And that's a reduction. that's the compromise nap now listen. there's something something. When it comes to compromising your morals your values your work, your self esteem your integrity. There are no they don't go in reverse a wise idea with this person. Who says it. Will you read that it. Add."
14272.0,Patient,"I mean. I guess I didn't I guess I didn't know that I was doing that because i've done it in the past, and I think that. I think that i've realized the might. have realized it and that's why i'm where I am now like, even just having with the realization that the whole situation is beneath me like. I don't even know why you know I don't even know why we went along with it in the first place."
740.0,Provider,"that's what I want to know, I really want you to take this week. really do I really want you to take this week. And I want you to tell me, I want you to lie down. and tell me. Why. You feel like you have to go alone again tomorrow. My, why was the hartfield ago. Even though every side pointing to a basis. And even now, I still love you later. OK. OK, and now that was off your chest, and as you feel good, then why we still around. Could you say you unblocking for the purpose of saying what you need to say. So you say what you need to say. He did not apologize. You said you felt that you need to say so, that means that was your release. So you really you feel better was."
14272.0,Patient,"Having like I said and I was just telling myself that you know, I was going to be a friend, because I still have this complex about. sticking to my word or you know I just."
740.0,Provider,"watching what was your What was your worry, you made a word, you have made a word that you won't be afraid."
14272.0,Patient,Just hit the call me if you need to talk.
740.0,Provider,"that's an option, then aware. As an option, you say you can call me if you see the word is used as an option that means I can either call you, that means you can either call me or you don't have to."
14272.0,Patient,"But, but I feel like that's mom answering the phone."
740.0,Provider,"that's an option. The same will you tell him, you can call it, you need to have the same way, you can tell yourself I call a man I answer if I want to."
14272.0,Patient,work.
740.0,Provider,it's an option.
14272.0,Patient,that's true.
740.0,Provider,"there's not a it's Not a word. You just saved, it was a word. so that you can stay in this man's life. in some way that was."
14272.0,Patient,"that's how I was thinking, but I haven't been wanting to talk and i've just been answering because for me i'm keeping my word that's how. i'm telling you. I mean. Sometimes you just need somebody to give you a different perspective. Okay, and so, with that with with the perspective, you give me it helps but that's i'm just telling you how my thought."
740.0,Provider,"My thought probably i'm saying show me i'm not. i'm not going i'm not beating you up at all, I just want you to see it. I want you to see you're not bound by word. Because it's an option you're not the only person that he can talk to. Which means he chooses to talk to you if no one has answered the phone. How do you know what actually you are, are you option one or your option I. See you are but you're an option. And that's what you put yourself here, when you say so as well you know if you needed to know that's an option, because the thing about it is he knows he can call me."
14272.0,Patient,mm hmm.
740.0,Provider,"So you, thank you, thank you, his first option absolutely man come on that me not them as far as options. That. They. You know, you know you know that you're right."
14272.0,Patient,I don't really I don't I don't really care like I don't really think about that type of stuff.
740.0,Provider,"You should. I should, and all the reason why I say that you should so that you can understand. That you should be the first option actually you shouldn't be an obstinate all. Right, they have a saying that says slavery, to train me hundred on Labor rather Mitch. i'm either gonna put me on again or trying to to another thing. i'm too i'm too good. To be a benchwarmer. And the thing about it is, and you know you're the woman yeah these things you know you have a lot to offer you don't if. So if you notice anything reducing yourself to people. Who cannot acknowledge what they have. If. If some out of it, you, we cannot acknowledge. The treasury that they today. Thank you know, then, then, then I work full time. You have to let go of being a project manager. managing these projects. In like you have to be a hero to people. You can be your hero. You really you really should."
14272.0,Patient,"I am. I making a lot of progress, I know I know I know it still sounds crazy but."
740.0,Provider,"You know, it sounds crazy. I mean, I mean it's normal these things happening and. Then we didn't get had when when you most of your time I mean it's normal we've all been through what i've been doing. So yeah it's not it's not unrealistic but. At the same time it's one of those things. So where you got to cut the cord. You gotta cut it completely. The text that you sent him when you say you can call me if you mean that's an option. Like it was the word, then you know what. You have the right to change in. my mind. You have the right to change your life. What do you say to them at all, or is it more where you turn them out about your athletes. Because no matter what shoes, should I wear. or music or music or what are you gonna listen to you tell me, you could change your mind about all those things you can even change your mind about what you want to eat, so you can change them out about all those things, but you can change your mind about about assessments. You can change your mind."
14272.0,Patient,On on my room I came from. I don't know where that came from.
740.0,Provider,"Okay, but you can change your mind we've even got to know where it came from, but just know you can change your mind. You can you can change your mind once you're married Of course not. In situations like these. When the person has shown you that anyone wants you. He did just convenient to them. it's sickening, of course. Which is not hailed by anything. at all. So. Before we get off I don't I don't know my fork I can show you if someone. asks you about the last piece, for having going with the Attorney and the daughter, and then. Okay."
14272.0,Patient,"So the last time I reached out to the Attorney I think I told you, they said they would call me back they never called me back. Her dad has been at least answering the phone on the scheduled times that the Court has which is Sunday at teen and Tuesday at four. So if I still feel like I need more. Consistent communication. But. I haven't been focused on be honest like this, this the last two weeks I haven't i've been trying to juggle everything and handle my business and everything but. I haven't been my in my daughter my daughter she just went to her dad's House on Thursday so she was with me for most of that time so. I have any event it hasn't been like I told you last time it hasn't been stressing me out as much as it was before we had that conversation, so it kind of went from like red to like. orange like yellow or you know it's not like. it's not like killing me nowhere like it was before. But I definitely still want to. want to do something i'm just trying to i'm trying to figure out exactly what, though, because I go back and forth because it's like when she when he has her like it does help it does help me i'm able to get a lot done, and you know it does take some of the weight off of me. yeah but then this is the is really the communication part and just the fact that I can't just text her when i'm thinking about it, or you know just see what she doing or see what she ate or see how she feeling, you know. yeah so it's like the last time I talked to where she.
