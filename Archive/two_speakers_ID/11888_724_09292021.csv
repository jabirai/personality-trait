11888.0,Patient,"It helps with the kids my sister is in Midland Texas, and she has she worked for energy company and since coven she's been working from home."
724.0,Provider,"yeah that's probably going to be the move for a lot of a lot of people. They find that people are actually more efficient working from home, you know, because if you're going to work eight hours or 10 hours, whatever it is. They have the luxury of doing that, like at their own pace, you know you can spend more time with the kids and not rushing around there's no. You know grab ass at work with co workers, and you know stuff like that so it's it's actually more efficient like I I show up I do what I have to do, I get off and I go. spend time with my kids come back on do what I gotta do it often spend more time my kids clean up the House, you know what I mean so it's i'm getting more. I find it more efficient i'm getting like more out of my day multitasking and stuff like that so it's good. that's probably."
11888.0,Patient,What the fans you ever had. Have you ever had problems with substances.
724.0,Provider,"nope nope I had problems with. martial arts so like many addictions right so so like addiction like by definition is like doing something. or an activity that is inherently bad for you, but you do it anyways right because it's hijacking your dopamine reward system so. you're chasing the thing that makes you feel good all the time, some people do with gambling, some people do it SEC, some people do it with drug some people do skydiving they were adrenaline junkies. There always chasing that hive so whatever that that poison is for you and we all got it we're all. We all predisposed to having some kind of hang up some people find it fairly early on and that's what drugs and alcohol and some people find it later I found that with. marginalized violence, and so I did jujitsu for. A while and It made me feel good I loved it I connected with people. But I got injured and despite being significantly injured I kept going and I made it worse, and I made it worse than I made it got to finally got to the point to where. i've suffered long term consequences from that from that like that injury and you know when I was in it, all I could think about jujitsu like all I could think of like I bought books it preoccupied a lot of my time like I was really, really like really into it. i'm going to work with like black eyes and stuff like that, like I like it didn't matter, it was. I was really, really into it, but I felt good, and it was like paying off um it's just unfortunate that, like I suffered a pretty significant neck injury and it cause nerve damage and all that kind of good stuff. So, so I when I tell when people ask you that it's like yeah of course i've done drugs i've drank alcohol is in the military slowly like drinking alcohol is like a. favorite pastime for people, as in the military because they can't do drugs, so what they can do is i'll call and they do it well. So I know I got all these spirits in the world with drugs and alcohol, I worked in restaurants growing up, so I got a master's levels, education and. How to use drugs, how to procure drugs, I was a cop in the military, so I was like well versed with you know the world. In which that that operates, and it just wasn't for me like I can do a lot of that stuff it just I never allowed to really consume like a my life jujitsu was that for me. So I tell people that was my That was my drug of choice. And despite all all the things that i've been through all the other things that I have. There are days, where I feel good and i'm like man I wish I could go back and do it, and I think about doing it and then i'm like well I don't want to be paralyzed right so it's like I was gonna like weigh the pros and cons. But, just like anybody else had struggles with addiction like I always have that pool because i'm a gobby I chase at dragon one more time, you know what I mean so like I get it it's is in my my world my drug of choice is different than what I do as an occupation that makes sense."
11888.0,Patient,"So yeah makes a lot of sense and i'm I don't really um I I could say i'm an alcoholic but it's more like. I have an addictive personality and I think we all do we're all prone to. To getting a there's a name for it but uh you know just like you go by starbucks in the morning and the line comes out into the street. That coffee, I mean. It doesn't matter really what it is like you said. Some people are overeaters. So I just. What what, what can I do to. To put it put it, a rest it and I found for me it's a train. I don't even get thoughts to drink anymore, when I used to get a thought then I just go do it. But I don't get thoughts anymore, and I pray and. I think the praying good work, even for. martial arts do I, I did kimbo karate a long time ago, when I was a kid my brother's does did. and his son did. karate karate I guess. Anyway, I know he's a black belt, but um. he's into. You know he has his job and stuff so he, I guess, he did that just for self Defense yeah. yeah I think anything. huh."
