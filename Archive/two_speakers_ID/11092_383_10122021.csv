383.0,Provider,"Good. Did you. In terms of. Our last appointment, you mentioned that you were still. sort of been troubled with hearing the auditory hallucinations and was wondering how how you were doing with that right now."
11092.0,Patient,it's better. it's better so from coping with it and. it's just improved a lot since our last one.
383.0,Provider,"Okay, good and what, what do you think has contributed to the improvements."
11092.0,Patient,"Just. be mindful what i'm doing at the present so from Washington car or plan with my son. Just yeah I really just helps to. Ease those executive tensions and. yeah it's just been better that way, I think so."
383.0,Provider,"So i'm really bringing yourself into the present moment and. Yes, yeah. So that's great, and that is such a it's a really freeing practice to just also deal with. You no worries stresses. is to hone in on this on this present moment. And you were mentioning you really like doing the DIY. thing was then. which gives us a great opportunity to to just do something, you know in this moment fix something, and these are the parts, and these are the pieces, and this is what needs to go together and."
11092.0,Patient,not sure I mean I agree it's really good.
383.0,Provider,"that's good. So how about the communication piece with your family, as you mentioned in the group do you want to talk about that a little bit and disappointment, or what would you like to. discuss in your appointment in your time."
11092.0,Patient,"Well, the communication is it's improved. This better communication just really stepping back and. Finding the right words to say and. Just communicating a very clear, concise and to the point matter. helps a lot with. not discussing these are irrelevant so. that's that's that's where. it's getting better."
383.0,Provider,"Okay, good, how was it before what did you struggle with in the past."
11092.0,Patient,"Just. Now, not hearing the. person that really hearing that when they talk to me so. Once I. step back to listen that changed the whole dynamic when communicating two words."
383.0,Provider,"yeah that's that's great um did you come to that awareness or did your family, you know kind of point that out, or how did, how did you come to kind of recognize that was going on."
11092.0,Patient,"Is recognizable so. Before before I would just. jump into the conversation, and I think what it was doing is distracting or are ruining the person talking to you about trying to expand their weird things. So I just. were to just kind of sit back and listen to that first."
383.0,Provider,"mm hmm. Well that's such a key component to a conversation is the listening part of it. And it's also an important component to understanding the person, you know, on deeper levels to over time, you know, the more you listen to them, the more you kind of start to understand other aspects of. who they are."
11092.0,Patient,there.
383.0,Provider,"yeah. Do you find. Do you feel like you were just distracted by what was going on internally or your own sort of self evaluations. Making it hard to listen, sometimes."
11092.0,Patient,"Yes, this is a internally just. Dealing with my thoughts internally and. Just changing the way I think that's a lot to say there's not a lot just again it's all came down to. Speaking in the present and. helped me to really understand it to listen, as well."
383.0,Provider,Do you have a place to take those you know internal concerns because sometimes those do need to be expressed and talked over.
11092.0,Patient,it's not really just. First them so.
383.0,Provider,"And I you know, this is a place if you choose to if you want to take one of those things out and say you know, this is something that's been i've been going back and forth about or i've been feeling. confused, or whatever you know that we can discuss. Some of the internal because there are some times internal conflicts regarding decisions regarding past choices, or just. disappointments that you know you can pull out and discuss or review and."
11092.0,Patient,yeah right now. Everyone else's because at this point if you don't. You don't.
383.0,Provider,"mm hmm so right now, you kind of just want to leave those concerns to the side. As right okay. how's just your sleep wake schedule your routine, how are you doing with maintaining a routine and getting to sleep at night, and then you know."
11092.0,Patient,"yeah their routine is still working progress I go to sleep that pretty reasonable hour. But. If I don't if I stay up late, then. I usually tend to wake back up. In the middle of my sleep. So. Those days are yeah I would have really. morning, where I feel groggy. sleep overall still a work in progress. it's difficult to change the routine."
383.0,Provider,"yeah it is yeah. Do you do you shoot for a particular time at night to go to bed or how. Do you have brackets around your work in terms of Okay, this is the time, where I do my work and then, and then I do my family life, you know after the workday is over, and I don't go back to my work desk or how is that, how is that for you."
11092.0,Patient,"yeah that's probably one of the biggest challenges facing is really just kind of balancing the work that I have with my family, the work that I have this. Sometimes tedious."
383.0,Provider,uh huh.
11092.0,Patient,"I would carry out like a days. For a good turnout, the word normal hours, the towards the acronym and that. was slow down, I think there's no although for will see everyone you guys a good nine to five eight to five job. I would, I would tend to pick it up again later in the night. Okay leads me to sleeping late. Which kind of that kind of that snowball effect that. combination of different things coming at me. would lead me to that. So it's definitely something to work, creating a. routine the routine it's difficult to sometimes the word. Demands demands it doesn't have that amount of time, so."
383.0,Provider,"Do you find your interest in mentioned that your interest sort of slows down in the afternoon, due to the tedious nature of your work. You know your productivity and your attention is just. It just sort of wears down in the afternoon hours. And so you get a second wind and then you pick it back up in the evening is that kind of how. It has and."
11092.0,Patient,Very. Good because when. it's kind of a whole routine for the kids for sure during that that evening. routine thing getting them prepared for dinner and then prepare for bed and. So that probably is very. routine that every day is the same. routine and nature so. That can be stressful too. yeah.
383.0,Provider,"I would you like it to be, how would you."
11092.0,Patient,I don't know how I could change that to be since that's sort of how the routine goes for. For vintage prepared.
383.0,Provider,"I guess, I was speaking more in terms of your your work. How would you like to and. What would be your ideal kind of structure for it, for your work day."
11092.0,Patient,"I do yeah I work sort of like that eight to five and then really close up. Okay, that there's a distinct. cut in time, where I would I would devote to film. Okay um. I worked home from home or remotely before. Kobe. So. I tended to start having this routine where it's early morning morning. And then, and then kind of like slows down and then in the afternoon. If I had to pick it up at anything. So it's. Like I said, sometimes the work demands it, but. What my goal is to have it kind of that not be the norm. Right now, it is sort of the long or it is."
383.0,Provider,"OK, it is the norm, and that is due to. A waning of your of your own attention span in the afternoon or your own kind of will to do it."
11092.0,Patient,to usher right.
383.0,Provider,Do you start early do you start like at eight or Does that also kind of is that also tough because you're the difficulty of sleep and then. Do you get started a little bit later than you would like.
11092.0,Patient,"Though I started. Most mornings every rules, I would say, probably every morning at eight i'm there at the laptop a. This is a fresh day it's fresh day on freshly recharged and there's this you know check the email see there's anything that's high priority that I need to get done. So. don't have that difficulty in the mornings."
383.0,Provider,"And then do you take a lunch break at. A particular time, I do. have said it's more of like."
11092.0,Patient,"that's another thing that really part of that open phone, it is to work on as well, proper lunch they really set aside the time for lunch because. If of crunching data and. It takes me through lunch then i'll probably be ending up staying at the laptop well taking a break for lunch, so my lunches yet anymore, but past the past name. Sometimes some days I don't. eat lunch this isn't necessarily a good thing and. that's that part just kind of. overlap overlaps into the afternoon, where I only realized that well okay i've been working for this long it's already two o'clock. And so. The last one I thought about was to. get off the laptop for lunch at noon, but yeah those when you overlap into those times. I skipped that that that hunger so. go straight to the mid afternoon."
383.0,Provider,"Well, I mean some people like to kind of capitalize on their sort of morning. run of costumes and and productivity, and I know I do that, I mean I don't take my lunch till two in the afternoon pretty much I have that scheduled and in the early part of the week and then in the later part of the week my schedule goes I take it at like one but. I lived in Spain, everybody has lunch at two or three in the afternoon it's. Not a beer yeah and I might have some snacks along the way, because I know that i'm fresher and i'm more alert in the morning and i'm going to get. And I want to get more done then, so I mean if you can plan your your like your schedule to fit you, since you know you can do that. You can say okay at 130 i'm going to take my lunch break and but, but one thing I don't advise you know chin saying one cell phone or you know, ignoring is your need for a break, you know. To take an hour break, just like you would in an office you know you're going to take an hour lunch break you you close, but if you give do you think that that might work for you to like you know give yourself that long. stretch of time to be productive, but then at 130 you know that's when you tie you start tying up the ends, you know at one o'clock already you know, so that you can complete a project so that you can end."
11092.0,Patient,"Yes, no, I see your point so. yeah, even though I tend to overlap to two o'clock. Two o'clock three o'clock lunches it's okay just. plan that for the day rather than always shooting for name."
383.0,Provider,yeah.
11092.0,Patient,But yeah I said I agree with your point.
383.0,Provider,"Maybe you could just. I mean, if you want to work till two and then take a break from but then have a shorter day in you know, in the later part of the day. eight to two is pretty long. yeah no I don't start till nine. But. I mean my point being is to if this is sort of a pattern that is sort of natural for you, we can try to work with it, but still give yourself. The break for lunch and then, and then you have been to you know if you have an hour to be away, then you can come back and have a couple of hours and then close. Should we set that as kind of a little mini goal for you and. We are live that. yeah Okay, so our appointments only 30 minutes today our next appointment I think it's 45 so i'll have a little bit more time on the 26. But I just. wanted to just. Is there anything else that you feel like you wanted to address."
11092.0,Patient,"Right yeah. Or, I mean just really was just discussed with the routine daily routine is really we're going to focus on."
383.0,Provider,"Okay, good, and I think also you know choosing asleep time and really adhering to that you know, even if it's if you're go to bed late and it's hard to switch from going to bed it. it's hard to make big changes, but if you can. shave it down a bit so that you're going you decide you're going to try to shoot for like 11 or 1030 you know or whatever works for you, but you're going to really try to adhere to that bedtime would be would be good to what do you think about that."
11092.0,Patient,Okay yeah. that's.
383.0,Provider,What what time is is reasonable to do you think. what's.
11092.0,Patient,"The Sumerian for what, for the."
383.0,Provider,To go to bed.
11092.0,Patient,"Oh, it was looked at 10 o'clock but."
383.0,Provider,Shooting for 10 with a little wiggle room there.
11092.0,Patient,you're right okay.
383.0,Provider,And then having what time would you like to have your lunch break just so that we've got we've got a.
11092.0,Patient,"See you want to thought I know info comes around, and I see 12 I feel like I could route something up in the next five to 10 Minutes it ends up i'm wrapping it up around 1245 or more towards one o'clock to leave that one o'clock hour for lunch, is where we could go by. To set it up."
383.0,Provider,"Okay, good and then do you want to take a half hour lunch or an hour lunch."
11092.0,Patient,pepper.
383.0,Provider,Okay.
11092.0,Patient,it's already really just to get some food.
