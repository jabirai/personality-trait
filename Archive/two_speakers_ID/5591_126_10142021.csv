He had some brain issues. But he was. It was healthy it wasn't diagnosed with anything.
126.0,Provider,"God because usually they say. You know, there has to be other complications if you're young and you know pretty healthy that there's some other complications, you know if somebody dies from coven like like they have a bad hard, or they have you know fibromyalgia or they have diabetes."

5591.0,Patient,It is sad because I I love it. there's a big shock.
126.0,Provider,mm hmm. you've gone through some some hell they're having you.
5591.0,Patient,yeah for the past few years yeah.
126.0,Provider,"What do you do for yourself for self care, how do you take care of yourself."
5591.0,Patient,I don't do much. I don't do much. I don't know i'm just. Sometimes I can't even clean my house I don't know what's wrong with me.
126.0,Provider,"mm hmm well, I mean we all have our ups and downs, you know comes and goes."
5591.0,Patient,"I want to do things with others, so I can't make myself sometimes."
126.0,Provider,mm hmm. And is that do you feel like that's due to depression or.
5591.0,Patient,"So. i'm just i'm really optimistic person, so I I make the best out of whatever situation, I mean but. I think it takes a toll, you know."
126.0,Provider,yeah definitely.
5591.0,Patient,i've always had an anxiety disorder so i've kind of. learned or I guess bottle it up or something that it's just. Like.
126.0,Provider,Have you ever tried to you know get on some medication to help or you're trying to handle it.
5591.0,Patient,Without one.
126.0,Provider,When. you're already on mental health mets. yeah they don't seem to help or year you get.
5591.0,Patient,"First, without them i've been taking on for so long, I think, like probably the weekend, but i'm scared to do any tweaking with the i've had some bad experiences being allergic and. different things, so I don't like change. The doctor that I had for like 12 years I lost her when I lost my insurance so i'll. just talk about that. Welcome, that I got changed everything and I don't have it like is it so. i'm trying to find another doctor."
126.0,Provider,mm hmm. And you go to any type of outside counseling other than here right harthill.
5591.0,Patient,"Sometimes I do i'm not currently, but I have and i've always wanted to go to therapy so i'm going to try to. Probably go with one place she's going cuz I need to find another place anyway."
126.0,Provider,mm hmm yeah I think that would be a big benefit to you.
5591.0,Patient,yeah I think I need a best appealing to do.
126.0,Provider,mm hmm definitely.
5591.0,Patient,i'm think i'm just sitting out of New York.
126.0,Provider,"And you have no so I asked you about self care and you basically kind of just shrug that off is that because you feel like. You don't have time for self care you don't deserve self care you're too lazy to do self care, what do you think that's about."
5591.0,Patient,"I don't think i'm lazy i'm just. My I have OCD and I just. I get bored easy and I just. You know just a little battle in their own time. But I mean I. Think bubble baths and stuff like that, I mean, I still care."
126.0,Provider,You do what.
5591.0,Patient,I clicked bubble baths and do my nails and stuff.
126.0,Provider,"Okay that's definitely self care yeah, no, no, no, we count that as self care yeah for sure I mean. Part of the you know depression, I think, is you know. You kind of got to do little things to lift yourself out, you know so when you do self care, like a bubble bath or facial or go get a massage or or do something just for you. I think what that does is you know not only make you feel better about yourself but also make you feel like yeah I deserve this and I need this, and I should be doing this for myself. You know, because you're going through not only recovery, but you know other personal shit in your life and. No personal care is kind of like i'm stopping i'm taking a break and i'm focusing on me. And you need that you need that a lot need that special attention to yourself."
5591.0,Patient,"I think I carry a lot of guilt over. There everything went down with my ex husband and. I don't know until my kids get back home, I guess, I. And luck, I got out of it and they're still in it, or something."
126.0,Provider,"yeah. and So you know that's you if you are if. that's the case you're doing all you can do, then you've got to let up on that guilt on yourself because. Are you just sitting on your thumbs crossing your fingers hoping they'll know you're working at you're doing something you're going to port you're doing the footwork. got to give yourself credit for that you're doing what you can you can't control the universe you can't control the courts, you can't control your X, so all you can do is work within certain constraints constraints constraints yeah. And, and I think you're doing that, as best as you can. You know, so the things that are out of your control are just that, out of your control and you can't take on the guilt for something that you can't control."
5591.0,Patient,With my babies and I just have a hard time with it.
126.0,Provider,"yeah yeah I see that understand it would be like, for example, if if my daughter was going off to Europe okay and she's in France and her plane. I don't know it's is there's something wrong something's going on and she's calling me to let me know. Okay, I can't do anything to help her."
5591.0,Patient,know.
126.0,Provider,"You know, and so we have to be able to discern Is this something I can control Is this something I can change and, if I can, how do I change it, and if I can't how do I accept it. The bad and the good. And it's a hard thing you got to work on it it's definitely a hard, because when you're fighting those things that you can't change it's exhausting it's just exhausting."
5591.0,Patient,You.
126.0,Provider,Know fully. Emotionally available for your kids. Because you're. you're so busy in this this psychological fine.
5591.0,Patient,that's what it is for sure.
126.0,Provider,"mm hmm. yeah I know when I was going through divorce and. My ex basically wanted nothing to do with me or my kid for years and then all of a sudden decided Oh, I want to be back in your life again uh you know I want, I want to see my daughter, she was 12 years old. She didn't even know he was. it's like. You don't get to do any of that you, you took me to court Lou and had mediation. Court said oh yeah he gets to visit her three hours once a month. So the place, he would visitor at was like an hour and a half, away from where I lived, but I would drive her there and I would sit out in the parking lot it was like a roller. What was it, it was. A Bowling place and it's like two different things. Like a penny arcade or something and and he'd spend like three hours with she she really didn't even know him really didn't know his name really didn't know anything about him. And I would just be so afraid that he was going to take off with her that I sat in the parking lot the whole three hours, just like watching the door. And me. You know, and I kept seeing oh my God is this going to be the future is this what's going to happen, he got tired of it, because she wasn't calling them oh Daddy Daddy Daddy well, I was, I was already remarried and she's already calling somebody else Daddy. So she called him by his name and he didn't like that. So after I don't even think it was two years because, about a year and a half, he finally said no yeah i'm done you're done. You know, and, to this day, my daughter thinks I destroyed their relationship."
5591.0,Patient,"Oh, really."
126.0,Provider,"He got yeah there's absolutely nothing I can do about that it's like you don't know you don't know fucking jerk I mean just. And you know I did my bit I even denied paternity, I even said no he's not the father just. Around just to put it off, as long as possible, because I I knew he was going to lose interest. And so, then it was like another six months to do paternity test and, of course, he was her father, which I knew, but I just thought okay this guy is he's not. A loving kind person at all, he is not going to keep coming to visit her. And I just know. more about it, and then, and then, when he suddenly disappeared out of her life. You know, he actually wrote me a letter which I would ever give to my daughter that said i'm starting a family of my own I don't have time for this bullshit."
5591.0,Patient,hmm.
126.0,Provider,"And you know I of course I would never show that letter to my daughter, and say this is what your father, this is what kind of Father you you biological father, I mean you're adopted father was fantastic that to this day she. she's still blames me for the breakup of the relationship with her biological father who should never liked and didn't know and didn't want to go on these visits."
5591.0,Patient,After a while for. What you provide or not.
126.0,Provider,"No, no supervision. No. It was uh yeah I mean, and I was shocked because first of all I had found out in the meantime that he had a suspended driver's license and originally they said he would come and pick her up. And I said absolutely not she's already in the car with him for an hour now. he's on a suspended license I even asked the judge what do you think would happen if the COPs pulled him over and card him off to jail, what is she what's my daughter going to do. Judge was like Oh, I think she'd know what to do, she's fucking 12. What are you talking, I will drive her, and I will wait in the parking lot. And, and what. I mean, and I sat in the parking lot, just like on edge, the whole time thinking he's going to sneak out the back, I just kept thinking it was going to you know kidnapper."
5591.0,Patient,But it's more always always worried about stuff like that was was not. That that's what I thought. We got.
126.0,Provider,"mm hmm. yeah. Oh yes, it is yes, it is yeah. And and really and I had nothing to do with the end of the demise of their relationship I just kind of knew this is not going to last."
5591.0,Patient,"Well, or that it was."
126.0,Provider,What.
5591.0,Patient,It was him.
126.0,Provider,No. No. I did not feel like I could tell her that. He chose to stop seeing her how How would that news be taken by a child.
5591.0,Patient,"well. I want my kids have been pretty resilient they're starting to now take up for me and. not be afraid to do that, but I thought you know I don't talk about him if they are you're around it, they know how negative he is and they. See, so I don't lock him about that stuff because we're living in it anyway. I mean if I could, if I could at all, you know cyber that relationship out, I guess, I would travel they see they see everything that he does so. My son told them. They were in the vehicle together and apparently his dad said, well, maybe when you click it for your mom and. And my son said yeah and he said no wait a minute that he said. Oh, really, yes I get for you, because mom doesn't talk about."
126.0,Provider,Nice.
5591.0,Patient,"I thought I was so proud of him to i'm so proud and his sister was too, I mean I was just so proud he just tired he's tired of it."
126.0,Provider,mm hmm.
5591.0,Patient,me and I won't listen to him and.
126.0,Provider,yeah.
5591.0,Patient,"We started it. was hard. to break apart, when it comes to stay with me, but I just don't want us to do. i'm going to come back boring though i'm gonna let him know that."
126.0,Provider,mm hmm. And how do you still get to see him like.
5591.0,Patient,Oh yeah.
126.0,Provider,we're basis okay.
5591.0,Patient,We got joint custody. Okay he's got primary custodial parent but. He went to court and. Why pretty much.
126.0,Provider,Right basically threw you under the bus.
5591.0,Patient,"Yes, and I mean we went to court for four times and he lost the first, second and third time and then he had it taken out of that judges court because he didn't like the answer he was getting is pretty much what it was and Thompson lies and. got primary custodial that's all i'm worried about what's possible anyway, but still split time."
126.0,Provider,mm hmm.
5591.0,Patient,Like a mediation thing he just don't follow his. Part of.
126.0,Provider,Her mm hmm. yeah.
5591.0,Patient,"I was worried about the brainwashing and stuff but i'll probably hear of it i'm not like that, because, like they see I don't have to say anything because they see."
126.0,Provider,"Exactly that's The thing that these men don't understand that their own. fucked up defective character speaks for itself, nobody has to say anything negative against them because they are really doing that for themselves."
5591.0,Patient,"You know, and they just don't get it, they don't understand."
126.0,Provider,"yeah no I never talked bad about him, and you know of course he he blamed me for my daughter not calling him Daddy Daddy Daddy he and it's like the girl doesn't know you."
5591.0,Patient,Tell anybody that he earned that if the call that they earned it.
126.0,Provider,"yeah so one day he called leftists a horrible message that his own daughter didn't call him to say happy father's day i'm. And, and then the whole message was like cheese fucking calling some other man or her dad, and I mean it just went on and on and on, I recorded the whole thing it was just. You know fucking bitch blah blah blah and I tried to play that for the mediator and she was like oh no you can't we can't listen to phone messages unless the person knows they're being recorded everybody knows her be recorded when they leave a phone message. So I mean I would try to kind of come up with evidence against him that real true evidence, they wouldn't let. They they basically gave him everything he wanted, even though he had a record, even though he had a suspended license. Even though he's a gambler he didn't even have a regular job um you know I brought up the fact the man has never paid a dime of child support ever and the judge told me well you're making more money than him so maybe you should pay him."
5591.0,Patient,Oh.
126.0,Provider,i'm not getting.
5591.0,Patient,"It you know that my MIC. Like 100 grand a year and i'm like like 12. And that's i'm sure, and they. They don't work like that around here, you know. They don't work with that around here because he was able to get up I said what for two hours going to divorce hearing and listening to him about me for two hours and. every bit of it, listen to."
126.0,Provider,It.
5591.0,Patient,is like he's friends with them down there I don't know.
126.0,Provider,"I know you start to think what did he pay them off, I mean, why are they listening to him."
5591.0,Patient,Because he's a trooper and he worked on there.
126.0,Provider,"Right, so they respect him because of his job."
5591.0,Patient,yeah. So on ones that know. The ones that knowing don't and they've got. they've got a little taste of being out there because he's these through a couple tantrums on them out there too.
126.0,Provider,mm hmm.
5591.0,Patient,"But where he's a State trooper they he said respect, but he never earned. right when you wear the uniform. it's it's sickening."
126.0,Provider,"Is it is there's there's really no. Justice at all, I mean."
5591.0,Patient,"hey I found out my daughter told me that he that two years ago she said it happened two years ago and then he's been bringing it up wanting her to emancipate herself and let him adopt her. i'm like you can't do that without the mother, can you."
126.0,Provider,"Work Oh, it is OK."
5591.0,Patient,Unless what.
126.0,Provider,Unless the mother says it's okay.
5591.0,Patient,"Well, sometimes he his wisdom around, I guess, and I don't think he would have asked you to do it if he couldn't do it. I think he's got. me down there at the courthouse that was going to do something dirty, but I find. I mean 15 year old should not be able to feel without the mother. The other course know you mom and she said no i'm so proud of. You telling. them. it's um it's it's something."
126.0,Provider,"Here, because he has no repercussions for his actions he's just getting away with it over and over again."
5591.0,Patient,He just you know flapping in the wind and i'm the one that has to do this.
126.0,Provider,mm hmm.
5591.0,Patient,"i'm gonna eat all the shit. And i'm i've been over for a while now, I don't even argue with me more I just. You know i've stood up to him and i'm proud of myself for that. Good continue to use the kids to get at me as long as he can. Yes, cool and he knows that I love them and i'm not going to stop loving them and that's the only reason why he can't he can't get to me himself is because I don't react anymore. i'm always. Like i'm always gonna react."
126.0,Provider,"Well, good. And you know what it says something about you that your kids are kind of taking this reaction, you know not not believing him not doing what he says and kind of knowing that okay you're not talking bad about him he's talking bad about you who's the bad guy here."
5591.0,Patient,"Yes, and i'm so so blessed and. i'm so."
126.0,Provider,"done something right lady. You did something right with your kids that's something to pat yourself on the back with and something to be proud of, I mean they may not be carrying out the way you thought they would or should or what but you did a good job, raising those kids."
5591.0,Patient,I thought I did i'm i'm just so thankful.
126.0,Provider,mm hmm. it's fucked up situation and it always makes me wonder how did I love this person. That I now cannot stand.
5591.0,Patient,"Today, what I wanted to be wanted him to be until he got what happened there. I pretended."
126.0,Provider,"mm hmm. yeah I don't know about you, but. i'm done with men. In."
5591.0,Patient,"black, for one reason."
126.0,Provider,"One reason you know I tried to even I was like. i'm going to be gay, I want to be gay I don't want any do with men anymore, I tried to be gay for two years, I tried to convert myself it didn't it didn't work, you know kept dreaming about men it's like no I don't find any men. And, in turn, myself, gay, no matter how hard, I tried you."
5591.0,Patient,know me.
126.0,Provider,"But yeah it's it's tough out there when things don't work out and we've got to just keep fighting and fighting and you know kudos to you that you're. you're doing your part and you're not going down to his level, you can say 1000 bad things about him to your kids if you wanted to but you're choosing not to and that's integrity."
5591.0,Patient,"Well, it hurts. And I want to hurdle."
126.0,Provider,"Of course, but he's you know you can do the same thing he's doing use them against him, but because you actually do love those those kids you can't you can't Fuck with their heads or their hearts like that."
5591.0,Patient,"i'm just so grateful to. He got the reason even treat me the way does, I mean you think that he'd be grateful that they had of your mother. You know. anyway."
126.0,Provider,"yeah it's exhausting having to deal with that. But you'll get beyond it, this too shall change it's not going to be forever."
5591.0,Patient,you're getting a little while I mean that's.
