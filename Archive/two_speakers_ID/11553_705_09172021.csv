705.0,Provider,hi Emily. hi Emily. I see you're connecting to audio.
11553.0,Patient,cameras fuzzy. it's weird.
705.0,Provider,about yesterday and that whole like pass code thing that was happening so.
11553.0,Patient,it's okay got it sorted.
705.0,Provider,Did you have to do it today.
11553.0,Patient,"They said that. They said that, and you said it was probably smart to reschedule, just in case, so I just went ahead and did that."
705.0,Provider,"yeah well, thank you, I appreciate. yeah it was so odd that with."
11553.0,Patient,That is weird. i'm glad you had something today. That worked out really well.
705.0,Provider,yeah you know with zoom it's great and it's one of those things that again i'm a work in progress and so.
11553.0,Patient,yeah.
705.0,Provider,"it's happening, I can see people are trying to get it it's not happening i'm like."
11553.0,Patient,"yeah it's just. Know like. there's it's one more factor. it's like if it's in person, then it's like you've got the car right there and that's, the only thing that could really go wrong, probably, hopefully, but now there's a whole nother thing in the system so."
705.0,Provider,"It is and it's always for me, a good reminder about heroin am with all the techniques and things like that in my tool belt and it's just like."
11553.0,Patient,yeah. Use them yeah.
705.0,Provider,identify use them. More importantly. How are you.
11553.0,Patient,"i'm i'm having a rough week honestly I. was pretty okay on Tuesday, when I saw you in group but. That day. I think later in the day. My grandpa went in for an angioplasty to like get his heart checked out because he's been having really serious heart issues and. They ended up admitting him to the hospital and doing open heart surgery like immediately. And it went well he's okay so that's really good. But now my dad thinks he's going to move in with them, in addition to my mom being gone so. Which kind of leads me is like head of the House which. I absolutely understand. But it's still just like sad."
705.0,Provider,"Sad in a huge change, I mean."
11553.0,Patient,"yeah and I think my mom will be coming home, which I didn't know at the time, I think she's coming home next Monday, so that helps, and that means there's probably only going to be a couple of days when I don't have either of them because. I don't think my grandpa will be out of the hospital for another week so that helps for sure. Just really weird really big change and it's also really weird because that side of the family wasn't really talking to us and. All of a sudden, like now that they need something they're like we should put every all the weirdness that we have behind us and let's just work through this and my dad's like yeah that's. How I felt for a long time, and so he's really nervous about going out there and what it'll be like emotionally and. yeah it's just a lot to process."
705.0,Provider,"yeah you said, it is a lot of process and that whole feeling of being stressed and is your grandfather going to be okay, and now you know he's Okay, I mean it's just like that fear and."
11553.0,Patient,"And it's weird because it's kind of seemed like he was in critical health for a couple of years, at this point, maybe even longer, because it was like pre coven. I remember thinking like I don't know if he'll make it through the year and then he got coated and somehow survived it like he just keeps pushing through stuff and. So I kind of feel like i've had to cope with the thought of losing him so many times at this point that it's just exhausting every time another emergency happens it's like man like again like yeah."
705.0,Provider,"it's a reminder to you know, sometimes like you were saying with your father is where people aren't talking and then you realize that you might not have that tomorrow and that. yeah and then it's like kind of live for today and tell people how you feel and when."
11553.0,Patient,"And that's the hard thing is like we've kind of been aware of that and it feels like that side of the family is sort of in denial and so. we're worried that we won't get to see them again before they die, and they haven't totally accepted that that's how we feel and they'll still cut us off and. not talk to us, and when they do talk to us be really passive aggressive and, like my grandma has started saying at the end of every phone call like. Okay well i'm gonna i'm gonna cut you off i'm gonna let you go because I don't want you to never call again it's like it, that makes me not want to call again sharing that."
705.0,Provider,yeah and is it possible to that she's trying to be funny but then it's not funny.
11553.0,Patient,Because yeah there definitely.
705.0,Provider,is like okay.
11553.0,Patient,All right. yeah yeah.
705.0,Provider,So what's the plan for the weekend. For you.
11553.0,Patient,"I don't know I work, the next three days and. that's another thing that's really stressing me out as i'm just kind of realizing that i'm at wit's end with being an artist at trader joe's. And I think I need to talk to them about it, but because it's the holidays. The job is way bigger and there's nobody who can take my position if I stepped down. And I also kind of committed to my boss, the guy was planning on leaving the store and transferring somewhere else for a while until I realized, there was no mass mandate and then. Once I told him I was staying he, like had me commit to staying through the holidays, assuming that I would be an artist. But he kind of caught me at like a time where I was running into like go clock in so I was just like yeah sure i'll do it, but I just feel super super overwhelmed by the thought of doing this for another three months and even for another weekend so Something has to change. But because I just I don't get exercise at work anymore like i'm used to and I don't get to talk to people because i'm just alone in the back, and I really love talking to customers and I don't. get to socialize with coworkers except the people who just hang out in the break room all day, which is generally not the kind of people that I like hanging out with i'm finding and. I don't know i'm just feeling very stuck at work so it's nice only working weekends, but then. The whole weekend is just like me feeling super stressed and stuck."
705.0,Provider,"How it's like one hand work may be a good distraction because of what's going on in your family life. yeah when itself there's some some stressors there, but the way that you said, like it was to me. The way that you said it and explained it was very like hey I get it, you know and for your is that your manager that you talk to last time, like Is this a person that would receive this information and and be like okay hearing you out."
11553.0,Patient,"Theoretically, yes it's hard because Saturdays he doesn't work and then Sunday Monday our busiest days so it's really hard to catch him when i'm there. So I talked to the like shift lead, basically, who is in charge of the earth team last time. And she's now out on medical leave, so I would have to talk specifically to the captain so that's another thing is I don't have like a direct line person to go to anymore so i'm missing that support at work too. So."
705.0,Provider,"Is there a way to. I get that you're trying to see like the proper chain of command who do you talk to. yeah way, though, to start to pull back instead of the holidays, like the holidays aren't there yet, is it going to be stressful probably so my. holiday yeah but just taken each day like today, do you have to go to work."
11553.0,Patient,No okay.
705.0,Provider,"it's just like taking it to today today can you write down some of these things, and as a form of letting it go enjoy what you can today and then tomorrow, you have to work."
11553.0,Patient,yeah.
705.0,Provider,"And then picking back up that work back and being like okay now now, this might work bag. you're at work, if you start to think about the holidays, is to be able to be like right now i'm at work, this is what i'm doing."
11553.0,Patient,"yeah it's just a matter of like the amount that they put on my plate all at once, and like the lack of understanding of how stressful It is like. Because anyone can come up to me, at my desk and be like hey can you make a sign for this and I don't think people know how many people at a time do that. Then people do that, and then the managers will come up to me and be like hey i'm building a display so I need 10 signs and a chalkboard sign and it just like piles up like crazy and I remember, like last weekend I got there at 6am on Saturday and I cried three times before 10. Just because I was so stressed."
705.0,Provider,"yeah and I think what you said was important that they don't even realize. No one person come in and doing it would be different, but you're. In multiple times, and this is reoccurring."
11553.0,Patient,"yeah and it's hard because they don't if I get there at six I started coming in at six instead of seven because I didn't have enough time. Before the store opened to walk around and make sure everything had signs and as soon as I started coming in earlier, even though I said that I wanted to come in earlier to get more art done they wouldn't give me art time they would put me on something else and it's like. On the one hand that's what I want to be doing, I want to be. Not doing as much art, but when they do it like at specifically the time when I need time on art it's like it's just so stressful like there's just. They don't know how much it stresses you out to be in that position and I get texts when i'm at home from them like asking about stuff i've gotten done at work extra days I can come in um. It just is so not why I wanted to get this job."
705.0,Provider,"So, you know that this isn't permanent."
11553.0,Patient,yeah.
705.0,Provider,"know that this is just temporary like you're just making it through to be able to. pay the bills to make this work for this month. Okay. But you have all these things that are valid reasons of what's going on and that you wish, you know to transfer eventually."
11553.0,Patient,"yeah or even just not do I mean yet, preferably transfer just because it's it's like a 22 mile commute but yeah."
705.0,Provider,"When you were at work, too, and that you released with crying was it any better or, then you could like regroup get back out there, because you install that energy."
11553.0,Patient,"i'm. i'm trying to remember what it was like it was a little bit better after but because somebody else showed up help me, not because I like had released it really."
705.0,Provider,"Okay, but you got the help that you."
11553.0,Patient,yeah.
705.0,Provider,How did you get the support.
11553.0,Patient,"They put somebody else on are they I didn't realize that they had someone else there to help me that day, so they were just kind of like piling on thing after thing, and I was like I can't do this and then they were like also we have someone to help you so it like got better."
705.0,Provider,"But that's understandable, I mean, my goodness, if you're gonna put them on my plate, you can only hold, so much so, yes, I know."
11553.0,Patient,yeah.
705.0,Provider,Any opportunities to give them feedback that that that work that made it manageable with the other person.
11553.0,Patient,"yeah yeah I think I need to that's, the main thing I think I need to talk to them about is saying like we need more help. And not just because they keep giving us people who can like cut out papers but that's not what we need help with like we just we need more people who can do everything that we can do right."
705.0,Provider,"And you've had that experience now you know. Yes, without and you can report what it was like with."
11553.0,Patient,And yeah yeah here.
705.0,Provider,here's here's the proof basically beautiful. yeah here's what i'm wanting here's my experience.
11553.0,Patient,yeah.
705.0,Provider,"Oh, you know it's like just want to be like Emily for you go and take a couple of deep breaths it's almost like. Your Armor you're like what are they going to come with me today."
11553.0,Patient,yeah I just find myself like. I feel like i'm gonna cry every time that I like. i'm sitting in the parking lot about to go in i'm just like how do I shut off my emotions and how do I just like. How do I make myself not feel anything so that I can make it through the day I just like I come up blank.
705.0,Provider,"yeah and I would maybe take an alternative approach to that that that's one way to handle it disconnect shut off. And then explore the alternatives, is it accepting that you have valid reasons for the stress to accept that this is really going on this is how you feel. and being able to when you feel comfortable to have those talks and finding that person that maybe he isn't in the proper chain of command it's someone to hear you well."
11553.0,Patient,yeah. yeah i'm. question is who.
705.0,Provider,"or even a third approach. Probably there's a lot of them, but what What else do you. feel like."
11553.0,Patient,"Is it. I don't know. I feel like what would be ideal. At this point would just be to say like. Because I feel too intimidated by talking to my boss and saying like I can't do this anymore. Even though that's how I really feel. I feel like what would make the most sense would be to say, like, I would like to. Do art, maybe half of the time, like half of my shifts and. We need more people. Because if i'm not doing it all the time, then the pressure is off of me because i'm not one of the main people. yeah. The frustrating thing, and I feel kind of guilty about this, but people come up to me all the time and say that they feel like i'm the best artists in the store. which I feel guilty about because the other woman has been doing it for like you know 10 years and it's her passion and she really like she's really, really good and people don't really like her. So I always feel really guilty when they say that to me, but it also means that they want me specifically to do signs all the time, so it's like. yeah it's it's a complicated dynamic."
705.0,Provider,you're appreciating the artwork.
11553.0,Patient,Which is really like a good feeling on the surface for sure.
705.0,Provider,"mm hmm. And that's where it's letting it out where it's like yes, I get this appreciation I love that. i'm also thankful that this person has been doing this other person, too, and that not taken away from her. yeah and then trying to make this work where i'm not feeling overwhelmed when i'm here and to me having what you just shared where it would be some. Of you with the artwork somewhere you're getting you know your needs met where you're able to engage with you know others the customers and things like that."
11553.0,Patient,yeah. yeah. yeah.
705.0,Provider,"What do you have in your arsenal of like before you even get there, like and preparedness."
11553.0,Patient,um. What do you mean like before talking to them about it.
705.0,Provider,"yeah i've had where you know, some people bring them music if there's a certain type of music to pump them up or a mantra to come off or they go and take a run before they go to or her."
11553.0,Patient,"I just have trouble with like procrastinating so i'll usually like set a specific time where like I will talk to this person at this time we're all countdown or. Is Those are the main two. So just kind of like I have to set a time to do it, or I won't do it."
705.0,Provider,"Okay, so set a set of time and then and then do it, and then preparing yourself mentally or physically. What do you think you could do that morning."
11553.0,Patient,I don't know. yeah I really don't know.
705.0,Provider,Anything that you do like this past week or two weeks that you've noticed lifts your mood a little bit.
11553.0,Patient,"wearing wearing something that I feel like myself, and like wearing clothes that make me feel good makes me feel more confident what i'm saying."
705.0,Provider,mm hmm.
11553.0,Patient,more justified in what i'm saying even sometimes.
705.0,Provider,"Okay, so so dress and I know that probably has its limits, because there's. yeah uniform but can't can it be you know part of that were. yeah something that you're confident in you're already feeling good going in."
11553.0,Patient,"yeah that's a good idea. um. I have a song that I listened to and i'm really, really down, just like on repeat good play that on the way to work."
705.0,Provider,And when you're down it lifts you up.
11553.0,Patient,yeah. It just feels cathartic. Okay yeah.
705.0,Provider,"Arctic, which is also soothing and cotton."
11553.0,Patient,Come yeah it's like it's like home.
705.0,Provider,"Okay, good good. Yes, I was a because I wanted to make sure if it's something that makes you even feel more at a loss that maybe that's."
11553.0,Patient,"Good, no, no."
705.0,Provider,"yeah so it's like it is kind of preparing for that battle it's like okay i'm going in. yeah yes to the music i'm going to you know already have the time, this is not what i'm going to set the stage for."
11553.0,Patient,"yeah that would be helpful. I want to say, like call a friend, but it's like 530 in the morning when i'm driving to work so that wouldn't."
705.0,Provider,At that time you. know in a different time zone.
11553.0,Patient,"No. No, my friends on the east coast are like basically until noon so."
705.0,Provider,Okay you're like.
11553.0,Patient,"No, I guess, like. If I decide to talk to him after my lunch break I could call my mom and my lunch break baby."
705.0,Provider,"Oh so reach out gain some support. Today, doing a lot of self care."
11553.0,Patient,"yeah it's hard I won't be able to talk to him until Sunday so that leaves a whole other day to like stress about it, but I guess it's. Also, a day to prepare for it but. You don't want to I feel like I overthink it if I have time to. Think."
705.0,Provider,"How, then, like what technique works best for you, then, to get it out and stop it from like ruminating and coming back."
11553.0,Patient,"I think journaling because I. Have carpal tunnel, so I can't write very fast so. We which is ironic, as a sign artist, but I. Then it also just helps me organize my thoughts and make it more tangible."
705.0,Provider,"And if you're not able to write it, but you know getting it out as helpful as even dictating in your phone, which then leaves you a memo of it already. Just to get it out. yeah it may still come around but maybe not as often."
11553.0,Patient,"yeah that makes sense. yeah and I do have some stuff written out already because i've for weeks i've kind of felt like this was coming and like I needed to do something. And then, in the weekdays because I don't have work i'm just kind of like well, maybe it's not that bad and then the weekend hits again and i'm like No, this is really bad."
705.0,Provider,"So yeah and part of it, too, is feeding like you know, making yourself Mills that are really good and healthy sometimes too like I I saw is it coffee or tea or. Coffee coffee, are you sensitive to caffeine."
11553.0,Patient,"Sometimes, and sometimes not. Cry it it feels kind of random like sometimes I definitely feel it and sometimes it's like I didn't drink it."
705.0,Provider,"So, not knowing if how that's going away is that morning being mindful of how much intake you have if you're going to. Start yeah and monitor."
11553.0,Patient,that's a good idea.
705.0,Provider,"I know, sometimes with the caffeine, it comes out a rush and then you're like whoa wait."
11553.0,Patient,yeah it's definitely.
705.0,Provider,"Good stuff, though."
11553.0,Patient,"Tragically, yes."
705.0,Provider,I know i've noticed.
11553.0,Patient,Sometimes macia is better like I feel better when I have macia instead.
705.0,Provider,"yeah so maybe the caffeine, that you are somewhat sensitive and if that's making you feel where it's more of a balance."
11553.0,Patient,yeah that makes sense.
705.0,Provider,"it's so nice to like once you have like the stress is still going to be there, you know it's a life is stressful and it's just learning what we do have control over and. yeah are different and it's like well. Let me see if this helps."
11553.0,Patient,"yeah i've just been noticing that this week i've been super high strong and so. I don't know if it's specifically thinking about my job that's affecting me or if it's everything probably but. i've just been noticing that like little things really set me off, right now, and like. There was something the other day. Oh, I was, I was going through the pantry because I was stressed, cleaning and I was like just clearing stuff out and organizing and making it look Nice and. I don't remember how it came up but there's been an issue kind of my whole life, but also like recently, especially since I moved home i've been noticing it more. That my dad and my brother eat the food that I buy and it wouldn't be that big a deal, but they usually like a lot of it, or they finish it without telling me. And I have a really big issue with that, and so I said that I haven't really big issue with people finishing the food that I buy or eating a lot of it. And they both kind of said well it's not that big a deal or well, you have a lot of hit or. I didn't see reading it, and then they both like left the House and I was just left to like deal with the fact that I had said something made me upset and they both were like it shouldn't. And just. left it at that. And it kind of ruin the rest of my day and I felt really frustrated that it ruin the rest of my day because I didn't want it to, but I also felt like violated and just like really stuck. and out of control and I. don't know if this was a healthy thing to do, or not, but I got out a sharpie and I just wrote my name all over everything that I bought for myself, because I figured like that's the most I can do, I guess."
705.0,Provider,yeah and that sense of control and that's also with you had already verbalized your boundary. Whereas yeah the food i'm letting you know and it's upsetting I don't know what your excuses for eating it i've already set that boundary.
11553.0,Patient,"And they also both of them were like well you shouldn't pay for your own food mom and dad have offered knows like I pay for it, because it's mine and I want to stake that claim on it it's my food."
705.0,Provider,Please give me this this. title to.
11553.0,Patient,"I don't want to be living at home in the first place, I need this sense of self."
705.0,Provider,And not there. it's sounding like that they're. Not understanding how important it is to you.
11553.0,Patient,And that all yeah.
705.0,Provider,"they're making the excuse and then doing it anyhow, not knowing you know, like No, this is bigger than this."
11553.0,Patient,"And there was a cathartic moment where my brother was kind of sitting there for a while. And I was just like sort of sitting in silence and he was like did something happen or have you like. been in a mood all day. And I was like well I said I wasn't okay with you eating my food and then you and dad both said well it's okay with us, and he said when you put it that way that's messed up."
705.0,Provider,Thank you see.
11553.0,Patient,"He didn't say sorry, but it was still nice to hear him say that."
705.0,Provider,"Yes. and acknowledging and that that was good fruit for you to be able to even though, how they respond to it was inappropriate when you were bringing."
11553.0,Patient,yeah.
705.0,Provider,But he's learning. And that you didn't give up and you didn't allow the continuation of violating what you're saying. yeah it's like reestablishing that boundary it's like okay you're going to cross it i'm gonna bring it back.
11553.0,Patient,I mean i've learned at this point that if I let them continue to cross it then I start gaslighting myself about if that's normal if it's okay to have a boundary if it's if i'm being too much so.
705.0,Provider,"Right, but at the end of the day when you look at it Emily it's just like you purchase the food. You want to yeah food and it's like and then do you really need to explain yourself it's. cool yeah if you didn't want. To have to."
11553.0,Patient,yeah exactly.
705.0,Provider,So is it appropriate yeah.
11553.0,Patient,yeah absolutely. yeah.
705.0,Provider,i'm so glad that this isn't emptying you trying to be assertive when when you feel like your needs are being like I said violated and.
11553.0,Patient,Thanks.
705.0,Provider,"And then, mindful to where potentially it could ruin your day but bringing it back sorting through it and then even with your brother after your rather than said that's messed up. Were you able then to like release some of it and go forward with your day not thinking about it as much."
11553.0,Patient,"No, I wasn't honestly I really wanted that to be the moment where I like like oh of it, but I still I didn't and I just kind of like. felt stopped for the rest of the day."
705.0,Provider,"i'll cry. Okay. You know I think some of these things are takes practice, it takes, you know, also to for your family members to get to know you and where you are right now to. With what are your bill priests."
11553.0,Patient,yeah. yeah that's true.
705.0,Provider,"With a family member to, and especially when it comes to that unknown and you're so scared because you don't know what's going to happen and it affects you and your family members. That sets off like a triage you know."
11553.0,Patient,yeah that's true. yeah it's like it's steeper than roommates because it's like you can't. can't just leave on the same level that I did with my old roommates. yeah.
705.0,Provider,"And so I know you said this week, and is it that you're probably going to be there at the House by yourself, for."
11553.0,Patient,"me and my brother, I think. Okay, and the dog."
705.0,Provider,"And it's your dog, one that you can take for a walk."
11553.0,Patient,"yeah Okay, he needs a lot of that he's like at phones and super energetic."
705.0,Provider,"said hey you know, maybe, maybe that's great that he he needs and so walk me, maybe welcome it and. yeah beneficial to. get out of the House being able, just to be like you know, take a take a mindful walk where you just start to look at the trees feel the wind. or listen to what's going on."
11553.0,Patient,"yeah. I did that one time last week, I think, with him, and it was really nice it's it's a little bit hard because he's aggressive with other dogs, so you know being really fig that's a lot. Of kind of stress having to control him when we come across other dogs but. We were able to avoid them for the most part, and so, when there were no other dogs around it was really peaceful and Nice."
705.0,Provider,Having to juggle you're like. Wait a minute.
11553.0,Patient,Okay yeah exactly okay let's go now wait.
705.0,Provider,yeah yeah alert. alert yeah. well. i'm sure with it it's hard with a dog because their instincts are like. He sounds like the Alpha for.
11553.0,Patient,"he's way better than he used to be when we first got him I had kind of a traumatic experience, where I took him for a walk before we knew he was aggressive with other dogs, like our first week getting him and he had one of those like. What are they called like the chain colors but the ones with the Spikes. And I didn't realize that those were in pieces and that they can like they're adjustable and they can come apart, so we saw another dog and he, like lurched and he actually broke it. And so, he didn't have a collar on anymore, so I had to just like hold him down and I didn't bring my phone because I was trying to be mindful so. I had no phone and I was just like holding my dog down trying to keep him from attacking another dog, and it was awful it was just like super freaky seeing him like that, though. But i've worked through it at this point so it's been. Three or four years now and. So that walk that I took with him last week, which actually it was the first time i've walked him on my own, since that happened so."
705.0,Provider,Do you CESAR.
11553.0,Patient,The dog yeah actually.
705.0,Provider,"yeah reminds me of you, describing like the red zone and how a dog and so on, and."
11553.0,Patient,"He we learned that he's only aggressive when he's on a leash because he feels out of control. So he's afraid and when he's awfully she's fine so we still have to walk him on leash, of course, but learning that helped us learn that he's not like aggressive at heart he's just afraid. Which means that he's able to be trained. So we're able to kind of control it, for the most part, now, which is nice."
705.0,Provider,"mm hmm and that part two, are you then, if you already know that with the dogs, they just don't get as close I mean."
11553.0,Patient,Come yeah exactly we cross the street I pulled him back I make him sit and look at me and then it's okay. Yes.
705.0,Provider,yeah that breaking the red zone really focus here.
11553.0,Patient,yeah exactly like I know this is happening it's okay.
705.0,Provider,i'm like I relate to that.
11553.0,Patient,yeah totally.
705.0,Provider,zone and where each chapter let's focus what.
11553.0,Patient,yeah someone's got to be like hold on.
705.0,Provider,yeah. Where they you know some of the animals specialist say that we are our pets that our pets take on our. Personnel eat.
11553.0,Patient,yeah i've only ever had super anxious dogs.
705.0,Provider,You can relate. In you're like hey. i'll see. You yeah yeah like we're in this together.
11553.0,Patient,we're gonna make it work totally.
705.0,Provider,yeah.
11553.0,Patient,made it this far you don't know as much about the weirdness of the world as me and you're going to make it through.
705.0,Provider,What type of dog is he.
11553.0,Patient,He we got him DNA tested actually so he's mostly German shepherd and then he's husky and malamute and. Labrador and Wolf.
705.0,Provider,that's a nice mix and yeah.
11553.0,Patient,yeah.
705.0,Provider,wow.
11553.0,Patient,super smart and just like a big door it's. Really funny.
705.0,Provider,that's cool i'm glad that you have animals are supportive. yeah back well they do kind of but non judgmental.
11553.0,Patient,"Usually, no yeah we actually have you ever seen the dog that has the buttons that they push and they like speak using the buttons. super cool it was created by the speech therapist and she made like buttons so that instead of guessing what your dog wants, they can actually communicate to you, using words. And so we've started training him to use those so now he pushes a button when he wants to go outside and it says outside. And it's really cool."
705.0,Provider,"wow It just shows you how intelligent, he is."
11553.0,Patient,"it's amazing and they can like there's this dog called bunny the dog and she's learned, like the concept of animal versus human and emotions like she knows how to say she's mad, and she knows the names of everyone in the House it's incredible."
705.0,Provider,it's so neat. Right amazing. yeah wow.
11553.0,Patient,it's really crazy.
705.0,Provider,So she punches a button and it says outside. And is it like a little keyboard or.
11553.0,Patient,"it's like a it's a foam pad she created her own thing she calls them textiles, so they have like. Six sides and their titles that piece together they look like something you'd find in a preschool classroom or something but they're really, really cool it's worth looking it up she's on YouTube and everything."
705.0,Provider,I will. So neat.
11553.0,Patient,That was what my parents got me for my birthday actually was the tiles for Vincent or dog.
705.0,Provider,Now that Vincent knows outside.
11553.0,Patient,huh.
705.0,Provider,Do you build on any other of the buttons.
11553.0,Patient,yeah we're supposed to do. play next so that he can like asked when he wants to play.
705.0,Provider,"What a neat thing that is. crazy It is crazy and like wow Now you can communicate with him, he can communicate with you."
11553.0,Patient,"Why, it makes the relationships so different."
705.0,Provider,yeah which then distresses him and he's may be able to have experience more joy and.
11553.0,Patient,yeah totally. yeah just more closeness.
705.0,Provider,"hi i'm like maybe we just need tiles. that's the answer. To everything, yes, yes. Today is the love fun. yeah."
11553.0,Patient,"Yes, I love button on bunnies she can say love you it's so cute. Great."
705.0,Provider,And that one's called funny. wow amazing it is and what a neat skill to that now you've learned this now you're applying it with your dog. Now you're doing on it and is this a passion.
11553.0,Patient,"i've actually thought about going into speech pathology before with people. And i'm like in schools, because I really I love language I like I speak French, and I am learning Italian and I just like I really love language and accents and teaching i've also thought about going into teaching in general, so maybe."
705.0,Provider,"yeah and that communication piece to, as you know, we were talking about prep work before you even go into work. front language does it affect you different like if you say and and French something self soothing is it different than when you hear it in English for yourself."
11553.0,Patient,"that's a good question I don't know I feel like it would have to because my mom and I were talking about this, the other day, like when you saw somebody in French it's just such an inherently sassy language that it doesn't hurt as much. As just kind of expect people to SAS you all the time. it's like it's interesting how the emotions behind words don't translate the same."
705.0,Provider,Exactly.
11553.0,Patient,And just yeah that's worth a shot.
705.0,Provider,"yeah you've ever read attacks, and it can come out where it says Hello Hello can be misread so many different ways and we're. Right Sarah Hello hello, or like a Hello or. Hello."
11553.0,Patient,yeah or like Hello.
705.0,Provider,"Right right and then in in. In friendship would be what's Hello. Andrea see just the word even Sam module one i'm not saying it but. And then, what is it to for by is it on something like a blah. blah blah."
11553.0,Patient,"Which is like until I see you again, which is really sweet."
705.0,Provider,"Right, instead of English. goodbye hi."
11553.0,Patient,yeah totally. Later yeah. it's funny later means the same thing. But it doesn't come off the same way at all.
705.0,Provider,"No, no it's I agree the language just sounds more beautiful and has the. end to it."
11553.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
705.0,Provider,well.
11553.0,Patient,that's really interesting.
705.0,Provider,"yeah now, it was it Vincent is your dog. Yes, Vincent can learn maybe not only the English word for outside. word for. Expanding."
11553.0,Patient,My dad and my brother would hate that.
705.0,Provider,"Oh, I think that would be Q, that your."
11553.0,Patient,Next door neighbors are French and their dogs speak English and. what's really crazy.
705.0,Provider,Exactly how even commands for people who aren't language with the canines I know someone was using German and that's the dog would know the responses.
11553.0,Patient,it's so cool. yeah I remember. Like thinking that was really weird when I was in France that I couldn't just tell a dog to sit because they wouldn't know. They don't speak English.
705.0,Provider,mm hmm. But now you know. Now yeah gonna be able to go back and be like oh I got this.
11553.0,Patient,"still feels weird, though."
705.0,Provider,"Absolutely yeah. Well, I am glad that you know. Just you're soaking it all in you're managing Emily and it's like if I even probably would look back at some of the things that maybe a month ago. And I think was the I think at one point withdrawing from the meds."
11553.0,Patient,You were feeling yeah.
705.0,Provider,which was you know even self harm and things like that were coming up for you. yeah when's the last time he even had any of those thoughts.
11553.0,Patient,"The last time I had him and they lasted was a long time ago, but I have a couple of days ago I started having a little bit of that I was able to fight it, but it did come up a little bit."
705.0,Provider,yeah but you find it. What did you tell yourself.
11553.0,Patient,"that's not true, was the biggest one and you've gotten through this before. and Things are changing and. You couldn't have imagined how much things would change at one point, and here you are."
705.0,Provider,that's exactly like progress that's exactly where okay every now and then they come in here's how i'm going to counteract it.
11553.0,Patient,"Now, really."
705.0,Provider,you're saying it's like spot on. it's like and did you even have to really think about it.
11553.0,Patient,"And no, no, I didn't really that's a really good point."
705.0,Provider,"yeah that ants you have different types of answers now, instead of automatic negative thoughts your neutralizing thoughts."
11553.0,Patient,yeah exactly. yeah.
705.0,Provider,"And it changes the outcome, then."
11553.0,Patient,yeah definitely.
705.0,Provider,you're able to carry about that day and not you know it's like okay. yeah at this.
11553.0,Patient,"yeah that's true. One thing i've been like struggling with this week, in particular, is using my phone, like all the time and not feeling like I have control over when I use my phone do you have any tips for that."
705.0,Provider,"throw it up, I know. it's it's different techniques will work it and one of them, I know that's helpful is time limitation when the alarm. goes off because I can use my phone to Google and once you Google and then that goes into tick."
11553.0,Patient,tock yeah.
705.0,Provider,turns into etsy and then.
11553.0,Patient,or whatever everything reminds you of something that you could be doing.
705.0,Provider,"Right and you can be chasing that, like all day long. And yes, knowing that that you want to change that's important and now what type of limitations, do you feel you know that you want to put on that, like what do you think is is healthy for you."
11553.0,Patient,"um. I don't know what I think is healthy, necessarily, but I was scrolling tick tock for like six hours in a row, the other day, and I know that's not healthy."
705.0,Provider,"I was gonna say, can I just share six hours. yeah dedicating to tick tock, even though it has some good things they even have therapy on there that's great. It said. It was for sure me trying to distract myself, because it was the day that."
11553.0,Patient,"My dad and brother said that like I should be fine with them eating my food, I was just like I didn't know how to cope with my anger, so I just tried to shut it off."
705.0,Provider,"mm hmm card. You know. Maybe on those days, then, if it's something like that then would that be something that you know what it needs the situation if I need myself four hours if I need to distract for six hours. For right now, if that's the tool i'm going to use could that be okay, however, normal wise in my everyday life, I only want to allow. To be on my you know to be on the computer or to be on your phone for an hour or so and to set the alarm to remind you, when it's up."
11553.0,Patient,"But I. I want to have alternatives, I guess. I feel like I that's like the easiest way, I know, and I don't know without screen time how to get myself through it."
705.0,Provider,"yeah so now you're opening up that door with anger, just like you did before with having thoughts of wanting to harm yourself it's the same thing."
11553.0,Patient,it's like okay.
705.0,Provider,"With your anger, so you know distraction works, could you do that yourself in a different way."
11553.0,Patient,yeah probably.
705.0,Provider,yeah so now being in tune with when you're angry. If being on you know for the six hours you want to do something that you view is even healthier. what's going to get out some of that anger.
11553.0,Patient,I think exercising would probably help a lot.
705.0,Provider,yeah to me that matches up really well. yeah yeah get out some Cardio or something. yeah mm hmm. So exercise the next time something comes up is giving yourself permission to maybe go outside take a jog or do some exercise.
11553.0,Patient,yeah hard Brits doing it.
705.0,Provider,"Yes. Just like those thoughts, you were having before and you've learned to where it's starting because you practice this. you've practiced it and you've stayed dedicated to it. same thing with anger."
11553.0,Patient,And after yeah.
705.0,Provider,"Your size, you can come back to it later on to start to evaluate what was beneath the anger because anger usually surfaces, but if we look below like the iceberg it's usually heard or there's some form of shame, or something was below the anger."
11553.0,Patient,hmm that makes sense.
705.0,Provider,"And appreciating that and just be like okay Initially it was anger, but I really was hurt by it."
11553.0,Patient,I didn't feel yeah.
705.0,Provider,Our family heard me.
11553.0,Patient,yeah I don't feel like I used to get to anger quite so quickly. yeah oh.
705.0,Provider,I know how you are Emily but now that you're like aware of it and it's in your zone you're like. i'm going to start identifying this.
11553.0,Patient,yeah. I don't want to deal with it anymore.
705.0,Provider,"But that's good, but this is a lot of self growth. This is where you're really taking this opportunity to. discover how you navigate through the world how things affect you. yeah yes."
11553.0,Patient,"yeah. yeah I think the pandemic really brought to light a lot of like anger that I wasn't super used to experiencing because I in the beginning. Like you know March and April of last year I was working at trader joe's and they really didn't take the pandemic seriously, and so I just spent like every waking moment so angry and I. was not at all used to that and I think it kind of like. awakens that feeling for me. A little bit."
705.0,Provider,"yeah and that's where your insight is helpful, you know where you've taken a look at that and how I did and acknowledging and. You always are the one that has sometimes there's things that you want to change sometimes there's things that you want to eliminate the things that you want to add."
11553.0,Patient,yeah. that's true.
705.0,Provider,"Absolutely. I think, to i'm going to bring up my calendar."
11553.0,Patient,Last last.
705.0,Provider,"We talked I don't think we said it for. Our next one, is that song."
11553.0,Patient,I think we did only because when I called yesterday. They said that they saw the 23rd on the calendar.
705.0,Provider,"Okay, oh wait."
11553.0,Patient,"that's Wednesday, though that's kind of weird."
705.0,Provider,They said the 23rd of September.
11553.0,Patient,Oh i'm in June.
705.0,Provider,"Oh, you know what it's the first day I see it, thank you it's at 12 o'clock on Thursday."
11553.0,Patient,"yeah sorry i'm still looking to it, yes, the 23rd."
705.0,Provider,"So the 23rd on Thursday. Yes, then after that. i'm just going through."
11553.0,Patient,"30th I don't know if he actually scheduled it, though."
705.0,Provider,"I see that 30th which is great 12 o'clock. And then, what I was going to ask you, with. October. If you wanted to start scheduling in October, if 12 o'clock the time that you, you like, where I can see if that would work for you."
11553.0,Patient,yeah I think 12 is still good.
705.0,Provider,"And how are you feeling about the frequency of how often we meet do you feel. The once a week is something that you want to continue, do you feel couple of times a month."
11553.0,Patient,um I think I still feel like once a week feels good and.
705.0,Provider,"i'm glad that you know yourself and that I want to again, this is what we're here for. let's see to then. If we're going to keep it at 12 o'clock on Friday, I have a 12 o'clock so that unfortunately would not work."
11553.0,Patient,On Friday.
705.0,Provider,To the group's I do at eight o'clock and a.
11553.0,Patient,Nice.
705.0,Provider,"Well let's see, though um."
11553.0,Patient,"Well, what about on Thursday."
705.0,Provider,"Okay, so let's see so the next okay so September the 30th were scheduled for o'clock and then i'll look at the next Thursday, which would be the seventh. yeah yeah you know that would be great in late because October than the seven I have the 12 o'clock available right now. Surely. Surely go ahead and schedule that. yeah Okay, and then, if we look at the seventh the next would be the 14th. I do have on the 14th. i'm learning if I do this ahead, if you like, the same time that I can usually do it if I project, a month."
11553.0,Patient,yeah that makes sense.
705.0,Provider,mm hmm.
11553.0,Patient,easier to keep the same time that way.
705.0,Provider,"Right and so, then let me look at the 21st 21st I am seeing where I can do the 21st at 12pm. And then that would bring us to the 28th."
11553.0,Patient,I can do that.
705.0,Provider,"Okay, great, then I will book all these for you so basically, you have the other ones, and then October it's the 714 21st and 28th and then the other ones in September. Okay. That will be great, and you know this week, I know that there's some things that you're going to be working on and. When you need to take that break go take them to now."
11553.0,Patient,Okay.
705.0,Provider,Absolutely well good catching up and I look forward to seeing you next week and hearing how you're doing.
11553.0,Patient,"Okay, thank you."
705.0,Provider,All right.
11553.0,Patient,bye.
705.0,Provider,"I was patient and sharing she's not suicidal she had a fleeting thought she has done, really well at making progress to quickly replace it so still. low risk on the assessment for suicide still monitoring each week, but this week she's saying it happened at the beginning, when a family member was having surgery. But it was a quick second she didn't have a plan no intent, it was a fleeting thought that she quickly replaced and patient also has her safety plan which she is using."
