252.0,Provider,I let me know.
14987.0,Patient,"They bounced around a few times yes, I thought was running late. Just because i'm in the main room and everyone will be trying to come up in the next few minutes."
252.0,Provider,"I thought you were seven, let me see."
14987.0,Patient,"As Paul they bounced it back and forth a few times yesterday, and I was like Well, I can do the 637 she likes i'll be reading this and i'm meeting."
252.0,Provider,pretty sure that they have to hit. seven. yeah. Seven 630 to seven is what they had you.
14987.0,Patient,Oh OK.
252.0,Provider,I bad.
14987.0,Patient,"or either okay that's. My bad okay. Oh, so what time."
252.0,Provider,What time you're meeting.
14987.0,Patient,meetings at eight. But dinner has to be shoehorned in there and in between so.
252.0,Provider,You can eat while you're in session with me i'm perfectly okay with that.
14987.0,Patient,"Oh no, I have to help cook it. Oh yeah yeah and the kitchens, right here so everyone's like downstairs. I have, I have my partner's youngest and. Her boyfriend are living with us and they're basically in my space, so my partner and I live. right here."
252.0,Provider,yeah.
14987.0,Patient,"and see on the other side of this but and that's our but, and then the bathroom is right in front of me. And then the kitchens right on the other side, so i'm in the on the main area that often than downstairs is your shop and and then the other space that would be like where I would normally have had this computer desk but. uh huh living there now so."
252.0,Provider,"Okay well let's just kick in so you can go eat. and see where you're at, and then we can turn around and. We can have another session early next week or."
14987.0,Patient,"Whatever they're trying to find I had a. Tuesday I can't do because the group and then Monday I think you were not available so that was that was the issue. Would you go so anyway. check in so. I am well today. Today was actually kind of a lazy day just spent a lot of it on the couch watching TV, which is something I used to feel real guilty about, as you can tell by my expressions, but I actually didn't feel guilty about it, I have to string some lights up on the in the rafters for my personal. it's not then no one else is relying on it and switch a battery thing out for my partner on Christmas decoration she put in which i'll do after this after the meeting tonight, and then I go back to work tomorrow for the next. Four days. and Now that's. The other. My schedule not my home during. The. I mentioned yesterday in group that uh I don't know what next month is going to look like because of scheduling changes i've got more information, after the group that the bidding i'm supposed to be part of this no longer happening. And so i've been offered an opportunity to work in a different part of the Community paramedic program, which is good because I really don't want to go back to the ambulance partially. partially is physically I haven't heard anyone in 910 months, and I say it's kind of Nice. yeah I haven't really my hips hurt and sitting too much, but that's you know that's something I can change. So this other thing is the. opiate Response Group which it's not a group it's an individual it's a new team they're putting up and i'm very excited about it, ironically it's The one area of substance. That, I have no i've never had a relation with relationship with and i'm actually not interested in having one directly but. it's it's interesting because a lot of the people I work with now are predominantly. Mental health but methamphetamine and sometimes alcohol alcohol is not as prevalent as it once was it's really been eclipsed by the other two, at least during the day. When I worked nights it was booze all the time, probably because you didn't see her window these they disappeared in the dark alleyways with during the day they're seeing and now it's fentanyl too so it's like a home run hit. I did a lot of work in the Castro so there's a huge presence of math there, which is where I encountered it so. That there's a little part of me that's a little. Strangely kind of. Call it gives me pause because I feel i'm not playing to a strength going to the opiate response team, however. I work with some really awesome people who would be supporting the peers I don't know if you're familiar rams. Richmond area management resort it's it's a peer based program and it is also supposedly one of the first programs in the country where it is paying. People in a professional status for their career based experience for the lived experiences so on the team I work with one of the supervisors is a former opiate. addicted individual and she is awesome and I love that I get the chance, I would have the chance of working with her, but not side by side she'd be like following up which I really think she should be leading. Because there's nothing like a familiar voice to kind of help. Lower ones. defenses a little bit, especially when they're coming out of an odd well or opiate toxicities they're calling it now. And they're being surrounded by people who mostly look like me and have no understanding of what they're going through in the moment I ELISE can try to empathize you know what it what it's like or sympathize but. Anyway, so it's an opportunity that has been floated is not guaranteed at this time seniority allows me a high probability of maintaining a similar work schedule, where I am and then to get that spot. If not, I go back to the ambulance. for a short period of time, and then we would rebid in the spring, rather than in December. I don't know what that's going to look like and I don't know if I want to go back to the end that's a pretty. I left it in a bad state and I entered into. This quest for mental health and and re entering sobriety recovery because of how things were going in the ambulance world after. 17 years ambulance, so I am have a. knee jerk kind of resistance to going back there because I lifted poorly and did not ever have an opportunity to kind of clean that up internally returning that environment also it is by far the most toxic environment, it has ever been right right now, it has moved to a space that is. Not quite violent but it's on the cusp of it and our departments my employer and the allied agencies we work with. are not. I feel strongly are not addressing it, and the only reason i'm able to say that is because where i'm working now working with some mental health professionals really seeing how unhealthy, the environment is and my co workers. who've come over to the Community paramedic program two thirds of them are very challenged with what we're doing mostly because it's a slow down. yeah the clinicians are being told by their supervisors. You know if you need to just step away for 20 minutes walk away from the Van because they can't make you run a call if you're not standing there, which is correct. And i'm like this is great and they're asking me why don't you do the same i'm like well, I have an ear Bud always in so I always hear dispatch. And that's very hard thing for me to turn off because that is, that is a that's a 911 mentality and I am have a. Very few people who come to realize, I am not working in 911 day. But i'm but our masters don't really get that, even though they said it, they said you're not and I want your attention not supposed to look like that so it's. That is the big thing on my mind these days. The last two weekends i've had i've actually not spent a lot of time thinking about it, I just realized that now is it's kind of coming out and i'm talking to you. I made a point when i'm talking to my sponsor that if i'm not leaving work to not be talking about work unless something about work has occurred in the moment that is needs to be addressed. sort of a more disciplined compartmentalization not compartmentalization but a discipline like he's asking how today went and I wasn't work today so talking about work. With the incorrect. So yeah that's something that some of this is rolled out, and on top of it, one of the my immediate captain and just found out his house burned down last night, so that really sucks and I don't know what to do about that. But. It kind of dovetails into our discussion last week or two weeks ago with regards to triggers list, and it was one of the things that that. That that fits in that in the ambulance world as part of it, but ironically, one of the things I listed was and it just came up this has always been there. through all the many years is emulates monster said it perfectly, the only thing worse than. Bad fortune for an alcoholic or an addict is good fortune. And so the end of a good week. Is on my list. And i've had. Several of those lately so it's Those are my Fridays i'm coming home it's always like. This would be used to it was never really a drink or anything that that mentality didn't I was not working her in the workforce, when I got sober from alcohol, but this time around for like. You know I could do there's a whole laundry list of things I could do reality there's one thing. So."
252.0,Provider,"i'm glad that you're building your church lists and you're identifying those things because triggers aren't always bad. that's the. The second thing. There is more fentanyl and methamphetamines these days. And so there's really that. That piece that you identify. And that you have no love and CCP. it's see CAP in California, they always have day training. secrets so. And that is for substance abuse, and so you can sign up and do a day training on opioid use and abuse and learn what you need to to be the best at this job you know that you can you know as far as the logistics go is op as far as opiates go, but as far as the addiction itself."
14987.0,Patient,Not a lot of difference.
252.0,Provider,"Right, you know. The only difference is a with methamphetamines without the fentanyl the detox is eating and sleeping. motions are everywhere, for a while brain is everywhere, for a while. Right temperature hi um but with opioids it's a complete physical detox."
14987.0,Patient,yeah I was. In the meetings in the group's.
252.0,Provider,holding their skin.
14987.0,Patient,"In fact I go to see him a predominantly a on occasion these days and. it's it, it was never lost me that na was created predominately by a heroin addict once upon a time and. And even today crystal meth went and found its own place because it didn't because that's so polar opposite, even though what's happening under the hood and and the reality is recovery, you can drop the the the substance and no one would know alcohol versus opiates versus pencils versus."
252.0,Provider,"I wish they would and that's just my personal opinion, and believe. That because no matter what and addiction, whether its food or sex or whatever it is, yes, the the behaviors in general, not specific behaviors but in general right the guilt, the shame the demoralisation all of that, that the self worth the the all of it. What you have to do to get it. You know what I mean all of it, there are similarities to it."
14987.0,Patient,"yeah yeah i'm finding that a the reason why we choose certain things, maybe, maybe a little different I don't know how much that society versus is probably societal more than anything, i'll call is very acceptable tobacco is very acceptable. I picked up literally with a little voice in the back of my head saying. Like knowing the severity of what I was doing, in fact, to the point where I always said opiates were the worst i'm like i'm not sure which depends, who you talk to either way they both have less than 20%. Long term recovery rates and a whereas an A you know bunch of people looking mostly like me sounding like like me, at least where I was coming from you know drugs are bad Okay, and I always say that as a joke, because I was one of the very few drinkers he's very few but uh. I knew I can learn. The textbook and and and. Some of the related ability with regards to the opiate use it's just it's the it's that little part of me that wants to say you're not good enough to do this job you know or actually it's probably a fear of changing. The position i'm in which I, I went from one of the worst spots where I had a team with a a social worker who. My minimal understanding suggested this, but a couple of professionals like she's a narcissist and that's why you can't work with her and I kept taking it down as a personal and my part my part my part. Which wasn't the best way to go. And now the person or. Two people. Well, the two the two people who've taken over, since I have one is trying to actively leave the program absolutely cannot thinks working with civilians is a terrible idea and and. hates it she even said guys always talk about that that girl that was blamed that girl that woman, that person should I was, I was because guys were just being households and then I met her and realized she exists. The guy was whether i'm working with right now, and the peer. who I know through cma before it when this program and started is now back on my unit and i'm working with a different person. Because it. Was point to this Oh, and so currently I went from this terrible situation to now my social worker is one of is becoming one of our close friends, but with a friend, long before. She even started social work, her, she was supposed to be our neighbor and her her her former boyfriend was my partner and minds really close friend. Of the dead, unfortunately, but it was this thing that really kind of tie this all together closer and then now she works with me and I have these peers that are. awesome people and i'm like in this situation, where everyone acknowledges that Richard went from like a total of zero situation to like this home run situation and there's a part of me that's really kind of. afraid to leave, I have a lot of comfort in what I know and with the decrease in my anxiety, I still have, I know what I like to know where i'm comfortable and I get anxious a little. It doesn't have the weight at once had, but at the same time it's still there, so I should be clear that it's, not that I am inadequate or incapable it's just that I want to feel that i'm in an adequate and incapable it's a normal self sabotage. Because reality is i'll take the spot."
252.0,Provider,"You know what am I. The only thing that is guaranteed in life is change. we're always changing things are always changing or some of them scary changes yeah oh my God yeah, but if we don't try it. we're always going to be wondering. Right. And I think. I think you're one of the best men for the job because you have that inter empathy you know what it's like to be you know you know how it feels on the inside. You have that empathetic piece that most people don't don't have if they haven't been through it or lost 11 from it, or you know. And that's vitally important. You want to help somebody and you know that is struggling with drugs and alcohol come from where they come from, because if you're just a Booker somebody that's only got knowledge from the book. They can pick out a mile away."
14987.0,Patient,"You said it, I do see it and I. You know I don't expect to connect with every person I connect with, but there are some people in fact the clinician and the and the peer. To peer work with the most as a former gang person who is a involved a murder, when he was young, I don't know the details. I just know he's spent about 20 years and we just wrote letters, because his parole officers recommended he come off parole because he's like this guy is so cool you would never know it and. And the other peer is a she went to a movie in Colorado. A few years ago and happened to be in the in the theater when somebody shot it up. And that was her experience and then the other one is a crystal meth formerly on housed in the in the Castro, for years, and we now encounter his former boyfriend is a strong word, but people he used to. hang out and run with and so. there's this void in the alcohol world and every now and then we do get like an old fashioned, just like a drunk and i'll sit there and it's weird because I just start talking to them and I don't try to make an assumption of authority it's just. A certain area where I feel very comfortable nothing alcohol alcohol, especially and the. Peer or the clinician is send more than once there's like violence is kind of crazy oh every now and then you just sort of with certain people and it's not always just alcohol it's just sometimes there's things just connect with someone. yeah or you feel like it is on occasion, it has been one sided and I I feel in playing to a strength. Those are very gratifying contacts, they are not vital to my job. They are like the gravy the bonus, I do not mistake that for working with people in recovery as a my time is supposed to my paid time of professional time, but it is one of those things that makes. It gives a value to the job that I have not felt in a very long time. I had a lot of it when I work nights and hated working nights because what it did to my life and how it turned everything upside down for the first few years and Mike miles 40 at this job but um. it's a. it's probably a career path thing i'm going to be convincing to my actions are saying that. it's a it's a division in our department that is brand new and it is not being accepted well because they're not on fire and they. Were you're trying not to use ambulances will thank God, but the what the hell, are we doing in the game if they're not on fire, they don't need an ambulance then we shouldn't be there at all and. The public feel differently, but in San Francisco to it so it's one of those things I agree we are we encouraging are really. You know all the arguments for sure you've heard, and I have them in the moment but at the same time it plays to something to feel strongly about."
252.0,Provider,"I think that you know. Whichever direction you'll go. you'll be led there. you'll know. You know just be true to. be true to you, internally, you know. don't self sabotage stay away from all of those thoughts in your head, you know that say that you're not smart enough not good enough can't do the job. Because oh crap. or disease likes to make us feel that way. Right. Because you can do the job. in both directions that's The funny part about it. Right."
14987.0,Patient,"Now, but more than once, I. thought to myself seconds and inches we had a probe he recently, who was released because he was found in a state of overdose. From probably not no I wasn't on the call and I don't know the person who worked for one of the other ambulance companies in his left, because you got hired with us and. yeah they have the ambulance responded somebody recognized him, unfortunately, and once that connections made i'm thinking, and it was. me a year ago, not even a year ago. I left dispatch wow my last day using because I was giving a four hour break I didn't know, we had where our breaks well yeah you're good just stay in the city, and so I just went down the street to person's House I knew and to. Have a party, and you know it wasn't lost on me that, if anything, went wrong between the math and the G was completely incapable of responding to doing my job and. And i'm hearing about this other guy a few months ago was found and overdosed and brought back and was released as should win a provision any kind of Iraqi. seconds and this always comes to mind."
252.0,Provider,"And I much so so. I think that whatever direction that you're supposed to go that door is going to open wider than the rest. And you're going to know. You got to make sure that you stay in your program of recovery right and dead smack in the Center. And remember that in today's world there's. A na support groups is one piece of recovery right and once once you doesn't fit for everybody. Right, and so you have to remember that today there's other things there's. Oh, my God depending on your. On your ethnicity you've got recovery for that. You know web variety you've got that people that don't believe in God you've got that. You know what I mean there are so many different avenues to go for recovery. You know today where they didn't have that. Years ago. You know. So you have to keep yourself open the mat Program. You know, for many, many years I didn't believe in medication assisted treatment, but. there's like a whole generation that was being taken out. Literally taken out all generation. That program pop that's where he had up and all of a sudden these the same generation they're being saved. The building their lives they're becoming productive members of society they're working. they're on a school they're getting their lives back. heroin and opioid addiction is. it's a tough devil to crack. And I don't know who the genius was the thought about putting fentanyl with methamphetamines but that's the dual dual level right there. So, remember that there's a public huge piece of it that you do know. don't ever think that you don't know because you do inside and out. Right, you may need a little more education on the opioid side, but who doesn't it's new you know new things coming up without every day. But keep yourself open. and walk through the door that opens the widest for you. don't think that you are just you know you can relate to these people, but you can also relate to the other ones to you just don't know it yet. Okay."
14987.0,Patient,"Good Sydney lecture recently where they were talking about the sort street opiate response team and the other variations of that model across the country, it was a Arizona somewhere in Arizona new Mexico. la and of course cahoots up in Seattle, and they have a component of that, and it was all the physicians and a Co worker of mine was presenting guys awful he is also one of the few people who's like the furthest from. The problem experientially but he's the one who who can take parts and write together proposal and the former. Soviet user that I was referencing his supervisor at the peers is like Why is he in charge of this program because he wrote it it's his program and he gave a presentation was painful, the only thing that was as bad as this presentation was all the doctors talking about it. And, and the stats and and you know, trying to understand it sent and that's how a position based lecture is folks to be I mean there's the. Hard science look at the numbers crunch it up how we doing it and, like, I was trying, I asked a question anonymously cuts through a zoom so there's no, it was just the presenters and then our questions in text. And I was asking about and down out of sedona or whatever they were talking about how law enforcement tends to be the first initiator of narcan. And that's the case in San Francisco to their their more often than not, the ones who discovered but uh I was asking do you find that the presence of law enforcement alters or maybe skewing your numbers or or or affecting the outcome, and it really challenged by that. And I was like well you know the uniform alone is a problem and and they recognize there's a lot of public health specialties in there, who have had that discussion, but it was just very hard, because there's no data. My coworker could not grasp it and I was just one of those things where I remember thinking at the time i'm all there's, not a single person in here, who has experienced or is able from their position to do utilize experience if they had it. In America, that would not be problematic because I wasn't about to jump out and say oh yeah. But at the same time, and just to Brett recognizing you with the best of interests. they're very far away from the problem and with our clinicians sometimes are the ones talking and you can tell the client is like who are you and why are you talking to me and. And all this while it to me and asked me, she said something like, why do they ask that I might because somebody wants to be like they're doing something I don't remember what my answer was very not PC and was just off the cuff. And she looked at me and she's like Oh, you get it, I can't remember what it was, and she was a character. and"
252.0,Provider,And that's a good example for explaining right there. If you if you get it more than what you will live.
14987.0,Patient,forever because he's running all around me right now.
252.0,Provider,"You know. and You know, for the past five or six years, probably longer than that narcan has been handed. To it bright heart health prescribes everybody can carry it with you put it in your glove compartment. You know what I mean if you're if you're going to relapse or you're at you know, a friend's house and they're using in there, you know OD give it to him it's very easy to use, so we promote it in every possible way that we can we were."
14987.0,Patient,"I was in a sex positive group that we would have parties. And I was the one who brought narcan was like training on grant opiates are not a not something that exist in that environment intentionally is mostly G cannabis and. canes a math because and then hetero Community that's not something that's very common yet. But there were people using substance oh Ecstasy molly you know feel good guys and G but marquez workers but they're like hey we want this, because we know that's out there and really it's because maybe you bought the wrong thing. anyway. And for the longest time they never used any of it i've not heard about changing, but it was something that people who are trying to be more forward thinking we're or. inclusive as the language that was used very often. Like you know we're not here to judge we're here to support and have a good time and a good time becomes problem, then we have to look at that differently, but didn't come that way anyway."
252.0,Provider,"yeah and again just remember that you know fentanyl is all over the place. It could be you know created into Ecstasy molly you have no idea, you have no idea you're not buying it from somebody that can guarantee and certify the what's in what you're taking. And so that's why it is important that you hear that narcan. period. No other no other reason. You know I promoted 100% and I carry one of my car, you know most definitely I think it's vitally important it'll help save lives we're not it's not there to judge. You know, in any way, shape or form. Is there to help."
14987.0,Patient,"You know, most of the most of the ideas we encounter in the street, are there already being treated by other people in the street, whether it's fellow. Users or it's somebody who came by like the urban alchemy, or the ambassadors or whatnot the startup coven that was some. My suspicion or found a handful of individuals who one kid dead three days in front of his gaming system which is powered off the store the controller in his hand and he had the froth which tells us it's a respiratory related. Death yeah or suggestive of that and as parents around them, because his roommates quarantine elsewhere. And we're looking at the scene and like everyone's like now, we don't know what's this Saturday wow and Mike look around the corner and the firefighter myself looking at it and there's. brownish powder whitish powder looks like a good big cocaine probably had a lot of fentanyl in it and boy had no experience it was. opiate naive and took just a little bump and before he even got the game going it was already dead and didn't know it, and the sad part is that some well who knows, but uh we saw that a bunch of the beginning. it's it's everywhere."
252.0,Provider,"covered really you know it hit the the recovery Community hard. Because recovery really you know it's about Community and it's about being together and it's about being able to communicate and be around people that are you know got the better stronger than you to help you, through your tough times. And when that was taken away. There was so many people that relapse that died that you know what I mean it just it took a hard hit."
14987.0,Patient,us what I where I haven't haven't come back.
252.0,Provider,"it's going to take out. Its currency for a while, but anyways it's been a great conversation so continue on your triggers. As you as they come up you continue writing those down because the great part about it is the income up at any time. you'll find triggers that you don't didn't even know you had. And that's the great part about it when you work on it a little bit of time and you're self aware of it. that's when we find the ones that hide. That usually can take people out. You know the how many times i've heard I didn't even know that that was a trigger for me. I had no idea. So we do it in a way that is relaxing self awareness day to day we built this list, and they pop out the weirdest times. So write them down let's compile that list so that you are completely aware and ready okay. All right, so. In two weeks."
14987.0,Patient,yeah yes okay.
252.0,Provider,let's do that really fast before I let you run out the door.
14987.0,Patient,So that'd be the week of the 19th.
252.0,Provider,"Oh, I mean maybe go so."
14987.0,Patient,"I have, I have Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday of that week."
252.0,Provider,I was.
14987.0,Patient,Friends first day wow. Oh yeah We broke up.
252.0,Provider,"Okay. All right, so what did I say."
14987.0,Patient,"Week of the 19th it looks like so I have something on the 19th all day, so I have a Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday 20th 21st 22nd 21st is no because that's the group. And so the the 20th or the 22nd Monday or Wednesday."
252.0,Provider,I listed the 20th I have. From 1pm one in the afternoon on open.
14987.0,Patient,let's do one in the afternoon. that's for one hour correct.
252.0,Provider,"Yes, sir."
14987.0,Patient,"That looks which. Is. very hard. For Rebecca 1979 correct. Once again, that timing is going to be 113 or 1400. triggers list right okay. All right."
252.0,Provider,"now understand that you know, once you bring it to your list to the tables next week, know that you're always going to be building on that. All right."
14987.0,Patient,"My sponsor and I have talked about that. It has grown and grown the trunk something that don't even look at him like, why is this here. But uh because triggers was a term that was. challenging for me for a long time that was a word that got mocked. I got sober when they were talking about. people wanting to spank their inner child and stuff and not understanding that that was. Probably because of the 80s and the Russia of psychology and pop psychology and self help books in and how that had some logical felt that diluted the message and so that's the, the environment, I came up in, and unfortunately it really created a prejudice against what was probably. absolutely vital thing for me to address, which was mental health, and it was not addressed and culminated into what's going on now. I do not in any way, shape or form. not take oh sorry. hold on hold on a SEC, if you can hear me."
