760.0,Provider,Nice to meet you.
17566.0,Patient,Nice to meet you too.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, the purpose of this session is just to. kind of hear from you and find out what's been going on for you what what's your some of your struggles have been things that you want to work on. Okay, so i'm going to be asking you some questions. Okay, but before we get started in that process can you just share with me what you would like to get out of treatment what, what is your hope for that."
17566.0,Patient,"treatment as far as like like therapy wise or or the medicines or. I think my situation is a little bit of a unique situation um it's not from the doctor was talking to it's not like the normal situation so. My my doctor put on put me on all these for so many years and I chose to get off of them because. All it was. All the medicines that I was on to I felt miserable, and so I chose to get off of it, he and I got rid of that doctor because he's he's terrible. doctor."
760.0,Provider,"What type of medicine, are we talking about."
17566.0,Patient,"He had me on it was pain management, so he had man oxy code on and then he also had me on so my which come to find out you're supposed to be on for three weeks, he had me on that for five years, so the more investigating I did. The more miserable I felt I started putting two and two together, he also had me on gabba penton. I just realized that something's not right, and so I I got in contact with someone, and I was able to get help off the medicines, because it was impossible to do it myself like I tried to like wind down and i'd feel miserable. So for me it's not like ever since i've been off of them, I have no, no, I don't want to ever touch that again like there's no cravings it's nothing like that I just. I just wanted my life back as far as like being able to do things so I felt tired all the time, I felt like i'm just just down like it couldn't do anything and I, my pain was so bad that I couldn't do anything either so."
760.0,Provider,What is the cause of your pain.
17566.0,Patient,"So I have been in three really bad car accident, so I have so many things going on with my neck and spine, but on top of that, they do think I have fibromyalgia and ra as well, so between all those kind of mixed together like just kind of made me miserable but. To be honest, since i've been off of those medicines i'm feeling a lot better, so I I feel like it was definitely playing into like. The Doc the new doctors are telling me it only works for a little bit and then your body. get used to it, and then, if you're still taking the same dose it's not helping you and I was feeling head to toe pain everywhere every day and it's like I couldn't take more, because then I take more than prescribed and then i'm in trouble."
760.0,Provider,With I. Just gonna keep needing more and more. down that path.
17566.0,Patient,"yeah and I. I mean i've seen so many horror stories like that people go to the street, do I just too terrified to do stuff like that so. I just kept sticking it out and telling the doctor look I feel worse and worse and he's not listening to me. So I had to get out of there and find a doctor that actually cared about me so basically i'm left with I feel like now, if I left with trying to feel better I feel like I gained weight, when I was on them, and especially on. The government particular like pretty quickly, and so I feel like that's probably my biggest thing like I feel like I was for the for those happen, maybe like so i've been on for five years, I say it didn't get bad till about almost. See like three years and. that's when I started to feel really bad and that's when I started to gain weight, so I stopped working out completely the doctor told me stop working out because I couldn't even I could barely move. So, then, that kind of made me feel like down like I you know i've gained weight, I have four kids like I feel guilty like I can't do the things that I normally used to do. So I feel like i'm kind of that's what I want back I want my life back to before, where I was able to do those things and. You know, like not some days i'd be in bed, where I couldn't get out of bed, because I was in so much pain so. um that's what I would like to change, maybe i'd like to feel good again."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so physically good again."
17566.0,Patient,Nice yeah.
760.0,Provider,"You know, held back with this terrible pain that you've been doing. Yes, Okay, so what medications are presently taking."
17566.0,Patient,got so they switched me to suboxone to get off of the. oxy. I chose and so i'm kind of out of breath when coach I.
760.0,Provider,Like i'm struggling right.
17566.0,Patient,"I choose to go off of the some of myself. Pretty dramatically pretty quickly, and so it is affected me pretty badly."
760.0,Provider,And what.
17566.0,Patient,"i'm having anxiety and I feel like I can't breathe so like and I always know like I have tingling in my hands and feet and when I would try to drop it before. I get those same symptoms like i'm super irritable thumb if I was doing fine was just switching to suboxone and going off the oxy like I was a miracle i'm shocked how good that works, but this is this has been hard so she put me on. kalani did this for blood pressure. So instead of today's my first day completely off the soma, so I am struggling a bit, but I took the quanta done to try to like help with that. And then I kept on the gabba penton just through the withdrawal process so i'm hoping to drop that as well, so basically right now i'm on suboxone a little bit of the clonidine when needed, and then gabapentin."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, and so I know this is your first day. Not taking one of those, but do you think this this this routine is working for you right now."
17566.0,Patient,"Absolutely like I just still excited to get off, I was taking five to the oxy codeine today in there 10 milligrams and then. Three of the Selma a day, which is our 350 milligram they're the highest one so taking eight pills a day, plus the gabba penton like I felt like I was always like tired and. And drugged up and it just actually at the end didn't even really feel drunk I feel tired and so right now I feel really good almost like the extreme opposite we're going to have too much energy like I I don't know what to do with it so i'm not sleeping. pretty much at all I wasn't really sleeping before but. Now i'm definitely not sleeping and, but it is good i'm i'm out all day now, whereas before like I didn't want to leave my house, so now I have so much energy to go do."
760.0,Provider,"Everything and and your pain right now the pain that got you in in this place where you took those medications To begin with, is is better now."
17566.0,Patient,"yeah that's the weird thing like she's she's gonna keep me on suboxone because i'm doing so well with it, like my pain daily, I would say, would be between six and eight every single day now i'm at like a two I mean. There will be certain times, where i'm like. One area particular that's an injury will hurt more than others, but in general, like it's not gotten, to the point of even like I would say at five at this point."
760.0,Provider,Well that's really great and. How long have you how long have you been. Taking suboxone.
17566.0,Patient,"I started it last Thursday is, for I went I went into I guess detox or whatever from the other things on Thursday."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so not quite a week."
17566.0,Patient,It seems like a long time so far.
760.0,Provider,To get your life back.
17566.0,Patient,yeah maybe yeah. Good yeah.
760.0,Provider,Okay well good So is there any other substances that you've been using. Other than than the medications that they want you to take nothing else.
17566.0,Patient,don't and I don't even have been drinking like probably seven or eight years I just don't like so no I don't I don't nothing.
760.0,Provider,"Okay okay good talk to me about you said you struggle with anxiety. Is that something that you experienced prior to these accidents, and all this whole. thing that's come on."
17566.0,Patient,"Baby when I have four kids and they're pretty close together an age, so when they were like when I had four kids under eight years old, I did struggle, a little bit with anxiety, but after that no not really I feel like. Right now, I feel like i'm not worried like that things are going to happen i'm more like just. Like anxious in the fact like I kind of like like I had a pre workout mixture like a tons of caffeine. I feel like I just like too much caffeine, or I feel like I gotta go go go and that makes me like like I feel like I can't breathe because of that."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, all right, so do you know, do you have any other coping skills that you that you know to do manage anxiety. Have you tried anything else."
17566.0,Patient,"Like when my kids were young I used to it, just like work out a lot but i'm i'm waiting to talk to the doctor tomorrow on that she said she thinks she can get me back working out again, which would be amazing it's going to hurt myself so i'm like kind of I."
760.0,Provider,"know you, you are you don't want to reenter anything yeah you always want to check. With the doctor, especially with your situation you're always going. To check with the doctor but you're hoping that that'll be a coping skill that you can."
17566.0,Patient,"yeah. Because I feel like right now I feel like I could mentally I feel like and because i'm feeling so good physically I feel like I could totally do that, but I do know that I felt, though, in the past and then. i'll hurt myself, however, I have been able to kind of like a clean freak and I like to clean my house constantly and sometimes I wasn't able to do that how I wanted to and i've been kind of like to like coping that way so just cleaning."
760.0,Provider,"A lot of my house or Okay, and that doesn't hurt you physically to. house. One day now."
17566.0,Patient,"It did a little bit, but in general, I know what I can and can't do."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, and Okay, so when you have this conversation with the doctor about exercise if it's not the exercise that you want it to be, I would encourage you to ask her. What exercises, do you think I can do is. Great like tone it down a little bit because exercise is really, really important in managing the symptoms of anxiety. yeah yes i'm sure you already kind of know that, but you know. It doesn't you know if your health condition or your your. Your chronic pain condition. is going to prevent you from doing what you want, find out what it is, you can do. And kind of like alter that if you if you need to so. Okay okay any other mental health struggles. knows it nothing, nothing."
17566.0,Patient,"I never. know I never really have in the past um I felt like for a bit right before I decided to do the see talk to kind of push in that. direction, I was feeling kind of like I mean I don't even know if I would use the word depressed because I don't want to take that away from what that means really is, I feel guilty saying that but i'm just kind of like. Like feeling like why me kind of thing like why can't I do this, I mean i'm audio well i'll be 40 next week, but i'm young Why is this happening to me and that kind of got me to like. say you know what i'm done, I think it is the medicine, I think that, like it can't just drastically change that quickly something's not right. So I feel like that's the only time i've seen in the last it was like maybe a month. Prior to deciding to change."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, can I can I suggest the possibility. yeah okay. yeah it's it's possible I just i'm just going to ask you, do you think that perhaps there's a part of you, that is grieving for a lifestyle. That you lost through these car accidents and this chronic pain that you're grieving what you used to be able to do the way you used to be able wanted the way you want it to live your life clean your House take care of your kids exercise all that stuff."
17566.0,Patient,yeah yeah I could yeah for sure.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so, because you know depression is one of the stages of grief. Okay, and and because."
17566.0,Patient,it's kind of in your face because you know you've been struggling with it for so long.
760.0,Provider,"And, and now you're getting to the point where you want to take action, you could have triggered grief kind of feelings. Okay tossing up and and you know. We all struggle with feeling we don't have to have a clinical diagnosis of depression. To sometimes struggle with feeling depressed that makes. yeah yeah just just kind of work, think about that as you move forward. So that's. It with your mental health that's that's everything else is good, with that how about a family history anybody in your blood relatives have any mental health condition. Your knowledge."
17566.0,Patient,"yeah my both my mom and brother has pretty severe OCD. Like not not where people like say they have a city like they truly been diagnosed like they are the type that if they don't do a certain thing something bad will happen. So they have compulsions and. The all around both both problems of OCD. I definitely do not be watching them, I know I definitely do not have that thing called because they to be honest, I don't mean to be mean but they drive me insane like it's really hard for me to understand. So, like sometimes I just want to say stop what you're doing like if, as a person like looking on the outside, like this is not Okay, but yeah they are problem trying to think of anybody. my sister has she has pretty severe anxiety, but she also did have ovarian cancer at 26 years old, and I think that kind of like sprung that on because she wasn't able to have her own kids like there's a lot with."
760.0,Provider,Oh she's she's grieving things that she. The way she wanted her life to go to.
17566.0,Patient,"um yes 100% so I mean I feel like Hers is more. things that have happened to her that has concert to be that way, whereas my brother and my mom are literally like the same person they both have. anxiety and OCD, but I think it's the inciting probably comes from the OCD i'm guessing I don't because they can't control things yeah but it's pretty pretty severe other than that my dad no i'm. Just I know, everybody else is fine it's just mostly those two."
760.0,Provider,"Okay okay. All right, so how is your relationship with your. Parents and. your brother and mother and."
17566.0,Patient,"mom my sister. my sister and I are best friends, everything is good, with that um that's that's actually a whole long story, but I actually i'm her child is actually my child. So I gave her my eggs, so that she could but but it's a big family secrets, and nobody knows, but me and her and my mom dad and her and her husband's parents so."
760.0,Provider,Okay.
17566.0,Patient,"Her and I are very close, but again there's a lot of secret Sir. my brother I tend to stay away from him because you never know what you're going to get like I do I probably talked to him more than most people will talk to their siblings on adult age, but. I I do stay away probably physically from them, just because he's so up and down like I would venture to say he's bipolar I really would. I don't know if that's he hasn't been diagnosed, but both my sister, and I think he is. My mom we probably talk every day, but if i'm being honest she I noticed that all getting anxiety just talking to her. So I tried to like she puts her therapist she puts everything on me because i'm probably the most easy going in the family so she tends. To put. Everything on me and my dad's a lot like me so she basically bullies my dad and and and me and puts her problems on us. And then my dad and I. get along great too because he's super easy to get along with."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, do you want to work on that you want to learn how to put boundaries up with your. mom."
17566.0,Patient,"yeah that's the perfect word yeah actually, that would be not my husband and my sister have been telling me for years that. That I do need to have my sisters to type that will. say something directly to my like she'll stop her in her tracks and basically tell her like no you're not going to treat me that way or you're not going to do that, I have a hard time doing that, in general, with pretty much everybody even my children they pretty much walk all over me. i'm learning to get better at that, but it's hard i'm not a tech person, I can say no, I have a very hard time saying no and if I say no, I feel, like, I have to give a reason why, even if it's a lie just to get just to make me not."
760.0,Provider,be okay.
17566.0,Patient,"And I know that's a terrible thing to say, but."
760.0,Provider,No that's that's a very honest thing to say.
17566.0,Patient,yeah.
760.0,Provider,"I was like that's important. yeah that's that's i'm thankful that you're sharing that with me, because I know we're just meeting yeah yeah but no that's good so yeah that's something that we can work on. We can talk about that, in practice, yet um let's see so talk to me about where you live now who you are what city and state you live, first of all."
17566.0,Patient,"I laverne California. Okay, so. I don't know where you guys are at booth it's like southern California."
760.0,Provider,"Where we're all yeah i'm in southern California as. Well, yes, I know where laverne is. So who do you live with."
17566.0,Patient,My husband and my. Four kids.
760.0,Provider,"And what are your ages, the ages of your kids."
17566.0,Patient,"Okay, so we all just turn to say 18 1513 and 10."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, and would you how would you characterize your relationship with your husband."
17566.0,Patient,i'm surprisingly like really good at the reason I say that is because we were high school sweethearts so we've been together for.
760.0,Provider,A long time or 223 years a long time.
17566.0,Patient,"So things I feel like are the only thing you can say with that and I feel like we we don't like I don't we don't fight, very often, and I definitely don't like to fight in. front of my kids if we do, because I grew up with my parents fighting in front of me constantly so that's like a big know, for me, is he is also very. want to say the wrong word i'm trying to think of the word he's kind of. he's a strong personality so."
760.0,Provider,he's very alienated opinionated.
17566.0,Patient,"Yes, like firstborn his ways are the right ways to do things so he's another one, like, I would say, with my mom my sister my husband and my second child she's the 15 year old they all have very similar personalities, where they kind of like. I let them take over like they kind of like. Their personality so strong but it's like i'll just kind of let you do your thing and I, you know. I I take a step back."
760.0,Provider,Okay okay and and that's okay. let's see tucked me about your highest level of education.
17566.0,Patient,"I did some college and then I ended up getting pregnant, so we started a business and went a different."
760.0,Provider,route so you're a business owner.
17566.0,Patient,"yeah so I run well right now i'm running two companies, I do a little bit with I used to do with health as well, and I saw some clients, but I kind of let that run itself so really the two other businesses are that what i'm really focused on."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, is that does that cause a lot of stress is that. yeah you bet your stress over the business or maybe over parenting or. yeah hold or what have you."
17566.0,Patient,"um business wise I I love working like I could I i've always been a stay at home mom but i've always worked from home on our business so like it's kind of a. Double edged sword people like say oh you stay at home and you get to work you're lucky we'll kind of it's I think people saw through coven, but when you're working at home with children it's not easy so it's very stressful. Right now it's better, I have a secretary that helps me and my husband does a lot of the work with our main company, and then the other one. It was beginning to be very stressful and I kind of took a step backwards, like i'm doing it's built the second part is building pools. So I took a little bit of back with that i'm not taking on as many jobs because it's it's a lot there's a lot of problems, and so it just it becomes very stressful so I did I did cut down on that so that would help."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, and. talk to me about any hobbies."
17566.0,Patient,"Honestly, I don't have any I used to be the gym."
760.0,Provider,I go to the gym exercise sounds like.
17566.0,Patient,"And then, like what you're saying I think you're right because, like even when my kids were I would. I would tell them that my babies were three months old just so I could take them to the gym when they were only you know, a month old, and so I could go and work out and have that like peace of mind, like six days a week, and then I did that, for I mean it's got to be. 15 years and so to like all of a sudden, like it kind of was like a like it kind of flipped off quickly that's what was so weird it was like constant and then all of a sudden, it was like nothing so I don't know."
760.0,Provider,yeah Sir sighs.
17566.0,Patient,yeah.
760.0,Provider,"And so, then you were left. feeling, because the body starts to. feel like kind of uneasy when it doesn't get exercise when it doesn't get movement and your body's feeling uneasy anyway because you're in pain."
17566.0,Patient,"yeah and that's it become this like circle of like okay well i'm going to try it. And then i'd hurt myself and then i'd be out for a week and i'd be like what's after after doing that so many times, I was like what's the point you know, like. i'm only going to go workout just hurt myself and then, and then it was like okay why didn't try, so it kind of got to the point where like I now like, I want to. i'm a little scared to I think I know what I can and can't do but i'm kind of afraid that i'm going to go try those and it's gonna hurt me and then."
760.0,Provider,"Well, I yeah. Talk to the doctor because it's really important for anxiety. yeah. You know, it really is. yeah okay um let me see. Looking down to make sure, because you've been i'll make sure i've got my questions. talk to me about your self esteem. me."
17566.0,Patient,Go ahead and. step.
760.0,Provider,"Up esteem, maybe before the accident and maybe now to. Okay talk to me about."
17566.0,Patient,"yeah I feel like. yeah that's been that's been hard for me because, like I said, like I i'm the type that would have a baby, and I would look the same two months later, as I did before, I had the baby with all for my kids like I like. I did I looked really good I felt good, like everything was great and then. You feel like I started the Gala pension, the one that I believe me gain the weight, because it happened so quickly. After I thought on that and I started that right before coven hit and then with Kobe role in our houses and we're with our kids and we can't really go anymore, so at that point, I felt like. yeah it's definitely gotten like I don't really want to. Go places, you know because I don't feel like I look well, while I don't think I look bad compared to how I used to look like I feel bad. Okay. You know I."
760.0,Provider,See you as you value yourself based on. You know your fitness. yeah what I.
17566.0,Patient,I feel like it was such a big part of me like I mean I was a health coach for a while. So it's like. For it to be like so extreme and then for it to be the opposite now is still is very difficult for me okay yeah.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so talk to me about any traumatic experiences in your life, including abuse in childhood. Any of that."
17566.0,Patient,"i'm no abuse I just feel like if I think back to my childhood I think about my parents fighting a lot, while they're still married. He my mom's mental issues have really caused I feel like damage for. Like me, and how I raise my kids for me and like how I perceive her how I perceived marriage like I tried to do everything the opposite of what she did because, because how. Just like up and down and how little or ways of thinking, I just that would I, so I mean, I guess, it would be like well it wasn't abusive right."
760.0,Provider,abuse can also include things like verbal emotional abuse doesn't have to be hitting. yeah I think.
17566.0,Patient,"I wouldn't say that she emotionally abused me she she maybe now I don't know I think she does she tends to like pick on me. And she's a very big the best I can say she's a bully to me not to anybody else but me and my dad we but it's our my done are very similar personality so. I think that's why she she knows who she can pick on that's why, when you said boundaries, I was like yes, I need help with that because she has known. at all as far as an employee think of anything else. Most well."
760.0,Provider,Another black. To he said she had mental health.
17566.0,Patient,Issues yeah.
760.0,Provider,shana as well.
17566.0,Patient,"My we were really lucky my dad he liked how my family is we own the same kind of business my dad was a stay at home dad as well, so my husband is. What we're he was always around so like my kids same with us like we're with our kids 24 seven so I had my dad there, thank God, to. I feel like I had him, even if I didn't have her necessarily all the time, not that she was about mom but I did have both of them they're physically. However, each when i'm trying to think because they were also highschool sweethearts. And yeah. I think i'm trying to think of something traumatic and we weren't kids, but when we were held us like I was 20 like 27. And I had three kids about point we did find out that my dad had an affair, on her with a secretary of ours, which we all knew. So I think if anything would be traumatic in my life would probably be that probably cost a lot of problems and they hit it so like they didn't want us to like talk about it. And yes, we never got help for it, we never like even though we're you know we're adults, we still did not take it well at all."
760.0,Provider,But it was I bet it was obvious that it was going on it's not like. yeah yeah.
17566.0,Patient,yeah.
760.0,Provider,"All right, so you said that your your mother used to kind of pick on your father, when you were a."
17566.0,Patient,Child and they will get like frequently.
760.0,Provider,"Do you think when we're at what age were you when you think she started picking on you, because because. you're so similar to your father."
17566.0,Patient,"Trying to think back young and honestly I couldn't think of like. I can only really think about to back to like adults like. But even young adults who like. She was very controlling like we couldn't go certain places back to our city because bad things could happen. People though on the field trips we can't go on the field trips unless she's right there. Then, when I started having kids it was an unhealthy relationship where she would be like constantly involved. Like I would see her every day, whether I wanted to or not making comments on how I should raise my children and like it's funny because I see her with my sister and she's not at all like that, with her. it's just me like just because I didn't tell her no I didn't stop her from doing that so she she just did so, I mean and I had my first kid at 21 so basically. If she's been doing it for a while, I would say, like kind of control."
760.0,Provider,"it's a control so maybe like maybe in the young adulthood, or maybe the late. teenage years or."
17566.0,Patient,"yeah I think you know what like late. teenagers, because my husband, I did meet when we were 15 and. She liked to control kind of like that relationship as well, so yeah you know what it was probably two teenagers okay okay good okay that's."
760.0,Provider,"that's helpful okay um talk to me about your health habits, we talked about exercise already and I know that's not going to be a problem, as long as you can. yeah I can bet your diet and. You don't sleep yeah I."

A bladder issue, which is your right, like he wants me to go fix both of those because I have to go the bathroom like 10 times a night so My guess would be, it is probably one of those two things like the snoring wakes me up and then I go to the bathroom."
760.0,Provider,"I thought it. Sometimes, it was a medicine medicine it's not it doesn't have to be a medicine."

760.0,Provider,"And in even if you find out, even if you just there's some procedure that the doctor is recommending. To have the information. To find out what. The thing is, and then you can start making plans to how to address the problem it doesn't have to be sometimes it's good just to get the information. yeah maybe it has nothing to do with any kind of an invasive. procedure at all I don't know, but if you don't talk to the doctor you're not going to know."
17566.0,Patient,"yeah that's true, I know I feel like I had a hysterectomy a couple years ago and before that I have multiple issues with that, so it was like. I kept telling myself okay i'm gonna do the hysterectomy this year, then i'll deal with this, you know and then like for me, the biggest thing okay now I got off the medicine so okay now it's like I don't want to be. bothered for another year, you know, like there's always something wrong, I felt like."

Then it was okay well i'm starting this detox so i'll start eating better I mean everybody says this I I i'm acting like one of my clients, I know this, but. I don't be like okay i'm gonna when I feel better from detoxing i'll do that and it's like now oh i'm detoxing so I don't feel great so i'm just going to eat, what I want. I already know i'm doing bad things I do, I can be honest with that, but it's hard to get out of that that you know that mindset like that, because I haven't felt good and so long that I immediately go back to that."

All of that is just it's it's a lot to try to you know, to take away from myself and try to do something for myself it's a lot."
760.0,Provider,yeah and well you're already doing a lot of things for yourself.
17566.0,Patient,yeah.
760.0,Provider,"yeah that's right now is for yourself and. You know. and taking care of these these health conditions, and you know. Planning your exercise. Yes, part of it, and maybe it maybe once you start a routine of some sort of exercise it'll be easier for the diet to come next."
17566.0,Patient,"yeah I hope so, I think that that's kind of what i'm like waiting for like I want so badly for that to click. For me it's kind of like all or nothing which is terrible terrible mentality to have but like if i'm if i'm exercising I want to eat good, but if i'm not what's the point well there is a point but for me mentally right now I feel like it's not because i'm not connecting the two."

760.0,Provider,But this one area only.
17566.0,Patient,yeah.
760.0,Provider,"yeah okay okay. All right, well, I would. Maybe to help Have you ever tried like meditation or relaxation to deal with both either the anxiety and also the insomnia, have you tried those halfway."
17566.0,Patient,"um I haven't I do, I listened to, like waves and and rain at night for sleep, which clearly it's not working for me if I place. I need to be better at that I think that, because. Because my kids were young and I never had time for myself and then, when I finally did the covert hit, and then I they're always around and i'm always helping them. I didn't have time now, I have, I have more time, so I do need to just force myself to like instead of cleaning or doing that instead it's hard for me when i'm sitting and trying to relax if something's not. That is another thing I was cleaning nine a lot like with my. working out and eating like it's all or nothing so. And usually it's all like, I have to have it clean or i'm. Just like I can't relax until my house is clean, so I just need to get better at like saying okay that's not important my my my health is more important at this moment it's just hard to pull away from that."

17566.0,Patient,"know no I mean not really I mean I think it's i'm i'm glad it's not I felt like when she told me, I had to see a therapist like Am I don't say, had I just I haven't. In the past I haven't really maybe like once or twice and the particular therapist I was with he told me all of his problems I kid you not like, he told me, it was the funniest thing like you told me about all this marriage problems. And we didn't talk about me. I feel like he to me I don't have any like in this normal circumstance I don't have those drug issues where like I feel like the normal person and the situation would so I didn't really know what you know what would be about."
760.0,Provider,"therapy therapy is about the total person and. This these questions are kind of designed to pull out from you. Okay what's going on and. I, I would like to to work with you, with your boundaries. We. That and then mindfulness because. That practicing that you know, would help you, I think, with your anxiety. that's like that's proven to help people with anxiety and."

So that that works out perfect that we're able to talk about other things, so I think that's good."
760.0,Provider,yeah because you know treatment is the whole person. it's not just you know it's just not it's not just a problem that you've been taking these prescription opiates that's not. US it's all of you. yeah it's the pain it's the health it's. yeah the family issues.
