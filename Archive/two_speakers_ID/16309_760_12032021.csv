760.0,Provider,Lewis. How are you.
16309.0,Patient,Are you.
760.0,Provider,"doing good have you been the last couple talk to me about the last couple weeks how's your Depression and anxiety, what do you been how's that been going. Over today."
16309.0,Patient,"yeah good good I am so my dad was was here visiting for the holidays was fun we actually went to Catalina island and yeah had a good time with the family. awesome stuff. yeah I mean yeah I feel like I. I do find myself kind of like getting the right, I feel like i'm. I don't know Finally, is the right word but i'm kind of getting a handle on this whole situation that. has had me like overthinking so much. And just. Like recognizing the thought patterns. That lead to that you know and."
760.0,Provider,"Then, what would it what would you talk to me a little bit about those thought patterns you're. you're referring to."
16309.0,Patient,"um so yeah. I guess certain other so there's so many to come. Like, for example. Okay, so we're talking like last time we were talking about you know my I guess that this decision that I hadn't had to make. In terms of like what what whether I should I should actually go for this job. or like stick to music, you know. Like like for from from you know from from just from that those two. A lot of is that, like I guess parents arise because I have so many like different branches that come to mind like for. With within. Like with. So let's see. I was actually just journaling which was good, too. Okay, I could just like read off some of this actually to you know."
760.0,Provider,sure if that helps you. yeah I guess that's good.
16309.0,Patient,"yeah so um. Okay, so Melissa is going to be scatterbrained but so bear with me. Okay, so. All right. yeah okay so so. So yeah i've had two massive pressure points yeah building building up in the past five months and I haven't had enough closer I guess. button, by which I mean seeing musical projects to completion and and having some something to show, so I think i'd be more eager to direct my focus towards getting a data analyst job for a steady paycheck again."
760.0,Provider,If I had wanted.
16309.0,Patient,"One or one or two projects completed. Because it would allow me to set a. precedent right like one that says that i'm not done here and and I will never ever be, because this is a passion and I have. That, I want to get better at, but a quality projects like the it requires time and. that's time that I have right now, and probably won't have when i'm working full time again. And yes, but he started to pile on once again. One of the problems that's the killing these is that the market is so hot right now. For like 30 jobs."
760.0,Provider,yeah the job market yeah.
16309.0,Patient,"yeah so like like. It would it wouldn't be like like I think I mean. Like I don't know if it's if it be easier now within like in seven months or six months or a year. But the market seems to be like showing you that it is going to be easier if I just kind of pull my full focused towards that, and the fact that you know, the gap is growing and there isn't it but i'm."
760.0,Provider,"going to have on your resume that you're working on, you have your own company is it your own company or."
16309.0,Patient,"I guess I could say like i'm like an like an entrepreneur, I guess, like in. Because I yeah I mean I."
760.0,Provider,"yeah you would want to you would always want to put that on a resume. yeah then now, even if you've decided today I want to go. apply for jobs, he would still want to put that on your. resume now. And you wouldn't want that gap, you would want to explain that."
16309.0,Patient,"For sure, and I did, and that actually got me a really good interview. Back in like October that I failed because I wasn't like I was like in between, I think we talked about this last time, but I was like in between two the two things and I just feel like work whenever i'm not like fully focused on something, but I just seem to kind of half acid. And i'm not I don't like that. And so that's that's it that's one more one more thing that kind of cause some anxiety. There you feel like if you start working full time in this other job."
760.0,Provider,or any other job than you feel that you're going to be half asking your your dream your goals to. Make your way you know that's your concern yeah.
16309.0,Patient,"tech jobs require like constant learning and and like I mean that's why this year, like like like."
760.0,Provider,That make sense.
16309.0,Patient,"Many people who were like hey like it's their life, you know, and while I do see things like moving. or like improving in in the in the whole like Labor force. understanding of like burnout and people like Mike wanted to move towards like a four day workweek and stuff like that, but, but I feel like still like there's still so much pressure to be like. Like on top of things and tech and stuff and that like takes away time from like sitting still and focusing on on on music and not allow and creativity to come in. Instead of just like trying to force."
760.0,Provider,Something.
16309.0,Patient,"Another thing that like I feel like I like I. I trick myself into into believing that that Oh, if you just have all the time in the world to just invite these creative thoughts you'll have. Instead of just like getting to work and having the like inspiration come from doing the work and and that I ended I don't have because I haven't had because I haven't. built, I guess, like the discipline with. I guess myself in this period of time I have had in the past, but that was also because ahead external accountability during my master's program and I was like Okay, I can like. i'm like i'm like Okay, I have a deadline i'm gonna be like really stressed a lot of different this flight right now."
760.0,Provider,And I.
16309.0,Patient,"I did have those like ADHD like stress response. type. projects, you know that only got done at the last minute, because it was do or die so. I feel like I got into a decent head space with directing my focus whenever. Whenever I was living in nashville and it had like. i'm going to say good work life balance, because. I. I had a decent like mentor and but even but but still look for my liking 50 hours a week is a bit more than I mean sometimes it was 60 hours a week. was more yeah more than what you know and like because i'm like i'm just slower at some stuff with the I mean, I guess, I can blame the wall that he causes. that's one thing was just so frustrating that even I events can't resolve, just like getting to director focus on something, whether you like it or not. But anyways I had reached like what I deem to be the pinnacle so far of my ability to direct my focus and accomplish things. Because they were like let's see if it seemed like I was like you know, in that, like most ensure. Adult hood like type yeah i'm do this and not worry about that shape because it's a good time for it Okay, and not let that come into my brain like, but now, with all the time. it's like it like i'm eating myself alive with with those thoughts, you know and that's not good obviously so. yeah a lot of it like with. With comes down to yeah like again we try to like. To talk about that."
760.0,Provider,"yeah let's let's let's slow down a little bit and let's take a deep breath one thing to do when your brain gets. So overwhelmed with all these thoughts is you know do your deep breathing. sure some deep breathing and let's. Talk about this let's let's break it down and the question I had, for me, for you is, from what I remember for our session last time you seemed like you were starting to get pretty stressed out over the lack of income or perhaps it was the deleting of your savings. yeah um so that stress might be impacting your mental health. yeah is that is that i'm a fairly."
16309.0,Patient,"reasonable to say for sure, even though I do have like a decent enough support system like like when my dad you know actually he he's doing better than ever before, like during college. You they were able to help and like not like you know. I I went through college. And all that but, but in but now, he was like yeah man, I mean if if you if you know you were run out i've got i've got you. For three months and look no worries on that. And that that helped a like that, and again that's. I feel like i've already fallen into a like. complacent may not be the right word, but like. Under stimulated. way of going about my day which does not lead to the outcome that I want."
760.0,Provider,"Perhaps you feel that your your your daily routine as of this moment is not structured enough or maybe you feel it's not structured at all wanna what it is, is it a structure or is that a REP is that are."
16309.0,Patient,"Like I I. mystery like like I tried structuring it. Like so much like or like. Like like like overly engineer over like being overly analytical about things, but whenever I got to La for like three months, four months. Maybe even five yeah from like from like from last from last. September, October up to. Up to my trip to nashville which, like was like in April, I was like I was, I was, I still seem to have the the the the momentum. That I had. From that period of that was telling you about. yeah sure, and you know because I had it like deadlines and shit so. And I kind of. it's weird like I like I felt like I was just. Part of the reason why. This is a bit of a tangent but but but very related part of the reason why I felt like that was possible. To get into into that more I guess you know directed directed a mindset was because I felt with my body, I felt like whenever you mentioned presence last last meeting rather what it is being. Being in the present moment mindfulness. I felt like I was one with my body and brain like at all times like like it helped to seem like in control and. After magic mushrooms and astral I was like to have your. you'd like you seem like a bit too wired you know, maybe, if you if if if you stop like overanalyzing you schedule and and direct your focused. With your impetus like like doing what I want to do at the moment, as long as it works for works for me, for whatever I want to do that it kind of seems like the ideal way to live my life, but then again. I I sometimes can't rely on on on on myself as as as hard as it is to hear that."
760.0,Provider,"Well, you sometimes. You your chosen profession your chosen dream job or or or business, I should say, is very creative and so you, you know creative isn't something that's like an on demand kind of thing. You know, is it comes, sometimes it comes in waves right. This is that fair."
16309.0,Patient,"yeah for sure and i've done so much research regarding this and and honestly it like a good balance and mixture of that lifestyle seems to be. like having a schedule to where you took like he just do the work, whether you would like it or not, because oftentimes I mean it's the same reason, they say inspiration is for amateurs because, like you know professional artists. oftentimes just you know use like this and look like the act of working brings in the thoughts brings in."
760.0,Provider,invites the creative taking action that make.
16309.0,Patient,"sense yeah but if that if those might not be like as a strong balance of creativity as like the ones you get from the con coming back to this trip or whatever like. i'm like stimulated by something I saw and just i'm mine's going haywire and like. I can just dump it, you know but uh so like that that's like that dichotomy is kind of one that I have to balance but it's been hard to because i've also like. If I were living in nashville I would have I think i'd have more chance of that because I had a whole network of people that have like talk to and."
760.0,Provider,The thing you had you had a base.
16309.0,Patient,"You had a support yeah in La I I never I never been as lonely, as I have been here and."
760.0,Provider,You came here when again.
16309.0,Patient,When did you leave Mexico and.
760.0,Provider,Come to La again was that before Kobe right and.
16309.0,Patient,"That was doing covert it was actually because, again, I have been laid off from a job. Like there's a lot of creative opportunities that are more my style than what I see in nashville based on music wise in La and my brothers there so i'll live with them, you know better than living alone in a shoe box during the height of the pandemic. And that did help, but it was it was great for the first few months. But now it's like. You know I I feel like I need stimulation that's what that's another thing that I wanted those in my mind, because, like, I feel like it's hard. And this relates to that mindset to that that that steady like directing the focus on mindset, I feel like. it's either under stimulated or overnight. Instead of like a nice medium."
760.0,Provider,So finding balance. You know it's true in all parts of our life finding balance is very important.
16309.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
760.0,Provider,What about this thought. Like you say that you're feeling nervous I don't know about funds running out it's great that you have this resource that your father's offered you for at least a couple of months. I don't know how you would feel about. Taking him up on that offer if you should have to do that. I don't know if that would have that would you affect you emotionally or.
16309.0,Patient,"He he actually he he has been and in the past year, a couple times. Which yeah again, I think that, like. Whether it's indirect or not somehow feeds the complacency beast or. Whatever they call it. Just like oh i'm i'm a kid again, you know, and I don't even need to be like responsible. And, and even though."
760.0,Provider,"So that impacts, the way you think about yourself that you're relying on. Time that."
16309.0,Patient,Like. Can it's like.
760.0,Provider,Is that no.
16309.0,Patient,"yeah I feel like I need to meditate more often, because I too. it's so weird that like I I internalized things that at many points in my life i've just like managed to be totally okay with letting them go and like just the the. yeah like the ideal. lifestyle of like them being present and mindfulness and but. I feel like it comes with with this like solitude. The they're going to come up more often, so I just have to kind of built up like I guess like more tools to avoid them from from like getting the attention that they don't deserve yeah."
760.0,Provider,yeah so you would see said they come up more often than negative thoughts what What do you mean when you use the word pay.
16309.0,Patient,me for me. ruminating. on things. Instead of being decisive. Because. I guess like there's this speech for perfectionism perfectionism that translates to.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, there we go. There we go. yeah so analysis paralysis kind of things. Sure, the timing everything okay i'm going to get all this figured out and then i'm going to execute. Instead of just letting the process unwind and adjusting as you catch mistakes or things that need to be done more efficiently, or better somehow and correcting them as you go. kind of. Things and so you're kind of wired to. analyze everything and then act."
16309.0,Patient,"Right yeah. yeah that's for sure, one thing that yeah i've. i've. been been trying to battle, but it's just kind of keeps coming."
760.0,Provider,"Okay well how, how can we work with that, how can we that's some really good insight Louis So how can we use that now. i'm like you say you say that you might want to go take this position or interview for this position or take another job you know just because you take a job today or tomorrow, maybe you could do it for a period of time, like a year or two years. And then. and save your money. i'm just these are just suggestions for sure."
16309.0,Patient,"Oh you're a young man what more than welcome. it's like I guess that comes to mind, but I guess the whole block or is that. Like I feel like like if I do that without. Again, having something to show. To my future self that seeds, with a job that sees Oh well, you would keep or you're capable of this and this when I had when I now have a time to focus on making something. That I wouldn't be able to make without the time offered to me with a full time job will would offer me like an insight that I can pull from what when when I am at the job. And i'm usually like I have things in the back of my mind that don't allow for like more creative insight or you know. Because. they're they're oftentimes when i'm like you know in in in the in the weeds of like worker or something and I feel like. I feel more adult you know and and that kind of. Like it would help to have like some sort of anchor that I could see and prove to myself, because I have, I have improved so much in terms of like what I know about. Like music production in his past year and a half and kanno theory like like like my standards have gone up, which is great. But also bath I guess um but. yeah, this is the time to do it is, I guess, my final point, with what you suggested, because i'm 30 i'm 31 I have the energy to do this right now. And the more the more I delay it the I think the the, the harder it will be to accept the fact that i'm I might not have like this one great project. It seems to be like a bucket list for me an important one, and I have, I have, I told myself that I will not get depressed if I if I, and I will be easy not not too harsh on myself if this doesn't happen, but that doesn't mean that I can't put fucking everything that I have into it like."
760.0,Provider,"Every So if you pursue this. yeah and it doesn't end you pursue it with all your heart all your soul your mind all your everything. And it doesn't go the way you want it. yeah so you're saying to me that you would be okay with that you would be okay at that point, taking a deep breath and taking a different job."
16309.0,Patient,The.
760.0,Provider,Is that is that what you're saying.
16309.0,Patient,"The reason why I was able to do my master's degree was because that same thing at 26 I was like you know, and maybe you're not you're maybe going to compose dude it's okay like. it's fine. I know a lot more about music making than I did then. Like. it's just a thought. or two so at 26 I was like. I forgave myself for that I was like this is this, this is going to be good to have some financial security that will allow you to keep this as a as a hobby if anything else. And it's okay it's Okay, so I told myself the same thing whenever I took a trip to nashville to from natural to here. Telling myself like like what I just said i'm not going to be too hard on herself but doesn't mean that I can't I can't give them, given my all and the fact that, like. Like like I. I want to stop like blaming. ADHD for like not doing these things you know and like hitting these walls that don't just don't like Allow me. To to to move forward in the way that I want to end right my focus and attention. When I when I need to and. Also, a different thought in my head right now that I think is important to be better. about my brother, but. yeah that it's just. That again like it doesn't mean that I can't. put a lot of effort into it now, and at least have like. An a three song EP that i'm proud of a three song EP and i'm proud of it, I can I know I can do it. piece like like bye. bye like April or May of next year, if I if I discipline myself and I and i'm not a perfectionist and I allow myself."
760.0,Provider,"But how, how does it look to let go of the need or the the the thought habit i'll just put it like that. Being perfectionist and being. focused like you say how does how's that."
16309.0,Patient,"The thing about an attraction isn't thing is it's also a good thing, because it ups my standards and I turned my whole life i've. built this like music taste, that I self proclaimed as a great. And that."
760.0,Provider,"That you have pride, you have pride you're proud of it."
16309.0,Patient,"Yes, and the fact that I like I. I know what's good and bad. helps helps me gauge like if i'm on the right track or not, and I guess I could do that as like perfection, but then that, then I can also be self aware enough to say okay you're not going to be able to sound like that you can do as best as you can. But like having that as a benchmark having these songs as a benchmark and reference points are like. Like part of part of the good side of that perfectionism I guess."
760.0,Provider,"Okay well let's let's stop there if can can can I suggest a possible alternative way of looking at perfectionism. perfectionism is a desire to have all my situation everything, who I am. Everything that I do everything I be be in a certain way and it puts somebody in a place where they're constantly needing to control all these factors. troll most. Many and most of those things we don't have control over. We only have them, I mean we don't have control over much of things that. In our lives, some things, yes, many things know so perfectionism is needing everything to be a certain way, everything to be quote unquote perfect an alternative way to think about the positive side of perfectionism is instead of using the word perfectionism use the word excellence. Excellence excellence. Because excellence allows for an individual to. stumble excellent elect excellence allows for a person to learn excellence allows for. something to be a work in progress and and to not necessarily start out perfect but you're working towards it."
16309.0,Patient,mm hmm.
760.0,Provider,"Because perfectionism when people get stuck and they start ruminating in that it can cause anxiety and depression, because you're trying to control all these things that you cannot control."
16309.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
760.0,Provider,"And once we start doing that we we we give away all of our power to instead look inside of the self and say to myself, you know I can't control. This financial situation going on right here, but let me look at me and see what are some of the things. that are going on in my life and the way i'm thinking in the way i'm handling emotions or coping with emotions in my behaviors my attitudes my beliefs, so that I can maybe look at those things and make changes that are going to be helpful to me. Does that makes some kind of sense to you so redefining instead of calling it positive excellent are. perfectionism just use the word."
16309.0,Patient,"Yes, and as I said, the next year, my my brain doesn't doesn't doesn't just switch."
760.0,Provider,"yeah okay. You know what sometimes sometimes we have to, we have to repeat because we get you know we we start to develop these certain habits in the way that we think the certain things that we believe and we just we think about them, or even sometimes to the point of rumination. Over and over and it just gets ingrained and in our thinking and in our brains. And, and sometimes we get so entrenched in that stuff we miss all this other things going on over here. You know because I, my son showed me this video because you know the human mind can really only think about a couple of things at once, mostly. You know. You know it's it's not really designed to think about 20 things at once. So they have this video of these. Players taking basketball shots and they're the narrator asks you to count how many how many shots does each of these different players it's like four different players."
16309.0,Patient,That comes in.
760.0,Provider,"there's a. yeah there's there's how many shots to play this player to get how many shots display or forget, and they want you to count that and keep track of that. You watch this video of these. People taking shots. But when the narrator comes back after this experience he asks you how many of you saw the gorilla."
16309.0,Patient,Right yeah they really.
760.0,Provider,"Are you saying that. yeah. And and and the gorilla goes running across the and most people don't see the gorilla because they're so busy they're so focused on the shots but they missed the gorilla. And the human mind is like that, so when we're so ruminated and like repeating over and over again, and especially to the point of perfectionist that can become. destructive because it paralyzes us it's, how do you execute something if you're expecting perfection, from the time you from the moment you start something it's like you know we're human beings, where we make mistakes and and, frankly, we learn from our mistakes."
16309.0,Patient,"This is so so you're saying i'm good because of the way i'm interpreting, that is, that Oh, I give them an eye over analyze things yeah up to perfectionism it's like I, I find myself like needing to like step take a take a step back constantly so I don't miss the gorilla. Sending sense. I can see all the avenues to this. One yeah."
760.0,Provider,"And sometimes it's sometimes just in my i'm just gonna. I mean i'm not going to go into detail with you, or anything Louis, but in my own personal life, especially when I was younger. You know I I thought I wanted a certain thing that I didn't want. I mean. It turned out, I didn't want that thing. yeah and as my life pursued, I found happiness in ways that I truly did not expect. yeah and so using concepts such as mindfulness and taking a step back to needing to have a certain thing, especially when that thing is out of my control, you know that stresses you out that makes you feel maybe affects your self esteem your emotional health mental health. You know you're 31 you're still super young and in my book. And I know I know you've achieved a lot, you know what your talents are and that's that's excellent to take a step back and and just be open to the concept that you know, maybe this is the path for me, maybe it's not and just be kind of open minded with it."
16309.0,Patient,"yeah but that's the problem. Because that's been what i've been doing for the past like that, like. Ah, and and and it's like okay make make the decision you know, like that that's. And and yeah like be like be like before, when I was being decisive it was it was more effective, even though I wasn't maybe like as as comfortable with the outcome. But they were outcomes and they were not outcomes."
760.0,Provider,"But see that but that's good it's good if you if you create something, and you don't like the outcome. You know that's an opportunity to examine the experience examine the outcome, think about it, about it a little bit more and decide Okay, where, could I you know, and perhaps go back to the drawing board with all this experience and and fix it. You know, instead of the see that's the difficulty with the perfectionist attitude, because the perfectionist just wants to check it all because it's not perfect and then it's this constant never ending battle to. You know, pick up this project and have it be perfect, as from the moment i'm creating it through the entire process. And that's that's very. You know. we're human we were going to make mistakes and and frankly Louis we learn from our mistakes."
16309.0,Patient,yeah definitely yeah for sure.
760.0,Provider,"So so taking you know we talked we talked about mindfulness. You know, doing some breathing being in the present moment, perhaps. You know, accepting where we're at right now, like you know how do you practice mindfulness what, what do you, what do you think what do you know about mindfulness what is some of the key principles of mindfulness as far as you understand."
16309.0,Patient,"As far as I understand. This is, this is not, this is not meditate meditation we sent you thank."
760.0,Provider,You you can meditate and be mindful.
16309.0,Patient,Okay yeah.
760.0,Provider,that's you can be mindful without meditation.
16309.0,Patient,yeah to me be I guess being mindful. I guess like what. I do use a car told us like I could build her like what like the power of now I.
760.0,Provider,Have a. present moment.
16309.0,Patient,You are you are not your thoughts this let them lead it's like a conveyor belt of thoughts and you don't have to pitch every single one.
760.0,Provider,Just let them go watch them and and and so that also implies letting go of a judgment about oneself or about a situation or whatever.
16309.0,Patient,um yeah yeah.
760.0,Provider,"And if you notice you're feeling anxious, or you notice you're feeling whatever it is you're even if it's a positive. or pleasant emotion, I noticed i'm feeling blissful today. Even even to say oh it's good that i'm blissful that's a judgment. Because."
16309.0,Patient,How do you resolve things.
760.0,Provider,"How do you resolve things. This is a practice for your mental health, how do you resolve things um. I think there's there's something in the process of letting go. That allows more of a freedom, it allows you to see things that otherwise you might not see because you're so focused on what it is you want that you're missing all these other things like that was why I told you that little story about the gorilla. And that could that could be something a different career but or maybe that could be a different way of pursuing a project in your dream business I don't know, but when we get so stuck in that we missed it. yeah literally right in front of us."
16309.0,Patient,mm hmm.
760.0,Provider,"You know, letting go of the judgment about that is it's important so i'm being aware, being aware of ones have emotions state oh if i'm feeling anxious, I notice i'm a i'm anxious right now. yeah they were if i'm feeling happy or. Or you know you said you had a great time with your family, so you say I noticed, I had a pleasant experience or I had a a good happy day with my family. I felt happy when I was with my whatever the emotion may be. And let go of the judgment you stay in the moment and you're not worried about mistakes from the past and you're not stressing about what's coming in the future."
16309.0,Patient,"that's definitely a place that I feel like that's. yeah that's how I felt whenever I was able to direct my attention a lot more often and in a better, more disciplined manner."
760.0,Provider,"But perhaps there's just so much self pressure on you, that it's hard to focus, because you feel so anxious about it because. it's very obvious Louis that you're very passionate it's very important to you, you, you want to at least you want to succeed, but if it even if you don't succeed, you want to at least know that you did your best. And the very minimum that's what I hear so when you when you're in when you're coming with a perfectionist stick attitude about it that's so much pressure that your brain is going to be in this fear state. Otherwise i'm going to lose i'm going to lose and that's always going i'm going to miss this i'm going to miss this opportunity and it's constant ruminating constant worry, this is what i'm talking about. yeah so mindfulness is a is a practice it's not something that you're going to learn in an afternoon. You know it, you know it's something that you're going to. Practice they daily yeah and then, when I catch myself that i'm not being in the present moment which truthfully we don't live in the present moment human beings were always either the past or the future. Most of us. Almost all of us, unless we're some advanced. spiritual person of some sort even even then I don't know um we struggle with being in the present moment so it's a it's a lifestyle it's a process it's it's a choice and I try to catch it every moment I can. yeah and then I don't but I don't beat myself up."
16309.0,Patient,When I noticed that I. forgot right.
760.0,Provider,That brings judgment.
16309.0,Patient,"Right. So anytime I mean because I I. Like oddly enough, I mean and i'm sure that their response to the city well that's not sustainable, but I it's been somewhat sometimes effective to just say. stop being like you know, a kid let's do it just do it, and then like i'll go like be harder on myself and older so yeah you're right and just don't think about it just do it, and then."
760.0,Provider,"Catch yourself, when you find yourself thinking don't be a kid. You correct that you know, a way to be mindful, is to stop look around notice your environment take a deep breath and say oh I seem to be being hard on myself."
16309.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
760.0,Provider,"and slow down I don't have to do that. take a deep breath, maybe, maybe take a minute to meditate you can there's mindfulness walking there's. You know, you can scan your body, because people will hold our emotions in different areas of our body if we're holding on to something you know pay attention to that and notice that it's in your shoulders, you know you can kind of shake it out and move it out yeah so um you know judgments. judgment is is kind of a harsh thing you know it's something you know I think there's a part to human nature, because we always want to protect ourselves and we're always looking for you know looking for our welfare and make sure we're going to be okay and. Right now, and so it's kind of wired into us. But at the same time, I think it's. it's it's really helpful and really healthy to the spiritual side of the human being, that we learn how to practice this non judgmental attitude, starting with oneself. And going to others. Sure, and situations and everything because because that's what creates all those stress hormones and all that anxiety and all that mess. yeah and and how you function, how do you create this thing you want to create when you have all that mess. yeah those the hormone cortisone flowing through your brain I didn't do that."
16309.0,Patient,"When it's really interesting because, like, I feel like. Like. yeah I wouldn't wouldn't like. It my my ADHD like I came back with a vengeance. Because I I like stopped being a bit more slick mindful and at the same time, discipline without like caring about the outcome just just going just doing triggered out as we go. Like it because I was trying to get into that that like node of. Of like directing myself the. Like creative impulses that work but i'm i'm proud process Okay, it is yeah."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so stop stop right there, this is a perfect opportunity. yeah when you this is the proper use of judgment when your emotions start to feel negative slow down take a deep breath and think about what's going on."
16309.0,Patient,Sure yeah.
760.0,Provider,"make sense. yeah so because that's kind of seems to be kind of wired in you, based on this conversation, and so this is like I said, this is a practice and we're going to practice. and work on that. And then, and then, as we learn how to be in the present moment. We start to heal ourselves and and as we start to heal ourselves, I think we start to find the purpose in our lives and we start to live that purpose and then that purpose, makes us happy and joyful but if i'm always in my head always being hard on me i'm going to miss that."
16309.0,Patient,"yeah yeah this yeah sure it's tough because. it's it's tough to balance that with the under simulation. Given maybe attentive form of it is it too, but. yeah but definitely doable I."
760.0,Provider,Remember it's a practice.
16309.0,Patient,Right and to not just myself.
760.0,Provider,"Yes, you. Have perfectionist inside of us. that's why I brought that up the perfectionist excited you wants it now, so if i'm going to start practicing mindfulness and I got to be perfect with that, so you just recognize oh I seem to be here, I am i'm being hard on myself again or. i'm, this is a practice I forgot so i'm going to remember right now in this moment i'm going to remember remember right now to be mindful."
16309.0,Patient,yeah yeah. that's definitely.
760.0,Provider,slows down and see what happens from there.
16309.0,Patient,"yeah but in order to get stuff done, I often find that I do need to. stimulate my mind, and like like like activate. A like a level of saugus."
760.0,Provider,"Then utilize an affirmation with your mindfulness find an affirmation or make one up. I am focused I am free i'm creative I just made one up I don't. Sure, or you can just Google, sometimes I like to Google them. So if you need some stimulation get some post, it notes and but there's my affirmation, and so, when I noticed i'm going to practice mindfulness in the moment take a breath. tell myself oh you're hard on yourself and then i'm going to think this affirmation, maybe, maybe set I don't know four or five six even seven or more times I don't know."
16309.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
760.0,Provider,"yeah and if you're gonna if you're going to schedule your day if i'm going to write my schedule, because I want to be, I want to be efficient. I have goals, then i'm going to be mindful and going to be in the moment I you know i'm waking up today and I, I noticed that I feel very motivated. To these goals, so you be mindful and you can you can get a piece of paper or you can get a tablet and type up these goals and you're going to be in the moment of making the list. And in because you're not going to be thinking ahead of task you're going mindfulness is being in the moment and if I want to make a list. Then i'm going to be mindful in that moment that i'm making the list and be fully aware, to the best of my ability, because it's a practice of this list, and then i'm going to pick an item on that list and be mindful when I as much as to the best of my ability as I execute those tasks."
16309.0,Patient,"So even even even though. At least with myself without external external accountability. I haven't. seen the be able to stick to like a very highly like. Like aid this a disciplined schedule. For more than like two months me like like like 45 days. Because I find myself like being like oh you. you're missing out on on on this way of living, because you're not like like allowing chaos into your life and therefore you're not like being you know your true authentic like creative self or whatever bs and and. And so, so. I guess it. If that's a lifelong process that I may never get over a hump that I may never like I may never find like i've tried bullet journaling i've tried, like everything. yeah it hasn't been one. That I have stuck to this, I stuck to for for more than like again a month and a half."
760.0,Provider,month and a half is is 45 days of success list.
16309.0,Patient,yeah true.
760.0,Provider,"And it becomes the failure when on the on the 46th day if it is 46 day that you don't do it. Now judge yourself that i'm a failure. Because I missed today completely denying that there was 46 days that I was success. yeah because our life is. Our life is a process. yeah we live every moment and and when we decide that it doesn't work, and then we check it all, because this is the perfection, this is the danger of."
16309.0,Patient,perfectionism sometimes.
760.0,Provider,Driving 46 days of.
16309.0,Patient,"Success but but that's actually like that's a that's rare, like most time it's like i'll do this for like five days."
760.0,Provider,"Five days to success. it's still five days of success, and if you so when we practice mindfulness if, on the Sixth day I don't do it, then I take a deep breath and I acknowledged my feelings about it, I feel you know I feel disappointed I feel. named name, whatever it is you're feeling good or bad pleasant or unpleasant name the feeling, take a deep breath pick it up and try again."
16309.0,Patient,huh yeah. yeah.
760.0,Provider,That doesn't mean that you can't do it.
16309.0,Patient,try again instead of.
760.0,Provider,"Instead of just checking the whole system. yeah this is, this is what we're talking about perfectionism. excellence."
16309.0,Patient,And even if I took this system to insert a new one.
760.0,Provider,You just slipped up for a day you're not checking it it's just oh I messed up this day and. On the seventh day i'm back on.
16309.0,Patient,"yeah. it's it seems that they don't know none of them stick, though. Even though I have like practice that like I I have, I have practiced the ability to say I forgive myself for not for not doing this, even with with journaling like I I have. July. August and then I started again in November. to back up. And I didn't judge myself for those months that I lost. But I guess like relating that to you know, a calendar, or whatever, where i'm where i'm going to try and define like the most effective thing. So where I can get the most. Like a satisfactory output, you know yeah. yeah. yeah it's just it's it's. it's continual termination."
760.0,Provider,"it's the it's the process, but the LIFE is like that."
16309.0,Patient,yeah sure.
760.0,Provider,gonna wake up and have good days. yeah we're gonna have bad days and so mindfulness is a process of practicing that.
16309.0,Patient,yeah.
760.0,Provider,"And, and we make the decision moment by moment decisions don't you know fall from the sky there there's it's because of what we're thinking what we're feeling what we believe. It leads us to our behavior."
16309.0,Patient,yeah sure.
760.0,Provider,"So if you're thinking that i'm that this is, I can't it's not i'm not sticking to it and that's what you believe, then, that's in your thought that's creating a negative emotion and then you're going to death becomes self fulfilling. Breaking down that thoughts, if that makes sense."
16309.0,Patient,"But it's it's a bit harder, because I have to add the adc to to that. Yes, but. Yes."
760.0,Provider,But that.
16309.0,Patient,Is an excuse me from still.
760.0,Provider,"Not yeah yeah. Yes, you you, you have yeah what, whatever our barriers are we all have our strengths, we all have our barriers. yeah and we're still so it's just a. You know, a process of working through that and remember it's a practice it's not something you're going to do instantly it's not going to be. Always perfect."
16309.0,Patient,Is it is it okay to say this it's just a waste of time just to have these thoughts stop film enemies. Are judgmental.
760.0,Provider,"It sounds judgmental through through our mistakes we learn. So, even when we're judgmental and hard on ourselves we're learning through that and there's value in that."
16309.0,Patient,yeah. yeah so weird.
760.0,Provider,yeah I know it's weird because it's. it's it's not your normal thoughts.
16309.0,Patient,"Well it's it's weird because i've i've found like success in both modes of thinking like being hard harder on myself to get stuff done sometimes works and, like the fact that i've been so. Like Zen."
760.0,Provider,You can be then and focus that.
16309.0,Patient,This year seems like it's almost like i'm i'm doing this like over analysis of like the Meta awareness of these thoughts and. Just like trying to find an impossible solution and to that I say this whole these all these are waste your time and just better to just directed and here we go that's work and that's that seems to just work a sentence for me.
760.0,Provider,"i've been hard on yourself, though, that has an effect on your mental health. yeah and also your physical health, and you know, maybe we get away with those things when we're younger. But the older we get the less were. able to because those habits, they have more more larger effects and the body can't. heal as fast as it used to so I to that that's one thing I have to consider."
16309.0,Patient,i've lived noticed that for sure. yeah I didn't notice that that's that's one of the reasons why. I kind of fell into this like homeostasis of.
760.0,Provider,Living.
16309.0,Patient,Like relaxing not having to be like on all the time. And I guess that's what that's what the that's what the the the mindfulness is good for.
760.0,Provider,"yeah so remember it's a practice i'm gonna i'm gonna have to go, I have an appointment coming up in like three minutes um. But I think about this, maybe do some journaling on this, and remember it's a practice, I think, next time, can we talk a little bit more about perfectionism does that sound like something that might be helpful to you. And we can keep talking about the mindfulness to but."
16309.0,Patient,No.
760.0,Provider,"i'm thinking some perfectionism might be something, because I think over time that that's going to be more destructive than useful. And that's why I replaced the word excellence."
16309.0,Patient,"Okay yeah I love it. that's Okay, thank you."
760.0,Provider,"Do you have your next appointment, do you know how to schedule it."
16309.0,Patient,Via Angelina I think so yeah i'm going to email yeah.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, all right."
16309.0,Patient,I am is the medication management are you haven't evolved it.
760.0,Provider,I don't know that that. That you can get done in your group.
16309.0,Patient,gotcha okay.
760.0,Provider,Okay that's that's something it's either the first part of the group or the last part of the group you'll be able to adjust your medication there okay.
16309.0,Patient,Thank you.
760.0,Provider,"All right, okay i'll see you, I see you probably in a couple weeks, then. awesome okay."
16309.0,Patient,here's a bye.
