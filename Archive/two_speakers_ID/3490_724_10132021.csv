3490.0,Patient,"horribly. Oh. yeah I was at work, sorry I was at work this morning and I got a call to miss calls from my daughter, I was cooking my clients breakfast. And so I washed my hands and then went to go see what she was calling about so I kept calling kept calling she's not answering. So I call the school like you know my daughter call me and I don't know why i'm you know, can you check and see what's going on in class or whatever. And they're like well class has been studying will call over the intercom then we'll call you back and i'm like alright, so I waited. And i'm at work, so another like 20 minutes passed by I call the school back and i'm like well what's going on, because by this time classes already started for like 25 minutes. Right and i'm like i'm you know what's going on, and they were like oh I forgot. Something for God. OK, so I call they call her classroom they're like Oh, she never showed up to class class started at 830 by the time I go through all of this and talking to them it's like 910. And she leaves her school at 740 from my house and so i'm like what the hell, so they tell me she's not in class I instantly lose my shit. cuz i'm like what are you. she's not in class, so I hang up the phone and i'm just like. What. And and i'm calling her again or calling again everytime I color I i'm losing my breath, I can breathe. So i'm in the garage and i'm crying hysterically and hollering and i'm calling people they're not answering. cuz i'm at work, and so I call my son, he was like Oh, let me call my dad he has my car and i'm like what you and your dad What do you mean. And so I called my mom and she's like okay i'm on my way she probably just walked to school, I said she just walked to school i'm a killer but I need to find my daughter. Right, so I call the school back and i'm like she's not answering but by this time I have a whole new faces no longer mind, because I cried it off. Right so they're like Oh, we will send out an alert he Baba blah blah blah so by this time is 935. The school calls back 941 i'm heading outside to go get in the car and they're like Oh, she just showed up in class and i'm like really mean she just showed up in class. So they're like Oh, the teacher says she just got here so i'm still thinking in my mind I need to hurt her because she should never walk to school, the school is like two miles to now miles away from my house so. And so i'm like no she's not that kind of kid you know to where you know i'm so. I go to the school and when I get to the school and like you know have her come out of the class I need to figure out what's going on and so. The teacher, I mean the office secretaries on the phone with the teacher and the teacher is telling her that Oh well, she came in, with a note, she was in the nurse's office, but he failed to tell the secretary that that's where she was, but she could tell me over the phone."
724.0,Provider,Oh God.
3490.0,Patient,"So when I get there i'm like what. So I went from losing my shit to mad at my daughter today i'm not the Lotus kula because you're lost my child for two hours. Right. And so I give her get with my daughter my daughter was like Oh well, I left this morning and my head was hurting. And so I got on the bus and he started hurting worse and I started crying So when I got off the bus. I told the teacher she told me okay eat breakfast is the feel she was like I couldn't eat, so I went back to the teacher the teacher call the nurse the nurse is not her teacher. When the teacher called the nurse the nurse was like okay send her over where I am and then. The ball not there, I dropped the ball, the ball is no longer on the Court at this point. Because nobody knows where my daughter is, except for the nurse, which nobody ever thought to call I would never have thought that, because at that time I my mind, is completely gone, because my daughter is missing um but they kind of like national like well she's here. yeah like oh she's here now, what are you really and I had to suppress my whole black mama. So I had to go whoops so now i'm going to call the the office mom speak with the principal like that is unacceptable. There is no way. That my daughter was at school, all of that time and nobody knew or thought to call the office because because of coven they have changed the nurse's office to a separate classroom instead of inside the Office like it normally is right, so they. didn't you didn't think to to call and see and then, when the when they're over the walkie talkie everybody can hear it so nobody heard and then you guys sent out the so called alert that she's missing. And nobody said hey Oh well, we heard or the. nurse on nobody responded to the so called. alert that you put out that there's a student missing, and she was missing a whole nother 15 minutes and so i'm like Okay, well, we have a very serious problem and it's it's you're gonna. Have issues anxiety issues anger issues so i'm very proud of myself actually for not going ape shit in there because that's normally what would have happened um but I kept my composure it's not because i'm on probation."
724.0,Provider,But.
3490.0,Patient,"But I just needed to for them to understand, I need from London hear me and not oh she's hysterical. Talk to the principal tomorrow but i'm really considering. Changing her to lay. A K 12 school where they have like two of each grade and each class has like 15 to 20 kids in it that they have here. they're all in one building is not a big old school everything's like boom boom boom right there and they have very. Extreme security, and all this stuff because i'm like I need to know what's going on my kid at all times i'm that mama i'm not the moment that don't care and send their kids to school for babysitting i'm not that mom so I literally my clients were like are you okay and i'm like. And i'm really just was like I i'm very surprised that I handled the way I did once I was in the office, because they would have caught me about six months ago I probably would have been in jail, because I probably wouldn't not far from wanting to ask for losing my job."
724.0,Provider,"Right and there's there's a bigger problem here at stake, to now that you've had time to sit back and think about it it's that there's been. A series of breakdown in communication and that's fine a good in some places, but in that setting, that is not a setting where you should have. That kind of a breakdown there redundancies that are in place to ensure safety of kids should never get like that there should be a checklist Protocol before you send out an alert, it should be like. Okay she's not in the class contact the bus the bus driver you remember seeing the person get on it, you know, like."
3490.0,Patient,"You know what it's all. about the bus part is funny that you mentioned that. With the school district that my daughter goes to they have to have an actual bus pass that when they get on the bus, you have to scan it or you can't get on the bus, you have to scan it when you get off the bus so it's like. You guys quitting don't see yeah. yeah like you guys couldn't. check to see you know that she got on the bus because i'm thinking that that I that I had to get on her for walking. She knows better so her, she has the key to the House you go home right hey call me call your grandma call somebody say hey I missed the bus. Because she's here a whole maybe 15 minutes without someone being here. But that's fine she's 10 years old, but i'm just like you can't walk to school is too far and so many NUTS they're crazy out here, we live in fresno you know we live out kind of like. In fields country wise and it's like you know these people they don't have the sense that God gave them, and you know they're taking. Children, I heard on the news that you know, a young boy got lost for four days and in another state, but it's just the thought of that may be so sick and then I just was like this can't be happening like not my baby like Come on, that is the worst feeling in the world as a mother. And my I all I did was try all day she's fine. But just the thought of it really messed me up."
724.0,Provider,Absolutely thought of losing like the most precious thing yeah it's.
3490.0,Patient,"right thing to me yeah really like and when I seen her I just broke down, and there are my. I got time for real like."
724.0,Provider,"You I believe you understand that, like, I was going off of the based off the information that I had at the time, be like. You know, like, if I had the time to explain to you every little nuance you know I had to miss calls, I called you'll be seeing. All these things you know you guys put out an alert and you still can't find it in the whole time she's sitting in your nurse's station it's like like what the Ad you know what I mean like like what are we doing like what are we doing. This is. This is bullshit you know I know it'd be like the GM i'm cool, calm and collective right now but internally like i'm not i'm not happy that."
3490.0,Patient,"my daughter she yesterday I picture of early because she has really bad allergies and stuff and I don't know if you saw the weather in California, but like the winds are. ridiculous here yesterday. Like I it was from like two miles, I was driving down one of our busiest streets here. From work like two miles was completely black like it was the it had knocked all the power out like all of the stores, the lights they weren't even flashing they were just. out, it was black I was like oh my God somebody's gonna have an accident, I pretty goddess on me, I made them safely, but it was really, really bad where it was like thick like the air was tan you could see it. There was that thing. And so I was like okay well I don't want her you know walking home from the bus and all that stuff so I went to pick her up early. She said when she went to the classroom today to go get her stuff because i'm like i'm taking my baby home with me and so when I. She said she went back to the classroom the teacher looked and she told her told the teacher that she was going home and. He looked at her kind of like you went home yesterday early in your mind today like are you, excuse me like what difference does it make like you wouldn't take your your child home when something like that happens is like you're watching him. So what's the plan for being here yeah watching him."
724.0,Provider,"concerned about her now that she's here. Well, you know, perhaps it's probably a good thing that well first off that she's OK, and now you know you've noticed that there seems to be a breakdown and some of the most important rent on the sees that there could be for a kid."
3490.0,Patient,"And right, and you know what this is not the first time last like a couple weeks ago they were like oh that she's been exposed to cope it and had to have her get a test. That is hard for a 10 year olds to do, especially one like my child she saw dramatic and so she's crying and sneezing when trying to take this covert test in her nose and I have to do and i'm like oh. But they OK, so the thing is they sent home they called me on the 13th this was last month, they called me on the 13th and said hey i'm your daughter has been exposed on the eighth and ninth. But they call me on the 13th. So I go to pick her up. And they're like Oh well, she has to have a test before she comes back, and it has to be negative, and if you don't get a test that she has to quarantine for those such as such amount of days. And i'm like all right, so I went and got the test, and I call them back I said, well, I couldn't get a test, this is on a Monday I couldn't get a test or Tuesday that. I couldn't get a test but i'm going to get it, she scheduled for Friday Okay, so I got her the test Monday the results and come back Tuesday, they come back. They call me and tell me that she's at risk for retention because of all the day she mystics of school, excuse me. Like your students and your teachers are the ones that are the reason why she's at home, what do you mean and i'm like and how do you say she's at risk for retention at this day it's barely been a few weeks of school."
724.0,Provider,"yeah and I again I would be like you clearly all you guys are not on the same page it's pretty apparent I got a call that she'd been exposed see y'all sent her home. And wouldn't let her return until she provided negative tests and be like I don't know where you guys have been for the past year and a half, but these tests that take two three days you know your rapid is. Within a few hours, you know what I mean, but if that test was so good, we would just use the rapid tests and beyond, with it, but it's not, which is why they do, that the prn one which takes days right. I know this because, when I worked in the health field to my girlfriend just went to Dante my four year old wouldn't Had it done today, and my. soon to be two year old had all go get get coven swap today because my daughter sick I had to cancel her birthday party on Sunday, because she was. awfully sick and we have friends and family relatives that they're older and some of them like like our caregivers so people that are super bad shape, so we like responsibly we're like. we're gonna have to cancel it I can't have people come oh she's coughing and I don't want to be blamed. My four year old you know got people potentially sick I don't know what she's got you know she Saturday night she caught a little bit it was like whatever know. Sunday morning she or even throughout the night crying all night I gotta say with our most of my she's congested sniffly she's a wreck she woke up looking like shit and I was like I can't have my my my little girl have a party when she's feeling like this looking like this. and have everybody else, so we cancel it right so then Monday was a holiday, it was Columbus day or indigenous people day, whatever that was I didn't even know that they celebrate these days anymore. So she was off, so I was like alright cool so she's off and she's still sick today, so we call. We call her out of school and we're like hey these are safe, is because you can't lie you don't have any God forbid, you tell them that it's probably a cold everybody so nerve wracking i've signed. Letters like you i'm sure you signed all these agreements prior to your kid go on the school that you're going to do all these things, so it has sent all three of them off today to go get coven swell because my girlfriend sick my son sick and my daughter sick and it's. Okay right now. You know i'm cool right now but I bet you a couple days i'll probably be brought down, and we all just."
3490.0,Patient,"Getting you know, some people. don't actually have. Right symptoms so i'm sorry to hear that that's an awful thing. You know they get better very soon."
724.0,Provider,"appreciate it, but, but those are the things that that we have to do, and you know, for your school system to pretend like they're not all on the same page it's like all right, so this is why she's been out like do you even look to see why she has been out. he's out because. You all have multiple exposures if you send people on the quarantine until they're cleared and it's like."
3490.0,Patient,"And then these parents, thank you for being that parent because their kids like I said they use school as a babysitting. And they send them to school anyway, if your kid is sick my daughter sneezes too much, and I know she has allergies. And asthma I i'm still not going to send her, even though I know that's what it is i'm still not going to send her for the simple fact that you know everybody's mind goes straight to that and I don't want them, you know. Making my daughter feel alienated by saying, every time she sneezes around and bias, because there's what kids do. I don't want to expose her. to that. So, but some of these bands, they just don't care and they send them anyway yeah."
724.0,Provider,"yeah you know, like a lot of times like like i'm old school and i'm like. You know how the kids going to build an immune system if they're not exposed to, like other stuff and it's like this is We live in a different world now, and last year. You know, like um she got sent home because she cough like twice like behind her back she calls and I got a call, one day, and she she had no symptoms at home.

3490.0,Patient,"yeah it's it's it's better you know, some people understand that some people over stand it's like okay get you can get it, but you don't got to take it that far like come on. it's it's it's that's just like with anything you know i'm one of those people that they I believe they put this stuff to us like chicken pox and stuff when I was a kid like."

724.0,Provider,"There pretty soft smart. Smart with a lot of things, but they're not. they're not practical smart."
3490.0,Patient,"To defend these they have. Time on their hands, I was watching the news today with the whole. wasn't Mattel about the Barbie and Mr potato head and all that stuff. So, so no but i'm like there's already a Mr potato head it Mr potato felt like he want to put on a hat just get Mr potato head tag put it on it. Like I don't understand there's two types of people on earth male and female that's it like come on just keep it moving like you don't have to do all that, like that's wonderful you feel like you want to be that way."
724.0,Provider,You would ever want to.
3490.0,Patient,Do whatever you want to do with your life but don't try to make everything about you there's so many people in this world. to worry about whether you want to wear skirts or pants.
724.0,Provider,"yeah and honestly like by and large, the majority of people in this country they don't really care what you that's what's beautiful about the country you know what I mean like. The freedom to move about the spaceman do whatever you want like I don't care what you do you don't care what I do, I might not like what you do, but that doesn't mean that i'm going to suppress you, you know I mean like. I don't have to agree with everything that you do, and like you know what I mean like that's just but that's what's cool about this country is that you have that option i've been the Third World countries and. i've seen what they do to people that they don't agree with and it's not pretty and if that type of stuff happened here. know people would change their tune real quick and like that, like a lot of people want to act like they have it tough and and they probably do in certain certain respects, but. In the grand scheme of things and sometimes it's hard to see where we can't be objective and look at like the bigger picture. But you have the luxury here. To be as happy or unhappy as you want to be, you know I mean without. A little bit no interference."
3490.0,Patient,"You know what a lot of people here too I found that they will be a lot more happy and a lot less stress if they worried about themselves and other people it's like if you're worried about Stacy and faces worried about Stacy who's worried about you. Like you, you you don't have the mental capacity to that you're, the most important, I had a conversation with the young lady she said that um what would I do if it was a situation where I was pregnant and it was saved me or saved my child. And I was like save me. As she was like, how can you say that I said, because I have other children. I was like there is a potential that I can get pregnant again or that I can have a get a child that it, you know there's parents that don't. Take care of their children that I can adopt or something like that nobody could take care of my kids the way I take care of my kids. And in I Being myself know that I can deal with the loss of my child I wouldn't want my children to deal with the loss of me at that at depending on their age. Like I can you know I can I can I can fix me, you know, but I wouldn't want my kids to have to deal with that if they don't have to that as a traumatizing thing for a child to have to go through that this child is unborn and know nothing of the world it's like you know I can. move on and still help contribute not in its not being selfish is being selfless because I want to take care of my children."
724.0,Provider,Right yeah and what good are you if you're dead.
3490.0,Patient,"Exactly and the baby is no good to them, because what can they do for them now, if it was a difference, and it was I don't have any other children okay. that's fine, but if I have other children that I need to take care of attend to know, I want to be here for my kids period because nobody's going to protect them and take care of them."
724.0,Provider,"Like me, before he will exactly."
3490.0,Patient,"yeah she she just was like well, I would say, say my child because i've been on this earth that's fine, but if there was an option."
724.0,Provider,"that's altruistic but not practical sometimes and you got to be practical. Right, you have to carry on."
3490.0,Patient,and logically what the situation actually is right.
724.0,Provider,"yeah so when we talk about being like like utilitarian Is this the word for the greater good, the definition of utilitarian is the greater good, you know some of the needs of the many are outweighed by the needs of the few right. Right, you would lose the the altruistic approach would be like. i'll put everybody else's needs before my own, you know where you would admit that you'd like Okay, no that's that's being a true altruism right, but sometimes it's not practical."
3490.0,Patient,"Right there's just like, how can you save your children if you can't bri know. Like they tell you on the on the airplane or would you put your mask on person that you're able to help this person, you can help them both y'all can't breathe."
724.0,Provider,Right exactly yeah.
3490.0,Patient,makes no sense.
724.0,Provider,"yeah some people that Do you know what I mean that they just don't they don't have the LIFE exposures to like hard life and not that that's great, but you do learn a lot, you know what I mean it's not great to have like."
3490.0,Patient,"To pass on. to other people when you're a lifelong learner and that you pay attention to those things i've seen a lot of things in my life. More than a lot of people my age. Have and you on YouTube um you know we come in we're a few and far between is not too many people like that that have paid that much attention. and have those type of lessons in life, and we are meant to be here to help to pass that along you know to our our young people and people who are of our age who don't like I have a friend, she does silliest thing and i'll be like I try to teach you for Jesus. But you know people, but people didn't think that I mean and i'm like no, I have a motto in life, I am fair farm a consistent in everything that I do. So you know it things happen, but i'm always gonna bring myself out of it, I know my strength and that's why I am where I am right now is because. Yes, something happened to me unfortunate that I had no control out of it's not like, I chose this for myself, but i'm coming out of it, speaking of that I told Dr learned about my. That day I made about. 40 minutes shy of 24 hours for the not taking this trip oh. yeah yeah I was like okay I can't take it. But."
724.0,Provider,yeah for the threshold for.
3490.0,Patient,"yeah but then he was like well no don't do that I need you to. Instead, I need you to take it for a few more months and i'm like I am not one to be putting things in my body, if I don't have to. So i'm going with my body is telling me I understand what he's saying, but at the same time, my body is like okay you don't need this right now that's just like you saying. Oh, you just ate a big old thanksgiving dinner, but since this person brought your plate you're just going to eat it because they're know your full. Like that makes sense to me."
724.0,Provider,"yeah I I on the side of you know. You know if the patient is like this is kind of what I want to do, but I try to be as supportive within that makes sense now if you were like a train wreck. all over the place, and your environmental factors and we talked about that it's like support networks and and financial stability and housing stability and occupational stability if that was a complete disaster. And you weren't present like the way that you are with inside of intelligence and. Some apprehension all that kind of stuff that I would be like Absolutely not. you're not nowhere stable right you're not stable in these areas and that those are the foundational things that you need to have stability in because you can't. You can't fix yourself if everything else is screwed up to right, so if you're stable, then, as a result, all those other things become stable, not the other way around, so. right if that was the case of like no don't play around your medication, you probably need to be on for a few more wants to get all the other he's doing, but you have. A lot of positive things going for you, currently, so why not try. to tighten up this last this last thing that's holding you back you know, to a certain degree, why not try play around and see if you can gave it a little bit and then. develop like a game plan to either be like yeah maybe you will say on it for the next three months but you'd be tapering for the next three months to you hit zero. it's setting up the near future goals, but right now around with some ideas like how you're."

So and there's people who has been on it for 1015 whatever i'm X amount of years and i'm like okay well I don't want that, for my life, but then I came to the realization that the hardest time that I have is when i'm going to sleep. So i'm like I think I will be okay with using that just to go to sleep, but even last night I was so tired, because I work two jobs now so i'm so tired that I went to sleep. Without it, I didn't take any yesterday, so I just want, I just want to sleep, and so I woke up this morning and about 738 was like hey Hello. Take me now and I was like oh gotcha okay. So I took a half and then went on, with the rest of my day. But I I can be okay, with a half or half you know every night that's fine, but I just didn't want to be like oh. it's 12 o'clock I gotta go, you know I don't want to do that you want to live my life I stopped counting my days of sobriety. I don't know where I am right now, and I just know that i'm okay i'm good today and that's it so that's all I need to know I don't need to count at first, I did because I just was like okay i'm going to work to this or that or is that. My my goal is to live my life every day and that's what i'm doing so and i'm. bro i'm extremely happy. sephora minus a few leaves little silly folks but as far as my life is as a whole i'm very happy and i'm very proud of myself. So you know, there was a point where I didn't. think that I would be here and that's normally not me. But I was very at a control and I was like no that's not me i'm i'm always in control of everything I got going on, so you know i'm back there. You go."
724.0,Provider,"you're strong like you're strong you get the willpower you know and a lot of like. You know, being strong willed comes with like a level of being stubborn. and hard on yourself, and those are all those are all good attributes to have you know what I mean like you're not stubborn to the sense to, we are not open minded it's not like God you can't tell me shit stubborn it's just like. stubborn and disciplined there's like fine lines between the two there's a fine line between stubborn and arrogance. or ignorance, you know, like they're just all these little three lines as long as you're doing the right stuff and it's working for you then. stick with what works never tell him never deviate but like okay i'm going to change what's been working for me now see if this where it's like know if this thing is keeping you straight. And you stick with that, and you only just reinforce that that mindset and you're doing it now, you know what I mean like not keeping it keeping a date. that's a good thing, some people they attach a value system, the numbers it's like weight loss or weight gain or money or whatever it is, and they're like once they hit that number through like yeah that's what I want. But oftentimes people aren't happy with that and then it just move the goalposts down it's like well I want this number, and I want this now it's like you're chasing late like this thing. that's it's abstract you know what I mean opposed to just like all you want to gain weight don't worry about the number don't get on the scale I need to gain 20 pounds of mass I want to be yoked. Just lift heavy eat a lot, and if you feel good and you're getting the results you want the gym cares how much you weigh in women it's like if I weighed 120 130 pounds i'd be super happy and it's like well diet and exercise are already doing that don't worry about the number because. way to fluctuate. Depending on what time of day us weigh yourself on skill, I know people that are in really good shape. put their their their weight number of super high not what you would expect, like and you're like whoa but if chicks are like oh no, it has to be this number it's like well I don't people that hit that number they look like shit."
3490.0,Patient,Right.
724.0,Provider,"Oh don't do that either hammered you know what I mean like you. Just you know, whatever your goals are due until you feel happy like you said and don't worry about this abstract concept, because what is a number be really cool is it. can't touch it it's not tangible, what is it that you're just doing it for you that's bullshit if you're happy that's all that counts."

I feel like i'm in a very good space and I told you before we're talking to those doctors and then the other counselor to try to get me to have and i'm like no I was like.
