And you know I mean I and, like, I have a little bit of anxiety that I pretty well and I I I thrive under pressure, you know I love being being feeling jittery whatnot. Okay, but it's something that he recommended. So I forgot who it was but uh. I wanted to. get it in a book it's a book it's called the monkey mind I think there's several versions of the monkey mind but there's one that. has to do with anxiety and. Another one has to do with. Some being a perfectionist. Okay, in in 30 days. Interesting yeah but uh Oh, and I I watched the entire Ted talk with Bernie brown it was amazing, thank you for bad I love it I absolutely love it, I had to like watch it from the beginning again is that.

13088.0,Patient,"um well I. I figured out will try finally figured out where you got a. Cheese courage over comfort. From and you know choose a why I should stick with bernal vulnerability. And just listening to her stories with her and her husband and. yeah I mean she was it felt like as if she was speaking to me. yeah you know it really it really hits home, and there are a lot of things that I just need to. That I need there's a lot of brutal hard facts that I actually need to face and just come to terms with it and accept it, and you know what. You know what it is, you know how it's going to be. don't necessarily have to be optimistic optimistic that one day, this will be over and have a you know, a set and date as to when this whole. debacle i'll be a blessing would end but just have faith that you know everything will get better along along you know along the way."
148.0,Provider,Right trust your process.
13088.0,Patient,"process. Right. And then I chose courage. Before coming on to this trip, I was a. Few a couple of co workers reached out to me. With my boss, knowing my former boss. and invited me to their their their holiday celebration this December 11. And you know my my department, they did they do it big you know they do it big and. They were wondering if I would like to MC it. and make it a surprise. and It took me a long it took me a long time to respond. Right, this was before the flight. And then I think like hours before the flight and. sitting on it and contemplating about it. And excited about it, I said yes, I mean i'd love to you know. i'd love to see everyone again, and you know it'd be nice to like. You know just pop up the crowd and you know, making sure I know what's the itinerary and coming up next who's performing next and it's going to be in a really big venue. That they're renting out and some. golf clubs Center or whatever. so nervous, you know. I love being nervous and it's going to be. it's going to be fun."
148.0,Provider,"Would you say stepping out of your comfort zone, a little bit for you right now."
13088.0,Patient,There you go I I yeah I couldn't even put it into those words. So.
148.0,Provider,good thing right we've do that as a good thing.
13088.0,Patient,yeah because that that shows that i'm you know choosing courage. You know i'm being courageous and trying things that. That are hard to do. Right. right when you know.
148.0,Provider,That you're choosing growth.
13088.0,Patient,"yeah yeah and I, and I feel it, I feel it and and actually you know I I my my family and I we frequent a while. The last time you went was an April, for we went for two weeks, and before we had left before we had left. For Hawaii I knew that I was going to be investigated about my drug addiction. And being in Hawaii for two weeks back in April every single day I just put up this false facade of me being happy and every smell was fake and the pictures. Of course I wanted you know my my children and wives have like the best time of their lives, but. Knowing that I was going to be investigated by the time I fly back home, you know, really. put a damper on my hawaiian experience, the last time around, but this time around, you know, I have a few you know, I have a few months of under my belt being clean and. I now remember what i'll get it feels like to to just stretch, you know and not to have any worries. So."
148.0,Provider,"You acknowledge that progress you've made in the last six months, where you're at today."
13088.0,Patient,"yeah I. mean I could feel it it's sense it. i'm not gonna lie, I mean I go through you know I go through little obstacles here and there and I. Are you i'm. quick to stumble again, but I always pick myself back up. But. You know i'm just getting used to things you know, but I don't want to get too complacent, you know i'm always i'm always keeping my guard up and being vigilant and being cognizant. I tested today I brought all my requisition papers and I tested today and I knew was you know I knew my choices my my. My choices of venues were were pretty slim, so you know I went to consent, and I know the long time is wait I checked in at 729 I walked out at 847. But you know. i'm fine with it, I wasn't upset I wasn't dragging my feet, you know mad at the world, you know why, why does this company have to test me while i'm on vacation you know. Thankfully wasn't yesterday because yesterday was at a wedding was big you know we have to be it started at two, we have to be there, you know. I don't know like like seven o'clock you know because it like pictures and. Right my girls hair getting ready, because they were flower girls. So, so that was a. That was that. And also. there's this, this is really biggest probably think it's a really big thing for my. Both my daughters go to parochial school and there's a big annual fundraiser event that's held every year last year was skipped because the pandemic, but that to previous years prior to that I they chose me, you know they they they wanted me to MC. This annual auction and they keep on asking me. And they asked me again and. And in it, we rake in 10s of thousands of dollars from different like big companies and all the parents and stuff, but this time around. Somebody texted my wife and wanted to know if Charles would want to MC this next upcoming. auction. And I said no. No. I want to deep down inside, I want to know well, no my wife said, you know what let's let's skip this one. let's skip this one and i'm like Okay, and I listened to my wife, you know I listened to my wife. I like to be really loud, you know I love speakers. And it's going to be held outdoors and being held outdoors is going to be like. You know it's a it's a residential community and I don't want to be loud if it wasn't held indoors, then I probably would have been quoted to say yes, but I don't know I just kind of maybe that's what's that's another part of my. My. Step four. characters of defects that i'm working on I I hate not being in the spotlight."
148.0,Provider,"Well, the fact that you were able to say no, I think, says a lot."
13088.0,Patient,"I said no, and I didn't give any I didn't necessarily give any reasons why. But uh. yeah I you know I said, can you tell her that. Now it's not a good time, perhaps, perhaps next year I would I would consider it."

And you know my family knows that, so it was just pod all day. passion fruit orange juice and glover. that's it. With regard to how this all started with regard to opiates and pills, I have no cravings or just haven't had any triggers I have, I thought about it, yes. Of course needles weren't necessarily my thing but walking here I it's use the public restroom behind that big tree and there was a couple of four inch caps on the floor. I knew what they were and they did bring back any memories of pumping yes and did I have it today, it triggered me know and what was I thinking. I was thinking of you know. Before praying for closing before like the third step prayer or to surrender your prayer. right before any or a meetings and they always you know pray for the addict who still suffering so i'm not gonna lie, you know, while urinating I I just said. pray for the addict is still suffering that's all I said I mean it wasn't much of a prayer it was just a thought I don't know if I said it, or just thought of it but yeah I mean it's you know it's it's Everywhere you think about it all the time i'm you know you see it on TV."
