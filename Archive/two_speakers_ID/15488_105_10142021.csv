So this is our first time meeting on our sort of low pace, you know after that very intense bio psychosocial and i've been slowly kind of hearing little bits about know. You you know, maybe a little bit here and there. Maybe we could start with that, how are you experiencing being in the group setting what is that, like, for you."
15488.0,Patient,"Being in the group. Ideas thinking about how you go about other things in life. That, I would like Tina the staging you already do the transition from one. team to my as best as a start like said, I mean. Just basic. For energy to help people get Ryan nice when you help with things that easier for them. MySpace focused on growth. Because we need to focus on."
105.0,Provider,"and interpret personally what it so those that's content that's what was talked about maybe you're noticing some tips and pointers in a group setting. But what about what on an emotional level what is it like for you to be in a group, how do you feel emotionally when you're there."
15488.0,Patient,Thinking about a partner in my life to where it. says still or i'm happy. to be here with you.
105.0,Provider,"move back just about a foot, let me see if it helps the audio okay. Let me see if I heard correctly, I think you said. nope. I don't know what she said.

105.0,Provider,"and I think. i'm just going to quickly look at some of the goals that you and I talked about when we first met. and I think you touched on this in group, too, and it was about wanting to change your automatic thinking. From from a sort of violent response to. Maybe something. healthier, you know healthy communication, a healthy behavior. Maybe we could start there, maybe you could tell me something let's say this week where your thought was, I want to hit this person, I want to do something violent just so I can be let in an example of what how your what your triggers are."
15488.0,Patient,"That question cuz i'm to my vocabulary. To read as far as going to get. An issue, but it was like you."
105.0,Provider,"know. And I don't know what you mean so i'm going to it's about the audio i'm pretty sure i'll be able to get what you're saying, but I can't quite let's try this are you on a phone, are you using a phone. Okay, so for individual uh huh see if you can turn them off and let's just go with the phone audio let's see if that improves it you don't need it for individual therapy, I might be able to hear you better. i'm hoping, I will let's see if it helps. If not we'll go back, but i've."
15488.0,Patient,That better.
105.0,Provider,"So far it is yes, actually so so here's what i'm kind of looking for again just trying to sort of enter your world a little bit. Maybe this week, think of interaction, maybe with someone and just tell me what happened, I was talking to my cousin my cousin popped off and I wanted to punch him, that would be a story like just let me in something that happened so that I can kind of see. No don't make it up."
15488.0,Patient,"Issues like that, this week, I mean. No, no issues like that about somebody getting smarter looking bad to me or wanting to fight like that so i'm doing great. discipline."
105.0,Provider,"So it is convenient that this week, it is convenient that this week, you were not provoked so what we're doing right now is you're trying to teach me about when it does show up so want you to think of a time when you did feel a bit violent when was that."
15488.0,Patient,"when somebody or Papa nope you understand the cavalry pop off at the mouth slick like. You know, when you speak with somebody which the body language in your face gestures chose really how you're trying to get across nobody. Well, they come out eunice 90 way or like a disrespectful like. To do this, and if you know, and I mean up stuff but i'm on the streets, and I mean, so you can't really sit there. wouldn't when we're going through. Is it my own style."
105.0,Provider,When be the song.
15488.0,Patient,"If you live alone shoes. You lived in Nice, you know, an ego about on her situation that you run into with certain types of people and."
105.0,Provider,"So. Possibly So when I what you did was share a general description, when someone POPs off I am watching. nonverbal body language I know what they really need, and then you get offended and then you want to solve it with violence, but what i'm looking for is an actual story. So i'm going to i'm going to give you an example of what i'm looking for. hey Saturday I ran across so, and so, and he said this, I did this, it says, if I were a fly on the wall and I was watching and listening so if you don't mind just tell me a story of something that happened, where you felt that violence Problem Solving and you."

And said for this person on you and me and my dad's trader, no matter for me or not, so I got man like How is this guy gonna tell anybody pushing, especially the person I brought over here. To that that mean to the trader So when I opened the trader and I told this girl I don't you have what we said it's not even trader, and I mean. And I was doing her a favor because I ran into a DEMO and then we moved her her stuff from there and then what was going to take you to the trailer park right."
105.0,Provider,"hold on hold on hold on hold on. Let me have a name for female because it's weird to say female. Just you can make it up, I don't care. What her name is. Casey Casey so let me understand this Jim says hey don't go in the trailer you went so far as not only did you go in you move here. hold on hold on, let me just say it you move Casey stuff into the trailer is that right."
15488.0,Patient,"No, I just came with her we went to the backyard or stuff was in the vehicle our vehicle my mother's. he's leaving my ass. So we go out to visit me and then I guess what. He learned. But he left turn inside of the trader and just told her there lots of trading when you're in here don't let nobody in especially me, and I mean."
105.0,Provider,"OK, so now, I have a different story so Jim. So, Jim has Casey come in the trailer."
15488.0,Patient,"know I went we went to the moon got into the backyard me in case he went to the back, it was my cousin and a couple friends. Okay, after they visited whatever were visiting why they were visiting student I came inside but my cousin and after that time period I was inside so he locked the door or told her to shut the door on it, nobody in here to the train. Especially me Okay, so when I went back out to look for Jim I knocked at the trade adorn she goes and who is like if it was her trigger and you know, a new girl me open and done, and she goes i'm not an open under say, well, even better, open doors, you know I mean wherever. And I got mad and I started to be a beat the lockout to train me that you know you don't come over here in this is great when a stranger, most of all this into my cousin is 19 years trader me but to let not let me and specifically that's what that man, I mean like I brought you. I brought her from the moto just to help her get her stuff some and then you want to sit in on a new trailer you know."
105.0,Provider,"Okay, I think i've got I think i've got an idea. So I can't wait to talk to you for a minute, and this will probably be a theme and you'll hear it in group also and it has the word boundaries."
15488.0,Patient,"Okay, I knew and a fishnet happening in front of me. it's not affecting me, and I can reality tip here in this all this person said this or new person said that about you, if you guys send me tell you they could tell you me. And it's. You. Know it's like I grew up in the penitent so. My last I was gonna be way different meaning history for suboxone."
105.0,Provider,Know i've worked with people that have have 1720 years incarcerated.
15488.0,Patient,"You and your stories you're at, but their stories or whatever, but I don't do stories, I mean us for Librarians and book fairs."
105.0,Provider,"Okay, no, no, no, no okay so just listen for a minute okay. Just. So, you know how you are aware that your language and the words you have the ones you use. hold on. Because we're talking over each other, I won't hear you the Tele Tele health is hard so just let me talk for just a second. You know how you were starting today saying my vocabulary is this, so you have words that you use on a regular and including phrases like know what I mean and you feel me so you use those a lot you'd agree right. I know what i'm saying, and you feel me, I know what I mean. Okay, well, I understand them, but I might not use them as often and I I happen, I spent a few years, where you were doing something else I was spending a couple years reading a bunch of words and memorize those words that's The only difference. that's all I just memorize some I took time and did it but there's no difference between the fact that. Right now let's take the definition of the word story so right now we have a slightly different definition, the only reason why I said story hold on. Is because I wanted you I was trying to find a word that we had in common that's all. that's all you know I might have also said, all right tell me what happened that's another way to phrase, and it means the same thing as tell a story so that's all it's just. You and I have we may have words in common. But our definitions might be slightly different so all we have to do is take our time and explain them a little more until we have the same definition."
15488.0,Patient,So you'll hear me.
105.0,Provider,"You filming. And i've worked in a felony drug court for 14 years and I I can certainly I have a lot of fun with language I think language is just the coolest thing. there's it's fun, I can be quite serious I can be quite playful also um it's it's still we have our own definitions of these words and we need to be careful because I might step on your toes by accident I won't mean to. But I want to understand Oh, what did I say how did it affect you so I might want to check in on how my word the definition might be different than yours so right now, when I say this tell me what happened it's the same thing as tell me the story means the same thing okay."
15488.0,Patient,Okay.
105.0,Provider,"All right, so um. I know I can ask you is there is there, another way that you would you would ask someone hey man what happened, like How would you ask that question, if it was your style."
15488.0,Patient,"depends, who you're speaking with."
105.0,Provider,Okay well. pretend is me.
15488.0,Patient,"speaking to you. For instance, they were what happened. I said. You in this person went on."
105.0,Provider,What went on.
15488.0,Patient,"went on over there, like what's a half, so there. Was there was going on, he just asked me. yeah good. They are good and where you're writing is it cool."
105.0,Provider,"Well, what will happen with what's the hacks is that we would get a summary everything's fine now, but that isn't what I wanted, I wanted to hear what they did. You see, I don't want a summary I was looking for what did they do you gave it to me anyway so let's let's move away from that for a little bit and just agree there'll be times when you and I might use different words. And then we'll take a second and we'll define them we'll make sure we have the same meaning, I wanted to take today and talk to you a little bit about one word and it's the word boundary. When you were incarcerated. You had physical boundaries of a locked door. Right. That word mm hmm yeah and it was a small like you had yourself. Did you share a cell with someone."
15488.0,Patient,"Yes, I do."
105.0,Provider,"Okay, was it important. Was it important to you that your bed or your stuff was respected. That is a boundary. My body is also a boundary. my mind, is also a boundary so watch. If I put words in your mouth, and I say I know what you're thinking you're thinking this you feel this would you start to go hey that's not true for me and kind of have a feeling that someone was crossing over a mental boundary."
15488.0,Patient,"He said, and then you put in effect, to see if it's true or not really different thing yeah I would say so."
105.0,Provider,"So you know when someone if I said, the phrase mind reading mind reading is that a term you've ever used like if someone's trying to read your mind as if they know what you're thinking, but they haven't asked you. not really. Have you ever noticed. Have you ever noticed someone do that sometimes our family does it they act like they know what's happening in here, but they haven't asked us. Okay."
15488.0,Patient,"same difference in your room into jail, you know mean like those incense i'd be like. You know it'd be. Good to come, because you are, how to say you learn everybody's a routine."
105.0,Provider,uh huh.
15488.0,Patient,"mean you do to number whatever in your routine is it's, this is not sending your team that kind of weird like well what's bothering you say, not in which keep looking at me like receiving what I mean like what what are you thinking, I mean you plot and and. that's about it, and I mean. like that. there's more sickness, since we don't know I mean I don't know nothing about the conversation you had with anybody in the day room and some just somehow some way just. had had came out on Twitter at my head to do a sound, similar to what you're talking about an NSA what like. What the hell, you know your your your husband, you know I mean your husband's been a nosy just like paying attention over here would be nosy stuff like that that's a boundary to that. You know what do you think reading my mind are we missing my head. Right so."
105.0,Provider,"we're getting closer we're getting closer. Look just review just I just want you to take away a couple of things about this word boundary because eventually it's going to be relevant for you when you're managing your anger. we're starting here when I have to pick a place to start and so i'm starting with this very important word of boundary and boundary is basically. it's who I am and who this other person is so, for example, I could be crossing a boundary crossing over to someone else emotional boundary if I said. Oh, I know you don't like me or I said I know what you're thinking you really don't want to go to the party when I do that i'm crossing over and i'm making up a story about what they're thinking about i'm crossing an emotional boundary."
15488.0,Patient,"assuming it is just. bullshit I mean. I don't know if you heard I well, I know you went whoa but why don't you just asked me, I mean."
105.0,Provider,"So, so in looking at me just look at me I could I would be crossing an emotional boundary if I said to my friend, you don't love me watch that's me crossing the boundary And why is that i'll tell you, because I didn't ask I made an assumption, and I guess. Based on their behavior but I made that up, and so, if I was a well a good boundary person, I would say, I see you didn't invite me. I feel unloved. And I might say, do you love me."
15488.0,Patient,Go trip. go fishing.
105.0,Provider,"No, so no guilt trip what I did not do is guilt trip what I did was share how I feel I said I feel. Maybe abandoned or I feel rejected, and then I ask a direct question, do you want me to go to the party and do you love me, I asked the question directly. That is a well boundaries communication I owned my own feelings and I got clarification I asked questions to check out my guessing my assumptions, do you know that word assumption, do you know that one."
15488.0,Patient,I assume.
105.0,Provider,"assume assume. assume it's the same thing my assumptions my guesses. I checked it out with my friend, I said, do you want me to go to the party, do you love me so that's me using healthy communication versus you don't love me you see how I already made up my mind i'm like I know, but I don't know."
15488.0,Patient,fish.
105.0,Provider,Fish in.
15488.0,Patient,"Your body language is this a lot, too, I mean if you are serious, are you, like me, when you speak in body language and facial gestures. It really defines the way you're using that word mean. Wake us and. make us industries. You know if you're backed by like oh that's my. that's my friend that's my boy. right but meaning and watch my dog was up, and you know that hey i'm your dog in the same shit, and I mean. So yeah that's the body language, and then the way they can match you to start a conversation right after that y'all know there is some wax it, I mean."
105.0,Provider,"It might all start for you, with changing the people, the places and the things so for you, it might be, if you keep. spending time with people that are not. elevating you. You might you might still be having a difficult time managing your anger."
15488.0,Patient,"mean if you're keeping around with drug addicts, you need to be."
105.0,Provider,"Also. Also, also. Criminal logical. thinkers if you're spending time with people that use people that steal hit licks etc. you're going to be around people that lie. And that cross boundaries, because to break into someone's car is violating a boundary so if they break into a car, they are very likely to not care about your emotional boundary either."
15488.0,Patient,For you.
105.0,Provider,"Right, but today, but today i'm focusing on trying to teach this term boundaries, so that you really get it cuz you're going to hear it a lot in group. you're going to hear it a lot. you're going to hear about people working on their boundaries, with their family members you're going to hear them working on assertive communication. Instead of showing anger and throwing something across the room they're learning how to be assertive do you know that word assertive assertive. Not so much okay what's a great word it's a it's a good one, but, but today we're just going to do the one and. This is a good one. This one is one that once you really get what it is you actually have a lot of power, you get your power back when you really know where your boundary is and the basic ideas I know where my limits are and. it's important for you to know where those are so you ran across one when you were interacting with Casey. For you, your boundary was. My uncle's trailer let's say is a bit more mine than it is yours Casey."
15488.0,Patient,"Especially jim's me especially the first 30 minutes, let me in my guys trainer. that's like double no question about."
105.0,Provider,"So Casey acted like trailer was hers and you felt it and you got angry. What Casey did was violate I realized Jim to, but I can only talk about one person at a time so Casey violated that and you notice you got angry. Right. There were probably and I don't know Casey, but I think over time, as I start to hear more stories. Again there's that word stories when I hear more of them i'll be able to understand whether there were signs, you know what signs are right, a signal. I may start to see that Casey. The casey's of the world that you saw signs and ignored them My guess is the casey's of the world are giving you signs that they are untrustworthy. hold."
15488.0,Patient,them.
105.0,Provider,"And you are ignoring them so i'm not able to finish my thought so you're going to miss out on the full thought, because you you jumped in. There were probably signs that Casey was. Not someone that respected other people's boundaries and you let her in and brought her over, but really she may not have been trustworthy and so the learning the real learning out here in the Community. is how do we learn, who is trustworthy and who is not it isn't always just in our face okay it's also in the way that they treat us is the what they share they might over share. So it's really learning how to read people accurately out here, because it's different out here than it is in custody. it's different. Okay. Because inside someone. Changes their routine you start to wonder if they're scheming if there's plotting against you. But out here, if someone changes their behavior maybe they're excited about something or maybe they trust you more so, it is really like relearning all over again how to interact with people okay so just have a lot of patience with yourself a lot, a lot of patience. Okay. And i'll get to know you will get to know common language so that you, and I can kind of talk and have it slow. But they'll probably be times when we misunderstand each other here in there."
15488.0,Patient,yeah.
105.0,Provider,"Okay, so i'm just gonna let's focus on anger for just a moment i'd like to know what you already know, we explored this word boundary and you're going to hear a lot about it in the in the as the months come, but. What do you already do let's say anger is here in my hands, what do you do to manage your anger, so that you're not violent, what are the skills you already have."
15488.0,Patient,An encrypted thinking outcome of what the consequences are viewing.
105.0,Provider,"Okay, so I might go to jail is an outcome. yeah okay."
15488.0,Patient,yeah I understand.
105.0,Provider,"So one thing you do is you might check yourself right. Though if oh man, I want to hit this person, but if I do, that I could go to jail. Or, or you could hurt them or you could get her. that's right that's excellent. And do you know anything about how to get the body. to relax."
15488.0,Patient,Calm down you stay.
105.0,Provider,On something else. Okay.
15488.0,Patient,focus. more positive things up in your mind me.
105.0,Provider,Tell me. Tell me some positive things give me five things that you are grateful for.
15488.0,Patient,"Okay, well, maybe the brothers. means family. My girl. This. Just. This once I start thinking about other good things like that, like I just go over here, we take a walk or just. daydreaming they sneak out there and do this guy or whatever or play game. For 10 bucks here some tick tock sound funny. I mean, I heard mess, with the dog, I mean. Sometimes I mess around with them and stuff. anybody's be you know these are jumping on us that every dog. But he's a coder."
105.0,Provider,"You have a good, solid list of things that you're grateful for, and you also have a great list of things to distract you and go do my job I a game walking maybe watching a funny video texting someone calling someone you actually have quite a few skills. Have you been using those and they're working for you so that you do not act violently is that helping you."
15488.0,Patient,"So be me alone. I know I get nervous, are you said last time I was enjoying me anyway go were like golly what's wrong with you, you know I mean i'm night to calm. The prime I say this dude's up to sound because of my i'm just calm quiet, and I mean I don't i'm not trying to be up in trouble, and why not, there are unchanged lot of people tell me, I mean changed, I mean. I take my meds. that's another good one there it. Was. Just the me like where, am I going to be out tomorrow, the next day with the seasons, I mean we're going to affect my staff here in a minute and then after I mean it might be they. Were awesome and then, after that, if if if I take a long term business the wrong decisions, I mean get to a place where there's data just number wrong, you know, and I find myself in a whole. not married, but I can hope for problems and that's all I have to choose out of these problems, I mean which one, I want to go do I mean. he's stuck in a room with him and new things to do and. So if I just sit here and meet all the positive things in America right and then, when we stuck in ruin it requires the things that make you want positive. fit all. Today tomorrow or right now I just got more things of positive to do, I mean I keep looking forward to positive things because it's helping me me. me."
105.0,Provider,"Just as we bring today to a close, just tell me a little bit about the relationship with your mother how, how is the flow of communication between you two."
15488.0,Patient,"Sometimes yeah oh she's tired she's always busy or. I told him awesome because she might be a snowman yes, she said it's all right there, but then it accidentally happens and they see I told you that you know we get over to you know just. Our manager, yes, telling your, thank you for everything I do what I can do me and just be something we're trying to be sorry, even if sometimes."
105.0,Provider,So that's the part that's the part i'd like to understand. How often do you argue with her in a given day which.
15488.0,Patient,"Really. Is. it's mainly the dog like no that's a dog because I he'll be watching me, you know, like when again seven in our hear me running around back forth and we both your dog and I he accidentally gets out and what she kind of gets mad because she's growing grass, but we don't we don't argue. With finding that spot right there to where we could understand each other and just Okay, whatever maybe. yeah you know, whatever I can just like Oh well, but we can understand it is an accident, things are right, sometimes I mean this happened to me excellent Okay, so your code."
105.0,Provider,"i'll get i'll get to know more about your history as as we get to know each other, a little better. But this was helpful. All right."
15488.0,Patient,"Nick you say carry over there you are pretty over there, sorry. I mean, how is the weather been. in Florida. it's a. New scene."
