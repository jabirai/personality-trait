126.0,Provider,"I remember seeing an interview with a guy that had just moved to Hawaii because of all the fires. In California, this was by I don't know, maybe about seven or eight months ago, when one of the volcanoes in Hawaii erupted and.

2504.0,Patient,Take my daughter to like the water park or something.
126.0,Provider,yeah that'd be awesome and super fun.
2504.0,Patient,"Right. um. yeah I don't know why, but I thought, our appointment was Monday I kept thinking Monday and then I got a text message on my phone."
126.0,Provider,Good day.
2504.0,Patient,And I was like oh crap it's today. Totally spaced it. But.
126.0,Provider,"No, we just talked on Wednesday."
2504.0,Patient,You know. that's how my brain is just like one minute it'll be there and then.
126.0,Provider,"And that's why I write everything down there's no way I could remember any of my appointments unless I wrote them down. I get printing on a pad of paper I write everything whatever whatever I need my shopping list whatever appointments I have, and I just keep I keep a book with me all the time and I just right right right, you know, so I don't get stuff because there's plenty."
2504.0,Patient,"yeah well usually i'm really good about putting things in my phone um. You know, after grouping stuff but. Since. I think the reason I didn't put it in my phone is because it was going to be recent, and I was like oh it'll be."
126.0,Provider,"Oh, I can remember that. yeah famous last words."
2504.0,Patient,apparently not.
126.0,Provider,"Well, you know what they do you know how they test you for all timers Have you ever seen that before. With me all right. Oh Oh, because this is funny because I would never pass the test, so what they do is have the Alzheimer patient comes in talking to the doctor and the doctor says okay so we're going to have a conversation at the end of the conversation I want you to remember these three words. thermos sky. desk. Just three let random words and then they talk and talk and talk about you know what what the person can remember what they don't matter. And the doctor talks to the patient for about a half an hour. Just to have like a half an hour, maybe 45 minutes. And i've seen the whole thing and then the doctor says Okay, so what was those three words that I said. Not only can they not remember I can't even remember it was only half an hour ago it's. Real just random words. I yes. I just said, I remember. And I think that's not a good test for all timers because I think a lot of people would not pass that gas."
2504.0,Patient,Right.
126.0,Provider,"Yes, no."
2504.0,Patient,"No, I don't think that's a very good to see you there and it's that's it's not necessarily that you, for God it's that you know when you start focusing on something else that's like you get deep in thought you're you're you know. you're trying to. You know, talk about something that could be very important and. it's just I don't know It just seems like it. yeah. we're not giving you the best test, because I mean. You could end up talking to the doctor about some something tragic that happened in your life."
126.0,Provider,"and your whole concentration is on that right. Now, how are you gonna remember three arbitrary words."
2504.0,Patient,"yeah yeah my memory has actually gotten worse I I used to be like you could tell me, I mean you could. Just tell me like a 10 digit number, and I remember it."
126.0,Provider,"Oh, my God that's amazing."
2504.0,Patient,"yeah and I can remember it like two hours later, or. Even even later that day I could still remember."
126.0,Provider,that's amazing.
2504.0,Patient,"And I used to be able to do that so good, and I always was like really good with especially numbers, not so much word but numbers, I always to do that and now i'm not as good as I used to be, I mean, I can still do some but not that amount of numbers."
126.0,Provider,"Oh yeah numbers for sure not no way, but I used to be so good, with spelling. Always a's and spelling I could spell any word, you asked me. Then about I don't know, maybe about six or seven years ago i've gotten in a car accident and my head hit my when it hit it so hard, but I had a big old one on my head and the airbag came out and everything. And then I noticed a. few months after that, when I would try to spell. I can't spell anymore like I Oh, I can only spell very simple words are you looking for your daughter."
2504.0,Patient,yeah I was checking see what she's doing.
126.0,Provider,"Knowing skills have completely dissolved I can't spell worship now, I have to look words up all the time."
2504.0,Patient,yeah i'm not the best speller so don't feel bad. She was uh. I think she was getting herself some water juice and she made a mess and she was trying to clean it up before I saw.
126.0,Provider,Okay okay.
2504.0,Patient,I don't think. it's yeah all that matters is that she's cleaning it up.
126.0,Provider,"Not that she made the mess. yeah take responsibility, I know my kid when she would spill something she would just stand back and go in like be afraid you spilled it, you can clean it up."
2504.0,Patient,mm hmm.
126.0,Provider,You know.
2504.0,Patient,yeah I think her her first thought is she's gonna get in trouble because her mom tends to react real fast on stuff like that. Member I don't know if it was this last group or the group for but you guys were telling me that i'm seem like a really patient person. i'm definitely more patient with my daughter than her mom.
126.0,Provider,"yeah yeah and that's good that's good, because you know at least she has a little kind of relief when she's with you, she doesn't have to be on edge of spilling things are dropping things, or you know."
2504.0,Patient,"yeah. yeah. that's something I was going to tell you, and. Talk to you and I forgot. what's up. yeah as soon as i'm done with my zoom i'll play this. I know i'll make you dinner okay just let me finish. You I told you, you only got pizza one day okay. yeah. Maybe we'll have something else good tomorrow okay. Not today okay. You heard me. hey Let me finish my zoom and i'll come out there and we'll play. sure. You want to say hi."
126.0,Provider,There are you.
2504.0,Patient,Let me finish.
126.0,Provider,Your. girl. She is adorable.
2504.0,Patient,She she's funny she's like. she's like people always tell me that i'm i'm a really beautiful shoes and then she asked me why am I beautiful dad and I spoke well because you have a handsome dad and a pretty pretty lonely.
126.0,Provider,I don't think I was quite the answer she expected.
2504.0,Patient,But. I had to put myself in their first of.
126.0,Provider,"course yeah you have to give yourself a little credit, you did have something to do with it. I know my kids look nothing like me totally their dad it's like. who had these little. They don't look anything like me nothing."
2504.0,Patient,"that's funny that you say that because, when Tony was born I I, it was the worst possible thing that you can do as the father of the child, when the child is born. yeah it was after Catalonia was born, it was it had been maybe 24 hours and we're sitting in the room it's right that's probably about 930 10 o'clock we're about to go to sleep. They had us in there for five days."
126.0,Provider,which was you have a C section. yeah okay.
2504.0,Patient,She had to because they waited for they waited 30 hours and she had not dilated I think she dilated maybe two centimeters.
126.0,Provider,"Oh, my God that was that's my same story only yeah I was in Labor for 42 hours."
2504.0,Patient,"Oh, my gosh."
126.0,Provider,Before they finally did a C section.
2504.0,Patient,"yeah see you there there, I mean the doctors like to try and get you to have a natural birth."
126.0,Provider,"Well yeah because it first of all it's more expensive and C sections, you have to have two doctors and you stay in the hospital five days, instead of two they don't want to incur all those charges so. It is financially based."
2504.0,Patient,"that's crazy I will well, I mean that was. How long ago. Oh. yeah."
126.0,Provider,For 30 years ago.
2504.0,Patient,"Okay, so 30 years ago I could see them yeah wanting to have two doctors, but when kalani was born there was only one."
126.0,Provider,"Oh, really. yeah okay."
2504.0,Patient,And there were a couple nurses on the staff. That were pretty experience so maybe that was you know part of the whole thing but yeah they. There was the one Doc. And were you.
126.0,Provider,watch them pull her out of her stomach.
2504.0,Patient,"um well, they have like a curtain like for her top of your belly down. And I really didn't want to do that. or not like i'm not a squeamish or anything like it didn't bother me. But I had to kill her mom wouldn't let go my hand either so."
126.0,Provider,anyway.
2504.0,Patient,"yeah uh but then afterwards they cut the umbilical cord, and they started cleaning up cleaning her up and then I got the. I didn't get to cut the umbilical cord first but they brought her over to another table cleaned her up and stuff and then they had me cut like the little piece of them by record off. And I got to do that, and then I saw her um you know our stomach was you know still partly expose open. They didn't even use stitches they used. staples no they didn't use staple they use they use that glue. That uh."
126.0,Provider,"Oh, my God."
2504.0,Patient,yeah it was crazy she had no staple marks know stitch marks or anything.
126.0,Provider,That ends.
2504.0,Patient,"They did it like you know your stomach on the bottom like below on the bottom of your stomach there's kind of like a line right there. mm hmm they cut her right there. So you could. barely even tell that she had a C section. They did. The job so. So she was she was happy with that, even though you know she wanted to have a natural birth, but she was just like after 30 hours she was a slick way, I cannot."
126.0,Provider,yeah my my ex husband had to grab the doctor and say do a fucking C section.
2504.0,Patient,yeah we had to kind. yeah that's ridiculous yeah yeah we even thought 30 was a little ridiculous.
126.0,Provider,he's a little ridiculous to.
2504.0,Patient,"yeah we we yeah we asked several times, where like Can we just get this over with them. Exactly well, apparently, the reason that they wanted to have us wait 30 hours is because. The doctor. Was he started on her ship he started to shift or he was ending his shift, as she came in and then. They induced her and all that. And they thought that she was going to have the baby within like you know, two or three hours. They didn't think it was going to be very long. Well then, he got off and he went home and then like six in the morning, or something he got a call telling them that she's been now 30 something hours. came back, and then they did the C section. But."
126.0,Provider,"All right, so what did you say about the baby after about 24 hours after she was born that dance shouldn't say."
2504.0,Patient,"That. I said this kid looks nothing like me. always like there, there is no way, this is my daughter, I was like. I asked your mom like cassie Is there something you need to tell me."
126.0,Provider,"Oh, my God and you serious."
2504.0,Patient,yeah yeah hundred percent serious and she's like a I don't know what.
126.0,Provider,you're talking about you better get out of my face right but.
2504.0,Patient,she's like you need to leave the room. Right is like that.
126.0,Provider,hell out of here.
2504.0,Patient,"yeah she's like that was so rude of you, and she didn't talk for like a day."
126.0,Provider,"Oh, my God. not believe he said path."
2504.0,Patient,But after kalani was like four months old you could like there's no way you could tell that you could totally tell that she was my daughter.
126.0,Provider,Right right yeah.
2504.0,Patient,yeah more.
126.0,Provider,"modest when they're freshly born here not cute they're not cute they're just like and mine, she was 10 pounds so she was huge who was like a little Buddha was just gigantic and her hair stuck straight up like this, and I was like we're that kid come from.
