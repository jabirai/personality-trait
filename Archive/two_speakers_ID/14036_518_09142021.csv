14036.0,Patient,"Not daily but i'm doing something every day, I remember it pretty well, especially if there's like a. process associated with it. yeah working out i've actually found that if I start like playing a video game, or something after I work out, so I worked out before I started like get on the computer or something more inclined to do it. In you know, an eagerness of the reward after it actually made me more inclined to actually work out and not hate it so much. Which working out now is it starting to feel actually good to do it, so the don't really need the promise of anything after it's a reward in itself."
518.0,Provider,"Okay, see this. This one here, I think you actually have good listening skills."
14036.0,Patient,When i'm interested. In those places. Sometimes.

518.0,Provider,And what's the reason you do that.
14036.0,Patient,arrogance and impatience.
518.0,Provider,Okay. So it's not an inability to use them it's more of arrogance.
14036.0,Patient,"Yes, more like. A cabinet together myself."
518.0,Provider,"Okay, so that's a different so that one doesn't count. about this one, a Voyager is disinclined to begin homework or activities requiring concentration. Definitely okay. And how about that one fails to focus. or makes thoughtless mistakes."

518.0,Provider,kind of.
14036.0,Patient,overarching more when I get something done in its whole entirety instead of focusing on the minutiae of it.

He had he does have some inattentive type criteria for ADHD ADHD including failing to focus on details are making thoughtless mistakes in assignments, he avoids or is disinclined to begin activities requiring concentration he does experience diminished attention span.

Where it's like if I take the medication it's more like i'm able to sit down for a long amount of time, because I know there's stimulants, but it is."
518.0,Provider,"yeah yeah yeah yeah that that proves, you have the diagnosis, because it to a normal person, it would wouldn't have a calming effect it wouldn't have a chill chill effect. So the fact that you were able to sit still while you were on it, you know kind of like it just says yeah he's got ADHD. So what you're asking."
