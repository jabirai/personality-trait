480.0,Provider,Hello. Can you hear me.
7719.0,Patient,"Yes, I can good afternoon."
480.0,Provider,"Hello sorry to keep you waiting first and I was running late, then, because I had another appointment, but. Then I kept trying to let you in and zoom when i'm let me let you in and i'm like that, and so I sent you a message, did you get it, and the we."
7719.0,Patient,"don't know I did it's all right, though I mean I got most of my stuff done this so. yeah anyway. yeah i'm up doing a little better, a little more calm and I kind of got an idea that i've been kind of going over four months, the situation, I was in um. Now I have another one with a family member and I have a question on the group I love it I do like it i've done it before and my confidence has kept me so high. yeah I lost that for quite a few last couple years but. This thing about avoiding things i've never avoided anything in my life i'd like to get in there, get it done and get it passed me, you know i've been that way um, but I would say i'm pretty much resolved with my husband what I went through. And I still hard and I don't really have any i'm getting through the residual on that. That it was hard to avoid, then I couldn't avoid I stayed in the room, a lot, I was here as caretaker for him pretty much. He was emotionally battering to me. Demanding things weren't good enough if I did anything around him he get mad at me for working or whatever it didn't matter what I did I was darned if I didn't do my thing. But anyway, yeah to avoid I don't avoid things, but I did avoid that situation and about the last year and a half, I tried to get him help and stuff like that he wanted no part of it. because somebody in to help him. Because it was hard on me, because I have physical problems too I love them very much don't get me wrong, we had a good relationship for a long time. Is mental was gone, he was oxygen deprived and I understood that, but now my son. I think I mentioned it, he is. they've kind of given license to I don't ask for help, or anything very independent and basically I haven't asked or anything but he comes out says well i'm too busy to do this and i'm to be and that's fine i've been getting by on my own i'm really proud of myself for what i've done. I mean i'm still still it's a work in progress, but anyway, he, like said he's a drinker and anyway, he didn't deal with emotions, he said he just doesn't deal with them, they kind of great Linda the carpet, because I have good relationships with my sisters and my friends and stuff so. Anyway, i'm resolved that i'm not avoiding I talked to them once a week. But i'm not allowed to talk about my health. Anything going on with anything in the code which I quit six months ago, because they don't believe it so you know i'm just trying not to go there, I try to keep the peace. So I thought talk about everything else how he's doing and everything so we're still have conversations is just not. as close as we were years ago so he's changed a lot to i've changed to i'm getting tougher and i'm starting to say no, because i've done everything every time anybody asked me to do something I do it. And i've been controlled, I know that and i'm starting to learn all over again because I tried to keep the peace I don't like after way my dad was yelling and stuff when I was younger. I don't deal with to help well at all and that's why my sister's just like I am and i'm about ready to start paying her because I talked to her in the beginning, like four times a day and she's gotten me through a lot of this cuz she's gone through similar. older than me. she's older than me and she's been a real blessing us I probably wouldn't be where i'm at today but anyway, I do understand a lot of this and I am getting through it and processing it. haha but I didn't want to ask on the avoidance my son I don't never stopped them for coming over calling or anything but they live in chaos and they're angry all the time about everything, and I can't I can't be around that. Calls me or comes over that's fine I don't initiate anything, because if I say anything and he offers to do something for me, and I say well on your schedule is fine. Then he'll start getting upset later and and start yelling about what he did for me so that's why I don't ask it's hard to explain all this because I don't operate that way. When I say i'm going to do something I do it and and I i'm happy to do it. This is just really a dysfunctional. clustered math and like I said but i'm doing better, as long as I keep it at arm's distance So if you have. Any advice for me please let me know."
480.0,Provider,"So I mean, I think that you're you're looking at it the right way, I mean you're leaning on the supports that are positive and they're supportive for you. So, like your sister you're leaning on her she's great for you she's helping you through. The people that you feel are going to negatively impact the situation, such as your son because of just the way that he is with the drinking and the chaos and all of that you're not necessarily avoiding it but you're not looking for it either."
7719.0,Patient,Correct correct you're exactly right i'm not out looking for it.
480.0,Provider,So it's not so.
7719.0,Patient,I lost the sound here. I lost the sound I can't hear you.
480.0,Provider,hi there.
7719.0,Patient,yeah I can hear you now I couldn't hear you you cut out.
480.0,Provider,"You froze happened, it was like where'd you go. So um so when you know when he comes over it's not like you don't talk to him or let a man, if he calls you talk to them so you're not avoiding but you're not seeking him out because he is not somebody that's a good support to you right now."
7719.0,Patient,He has.
480.0,Provider,"He, I think."
7719.0,Patient,"He can, if he didn't he didn't support me through my husband he only come over for 10. minutes over the day when my husband would call to get through something and he'd be out the door, I had to make a put a mask on because my husband had lung problems but. We would, I asked him if he would I didn't make them but I asked him if he would but yeah but they never stayed here, except holidays, when I could I could holiday dinner, since I was 20 every holiday season. And I tried to keep doing it things as normal as possible, but I get along i've been getting along, for months now i've been practicing this for six months pretty much. Almost six months. yeah it seems to work if I do it this way it's been working in the last couple. pretty well. uh huh oh."
480.0,Provider,"Sorry. I think that way it's good for you, because, like I said. you're surrounding yourself with the people that provide you with the support that you need not necessarily avoiding your son, because you love him and he's your son."
7719.0,Patient,I love him very much.
480.0,Provider,"yeah, but I do know that he's not able to give you what you need he's not going to help the situation so for you that's a good decision um I think that it's important that at some point, you tell him how you feel, though, about the way that he has."
7719.0,Patient,"and never be able to I couldn't never do that I if I did, it would blow up so bad I don't have to say anything."
480.0,Provider,yeah.
7719.0,Patient,"I don't have to say anything I gotta be honest with you Stacy I have sat through years with his girlfriend they've been together, seven years. and her buying the two year old with gun and I bit my tongue let her play with pill bottles. And just put like to put I think I mentioned it in the beginning, push my buttons and because they love to make people miserable, this is the way they are, and i've never been around anything this bad my son changed years ago my sister's noticed that my friends have noticed it with him. it's just totally like Beijing of the body snatchers you know."
480.0,Provider,What happened during that time that possibly changed them.
7719.0,Patient,"I know what happened and like I said i've always liked his girlfriends and I had been gotten along with her for years and and now she she's very, very volatile. That he teaches 18 year old son and their constant calling the police on him and I went over to for two months, straight after she had the baby, two years ago, every morning and I stayed till afternoon, it was that was hard on me, but I did. And I did everything I could to get along and I still have been doing that. But when they when I told her know that I couldn't watch."
480.0,Provider,The watch.
7719.0,Patient,"The baby for for only four to five hours, this started after my husband passed away, I was so busy and got physically sick my ass and groans. And she actually got mad at me and she basically you can't do anything for me i'm done if I can't do for them, they don't want it, they feel like a bulldozer bulldozing over me that's how I feel. i'm not ready to cry because i'm this hurt me so bad. uh huh. And it was a horse after it got worse after my husband passed away, I was crying out for help for. years with my husband, but they weren't capable of doing it because they don't have it in them to help and I reached out to professionals and everything to it, you know I can understand my husband being the way it was with the problems he had, but this is. This is so dysfunctional you know, and I can't have it in my life and i've come to come to that and. I have to ask the peace and simplicity and this day and age, you don't get it all the time stuff happens. This morning I had insurance company transamerica pulling money out of my account I don't have any life insurance so i've been on the phone this morning with that that kind of stuff like an animal you know. Take care of the House i'm take care, maintenance i'll take care of everything like that, but when it comes to emotional because I love deeply you know people get along with them, and I have friends that know what's going on to. That and they know me. And like I said, this has been a lot to handle with my husband and nail this so but i'm getting there."
480.0,Provider,So when I say i'm tell him basically.
7719.0,Patient,Oh that's so hard.
480.0,Provider,"I know I know I know and so and and I, and I see that in your reaction so one of those options that you have."
7719.0,Patient,"are getting the bubbling up because I can't say anything. Against anything. They you know I can't i've never done it and I know because i've never seen anything or say, well, I wouldn't do that and boy they come on me like you wouldn't believe."
480.0,Provider,uh huh. yeah.
7719.0,Patient,"I believe from them at all he's a great man he lives his life, the way you want, but I have had no respect from him in the last two and a half years so really bad."
480.0,Provider,"So I feel like because you're like why can't tell them and maybe you can't you know, maybe that that is, that is exactly true, but when I say like express to him how you feel not necessarily to him, so you could write a letter. And just you know get it all out."
7719.0,Patient,that's what I need to do.
480.0,Provider,You know.
7719.0,Patient,I didn't want him coming back before I finished her a start and you. start feeling at me.
480.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
7719.0,Patient,So husband did that to me for three years and that wasn't my husband that I knew that i've been with. But that's how it was and now i've got a continuation of it.
480.0,Provider,"yeah yeah so write a letter or an email and just let out everything that you need to say. Because while you're writing it whether you're getting out all your when you're getting out all those things that you need to say. he's not getting it yet so he can't interrupt you, and make you feel bad that's why you can put exactly what it is that you are unhappy with how that makes you feel you know all of those things that you want to say to him, but you never can because he snaps back at you."
7719.0,Patient,"He tells me I don't feel that way you don't feel that way my husband did that to me constantly. Nobody had a call you know, and you don't feel that way because I would cry and tell him. You know the wanting to die, all the time and trying to kill himself and I told him what it was doing to me, and he said you don't. You know, and I don't I don't like the situation you don't feel that way and and deal with it just suck it up and deal with it my husband was not like that, before."
480.0,Provider,So.
7719.0,Patient,"I don't want to alienate my son, either because i'm at least getting to talk to him and knowing how they're doing you know at least once, twice a week um. it's like he feels obligated to call me and I always told him don't ever feel obligated to do anything for me. Because I do not, I don't want that I want to have because he wants to do it, but."
480.0,Provider,"So, and those are all the things that you would express in this letter is everything that you need to say to him that you don't get to say to him. You know, and that way out of you it's getting to the person that's causing you this pain and what he does with it, from that point that's not on you."
7719.0,Patient,"But I want to still hear from once a week I do it, you know just hear from him."
480.0,Provider,I don't think they.
7719.0,Patient,put up with anything just to hear from him.
480.0,Provider,"No, I understand what you're saying. But. I think that if he hears the pain that he causes you. That he's not going to shut you out."
7719.0,Patient,or I hope not.
480.0,Provider,Your his mom.
7719.0,Patient,"Oh, you know I told them that. You know what it is got loud, I mean he's a good person he was really good I don't know what happened really do."
480.0,Provider,"And then, and maybe you say that in your letter to."
7719.0,Patient,I told him that told him that. he's not the same Kurt that I knew and.
480.0,Provider,"But you know you're his mom, but you have the right to your feelings, so when somebody says."
7719.0,Patient,"nanny for everything able to tell anybody, except for my sister and my friends for years so."
480.0,Provider,"Yes, you have the right to your feelings, nobody can decide how you feel."
7719.0,Patient,"You know, I feel that way and I just hold it in is. All I did."
480.0,Provider,"yeah so it's important that you don't hold it embodies that has a really, really negative effect on your mother."
7719.0,Patient,"I understand that that's why I had my sister and my friends during this time to that I could talk with. Because I know if you hold it in you're going to explode and I tell people how I feel I do it diplomatically in nicely and and stuff because I don't want a big Rao you know avoid those, like the plague, and I just didn't the wrong don't know what happened. yeah. Well, I mean i'm not. Perfect everything and I got upset a few times and stuff but and I just I start crying instead of getting really mad you know."
480.0,Provider,On people when they get mad they cry.
7719.0,Patient,"I cry my husband would get on me for that and any get my Facebook follow me into another room and yell at me and then he come in the room and. I stayed in the bedroom a lot unless he needed me and I could listen for him and I was up every two hours checking on them at night. But he come in and my dog is on the bed and hit the came down he got like this in the last few years, but anything that came down on the bed. That was not my husband that I knew but that's what I lived with and like I said i'm oh I there's nothing I can do to change that but I don't I don't want to alienate anybody and that's what i've done all my life I just don't i'd rather get along and. The only thing I have i'm thinking, I was going to ask you if I write a letter, do you think reading it, because I know if I read something I comprehend it and remember it a lot better. than listening to you know something that he would might comprehend that a little better, because I have a hard time when i'm upset putting things across so."
480.0,Provider,"So what one of the things that you can do is You can write your letter and then the next time that we meet in a couple of weeks, we can go over the letter, so you can read it aloud. And so you'll get that it kind of sinks into you Is that really what you want to say once you have the letter, how you want it to be, and just say everything you want to say, and I want to hold back, I mean obviously you know don't be angry don't be rude those kinds of."
7719.0,Patient,Oh no.
480.0,Provider,"You know this is how I feel this is, I believe that you've changed i'm not saying these things, because I don't love you and I don't want you in my life."
7719.0,Patient,"Tell him all the time texting and talking to him I love you very much. i've said that to everybody, I love I tell him that so."
480.0,Provider,"And then you know, make sure you know, I still want to hear from you, you know weekly I still want to have visits with you, I still want to be involved in your life all of those things."
7719.0,Patient,"But I have said this stuff to him before it's just not sticking I told him. you're hearing but you're not listening or whatever vice versa, so I just want."
480.0,Provider,"yep, and so I think that that would be a really good first step is to write that letter take everything that you feel don't hold anything back and put it in the letter. Then we'll go over it in our therapy session and we'll like look at okay to make sure that it comes off the way that you want it to you know expresses how you want to feel and then maybe you. you read it into like a recording or something and send it to him, so that he has like a recording to listen to."
7719.0,Patient,"Like send it doesn't listen real Well he drinks a lot, and he doesn't listen. This started probably every night about four years ago, five years ago uh huh he didn't want to have to deal with it. Stacey he doesn't want to. drink it yeah he doesn't want. it's either my way or no way and that that that's the hard part because i'm very pliable i've got people that are totally opposite my husband was opposite me for years. And I got we got along we have great you know, and I get along with people that don't agree with me and I don't agree with them, but we're still friends and still 25 years 26 year relationships. You know. Go ahead."
480.0,Provider,"So, but that, so the so the reason this letter is it's not so much for him, as it is for you."
7719.0,Patient,it's like a journal journal before.
480.0,Provider,yeah it's kind of it's kind of like a journal it's allowing you to own the feelings that you have. Okay recognize them to own them and then to put them out there now if you choose to send him the letter send him a recording do whatever of what you right that's up to you. Oh buddy air regardless you're putting it out there.
7719.0,Patient,"If you do need to get it out. you're right, I need to get out that's what i've been doing with my sister and my friends."
480.0,Provider,yeah because.
7719.0,Patient,"It actually is getting less and less doing that, with them and actually i've been laughing and stuff at the by the end of everything you know I see it for what it is, I do see it, I just have a hard time there's so much of it it's hard to process it. that's having the problem with."
480.0,Provider,"yep and and that's why it's really important for you to get that out, and like I said, if you choose to send it to him, then then it's on him. So yeah there's there's a circle of control there's the things you can control the things that you can't control and then in the middle, are things that nobody can control like Kobe nobody can control coven it's just there."
7719.0,Patient,"And exactly I accept that. I accept that, but you know something just for my son and like I said Mike my sister said she's like anybody else he's a grown man, and I know that. I don't say vm or anything because i've told him you're grown man, you can live anywhere you want. It comes into my home the way they live in, or you know the way. But like I say I I don't want him to regret anything that's how much love I have for people I don't want him, no matter what happens. I don't want him to have any regrets, because you know I know that, eventually, he may wake up, I won't be here and I don't want him to you know I love him that much you know that I just don't. I don't want them to have any because they had regrets with my husband, they would complain to me about the stuff that he would call them constantly and say stuff and want them to do this and do that every day. And that's why don't ask because my husband did it and I told them i'm not going to ask you to do anything because I saw what he did, and they would I was in the middle and they would come to me and tell me. That what he was doing, and they would yell at me about what he was doing and I said, well, you talk to him about it. I kind of pulled myself out the last year of that but see I try to stay on involved in this stuff as much as I can but like I say the letter I don't know if i'd spend it, I mean I can write a nice letter i'm good at letter writing. And I get very diplomatic and I can do it, but it doesn't take much to set him. off."
480.0,Provider,If he's saying it's your choice whether to send it but it's going to be a really good exercise for you.
7719.0,Patient,To just it.
480.0,Provider,"out all at once, all of these feelings that you have built, you know and it might be too so writing writing letters is a really good thing, even if you write a letter and then you burn it in a fireplace there is a sense of freedom from it. yeah just just from getting that stuff out onto paper it's almost like you admit it to yourself, you recognize it yourself like these are my feelings and they're Okay, and then, even if you don't give it to that person, it still you're recognizing it yourself your."
7719.0,Patient,therapy so.
480.0,Provider,it's very therapeutic because you're saying you know what I feel this way and it's okay it's.
7719.0,Patient,"I know it's okay to feel like I do I do understand that it's okay I just was never allowed to show it or anything. You know I wasn't allowed to play all my life i've had. You know I have been it's hard, especially with somebody who doesn't have my husband never cried he's always you know they want to be tough but you know what i've seen what it does to people. And I can like I say it will destroy you know."
480.0,Provider,"And that's why it's good to write these letters and maybe maybe another letter that you wrote at some point in time is a letter to your husband. he's not gonna be able to read it, because he's not with you anymore, but it's going to allow you to say all the things that you need to say. Because i'm sure there's a lot of hurt there's a lot of pain there's a lot of anger there's a lot of a lot of feelings that are all built up about that you know about him and the last few years, with him, and how much he changed, and you know get them all out and."
7719.0,Patient,help it he could not help it.
480.0,Provider,"yeah and that's and that's fine that, and you can say that to him and say you know I felt this way this way in this way, I know you didn't want me to feel that way, I know that you couldn't help the things you were doing you know."
7719.0,Patient,"didn't make it easier, believe me. I do understand."
480.0,Provider,"yeah so I mean you could write that letter because that's another healing letter you know it's healing for you to be able to express how you feel even if you can't give it to the person that you're expressing it to okay. And then you know as far as your son, you said he drinks a lot when did he start drinking a lot."
7719.0,Patient,"Oh he's always drink it was weekend, you know, on weekends, not every weekend but probably about five years ago, six years ago, and every night he comes home and he drink just stops by the story and tells me and I don't say anything."
480.0,Provider,uh huh.
7719.0,Patient,"And he starts by the store to get beer and stuff and and and even they moved and I they moved close near to me and I don't and they're like 10 minutes away I don't even know where they're at. I mean that's how this is they just made a. couple weeks ago and i've heard you know I get hurt and I got the point where I won't show my feelings, because I tried over the years. And all I did, and every time I cry I get it worse it's like it upset them and they got angry about me crying about how I felt and they got ink my husband did the same thing, but he does this you get if i'm upset it doesn't matter it's how he feels it's an inconvenience on him and that's. me i'm being blunt I would never say that to him, but that's what it is, I choose my words carefully with him, yet, but if I have to keep going like I have been I can do this, you know. Because I am getting stronger i'm not there yet, but I will you know, like I said i'm a lot better off than what I was yeah."
480.0,Provider,"Well, and I think like I said releasing it just getting it out of you is going to help you to get stronger."
7719.0,Patient,"Is poison is what it is, is."
480.0,Provider,"Yes, access to keep all that inside and the other thing too is you know you've spent the last three years, taking care of somebody in their last days as time to take care of you, you know who who are you without your husband."
7719.0,Patient,"yeah I lost myself I killed on to it that's what's coming back now my principles are pretty strong. Within myself. Because i've been seeing as I started feeling useless and stuff because you know just because i've always been busy, and I just helped my friend and stuff out with things I mailed people all the time was stuff what I can do on physically."
480.0,Provider,"It was all about your husband. He were telling them, you were there for him so when now that he's not there you have this void, so now you have a gift of time. You can take art classes, you can."
7719.0,Patient,Already do that yeah i'm very creative so like you and I mean like you can do anything that you.
480.0,Provider,"want you can join a book club, you can go shopping like you have no ties, you get to rediscover yourself and how, how do you want to live the rest of your life."

I have been busy, and you know I have doctor's appointments to know day before thanksgiving. You know yeah I mean, I have a lot to do so yeah."
