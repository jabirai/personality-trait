226.0,Provider,"It Okay, but why do you have anxiety like are you. Like drug addiction is there, drug use is there just depression, anxiety, what is it."
12683.0,Patient,"it's like I started out anxiety, when I was. I noticed September 11. One day of the you know the the Boston bombing building, but my that I knew like I was started shopping short shortness of breath during 2021 after I have a car X. I know I have corrected 2022 years and during that time I just built like really like slowly like I can't breathe every once in a while, again I have. Again, my heart just started hurting me just start writing and I don't know what's wrong with me at that time that's back in like 2001 and then I. Live my my second daughter at that time and then I guess it was built from all this trust my family have forced me to grow up at the age of 12 or early being like you know the. Like taking care of the House together. brother and sister, because the family, my mom and dad will always like. Fighting arguing because of my dad my mom and stuff so. That was, like the big issue at that time, but I didn't realize that was a big issue they didn't get to me at. That time. So, as I get older on my second baby. Can the reason why. My first has a baby Daddy That was the same God is our left and came back and give them a second chance and then. hey I got pregnant with her and I asked him when he left me again and then he called and then. I told him I was praying it and then you say what to and then that's when I just let everything goes like that you know if you're going to think that. That that she's not your baby, then I don't want nothing to do with you, but I think because of that case because, when he left me I was really hard and I was crying every day. Even in the shower even at school, like, I was going to college, I was working I was balancing like dude you know, like multitasking school and work and also like going through stress and stuff like that would like."
226.0,Provider,So um. What okay So what about 911 what what does that say.
12683.0,Patient,"911 when the news came on this one, when I have to slowly thing and then, when I see that 911 you want to see all the news saying like people laws in differently and subsidizes I don't know it just scared mean that's when then. I went home in the evening. Time is so hit me with the panic attack and. That is right now, I know, though, that at that time I didn't know as a panic attack I just knew that I couldn't breathe, that I was dying, so I asked my dad to take me to the doctor because I can't drive and emergency room. And what upset me more is because my dad. I got hit when I was 15 from my dad in the back what dented me the problem that I have with the pain, to this day and and. 2002 cars. The reason why I skipped the story because. that's how it got worse, but then that would make me when I went to the doctor that's the first time that I knew that I have anxiety attack was one as my dad can you take me and he said. No he had to record this. movie so that was kind of upset me they choose. You know, like being at home recording his mood and taking me to the hospital when I can't wait, so I just take the car job myself to the hospital."
226.0,Provider,And then.
12683.0,Patient,They diagnosed me with anxiety problem.

Get scared and I don't do it, I don't know what do it."
226.0,Provider,Okay um. What about do you have any suicidal thoughts have you had any suicidal thoughts.
12683.0,Patient,i'm not gonna lie throughout the whole from. sense. Since my husband passed away. And was alone and stuff. They kind of do. But I always thought about my kit first and I stopped.
226.0,Provider,"Okay, so you've had thoughts, when you were really upset but no plan and no intention. yeah okay so very low low. low risk of suicide Okay, no plan no intention. yeah how did, how did, how did your husband passed when did he pass."
12683.0,Patient,"It does it 2012 unexpectedly throwing up. But a lot of blood and and then he went to the doctor, the next day. And this one I I thought he was Okay, because he didn't want to go to the hospital at nighttime because you bleeding a lot you throw up what blood, not what like. Like you know how people get drawn to draw with food or what liquid and stuff, but it was just it was just blood and chunky and I tell them is too much you gotta go to prosper. And he was just. He never talked to me about any pain anything he doesn't take nomadic and nothing so that's reason why I didn't expect that. It was a bad thing. So I just do what he. asked me to do like what it was was he didn't want to go to the hospital. So I didn't call 911 because it's and then he went back to sleep and then the next day. He got up like normal an APP to go do my routine like my everyday routine hours get out like in the morning to go take you know, like. But that was on the weekend, so I start to go see my grandma's years old, I check the banners and talk for a little bit and then i'll come home and then, when I got inside zoom as melange by. The door and go why you daddy's at the door easily be sleeping like you know around 11am usually be still sleeping or maybe doing like. is like routine, but then it's a. kid told me that. Daddy is. It did you waited but then it says lay there and sleep. And then we did. They didn't know and then I just like oh my God like a wake up and then. He didn't wake up and then I just like job my personal thing and touches pause and stuff and then I got scared and 90 911 and became get in and then. A call his mom and stuff and then we went to the hospital and then they see you know. We waited 10 minutes and then. We got there we way for like 10 minutes. It came in and it so that they. can save him."
226.0,Provider,"What was what happened, why was he what was going on what was."
12683.0,Patient,The autopsy came out. Is that was during my birthday and I came out to be a funeral.
226.0,Provider,So.
12683.0,Patient,"I was gone, I was like not myself for. Like a year. Going back to that it's. kind of sad because it's during my daughter's birthday five years turning five. But instead of a birthday turn to have. To talk to came out so that he threw up like. Like what his liver like messed up. yeah like like. That instead of because, like, I guess, everybody goes through different process I don't know because my mom went through it and. Her said that was different from is. that she passed away for for. Also for years after he passed away."
226.0,Provider,It was here is your husband alcoholic or anything what.
12683.0,Patient,"I find out that his first wife. was first baby mama they never did anything but so they got the ticket with our and she was just. Like cheating on him because cheating on him and stuff and then. Ever since then he just like. drinking and stuff and then I think depression hit him when the economy went down and he was making good money and stuff and then they lay them off they start laying people were making that makes that thing. We all remember the year but they start laying like whoever makes a lot of money, so they can hire new people to start them off. Like low, but like $8. Making like close to 30 bucks already."
226.0,Provider,know.
12683.0,Patient,"And then that was like make him like even like feel like he can't take care of me and the kids so give them like a little depression. But he doesn't talk to me when I asked them what's going on, you know i'm here as a wife to talk to, and I have my sickness, so I need you to be here with me because I don't want you. To map it to you. Tell me until. It happened."
226.0,Provider,Did he ever drink in front of you.
12683.0,Patient,"So I told him if he does have an alcohol problem just don't stop drinking is the oldest with a doctor, because we as girl cuz I have all daughters. We need a man as a father figure to her child. and It didn't stop me because I guess. You probably knew himself that he. Lives he goes through the papers even. Take no listen, but he keep using the alcohol, as is coping. Think that's the reason why."
226.0,Provider,"And so, you said that your mom died of the same thing, so your mom your mom was a drink or two."
12683.0,Patient,"yeah because my dad cheating on how to put it is a light sleeper for good like late late for my first like baby Daddy left, I told them to get out of my. picture like. completely out of my pictures so.
