If I did me time i'm a huge. multitasker top I made it through having twins. I always sell it and i'm getting i'm surprised myself by not really feeling like this, but i've always felt really guilty, if I had. So if I ever had me time before like when I was married, it would be you know the kids would be in bed everybody was fed everything was done, and then I go out my old man stay home, but I go out and. Seeing and you know drink and be stupid. That was my meantime but I in my head it wasn't affecting anything because everybody was in bad."

Then I would go home and make dinner and clean the House and get everything ready, and then I go out and saying.

And she does the whole appointment on facetime. So. yeah so that's what we do with that, but i'm."
726.0,Provider,"i'm really happy to have that support, though, do and and thank thankfully she wants to include you in all of this, you know she's not separating you or or you know pushing you aside or anything."
12722.0,Patient,or in fact she's in fact she's like pulling me in. Like for her I can't see you don't get blob.
726.0,Provider,it's probably better.
12722.0,Patient,"than that oh my God. You know, when you touch your face with your glasses. yeah reason I like doing my hair and I had these of my hand touch. base i'd like. it's like I just took a shower, why is there oil on my face. yeah she she gave me this necklace. She like blocked her mom like her mom it just is she has some issues and she's very she just does nothing but like stress tiana out."
726.0,Provider,either.
12722.0,Patient,"Know that's the whole like. yeah you anyways um this isn't gonna work it looks like weird anyhow she so she. took her mom drinks a lot tiana was put in a foster home because her siblings. because she crashed the car into the canal. yeah. And i'm telling yesterday brian's driving and he reaches down to get the window, because I don't know why my stupid fucking car has the window thing over here, but it does. fancy anyhow. I look up and I see this car stopped, but I don't realize, I thought he saw it, and he came within a foot of hitting that car. And i'm like whoa whoa stop stop stop stop and she will freak out she has like ptsd from that, but the point is there's still two kids in the House. it's a fucked up situation like to live with your grandma grandma's rv she could use you for sure. In her grandma's rv and. Getting disability all this time she's she's been getting disability her whole life. and To. keep all that money and just send her the food stamp card. yeah like."
726.0,Provider,That legal.
12722.0,Patient,Right.
726.0,Provider,And not legal.
12722.0,Patient,"really bad. she's told her you can't ever do anything but you'll never, never be able to take care of yourself, or whatever, and as i'm listening to all of these things i'm realizing that. This is by design. The longer I have you in my life I have this paycheck. He was the payee and we were like Why is she the pain she's like I don't know anything about it, so he called social security, they did a test over the phone and she goes we're going to send you a card you don't need somebody to. yeah she's physically disabled she's. I think she's not delayed. But she's incredibly naive on some things and I think that also is by design I."
726.0,Provider,promise you.
12722.0,Patient,it's horrible.
726.0,Provider,"Sometimes, sometimes for whatever reason, like. Different people different brains it's like sometimes when people go through trauma they they're either super naive or super guarded like. So it might be something that happened in childhood she might not even remember half of the. soul that that she's traumatized by."
12722.0,Patient,"she's remembering but anyway, so we had done this thing where because her sister over here, and this is just like 16. or 15 or something, and we were going to take her because her brother was at her her. aunt's for this summer. and We did it as a work given you a night off thing we were going to go, because we were having conversations with. The aunt and uncle brother without and they were like some shifts going on over there, that is not good. yeah you have like a family meeting so that we could approach. Her with a loving approach, we want to think you need help and we like to help you and, of course, at all wish it sideways because the sister is she see adult in the House, she takes care of everything. Oh no i'm not you're going to decide what am I want doesn't trust people and i'm not doing that and data, all the while acknowledging, while we were there for an hour before he did the ring. Engagement she was in the bathroom with her. Her phone and a glass of. We were like. that's not weird you know. that's a problem if you're going to drink in you have a problem great. But don't try and hide it because that's that makes the whole situation worse, so now and I told channel from beginning Okay, so I want everybody to understand i'm the enemy. And i'm fine with it they're like What do you mean I said she's gonna have to blame and point your finger at somebody and it's gonna be me."
726.0,Provider,Right yeah because you're you're yeah.
12722.0,Patient,"yeah yeah and. Anyway, so a lot of shit went on, but."
726.0,Provider,"You know just be careful to I would say, be careful with that whole situation with that family and. be cautious with them."
12722.0,Patient,"You know she's just she's the whole thing is everybody so guarded because. The situation like her sister. Because of the situation may not be great but it's not foster care. Anyway, anyways so she came to me so she like. blocked her mom and whatever because at this point we've all been like Okay, whatever we get it she's gonna just drinking, you know. let's move on, if she were here if you need help, but whatever right so. She brought me this so she so she's like stressing out why she's pregnant and stuff so she blocks her well and i've been trying to get through to her and tell her look you're you're an adult now you're completely allowed to have emotions. and feelings and opinions and nobody's allowed to tell you, you can't. Because her whole life she's been. In I mean just sucked inward she cried the other day, and she goes because she's pregnant like I don't even know i'm crying i'm sorry i'm like don't ever be sorry, you know in this House crying aloud. I said I want you to get mad I want you to cry I want you feel it's okay to feel it's really good to feel and yeah so she's definitely coming out of her shell. And, and I told her the the situation with your mom is completely on you as far as how this goes you're an adult this is your baby and brian's baby, obviously. The interactions this baby and you and Brian have with your mom it's it's in your court, you have the ball, it will never be passed to your mom, you have the ball. And you make all decisions period, she doesn't have to like it, which can do a damn thing about it so yeah she's like called her mom the other day and she's like yeah or Yesterday, I heard the baby heartbeat the veteran the moms like all that's great and then just started in again about. But I don't understand that and she's like yeah okay I gotta go and she hung up and blocked her again. It literally I could send you up she sent me a letter her mom wrote her or a paragraph. and send it to me were texted a tour, and the first two sentences were like i'm so happy for you, and that it on i'm glad you're you know you're engaged and how you know, whatever and then the entire rest of the letter was like you're just lying and data, and you, you know. You you need to take responsibility for your lies and and I don't know what's wrong with you guys and I was like who does that. Because because she's been caught. The. Only way. It and I told her I said. She doesn't even realize that we're like over it. We see you here's your here's your name tag we know who you are. yeah just understand, we know who you are. that's fine if that's who you are, but we are aware. And you know we've all talked about she's never allowed to have the baby in her car."
726.0,Provider,"she's no not if she's drinking that, for me, I."

I don't know something mother. My. son anyways it's a really sweet little thing but it's a half a heart and she's got the other one that says daughter, and she says, because you're always there for me. I always will be always we've told her from the beginning, if you choose to be somewhere else, and this is not for you, we will not kick you out on the street, we will be sure you go somewhere safe because we care about you.

To be a size zero. But if you think you're five years ago, I was a size zero."
726.0,Provider,"Well, I was. If you're healthy for the most part, and you eat fine I think it's that I think it's like it, which is good, whether you're trying to lose weight or not it's just move your body, every day, even if it's 10 minutes of walking or something. yeah, especially because you have. Chronic pain to sometimes like that, if you're not moving your bodies cannot hurt. it's gonna hurt and if you don't do it every day it's gonna hurt."
12722.0,Patient,"here's the thing and I, I mean this from the bottom of my heart i'm. Literally. I wish I could see this damn thing um. I was in bed for years before you guys. years. I. get up go to the bathroom maybe get something to eat because Paul just takes care of everything, if I didn't if I couldn't cook he wouldn't bought dinner. He didn't care if the House got clean and and I was a checked out mom for a really long time and. This suboxone has saved my life legit. i've only had pneumonia one time since i've been with you guys. wow I had it like 15 times in two years, all through coded I was hospitalized 15 times like the last time I went septic at one point, the last time I was in the hospital for covert or what for pneumonia I was in for eight days. which they don't do right now for anybody you got to be really sick for that. and yeah I was in bad shape and I and a majority of it, she she's just really lucky I didn't sewer. But it's mostly because my my doctor just. See would never give him my meds on the right day in fact I think I told you, I don't know if I did or not she. Literally wrote my like my meds were doing the 29 and it was like 31 days in that month and she wrote it for. She refilled it, but then wrote it for like you know don't fill until the third."
726.0,Provider,On yeah.
12722.0,Patient,But then she went on vacation.
726.0,Provider,I remember you telling me that.
12722.0,Patient,"I was back shit and then I go in and it wouldn't it would be the wrong dose. I you can't call me and tell me. yeah you're taking away my lifeline like. You know I literally need this medicine, because i'm. I can't do anything physically and I am. Everything is worse when I didn't have it, and on top of it, I would be detoxing every month and The thing is, if you have like a condition with your lungs and whatever. anytime you're down a cold or flu you just don't feel like getting up and get around it, it, you will get pneumonia. it's just the way it works and. I was getting it all the time, because I just didn't have the energy detoxing all the time to. bring up the crap in my lungs I don't cough like a normal person, in fact, I have a little machine thing I blow into that it's a you know percussion therapy is. it's basically this. start at the bottom and you bring it up."
726.0,Provider,brings up. yeah.
12722.0,Patient,"It literally does that it's not you don't plug it in it doesn't need batteries. yeah and it's called a flutter valve and there's like a. Something like rubber rubber band material or rubber. And I think there's like a little slice in it, and when you blow into it. yeah you suck in nothing happens you blow into it, it goes. Right, but you feel that in your."
726.0,Provider,lungs yeah.
12722.0,Patient,"it's opening and closing so your lungs are going. like that. yeah saved my life really as. It i'm so grateful for that doctor they came in and said you don't need to be here any longer you've been here eight days you're going to get worse if you're here, but I have an idea. It it was amazing. And I love that because I don't. See it's it's really hard for people to get this but i've had some really shitty experiences with. The medical field. When you're sick for nine years. While you're pregnant I work two jobs six months pregnant. Clean the House get the dishes cook meals. All of it and with twins pregnant with twins. With a hole in my bow that the intestine was looping in and out of and. Looking back on that now I don't know how I did that. Not a clue. But. yeah my life is so different now I i've come to the realization that I deserve better. I am the person that if I need a T shirt. And i've got $20 i'm going to go to the thrift store. i'm very uncomfortable shopping for me. Go ahead."
726.0,Provider,"No, no i'm sorry I interrupted you."
12722.0,Patient,know no you didn't actually.
726.0,Provider,"I was gonna say when the data comes from because it sounds like you. you've done that, for a really long time. He like even what they're your actual spin and and."
12722.0,Patient,"With the canton yeah. yeah I was always from. You know I don't know I mean I think it's. I mean. Some of it, probably because we literally hughes's. lake. lake Elizabeth your magic. magic mountain. Are you oh that's right you're not in California."
726.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
12722.0,Patient,"yeah it's another Disneyland it's a six flags thing anyways um we we lived up in the mountains, for a good long time, and I think it shows you eat hiking and stuff all the time."
726.0,Provider,And I was.
12722.0,Patient,"The forest the middle of the Angeles national forest and. It was a really rich community, like most of the people there. Had unbelievable houses and Nice cars and they went to dance class and guts gymnastics and you know what I mean."
726.0,Provider,yeah.
12722.0,Patient,"And we were the you know, but you have the help that like lives in a House down there to that was."
726.0,Provider,yeah yeah yeah.
12722.0,Patient,"yeah so. I think I always just tried to fit in. and always felt like I just fell a little bit short. and I look back on that now, and I think had like, if I had just if I added to do again I do it all so different I probably still go with my husband and push my way through and save money and just let him think everything was great just to have my kids but. But there's so many things I do different. I mean, I was, I remember distinctly I was assigned seven. Because my mom was like we went to get me a dress. For graduation or something in eighth grade, and they were like oh she's so big and I had giant hits like double d's then and back then you remember, nobody had boots. Like way back before we got gave our kids hormones and everything nobody had. yeah so. I am. I went in and my mom was like the lady was like oh my gosh she's so big that into you know, whatever she's 12. And she goes oh she's a perfect size seven that always just sticks in my head I don't know why. yeah and. If I today is this person went back. I would not feel like oh i'm too fat i'm not pretty enough. it's okay if i'm treated shitty. and grateful to have somebody like me like the people that i'm friends with. Some of them were you know, like really like the really popular girls and whatever because we all there, there was like 1112 people that are graduating class that will tell you anything. Great great. For all of it."
726.0,Provider,yeah I need school.
12722.0,Patient,"There was, I knew me. 100 people from eighth grade kindergarten to eighth grade."
726.0,Provider,wow oh my.
12722.0,Patient,"God it was so small and it's a really small but but you're talking. Leon valley green Valley. lake Elizabeth lake Hughes. And pine Canyon that's all of those in that one school, I mean now i'm sure it's built up and it's you know, a whole different thing. and yeah I mean, I think we just spent a really long time hiding everything, and so it just made me ashamed of who I was. and i'm literally at the point now where like Okay, for instance. Have you got a story for you, where the hell is that thing. Okay. You know what this is it's not a temperature thing it's a zit sucker."
726.0,Provider,Right yeah. i've seen yeah.
12722.0,Patient,yeah i'm going to show you look at the end of my notes. Does the QC it's a bruise.
726.0,Provider,Oh.
12722.0,Patient,"My entire nose and then it bruised right here, and I was."
726.0,Provider,Like Betsy. yeah oh my.
12722.0,Patient,I was like. I mean it's gonna be great for like bug bites or something but. I don't think we're ever going to use that our face maybe. It on their butter their back we're not putting it on her face right.
726.0,Provider,"Oh, my God."
12722.0,Patient,"Right, but I. When I went to lose the weight, I went to one of those. Everything was brand new you know, like they had this thing at the mall I went with my friend, where they take your face and put it on someone else's body in my head that's what I was going to look like and I chose to be some model in a Bikini with big tits and. Beautiful hair and they threw my face on there, and you know what I thought."
726.0,Provider,"Oh, my."
12722.0,Patient,God my nose is so big. I had never looked at my nose really. And I got pretty good size knows i'm it's really no big deal anymore. But when i'm really thin it's you can tell my nose is more predominant.
726.0,Provider,"Oh, I see yeah yeah."
12722.0,Patient,"So it was literally like. i'm going to fix this problem but damn it, it makes that one stick out and i'm pretty sure if I had gotten a nose job, it would have been something else but. I i've been thinking recently. I wonder if. I don't know who I am. I mean, I know i'm a mom. i'm a mom i'm a girlfriend i'm a sister. But I don't know. Trying to avoid coffee. yeah otherwise it does this."
726.0,Provider,"You think you think that these thoughts are coming because, like, I know you mentioned that the beginning of our session you started talking about how tiana doesn't see how beautiful she is. And so it's like almost like you're seeing a part of yourself on with someone else."
12722.0,Patient,"Exactly somebody who's been taken advantage of in some of the same ways that I was. yeah yeah oh I hadn't put that together, but yeah that's exactly it. Okay, for instance, growing up. I was the girl with the boobs. I mean to in seventh grade have. Massive double D boobs who was. You know. And no it didn't make me popular made me the weird kid. and And I had no idea that that was power, and unfortunately it is."
726.0,Provider,Adults treated differently to.
12722.0,Patient,"Oh, I remember, I was telling tiana this, the other day."
726.0,Provider,I was.
12722.0,Patient,"walking down the staircase to the cafeteria with one of the teachers. And I was trying to figure out what exactly she was trying to say because everybody wore those halter dresses. The it was a dress and they had little spaghetti straps. And that was the thing. But I looked way different than that, then all the other kids. And she was trying to tell me. You know I remember her saying you should stand up straight your your. You should be proud of, who you are and I had already. I mean I literally have a white spot right here. Because I have, I always looked down for so long it took me a while to figure out what that was. yeah it's the shadow because I."
726.0,Provider,"Well didn't feel even like do you think that that feeling was high end by just like the history that you have to, because I feel like. If you've already felt like you were used in. In a in a sexual way and then now you have boobs it's like all right, like now it's even more obvious to everybody else, like my. own sexuality we're body."
12722.0,Patient,Probably.
726.0,Provider,cuz that's What was really. Intense feeling.
12722.0,Patient,"to feel that. In him, and then it was fucked up in my head because. Any attention, I did get from guys. I I use that as love. had nothing to do with love. They just wanted to see my tits. So in school and for a good long time I was like mama jokes or you know, whatever they have nicknames for me and. Then. I had a bilateral mastectomy. And the doctor just he was supposed to give me a reduction. This is a bra. I literally have nipples on a chest cavity. I don't know why he gave me nipples just seems stupid like why."
726.0,Provider,yeah.
12722.0,Patient,I don't have any boobs and.
726.0,Provider,You were young and. I was. I was 2023 oh my God that's very young.
12722.0,Patient,"and You know this doctor was like oh you're gonna be fine they're swollen and i'm thinking. yeah if this is swollen what the Fuck have I got. never got like anything done it's just the way it is the way it is, is how it is. And then I was just big lori because I was like three at. And then I lost the weight. and It seems like whatever it's like I don't I look back and my identity. has been. Like stripped from me and I feel like even like as a child. My neighbor. touching on me and. My uncle and my bio dad and you know what I mean I feel like. I didn't have like I think if I had some sort of like, if I had a foundation that gave me an identity as a child. Because I think I was always searching for who I was. And I think if I had a foundation in the beginning, it would have been different. But. The fact that Dave just crushed that foundation from the beginning my bio dad. Like he just destroyed it and said, this is not who you are i'm gonna tell you who you are yeah."

12722.0,Patient,"I don't know. that's a really interesting question I. have no idea who I would have become I think I think i've always I feel like i've always with them all. yeah. My whole thing with curtis you know, have any him so young was this, he was mine was the only thing I had in the world that was just mine, I mean. His dad's too, but you know what I mean. yeah and then there was a little bit of time there was like. A couple years where he had to go live with my mother in law. And we just didn't have our shit together. Which when you're 16 and married and pregnant portion I can average it together. And I look at like tiana now and Brian he's 21 and she's going to be 21 in a couple months and. I see how it must have. Like hey I don't know how I did that, because she has no idea and I had no idea I literally just winged it. Like. I didn't I never had anybody, let me help you and take you know, take the baby, you can take a nap or. You know let's take him to the park let's go here, we should be doing this and have you ever tried, I never even got advice. Like I had no idea if I hadn't babysat I wouldn't know how to change a diaper. And I. We made homemade formula, because we live from the Indian reservation for a little while, and when you live on the reservation, you get commodities I don't know why they were like oh yeah no, you can come get some to Okay, and they gave me this recipe. can't milk. Taro syrup. and water, I think a little bit of water. anyways I mean it was like a supplement with the formula that we normally have. yeah the caramel syrup is can be deadly for children, it has those. yeah it's the same as honey, you know you can't give kids money. yeah yeah. I mean, I could have killed my head it's crazy."

726.0,Provider,"yeah well lori you know, like when let's say you're trying to find like not even find you're just trying to figure out what your identity is apart from other different roles that you play in in other people's lives it's like. If you can come at it in a in a curious like non judgmental way like if you were to write a letter and I don't know why but letters always come up but. You could write a letter to. To lori as a kid lori with the boobs lori. After."
12722.0,Patient,"gastric bypass. Yes, ma'am. skinny lori."
726.0,Provider,These are all like it's still new but. No it's it's it was just like. Think of yourself as different characters in the movie or something you've played roles. So the essence of who is. almost like an actress yeah.
12722.0,Patient,I see what you're saying I just kind of fit in I had to yeah. yeah yeah.
726.0,Provider,"and think of it like I think sometimes people feel like I can't believe I did this, or I did this, or whatever, but it's like no like. All these versions of yourself that you were something it was survival, it was you were trying to survive your environment, you were trying to survive. Where you were living you were trying to survive, all the time, but for you, especially you were trying to survive, from the time you were a kid it's not like after you became an adult you have to learn to survive it's if you had to do it at a really young age."
12722.0,Patient,"It is really weird to me now. To not be in survival mode all the time. To not be like oh my God we need bread, we haven't had bread for a week or whatever I was talking to Paul I really want us i'm seriously i'd love to do it, though. When people go and I know this firsthand. To get. Food from a church or from a charity. By the time they get to that point. they're out of dish soap shampoo laundry soap deodorant toilet paper menstrual pads tampons. essentials things that you need to keep a job things that you need to stay healthy and I feel like it's a giant hole that nobody felt. Right like you're if you're if you're low on money. yeah you're gonna buy milk before you buy toilet paper because you can go get free napkins."
726.0,Provider,going to the bathroom and and probably take the Take it from.
12722.0,Patient,There i've done.
726.0,Provider,i've made.
12722.0,Patient,"i've done that yeah. So i'm the I think it's I think it's a hole in the The thing that. I mean imagine if you have nothing and you're going and you're getting these bags of food it's shit you can't even put together to make a meal and that's a fact it's just random crap that makes no sense. it's basically should nobody wants there's that. And maybe something that isn't everything you need to make a meal just a meal. But. Because it's not that hard. Give them a pound a hamburger and a. thing of macaroni and cheese and a can of milk and. tub of margarine you know what I mean like yeah it's not the healthiest meal, a couple."
726.0,Provider,As a male.
12722.0,Patient,"yeah a couple apples and a can of green beans. um but. But I was telling Paul is that I can't even begin to tell you how many times i've washed the dishes with shampoo. In my lifetime or the laundry. With shampoo because shampoos, that was the cheapest ship, you could buy. i'm not and i'm not alone with this, this is everybody nobody thinks about it, and nobody talks about it but. If you can't take like a full shower and clean yourself properly and keep yourself in your environment, to a certain standard. That mental effects you. and To have to. get to that point where you have to ask somebody for food. Like I. I go every Monday to this place is called the. valley dream Center and they just have all kinds of shit they do, but. They get all the day old stuff from like window and walmart or whatever. Every Monday and they. send me this text and. it's like bread and cakes and donuts and just crap we don't need, but you know it's like Christmas to brandon he's like. there's a whole day."
726.0,Provider,So i've been.
12722.0,Patient,"But they have a lot of like a bag they had like a box of little cranberries in a little bags and they were like take as many as you need, and I was like yes. Through through a bunch of those in the bag, but. I took them I took a bunch of them upstairs we've got. These neighbors that are. In their 30s I believe one of them's as 30 the other ones, probably in his early 30s they are autistic and they rent an apartment together and they have full time. You know, supportive care. 24 seven they've got somebody they're making sure they're not hurting themselves or whatever. yeah to really do really. they're really cute guys there's a sweet as hell. And so, like, I went up there with like a full cake and they were like I said look here first off I know. You guys sit here all day long staff right.
