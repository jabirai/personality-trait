148.0,Provider,morning Susan.
313.0,Patient,"Okay i'm doing this morning actually so i'm really happy about that. I love this two things I need to do and and not drug it what I get to do today, so you know kind of like getting all my Christmas cards together and and then I got special cards for everybody in the family, instead of getting one of those boxes of cards. And each one does something funny you press you know and it's like either the reindeer i'll do a dancer. yeah those. Those kind, the one thing missed out on is the hallmark card it's maybe it's not Homer but they open up and once the Charlie Brown and it's like when you open up there singing that song, you know, like. Christmas. You know, and then they all like join it's like mailed burst out in this card and they seem that Christmas song okay. Yes, of course, they were sold out and and well, then one car on display that was left but they said we'll try to get it online or something. No luck, but. Anyway, so missing the other ones are really cute what they do you know so i'm happy about that. yeah so um I just have been doing a little bit around here every day, not overdoing it. Right and I need to get a storage unit that I have cleaned out because it's costing me too much money, and so I would kind of in bringing a few boxes back at a time to go through so don't get over and welcomed by but I, I have a collection of DVD DVD BLU rays movie. props and and movie I guess paraphernalia whatever you want to call it, you know all the stuff that. That sometimes they put out as special. promotions for like I have a thing of box this big. This big. And it has the alien creatures from the alien movies. For all of them, the likes it shows how it transpired into what it is today, but the sculptures and then it, it has every l alien movie in BLU Ray that they've ever made and it's like intact and but more than that, I have so much star trek stuff so. i'm going to be trying to. i'm not sure if i'm going to use. eBay or something like that to sell a lot of the things that I have some of them yeah I want to let go of and then there's some that I don't want to let go of but. I have so many autographed photos from the cast of different movies so i've been trying to get some of those all together y'all are like deep space nine and and Voyager and enterprise me name it. So I can sell it as like one package thing and then I do have. My my husband passed away from cancer in 2015 we had gone in 2007 to a. star trek convention that should have been held in sacramento but they changed it to San Francisco and. They have an auction at the end of the Convention, like on the last day and they have some star trek stuff that's all signed and stuff. So they let you go out there and take a look at it and see what you might want to bid for and both my husband and I looked at it same time and knew we wanted to go for. star trek original cast picture it's like this, like this and it's signed by every single one of the star trek casts and at that time games you hand, please scotty. had passed away and forced to Kelly, who played the doctor and passed away, and I think that was it at the time just those two characters because check off in and yeah it's just those two characters so which made it a little more valuable, but as they pass on. It even becomes more valuable, but. He bid on it, and I was like cringing Burt for 30 $100. And it had a frame on it, but it wasn't like really nice, so I had gotten previously been signed and had some of them Aaron brothers, you know do manning and custom framing and they have really good people over there, that can. Be I mean just the stuff that they come up with is fantastic you know i've learned a lot so i'm trying to. match matt in frame my own pictures, because you save a lot of money. It costs like 300 plus to have one framed and and but they're the one place, did I do trust having a picture like that, with you know, because you need that there for them. And when you pay that much money for something you know it's like you don't want it to disappear, you know how somebody decides, they want to take it home so. So um but it's kind of overwhelming because the I mean my husband every Tuesday, he would go and get. Whatever was coming out, you know from the theaters to. BLU Ray or DVD. And you know at bestbuy so every Tuesday go down there by two or three different thing. Needless to say, we have a huge collection of BLU rays and DVDs and it's so overwhelming of box after box after box and their stuff full of fun so i've been trying to separate stuff that a library, you know, like we have documentaries and things about. lake tahoe and educational things, and then we have. You know all the. star trek's the different ones, and I didn't realize this by going through the boxes, he has like two or three copies. Of BLU ray of star trek the original series which is three episode three on season he's got bought over like three different times so we've got trekkies in a family, so I have been putting those aside to wrap as Christmas presents for my niece's. I mean be so they haven't even opened. So um I have this big box that i'm putting everything into, you know as Christmas gifts that they know that they're interested in and I had done this. A few years back, the same thing, except for I brought a huge box and let them go through it, you know. But this time i'm just gonna say Okay, I know this person like this, and this person would like this and and just kind of do it that way, and then i'll bring a box and say okay guys can pick from wherever else you want. So it's it's crazy thanksgiving was. Interesting or house and we had. James and I and then he invited his friend and his daughter, we had them and then another friend of his and his son, so there were eight of us here Turkey turned out great. Everything turned out perfect do it, you know I managed to get the House cleaned up after I got you know, like the Turkey in the oven, and all that and we had all the. Everything because. There was an incident during my boyfriend and my brother in law. I guess thanksgiving a couple years ago. and It almost turned into a fight. And because my brother in law said something like get the F and the way my dad and him unknowingly were standing in front of the TV when football was playing and he had a bet on the game, and he wanted to see, and he said back to. James my boyfriend and my dad my dad didn't hear it, because he started hearing. And so, James immediately said hey yeah yeah talk like that yeah and just ask us through you don't need that language, and then it just heat up I didn't see the whole thing next thing I know you know it's like. James is very go after and he's about ready to go after Jane, and so they went outside, and so I immediately went out there. And so they both sat there and I said hey look guys, you need to you know who off yeah I don't know what was said, or who said what but that's something we handle here. And so, ever since then they don't want to be in the presence of him, this is my second oldest sister's has been and so it's like. They don't. they're just being. yeah they're taking my my my sister side you know about what happened, and all that stuff and so. My dad had his 80th birthday and we were all there and they were there, and there were no problems they sat at another table. yeah but for thanksgiving you know I couldn't spend we couldn't spend thanksgiving with them, because they didn't know if cheryl and Xavier were going to be there. And then I call them to wish them a happy thanksgiving and they're not there, and so I know exactly what happened and it hurt my failing and um. And you know. it's just like. This is my sister okay that's living with my dad this is her. coming through to my dad about what she's saying about about him right my dad said that well if you make your bed, you have to sleep in it only my sister would say something like that. about not having it with the family, you know because they don't like him because of that they don't know him like I know him. And so it's causing a rift my dad just turned 85 James talks to my dad you know my dad talks to James they're very open and what they talk about you know and it's like it's my sister my sister retired she moved in with my dad she's supposedly supposed to beginning our own place. So, every time I try to go over to my dad she's in the middle of our business where she doesn't belong. I mean. I took care of all of my business for when I die she's not mentioned in one place in my whole well. I mean that's would be she is now her two kids are okay my two nephews are but um as for her yeah I didn't make her an executor or anything. and You know it's like. She just yeah it's. there's a long thing between her and I we've never read on anything you know and it's her way or no way that's how she is you know she thinks that she's god's green earth now and that she can walk on water, she doesn't believe in God yeah. I don't know how she get them without having something to believe in yeah I just can't see it. I can only say she must be miserable i'm me she was married once have one child, they adopted his the nephew nephew because you've been bounced bounced from family never found members and they took the man and he's in my well you know cuz. You know here's like two or three when she gone and so all the grandkids are going to be taken care of. And I always go out and get them nap now, I have to just write out the sheet of like special things like my jewelry and stuff like that, and just going to get it, and all that stuff so. I I take him my my excuse me dropped my pen I took my. wedding from my first marriage and I gave it to my nephew for his fiance because they've been you know beyond a forever and you can really he had gotten or something that it was like tiny, and so I gave him that ring and and told them he could have that that was his early inherit. So um they really didn't do a whole lot to it, like the same setting and everything, but he got that so. You know, he was happy about that so but. yeah it's it's crazy yeah I. And I understand, for me, growing up, I was always very much. I worked hard at school, I did really good school and I worked hard at work in worked really hard at work. and not be able to work after all these years it's been difficult, but. When I can't function or do what I normally do because they get. I guess so involved with or wanting it to be perfect that it just. drains me nuts, but I had hurt myself on the job. and I was a customer, excuse me customer service REP for all the wine and food or eat food accounts here in San Joaquin Valley, so I had all the wineries I had all of the food processing places Valley. I can remember the name anymore. But. It it was a crazy job, a crazy crazy job and. So I ended up throwing it back out when I had asked the warehouse guys to move. Some file cabinets and like it was like it slowed down and in the shipments have all been out and everything's know out and nothing happened so finally late in the afternoon. I decided to dry it and I I drive I drive it, but then there were some computer chords on the floor lifted it up and I felt my dad, though. So I told my boss, and so I managed to finish day went home got up in the morning could move. So. I turned out that I ruptured death. and And so it was just downhill from there."
