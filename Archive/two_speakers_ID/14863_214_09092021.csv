14863.0,Patient,"Well me and my husband well we're separated he's in prison but we've been separated for eight years um. It started when he came home and well actually before that even I messed with pills so. It really started back when I was like 10 and I did heroin or not heroin I smoked weed for the first time, when I was like nine or 10. And then, after that. I I didn't really do it all the time or per se but. The pills really started i'm trying to remember like how i'm 31. I want to say, like 13 or 14 eight I defend dived in and I got my first prescription for percocet because I had a knee injury. They were prescribed back then, and then, when I 17 like I stayed dry for a little bit you know I drink here and there, but it was never like an addiction per site for me.

14863.0,Patient,"I understand this, I know how it goes okay fair enough."
214.0,Provider,"So, have you ever been treated for mental health."
14863.0,Patient,"Not necessarily I i've been outpatient programs i've got to counselors. Like as far as a site Dr guys like i've i've discussed some of my issues, but like now as an adult I realized more kind of what they are. Okay we're saying."
214.0,Provider,Enough so when you said you were in outpatient and sing concerts was that for substance abuse.
14863.0,Patient,"yeah it was a substance abuse program for the hero, and when I was 17 I stopped abruptly because I got in trouble with the law. I went to juvenile jail was on house arrest and went to drug court I graduated and I stayed really dry after that, for five years, I didn't drink I didn't catch anything any smoke."
214.0,Provider,"that's great. So you know what sobriety is, this is not okay."
14863.0,Patient,I do.
214.0,Provider,Well that's a good thing. yeah all right. I will get back to the mental health in a minute any suicide ideation. know any homicide ideation. know any cell phone. What was it like growing up as a child in your family.
14863.0,Patient,"I would say, I had a pretty happy childhood I didn't tell my parents got divorced, have always been like a daddy's girl. And I had to move with my mom i'm a lot of resentment towards her for that. And like I mean. You know now like I said now as an adult I kind of realized more what was happening, but I still have some kind of like triggers from that like you know with the way she has she has mental health issues herself that she did she won't address. Occasionally, I have, I like I call it, they call me Dr Brown. Okay. You know i'll i'll get i'll get her down, and you know, like set her down and she'll come out with that, but."
214.0,Provider,"Did you. What did you feel before the divorce, that I want to cut you off, I just want to stick with this one sentence. Did you feel before. The support. You said happy childhood until."
14863.0,Patient,"I know, in retrospect, like they would be fighting I kind of wanted them to get worse, but I just did it what i'm going."
214.0,Provider,To get it.
14863.0,Patient,started probably about 889 that's when I started smoking.
214.0,Provider,"Okay that's great now you alluded to something else the next question really is, do you have any siblings."
14863.0,Patient,hey do I have three or four brothers actually.
214.0,Provider,how's your relationship with them.
14863.0,Patient,"Well, like two older brothers were kind of already grown there from my dad's previous marriage. I have good relationships with all my brothers right now. i've had issues with some of them due to my addiction."
214.0,Provider,"what's your relationship like, with your parents."
14863.0,Patient,"And we're good relationship like I i've always had a good relationship with my dad. he's supportive of my recovery and all the eighth notes everything like I kind of lay it out for him. And my mom not so much just. starting to try, though."
214.0,Provider,"The next question is about, and you did like touch on it briefly was do you think anybody in your home life struggled aunts uncles mom dad with."
14863.0,Patient,"yeah my lawn for sure. my brother has a shoe. On my mom's Heinrich and when it's kind of like she grew up like really strict Christian you know she it's kind of like taboo to talk about with with my mom's side of the family and my brother actually grew up with one my mom so my dad took me at age 10 because I was acting out. My mom kept my brother, though."
214.0,Provider,I can see some of the resentment there.
14863.0,Patient,yeah for sure.
214.0,Provider,"yeah I, and I understand that okay. yeah do you think you have any other addictive behaviors I understand where we're trying to get control of this one, but do you think like if you can't get pills you lean into something else."
14863.0,Patient,I Apps like absolutely I mean at this point like I feel like I need something to get through my day.
214.0,Provider,got it. And what would.
14863.0,Patient,The suboxone.
214.0,Provider,"But, but that, but that is a medically assisted treatment right, that is. high blood pressure, it is like. Diabetes it's medication okay."
14863.0,Patient,"exactly like a lot of people don't understand. That, of course."
214.0,Provider,"I think I think there's a little bit of bias going on. and yeah ignorance on top exactly. I agree, so what was school like for you, six, seven, eighth grade."
14863.0,Patient,"Well, I I felt eighth grade and then six seventh and eighth I went to middle school, you know, I was kind of like. I had my husband and I kind of like I don't know, I was pretty happy. You know I I was, I was a stoner for sure."
214.0,Provider,But how was.
14863.0,Patient,"I felt eighth grade up until then it was probably like I was honor all like, and then in ninth grade I had straight a's and then I did penn foster which is like online high school and I graduated when I was 15."
214.0,Provider,whoa check you out. yeah that's a great accomplishment don't minimize that.

214.0,Provider,"When you think about it's a little bit of the codependency and the other thing. Exactly exactly you're thinking more about. How he may respond to a versus, what are the benefits for you."
14863.0,Patient,"Before and I gave him a space and. He still you know he's back in there, I just if i'm going to pursue that anytime you get all and space to be maintained and I need to see improvement like i'm not going to re engage in that until I see that."
214.0,Provider,"And and that's a good boundary right no people, please. And that's a fair boundary it's not like well if you can't become a lawyer, I don't want to be with you i'm just."

Just completely ignoring her like I have in the past, like typically I will not happen, I leave for a couple months and I go to one of my friends houses."
214.0,Provider,"I mean it's okay to take a vacation it's probably healthier than trying to figure it out. I can't really change the situation, so I should take my. son had this situation yeah yeah I see you're on abilify. What do you want abilify for."
14863.0,Patient,"Well, he that my my previous doctor i've been having trouble getting the doctors and stuff because I don't drive so i'm working on that, though I have my permission, not to go again I just need my marriage license which has been really difficult to obtain."
214.0,Provider,"But, but what is the medication for what is it."

14863.0,Patient,Harmful exactly. Actual yeah that's real. That not it's true.
214.0,Provider,it's okay and and if if something. And it stopping you it's assisting you from stopping to use pills.

214.0,Provider,I support that that's fine. How about mental dad's opinions any you on any bundles.
14863.0,Patient,"I am not think. I like Okay, so at the beginning, your eyes really addicted to those I almost died last year from it, and like. It was just a really scary experience coming off of I will never touch them again."
214.0,Provider,"yeah but it's a bad one to be on i'll be. It serves a purpose, the problem is getting off of it, and no one really discusses. So the background between the banjo is only supposed to be between six and eight months people on it is and then doctors are like you know this isn't good for you like what you mean it's not good for me, what do you mean I got to get off of it it's a very addictive. physically addictive medication."
14863.0,Patient,yeah it's I feel like the benefits aren't there to the side effects. that's correct I. I wrote down those myself back in February and I haven't touched themselves and i'm not. Like I just don't want nothing to do with it.
214.0,Provider,What was the revolt the license about.
14863.0,Patient,I just did it have insurance. it's been four years i'm. sure.
214.0,Provider,"Okay, so I see this now, I want to go to another part real quick. And look at what is happening here Okay, let me just sign in. I don't need that. We are all. I don't even know who your prescribers and i'm pitching I know you prescribe. I knew it Malik. And I tell you why cuz I know his patterns. I know I know what he's trying to do for someone I could just tell, by the way he writes good how's the position working."
14863.0,Patient,"Oh it's awesome i'm actually going to be out of everything tomorrow, so I don't know he's only been prescribing me a couple of days at a time."
214.0,Provider,I hold on so i'm gonna let him know. Okay refill scripts.
14863.0,Patient,"He gave me this a box last time he just he only gave me seven days of the position but it it's awesome like I don't fall asleep right away, I feel like maybe I may need a little bit stronger strength, but it is helping crusher."

14863.0,Patient,"Okay, so, as I say, I have a question about that, because so i've been told, two different things, and I was concerned that I don't want to be noncompliant so are they going to send those in the mail and I do that."
214.0,Provider,"So I am going to take care of that it's on the recording that we're addressing it, I will follow up so you don't. be the one that it falls on i'm going to do some more and i'll be able to give you a better answer on Monday, within that the doctor is going to want you to go for an initial lab work and. they'll do it they'll draw it from there and then from there on they'll send it to your home."
14863.0,Patient,"I know I know I know I need to do bloodwork which i'm going to do, Monday."
214.0,Provider,"Okay, so this is good that's going to be the initial exam so you haven't done surveys yet."

214.0,Provider,"Right, so my belief is, I think we all do best when we keep the same days and same times like we have."
14863.0,Patient,This routine.
214.0,Provider,"yeah cuz if I say 831 day 10 o'clock another day. Tuesday same work, and I try to keep all the people I work with in a real good system."
14863.0,Patient,Oh absolutely.
214.0,Provider,"Okay, great. you're welcome, so I am going to now put this in your chart and Dr Malik will see that you're doing what you need to do. Which it's important for him to know that you're being responsible so. We said the 16 we're both in the same time zone."
14863.0,Patient,Okay.
214.0,Provider,"Okay, so, then any questions, for me, before we leave."
14863.0,Patient,So you do the meetings.
214.0,Provider,I still have to them.
14863.0,Patient,that's awesome okay cool if there was one or not.
214.0,Provider,"Or how that went yeah So what will happen is it depends, I mean. Right, how does quite a big organization and I run I am. I am a full time therapist for by heart, as well as a facilitator some good facilitate some of the people in there are not my people I work with, but for the majority of the part the groups that my people are in i'm also the therapist so. that's a lot of. similarities between. A philosophy."
14863.0,Patient,I think routine and inconsistency is very important.
214.0,Provider,"It will be because you know I the way I make my meatloaf may not necessarily be another therapist is. True. And then it's like I don't know what is he telling me what is she telling me, am I getting this message I kind of like this message better and then it tells it tells away from what we're trying to work on as a team."
14863.0,Patient,Monday at 9am.
214.0,Provider,"yep and then Thursday at 1030. gotcha all right listen, it was a pleasure Ashley and I look forward to working with you."
