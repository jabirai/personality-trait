148.0,Provider,hi Emily. how's it going.
383.0,Patient,"Well um. it's going OK and mean you heard a little bit about what's going on with me group, and she. had one second. Hello. That was a doctor's appointment. So um. yeah it's pretty heavy um I. You know not only i've got my own health issues that i'm having and. My mom it mean that was strange because I was actually saying to her, you know. right before this I was saying to her. So I don't have my key things. Debt that me and my brother and she should really have a talk about. about what you know about her getting older, what she's always been very. Very secretive about. You know how much money, she is about her her lie, you know she's she's a she's had a tendency to always want to. keep things very private from me and him and all that and I was saying, you know, we need to start you know you're getting a lot older, we need to start talking about making plans or start talking about what's going to happen. And she was saying why don't you know pre like i'm you know she was saying we have plenty of time for that and then right after that all of a sudden, she started feeling shorter breath and then. turned out, she had her one of her lungs. collapsed, and she. Has a lesion on a lung. And now the doctor, you know she's signing up with hospice now. The doctor was saying that he thought it, you know his guests was about six months we I still you know we still think it's going to be longer than that because sometimes she seen me really you know pretty healthy. But she has to be on oxygen all the time, pretty much now and it's getting that she can leave the House last and last and. So."
148.0,Provider,Pretty sudden.
383.0,Patient,"It yeah yeah. yeah, even though I mean she's 85 and sort of you know. She has a friend it's 95 and is running around doing all kinds of stuff you know, so you know. But she's taking it well she's actually she likes the idea of not having to link, you know because she started to lose a lot of our memory. And she's been really scared that she would lingo you know hang around for a long time and are really out of it state and so she seems to be pretty open to the idea that. Going past but anyway, but now you know there's a scramble of trying to you know she's doing these powers of attorney for me and my brother and working out different stuff and you know but but her. Her my you know she was an attorney and she's always been really, really smart really smart really intellectual and really smart really on top of everything so she's struggling with the fact that she can't. That keeps forgetting everything losing against can't keep stuff in her mind and brain or you know and. So that's hard, and you know i'm having to do everything for her now and but you know also we have always been really, really close and especially. Since I became sober you know i'm you know she's we have our living together and she's my main companion and and so you know what i'm gonna do where i'm going to go, you know when she passes, I know we're gonna have to sell this House so well. And it's not like there's a you know there'll be the money from the House but there's not a ton of money and I don't know money on my own, but I will have to get off the social security. So I mean there's just a lot of stress and I find it weird I have these dreams. Almost every night I have this dream, where i'm in this situation and i'm trying to call it like it like it involves i'm trying to get in touch with her like i'm trying to call my mom. And I need to call my mom in the phone does it work and I can't get through, I can't get in touch with which to me symbolizes like her, passing and me not being able to to reach her anymore. You know it's and and these dreams. Almost every night where i'm trying desperately to get in touch with my mom and I can't you know. So. You know and and also, I like I really because I need to be. Practical and helpful and also I can't just break down I I really compartmentalize my emotional part of it from. The day to day, you know so i'll be fine and then all of a sudden have i'm not you know I just find myself i'll break down and i'll start feeling really scared and really anxious and crying and you know. But, but in a lot of ways I I i'm. Trying to stay detached from my emotional you know, for now it's going to hit me emotionally. And so yeah. And i'm always known that you know losing my one movie the hardest thing i'll ever have to go through, I mean we've you know we've been best friends she's you know very close my whole life. So it's it's really it's scary."
148.0,Provider,yeah and it's scary and it's painful. yeah makes a lot of sense why you would want to detach from from something that is so pain from such a.
383.0,Patient,Huge right.
148.0,Provider,Emily has this brought up any triggers or cravings for you.
383.0,Patient,"well. I know that I said I mean not you know i'm i'm very secure in my recovery, and I have very resolute but. What I have found you know, is it doesn't necessarily manifesting cravings exactly, but the one you know the feeling of wanting to escape. You know um and feeling sort of. At loose ends. And I don't I it's not like I think about using or a cooler I feel like I really need to get high or anything like that it's not like that it's just the feel the the feeling of being uncomfortable in my own skin. and You know, so you know and and again i'm you know all these fantasies i've had about you know. Developing more getting more going in my life, you know seems more urgent now. At the same time i'm i'm preoccupied I mean i'm i'm having to you know. Be here take care of my mom and talking to my brother and all that I I. And then. And then struggling on my own health."
148.0,Provider,You know so like.
383.0,Patient,"You know I think about wanting to go to the ymca and. and signing up you know and getting into some fitness thing there's so many days, where I feel so lousy not sleeping well, and you know i'm having all this cramp cramping in my head, you know i'm doing all of that, where I just don't feel good enough to go and do that. it's just a real struggle."
148.0,Provider,"And weighing on you yeah. yeah just around the piece. Where you're figuring out your. The circumstances and the logistics of everything I feel like it's really important to. Take that one, at a time, because if you look at everything as a whole, it can feel really overwhelming and stressful. yeah like the biggest thing to manage here is. The stress because stress can be a huge warning sign that could lead to other things if it becomes too. Too intense right. Right um I also just want to encourage you just you know, with everything that you've talked about to just slow down in the moment and enjoy last moments that you have with your mother. so important. tip you're going to treasure these last moments forever. Right and go through your grieving process it'll just knowing that you were there with her. And for her right. hoarding her to the very end is so huge."
383.0,Patient,"yeah yeah I mean that was a big part of the reason that I wanted to come back here. and live with her originally you know when I decided to you know when I was deciding when I got clean where to go and we put this garage into an apartment because I knew, she was getting older and I knew the time was going to be limited and I wanted. To spend that time with her, but at same time you know reconnecting, to the extent that we have makes makes it that much harder at the same time, but yeah yeah."
148.0,Provider,"yeah and then thing that I just think it's so special the way that you pre connected with her, and this bond that you've shared with her."
383.0,Patient,yeah i've gotten her you know she trusts me and what I mean that is. means so much that you know she trusts me 100% now you know I feel like i'm feel like i'm worthy of that trust and.
148.0,Provider,"Absolutely, it really is so beautiful yeah yeah. So I do encourage you, you know. Maybe make a list of what's really important to take a look at and just look at one, at a time, instead of looking at everything, because these are big things that you're talking about selling the. World moving somewhere new right. really big things and. that's enough to just take you out right. If you're now all around it yeah."
383.0,Patient,"yeah yeah and you know, and you know, and I, I do have enough experience with this that I, I really do you know i'm not. A lot i'm not i'm determined not to allow myself to be blindsided you know because i've had some sobriety and relapse in the past, and I know how that can happen so i've always moyes really always keep. You know check in with myself a lot, as far as that's concerned."
148.0,Provider,"yeah yeah yeah there's definitely one thing that i've never heard in you and that's overconfidence because. yeah covenants can absolutely lead to relapse so. right here that I do hear that you're very. Careful. Right you're right careful in your recovery and. you're very aware, which is huge. I do think it's a little concerning. To try and shut off the emotions. Right, because while they are very uncomfortable they are. Very important to feel, because what tends to happen is we push and push and push down and suppress the emotions and and like to the point where we can't push down any further and more feel. Like everything at once, which is."
383.0,Patient,goes up. yeah yeah.
148.0,Provider,"So um. You know in between our sessions, if you feel like hey I could really talk to somebody today just called virtual clinic and asked to set something up with me."
383.0,Patient,"yeah um and. instantly I had asked pastor to prescribe me something for sleep, and I think he prescribed me trials and I didn't mention that I have had bad experiences with crowds about. Okay, I get a. Night paralysis. Where i'm having a horrible dream and I went I can't I. can't I can't move I can't. yeah wait, I know i'm awake but. I can't move my body is really freaky. yeah and then he also mentioned that I should be. Getting touch with and my son said that I should maybe see a psychiatrist i've been on. lexapro forever, but I don't feel like it doesn't a very much good."
148.0,Provider,Standing setting something up with a mental health provider through.
383.0,Patient,I think that's a good I think it's a good idea i'd look at i'd like to look at because you know depression is been an issue and it definitely is an issue for me now.
148.0,Provider,"Okay, what i'm going to do Emily is i'm going to put in an inquiry for you, for someone to reach out to you to get that scheduled. Okay um talk to your sake about. what's going on with their sleep, too, or you just because I don't know how soon you'll get in with somebody and hopefully it won't take long but."
