So i'm going to ask you questions we're going to start off with demographics i'll get like your name. occupation, all kinds of history from there we'll go over your history of substance use will go over your physical health. many kinds of conditions that you might have been diagnosed with still ongoing surgery stuff that matter will cover mental health concerns if you have diagnose currently and treatments stuff of that nature and then we'll go over some environmental factors. And then. i'm pretty much rapid with that so not super Labor intensive. I try to be. Pretty concise with this stuff so really it depends on. The duration really depends on like how deep dive you want to get on some of the responses. I always tell people this isn't like a therapy session because i'm going to ask you, like a lot of questions you might feel compelled to like really unpack the onion but that's not what we're here to do today. we're just try to approximate as much information as you can so dates and times we don't need the exact date or time some people will be like yeah it was July 16 and it was raining that day and the sun was like I don't need any that stuff I just need like. A prospect so. clear and concise, so we can keep it moving, because we could be here for hours. So you have any questions or concerns or anything like that.
