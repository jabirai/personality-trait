15542.0,Patient,"i'm. Not looking forward to today i'm a lot, but not looking for."
121.0,Provider,Your sister coming over.
15542.0,Patient,"And at first, I was like oh i'm probably just like future tripping like predicting the future like you know so did the thing I remember his group, it was like oh what's the most likely outcome. So I was thinking about it, like in the past um. and It was like whoa like this is the most likely outcome. which was disappointing."
121.0,Provider,"Okay well caught up let's play it all the way through, so what is most likely outcome."
15542.0,Patient,she's gonna get mad over nothing in your mouth.
121.0,Provider,"And then, what."
15542.0,Patient,And then pursue my dad are going to fight and it's just going to be really awkward intense.
121.0,Provider,"And then, what."
15542.0,Patient,"And then i'm just going to like my dad is going to be really upset so i'll have that. and my sister will be like. Mad at me, I guess, I don't know. it's just it's like it's really awful and awkward and like. Those to get going at it was like. The final straw that broke the camel's back before I tried to overdose and it's just like I don't. I don't want. To be a part of this."
121.0,Provider,"I don't think you have to be. And I think you can also set the boundary of and you don't even have to tell them this but for yourself of if they do start fighting you leave. You don't have to stay there, and be part."
15542.0,Patient,it's true.
121.0,Provider,And you know. If your dad gets irritable and stuff. what's the worst it's going to happen with that it's going to be an unpleasant there to. or your first one.
15542.0,Patient,by Stephen somewhere to go before the back again.
121.0,Provider,"hold on sorry, you were frozen Thomas what is it."
15542.0,Patient,"yeah it's it's unstable I don't know why but um. So I have, like all my college stuff. And so it's like I need a place for it to go, because I had my stuff here and I needed like a bunch of stuff at college that I don't eat here because it's like a fully furnished house um. And so, at first, I had been storing it in like the extra bedroom downstairs and then my uncle came to visit my dad was like I need to get that stuff out. Whatever that's fine, so I put it in my sister's room because of work like what were the two rooms in the House, knowing us. And last night or last week you've been looking to get stuff out of them like Okay, I will really not been looking forward, because I don't like caring about heavy boxes up and down the stairs. Oh, like we have the downstairs where i'm like he had a bunch of stuff in there, and he was like somehow frustrated with me that he got stuck in there he's like need to get yourself out of it is like so that's online and I guess i'm. i'm. So, last night I was reading this stuff and I just a little bit frustrated, I was very frustrated, partly because I was really Dreading whatever was going to happen, and partly because, like my body was just hurting and it was a big project I didn't want to do again. Those frustrating and. He says something like. I don't remember oh OK, so he was working in the so. right by the stairs going from my sister's room to the cluster term there's like a table and the table he's like look at except one wrapping presents. Like in kid like are you kidding me how you want me to walk down the stairs turn heavy boxes and being careful not to look there, that is a guarantee way for me to like fall and get really hurt besides you've been like pitching me about this for a week now i'm doing it. Why are you trying to make it more complicated, and he was like when you let them understand why you're upset and like I feel like i'm not supposed to exist here if I don't have a good place for my stuff to go. My body was really hurting at that point then express it well, but. He like katie you're being irrational and I said i'm not i'm not doing this and I left. chuck said don't."
121.0,Provider,You say that was last night. Can we talk to him today.
15542.0,Patient,No. Last night because. I realized like I felt bad for him he's so stressed about this and. He wants her to like. Stay sure I wouldn't do it here last night. But should keep break. she's convinced that if he does everything 100% right she'll stay. there's no way in hell she's been. I know her she's she's really good at baking problems and she wants to pick a couple. inches. it's. it's frustrating that I have no control over this that she's going to do what she's going to do and it's like I just have to deal with.
121.0,Provider,What. We have control over them.
15542.0,Patient,If I stay.
121.0,Provider,What else.
15542.0,Patient,"is how I engage with them, let me. I think you want me to say, like extent to which it affects me."
121.0,Provider,"There was no supposed to. um the extent to which it affects you emotionally, you have some control over you definitely have control over how you react to that."
15542.0,Patient,yeah that's true. Also frustrated that like. i'm taking changing society about it. Because like everything's been taken out on me. Community. yeah.
121.0,Provider,We told him that.
15542.0,Patient,"i'm. know. It just it doesn't feel like the right time, when these are distressed about this other thing and."
121.0,Provider,I think you can still say it really feels like you're taking your stress out on me right now.
15542.0,Patient,You. Know certain handle criticism very well.
121.0,Provider,yeah I picked up haha.
15542.0,Patient,And I just i'm I don't. want to take that out first you know I got other things happening.
121.0,Provider,But you also don't deserve to get treated poorly because he stressed out.
15542.0,Patient,yeah.
121.0,Provider,"So you have every right to ask him not to treat you better. yeah and I think you can phrase it up, I know that you're you're stressed you've got a lot going on right now and it feels like i'm getting kind of the brunt of that. You mind just being a little bit more mindful of that. That you still have a right to stand up for yourself and state what you deserve and Mina. And you're worthy of doing."
15542.0,Patient,So weird because. We heard about this last night at. Berkeley. I feel the same I am worthy of. Protecting like Aaron for. And at the same time. i'm. Protecting myself from the fallout of seeing not for myself. And this is. honestly. He and I think. it's getting frustrating because it feels very like. i'm very anxious whenever he's around every time for me to do something and make. an army struggling with feeling like i'm failing and i'm trying and it's just frustrating to feel like you know. My best isn't enough.
121.0,Provider,What do you feel like you're failing up.
15542.0,Patient,"To me, just like you know. I think back for two months I am me pretty good personal progress."
121.0,Provider,"you've made very good person progress that was not pretty good, you have made very significant progress."
15542.0,Patient,yeah. But I. don't know I feel like you know my friends are. getting into line relationship shipping on one relationships and career moves and all of that and it's like oh. i'm doing therapy and. wishes.
121.0,Provider,And why are you doing therapy. And so that you can have those things in a healthy and functional way. I guarantee you not all of your friends. are going to be able to have functional healthy relationships that will say.
15542.0,Patient,"or possibly ever yeah. yeah this anecdotally the friend, I was talking to last night she's been dating this guy for three days and have their five year plan laid out was like no. I just wanted because, like. I don't know so much further in life, I am. thankful that I have. A safe place to go and thankful then able to live with my dad being able to get the help I need. At the same time it's like I am. i'm done like I want to. I want to have like an adult life, you know i'm tired of being here and. In between phase."
121.0,Provider,So what steps are you taking to do that.
15542.0,Patient,i'm going to find a job. And haven't interviewed for next week and a potential interview later.
121.0,Provider,Wait sorry say that again.
15542.0,Patient,"I have an interview for next week. To be preschool teacher. In iowa. wessling. And then I have another well i'm trying to say for one to be swim coach but. They had it on like the USA swimming jobs for that they needed someone, and then they responded they're like how to find out about this like they weren't actually hiring and they're like well make an exception something."
121.0,Provider,So it sounds like you submitted some applications this week.
15542.0,Patient,I did a lot of. What you call it a cold call. For a lot of those. Come any of them that's.
121.0,Provider,Why you've heard back from the swim coach and the preschool.
15542.0,Patient,"So free preschool um. I first was like oh my gosh like i've been studying on the low end of that our legal age range and that's not enough money to live on air between further, and I was like oh. Well they're like they're like even like you to have a high school diploma it's not the quarter um well, I have a bachelor's so I like to start significantly higher. Wage in the so that was one of the questions, Mr way. callback in a theater interviews were against it so hopefully that works."
121.0,Provider,"Well, and I think the other thing is to as long as you are making enough to live on. You can move out and keep looking for another job. You know there's nothing saying you have to work with this job for X amount of time. And you know I mean you might get there and love it and want to like pursue more in that field. Or you might get there, and be like this isn't really for me i'm gonna keep looking. But at least That way, you have the safety net of having the income. And you're out of your House and all of that."
15542.0,Patient,yeah.
121.0,Provider,"which I think I mean seems like things are getting more and more tense, for your dad you're starting to get more and more kind of. feeling like you need to make a move and do something."
15542.0,Patient,it's. Great to. See.
121.0,Provider,"Is that something you could talk to them, not today with everything with your sister but sometime in the next week or two you could talk them out as like. It feels like when I got back things were really good things have been more screen lately i'm trying to figure out what what's calls that you have any ideas. Or, I mean, however, you want to phrase it, but like. That type of conversation i'm just like yeah I really want to get back to where we weren't like so i'm trying to figure out, you know, and you can even say like if I did something that's causing the you just. So we can figure out what like how to get back there."
15542.0,Patient,Certain. Other day. And there's a reason I can pull up. A good this morning. That says share next week.
121.0,Provider,We have it now.
15542.0,Patient,"So. Talking about radical acceptance. Michigan deals, because to me it sounded a lot like. she's like this difference between articles and radical acceptance and getting. That just. Let me know it's like just accepting things that were there. You know how does that allow for so I can see. Because I really didn't understand their business fast and she. didn't really know."
121.0,Provider,"So let's think about. What say it's pouring rain outside. You have the option to either. You know, lay down and cry about it and pout and miss out on the things that you were supposed to do that day. Or you could. Not necessarily be happy about it but, except that it's raining grab an umbrella and go about your day. Or you could go and jump in all the puddles and run around. By not accepting it and laying around empowering about it and missing out on everything you're continuing your suffering that doesn't mean that that rains not going to change the sun's not going to come back out. But it means that in that exact moment it is raining and you are accepting those rain does not mean you have to like. does not mean you have to agree with it or think it's a good thing, or anything else, it just means that. In this exact moment, I am going to accept that this is how it is. or acknowledge that this is how it is. And not prolong my own suffering because of how it is and that does not mean that it's not going to change it does not mean that there aren't steps that can be taken to change something. But it means in this moment, instead of letting it. you're having negative impact on me. i'm going to accept that that is how it is right now. and continue on with what I need basically. That make more sense."
15542.0,Patient,"Yes. I still don't understand how that. works. We are. In our personal stuff so someone is not treating the true to. Their article acceptance they're doing it is very doors like an hour to do continue, drawing on that it's in southern so like I said, but just accepted and. Everything i'm saying this is that you."
121.0,Provider,know you can accept that that's how they're treating you by acknowledging that that that is the way that they are talking to you and you still have the power to set boundaries and walk away from it. Does that make more sense.
15542.0,Patient,yeah.
121.0,Provider,"not accepting the sense of like just sitting there and taking it. and accepting it in the sense of acknowledging that. That is how they're treating you you can't control them, but you can control your own actions and whether you. About say except there for trip, but like tolerate being treated that way. was to sitting there and just wishing. I wish they would change I wish they would treat me differently blah blah blah. it's accepting that that is how they're treating you and you have a choice of how you respond to that. So. giving you the power and control back versus sitting around waiting for someone else to change. Which means giving them the power and control and putting yourself in almost of the composition."
15542.0,Patient,"makes sense. And there's there's explain that is not correct. So. Yesterday, some. bonding. shouldn't be this hard to explain the song so Monday I was like i'm struggling i'm jumping. In there. well."
121.0,Provider,it's basically what.
15542.0,Patient,"I like business, but I think I look really good in business flows. And it's fun to dress up like like professional suits and stuff and there's a really fun. And just thinking about it and I thought about like back in the spring, before again me i'm not a dress for interviews and so on, the birth, like, I felt like the embodiment of the male gaze like the secretary. movie by the surgeon institute male writers directors and producers and just like. Unbelievable sexy and then after I came back. I didn't fit me more and At first it was so it's just devastating and then I was able to like put it out in my mind about it for a while. My first thought of it, I was like active i'm like you know what it is what it is like. there's nothing wrong with me and there's nothing wrong with the dressers and being competitive. And that's okay. And what I was actually doing very Okay, with it, and then after explaining it. To the proof, I was. You know, really, really change, you know, maybe it'll fit now, and so I was. hunting for it, I actually had to wear. And I was like i'm gonna try it on see and I couldn't find it couldn't find it and I just like this tales, so what was that. I. Had was. I have no idea that's true. My guess is is. Just more comfortable in. feel better about. False. fasting. Oh. I guess. john."
121.0,Provider,"mack. Well, but yeah. A little bit little bit keep going."
15542.0,Patient,"Like a. slight change in our self talk. And I was like Oh, I wish I hated myself and continued and I didn't have to do the positive A little self talking like this that right with an actor can start. Work is that, like just it wasn't like conscientious self talk and I couldnt identify the internal narrative and it's just a minute we're just getting rolling and more and more self deprecating as I believe. It what's the what's the dialogue here, because my feeling my time yourself and. I just felt like. It was just raining it feels like it's been around for the last couple days and this week. I just feel really. out of control, but my news and its really frustrating. Because for a while i'm just I felt like doing happy, even if so, why and another song That was good, I enjoyed that announcement, but the reverse."
121.0,Provider,What do you think.
15542.0,Patient,"know. So. I kind of feel like. i'm trying to shift back into like out of the you know. accidents. I have all the time. mindset and back into the life. If you notice on for sapphire the rock Johnson. I can do that and. i'm in. I know it's just as hard to get things done, another love, something you didn't. And i'm one of those people. don't get stuck Daniel says external pressure and. I just. Remember. Last year, they have a refresher it just it. will have a student government but there's probably pop up right. and Dr Davis. Just wake up. thinking. And I remember the day checked into the. Pressure on will keep last mention and. whatnot that golden nugget isn't. Everything but I was in particular. And I woke up one day. Better and nothing has changed. So I told them like you know they're doing the intake paperwork and stuff like you know how's it. Going good yesterday days before that, so I don't know what that means. For testing and all came back. It just I don't know."
121.0,Provider,"Well, I think I mean, for instance, on that day, I think it's really common to see a shift in people's moods like when they start treatment because all of a sudden there's like a sense of Oh, this might actually get better. Even if it's not a conscious thought. A lot of times we have that internal kind of sense of relief. So I suspect there are things we just have to figure out what specifically are that are triggering. are playing into me I think it's probably man, I think, hormones probably affected I. think you bring him goals definitely affect that but I suspect that there are other things too like external things that are influencing it as well."
15542.0,Patient,"Well, it sounds that is it's different. So a dreamy sterile consistent with my dad, this is the day she will be back into right, this is the date, you have. She been. Last weekend, but she back into my comments and how. To do this. yeah so my mom said. That to us on to the last two days, she said what it. meant to them. i'm in the most is just go to the phone call for this afternoon. It was either very achievement for her but on. So my dad. My dad you know I had this is a great one says, that is, this is not. This is like something doesn't mean she's really upset it doesn't deny my mom she's like she's like she'll take my own time there wasn't anything make you guys have to go do this, whatever whatever. She didn't read turns out live never told mom that she was supposed to be over here. Because saying i'm realizing is faster because it feels like i'm constantly not mass. and"
121.0,Provider,"I think you're constantly cleaning up her manager constantly having to play peacekeeper between your parents and your sister and. I mean, I think there are a lot. Of stressors there. And I don't think moving is going to solve all those or make them completely go away, but I think being out of that immediate environment will be very helpful for you. yeah and she has while you. are making all these changes, they are not. And so that environment is still the same you were developing skills and everything else to cope with that and manage it. And yet. That still is going to take a big toll on you. Because you were still having to constantly use your skill constantly be on guard constantly having to set boundaries constantly have like it's emotionally exhausting."
15542.0,Patient,i'm especially interested in having this happen i'm just constantly being disrespected. And so I really don't know what to do. and
121.0,Provider,"Well, what are your options."
15542.0,Patient,This. Time and just walk around.
121.0,Provider,And how's that gonna work out for you.
15542.0,Patient,"mean it'll be less conflict, Sir, I will be disrespected and uncomfortable."
121.0,Provider,And play that all the way through how's that going to affect you.
15542.0,Patient,and feel like was last.
121.0,Provider,haha. And how does that affect you.
15542.0,Patient,know. Just. decreases mental health across the board. More depression and anxious. or.
121.0,Provider,"Is that something you're all I want to go through. Okay, so what are your options."
15542.0,Patient,One option is. To just continue a certain. Over and over. Constantly constant fight it's. Just hard. it's just really hard. But. Listen eventually works nights. and
121.0,Provider,So what do you do when they don't respect your boundaries.
15542.0,Patient,So sometimes I don't say. This.
121.0,Provider,"So, every time that you don't say anything. you're reinforcing him walking all over you. you're telling him that boundary I said I didn't really mean it."
15542.0,Patient,"Special. forces she she's. awesome control the game shows all the time. And how I. mean four or five things that. They really specific. And so I needed to every. don't do. A couple of. Things. I didn't want to listen, without fixing. Everything is a crisis everything's happening. Other ones that don't use the word. and so on, so I started doing. That. Remember, I asked you not to do that because it's it's hard for me and. I can talk right. Now, and they're like it's. Yours losing confidence. In. It doesn't work out of this. and asked him not to Tony over heights and surviving members. And what can I just showed you just this just this was a new, it was in the numbers because I just my heart rate and what. happens just let it affect me."
121.0,Provider,Water is not one says. When he doesn't respect your boundaries.
15542.0,Patient,With. A little push backs and. But. Because it is an intern rainforest boundary and the consequences.
121.0,Provider,house up.
15542.0,Patient,"I mean she's really cranky make snipping happen it's just really tense and awkward for a long time. And it's a, for I shouldn't have to do this to. stand up for myself. I should in no uncertain terms of needed."
121.0,Provider,It so if he's tense and snappy then. You remove yourself from the situation. He will eventually learn if the consequences are an off. yeah yeah you're going to keep showing me numbers when we hike i'm not going to hike with you anymore.
15542.0,Patient,"don't get. into too much, but."
121.0,Provider,"I think, with him you've got to be very clear. On what the consequences are. Because he's not. not respecting them, and so I think you've got to be clear and the biggest thing about, that is, you have to set the consequences that. You can and will follow. Otherwise it's an empty threat and he's going to just keep doing the same thing."
15542.0,Patient,it's frustrating for them. Just.
121.0,Provider,Absolutely. that's where setting these boundaries and holding the consequences. He will start to change. And you're not going to have to keep doing this forever.
15542.0,Patient,Trying. i'm. Trying. i'm not I don't want to eat i'm not hungry and just be I want to take him. home. I don't know I can't tell us that when my body stolen and stuff and he can't move on. Just awaiting the sinking restriction and.
121.0,Provider,"Are you aware, other times like ever when you're hungry."
15542.0,Patient,yeah sometimes.
121.0,Provider,"When you are aware of it, how hungry, are you."
15542.0,Patient,Doing.
121.0,Provider,"So you're probably missing some early signs of hunger. That might be something to talk to clean about is having our help you learn to identify the early signs of hunger. And maybe talk to her too, and I can follow up with her to about having you start tracking your hunger fullness. That is something that we did when I was in treatment that was really helpful before each meal, we had to list. Our level of hunger on a scale of one to 10 as well as the emotions, we were feeling. And then, after each meal or snack we had to mark again where our hunger fullness was on that same scale. And at first, I was like this is stupid and pointless you really do actually start seeing patterns, first of all, and second level you start because you're having to check in with yourself like six times a day. You start actually. Recognizing when you're hungry or full. I don't know it would probably be a good thing for you to practice with her when do you meet with her next. Do you want to bring that up with our joint meeting."
15542.0,Patient,That wasn't nice i'm. Just. Do.
121.0,Provider,You feel and what.
15542.0,Patient,But i'm not feeling myself.
121.0,Provider,"I think you've. ignored your hunger and everything I think it's very normal. And we are so bombarded with diet, culture and messages and stuff that that significantly impairs almost everybody's. intuition about food. Until we start making that really mindful effort to reconnect with it. I mean and i'm talking about people without me sort of. Like so many people are influenced just by our culture. That they can't fully tell you when they're hungry or how hungry or half full. So that is not something flawed within you that is flawed within our society that is. Something that very many people struggle. Like think about like. Little kids like real life even babies they cry when they're hungry. They stop when they're full. Even little kids like toddlers and still. Do that to. Like they eat when they're hungry and they stop but then we start doing the things like oh you've got to finish everything on your plate. Oh, you have to eat this. Oh that's not good for you can't eat that here have some more of this instead. And from a very, very young age. We start up. And it teaches us. From a very, very young age, that we. can't trust our own bodies. So I mean it's it's incredibly sad that we do that, to ourselves. Or do that to our culture itself, but you, it is not a something wrong with katie. Anything else you want to talk about today."
15542.0,Patient,So. This. Time. Around 15 he. was wondering. If I decide. What would you think about starting this from the group.
121.0,Provider,"I think he needs to clean about. I think, be you've got to be adequately fueling yourself. and see. If you are paying attention to your body or not. So, like if your body's hurting if you're not feeling good not push yourself to do it. And I think most importantly, well, maybe not this very important because adequately feeling yourself is really important, too. But doing it because you want to do it because it's something you enjoy not to burn calories not to influence your shape."
15542.0,Patient,"Okay, so. This is an industry because, for my own good programming soon. My dad said because, like. For him to change his. Life in faster than. me. i'm. in person and virtually I just missed the water this sentence, and when you sit within. The questions. And then. The person partner we do it to get stronger because I thought it might. I don't i'm getting better, so I have back from Denver, it was. Like the strength, there was. Like rock climbing. a bunch of other stuff okay I kind of understanding the body that. Is a long time password. I want to get stronger. Not necessarily ultimate body shape. Although like. I would like to have a nice that's always been something. is like. doing it for stern alternate shoe."
121.0,Provider,What is the motivation for being strong.
15542.0,Patient,"i'm. Honestly, one of the things I like. I like seeing something."
121.0,Provider,yeah I don't like.
15542.0,Patient,"Knowing I could do things you know. filming. In my body was strong, as I can defend myself. Physical. i'm. Good you know just. So rock climbing. What strikes me and. And Blackberry is just. Simple. And it. goes. It sounds like. There isn't. A tourism. And a sentence. It is. My body and. understand."
121.0,Provider,"I am much more okay with you swimming the morning to the gym. Again I think let's talk with elaine about it. But I think it's something that we can certainly consider and. Maybe put some kind of limitations on it first of you know how long or how many times a week or whatever. But. I mean, I think it's something that we can we could probably explore and and try and see and you know as long as you're being honest about kind of how it's affecting you and everything else. And you know you're really adequately and stuff I. Think because, like I said it's not that we don't ever want you to."
15542.0,Patient,Like.
121.0,Provider,Do any kind of physical activity.
