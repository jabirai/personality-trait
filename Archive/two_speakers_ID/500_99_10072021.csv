Just. kind of picked up the conversation that we started very briefly in or that I started with you in group around. Maybe early childhood pain that is still in you and no I heard in the group that you're not sure if you want to you know, look at that more, but I just want to open up the possibility again because you know it might not. seem like it's in the way of things, although I do suspect it could it could be in the way of some things in your life I don't know what it's but, so I just wanted to. To put the invitation out to you. What do you think."
500.0,Patient,yeah yes again. Maybe in the way of things is.
99.0,Provider,What do you think what do you think it might be in the way of if you if you really get honest with yourself like. impacting you.
500.0,Patient,"Just like going more in life, getting more and more. Because they guess just. I guess being younger is just like my dad and then every really like one more like succeeded to get more, but which is really smart man he had like is he went to school got a degree in. Our project is but be able to build houses and stuff but it just seemed like. You never wanted to get better things because when you live really poor and just. And just you never know I guess one more so now it feels like maybe. I don't know, maybe i'm taking after him because they don't go out to do more and more."
99.0,Provider,"awesome so the the lack of aspiration for. And how do you think whatever. Whatever trauma that you endured as a child, how do you think that is connected to this potentially."
500.0,Patient,Maybe just because I thought it was normal to me my community. Timely doesn't seem like you want more you want to do.
99.0,Provider,"That painful to talk about that. yeah. What are you feeling right now, as you share this. Can you can you remember a time in your life, where. Your inspiration was flowing more freely and you did actually have dreams of something."
500.0,Patient,"Go back to school, which I did. just finish it."
99.0,Provider,there's a part of you that wants to complete something.
500.0,Patient,yeah.
99.0,Provider,"uh huh. And, and what would the motivation of going to school be would it be to learn, or to actually have access to do certain work in the world, or both, or something else, what would the motivation to go back to school be."
500.0,Patient,Great both yeah right patient. need to get a job or.
99.0,Provider,"A hot so there's Okay, so I hear you know there's a motivation to learn and. Then to to practice a pain in the Community by by working somehow. yeah these are really. Pretty reasonable invalid needs, and I can see why maybe some sadness is coming up that. These needs aren't being met. Let me how is it to to listen to this conversation is what what goes on for you as you hear this. Is it confusing, is it, are you not sure what's happening and why your mom's feeling this way."
500.0,Patient,Thank you.
99.0,Provider,"So it's not confusing. What are you feeling right. What do you, what do you mean can you can you explain to me a little more."

500.0,Patient,"kind of sad. i'm doing the same thing to them, not. being more than what they want to be here. I kind of like. I don't want to feel like we have a parents to me."
99.0,Provider,"Is it is it that you don't want to set that example like your dad set. don't want to put words in your mouth, I just want to understand is that what you're saying."
500.0,Patient,"yeah I just don't like not giving them the opportunity to be more which I don't I always push them and push them to succeed is open now it'll come out from diamond no. No know I wish I had somebody that come to me when I was younger, you know you guys rock you have mean because i'm pushing you to do it, you know and how my parents never question you do nothing, and like. He just pushes. Know i'm doing too much work. and succeed and. Have goals. Well you're really."
99.0,Provider,"Nobody telling you. yeah. And you're speaking to something so powerful with parenting is children learn so much by what parents models so. You can say, but if you're actually doing it that's what they learn from."
500.0,Patient,yeah.
99.0,Provider,"Like here's an example, my dad he worked out a lot she loves taking care of his health and always when I was growing up he'd be like you know, we need to take care of our bodies, you need to exercise, you need to eat well. And I didn't like to hear it. You know I don't want to hear it, but when I watched him take care of himself and eat well and saw how healthy, he was that's what I learned like oh okay when he does all those things he's in good health."
500.0,Patient,And yeah.
99.0,Provider,"that's as an adult now, when I look back, I see well more than him telling me anything, it was a way that he just did it that. impacted me, you know. yeah so it sounds like it's really confronting you know. To to look at these things and. And face maybe the sadness that right now, no just right now you're feeling. what's that like fireball."
500.0,Patient,fireball she's. going to.
99.0,Provider,Be. What would be one step. You know hutcheon and tapping into that motivation in yourself more than or just in a way that you feel more satisfied.
500.0,Patient,"Maybe just doing stuff without having to think about him. Do it like you said just. Do it I think too much I don't do anything, because what happens."
99.0,Provider,yeah sometimes we can overthink things and talk ourselves out of out of many things.
500.0,Patient,"yeah, we should not do it or yeah."
99.0,Provider,or find all the reasons why we would you know it would just be a failure if we did it so just don't even do it.
500.0,Patient,was having a bad dream that I didn't make to employment and you were yelling is weird.
99.0,Provider,"Oh, my gosh well I would never yell at you i'll just say that."

99.0,Provider,"Well, James can be really powerful you know, like they're. The characters in the dream sometimes there are parts of us if if you look at me and the dream as a part of view what part of you do you think that might have represented."
500.0,Patient,"ministering to just keep going and. So often. I mean I grew up in, and so, like everybody else. That makes it I just. Last week, when I hit the mark Jones is being in my attendance and all that and just tell me what real good job I. felt really good."
99.0,Provider,What feelings come up as you tell me that because it sounded like. Something started to.
500.0,Patient,never really. Good job you know.
99.0,Provider,"So crazy new so acknowledging that you've really committed to your recovery and you show up and. Well, I want to say you've been so consistent with our individual therapy I I appreciate it because I show up for you guys and when you guys come, I really appreciate it and it's helped I think it's really helped to keep you on track."
500.0,Patient,"yeah. I go to my group and I miss, and only if I really wish I didn't have the guide Mrs June, and then I missed that one week, and that was it was like whoa."
99.0,Provider,yeah so. So let's take a moment and just to really let in the praise that jonah's proud of you i'm so proud of you. You know you're doing great and the growth never ends it's like you're doing great and it sounds like a part of you wants more.
500.0,Patient,yeah I think so.
99.0,Provider,"And it seems like a natural progression like you've. you've gotten to this point, it seems like there's more stability so once their stability, this is like one of the major principles. Of yoga when our foundation is strong. We can reach up. so on. solid ground beneath you can start to reach out a little more because you're not in survival mode."
500.0,Patient,"yeah. Anyway, he managed i'm not giving you. She really wants firewall. One of the two yeah. she's funny."
99.0,Provider,she's real funny now she's turning into a little fireball.

99.0,Provider,"So, so that sounds like a like a really powerful time Miranda for you, you know you're you're touching into some really tender parts, you know and recognizing like you didn't get much praise. And how that's impacted. You and you had this example that your dad set of not really reaching for more and there's a party that wants more."
500.0,Patient,yeah you.
99.0,Provider,"And I totally believe in you, I know. You can have more if you just you just you know move towards what you want, I know you can do it."
500.0,Patient,yeah I think it's good.
99.0,Provider,"Well, do you think it would be helpful to look at some of the goals that you had. set and see what you've accomplished and then maybe set some. Some small goals to move towards else that you want, whatever it is."
500.0,Patient,yeah.
99.0,Provider,"yeah okay. All right, let's see. So. he's. What a great little friend, he is. I love his ears. or her yours is chick see a girl or boy."

500.0,Patient,"Then I did I started watching. myself to go like this because I wanted it but. I thought, what am I just. gave up."
99.0,Provider,"Well, I imagine you might have been overwhelmed with whatever was going on at home, like a kid can only handle so much and. there's a lot. of chaos at home, you know the. kids just kind of shut down on some."
