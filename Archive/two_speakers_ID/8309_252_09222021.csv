Like my health wise like I was in really you know, keeping up with it, I was eating out a lot, so I I went I did my physical and we made sure, everything was good, starting in attrition so I was like okay i'm good. And then, it was like no it's not. yeah so I mean i'm still trying i'm back at work now but it's still i'm still not 100 I mean i'm i'm in a scary because they feel like. Since i'm still not like i'm still having a class I feel like for me i'm still contagious it's like I still have a symptom. And i'm just kind of scared not for myself, but for others I just don't want to get anybody sick, I know that you know, I was like you not have enough like a lot of symptoms but i'm not trying to get anybody."
252.0,Provider,Totally and. I want you to to remember that both of the experiences both of the medical issues that you went through was it.

252.0,Provider,"Sure, are you still testing positive."
8309.0,Patient,"um the last time I tested, which was the 10th I want to say I was still positive yeah so. There was a little bit of confusion, because. My siblings also tested positive but they had no symptoms, so they had me retest them. The school mind me to retest them the county was like there's no point they're still going to be positive. Just after the 10 days if they have no symptoms they're good, but you know, they should be okay. But, for some reason they the school is for another test, even though they say no, it was going to come up positive either way. So the county told me not to do them again. And because they don't know how like how long it will come up positive just the after the 10 days you're no longer contagious. But it's still it's still pretty scary yeah."
252.0,Provider,there's fear you.
8309.0,Patient,Know yeah.
252.0,Provider,"yeah. And I understand that fear anybody to be afraid, you have to know that it's not displeased here. yeah you know. it's okay to yeah I mean look at you know you think about everything that everybody has experienced the past year over this stuff so. yeah yeah."
8309.0,Patient,"I mean, I mean I think of it and and like I said I got lucky, not to have all those symptoms and that's what the way I look at it, but i'm like. You know, not everybody is going to run with the same luck and i'm like i'm just. Like for any way like pull someone like just like not trying like i'm I was like i'm not trying to get you sick i'm sorry i'm not going to show you a tentative, even if they say i'm not contagious I was like i'm sorry i'm not going to say. Okay."

252.0,Provider,we've watched the world go crazy over it.
8309.0,Patient,"yeah and I honestly I was i've gotten pretty far with about getting it I didn't even think it was going to happen, but I mean. I did I did it just because of this whole they remove the mask like more nuts, they didn't remove the masses just you know. Supposedly, those who are vaccinated don't have to wear one, but I still kept wearing mine but I didn't work around my siblings and then being back at school was what kind of how I got it."
252.0,Provider,Okay.
8309.0,Patient,"So. I mean I knew it was gonna happen, but I think it was gonna be like soon."
252.0,Provider,yeah you just got over. they'll post yeah just popped out on the view.
8309.0,Patient,yeah. You know yeah.
252.0,Provider,"So you're just barely catching your breath from that and then Bam you get you know cool good so you've got to kind of give yourself time to walk through the shock, you know the amazement, the fear going to go through it all, and I just want to remind you that, and here you said. No more the outpost wasn't the one. And yeah pull that you're kicking codes, but to."
8309.0,Patient,yeah. Hopefully.
252.0,Provider,Remember that.
8309.0,Patient,yeah hopefully it'll it'll get better I mean i'm like I said I still have a cost but. it's definitely has to go out it can't it can't stick around for long.
252.0,Provider,"Right your body, you know yeah. So you got to give yourself a break."
8309.0,Patient,to breed yeah yeah.
252.0,Provider,"I get that I would be i'd be the same way, you know."
8309.0,Patient,"chance, and I think I think we'll get through to it's like financially. Like I was in school, I was working, one day, so I figured like In school I mean, as it as it was hard and I figured like you know i'm gonna make myself but it's Okay, because it'll still keep me like you know. Where I should be so I can keep going to school and. Then just finish off. And then, it was like summer came and that my parents wanted to go to Mexico, that it was like. they'll Fonzie, then you know came back coven and then now currently my both my grandparents are saying so that's even more. My grandma has covered and my grandpa had a car accident and so it's like a little more to worry about so it's it's a lot, but I know like you know, hopefully, you know they'll be okay. Thankfully they haven't had anything severe but it's still pretty scary for them as well."
252.0,Provider,It is it's usually scary your grandpa's okay.
8309.0,Patient,"yeah I mean, from what I, from what I heard the the have done a couple tests, but nothing major he did like he had had one previously. And he had broke a rib and I think he had injured his arm. And now, this correct said, I believe it was just everything Okay, but. I don't know like because. They live in Mexico and they're very hard headed. yeah so it's very hard to say like whether they're completely going to get him away from driving try to keep them home he's not a homebody so he likes being no he likes. Yes, he likes doing that going out all day, every day, every day there's not a day he doesn't go out. So it's kind of hard and just him wanting to go out there, not knowing if he's gonna be okay he's gonna be what a dry but he's I think he's at an age where because he was when I was there, he was saying he often forgets where he's is he gets lost. So he tries to find his way back, but i'm just like. No like no, you need like to need to stay home, but a lot of my family's doesn't want to add admit to like. Saying like you know you're no longer in the age where you can go out and do that stuff and just you know go to the mountains and then come back you know you're you're getting lost you're getting her like. they're just not. I guess wanting to tell him or wanting to confront him about that or like looking for help, and obviously in Mexico it's different so. I don't know how it works or how they can get help so that he's not. Like just wondering."
252.0,Provider,"I don't know about my skill, but here, you know they would you would. definitely be able to get help you know."
8309.0,Patient,"yeah well I know they have some. There too, but I don't know how it works, I mean I don't think it's the same thing, like it is here where you know if. You know another family can decide for them and there's just kind of I think it plays by money and honestly. I mean i'm sure they would be okay with like pain, but it's totally they just not wanting to come from my grandpa my grandpa about like him not leaving. And then my grandma to with covert she was she was good and then she's trying to leave the House now because she felt better and then we're like no you're still not okay."
252.0,Provider,don't leave the House.
8309.0,Patient,"yeah she's like no i'm okay i'm like. you're not leaving and that, from what I, from what I my cousin said, told me they had had to keep her locked in the room, because they they just they're at I think there's just a at the age where they're just. There they're just not completely there and not aware of what's good for their health and what they need."
252.0,Provider,yeah yeah sounds like you need a caregiver.
8309.0,Patient,"yeah. And the woman my. lives there, but still there they're not looking for that whole confrontation it's more like Okay, you know you bigger thing, but I think for their safety, they just they just need to do it."
252.0,Provider,yeah they do and it's not about trying to take away any other rights or you know. yeah anything but it's about keeping them safe.
8309.0,Patient,"yeah yeah yeah and I listen, I saw my I think I I kind of broke that whole not wanting to confirm, I did come from my dad about it and, like I just don't think I even from his first accident I I told my my. My dad like I do not feel like they should be out there, because nobody nobody does this where they they compress like but because they're older because I mean obviously you have to respect them because they're older but i'm like I am respecting you but you got to know like."
252.0,Provider,I care.
8309.0,Patient,"I care and you still gotta like make some decisions here because they're still your parents and you know I know you want them around, but in order for them to stay along. Around a lot longer you know you got to take care of them like it's not it's not how that works, you know you just don't like let them do whatever they want like they mean it would be nice if they could still do their own thing but it's not that way."
252.0,Provider,"yeah so they've got to be taken care of and I agree with you yeah and it's about keeping them safe, and you know it's not that they can't go out and do anything but. You know, it is about. You know, allowing them to have you know somebody with them so that they're safe about it, you know."
8309.0,Patient,"yeah yeah and that's. Where my mom is OK, but my grandpa is the one who's like he likes doing his own thing he doesn't like. Anybody with them, he just leaves them comes back really late usually comes right back at seven or eight at night he was in the morning. And it's just it's just scary just not knowing I mean if anything could happen and prior like I think between as a weird thing happened after I came back from Mexico he had. He was having him some heart problems and. They ended up taking taking him to the hospital and they found out that he had an enlarged heart. So yeah so I apparently he's had a heart attack from the past, so it was something that we didn't even know so just knowing that and knowing he's going out there by himself since i'm really faithful."
252.0,Provider,doesn't sound like it's very safe at all.
8309.0,Patient,So I don't really know where.
252.0,Provider,yeah so that is a lot of stress from you. So we're going to take care of yourself.
8309.0,Patient,"Well, since I saw an attritional. I just figure I still keep going along with that. I had was, I think, was my primary and my nutrition so we're kind of. Trying to set like my eating habits and like. Exercise I have lost about 10 times, though."
252.0,Provider,Oh no.
8309.0,Patient,"And in the past month i'll send. Know it's. It has been good so i've been trying to still keep up with that, just so that. I have something to do something to kind of not too too much stress myself over oh my God, I have to lose weight, but just to get myself to a better place so that I can like do better be more healthy hopefully not get sick anymore and yeah that's my my main focus. yeah. You know i'm trying. yeah."
252.0,Provider,it's amazing you know you have persevered over bell's palsy over Kofi and you know you're making life changes all of that is saying hey I matter.

But I mean I i'm trying i'm really trying I just I don't want to be in that Funk, and you know. always be like oh I anxious or just feeling down I don't feel I don't want to be that way I don't want to be just laying are stuck in my room, I really just want to go out and not have to worry about stuff like that. yeah you know at the moment I just can't really say that it says, you know code is still around and it's not getting any better. yeah."
252.0,Provider,"Oh, you got to keep yourself safe. and listen if you find out if you find yourself not being able to pull out of you know, the Funk right then talk to Mary are you on antidepressants."
8309.0,Patient,"I said I was, I was thinking one it was for like anxiety and so the gunship depressant. And I didn't want to take it, because I feel like I don't want to stay in the medication, so I want to look like outside of medication, what I can do on my side because I feel like i'm not wanting to do medication forever. yeah or not, that I will, but I just don't want to do it and. I feel like it's better just to try to figure out other ways that I can cope with it."
