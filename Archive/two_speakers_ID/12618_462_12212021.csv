My mom was a strong woman. tiffany Bernie even Bernie like she might be the weakest one but she's still like will you know say how she feels you know. And we're all strong people, and I remember telling people about that and they're like if you were another family are not as strong they probably would have just let one of us going to see her. And just. We fought so fucking lunch with the doctors and everything. yeah because we grew up in the medical. environment with my mom and you know tiffany's smile, and then we have our our tiffany's husband's family we're all nurses nurses and doctors and my boyfriend's a doctor, not a mental he's smart he reads papers and. He knows how to speak. I could tell like he could speak to another doctor and they kind of like hey we're both intelligent level. yeah you know I understand like what's going on, and on that and. says all like the shitty things that happened, like all the horrible mail. And stuff that happened to me and just like this, like I survived like I was just talking about how I went up to that one sexual predator guy at the part. Because I was like Fuck you like, sometimes like i'm just like Fuck you and that like that's awesome that's scarier than yelling at anyone because he was like he already did something to me he had nothing to lose because he's fucking. homeland that see like that that's something like yeah you have nothing to lose and he was a huge fucking dude he wasn't a small dude. Like. Maybe I could take a lot of bravery. Oh yeah. And then, like just going to school and everyone hated means being alone and just like being like whatever Oh, you know, like it takes. Like I told a nice like oh yeah the Nice told me the same thing the other, the chick the other chick from thanksgiving told me she like they don't like you know I don't like you, because you're a strong woman.

Like and everything his family's not like. So yeah."
462.0,Provider,And how does that make you feel hearing that.
12618.0,Patient,"Well that's obvious that i've everything they're not. But it makes me feel good definitely about the strong woman part. Because i've heard that before from people like they're like I remember guys some guys at school, would be like I like your don't Fuck with me attitude like. i'm not. yeah. So that does make me feel good but I went I went through a lot of shit. And I just I think I have my mom was a strong person and I just in movies, I. I idolized strong females and. And i'm like i'm that person, you know, like you know how sometimes like your that character like i'm like i'm definitely. See you can read your kiddo.

12618.0,Patient,"polly like my biggest thing is just like. or I don't. My biggest thing is just. i'm. Just I don't know like still dealing with. My mom not being here. Like I still don't. Like only caught up yesterday in group I like totally broke down because, like they're asking, like everyone how they're doing and, like the person. In front of the person that they asked before me like had a total fucking meltdown like had, and I was like oh yeah she she has problems like i'm just I mean I have, I mean. I feel like I been through a Warren and like they took my family. So um. But, unlike so after that I don't know I just sometimes when I talk about my mom like sometimes they could just talk and like tears will come down and sometimes. Oh yeah This is like. Positive but then I was just saying like how. I like to be by the beach because, like. I like to take walks by beach, because if her soul. Is anywhere it's at the beach like it's in the ocean that's why I, when I was in Hawaii I was just in the water, the whole time. Like talking searching for her, and it was weird because I remember finding Nemo was like my favorite movie and then I went I wanted it with my mom she was like I feel like i'm marlon the dad and then I mean. yeah like cuz I was so self destructive. And so, she was always trying to find me like in Hollywood and. I kind of set her through a whole like cat and mouse game. You know because I was mad at her for neglecting me, but then i'm like but not, I mean she could have done to Jacqueline could have done something. But like should so much shame on her play it's so hard being a single mother like I don't really like. would say I had like I had both parents, but I both parents or my mom like my dad was kind of you know what I mean."
462.0,Provider,yeah he wasn't. You were present from what you said.
12618.0,Patient,"He was not going to like a huge Prince, they would go to the principal office, because I was there, but then they would start fighting in. Jesus Christ. yeah people."
462.0,Provider,"So the biggest struggle for you, currently, it seems like is just continuing to work through this grief of your mom and also. Tell us. drama stories all of these memories, that you have your whole family and your mom obviously passed and then you set boundaries, with the rest obviously lost Paris as well, so I want to bring it back to that idea of making a book with different chapters for all of these stories."
12618.0,Patient,And I.
462.0,Provider,Like that could still be a really healing.
12618.0,Patient,"yeah i'm still doing that I always done with my business file and I know you just got back for you, you had a trip last week oh yeah. yeah."
462.0,Provider,"But that could be a good place to start with. The grief right to continue finding your way through it, because it's easy to get lost in it."
12618.0,Patient,yeah and I definitely felt like I was lost in it. I feel like i'm definitely like still in Atlanta definitely like. i'm definitely still in it like really early you know and oh yeah so i'm i'm at with the girl yesterday from my fashion class.

12618.0,Patient,"Oh yeah and then I told her about my dog and she was talking about her dog but um it's like my dog was like like Paris was human she's so human and she was like every incarnation of me is so freakin weird. When she was a one person dog. And then she's like no my dog was just a dog. She was beautiful but she was a bitch. Like chooses a one I forgot them it's like a Japanese breed and they're kind of more the kind of more like a dog like shins out, which is."

Like, no, no, no, no, no, like Paris would never. And um yeah. that's how like personal like my soulmate soulmate. Like Sony and then right and then my mom was like."
462.0,Provider,"Just very complex, so it all going on. yeah quickly and kind of at once, and so that's why you know again you felt very lost in the grief and you still just feel you've got this clarity and other areas, but still just some kind of heaviness and fogginess there."
12618.0,Patient,"yeah I just yeah yeah and yeah and I started crying I think yesterday and group, because I was just like. I can be nice, but a lot of shit has happened to me that i'm not like the most nice person like right off the BAT like for sure.
