A piece of chicken lice, which i've never dealt with before it just little tiny bug and its really, really, really common, like most lot of chickens out but um so it's just like watching all these videos but. Species specific so it doesn't bother humans at all. or other animals but it's because they say the it kind of comes from wild birds and that live in your yard and then transfer it so that's what i'd be. How are you how did you get your little one."
1692.0,Patient,"So I did this is a long story like okay. But. So I picked her up Friday morning and. yeah I don't know like. Friday through Sunday. I don't know I have like. I don't even know how to like I felt terrible on like Monday and yesterday and stuff but Friday through Sunday like she she is like a really good girl, and everything. But she like you know she definitely wasn't used to being by herself and like. anytime. I would like turn my back from her puppy pen she would start like howling and."
120.0,Provider,yeah the crap.
1692.0,Patient,yeah through like throughout Friday and Saturday night. She was just like crying for most of the night and like I even like I was sleeping in the living room like extrovert CRATE. But i'm like all my neighbors like we're kind of upset about it.
120.0,Provider,Oh no.
1692.0,Patient,"yeah so and my neighbors below me have two dogs and they were getting really wound up so they were howling like the whole weekend. say to really anxious dogs and. Like matt was getting really frustrated. And like he wasn't like you know super outwardly like whatever, but he was definitely really upset. And so on Sunday, I was like i'm not sure if this is a good time for this like I had like ready and spent like months preparing and everything and I knew that it would get better and a couple of weeks. But, and like I went for a run Sunday morning like I was homes, the whole weekend I went to her on Sunday morning and. She was like crying the entire time I was on like for an hour and a half and like. it's just so hard like living in an apartment building and like man it's not really able to help out like it's affecting him a lot too. And like I told him I was like well, like the family, who I like adopted her from they said, like at any point if you know something comes up like they would love to take any of the puppies back. And like I didn't ask for any my money back or anything but I just like texted her and was like hey. So, like, I would really love to keep her and everything, but like within my end it's not even like I live in an apartment building. it's more almost like duplexes but like we've like the top half of the duplex. But. yeah and she was like oh yeah sure thing like whatever and it seems like the families actually going to keep her because they were like her favorite letter and, like the husband like really liked this little pop so like they're actually really happy to see her again. And it was. You know it's definitely really sad like bringing her back after only like two or three days and. But like I had not seen her that happy like at all when she got back it's all them and stuff and. She was."
120.0,Provider,really good yeah.
1692.0,Patient,yeah so she was really happy about it and. yeah so I feel like really terrible about.
120.0,Provider,What do you feel terrible you did the right thing by her.
1692.0,Patient,yeah.
120.0,Provider,"That for you, because it didn't work out but she's okay."
1692.0,Patient,"yeah yeah like and she was it's clear that, like she definitely. it's like i'm sure she would have adjusted with time, but like."
120.0,Provider,"She would have but it's but you know it might not always be the best timing for you, you know and matt and your housing situation you know and it's okay it's Okay, it happens, you know."
1692.0,Patient,yeah.
120.0,Provider,"A new foster dog that I just took on the last Sunday nine month old particle a puppy and he drive me crazy but. But the first couple of nights I kept him in my car, because I, because he was yelling so much and how willing, they would have never been away from his family, his you know his siblings and. And i'm like my name and I live out the country and my my my neighbors are still going to hear that, and so I get it, you know that's why I put them in the car, the first couple of nights. And then put a bark collar on him, so that if you have holes in it can vibrate and makes him he's he still does it but it's getting better but it's it's it's a hard hard hard thing for the puppies to go through, because they're like i've been adopted what's happening, you know. We are, and so it's normal for them to cry and make a huge fast, especially at the beginning, you know and it's hard to deal with, if you don't have like. You know, a CRATE you can just lock them away and without somebody being woken up by it, you know. yeah it's hard to just ignore them that's why I use my car, but then. Somebody out where you're at my ego that's cruel or something like that you know but. I don't know you gotta do what you gotta do to take care of you, so I hope that you're being kind to yourself about it."
1692.0,Patient,"yeah i'm trying to like I think Sunday Sunday, I linked didn't think about it too much like I just didn't wanna you know but Monday was really, really hard. And like matt kept on saying he was like you're doing the right thing, like. yeah and don't be too hard on yourself like don't beat yourself up. But, and he was really sad about it, too, but he was like yeah in the future if we like have a standalone place that we're living. You know, or we want to adopt like an older dog or anything like that he said just like when the timing is better and, like our resources are more conducive like raising a puppy or like adopting. He would really like to and when he's able to help out. Like my main concern was I was just also really afraid."
120.0,Provider,you're also like.
1692.0,Patient,"Oh i'm sorry yeah like I was also just really worried that it would put like a lot of strain on our relationship, because he's like in just a super busy time like he's like trying to finish school he, like it's doing a lot of like interviews and stuff like that. yeah. Like working and so his stress levels already like really high, and I could just tell over the weekend, he was like shutting down like humans so."
120.0,Provider,"You handle it yeah and that's and it's Okay, you know you gave it a shot you didn't you took a big risk and you had an experience and you learn some stuff from it, you know. And you know one thing that I like to do is is kind of put it on the back burner where that's going to happen at some point when when the time is right, you know my my world will collide with it with the world of a dog that needs. And and it's just not there yet."
1692.0,Patient,yeah.
120.0,Provider,"So and it's Okay, I know I know it's it's it's mixed man I get it, you get that. No."
1692.0,Patient,"yeah totally like once I like dropped her back off with like the family, like she likes all the kids and was like super happy and everything I was like okay like I don't feel bad like he's already in our vacation for her like never free day."
120.0,Provider,"Well, I mean I don't know if you are you on Facebook much."
1692.0,Patient,I am IA.
120.0,Provider,In my area there's a whole bunch of. pet pet pages.
1692.0,Patient,For the.
120.0,Provider,"For the county I live in and people are frequently you looking to re home adult dogs. And like you can always look and see if you know, there might be a better fit you know, like there might be a dog that's older that's already housebroken that's already, you know that person is just moving or they found other kids allergic or something like that. You know you don't have because the puppy thing is is so tough, because you have to basically remove them from their family and that's a little traumatic for them and. You know they don't know what the heck is happening, and you can't explain it to them, and it does take you know at least a good I saw. This interesting graphic. The other day that I thought of you, I was going to show it to you. and I thought it was an interesting. piece, if I can find the one that. i'm. Like when I saw we're going to be defined it anyway it's a little chart that kind of talks about the stages of. Adapting to a new dog like what to expect in the first is like the chart of threes or something. Oh, it was like what to expect in the first three days what to expect in the first three weeks and what to kind of look for the first three months, and the first three days is usually crazy chaos. You know it's yeah frying and they will eat and they will you know I don't know if your puppy was eating, but a lot of times they will eat. And they're just all kinds of stressed and then after about three weeks they're starting to kind of get used to the routine you know, an after three months when they kind of start finally settling in. But it takes a long time and it's you know not in it doesn't mean that you're that you did anything wrong."
1692.0,Patient,yeah.
120.0,Provider,my brother when they got their dog he kept calling me cuz he's like I can't stand this dog is crying all night and i'm like. I know you just gotta leave it in there and. We used to put a clicking rate click click.
1692.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
120.0,Provider,"ticking clock in there doesn't want to say. So that it sounded like give them something to listen to you, and you know what do you have neighbors it's it adds so much stress, because you don't want them to be mad at you. know. He can't lift the bar color on a puppy you can go. There, because the eternal have you back."
1692.0,Patient,"yeah totally that's like yeah that was like one of the bigger things too like. I just felt so bad, because I know a lot of my neighbors are like they're like working people, they have, like some of them have young kids like some of other dogs that are like pretty sensitive and. Like. Yes."
120.0,Provider,"yeah it's a it's an issue that's for sure, protecting listen to this dog barking out right now i'm thinking, maybe his. The color have it was probably out of battery. he's he's like. But. it's not. Trying to not get him in the House all the time i'm trying to keep him outside but. He doesn't. So, but I hope that you can be kind to yourself about it."
1692.0,Patient,"yeah yeah I think i'm getting over it more now but. yeah Monday was like really, really hard it's like."
120.0,Provider,You already volunteered a cat shelter don't you.
1692.0,Patient,"I do yeah and it's actually like they have cats and dogs. And I mainly like on the cat side which i'm happy with, and I also I picked up a shift on Monday there, and so that, like. made me feel a lot better to like just you know hanging out there and like. yeah so and I told matt on like Monday morning, or something he thought it was funny but he was like don't talk like that, but I was like y'all i'll pick up more shifts at the. At Center county pause that's what it's called but I was like yeah i'll pick up more it shifts there to to atone for my sins. Like stop. Make sure that just just chill out."
120.0,Provider,"You eat sugar risk in it, you just learned that lesson every time and that's okay. you're. The first person i'll tell you what that that happens to."
1692.0,Patient,"You know yeah for sure so. I just i'm trying not to let it like feed the narrative that I have of like i'm really good at just like taking on big things and then like not following through with them, and I feel like I feel like I do that and so that was like. On Monday I just felt really bad about myself because. I can't do stuff like that."
120.0,Provider,Do you have a pattern of doing that because i've never really seen you do that.
1692.0,Patient,"I feel like. I mean, I think it was mostly like. When I was like in France and I left early. And then I like sign off the teach for America went through the training had like a total meltdown like just. Everything was like. Oh no like last I guess like July of 2020 June June slash July and. I beat myself up a lot for that and I like. applied for Grad school and I was going to do Grad school, but then I realized that the amount of money that I was making would like put me in a ton of debt if I did that, so I was like well, I guess, I have to keep working and like actually find the job. So I like. didn't start Grad school and I just feel like i've been like tripping over my feet like. I mean it's definitely getting better but. yeah I just don't want that to be like a character flaw that I have."
120.0,Provider,"I I highly doubt that is secure just offer you from what you're explaining it sounds very much like normal human behavior. Trying something that sounds good, but then it doesn't work, you know, and I think it takes courage to get out of something. Like frequently I mean you think about the time when you were with Alex you know is that I wish you had had it then you know to be like this is me, you know, like I almost feel like you. i'm glad that you have that ability now to say you know i'm not i'm not just going to suffer through this because it's not it's not working, you know. Like what the Grad school and all that when you. Have that feeling in your gut like this isn't right that you followed it, and you trusted that instead of trying to say come on you're being a whim or you're backing out or whatever you didn't let that narrative run off with you."
1692.0,Patient,yeah. yeah totally.
120.0,Provider,"it's totally Okay, you know I mean you can always if you still if you feel like there's a hole in your in your world that needs love you know you could eat other cat you could try that you could. Just just breathe through while and just let things be status quo for a while, because you've gone through a lot of changes. yeah nice few months."
1692.0,Patient,yeah sure.
120.0,Provider,and it's okay. hi Lucy.
1692.0,Patient,yeah I would love to adopt another cat it's just the Aspen is like so territorial and let.
120.0,Provider,me just.
1692.0,Patient,"wrap yeah I think she's like getting a little bit better because, like as i've been coming home like. smelling like other cats after being at the shelter she's like slowly been like okay this isn't like I shouldn't be in danger mode, but maybe just because she like hasn't been around with my cats like she definitely was like very uncomfortable Wyatt. But."
120.0,Provider,What was her response to the puppy or to achieve and get to meet the puppy.
1692.0,Patient,"She was actually surprisingly really good about it. Like she and like I mean I had like a CRATE and puppy pen that was like connected to the CRATE so she had like her own space. But Aspen would like come out and at first, she was like you know she got all like fluffy."
120.0,Provider,yeah.
1692.0,Patient,"Really nervous, but she never wants like his the puppy. She like came up like every like couple of hours she'd like come up to the other side of the puppy pen and just like watch. uh huh puppy like was familiar with cats like they had two cats were like she grew up with her letter and so she was like Okay, like, I know what this is, but she was still kind of intimidated by Aspen she was just like sitting there like staring at her. So she didn't like act super she didn't like get into the i'm sure she would have like tried to play with her a little bit. If it had like gone on for you know, a couple more days. But she was like good about it, which I was pretty impressed by."
120.0,Provider,"that's awesome. So oh yeah I mean, I had a when I was a kid we had a cat and then I got an additional kitten and. The for the first little while the adult cat just want nothing to do with that kitten you know just like like it was mad and not you know, was not tolerating the new kitten very well, so one time we. Basically. covered her head with like a towel the adult cat. and Just basically rub the kitten on her body. else would match it, you know. yeah and then she started liking, the cat it's like she's like Oh, you must be one of us now, you know. With the kitten things like that and kind of mothering it so you know they went from being enemies, to be friends, and then they kind of became they weren't really good friends, but they become kind of just neutral, you know. calculus yes, she doesn't love the other cast, but she did she tolerates time again, is kind of ignore each other."
1692.0,Patient,yeah totally.
120.0,Provider,I lose things very. Soon we're. Just like gazing at me like hi.
1692.0,Patient,Thank.
120.0,Provider,Oh so you're feeling a little a little better than you were on when this first was fresh.
1692.0,Patient,yeah yeah yeah i'm feeling a little bit better.

1692.0,Patient,"Okay, and then i'm like oh."
120.0,Provider,"Well, actually respect between shifts yeah."
1692.0,Patient,yeah so that's like a hard conversation to. get into and.

120.0,Provider,Right.
1692.0,Patient,"Then, or whatever, but. yeah."
120.0,Provider,"You know that it's interesting that, like I know a lot of people who have. You know when they've gotten pregnant they don't announce it until after like 20 weeks or whatever, because they don't want. to lose it and then have to figure out how to tell people that."
1692.0,Patient,"yeah and I. I just like started I didn't really know about that, until both my. My brother's wife and my I don't know if I told you my one brother is getting married this weekend."
120.0,Provider,And it was already realized that.
1692.0,Patient,You know it's like kind of a they decided like six weeks ago. Because it was and I love them both.
120.0,Provider,"Is she pregnant, did you say."
1692.0,Patient,"yeah so she. Okay, and they they've been engaged since like march of 2020 so they like have definitely had the plan to get married. But then they decided to do a little bit sooner and everything. yeah just be cool I like I feel like either a you know, hopefully, but I think, maybe more her family was like okay let's do it soon. And they're still going to have their like. Hopefully, like kind of dream wedding like they're doing it in the desert like outside of Vegas."
120.0,Provider,Oh Nice.

120.0,Provider,Is the baby i'm going to be out there very long.
1692.0,Patient,So i'm only going to be out there i'm flying and Saturday morning and i'm gonna fly out Sunday at noon so.
120.0,Provider,You can die and it's not that far from their. Work you get up early on Sunday. yeah there's sent me has anyone been to Vegas before.
1692.0,Patient,I have it.
120.0,Provider,"yeah Vegas is kind of creepy. creepy it's just like it's just like an adult amusement park there's like. I just I mean depends on what floats your boat but it's stuff I don't like really but there's a lot of good hiking around it, no."
1692.0,Patient,"that's yeah i'm really hoping that, like Sunday morning I could squeeze something. Because I really just like want to be out in the desert like I don't."
120.0,Provider,"Care what you do play at least fly out Sunday night, so that you can have at least part of the day. Because that's like such a fun area down there."
1692.0,Patient,yeah i've heard that it's really. it's really cool.
120.0,Provider,"But probably I don't know how you have to look at the map, I don't know it's probably like maybe a two hour drive to zions from Vegas so it's not that. I don't think you'd be pretty close if you wanted to do that Elsa get get like it's a lot and you're you're probably wanting to be with your brother and everything."
1692.0,Patient,yeah so.
120.0,Provider,that's cool though that's an exciting time for them sure.
1692.0,Patient,yeah I wish I could. I should ask my dad to just like yeah can we change my return flight to like Monday.
120.0,Provider,yeah I mean you look into it see what the cost would be cuz. yeah good to go to their very often you know.
1692.0,Patient,yeah yeah i've never been in Nevada before so.
120.0,Provider,"yeah. there's some there's some pretty areas there's there's a gorge right down through there that you go through when you're going through St when you go to St George, which is in southern utah through the gorge to Vegas. there's. three areas to their. own this year would be nice to do this. It will be as lasting hot like a traditional yes."
1692.0,Patient,that's cool yeah I have to look into that.
120.0,Provider,"Or you can even go to canal, they have. Can ab is in southern utah they have the world's largest animal sanctuary. They have like something like three or 4000 animals they're all different types of a bunch of the hurricane Katrina dogs, they have. Some I think the last Michael vick people that they had I think recently passed, but they can basically take a 22 of the dogs from that situation. And they have on most the animals they're like special needs in some way, and so I know it's kind of a cool kind of a cool thing. That is really cool you can go and go on the tour and stuff and they have a little gift shop, but she stuff that you know that all represent animals, and they have a. Beautiful cemetery of all the angels rest of where all the animals, they have, I think they have six or 7000 animals that are buried there. That they either died at the sanctuary or that people pay to have buried there and they have just beautifully done, and then they have like moon shines in every APP for every animal so it's just. A cool place to visit so that'd be a cool place to go to buy their. pink coral standards, which is a big. sandy, which is a big thing out here that's clear."
1692.0,Patient,that's cool yeah. So have to do some research.
120.0,Provider,"yeah yes, where you can do, while you're out there. I know. here. she's like I don't know where so. How are you feeling I mean say how you feel it outside of this thing with a dog, but I imagine that that is a pretty big thing to be like right now."
1692.0,Patient,"yeah I mean, otherwise I think i'm feeling pretty well. I like i'm trying to be more intentional with like reaching out to people. I just feel like the past week or two i've also just like not been trying very hard to like. I don't know I like. Think I have like. I think I do have like. A lot of social anxiety, but I think also like saying that gives me an excuse to like make it worse, and I should really just like confront it and, like reach out to people but."
120.0,Provider,Like.
1692.0,Patient,"I don't know so it's easy for me to like and, just like the past year, you know how people say like social skills are like a muscle, for us to use them."
120.0,Provider,yeah.
1692.0,Patient,But I don't know i'm just like definitely a pretty introverted person so like I don't tend to think about it too much until like i'm in a place where i'm like wow I.
120.0,Provider,haven't like anybody yeah.
1692.0,Patient,yeah so i'm just.
120.0,Provider,"Have it do you have any. Like friends that you feel. Like closer to where they might not know what's going on your life all the time, but then, when you do talk it's like you never were apart, you have any of those kinds of friends."
1692.0,Patient,"I do yeah like I have a couple of town here in a couple who have like are like an hour or two away or whatever it was just two former. But. yeah and I do have like a couple of close friends in town, who will hit now like you know but. yeah and it's just like a weird place to be like you know i'm in like a college town where and like there's a lot going on, like outside of the College like. realm. yeah in like matt is still kind of ingrained in that like not as much like we definitely friends who are like out of school and everything but. And he's like. Doing races, with the team this year and stuff because you guys will get something good out of like. Having classes again."
120.0,Provider,yeah i'll be involved in that for sure yeah.
1692.0,Patient,"But it's just like it's definitely. hard for me and like it's it's fine like he needs to do like what he needs to do but it's just like hard for me because, like those like we're my people and he's like in that circle and. I don't know."
120.0,Provider,"it's Jen. I mean, can you be involved to, or do you have to be a student."
1692.0,Patient,"yeah. So. And like i'm definitely finding other people outside of that. And, just like. Unlike coaching like the middle school kids which is like really fun. But. yeah it's hard because, like there's not a strong like running Community that's like not college age, but also not like you know, like 40s or 50s like there aren't many people in the middle, they usually move to like. Mid to large sized cities like."
120.0,Provider,You know.
1692.0,Patient,"And that's like just starting to realize that like after he graduates he'll be in a similar situation and he's like where should we move and i'm like I don't know, but we should move somewhere because it's hard to build a post Grad social life here. But. yeah I don't know so like just like trying to really like nurture the friendships that I have, I need to start focusing on doing that."
120.0,Provider,"yeah I know I know it's super hard to try to. You know figure out kind of your. Your role and things that's one of the reasons why I think animals are great Is that the kind of. You know kind of give you a community of people but also like animals, but you know cats are a little difficult it's not difficult a little different because they like being introverts. So they'll sit around with you all day, and you know not force you to get out like like you know dogs night, but if you. You know, maybe could find some people where you volunteer. At the shelter because there might be like minded people there."
1692.0,Patient,"yeah yeah I think something like that. And I really it's hard because, like not many places like i'd love to I do some like. Like frequent like yoga classes, or something and there seems to be like some really cool like crunchy yoga people in the area. But yeah so just trying to figure out like different ways to. do that because I also I quit at starbucks this weekend I was like. And I think I was just really overwhelmed and like I told them, I was like I can't work this weekend and. I was like well someone else called off so like you know and. I was just super overwhelmed but and it's been hard because there's been there's been like a lot going on, like during the weekends and like working during the week and then being there on the weekends."
120.0,Provider,Like.
1692.0,Patient,"yeah so it's just been a lot, I was like you can just take me off because. So."
120.0,Provider,yeah there any out. door stores are like rock climbing places where you live like or like rock gyms.
1692.0,Patient,they're they're actually are yeah one just opened.
120.0,Provider,"Because I bet you could get a job there, because those places are really fun usually and. Even if you started out just as a cleaning person or something and they teach you how to do everything. Unless you already know how to do, I mean I don't know much about it, but I know it's fun."
1692.0,Patient,yeah I do I do want to do more of that. Is it seems like there's really cool people there.
120.0,Provider,"yeah I think that that kind of your type of people probably that you know that you might be able to connect with and stuff I know like rock gyms are good. or fun for that kind of stuff and. or working at rei or one of the outdoors doors, if you guys have a stores like that around you. yeah because then you're going to meet people that are interested in that stuff and you know you can nerd out about it and then go to these little workshops about different types of you know. You know, recreational sports and stuff."
1692.0,Patient,yeah yeah that's a good point I should try to do I should try to look into that.
120.0,Provider,"it's not I mean if, especially if you need you know additional income, you know that's always a good thing to do, but if even just for the social part of it. could be beneficial to you."
1692.0,Patient,yeah yeah definitely. And I know i'm glad you mentioned that because I actually I went to the rock gym a couple weeks ago with like a friend and it's all that there's like a women's climbing coalition.
120.0,Provider,know you should.
1692.0,Patient,"yeah and I think I think one of the light group climb things this tonight, so I should ask her and be like yeah do you have to go to this because we were like saying, and I know she's really busy, and she like tends to over commit to a lot of things so. Yes, he's available but that'll be fun."
120.0,Provider,"Right, even if she can't do it do it take take the risk you're on your own. yeah show up you know, and this and then you know it just takes a few minutes to kind of you like i'm you, what are we doing today like what what's the process here and just kind of no it's so awkward but it I don't know, I think it would be an empowering experience."
1692.0,Patient,yeah yeah That would be a new fun.
120.0,Provider,"that's cool like you know if it costs money, or anything."
1692.0,Patient,"So it does cost money, the only thing with this rock gym like it's awesome and like I love it but it's also like. 19 or $20 per visit which is like rock gyms are expensive but."
120.0,Provider,"They have passes or it's like that, like really like them."
1692.0,Patient,"They do, and they do have this deal where you could pay for like a beginner class and then get two weeks, free and then it's buy one get one free. So I told matt that like after we both like do our marathons and we're taking a break, we should do like the two week free like rock climbing and on there. So. yeah. For sure, and I feel like it, I feel like it would be worth it like. I don't know it's a lot of money, but spending like $20 once or twice a month it's like."
120.0,Provider,"Okay it's when you. work hard for your money and it doesn't all have to be you know completely responsibilities, you know spent, it can be you know it's meant to be enjoyed to."
1692.0,Patient,"Sure, so. yeah."
120.0,Provider,"I think that those are some good ideas you know to to bring some you know, to introduce some more joy and positive. Positive feelings into your life yeah. Especially if there's a kind of a club that like that, like that's one thing that I always thought we fund to do, but I never really had anybody that aren't you know to do it with. And so I was like well if you got to have someone to play, you know if you go climb so like you kind of have to bring somebody with you i'm sure the employees there do that all the time, if I believe people that that are there um. You know, but I that was always one thing, but if they if. You. If they have like a coalition that you go together, that would be such a fun thing to have a shared hobby with people. I don't know, though I. Remember life feel like there's so many options and there's another feels like you feel stuck the same time yeah. Like so many things to do, but then feeling like not having a lot of. Choices or what you give it but."
1692.0,Patient,yeah it's what it's like decision paralysis or something like.
120.0,Provider,yeah our decision fatigue. yeah yeah where you're like there's so many things I don't even know what to do right is kind of sit here.
1692.0,Patient,"yeah it's like hard, if you like, want to optimize and choose like the best possible one, but like you just don't know."
120.0,Provider,"yeah I mean truthfully there isn't an optimal thing you know, like. it's kind of like well i'm not gonna wait until i'm good at something to do i'm not going to wait until I really know I want to do it to do it. i'm gonna try it and if it doesn't work, then I learned that you know, like what the puppy you know i'm so proud of you for having tried that. You know that's a huge a huge risk and it ended up being a good thing you, you know you got to have the experience and you know they got their puppy back, which is kind of what they wanted anyway. It sounds like and um and you know you kind of got the experience of you know, having a newborn basically and what that would be like, and you know kind of gives you a better idea of what. What needs to be in place down the road for when you feel like you can take that on again."
1692.0,Patient,"yeah for sure, I think that it gets yeah I gave that I love to talk about like with just that whole process and, like how you know, in the future, like we'd want to have like certain like a lot of the same things in place and like different things and blitz to and. So."
120.0,Provider,"that's best friends animal sanctuary in in southern utah. um they one of the things you can do if you stay that if you go there is, you can stay in their housing, they have these cabins and you can take an animal with you for on a sleep over. So. They encourage you to do that, and because of. The animals more adoptable. To give them experiences away from the shelter, so they can get to they don't have a car park every time they have to leave yeah. So I don't know, I was that that would be an interesting and you can even get like a pig with you."
1692.0,Patient,yeah that's cool.
120.0,Provider,But. yeah. going. Here did did the weekend kind of take up all of your emotional energies where you didn't think about how much I don't know.
1692.0,Patient,"yeah I think it was all right um and yeah that was just like. yeah it was it was Okay, like, I think, Monday Sunday and Monday food was just like really hard. And it was like interesting to realize that's like and I shouldn't be surprised I was like oh wow This is something that I still like. fall back on if i'm like shit so that was. funny to realize. and yeah I don't know and it kind of sucks it's like I did a long run on Sunday, and so I should have been eating a ton and I just like felt totally sick and then like I would eat a little bit be like oh wait i'm starving and then he but then feel like totally sick again at."
120.0,Provider,The beginning yeah.
1692.0,Patient,"Just like the whole thing but yeah it's definitely gotten better and I had to like reason with myself and like make sure that I got back on the. tracks, but yeah it's it's gotten better so that, just like threw me off a little bit, but it's also nice to like see throughout those couple of days when. We were like super super busy, and like I wasn't sleeping very much and stuff I like eight whatever what was available, which was like really scary but like also I wasn't like micromanaging."
120.0,Provider,"And you were okay your body's okay. Well, did not end. You know i'm. That video I showed you about the backwards bicycle. yeah and how the guys trying to train themselves to learn to to you know switch his his neural pathways so that he can write it, you know, in a way that's know. That he can learn a new way of writing and I remember the one part, where he's what he finally figured it out. And he can read it pretty consistently without crashing but he said that whenever there's a distraction like If so, if my cell phone rings or my kid is like hey dad or something like that, then he kind of like if he's not focusing on it he'll kind of get distracted and crash. And it's interesting how the the thing with the puppy Maybe it was kind of like a distraction to where you're like oh wow I need to. recognize that when when i'm under additional stress, such as what the puppy or maybe start a new job or you know if you having a fight with somebody at any kind anytime there's some kind of you know. You know stress beyond the norm, you know but makes you a little bit more at risk for falling off the horse kind of the idea of you know sticking to you know consistent eating and and challenging your negative mind so that you're not beating yourself up and. That kind of thing. Because you because, like. You said that it was kind of surprising that how that came back you know some of that negative self talk and stuff was still there, it just you know because it when he had the opportunity, when you when you will feeling like a failure, like you said you were feeling guilty. Then that just starts that process in motion of your negative thoughts."
1692.0,Patient,yeah for sure.
120.0,Provider,"So after it's been a couple of days, are you still in that place of feeling like you're bad or that you're not enough or that you failed that kind of now, you still letting that narrative play over and over are you trying to work on like forgiveness and learning from something. Moving forward that kind of thing."
1692.0,Patient,yeah yeah I think today i'm definitely in that place where like it's funny I almost feel like I should still be like feeling bad and beating myself up but yeah I mean i'm feeling like better. yeah so.
120.0,Provider,"yeah that i'm glad i'm glad that is. Instead of like a free fall into darkness, it was a free fall for a couple of days. You know, but it's kind of slowing down now and you're. The bungee is catching yeah maybe so that you're not like. But you're it's keeping you from going too far."
1692.0,Patient,"yeah for sure, like Monday I was scared I was like is my mental health just kind of like plummet for a while. Because like I could like see that happening and I like try it, I felt like I was just like doggy paddling my entire way through Monday, just like trying not to like. Get too bad. And yeah I reached out to some friends yesterday to. You know, like try. To meet up and stuff like that. yeah so that made me feel a lot better and just like being a practice like with the kids and stuff yesterday. As always, really fun so."
120.0,Provider,"yeah good good that's that's awesome to kind of you know. go back to what you know, has helped in the past. You know you're. having a hard time this to kind of default to. know, two things that. are going to be really some of the negative feelings, instead of just sitting there and swimming around in it."
1692.0,Patient,yeah.
120.0,Provider,"The doggy paddle is a good as a good description of just like doggy paddling around in your craft. Instead of like I need to like get out of this pool of crabbing know practice self forgiveness and be like it's I mean. it's okay doesn't it's not. You know that that people you don't know what you don't know you know, like you, didn't know what this experience is going to be like you didn't know how anxious that puppy was going to be. You know, to where it was you know kind of so disruptive and. yeah. You got it wasn't a human child that's really hard to say nevermind you know."
1692.0,Patient,"that's that's what matt and I were talking about, we were like oh my God. How do people do this like. And I know that they're like preparing we're talking about that, last night, like people who find themselves in a circumstance, where they're going to be having a child and they weren't planning for it like. Oh man I people get through it, but."
120.0,Provider,"You, but they have to grow up really quick like you don't get to think about you anymore you don't eat constantly. My my my my sister in law they had their first baby, they were she's like my whole my whole life right now is my boob his mouth and his but that's what we do we just. Like I just feed them and clean up and eat everything is like that's what we do and you know, for a long time it takes, you know, a long time and with a puppy is very similar, but with a human child you can't you can't put them in a CRATE and try to ignore them, you have to. You know so it's okay to recognize that you're not ready for that."
1692.0,Patient,"yeah for sure, and it gives me like we were talking about it last night to like it just gives us so much respect for like his older sister their their child is I guess he's like 14 months now, and like my brother, they just had their child. I guess he's two months old now."
120.0,Provider,This is what it's getting married.

120.0,Provider,Your cloud like it's been like.
1692.0,Patient,"yeah and she's been like really protective of the baby, but at first molly was worried that like she'd like accidentally like jump on or whatever, because she's just like a very jumpy like stressed out high strung dog. She has a lot on her plate we're just talking about that, like How are they doing that and how is molly doing that well my brother is at work like. Oh. that's a lot."
120.0,Provider,"wow. that's that was. I don't know if it was intended or not, but the the timing of getting a young dog that's a high energy dog and and having a baby is probably less than ideal."
1692.0,Patient,"yeah yeah. I agree, and I think like their dog is just getting more stressed out because she's not able to go out as much because it's not like molly can walk the dog and the baby, the same time and."
120.0,Provider,"Well, those kind of dogs, I mean they're they're bred to run hundreds of miles pointed sled you know that's what they're designed to do and. They are often there's a lot of huskies at the shelter because they just are hard dogs, I have one of my friends lives up the road, she has a Arctic breed rescue, but she does dog sledding. In the winter. And the summer, she has this cart with the dogs pull trigger on trails and she just let's let this run and she runs alongside of them and rides on the things sometimes and then jobs and i'm right on the thing. The dogs pull it and then some of the dogs just run alongside with the older dogs and then in the winter is you pull sleds and so she was up in the trenches a lot to go sledding but the dogs and then they have a little business where they take people a dog sled rides. Oh, a money to go on a dog sled right. and actually Alaska and stuff I did her odd kind of stuff and those dogs like when people say that you know there's always kind of people that are like. proponents of the dog should never be left out in the cold and that in that that should be people should get ticketed for that and things like that, but like those dogs, they need to be in that in that situation that's what they're bred for him."
1692.0,Patient,yeah.
120.0,Provider,"It will be very unhappy being kept in a you know, in a situation where they you know don't get to get out as much."
1692.0,Patient,yeah for sure.
120.0,Provider,"yeah most most dogs when given the choice with my trial they outside, even if you're covered in stone, then that's what they like so it's. it's it's hard, I mean I always think of my dogs are pretty amazing as far as how they adapt to the human world."
1692.0,Patient,yeah.
120.0,Provider,"But that's hard, though, for your sister in law."
1692.0,Patient,"yeah yeah it is, it is really tough so and like they really should hire just like a dog Walker to come, like, especially at the stage and, like the baby's life like it's so hard for to balance that like someone could just come in, like bring their pop out for a while."
120.0,Provider,yeah.

Think they're gone for like three or four days and she just like would not eat was constantly doing like start."
120.0,Provider,"The enterprise I didn't give her some meds for that, because you can give meds for dogs for that, but. yeah that is tough."

120.0,Provider,"Go on, let them go out of town for a couple days and get a break and then he can go. dog sit and get your dog phil and.

But it's still you know, probably worth asking."
