11869.0,Patient,hey Andrea good morning.
527.0,Provider,hi Sebastian how are you.
11869.0,Patient,"How are you hey can I in the room next door in the office, I heard like a lot of being looked at sounds like something like felt, can I just check on my colleagues real quick."
527.0,Provider,hey yeah hey yeah.
11869.0,Patient,Life along. All right.
527.0,Provider,There again.
11869.0,Patient,spilled water on a laptop.
527.0,Provider,Oh yeah.
11869.0,Patient,"Like fell on them, or something. yeah I was like shoot out there."
527.0,Provider,hey how are you doing.
11869.0,Patient,"we're good you know thanks actually a great I mean i'm i'm trying to like i'm To be honest, it felt a little bit awkward being at the group session on Tuesday, because it's like in like kind of like a theme, or like um it just feels like. I don't know I mean. I don't want to jinx myself here, but like. Okay it's been like it's been like. I just feel bad being the one that doesn't have negative things to bring to the table."
527.0,Provider,Okay.
11869.0,Patient,"Everyone has like and and and and part of me feels kind of like. You know, like others must think like okay Fuck this kid like nothing's wrong with it, or at least like and it's and it's part of me is like okay so bashing like Am I not sharing my not really like Am I not like willing to. To kind of like really talk about stuff and open up with others, is that what's wrong, but then I really started thinking i'm like no honestly there's really not like there's not like bad stuff going on right now, like overall like i'm a happy person like. You know my life really has turned around in the last three or four months for the better. You know i've actually got a routine going on, like. showing up at the office between like, eight and nine, if not sometimes earlier sometimes. Sure, like you know, like feel pretty fulfilled throughout the day I mean the worst thing that's happened to me recently is like on Tuesday my my E bike almost got stolen I like I like saw that happen and i'm like."
527.0,Provider,Oh no no.
11869.0,Patient,"that's The worst thing and and so so have been feeling kind of like. A little bit like the minority at the at the clinic sections, a little bit because. it's always like you know julie's amazing I really like her she's like she she does a great job with the group sessions, but you know she she wants everyone to participate, which is. Tangible you know to just make the whole session engaging and all that, but you know, every time it's my turn it's like. It almost feels like it's getting to a point where it feels like almost have to like make some stuff up about like that's potentially negative or like depressive. I like that. Guy just because I feel like i'm like. Like I don't know, I feel, like the rest of the people must be like okay why the hell is this kid even here kind of thing."
527.0,Provider,OK OK.
11869.0,Patient,I mean i'm just being honest it's a little bit.
527.0,Provider,"Sure yeah. What cuz I know we moved our appointments to just once a month check in because. Which to. Which yeah and for like 30 minutes to check, in just to stay on top of things, and you know have that little piece of accountability, but. What about talking when do you see tanya again as far as I was looking to see it looks like you see her on the seventh. Yes, I can certainly send her a message with along with Julie. To see you know, because what are you doing, are you doing twice a month groups. Yes, three are still. yeah okay."
11869.0,Patient,"yeah yeah I think that's a great idea I mean don't get me wrong, I I i've appreciated the group sessions and."
527.0,Provider,Especially the beginning of the show really.
11869.0,Patient,"helpful, especially during like the transition but. Maybe this is something that I could have brought up with tanya at my last one on one with her, which was probably. Almost three weeks ago now. But, but like it started being more of a theme right around that meeting, I think that I had with tanya, so I think it was too early for me to like."
527.0,Provider,"sure. that's fine I mean this is how you're feeling right now so we'll certainly you know i'll shoot him i'll shoot him an email and say you know at you know here's here's his thoughts and feelings about Group and You know he's benefiting but at the same time, you know not feeling as connected, and so you know, is there a potential to drop him to once a month group. You know, reduce the frequency of group of group session so yeah i'll certainly bring it to their attention for you i'm gonna make a note to myself to do that."
11869.0,Patient,"I mean yeah I appreciate, I mean, however, however, you think it's best or or if we should wait until like I have a one on one with tanya but I mean it's it's something that's been kind of like coming up over and over at group sessions, but. game, it became especially clear on Tuesday, when I had my last one. yeah um and and it became especially clear, because when it was my turn to talk, you know I mean I was just very truthful I was like you know, this is what my week has been like and. let's see I think I deleted the link, but she shared this link with us about. Being might have like took a screenshot look at me. yeah okay so. um I shoot well I don't know what the title of the thing was because I didn't capture that in my screenshot but it's like. Basically it's like all of these like negative thoughts that you can have in your head like filtering you take the negative details and magnify them while filtering out all the positive aspects of the situation polarized thinking. Things that are black and white good or bad. You have to be perfect or you're a failure there's no middle ground. overgeneralization you come to general conclusions based on a single incident or. Evidence so anyways we were kind of like going through all of these categories and trying to see like you know which ones were. Like we would connect with the most and ensure like that exercise like was was like hit home a little bit because I related with some of them, but I just feel like i'm in a different place like a very, very different place than pretty much everyone. Sure actually not even pretty much like i'm confident saying everyone in that group so. yeah I it just it just doesn't feel like the right place for me."
527.0,Provider,Okay sure.
11869.0,Patient,"So so yeah. You know if reducing to once once once once a month or or or even just sticking to. Like individual sessions with you on a on a monthly basis, which I do appreciate like you said for accountability like who knows, maybe like something could come up like I don't know, maybe a fight with my family or. Like whatever yeah yeah work, I mean I don't know, whatever it can be so. that's nice, but the. um. I think the group sessions are a little bit overkill and yeah they're just not yeah. Not uh. yeah they've just been making me like feel kind of like weird about."
527.0,Provider,Like how how well you're doing.
11869.0,Patient,"yeah compared to a little it just it puts me in like a weird place and I feel like i'm not adding value to the group, if anything, i'm like maybe pissing off some people and I don't think i'm necessarily pissing people off, but they must be thinking like. Why is he here. yeah sure i'm not sure yeah I don't know, I think. i'm pretty sure tanya would agree with me."
527.0,Provider,"Well, and that's you know, one of the things when I reached out to her as far as being able to move our sessions to once a month. You know, and she was comfortable with doing that because she you know she said, things are stable your medication stable, you know, and that, and that was fine with her, she she agreed that that we can drop that. The other thing too is, I know bright heart is that you know the groups are part of. Part of the program and and I certainly hear you Sebastian cuz you're not the first person that's come to me is like oh I don't like these groups like, can I just do. Individual sessions and and you know my medication appointments and and I wish that could be true. You know I wish that was the way the program works, but unfortunately they have the groups as part of the requirements, but I certainly a talking with tanya you know, is it something that. You know, do we need to look at an outside referral for you just for the medication piece, I mean, do you really you know again you're doing well with therapy piece. You know, but is, is it more of just an ongoing medication management for you like long term and so is that something that you maybe need to talk with her about as far as you know, is, is there a way to transition to. An outside provider just for medication management long term I you know, because some people do that you know they. They meet the goals of the program and or they just want to do medication management, and so, then we you know can certainly give some referrals for outside providers. To get connected with to do either and and different therapies, you know, some people move to you know more specialty therapy provider, you know whether trauma or whatever, and so you know that might be a good discussion for her as well, as you know, are there other options. Can she override the group I don't know I mean but. That would be you know you can certainly ask her. You know."
11869.0,Patient,"I appreciate all that all those are. Good or good or good thoughts good considerations I yeah I mean I welcome all of those I mean I remember, I remember a long time ago, I had. I don't think I stood up asked like hey is there an option not to do the group sessions I don't think that was my question because I genuinely did enjoy the group sessions like before like they. actually helped me I just feel like i'm at a point now where they're not helping me and it's. And it's not only not the best use of my time, but it's also like not the best use of I think their time so. So that's why I think that maybe some adjusting That would be good."
527.0,Provider,"yeah yeah definitely, so I will send them an email and just kind of let. them know and then awesome let john you know that you've. are probably going to address some other individual questions for her your next appointment with her as well, so just to kind of give her a heads up."
11869.0,Patient,Okay yeah. I think what was I gonna say sorry someone like stepped in so. i've got distracted driving a little bit.
527.0,Provider,yeah.
11869.0,Patient,i'm gonna say i'm sure it lost my train of thought.
527.0,Provider,will tell me what's going well.
11869.0,Patient,"yeah Oh well. No quickly I OK, I yeah I had mentioned will tanya I think like back in the day long time had mentioned. Like I can remember what I said, but it was maybe like hinting at like exploring like less group sessions, and she said that uh that. or no, I had said I can't remember, but basically she made me. Understand that, like the group sessions were like very, very important, and like a requirement so but I mean she did decrease me from weekly to bi weekly two times per month or sorry bi monthly or whatever the term is."
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
11869.0,Patient,"So. yeah, and I mean I don't know I don't want to shoot myself in the foot, maybe, maybe, maybe. Maybe something terrible in my life will happen that'll be very grateful to like."
527.0,Provider,"Hopefully, not yeah exactly."
11869.0,Patient,"But I don't know what's going well in my life as a lot of things are going well, like. I like kind of just recently. um. mustered up the like, not the courage, but like I guess the like will to like maybe get myself out there and like you know explore dating again. as well. So that's been cool. I actually went on a date on a Tuesday."
527.0,Provider,Okay.
11869.0,Patient,"Which is when my, which is one of my bike freaking got attempted to be stolen. So I get off of work super excited to like meet this girl like 45 minutes later so i'm like bolting out the like. office building and I get to my bike and and the lock is jammed so for like 20 minutes and fiddling with it, and I cannot get the key in it. So, finally, like I call a family contractor. And it's a brand new lock like it works super well, like the key is very smooth like everything works well, so i'm like super confused call a family contractor. contractor asks me at does the key going all the way, tell them no that's the issue and he's like oh very simple somebody tried to jack your bike today. And they put like a lock picking mechanism that unfortunately got stuck in your lock so they were unsuccessful so that's why your key doesn't fit all the way and i'm like are you fucking kidding me. And, and that was the case but anyways this girl she came from she came from oakland which is across the bay bridge in San Francisco so it's like a 30 minute drive. She went her way. And I was like. I was not going to be where I told her I would be at the time we agreed, so I call her, and I feel bad because she's like she's doing the drive to me like. Okay 40 minute drive to me. And i'm basically dealing with this like big problem, and I wanted to kind of resolve it, I didn't want to leave my bike or overnight. Share expensive a bike and. yeah he would steal it overnight. Yes, she was super patient she's like don't worry, because we were going to do, like a dog date thing I have a German shepherd she has. yeah retriever. We were gonna do like a big like a dog hike or something, and she was super patient she was like don't worry, like all hang out with you and your dog and we'll figure out your bike and. And then, like that took a while it took up most of the time, but then, but then after we like managed to get dinner, and like it was good, but it was a series that was that was a positive. And negative the negative yeah."
527.0,Provider,"Other than yeah yeah so did you get your bike figured out, then."
11869.0,Patient,"yeah I guess what yesterday I did so that happened on Tuesday and yesterday and well, we had to, we have to bust out the electric grinder and saw open the. lock, because the law. Was compromised so but um but um but no yeah I mean it's a good let's see. Things are good i'm like we're doing like a lot of progress at works i'm pretty proud of like what i've been able to like contribute. yeah actually right now we're in like our separate conference room and we set up this this like little filming wall we're going to. yeah like abroad, like my big backpack with all my camera equipment. My tripod over there. yeah and we're gonna be doing we're going to be filming some like. So I work at a venture capital fund, and we are going to be creating this like university portion of our website for startup founders, and for them to have like resources. So we're going to be kind of filming some content and talking about kind of frequently asked stuff so that they can kind of refer to that and. And okay rely on us less so that's a big project today. yeah yeah like things are things are going well, like we're. and I don't know I feel like i've been i've been eating well too i've been i've been working out, you know. Frequently. i'm doing so much every day that i'm like exhausted at. Night pretty well."
527.0,Provider,Good good. yeah.
11869.0,Patient,I think I feel pretty balanced I don't know. Good um.
527.0,Provider,"So what was it like going on a date because I know it's been a while, how did you feel just within yourself, because I know you've also been you know, working on just confidence within yourself and being more attentive to your needs and feelings and things."
11869.0,Patient,"yeah yeah no that's a really good question, I appreciate that. um. So the confidence for sure, has been helped tremendously by the medication as well right, I think that those two definitely. Being able to like actively listen to someone and like actually engage in a conversation and remembering what they're saying. Being like distracted when someone's talking to me. And just being more present in general, which is what the medication is really has allowed me to to do is, I felt like I was never really part of society before and like now like. wow yeah well like I mean I know sounds kind of extreme but like it. kind of is like I just felt very like."
527.0,Provider,kind of just disconnected.
11869.0,Patient,"yeah just not as capable as others I just like felt like not not on the same page as others. And, but but, but I really I much more now than I ever have. So, so that has given me like so much more confidence and and yeah my family's noticed. My close friends have noticed, you know my colleagues at work have noticed. So obviously I feel more secure, maybe I don't."
527.0,Provider,Know yeah and.
11869.0,Patient,"And so, so, so I think that got. transmitted during the date, and I think that also gets felt by like others when they interact with me, Sir, the date one well, I think. i'm not sure if i'm like into her completely but. Right um but she's super super sweet she's like really nice. yeah, so I think I think it might be more of a friend thing. and Her dog and my dog really get along and and, and I mean we matched on like the bumble APP so. Like I was initially attracted to her and sharing and you know I think she might have been also so and then so we matched and then but I thought it would be great regardless to meet because see if there's something, and also for the box together."
527.0,Provider,"yeah yeah well I think it's just again kind of getting back to just normal social activities for you to like you know connecting with people. And you feel you're feeling more confident, to again like you said just be able to hold a conversation and be attentive and listening and. Just. You know feeling more comfortable with who you are now like. You can be more genuine with yourself to."
11869.0,Patient,yeah it definitely feels. really good to kind of be just like sharper I don't know.
527.0,Provider,it's like.
11869.0,Patient,I don't know how to really discarded that's just quicker sharper. I was just like really slow before really slow and a hard time. yeah just remembering what people would tell me when they would talk to me.
527.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
11869.0,Patient,Your role I didn't feel like I functions correctly.
527.0,Provider,"Sure well i'm probably just kind of fumbled through you know conversations and trying to put your words and thoughts together because they're going this way, and you know, a mile a minute and trying to slow things down to think about you know and then somebody is already on to the next. You know, part of the conversation and you're like wait a minute i'm back here still trying to. Trying to play catch up and. So yeah."
11869.0,Patient,"And then so many times like people would like either be kind of like nice about it, or sometimes really rude about it, and you know they kind of make me feel like Okay, are you done like. All right, you already talked about this like. Like, why are you asking this again, so I don't know it's been like it's been that's why I think I was like in the place, I was like three and a half, four months ago, or. Whenever there was. Because I was Maybe you can call it some form of depression, but like yeah we're really was not super happy with myself. yeah um but uh but uh but yeah it's like insane like we're like where i've."
527.0,Provider,Where I am yeah yeah exactly. yeah great great.

11869.0,Patient,"yeah no. Thank you for asking it's so much better like it's so much better, I mean i'm not i'm not doing any any crazy activity, because. I know that um yeah in the last three months also like yeah two and a half, three months. i've re injured myself re injured my back like at least twice, maybe even three times, so I just know it's like delicate and I can't. can't be too crazy so. yeah when I bend down for any reason i'm like pretty careful about it, I try to avoid lifting heavy objects like at all. Because that is what really messes me up. And yeah. had an MRI done probably close to two months ago now. Okay, and they saw like a couple concerning things but they're like it's not the end of the world, and you most likely won't need surgery but we'd like to get a second opinion from the ortho department oh he's scheduled me for January, like. And wow I was done like."
527.0,Provider,Six weeks ago. it's gonna say yeah so.
11869.0,Patient,"wow yeah whatever, at least at least. Probably nothing there but uh. But they're just a second opinion Sharon. But no, I think I. Think what else is exciting that I or not, but I can share."

11869.0,Patient,"Okay okay yeah I appreciate that and I think yeah also I don't know if it was like a miscommunication or something, but when tanya moved me to two times per month. You know and and I confirm this with. In an email with her after because I kind of got in trouble with like scheduling because to. me okay we're. moving into two times per month and part of the reason for that was just because, like, I think, with work, it was getting kind of complicated to juggle both also and I was. Finding conflicting work meetings at the same time, so I had to like so Hannah said, you have to attend twice per month, so just whatever whatever two times per month, you want just to just the requirement is two times per month, so we don't. So I said okay and but then I kind of got in trouble with like the scheduling people they said Okay, like you, didn't show up what's going on, I was like. Well, no, my chart should have been updated tanya said twice per month, and she said, whatever whatever two times per month I wanted and they're like Okay, well, it doesn't really work that way. So then, so, then I copied. Like scheduling person with tanya on the same email and we got some clarity and. Okay, good."
527.0,Provider,Okay.
11869.0,Patient,"Good yeah so already I already figured that I would tanya and tanya said. that she was like i'm not sure why that happened that was not supposed to happen you're good you're definitely two times per month, so not sure why there was that hiccup might just be like a system issue whatever. But um but yeah I cleared that out with her and then we're good."
527.0,Provider,"Good good deal. All right. Well, you take care, it was good senior Sebastian and sorry about the other day yeah I saw you canceled so I was like I was off doing something else i'm like."
11869.0,Patient,"Oh yeah. yeah here was that, too, I was like. yeah I can't I can't."
