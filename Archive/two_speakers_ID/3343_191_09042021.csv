3343.0,Patient,"I do, I have one."
191.0,Provider,"So I would recommend that you wait to your. sicker. I usually try to start you if you start it now. you're sort of in a mild withdraw. Okay, now, you can see, we can. See how your body will respond. If you wanted to take a little piece of this amongst just a little. If you cut it in fours and you take a quarter. See how you feel or you can wait a little while. You can start to suboxone at a lower dose and just work it up, so that we can."
3343.0,Patient,Tell them.
191.0,Provider,Go ahead and help them i'm right here. They sound super cute. How old are there.
3343.0,Patient,Are six.

3343.0,Patient,Understanding yeah not at all that's my I think they put in another refill I didn't even pick it up.
191.0,Provider,"Not effective so patient is not taking. Alright, so we're going to take that one off, I think you have to prescriptions in there. And we'll clean it up so let's look at what does we're going to clean up what does not work and we're going to try to get an understanding of what does work OK and i'm going to recheck you and see when we can get this picture suboxone going okay. we'll go we'll go back over, even if I have to call you back in like 30 minutes to an hour walk you through how to take it, and everything okay. Is that okay with you."
3343.0,Patient,To take some suboxone again.
191.0,Provider,"yeah if you want to wait, if you give it about an hour to your cow score should go up all right it'll go up. And even if you take a lower dose like, if you take half of film. and wait and see how you do, because the way to precipitate a withdrawal happens in one way is to try to lessen, that is, if you take a little piece of quarter of the strip put it under your tongue see how you feel if you talk tolerate that. and You can go ahead and take another quarter strip about an hour later okay. Right and then, if you still not having any problems, then. You work it up and then you get back on your one strip three times a day, and we can walk through it together if you want okay. Right. A couple of things that let's look here. Are you taking the clonidine clo and I di n E, are you taking that."
3343.0,Patient,And what does that far.

3343.0,Patient,Did he just put it in I think he just put it in it.
191.0,Provider,And he did his for your withdrawal symptoms.
3343.0,Patient,"Okay, because when I come, yesterday I asked what it was Horn, they said oh just for your blood pressure, I said, well, I don't have high blood pressure."
191.0,Provider,"It to do that too, but it's for withdraw, sometimes it can help pick some people with anxiety. Some even have some people feel like they're going to sleep at night to make your fatigue to sleep at night, so this kind of takes the edge off things, and so you do have have that and that's something to look at taken to okay. let's see you have a dancer tron that's for your nazia do you do, you still have that or you're done with that."
3343.0,Patient,I don't have that I would actually like to have that.

I do count your medicines and we do other work ups for reason for pain okay. So it's not just calm get appeal is Tom. address the pain look at other causes for the pain. Work with your primary care provider to get the pain to take care of the pain. So if that's something you want us to do. You know, we talked about pain management. Okay i'll be happy to. meet with you and I know there's a lot of things going on, so what you and I can do is, we can meet and talk about that sounds like today, our main reason for meeting is the mental health.

Over the last two weeks How often have you felt nervous anxious around ah, you say it nearly every day. Over the last two weeks How often have you not been able to stop a control worrying you say it nearly every day. So it's 21 that's pretty severe. Do you agree with that. So we've got some severe depression severe anxiety and you know something. we've had that before. And we've been able to work together, I don't want you to feel like. This is a bad thing, but this just gives us something to work on okay. Have you ever been on medicines for anxiety or depression that has worked for you."
3343.0,Patient,know. what it was like 99 Hannah. Panic attacks and. I was in the hospital for a little bit they put me on. I think it's called the red hand.
191.0,Provider,"write this out of band Essen are a few that so. What we're trying with kind of think about medicines that. won't be as addictive that we can't get you off and that long term could have different. negative side effects and interactions with the buprenorphine in terms of increasing your risk of overdose depending on the amount, especially does anxiety or depression running your family. Yes, has any is there any medicines that your mother or father or sister or anyone close you ever been on."
3343.0,Patient,"Have you heard anyone, yes, but I don't know what it was."

3343.0,Patient,Probably yeah.
191.0,Provider,"So what I like to do this angel less less work on getting you back on your buprenorphine the locks on there when you're on that and you're taking that every day is your anxiety and depression better. Okay. um let me ask you this, have you ever been on something to help you sleep like a treasure doll."

3343.0,Patient,"I don't know why it sounds familiar. Okay, and I don't think I. don't think it works, I think that's another one. That I didn't help you sleep. No, it didn't help me do anything. Okay, because I she told me because i'm when I asked her, she said, given them like to get into your system, and I did, and then the next one, she felt I said i'm like I will take that because there was just so much that she was giving me that. wasn't working it was just an overload and I just stopped taking it all."
191.0,Provider,"Okay, all right and that's not how I practice, so I definitely respect your opinion because guess what before I was a physician I had docs try to do that very same thing to me and it frustrated me to know it. So this is where we are okay, we need to spend more time talking i've got another patient comment. And we need to try to understand what's going on one. Okay, so with insomnia, are you do you how much caffeine, do you take."
3343.0,Patient,"Usually it's water, maybe Maybe you can accommodate maybe."

191.0,Provider,Okay who's your therapist.
3343.0,Patient,I haven't seen one yet okay.

3343.0,Patient,I think i'm so used to it that no I. Just is in my system.
191.0,Provider,Just not in your system to.
3343.0,Patient,pick one i'm just i'm just saying like if I think what in the morning evening and night it doesn't make me feel any different. It doesn't make me any more sleepy I should say.
191.0,Provider,"and mechanics if you're all right, so I tell you what we're gonna do this is the plan for now and i'm gonna follow you closely okay. I want to follow you closely because we got to work out what works for you. So I want you to find out your mom's me it's now we can start our own this okay. And I will start minutes low. And we will go slow and we'll do one, at a time okay. So we can see what works and what doesn't work for you all right. And I won't start yet high doses.

3343.0,Patient,Okay.
191.0,Provider,"I don't think we have to start anything today and i'll tell you why. you're going through withdrawals So if you start the butte but your suboxone that's going to help. And if you start that clonidine if you take a tablet at night. Now, everyone is different. So I don't know how it's going to make you feel Okay, but what i've had some people say they're shaking they feel like this with the withdrawals when they start them out, since they feel better. That clonidine actually helped some people kind of calm down to. let's see how that works if that doesn't work will clean up the MID list like we just see it, we will talk about what we believe could work for you. The potential benefits. And what could not, I do want you to think a little bit more about the. travel down. The other medicine, we can think about taking that may help with pain depression. And insomnia, is amitriptyline. Have you ever taken amitriptyline. yeah did that work for you. Okay. All right, you see we're taking a town of fan I what works and what doesn't work okay. All right, they're not effective so we've got a couple of things now amitriptyline not effective trezza don't not effective lexapro not effective abuse bar not effective, is there anything else, we need to add to that list."
