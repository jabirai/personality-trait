You know, like you've. coped with all of that, and just so much of a healthier way and."
9386.0,Patient,"yeah yeah and it like. surgery. You know, really bothered me for a while, because I. came off of and they gave me pain medication, but being on the pain medication was such a reminder of how much I didn't like it, how much how bad I felt, and so I was ready to get back on suboxone so. While I was mad and upset because they did that to me, I was kind of glad to because it was a reminder of how reality and, for me, I felt on pain medication, and so it was a good, it was you know, I was upset because I, you know felt like. That was."
304.0,Provider,they've given you pain medications and you didn't know it.
9386.0,Patient,"know that so after surgery that had me off completely off the box and right before my surgery, and they gave me a pain medication for the first week after I had my surgery and. I. took it for like three days, and then I was like you know what I feel like trash ridiculous, and so I will read it for. us. I got rid of, I thought I flushed down the toilet yeah you know the name, you know, maybe, maybe fill that. Not me, and it was a good reminder."
304.0,Provider,yeah I mean it has its purpose but yeah I mean you don't want to.
9386.0,Patient,"Go and an IRA now you have time know you have surgery have something, but you know, I was thinking you know, every day, many times a day and. that's."
304.0,Provider,Not hopefully they didn't give you a huge prescription.
9386.0,Patient,"Anyway, no, no. Like enough for. I think I wait for a week like enough for a week for do like a post up, we can set and I didn't ask for any more. Get rid of their a."

9386.0,Patient,"And my husband has hydrocodone I don't even care of us to keep us in the lockbox because I want to, but now it's the sun and then in the bathroom I don't care. So."
304.0,Provider,that's huge dream is he.
9386.0,Patient,"Because before i've taken all his Oliver. I didn't have with my pain, I had taken it for so long and it wasn't doing anything but you know."
304.0,Provider,yeah like I think it does yeah the psychological.
9386.0,Patient,"yeah exactly it was a bizarre because. When I was you know surgery. And then do for my thing you know and. Excellent i'm so suboxone have my chronic pain, but the pain medication."
304.0,Provider,yeah.
9386.0,Patient,that's usually the reason why am I picking my nose i'm hurting anybody else.
304.0,Provider,"And so, and that's been feeling yeah just reason enough right there to just kind of you know if you if you taper down, but just to kind of stay on that low dose you know. So."
9386.0,Patient,"yeah yeah. But I I do a lot of. You know the group and things like that. was another guy does. qualify for recovery he's actually out of Canada, but he gave me a workbook and I both he published a book and workbook. The variety workbook and it's got a lot of. Good things and lessons and stuff and I worked on that. So I just you know do different things I eventually would like to have other people, because there are a lot of people that have the same issue, as I do, but you know and and I see that now, you know. it's all over. And like after I had my degree I can't tell you about the people that are like upstanding citizen, but reach out to me and I thought I had prepared, you know and like you know i've been there i've been that same person that would ask people what they have for pain medication. You know it's easily easily done fortunately back and give it up, you know some doctors give it that they're cracking down on that far but."
304.0,Provider,You know.
9386.0,Patient,"Some people have the same old family doctor but give them 100 on a high Dakota amongst them, you know."
304.0,Provider,"Oh, my gosh."
9386.0,Patient,"They were 2325 a month. And nothing I want the pain doctor. supposed to be the best pain doctor in Columbia Missouri and that was during COPA de de talk to me through my car window I know some those those me. He gave me 100 putting Africa for several months, and then he went to put the final simulator my back and i've heard terrible reviews and I said no i'm not doing that and so i'm not prescribing not Okay, but i'm doing that because I think it's an insurance game if. They put they put those in their back and then I have to because anytime you needed the justice or it's not working, they get to piggyback on surgery, and only certain doctor and do it and. I have not heard one person say oh my gosh that's that's totally my bad. I only heard back. So i'm not I have attended the same thing, but it goes on the outside, so all you gotta fight."
304.0,Provider,"yeah yeah and there's just that, like like it not, that you are but yeah and like people don't realize certain psychological pain do."
9386.0,Patient,In then yeah.
