ID,Role,Message
9436.0,Patient,morning. I gave it the two minute to minute Professor leaving.
105.0,Provider,"The. group yesterday I didn't get to hear what was going on it's up to you, if you want to share it but. How you doing."
9436.0,Patient,"I did I don't i'm not doing good really not doing too good. I think above all else is like demoralizing like I was, I was. Immediately afterwards, after the the injections. It was like a tremendous amount of pressure on my back."
105.0,Provider,"Oh, my gosh."
9436.0,Patient,"Like like it felt like my my thighs are going to explode. And then the back, was just an extreme amount of pressure and the doctor said because it's the injection the needle gets to the nerve. So it just immediately like felt like it was going to explode. It has been no relief like 00 to. You know, really. It was just I kind of look forward forward to it for so long and."
105.0,Provider,yeah the connections not not awesome.
9436.0,Patient,"Okay, this should be better. So I was doing I was getting really bad last week, I think it was like. mentally I was doing really bad last week, this week, I have a. I meet with the Court assigned psychologists today. It for like a it's almost like a deposition. that's how my lawyer explained it just like. I told her i'd already been maybe meeting with the clinician and she said no, this is assigned by the Court that way they could just get a sense of where you are mentally and. And just be honest with them. The deposition of a doctor takes place. Next week. So i'm just. i'm just fed up with it all."
105.0,Provider,You had an expectation you kind of had some hope that this would have brought relief you. You really.
9436.0,Patient,Are my hope and felt like it was super high. And it just. there's no when I sleep in my mouth open like if I fall asleep with my mouth open that little dangly ball in the back of my throat like get super big so right now it's like choking me. huh. i'm like i'm like struggling talk right now it's like it's just like enormous right now.
105.0,Provider,i've never heard that.
9436.0,Patient,This has happened to me for my entire life I don't know why. I think it says allergies or it just like. expands. But it was a it's not like. i'm.
105.0,Provider,"When the physician. The injection would bring relief, how was it described what it was supposed to do."
9436.0,Patient,"It was described like almost immediate immediate to. It was like almost immediate relief like I would be walking a walking better I would be able to bend over and do stuff with my kids and just that thought in that expectation or doing that. kind of got me excited. But they also said there, there is a chance, where it doesn't. It doesn't really do much. And then, when I talked to him on Friday. They said, well, I could take a week, up to a week or two to kick in."
105.0,Provider,Oh Shay now that's it.
9436.0,Patient,"You know i'm i'm on. This day seven so today is, they said. Oh, and it's just like it's. it's progressively gotten worse like it's it's just it's it's going back to how I felt. Prior to the injection like I kind of thought the soreness and stiffness was from the injection itself and that really hasn't subsided. So it's just. it's super tender like my back is super super tender and and I just I think that could be from the object injection itself."
105.0,Provider,"So walk me through a typical day over the last seven days, what are your days looking like."
9436.0,Patient,"miserable. Wake up around nine 830 or nine. Go to physical therapy normally. I go three times a week so typically i'm at physical therapy if i'm not. measurable, just like trying to lay down trying to move around. to feel some comfort like I don't. kind of movie yesterday, all I did was wait for the group and. I even asked lovely to pick up my man like I wasn't feeling good enough to leave it normally i'll go pick up my meds to to get around and move and yesterday I just I asked her to pick them up, I went to physical therapy yesterday. i'm not doing much not doing much at all."
105.0,Provider,And what about the the fantasy football what's going on with that you.
9436.0,Patient,don't even have interest like i'm not even.
105.0,Provider,that's not good.
9436.0,Patient,yeah yeah I don't have I don't have no interest. Nothing.
105.0,Provider,Like we're like oh i'll respond.
9436.0,Patient,To Dax like. People text me about it and I just I don't really care.
105.0,Provider,"And it has this been going on for a week or two weeks, this lack of interest."
9436.0,Patient,For about a week okay.
105.0,Provider,And what are you in Leslie talking about.
9436.0,Patient,"we're really not like I, we are talking about normal stuff but. she'll. she'll ask how i'm building i'll just say like grab like that's the extent of it."
105.0,Provider,But it's actually quite a bit.
9436.0,Patient,Well yeah yeah.
105.0,Provider,"So that thing you talked about the loss of interest in previously enjoyed activities is a significant change that's significant. yeah and we need to be. very aware of that watch that closely, we need that to come back, we need you to still. In life when your mind wanders to to negative thinking, what are you thinking."
9436.0,Patient,"i'm really not like I don't. really think anything and just. A miserable like that's my thought, like, for the most like it's just a miserable thought like. How do I find really like. i'm constantly searching how to find relief in my head like what do I, how do I, how do I lay how do I expand."
105.0,Provider,In those.
9436.0,Patient,"unfairness, you know what i've been. Like i'm a crybaby i'll cry normally but i've been like just out of nowhere just. Like breakdown."
105.0,Provider,And what's what's the belief that goes with it.
9436.0,Patient,"I think you were about like just hopeless like a hopeless and it's. What was it, I never cry a physical therapy and. I was, I was in the water and. It just got super tough and I just. I guess I kind of just stopped."
105.0,Provider,"Someone help you in that moment, was anyone there to kind of hold space for you during that."
9436.0,Patient,Oh yeah yeah.
105.0,Provider,Do you see the connection that you had had a lot of hope.
9436.0,Patient,Oh yeah.
105.0,Provider,"waiting a long time, so it could add to this. Just the compassion, the loving kindness compassion that you had hoped and you're dealing with a pretty big letdown and you might be generalizing it into other parts of your life. And I just want to check in a little bit into that hopelessness. Or is it getting to the point that you don't want to feel alive. No okay. No so you're saying no you. Are not having suicidal ideations."
9436.0,Patient,yeah no it's not getting to that point. Like i'm 100% miserable but. Like I got I got my babies like I got there is there joy in their faces so.
105.0,Provider,So what position sit late extend what is. Sitting sitting. yeah okay.
9436.0,Patient,Almost sitting to where i'm like. I was like a 90 degree angle like where i'm like.
105.0,Provider,Really supported. yeah so that chair the debt can can work.
9436.0,Patient,yeah oh yeah.
105.0,Provider,Is there some fun stuff that you can get the kids in the car.
9436.0,Patient,we're doing. yeah we could we could like we can go in. There active.
105.0,Provider,"With this right you don't know so what it's doing is of trying to say let's do what works for you, what is it in in that living room in that kitchen that needs to be a second hand chair, something that brings some relief, you need to meet this demand this you have. In this feels good in the car need to have that spot in the kitchen and in the living room and in the bedroom and do you. And how can you get that stuff."
9436.0,Patient,"Right, no. I do like. I don't know."
105.0,Provider,tell me what you mean.
9436.0,Patient,"Like I I will sit around in the House, but it's not. it's like super out there, like to the kids like. They don't even want me to send like. they're so active like I can just sit around."
105.0,Provider,"You might. Yes, he so so The irony is there's a belief that you should not got an idea about what a dad supposed to do a good dad, but the problem is, you may get to the point that you don't want to get out of bed at all. Right so. somewhere in the middle. This is a. Temporary thing. Your children will remember how they felt around you. that's the key. that's the key how they feel around you and you can be a loving fun generous helpful dad in a chair wheeling around. and include them in it, you know when the timer goes off make dad sit down, so I can last longer include them in it. So that it's a fun game, and when you are in the chair something fun happens, we get to race we get to I don't know what you know we ride a counter, and that means we get to do this thing get rid of this negative opinion about yourself. Right right because I want you, and I wonder if. What happens, has to do with your own. Childhood like I don't want my children to feel like how I felt when I was young and get the data but you're not your dad right."
9436.0,Patient,"yeah no. I mean what it was when I get lost in the. I need to do all that I really do, but I get lost in the. Like I can be having a really good time with the kids with Leslie and then. It is a hopeless feeling like. Things have progressively gotten worse through. And it will get better but. from getting injured backfilling worse than losing my job. injections not working to like it's just sometimes i'll get stuck in that in the. i'll get stuck in the crap and. And I need to to remember not to stay there. Because I will I will incorporate all that, like, I will. Try to. there's some I try. I try to fake it I try to fake it to where I am. Having German there's no like it's. Not."
105.0,Provider,"I know well, I know there's no fun because fantasy football isn't fun. You don't have to the pharmacy to even get a little movement, so this is a, this is a very distinct sign of depressive episodes so you got hit pretty hard with it okay. really hard and we've got this feature of some hopelessness. But on top of that what you have is. it's going to stay like this that's that feature of the hopeless it's not you were able to say it will get better. Now you thinking it's going to be this windfall of perfect healing might not be the way to go, you know. it's gonna be it's gonna be incrementally better. But maybe not setting yourself up quite the what may have happened with the injection that may have been a bit of a setup."
9436.0,Patient,Right.
105.0,Provider,"So it's okay so so the differences, this might be a good time to think of the parts work for just a moment and to the degree that you you're familiar with it, we can do a little bit this morning is depression, and this is how this model of therapy is so different is a part it's not you. The depression is showing up for a reason. Okay, and I think this morning i'm going to lower my desk I need to sit down. let's do a little bit of work without okay let's let's change this relationship so that it's not it's not owning you and wiping okay. Just to review just basics on this is that any part that is not confident curious compassionate clear. Is the part I noticed Russian that's usually what's really different about this because usually. All depressions bad bad bad well. You know we're gonna we're going to look at it a little differently today Okay, so I want you to use your right brain that imagination if you're comfortable enough close your eyes my eyes are mostly going to be down, as I take notes okay."
9436.0,Patient,All right.
105.0,Provider,"i'd like you to picture if you can. Depression. But it looks like the shape the color the size. And really allow the imagination to to take over around that what do you, what do you feel might find it in the body might have a weight to it a vibration color sighs, what do you see."
9436.0,Patient,dark.
105.0,Provider,"So testing out to see if this is a protective part. Just ask it to step back, so that you can get to know it a little bit better we're not going to abandon it we're going to actually learn what it has to offer this system and see if it's willing to kind of move out of you and away for a little bit. Are you willing to let me get to know you better. um it does help to say it out loud, then we see this distinction of the part."
9436.0,Patient,Where you need to step back.
105.0,Provider,And it's so that I get to know you.
9436.0,Patient,get to know you. yeah I get to know you.
105.0,Provider,And what do you observe happening.
9436.0,Patient,Nothing nothing.
105.0,Provider,"Nothing so, is it possible it's still blended with you. I didn't notice your style and i'm glad you said it out loud your style was you made a demand. And instead. I would like you to ask question we've got to get consent and permission, are you willing to let me get to know you better."
9436.0,Patient,"Or you can you step back, so I can get to know you better."
105.0,Provider,"Just notice, even the subtlest of difference between that reaction from the other style of demand. It doesn't blend maybe you could ask out loud what are you concerned will happen if you step back to announce that one out loud."
9436.0,Patient,What are you concerned.
105.0,Provider,What are you concerned will happen if you step back and.
9436.0,Patient,You can turn what happened if you step back and i'm blood.
105.0,Provider,"and watch that dark depression watch it see what it was kind. Of afraid, will happen to you, it seemed it says back. i'm interested in all of the subtleties that are going on. Even even in quiet or looking away it all matters. Which part is communicating right now, would you say is this, you need go, or is this depression."
9436.0,Patient,I don't even know I I just okay.
105.0,Provider,I can help tell me.
9436.0,Patient,Zero like.
105.0,Provider,"Perfect Okay, then that's where we are we're at zero thought. I want you to notice notice in your body, where I have zero thought where is that."
9436.0,Patient,my head.
105.0,Provider,yeah the hands have been wasn't around a bit huh.
9436.0,Patient,yeah. Okay.
105.0,Provider,"So let's go to those hands, I want you to really notice the the tactile. They felt your face they fill your genes they feel. carsey just really pay attention to them right now. noticing texture temperature. And again, this is where this stuff can seem goofy but just work with me here and i'd like you to turn your attention the same way we did with the other parts we're going to do with the hands. and ask them. ask them permission if it's Okay, if you have a thought."
9436.0,Patient,"Is it Okay, that I ever thought."
105.0,Provider,"and watch their reaction really pay attention to the sensation in those hands. Since they're responding back. What they're doing. what's the essence of their their message back to you. Would you say they're saying yes or no to you, do you think that responses."
9436.0,Patient,Nothing.
105.0,Provider,"Just it's just nothing and Miguel, what is it like for you to be around. Nothing. what's the emotion let's see if we can label that."
9436.0,Patient,Regular just.
105.0,Provider,Regular.
9436.0,Patient,Okay.
105.0,Provider,"you're doing just fine there's no way to do this wrong everything that you tell me, is exactly. on time. Okay it's just being able to communicate it. there's no way for you to do this wrong it's just whatever comes up next, I just want to know about it, so I can be helpful. So it's just this sort of nothing. see if you can identify. Nothing how old that is let's go back in time and see if we can find some sort of anchor of an older moment in time, when there was this same there's just nothing zero. Thought. Be careful not to judge it because I still want to know what that first responses when you're kind of tracking back to see how old that experience of nothing and zero thought. The be mindful that there might be a critic that's judging whether it's okay to say it or not."
9436.0,Patient,Maybe like. Maybe like 15 years ago 10 years 20 years ago.
105.0,Provider,"what was going on, then."
9436.0,Patient,I was up. I was in heavy use like heavy good.
105.0,Provider,"Yes, okay all right yep. Okay, and that is a desperate last ditch effort. Okay, so. That was there to try to protect you. From what. was so bad that it thought there's no other option but he escaped and numbing. This this other thing it was protecting you from feeling."
9436.0,Patient,Everything.
105.0,Provider,"Well, literally."
9436.0,Patient,yeah.
105.0,Provider,"let's go directly to it, so that let's actually go to that drug use that's the protective part and ask it what would have happened to me know if you didn't take over just ask that out loud and then wait for the response."
9436.0,Patient,"Oh, what happened to be 15 years ago you didn't take over."
105.0,Provider,Now watch closely and listen. What is it saying back or communicating. You don't have to know why the response is what it is. Because i'm here i'm here to guide. Just pay attention to what it's respond sometimes it's a it's the absence of something so just let me know what what you experience with this.
9436.0,Patient,The only thing that changes like more darkness they got darker the dip. whoo okay.
105.0,Provider,"This is a complicated question and I can repeat it i'd like you to turn to darkness these drugs. and ask it. Would it like. To not work. If we could heal. What when it's trying to solve but it's like a break. If you and I healed. A problem. Really you're asking what it like a break really whether it's Okay, you and I go about healing."
9436.0,Patient,Would you like a break.
105.0,Provider,"Now, in the shaking of the head a little now."
9436.0,Patient,there's more just like a blow to my face is like a.
105.0,Provider,lawyer.
9436.0,Patient,"Price like I said, like a shock like. The only change that."
105.0,Provider,"yeah a little bit of a blur and surprise and shock, on the face. Now you make out. At all interested in curious about what needs healing."
9436.0,Patient,My. yeah.
105.0,Provider,"What you asked that black drug. protective part that one from 15 years ago. Ask it, what is it about me you don't trust about being able to maybe handle. problem. You said about me you don't trust and just ask that."
9436.0,Patient,What is it about me you don't trust.
105.0,Provider,Let me get on what is responding with wondering if you're editing.
9436.0,Patient,me.
105.0,Provider,"Okay, so Miguel, do you know what that is. So ask it, what is it about."
9436.0,Patient,What is it about me.
105.0,Provider,"could be subtle Mike is something you see it my message you in the body there's still a message coming your way what's happening. Who knows what the problems for 15 years ago what partners with the real problems. No. No one knows. not allowed to talk about it they've been. i'd like to know who, that is. What does he have to say what's the problem. me check in what's the emotion yeah what's the emotion you're having right now."
9436.0,Patient,I guess just frustration.
105.0,Provider,just go with that was there also a frustration like 15 years ago also.
9436.0,Patient,Oh. I just didn't care.
105.0,Provider,"I didn't care. What does the item care part have to teach us today. So here's My suspicion. Until i'm wrong, and I could be i'd like you to maybe see that possibly what drugs did was make you not care they don't care, so I want you to go to any years ago if you were busy caring. What would have happened. Were things to care about back then. jugs made sure you didn't. What were they. What were the things that was scary too hard too much to care."
9436.0,Patient,people thought like a dating. anyway.
105.0,Provider,Was there a time when you. were concerned about what people thought.
9436.0,Patient,A little bit.
105.0,Provider,"Okay, so go back to we're going to kind of toggle back and forth the drugs made sure you didn't care about who or what. Try to catch the first response because i'm not sure whether there's been a lot of analysis going on, back in there. Make sure you didn't care about what."
9436.0,Patient,Real me.
105.0,Provider,"yeah what would happen if there was more time and energy spent. caring about you. What happened what is drugs so worried what happened it's gotta jump in there, what might happen first response. How does depression. and drug use. Try to keep you. From caring about yourself. How to both of those parts tempt. To try to make sure you don't. care about you. piece that I don't understand that I haven't quite heard yet is what would happen if you did. Because they're showing up for a reason. Depression keeps you from caring. about you, maybe. Maybe turn towards it now and save woody, what do you concern will happen if I start caring about myself. might be in your analytical part trying to figure out the answer before the dialogue happens see if you can ask the analysts to step back, so that I can be present and do all that heavy lifting of analysis and interpretation and guiding. And just ask out loud hey depression. What would happen if I cared about myself."
9436.0,Patient,I hated the pressure would happen if I cared about myself.
105.0,Provider,"watch that. there's darkness or. Maybe some other shape, or what is it respond with."
9436.0,Patient,Like a release.
105.0,Provider,"And what bad things might happen if there's a release. release is typically a good thing. You were released. cared for yourself, you feel release. Then, what would happen. So I would like to talk directly to depression. So you kind of be in touch with that part in yourself. We go. Because I don't i'm not hearing a lot of conversation going on, so i'm going to see how it goes I talk directly to it, so I might say hey depression. I know you're showing up to try and take care of Miguel you love him, and you have his best interest in mind and you think, for some reason that bringing his energy low and his interest in things down. is helping him and I appreciate your help. What are you afraid, will happen if you let him take care of himself, I mean, is it that you don't think he knows how to do it. Tell me what's happening can be ever so subtle."
9436.0,Patient,is drawing.
105.0,Provider,"blanks. So depression, I wonder if it's you keep him dulled to enjoyment does that protect them from disappointment. doesn't have to get as helps up is that what you're protecting them from. I don't mind being wrong. What do you do for Miguel that. getting out of bed and try new things. getting excited can't do you do for him. This is there a part that wants. To get interested and excited. aren't that far away. Depression is there. Any faith. In any part. That. can make this system better. Never witnessed anything else work. About as well. As depressing the system. Okay. And you separating again for this last piece. Do you see it that it wants you to not. What I want you to feel. right and it was a job drugs were able to do that too, and when this depression, no longer works drugs may be there as a last ditch effort and that might be scary. So I think we need to listen to what depression is trying to solve when you start to think. something happens and depression is concerned, if you start thinking. What might happen. The body almost like don't want to don't want to say it to wanna."
9436.0,Patient,I guess there's more pain.
105.0,Provider,"yeah well then, it means. That these parts, if you would be trying to protect you from more pain doesn't it make sense. Okay. All that may be happening is that there's some very old exile piece of you that's getting triggered by this massive event that's happening in your life. sense of maybe helpless and hopeless in there. might actually be quite a bit older. That we haven't been able to sort of air out not at least today. And going blank. Is depressions effort to try and keep you from thinking. Because soon follows pain. doesn't want you to feel. That you're missing out on your life that way, all the creativity and all the spontaneity and helpfulness that's attached to these parts that are getting sent away and exiled away. Not part of this this puzzle anymore. Can you think of one thing to say. To depression argue back that you can handle the thinking pain. Think about times when you have how hard you have prevailed have been difficult things. Can you find at least one piece of evidence that you can be with thinking pain."
9436.0,Patient,"Really, a lot."
105.0,Provider,"It might be useful to really have that kind of inner dialogue. Between confidence that you just experienced i've done this, a lot. and saying that back to depression sort of saying. I can, I can be with it, I can think. I can do it. Could you share out loud, one thing that you could say to depression. To push it back just a bit to reassure it it's okay I got this we can we can we can think. hard time to go. aren't you. So a role model. That one version. It might be something like thank you depression. you're trying to spare me more disappointment of getting my hopes up. I appreciate it. But i'm missing out on my liveliness on my vitality and my spirit. I can do this i've done hard things before I will gather information. I will ask more questions I will ask for more help I will rest more I will eat differently, I will continue to problem solve and stay in. My life. Thank you for trying to spare me more pain. what's that like to hear me kind of speak up for that. That self that core self."
9436.0,Patient,Little reassuring.
105.0,Provider,Do you have that part inside you that could do that.
9436.0,Patient,yeah.
105.0,Provider,"A little bit more today, maybe a little more than yesterday and maybe it might include. The chasm which means there's this space between a thing, and a thing and then that's fine. It might be time to turn to faith and they might be in quite opposition to depression, certainly in opposition to drugs but faith does is it doesn't have to know it does the next loving thing anyway. Maybe today. might include that part in the conversation of what to do, how to move how to rest where to rest how to play what to eat what to say who to ask for help. Maybe crying with someone surrendering to the fact that this right now has some physical. pain to it, but the suffering. Is option. Miguel have something tangible an actual thing that you need to be saying in your mind, do you know what you need to be saying in your mind. No don't know. I was talking about faith, what does faith say to depression. What would it be like for you to let faith be in the lead a bit today how am I today be slightly different. Think about it, as you leave the car today. What will be different. That was hard for you to imagine. it's very possible Miguel and we're we're at the top of the hour, so you can start to open your eyes it's very possible that the focus today might needed to have been more on the grief."
9436.0,Patient,Right.
105.0,Provider,Sure possible.
9436.0,Patient,yeah.
105.0,Provider,"there's a very strong looks like just a big disappointment i'm not sure if that's what it is. But it needs attention and if we don't attend to it so i'm looking around at all these other things, but really there might be just this. Still, is trying to say you got to hear me out first. Right nobody's really listened. Have you done some journaling around that I know journaling has been helpful."
9436.0,Patient,"Not this week, I mean."
105.0,Provider,yeah.
9436.0,Patient,Can you ever really done anything.
105.0,Provider,"yeah there's been a big change, so we need to watch this very closely, if because this depression i'm talking about still might be in the lead, saying and I don't know some of the stuff that we were talking about did it resonate with you that really is trying to spare you from. From more okay so. So I know this seems really kooky, but when you actually think of it as a part, as if it's a some personality, you can say to it, thank you. But you might end up like.
