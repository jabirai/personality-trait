16700.0,Patient,"hi Good afternoon, Dr ella good."
300.0,Provider,hi how are you.
16700.0,Patient,I am.
300.0,Provider,I got your messages about.
16700.0,Patient,"The transferring from Thursday to the Wednesday group yeah thank Thank you so much, I think Leslie has confirmed that I should be starting within the Wednesday group on this Wednesday."
300.0,Provider,"yeah check it out um It is at this time, just to give you a heads up of females you got three awesome females so just a heads up I don't."
16700.0,Patient,know.
300.0,Provider,"If that matters or not, but uh."
16700.0,Patient,"yeah I remember you mentioning it last time. Okay, no worries yeah I think we should be okay."
300.0,Provider,"yay all genders are cool. cuz I haven't the other group there's actually one one male and I guess, he told the therapists he's working with that. You know, he feels a little odd because, like at this point he's definitely out no it's him and then now there's I think there were four females, I see, so I don't know hopefully it."
16700.0,Patient,No worries I don't think I have any concerns about the ratio.
300.0,Provider,"awesome so so we were talking, we were having a good conversation about kind of like how to help you um you know recover from everything that happened, and when to move forward in an even better way than before and use it as like a time to explore and grow right. So if you do you recall, where we were at when we were talking."
16700.0,Patient,"um I think we were just going over you were just asking me some general questions on my overall history, and I think that's where we had ended up, I was basically explaining how I got into the overall situation. With with my alcohol and weed usage and then I was expressing that last week, I had been stopped being. usage and just trying to get or I wanted to take the extra weeks since we last talked to see how things were going to be going um luckily I haven't relaxed or anything and i've just been kind of. Dealing with some of the withdrawal symptoms. So nothing's too crazy I don't think my mood swings have been drastic, so I think i'm doing okay right right now in terms of the patrols it's just insomnia, is little bad and then a little bit of trouble focusing OK."
300.0,Provider,"OK OK, and then we talked about some medications I think as well, did you get a chance to."
16700.0,Patient,"yeah I think of the three you had recommended the one that looked most enticing was the. restaurant, I believe. But I also didn't want to follow up on that and just to kind of understand if I were to kind of take that what would be the cadences is something where I would. need to since I also saw that it was supposed to be used as a potential antidepressant I don't know if I should be taking it only at nights when i'm feeling like i'm not able to sleep, or is it something you would recommend me kind of taking daily."
300.0,Provider,"that's a really good question so yeah typically when we're talking about antidepressants we use them, we want you to utilize them in a very in a regular fashion. Like every day. yeah same time if you can now. In this particular case, since our main use of this substance of this medication is more acute and it's more for sleep aid, then, then I think that we can get away with not you don't have to do it every day you just do it on nights where you think you're going to need that extra support."
16700.0,Patient,"Okay, and then I just wanted to double check that with the cadence like this, I should be like fine with like the drug isn't something i'll be."
300.0,Provider,"No, no yeah so yeah it and that's exactly why I use it is I use it a lot in addiction medicine, what I do is I don't want to use substances that tend to cause more problems. Right, then you know, so the pros you know I want the pros outweigh the cons and, in this case yeah this one is not a habit forming not like right away habit forming thing I mean sure if you were on it for months, then when you're getting off maybe we can go a little slow but no it's."
16700.0,Patient,"Okay, so Would I be okay, and considering this is just like a sleep aid where you know it feels like i'm waking up at 2am. And I need does it trigger quickly or like."
300.0,Provider,It should be pretty quick reason why.
16700.0,Patient,sounds good.
300.0,Provider,"When you've taken it should help you feel sedated pretty. pretty much right away it's not like it has to. be taken for several days in a row, in order to really usually it works right away."
16700.0,Patient,"Okay sounds good yeah I think the past week, the difficulty is just been I I realize i'm not going to be getting much sleep so i've just been kind of working until about two to 3am. And then, when I do sleep it's just like quick quick winks and I do feel like I may be starting to dream again but i'm the memory isn't coming back so I don't exactly remember what i'm dreaming about it, they don't seem to be positive, though, so so. It might just be kind of a mood yeah so like I feel like it wasn't a good dream, at the same time I don't remember what actually happened so it's just it's a weird feeling, so I do feel like i'm kind of drifting in and out. Okay."
300.0,Provider,"Well, at least you're getting some sort of rest, you know."
16700.0,Patient,"yeah and it has been getting better than the past few days i'm hoping, you know with with the weekend and not working for a few days, hopefully it will be better tonight and tomorrow so fingers crossed there."
300.0,Provider,"Okay, and as you were talking, I was trying to pull up your chart for me and, yes, speaking of work and you had mentioned that you are, you know you're taking you were kind of doing your own thing tell me about those projects what it, what are you doing."
16700.0,Patient,"Oh yeah so I work at a tech company as a product manager, so a lot of. The deliverables are kind of things I need to drive myself so i'm i'm in charge of like some. goals by the end of the year and trying to hit those but unfortunately it's been kind of a rough period, as you can imagine, and i'm not doing so well in terms of performance. So we'll see where that goes I do realize I need to be in a better state of mind, just to kind of focus on things and it's been a little bit difficult to. I guess focus and carve out a huge amount of time without kind of getting distracted and most of my day is still a lot of meetings, and so I you know I always make those meetings but I I always feel like i'm. I don't feel like i'm as impactful in those meetings anymore, it feels like you know, sometimes the information goes in and i'm not able to absorb it completely, and so I do feel a little. anxious about the the work performance, while i'm dealing with you know the overall Joel."
300.0,Provider,Is the kind of reminding you of the Microsoft days or not.
16700.0,Patient,"um oh yeah so um it's it's a little different I think the the internal my Microsoft days I didn't have really good communication with with the manager. And so I wasn't really even sure if I was kind of doing, whether or not, and so this one it's you know the communications is a lot better. And it's just very hinted that they're looking for me to perform just a little bit more um so yeah I do feel, like some of the pressure may be self imposed as well, just like I just feel like i'm not hitting the targets that we had set and I don't want it to be a reoccurring. case."
300.0,Provider,"And and tell me about the the targets for the type of job that you do is it like. When they say you know we're not meeting our target, can you do a little bit more whatever what do they mean is it that you have to be innovative and creative and think of something brand new and like solve."
16700.0,Patient,"A problem or yeah it's mainly Problem Solving so so as an example, I work on an APP so i'm the owner of the Platform side for one of these mobile Apps that the company works on. And one of the things we're looking to improve this this quarter or like yeah this quarter was reducing the number of crashes, so that the overall user experience gets a little bit better and then improving the battery life, and so, because those tweets are just very kind of vague. directions it's on me to really define Okay, what are the actual targets, going to be hitting. To show that we're actually making progress of. Those simple. right for those spaces so it's. I feel like i've been making her i've been setting targets that when I had set them it's just really not clear if we're actually going to be able. To hit them, I know you know teams in general, just say like hey shoot for the stars and you know see see where you land and so it's been a part of the disconnect, but I do feel responsible at the end of the day. Whether or not we the goals, I would be the one that should take the blame or you know I went up for for the rest of the team, even though we are working together as a team."
300.0,Provider,"So okay so maybe i'm setting like you said shoot for the stars kind of philosophy, always a good thing, but maybe it's kind of like. hope for the best prepare for the worst thing where maybe you need to just a suggestion just the thought that pops up like Okay, so you want to increase. You know user satisfaction by decreasing number of crashes, you also want to increase battery life so Those are two separate things right to separate goals they're not necessarily linked. It doesn't."
16700.0,Patient,"crash because there's no battery right yeah they're completely separate things and then they're just these are the. The I guess the numbers, the metrics that our leadership is looking for our team to. improve improve in the quarter."
300.0,Provider,"And so, and it's and you run you're the head of the team, so you. You need to think of okay well, what are the top reasons we have for crashes, you know X, Y Z and then have the team come up with potential solution."
16700.0,Patient,"yeah. yeah that's how we typically work, I tried to set the the what we're going to be looking to do for the quarter and then why exactly what we're looking to do it, and then the engineering team. helps really figure out how they're going to go kind of accomplish it I just feel like the what i'm currently setting that the what's that i've been saying i'm haven't been as impactful once the engineering team, and it goes off to investigate and so."
300.0,Provider,"The message right Okay, except like theories of like okay we're getting crashes, what do I think is going to hell right. From this from this from this and your your thoughts and then you send the engineers and then, when they come back with the data you feel like."
16700.0,Patient,It can't yeah it wasn't enough. wasn't it's like the data that we're getting is not.
300.0,Provider,Isolating.
16700.0,Patient,"Low right exactly there's there's a it's not a I think. At the end of the day, my goal is to create a good story to tell you know leadership and with the data that we're getting the story is just like if you listen to the story yeah you'll be like oh that doesn't really make sense."
300.0,Provider,"yeah like we're we're having an issue and here's why you just want to try to make a more sense okay got it and so that that means to me, that means you need to be able to focus, you need to be clear headed yeah. You need to be able to analyze the data, you did receive so far and kind of see okay well this didn't lead anywhere So what does that you know, like kinda like it's a little bit detective work a little bit like. yeah no deduction of like okay well if this is not at this must be it, you know yeah so."
16700.0,Patient,"And I do feel like i'm having difficulty with with the cost structure portion like it's hard for me to set aside like an hour, just to be able to. kind of dive in I do get distracted from from time to time I don't think it's like ADHD or anything I don't know if i've. i've never been diagnosed with with anything like that in the past, but I do realize that it's been difficult to kind of focus on on the world where I know it's I know it's important, I know I should do it, but it's just. I just feel like partly procrastination partly like if I don't think about it, maybe it'll go away, but it's never really going to go away. My brain still kind of wired. into position where like I had been using to kind of forget right if you've ever watched the movie click I really do feel like oh so it's an Adam sandler movie where he can see magic remote to kind of skip the time. And I felt like when I was kind of. abusing anything. I just felt like I was skipping through moments of time in my life to you know not think about things, but at the end of the day, all of those things that I had skipping still were there, and so. They just piling up right right."
300.0,Provider,And like ostrich with the head in the ground syndrome.
16700.0,Patient,"Yes, yes that'd be a good yeah where you know if I put my head in it just means you know."
300.0,Provider,And then it doesn't go away and then you're like oh no.
16700.0,Patient,"Friday, and now I have to face all the now pull my head out of the. Out of the dirt now."
300.0,Provider,"Okay, I got you so Okay, so you find yourself in that situation i'm. Okay, thank you, thanks for diving into it i'm just trying to understand i'm trying to understand where you're coming from. Do you feel it tell me about work environment, do you feel like your current space to work in your home your phone is good and can do."
16700.0,Patient,yeah yeah i'm the only one to be home during the day bye bye folks still they don't work remote jobs they do need to go in. And so yeah I pretty much have the House to myself and so i'm like there shouldn't be any outside distractions right think it's mainly just me trying to get my stuff to you know focus a little bit you.
300.0,Provider,Would you be better you think if you have you ever tried to going to like a coffee shop or somewhere semi public where you could still have enough privacy to think.
16700.0,Patient,"I i've done that in the past, but I don't think coffee shops work for me, I do prefer to be. Well, I guess, in my own office right yeah so in the past, I think i've worked in open space environments, as well as an environment where I had my own office and I definitely feel like I was performing a lot better when I was actually in my office right."
300.0,Provider,Okay um.
16700.0,Patient,"And most of my days, maybe meetings so I feel like if I went to a coffee shop I just be bothering. Others right right right yeah I need to get like a private room."
300.0,Provider,In a library or something yeah yeah like a now they're coming up with those things I don't know where you're.
16700.0,Patient,"Yes, like those we works those private lounge spaces yeah."
300.0,Provider,"which seems kind of cool like if you're like somebody like you like that's kind of working, but. Working remotely and it's kind of. You kind of go out so like you see people but they're not necessarily in your company, but you. Have lounge space."
16700.0,Patient,But then you can go into your private kind of.
300.0,Provider,"Anyway, yes okay so that's your job stuff. We were talking about looking at my notes depression back in college that you were you had sought treatment at that time. Okay. desire to engage in individual therapy, as well as substance use disorder okay i'm Okay, I think. The rem RON yeah the murtaza pain option to help as needed is something I can go ahead and I could even prescribe it to now, and you can have it, you don't even have to pick it up from the pharmacy unless you really."
16700.0,Patient,feel like I needed her okay. yeah and that would be.
300.0,Provider,"You know just to have it there, ready to go in case you're like you know what I didn't sleep well, maybe i'll just give this a whirl you can pick it up and then. And then, let me know when we meet in our in our."
16700.0,Patient,Meetings yeah sounds good.
300.0,Provider,um so what else so when you're. When you're assigned to a group I think what they try to do is assign you to the same therapist so the therapist that's running the group typically they wanted to kind of be. congruent and like just kind of continuous so they want you to be with the therapist and the and the therapist. Running Valerie is her name one.
16700.0,Patient,"yeah I spoke with Valerie yesterday, actually, so I had my first meeting with Valerie already yeah so if she's the one working with you. We already had a chance to chat."
300.0,Provider,that's cool so did you like her.
16700.0,Patient,"Did that go well yeah I think it went pretty well um. I do feel like it was it was still meeting so i'm looking forward to talking with her more as well, because I don't feel like we went through everything you. can imagine right it's right on."
300.0,Provider,"Time okay good but yeah so I suggest that'll be great, so I think yeah let's try let's go with the this group Wednesday group and then and then. Your one on one meetings with Valerie I think once you see how the group is like what the conversation leads doing stuff it'll kind of trigger your thoughts and. Hopefully you'll have your own like okay well yeah in my one on one with Valerie maybe I can explore this."
16700.0,Patient,A little bit right. yeah that's right.
300.0,Provider,And you know every group is a little different so just to kind of I know you're new to the group concept so you're kind of liking I don't know.
16700.0,Patient,yeah I wasn't sure what to expect.
300.0,Provider,"is so it's like it's what you make of it like anything right, so you can be a very active participants or you could be like the guy that sits in the back of the class and it's like he's present but is he really. You know so it's up to you what you want to make of it and it's totally fine when no one's judging you this is free you're here because of you want to. um but you know I suggest, if you can push yourself, even when you're like I don't really know about this topic, or whatever like just try to try to engage you might surprise yourself because. You might find yourself thinking about things you never really push yourself to think about or you know and that's where growth happens, you know and change in our brains and the way we the thinking patterns. But also. You know, be kind to yourself be easy on yourself it's it's it's supposed to be you time, so you know it's not a we're not no one's giving you a grade or anything like that it's just no pressure just enjoy it hopefully. Valerie i've we've kind of crafted a format, where I am she leads us so far she's been leading us to do, like a meditation or a body scan or something in the beginning to help ground, the whole group, all of us together, and then we we go into whatever topic she brings. Or if somebody has something special to say."
16700.0,Patient,And then these are one when our meetings on Wednesday.
300.0,Provider,"But one hour with the caveat that and maybe Valerie will talk about it at the next meeting, we it's technically 16 minutes, but we kind of are playing with the format, so that we have Valerie and I have a little time at the end carved out so her, and I can have. The discussion question. or something, how did it all today and how, how do you think these people are doing and whatever. So so maybe it'll be more like 45 minutes or 15 minutes we just didn't have the heart to say anything this last time because everybody was so engaged like, and it was like a really good conversation, so we didn't want to like cut it short. But we'll see we'll look at. Approximately an hour. And then any any concerns or anything like that. You wanted to talk about that we didn't get to yet or. Anything any other goals you have."
16700.0,Patient,"um yeah I think one of the overall goals like regardless of once I am hopefully able to deal with the substance abuse portion which i've been pretty happy that you know, luckily so far I haven't done any taxes and we're doing okay. I do think one of the things is or that i've been struggling with is i'm not very sure I haven't really set any goals for myself in the past, you know few years and. It really feels like i'm i've been kind of just wandering around aimlessly and I don't really have any you know good good goals for myself and I know the immediate goals right now it's probably just you know fixed the substance usage, but then, I guess, aside from that. I would like to work on setting myself, so you know personal goals that I would strive for, because it really feels like i've been. Reflecting yeah just been."
300.0,Provider,"So I think that's fantastic kind of and it's interesting because it's kind of parallel to your work life, right now, and like kind of your work. or. What they're requesting of you have like being very a little more specific, with what are you targeting and what are you doing the Info that's coming back, and how are you analyzing and. You know, making a story out of it right so same thing to you in your own way you it's very helpful and that's kind of I will, if you hadn't said it that's what. I would have said would be the next step for you would. Be to take time to reflect on like like basically, I want you to try to your homework, if you will, should. Be to. To do some self reflection. And I find it journaling is a really good way to do that because it's something for you it's private to you, you don't have to share it. it's just there but it's something tangible and it's something you can go back to and look at and be like oh that's interesting like an hour ago I wrote something like this, but like now, I feel. i'm in a different space or whatever it is something there so that later when you meet in a. psycho therapy group or in a in a therapy session, you have it. In your hand to reflect back and be like oh yeah. You know I tend to think. negatively of myself. These are some of the thoughts i've written down on times when. i'm in that mode and that voice is talking to me, this is what I hear for mobile because maybe right now, if I asked you on the spot you'd be like I feel fine i'm cool everything's fine, but when we. Are you with me. Did I lose you."
16700.0,Patient,i'm back sorry just a shoddy Internet here.
300.0,Provider,"weird okay. So what I don't know where I was. I don't remember, do you. I think i'm gonna call. I think what i'm going to do is called you can ask on the phone. So let me do that. Okay, so i'm going to call you. So we're still recording. guys i'm sorry, Sir, some some Internet issues and it didn't seem like it was a hack into improving that's okay totally cool if you're Okay, with the phone right now um. Are you Okay, with the phone Hello yeah. yeah you can keep the video on as well, if you want, but if it freezes we don't have to worry maybe I don't know what, what do you think okay yeah. Okay, so, so I think where did I lose you I lost you where did I lose you the journaling. Then. After that okay so so so your homework should be. Trying to keep it succinct like the the goal to be you know very simple, so the goal, maybe your homework should be by Wednesday by the group's time. use the time between now and then to have reflective time and it doesn't have to be one long hour, if you do it in 10 minute increments that's Okay, too, but you know. carve some time out no stress from the job, no nothing like clear your mind and just say Okay, this is my task right now, my task right now is to just clear my head and just think about. Who I am. Who am I. Who am I to me, you know it's kind of a weird big question but maybe things will pop up like Oh well, I am like, how do you, I want to know how you define yourself, are you defining yourself. Are you attaching yourself to the work that you do, are you attaching yourself to being a beautiful son, are you attaching yourself to whatever what is it that makes you feel like these are things that define me. And then, just like try to write those things down like who are you and then try to see if you can kind of nail it down a little bit Whittle it down what. So, like if you say well i'm a student or i'm a i'm a hard worker or whatever some of those things will ring really true like or like if you said i'm an honest person. versus I am someone who takes pride in my work versus whatever you do different things that you just come up it doesn't have to be. You know perfect you just write things down and then start circling the things that are like wow like this, this is like yeah like I identify with this, I identify with this. And then kind of take the top three of those guys and then we can kind of look at it and be like or you can look at it with Valerie maybe and just kind of be like Okay, so is this. start from there at least it's a map it's the beginning of a map to say Okay, how are you defining yourself, and is there a problem with this is there something not good about that Is there something. I don't know problematic and maybe that's where the root of all this is you're identifying with something that really doesn't make sense or whatever, that we can work on or. or not, maybe, maybe something else will come up maybe it'll come up that you're not living in your value systems there's something you really value, deep down inside. But somehow you're not meeting that because maybe there's something in you that says authenticity is really important to you. But you're feeling like you're gonna you have to swallow some of who you really are in order to meet certain other duties. And so that's being suppressed, and maybe there's a part of you that's like i'm not living. i'm disappointing something inside of me not my family, maybe, but me the remi inside, you know different things so just just kind of jog through see whatever comes up maybe they'll all be kind of jumbled but it's a start yeah actually a very difficult question because I think you mentioned. The first answer that came to mind was like I have no idea. I don't know what I value, so I yeah i'll definitely take some time reflection to them yeah I hope I answer on Wednesday is it just I don't know. yeah well i'll i'll i'll ask it you don't have to answer like tell me your answers, but I will say hey did you work on that did you come up with anything. And then maybe you know, and I may not do it in the group, but maybe i'll write to you in the chat or I will tell Valerie about our plan for you yeah. I do want to kind of re evaluate think about like maybe what I thought to myself when I was younger. You know, face reality, a little bit more yeah because we do we grow up you know the concept, so I want to understand your concept of your world right and it starts with you so let's do that yeah definitely I think that'll be a great public separate oh oh That was good that. sounds good Okay, so I think we'll do that i'll order your rem RON in the meantime. it's usually well tolerated like I said, the only thing we're looking for from it right now is, if you do take it that you take it, maybe 20 minutes 30 minutes before bedtime or or I guess if you wake up in the middle of the night, and you haven't taken it you could try taking it. To give you some sleep that's all. And pharmacy wise did you give the team your pharmacy your preferred pharmacy yeah I told him a walgreens so there's a very close walgreens right right next to me, so I was. Perfect to get in there okay perfect and let me just confirm that it is in here yeah it's on Terra Terra Wall Street yeah I think. 40 excellent a pair of US perfect okay yeah I will so that's a walgreens I will order this there you do not have to pick it up or get it now, or whatever, but if you want to it's there. And that's it so i'll see you Wednesday i'm really excited to remember that the group ID is different than this one okay. You know from you, oh actually I don't have the group ID for the Wednesday same there's it tells me. I should have the right number i'm are we going to be setting up individual folders. yeah yeah we can, I think um I think it's up to you if you're like you know, maybe we should set it up from now we can try to do it today, or we can kind of when we meet on Wednesday. When the group is winding down, you can always stick towards the end I always tell people they can stay towards the end if they want to individually talk and then we can say hey you want to set something up. Or maybe you and Valerie will and then i'll follow up maybe a little later it's up to you. Okay, all right. All right, take care. bye bye bye."
