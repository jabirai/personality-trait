527.0,Provider,yeah.
1693.0,Patient,are dreaming about us being on the cruise.
527.0,Provider,"Sure, well, I you know there's the hard part of all of this to William is that you had a lot of good memories to. Like there was obviously when things lead to divorce, the end the end part of it is not usually not usually very, very good, you know there's a lot of hard feelings and allow you know a lot of emotions with you know that that closure of you know of a relationship, and so you know it's. But there's a lot of good memories in there, and obviously you've got your son from that and so. You know from that marriage. Do you feel like you can't. Be you know can't think about those good memories or keep those memories for yourself, do you feel like you have to get you know just have to not think about them, or have to forget that those good things happened."
1693.0,Patient,"All right, I didn't think about it. Long I don't picture her me. know. But. yeah I did something by myself on a cruise. And I had fun with her on the truth."
527.0,Provider,He.
1693.0,Patient,"yeah so we weren't we weren't fighting or nothing. It was when I came back from the cruise. And about a week later, I wreck your car on pills. That twice yeah miss you learn divorce. And she also told me that if I went to drug rehab that you're thinking about Stan. But I didn't go to rehab fast enough. For me to go from the long distance away we're going to go like right now, today I. don't think it will change anything. I think she had a mindset."
527.0,Provider,"Well that's kind of what i'm wondering to like. If you know it. sounds like she. She put it out there, but then you know there wasn't. You know, not that you didn't do it fast enough like like would there would any would even go into treatment have made a difference or had she already made their mind up you know."
1693.0,Patient,I think she already made her mind good.

527.0,Provider,"yeah that's a long time. yeah it's a long time, and then you know just to let the year ago by me nuts. it's going to just take some time for yourself. And it's a you know I think it's okay to just recognize where you're at to like emotionally. But i'm glad i'm glad to hear that you feel like the medications making a difference, because it seems it seemed to me that it was helping some like you. seem a little more brighter at times you're smiling, you know you're getting out and doing some things and so. I can definitely tell like you're you're doing some things in addition to the medication as well, like we can't just always rely on the medication to. To change things, but I can definitely tell like you're you're working with the medication or the medications helping you work better and get out and do some things for yourself."
