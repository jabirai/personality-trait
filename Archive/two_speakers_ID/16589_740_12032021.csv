But I want to applaud you because you instead of staying home and being the prayer you wish your friend you enjoy their family and you did something for yourself, you bought things for the House, so you didn't stay stuck. yeah and so that's a good thing. Right, so I want to take a moment to I want to take a moment and pause and applaud you for that, I think that that shows great strength and it shows progress."
16589.0,Patient,"yeah I would have normally just said.

No i'm not going to go. Because I knew her mom was going to be there and her mom sometimes you know because I throw my fits around the holidays, where I get one of my moods and i'll just say no i'm going to sit here and when I get there, I just go off and sit by myself and. don't talk to anybody and I made sure I went out of my way and went around to talk to everybody. My Bailey knows that i'm tearing up and he's walking around looking at me going, why are you crying. huh yeah he's he's a really good. knows when I get teary eyed that he always starts pacing.

16589.0,Patient,"Well, I could go out to the cemetery and I actually did that, when I came back to. Norway, I actually went up to the cemetery, which is something I have not done in a long, long time. and I probably could next weekend when caitlin goes to her mom's house, I could probably go back out there yeah that and talk to him, which is something I haven't done in a while other than when I first came back here."

740.0,Provider,"yeah you can you go out there and and the thing about it is it just about. You know, and it was like I told you initially when it comes to grief is not something you get over it just something you learned how to live through. And, in the midst over you you on a memory and and and their legacy and so i've known of people who actually like had tradition doing a holiday when a loved one of my pair. or something like that, and so even will run at the same time putting fresh flowers on the graven sitting there and just thinking about the good old time. You know, on the moments, and to think about a good memory. That you all share together and things like that, so one of the things that I will be with that I will say, and I want to, I want to. They have my dear friend gratitude exercises and it actually helped 50 during this time. Things you can. Different way that you can basically. Show gratitude, or to express gratitude and to me will help. You will help with the depressed come with a depression so. I love a little bit, this is just an idea. talks about it says that. gratitude means appreciating the diff things in life, no matter how big or small. Making. The practice of gratitude a regular part of your day can be a happiness Jeff was saying, and provide other healthy. So one of the he says, having a gratitude journal. Is every evening spending a few minutes writing down some good things about your day. This isn't limited to major venture might be grateful for simple things that's a good meal, a positive frame overcoming an obstacle. Another option again giving thanks keep your eyes open throughout the day for reasons to say thank you make a conscious effort to notice when people do good things, whether for you or for other the other person you recognize a good deed and give us a sincere thank you. They have mindfulness walk go for a walk and make a special effort to appreciate your surroundings, you can do this. By focusing on each of your senses one, at a time in a mini does listening and million, looking around it just around it and so on, shadow knows the size, the found this man sensation you will use me as a cool breeze and you've seen or the clouds and. Now this is my here is what. Maybe this is something that you can do and when you go to see your parents, you can leave this on the grave site and it's a gratitude letter. And thinking about someone who you appreciate. This could be a person who has had a major impact on your life or someone who you would like to thank. write a letter that describes why you appreciate them, including specific examples and details is up to you if you'd like to share the letter on that. And then they have grateful contemplation where it says remove yourself from distraction so just follow the TV. and avoid file and in Spain fat or thin minute meeting to review and the good thing today. The keys is a signal if consistency, think of it like brushing your teeth or it's just that it should be a normal part of your day basis here. you're thinking we can do practice as part of a prayer meditation or on its own, and this is another thing, the last thing, so the gratitude conversation with another person. You can take time lifting groupings you're grateful for throughout the day so in a moment, discussing contemplated each point rather than hiring into the list make this part of your routine by practicing before a meal or foot before bed or add an s another regular time.

Right yeah i'm just saying Remo was on point, and so I had one grandmother, but I wanted to know most. And I always thought about it in regards to I was, I was shooting my bad luck i'm like wait what that mean because. You know, does that mean she could have been living, you know if she would have never met me and i'll kind of start, I mean you can go on and on and on, but the thing about it is, is that I take joy in the fact that, at least for a moment, you know i'm saying. She was."
16589.0,Patient,me she had.
740.0,Provider,"She had a she had the joy of meeting a grandchild. and see the thing about it is that you have to keep their famous athletes to say that it doesn't matter how many times, your mama bumpy roads and all that kind of stuff regardless of the sex she had the joy of the fact that she had Susan."
16589.0,Patient,yeah.

And she knew that you love her and vice versa. yeah it gave her like a joy to be your mom.

With a blessed one was there was able to know when low feels like to receive a look back on your childhood and not have to remember trauma and all that kind of stuff.
