Okay, I was seeing Ashley. and she's she's great she's a great counselor I have a four year old daughter and. The last year was probably just a little. tricky I guess with her. i'm still hoping this window below before this light in here. yeah I just I asked braveheart and actually if I could talk to somebody that is maybe a little older that has a little more life experience."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so so you're feeling that maybe that it wasn't the right fit maybe."
13184.0,Patient,"It wasn't like I said I think she's great she really gave me some good advice, but um. I just think it's hard if you've only gone to school and you haven't really. You know lived it, I guess, like I think there's only so much you can learn in a classroom in a textbook. So um."
760.0,Provider,"yeah there, there can be experienced sometimes people can live a very short period of time and have a whole lot of experience. And then, sometimes people can live a long time, and maybe have a you know less stress less than average it can it can be different, but, but sometimes also there's like. Maybe personalities that maybe don't go together, I don't know I don't know what the situation."
13184.0,Patient,With Ashley see.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, but a very."
13184.0,Patient,yeah wasn't like we rub each other the wrong way or anything like that. You know I got with her she's she's a great counselor. I mainly I was trying to I was asked for someone that is apparent.
760.0,Provider,Okay. Somebody with that kind of life.
13184.0,Patient,Experience yeah it was. like that.
760.0,Provider,All right. yeah.
13184.0,Patient,"Do you do, you have children."
760.0,Provider,I have a about to be 21 year old.
13184.0,Patient,"Okay, so yeah that's what I just figured like it would be a little more like. Cancer to understand I guess."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so just so that we can kind of get to know each other, a little bit I see you're taking up an orphan, can I ask you how that's going."
13184.0,Patient,yeah suboxone that's going good. I like i've been taking that for 10 years now.
760.0,Provider,I never okay.
13184.0,Patient,"i've already talked to Dr sets about this, the one who who prescribes it i'm like I was just taking back in and like you know I come from, like my parents are still together. um I DAS dad is you know. they're just like. They they saw me taking biking in or they could tell something was that and my dad was like whoa look at this isn't you know you don't have to go through withdrawals, I was taking him back in in probably for like two years."
760.0,Provider,mm hmm well you getting it legally initially or did you take. Somebody description or How did this come about.
13184.0,Patient,"fender bender so like I got rear ended. And a doctor is prescribing it to me. yeah it like I told Dr says it's probably. it's a lot easier, I think, to just taper off of I get in and it is suboxone or. w text is. yeah to box on is like I think it's a lot more addictive than of like it is, I mean I think suboxone supertax has its place for somebody that's taken that know or like. oxy cotton even heroin um but for somebody that's just taken like five Viking ins a day I think like just have them taper off of those because. you're you're switching you know, like just switching a Viking in for like stepping that's a lot more addictive set than that, like covers the receptors a lot more MC. affects your mood a lot more than I can and will it's like um yeah I think you're replacing one with setting that's a lot stronger and a lot more addictive than this so. Like."
760.0,Provider,"Do you so do you have a goal to continue. yeah do you have a goal to eventually maybe not now, but maybe long term. know either way where's your head with that."
13184.0,Patient,"yeah trying to taper off right now so. yeah i'm like I tried to cut off a little bit of this strip The thing is, I was taking the two milligrams 70 tax. it's not the film The suboxone is the film. And those like they're two milligrams and you try to break one of those in half, like you could break it in half, but the sides are going to crumble and it just it's kind of hard to to like cut a to middle ground like sublingual into like force."
760.0,Provider,mm hmm.
13184.0,Patient,"Though because I was getting like I was going to a doctor forum and. You know I I had like every like I would get I think like 56 a month and I would just like I started taking only like you said, taking four milligrams a day I would take three and a half milligrams a day you know."
760.0,Provider,"And I did, that is, that something that you were doing with a doctor. yeah OK so."
13184.0,Patient,"The doctor so. You know, he would keep lowering me down and. yeah and then the pandemic kit and I was like you know what like i'm just going to stop taking them I had like I don't know like a little bit set to the side. And I was just like you know i'd already talked to my doctor, he said, go ahead, just you know, if you will, because I had had a little accident. Where I broke a bone in my wrist and. He didn't know if I have surgery or not and he's prescribed me. Like the big eight eight milligrams of them like like 10 of them, or something. So I had those and you know I figured yeah i'll just you know taper off, and you know I got down to about a milligram and. It was just like trying to break those little tools into one and then trying to break a little like it was just crumble so yeah if I would have had the films, I want to be taking them right now. Like."
760.0,Provider,It was just a.
13184.0,Patient,"matter of. You know yeah I mean I did notice like I don't know how many people, you know that's taking those but like going from four milligrams to isn't a big deal. And to the one is like yeah. But going down like trying to get off that last milligram is a pain like your appetite how you feel your mood like for me anyways and I read other people, and I say the same."
760.0,Provider,"yeah because you're you're you're basically like going so far down. yeah it kind of makes sense because there's going to be some point there's going to be a jump jumping off point where you're going to go down to zero and. that's probably going to be, you know something that you'll have to ride through now withdrawal is something that you know it has an endpoint that you have to decide what you know how how quickly or how slowly, who would want to take her with that so."
13184.0,Patient,Have you know a good amount of people that tapered off suboxone.
760.0,Provider,"I have not, I actually have quite unique experience with suboxone because when I first started working with buprenorphine it was during the research when it wasn't even approved yet. This was way back in the 90s, so I was part of a research project in the ECHO Park area of Los Angeles, where we were studying the effectiveness of it. So i'm just now getting back into this side of medication assisted treatment, but I do I do, I do have like over 10 years experience working over there with that particular clinic before the approval, with the FDA so. So, but you know, this is something that you're going to work on with your doctor it's not something you're going to work on with me my my whole point is just to be. That, I want to kind of find out from you is how good, are you at communicating with your doctor and letting them know how the medication is affecting you and what your experiences are and I, you know."
13184.0,Patient,i'm pretty sure that yeah.
760.0,Provider,You pretty good.
13184.0,Patient,i'm pretty good at land well we're.
760.0,Provider,"Good at it okay so just advocating for yourself and and. letting them know because it's not going to be a perfect process Nick. You know you're going to have your good days it's going to be easier at this time and it's going to get more difficult, and this just kind of goes back and forth and that's just part of it so that's what I would encourage you to kind of consider. As far as missing your appointments, can you tell me so now, you know I know you're just not getting to know me. But what's what are some of the things that you think you need to work on the that maybe you didn't feel you were working as well before and. issues with parenting or."
13184.0,Patient,What yeah.
760.0,Provider,The status.
13184.0,Patient,"Some stuff that went on, with my daughter some inappropriate behavior at her mother's House I have 50 split split legal custody. And time split is pretty much 5050. So yeah just some stuff that. Some inappropriate behavior moms and also you know just being a single dad is kind of like. It could be like I say mundane but. You know it's just it has up and downs."
760.0,Provider,"Well, just so I can get a little bit of background, you have one child."
13184.0,Patient,"Yes, one child she's three will be for in February."
760.0,Provider,"So that's that's okay so she's small, so it takes a lot of your time and energy and she's with you, you kind of have to be on top, or you got to make sure she saved. And not getting into something that's going to hurt her and those kinds of things so, can you talk to me about you said 5050 split. What is the inappropriate behavior inappropriate behavior with her mother or maybe somebody else in a household or what are you referring to exactly."
13184.0,Patient,"So yeah my daughter, and I were very close, like, for the first up until December 2020 so last December, I had her probably like 75% of the time i'd have her you know five out of seven days six out of seven days her mother and I lived together for the first two years of her life. I was lucky enough to work from home, so I would have her you know, during the week and you know she went to daycare sometimes. was real little, but sometimes I was just most of the time I was keeper. You know, and when she was younger that was kind of easy the older she get in that's kind of like. The whole, but we are like extremely close and. yeah it's you know I could tell something was up with her just how she was acting. Last probably like. December 2020 probably even I would say November, just acting a little. is just like doing things that she didn't normally do kind of acting out so you know mom was dating somebody. Who she had told me some things about like she told me that he does mdma like it's illegal street drug. I was already kind of worried about that you know."
760.0,Provider,And who was the one that told you that your your ex your. Mother your daughter told you that.
13184.0,Patient,yeah she told me that she.
760.0,Provider,was very upfront with you about that then.
13184.0,Patient,"We were friends like we stayed friends broke up like we stayed we continue to hang out and kind of talk. You know, it was the beginning of the pandemic. Like March. me, and you know we were we stopped living together December 2019 so at the beginning 20 so we stayed friends for a few months, and so. He would come over and she was moving stuff out as well, but we would talk, maybe like. You know, watch a show watch a TV show together or something like that, and you know she would say yeah i'm dating this person, what do you think about this, so you know that's how that came about. As like now she wanted."
760.0,Provider,To tell you that kind of thing now.
13184.0,Patient,"be seen as someone else now. And she like I don't know um it's different our relationship, you know it's it can be tricky it has its nuances co parenting. So um yeah with my daughter, I noticed something was up, and you know I said something to mom and she's like you're you know you don't know what you're talking about so um you know."
760.0,Provider,"What what kinds of behavior did she exhibit that that made you worry or wonder, can you."
13184.0,Patient,"um you know just like yelling and she kept on wanting to like change her underwear. Just like kind of odd behavior. You know, and then like just to stop right here, real quick I didn't really get into detail with the last person Ashley. About older like I was going to core and some other stuff happen because it's like a really long story when I tell her like i'm going I have trial on the night, so if i'm going to tell you all this, like, I want to feel comfortable with you."
760.0,Provider,"I know you know okay. All right, you you, you can tell me as much or as little as you feel comfortable, because I know we've known each other all of about maybe 10. Yes, so you you don't feel pressured. So it's Okay, and you know that i'm a mandated reporter that's The other thing i'm sure you're already aware, but I want to remind you at this point."
13184.0,Patient,Exactly I mean CPS has already been alerted.
760.0,Provider,are already involved okay.
13184.0,Patient,"involved the judge already you know the judge in this case it's ridiculous it's kind of gross. You know, when I first brought it up, she told me why would you talk to your doctor about that you know it was about mom's boyfriend touching her my daughter, and the judges it's like you just she's she's too little to talk about that. So yeah I see you're like yeah you probably can't believe it but yeah it's just. kind of gross the. Recording."
760.0,Provider,"So you're what i'm hearing from you, Nick is that you're you're feeling, really, really worried about your daughter. Well, so maybe you want to kind of process what you're feeling."
13184.0,Patient,"Well um you know yeah like some inappropriate behavior and you know I did call ups, I told them and. You know I didn't sit my daughter down and say look, you need to tell them, I mean I did like sit her down and say hey look you're going to have to tell them tell them what you told me. they're on their way right now but I didn't like I didn't hammer it into her like hey look Penelope you're going to have to. you're going to have to tell them like what you told, but like really get it let it sink in and she's so sweet and luckily for being three years old, she very articulate. she's been able to talk really clear since she was about to. And she's very intuitive so she could like see census stuff."
760.0,Provider,A lot of good still.
13184.0,Patient,"yeah she's just um it's kind of uncanny with her though her aunt is. She has a master's in like child development and it's something like another one and a master's in like psychology. And she you know she just blown away by Penelope by how like and I know all parents think their kids like the smartest to ever um but. yeah so she you know, I was felt very lucky that she was able to convey to me as such a you know barely turning three what was going on and. You know I kind of like playing myself a little bit because I didn't really sit her down that I mean I did, but I didn't really like hammered into her, I felt like. You know she felt comfortable telling me then she could tell and the police, and I call the police and they I asked them if they could send a female officer and they sent to Mel COPs to talk like to question a little three year old girl but it's all."
760.0,Provider,"Right, what do you live in."
13184.0,Patient,"sacramento California it's like a good neighborhood in sacramento and minutes from SAC state it's like a blue collar little league. You know, like, I think the medium home values like 404 50."
760.0,Provider,And you didn't feel you didn't feel like you should call protect child protective services.
13184.0,Patient,I did a call.
760.0,Provider,yeah you did.
13184.0,Patient,"Okay yeah so. And I told her doctor. Okay, so, and this was February 2021. The cost came and they you know she they came in, to talk to her and. You know they asked her what's your name, she said Penelope it and they said, you know who Victor is and she just clammed up and she can't talk anymore, and so I call CPS the next day, and I said yeah the COPs came out here my doctor told me or my daughter told me this happens and. The ups guy said well look like if she didn't talk to the COPs then they don't have a statement there's not much, we could do that they can't do. play into it we're not going to look into it and. So. yeah. It was kind of messed up situation so finally i'm. Her doctor alerted CPS because I, you know I told the doctor. Well Okay, I tried to take her to the doctor in February 2020 and her doctor was that she's been to go into her whole life was like look. she's not on. On our assurance you can't take her is sutter so they're like you can't take your here, you have to take her somewhere else. And so I was like geez that's like I told him, can I just pay you guys with like, can I just pay with a debit card and they they weren't like I don't know it was like I was getting red lights everywhere, just like I couldn't help, and this was February 2020."
760.0,Provider,or 29 and all you wanted them to do was just kind of examine her to look for some kind of insight or evidence.
13184.0,Patient,"I mean examine, but I mean I give her a bath you know when I give her a bath I tell look only mommy and Daddy sees you. You know, without your clothes on only mommy Daddy touch with you down there to clean you. So she had. That so no I wanted her to tell the cost, where she told me I wanted her to tell us what she told me I wanted her to tell the doctors watch on me. So that's what I wanted um yeah so um you know that didn't happen, and finally, I got her to her regular doctor in August and her regular doctor was like okay yeah this happened, let me get over to will tell CPS unfortunately when you Paul on it doesn't really. it's not the same as when we do so um so yeah they they reached out to him and I had a CPS lady come to my house in August, and this is like you know, six months after she had told me and that guy had been. I think like he had stopped seeing my daughter's mom around December so he he wasn't even there when she called me, you know um so. yeah it's just it was kind of and so too, because, like you said hey look i'm i'm going to look into it, but I see that you call this in February, we did you a huge disservice not coming out i'm sorry."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so you've been carrying this heavy weight and this heavy worry for. me, I suppose. yeah Does that mean that all this time, when you're trying to do. You did the right thing from the minute you were concerned about it correct you've made the calls like immediately as soon as you knew and and then. You kept hitting these walls, so does that mean you kept sending your daughter to go see her mother during this time, you had to or how did that so."
13184.0,Patient,"have to identify an ex parte um it's like an emergency, because I had a court date in April, so I filed the fl 300 which is just like. Ordinary form saying, I would like to have full custody. there's you know she's telling me this happened to her, you know. And, or it was like no, you have an appointment in April, you could bring it up, then. Basically, so you're finding out later, you know hindsight is 2020. you're supposed to file an ex parte. I mean i'm not sure I did read that online though back in February. But the judge in January is just like telling me. You know you're 38 with no college education. I don't know what mom hopes to get from you like she's just like. You know, just like i've never i've never had anyone talk to me like that. i've never heard of a judge like she said some other things too, and then her rulings so. um you know it's just been an uphill battle, because the police and CPS has told me the judge has the most power in this situation. And like I told you when I ended up to this judge in April she's like what are you doing talking to your doctor about that, why is it three year old saying stuff like that to you. And just for a little context, like you know i'm white obviously the judges black and white ours mom's Mexican. So um I think that comes into play a little. To an extent so. yeah i'm you know i've already talked about this with my parents with my friends. Really, what I wanted to kind of get through or talk to you today about is just like kind of having how to like deal with trauma and how to deal with. Like past trauma and like repetitive thoughts out of like stop having repetitive thoughts, excuse me hurt the little so you know. So."
760.0,Provider,The trauma you referring to your friend to your daughter's tama to your trauma over worry or both or. Tell me about that.
13184.0,Patient,"Dealing with that is like. That it was like traumatic for her and traumatic for me i'm. Like trying to get through to all these people and. Like just hitting walls and the is yeah it was like even right now, like i'm like traumatize site I can't believe. You know, like, I told Ashley the last appointment, I had with her like exactly kind of what happened to my daughter, and like what I told you and and i've told the group therapy that i've had. They used to be on Wednesdays at 11am and you know you know everyone, like you, my parents, they just like they can't believe a judge would say that to me they can't believe that like you know people have said, like that just needs to be investigated. And, like the whole system, the systems like messed up like CPS not coming out in February, you know and then CPS going to my daughter's mom over here in September and my daughter's mom tells her to say. Your dad told you to say that so yeah it's just like a really. Well, the way away my dad's mom thinks about it is like when the whole me too, and all that was kind of like really going she was say you know. These women, they all wanted to you know have sex with these men they they you know they wanted to move up in their career or whatever, and then. All this stuff happening, and so they say okay what Let me take a shot at the start that's that's my daughter's mom and even her mom. that's their kind of thought on that, like my dad's mom is a site people like women don't get like rates or maybe some do, but for the majority of them, they change their mind afterwards. So that's like just a little light into house she thinks."
760.0,Provider,So i'm assuming you tried to have some kind of a conversation individually with your with your with her mother to to. So that she would prevent. This man from being around her daughter in any way and and you just kind of hit a wall with her to like she denied that it happened or.
13184.0,Patient,"yeah well originally I told her you know I don't want this guy around her from what you told me last spring. But then, after my daughter told me, I would tell her like hey look. she's telling me this. And my dad's mom would say she didn't say that she didn't say that so let's like never even you know, and my daughter was telling me it was when mom was taking a shower so you know. She knows like i'm sure my daughter's mom has a philly. I don't I don't know I you can't you can't like you can sit there and brainstorm all day as to."
760.0,Provider,"Why she thinks what should I yeah. I know, perhaps there's some dramatic things that happened to her, I don't you know I don't really want to get into that I just. trying to get from you, if you made the attempt to like work it out with her."
13184.0,Patient,"I mean. yeah daughters mom like I don't think she was ever like assault physically abused as a child, I think, her dad left her and her two brothers and her other sister. When they were like around you know all of them under five. So I think. You know there's something there with that. You know she can't be can't be alone for like a day she has buddy. You probably you know understand the nuances of that I really don't I think it's like you know somebody just they're not comfortable with themselves."
760.0,Provider,"it's kind of irrelevant because you're going through a trauma as a father you're going through a worry as a father. Is that worry now in the past, or can you talk to me sitting here today, right now, Nick are you still feeling worry when when your daughter goes to see her mom about what kind of men she's got around her or. Well yeah to me about that."
13184.0,Patient,"That so there was a trial or there is a mandatory settlement conference. On the third on last Thursday. So she didn't go to that. Go to that person, the new guy that she's dating. He. I mean I I approved him a little I don't know much about him, so I don't know if I approve him. He approached me when my daughter's mom picked her up back in April, like hey look, you know I take I take my relationship with Cecilia very seriously. And you know this is after already what my daughter told me about the last guy. So yeah I was just like I don't trust her judgment. You know I. it's not really you I don't know you so who knows it's more her you're the third guy in 14 months to be around my daughter feel clued me the fourth guy in 14 months to be around her. You know I think it's very inappropriate I told them for you to share a bed with you know, because my daughter was she has her own bed at her mom's, but I think you know I know my daughter is when she's here around you know 12:01am so coming from bed with you. And so I told my I think is very inappropriate that like you're over there, like I couldn't imagine dating a woman and, like her three year old girl like slides into bed next to mom I just thought like that's very inappropriate how I was raised. You know it's that's just not something that should be happening."
760.0,Provider,"yeah and you know I think you know we can talk about trauma, but you know you your worries are legitimate I mean it's obvious that that your ex girlfriend right now, the wife."
13184.0,Patient,yeah we're experts.
760.0,Provider,"Yes, your ex girlfriend doesn't have a good history with picking guys seems to have something going on, so you know that is something that. it's you know I can't sit here and tell you, you shouldn't be worried about that, because you know if I were in your shoes, I would be worried about that. And I you know not being in your shoes i'm worried about that you know i've never met your daughter, but she's a three year old innocent child and i'm worried about that, so you know the the thing just continue to do the right thing. One thing i'm not an attorney or anything but one thing that I know I would do in your shoes is I would be keeping a log of everything that that transpires on such and such a date at such and such a time, this."
13184.0,Patient,"Oh there's. there's the mandatory cinema conference on. Last Thursday and there's been seven hearings all the hearing, I try to get I get them. there's been through there's was two other mediations. First mediation back in November 2020 is like that's like that's when the mediators split up like the holidays and the time split and all that she gave mom tall more hours a week, which i've gone and i've asked a few times now, can I can we even out the times, but to 5050. You know, you would think that would be pretty straightforward i've asked, can I count, because in California both parents have to agree to take the child to a counselor to a psychologist. All and i've asked for that as well, and the you know the judge is like no she has no business going to one and I told the mom like. Starting last February, if there's nothing to worry about nothing happened we could both find the counselor which are both taker. And moms like i'm not gonna let a counselor put that in our head and I told her like they're not going to go out and like tell her that they're going to like talk to her and there's play therapy like I looked into it, you know I mean Come on, so. There is a trial. On Thursday. And then coming Thursday and a couple of days. yeah so um and then mom didn't go to the mandatory settlement conference on the third she instead The night before the day before she got plastic surgery she got to know shop. And she phoned in saying you know at 9am you're supposed to be there 830 on there at 830 I have I file my paperwork which the last year mom doesn't follow any paperwork. I file stuff. The judge will ignore what I filed mom will say something and it's, as you said, like it's a fact with the mom says she doesn't have to file and then the judge will tell me oh you didn't check the right box. And I say Okay, no, you have to look it there's probably more you're probably looking at the old papers and the judge will say. Okay, and then she'll she'll just like go on a ramble and i've talked to lawyers in this area, and they say okay yeah judgment is very opinionated that's for sure. And so. I yeah I on so this past on the third she she's able to phone in at 9am you're not supposed to be able to zoom in to a mandatory settlement conference, unless you are trial fire authority from the Court. she's able to get through, and this is indicative of the whole process the Clerk in this department kind of goes out of her way. she's a woman she's a older. African American lady probably like 60 years old or 55. She goes out of her way to get Cecilia on the phone. And there's two judges, these are not the same judges i've been going to and seen for the last year, these are two temporary judges. And these three judges, one of them it's a man and the lady both Caucasian both by looking like they're like 60 years old, one of them is saying. We shouldn't let her do this, the other ones I can let's just and they asked me how she'd been to the last court dates and i'm honest i'm the as she showed up to him, and she missed one. But she doesn't file anything, and you know they they kind of just talk and she they talked to her and she tells them. Look um I had an emergency medical procedure yesterday. And I had every intention of going, but that happened and so she just like lies to two judges in open court, and you know. She I told the judges to I said, you know what knowing her, she got plastic surgery she got to know shop I kind of had a feeling she was going to do that because she would kind of asked me for it and I was like you know I helped her I helped her with. laser eye surgery. And you know she has you know, had gotten other work on her just kind of a real I don't know what type like i'm sure i'm painting a picture and you could kind of see it so. yeah she got that nose job and I told the judges this and. They said it's a valid point bring it up a trial next week and I said, you know what I don't think she should be able to phone in right now. This is indicative of the whole process if it was me, I would not be able to zoom in this clerk would not be going out of her way to get Ahold of me. And you know, then the Clerk says whispers over to the judges and they say Oh, it looks like your paperwork is file that daily. your hands are clean and this and i'm like you know what but i'm here and I did file she's not here she probably lying to you guys as to why she's not here, and she hasn't filed anything. And they they were like fair point bring this up next week, so you know I came to my house that our daughter, on Friday, and you know sure enough. She has a bandage on her nose, you know it's all black under eyes and i'm like well they're going to see that I trial, and you know she understands being she emailed me yesterday, I think, was her Saturday saying. You know my my health is protected by hipaa but the thing is what she likes to two ports, I mean two judges in open court doesn't she I think she opened yourself up to like at least like the judge at this."
760.0,Provider,"thing you and you have these are like legal questions you're answering asking me, and you have an attorney."
13184.0,Patient,"No, I don't have an attorney I did have an attorney for the first couple of court dates. Okay, I have an attorney for. you're not gonna have an attorney like I would be literally."
760.0,Provider,"100,000. he's writing I see okay yeah I."
13184.0,Patient,Know i'm like what should I do or anything like that. i'm just like telling you like kind of like I guess i'm talking out loud of what i'm thinking.
760.0,Provider,"i'm not sound it sounds like you're you're going through all this. stuff but i'm hearing a tremendous amount of worry i'm hearing you're focused on all these legitimate worries that I understand why you why you're feeling the way you feel. I don't perhaps it would be a good thing to maybe talk to an attorney if you feel that maybe the the Court is is being in any if you feel that in any way they're biased against you and in favor of her mother, then maybe at least pay for a consultation. I information about that."
13184.0,Patient,I already do.
760.0,Provider,"Okay well you're doing you're doing everything, because we think we have certain things that we can control and so trying to one of the best ways to manage a crisis is to try to focus on the things that I can control. yeah but."
13184.0,Patient,"I try oh i'm you i'm presenting everything like emails, and this is what they asked me they said look. Why can't you to, and this is what they say, like in the findings out the order. it's always best for the two of you to come to some sort of agreement communicate and try to reach like. uh huh before before these court dates before the mandatory settlement conference before trial, you know, and I reached out to her literally like once a week hey look my daughter means more our daughter means more to me than anything, the world. Though like she's such a bright light, can we like put our differences, to the side and sit down and come up with a Co parenting plan for her like she deserves to parents that work together and she'll just like ignore it, she didn't say anything. and her new boyfriend like last a couple of weeks ago, I think it was the Wednesday before thanksgiving I pick up my daughter, and he comes out trying to talk to me. And he's like hey look like I told him like this isn't the time i'm picking her up it's 630 at night. i'm going to go home and make dinner, and he keeps trying to talk to me i'm like look like right now right now and he's like just you know i'm just trying to like can you leave me out of it, like, I was, but then he goes on to say yeah with CPS was here. And my daughter is in her car seat and he's like I don't think she could really hear him but he's like you know they're questioning her and it's you know they're asking her this hat and he's like it's so awkward for her. But and but he's like talking like he's serious he's like you know what what are you doing what do you what why you're calling CPS it's like. it's like I was like really angry and I just stayed cool I was like look man stand your business like I told you this back in April stay in your lane kind of just like. You know, stay in your lane like stay out of it but he's like you know he he told me he's like I, I want to keep an eye on like he's like always hovering when i'm picking up my daughter like he's like. You know, he doesn't he feels like he's insecure honestly and so like the reason to skip the mandatory settlement conference part of it was like he told me like he doesn't like to let her out of her sight out of his sight. When like when she picks up our child he's like you know his car's parked to where he can see like he wants to see so so you're walking up and then he's like. You know it's like dude you don't trust your you don't trust it so you to be okay to get our child, but you want to trust you want me to trust you to be around my daughter half the time like that you don't make sense. And so. You know I trial, I have, like everything, like, I have the last two years of communications i'm going to print out you could like put on an 811 eight by 11."
760.0,Provider,So you you've written all of these. every single one of these incidents you're describing has been written down and recorded and you bring it.
13184.0,Patient,You take.
760.0,Provider,"It to court, you."
13184.0,Patient,"can send it, you can write down all you want it's more of like the screenshots that word for word like that verbatim or whatever like like I could write it down yeah but the screenshots and what she says, and when I say speaks for themselves, I."
760.0,Provider,yeah true.
13184.0,Patient,"And there's my mom picking up our daughter she parsing like the middle of the road to pick her up I think my garbage cans were out and she literally parked in the middle of the road, because I don't know. She wanted to park where the garbage cans are so. Then just other stuff like obviously what I told you back in February. You know, but when I talked to the lawyer, they say some of that stuff is petty you know, not the inappropriate whatever touching at. By the boyfriend but for parking in the middle of the road and stuff like that, but they did tell me bring it up at trial, you know show your pictures show your emails. You know present your case, and you know that's what i'm gonna do I, I honestly don't expect it to come out any different than it's been for the last like. Two per year I think it's gonna we're gonna go to department went 24 judge on Wani isn't supposed to be our judge she's supposed to pick a judge. And um you know i'm pretty sure, whoever she's got a PIC is somebody she's friends with somebody you know she's gonna kind of like they're gonna was gonna be a proxy of her. So I really you know, and on top of it it's like she lied just this last week to two judges hear about she had an emergency medical procedure, she told them. How do you believe anything else that comes out of her head out of her mind I mean out of her mouth, I mean it I feel like like I have an opening statement, and I felt like it's pretty good like I feel like it's. You know it's kind of like putting that in light like Taylor she she says this she like completely lie to you guys, how do you believe anything she says, at this point. So you know, but again like I don't really think you know I don't think i'm gonna get 12 more hours I don't think they're going to even it out, I don't think i'm going to be able to take my daughter to a counselor. I don't think i'm going to get two more hours on a birthday, instead of we only scheduled to get two hours if other as the kid on that birthday, you get the parent who doesn't have them just two hours i'm asking for for so it's."
760.0,Provider,"So you are you. This is a lot of stuff that you're dealing with all this stuff it seems like you're doing everything within your power to do what you can help your daughter to reach your daughter, so are you are you feeling like she's being hurt even now. I don't think she like. or you're just worried that it could happen again if if her mother's start seeing the wrong guy. Or maybe even this guy I don't know."
13184.0,Patient,"Again yeah like her judgment seems to be not that great oh. The guy this guy now like. He seems very protective over sicilia. You know, but I don't think he you know, again I don't know I don't know him. You know if she is just her judgment if that can happen with one person can have to can another person do it yeah I would say so um is there anything now no I don't know if you're asking you this because you're mandated and all of that, and you just turn."
760.0,Provider,"Oh no i'm just i'm just trying to assess your level of stress, right now, your level of worry right now about your daughter."
13184.0,Patient,"i'm just like I beat myself up for handling it wrong in February, even though I called the COPs I call CPS I told the judge and I told the doctor it's like I beat myself up for it, that I did it wrong that I messed up that you know her future. perfusion like I oh."
760.0,Provider,"And what could you have, if you could go back in time and turn back the clock, right now, Nick What would you do different."
13184.0,Patient,"I would sit her down and say look, you have to tell them what you told me, but I was really hammer that and."
760.0,Provider,"Sometimes, if you do that, that there are parents who do coach children i'm not saying that shoe but you know, the system is used to dealing with all different types of parents and and sometimes it's I. don't know if you don't really know concretely if that would have worked either I don't you know."
13184.0,Patient,I mean.
760.0,Provider,I tell you to say.
13184.0,Patient,"Like I don't think two COPs that are like to be COPs that are like, finally catch the guy who robbed the 711 and pulling people over they could decipher it I don't think they could tell if a child was coached or not, so you know it's that initial contact."
760.0,Provider,US needed to be the ones. To do the interview not COPs because they're the ones that are trained for that kind of thing.
13184.0,Patient,"yeah what you someone like you or CPS. mm hmm yeah. yeah so that's why I wanted to get her into a counselor like. My parents. All CPS call the COPs and I said look it's going to get like they're going to mess it up the costs and my dad was like no you tell them to send a female COP out to talk to her, and I said that, then I can almost promise you, they won't i'll ask them, though, and. I just."
760.0,Provider,But even a female COP may not be good at.
13184.0,Patient,"No, but I. felt a lot safer I think if I would have sat her down and been like look you're going to have to like really not hammered in but told her like look honey like. This is your future this is your life you're going to have to tell them what you told me. And, and I think like she would have told these two male COPs that and then they would have sent out detect up maybe it's. Maybe it's a female but it's somebody that has training in like they can tell if a child or anybody is kind of like you know they work with people they could pick up on little things they know. The COPs they don't say is there, like you know their hammers they want to hammer the nail that's it they don't know like. So yeah I you know I just like I beat myself up for that and i'm like i'll never forgive myself."
760.0,Provider,"Honestly, Nick I it seems like you, I mean nobody's perfect and it's easy in hindsight say Oh, I could have done this, or I could have done that, but I haven't heard any hesitation. That you that you did you didn't you didn't stop talking for you talk to her mother you, you talk to the police, you could talk to CPS. You know and you're doing everything. I know."
13184.0,Patient,It was.
760.0,Provider,"You asked me how to deal with trauma and right now, it seems. it's still kind of an ongoing theme, because at the end of the day, your daughter's three. And it's still ongoing it's not like she's grown, and this is over, and you can process on that, so you know, the thing you can do is just keep doing what you're doing, and maybe hope for the best talk to an attorney once in a while. Just to make sure you're doing everything you need to maybe make sure you're like in case there's any ways, you can organize and be more structured with the way you're keeping notes, maybe try to lead with the most significant things. You know, because getting two hours more time. You know, at a holiday or a birthday is not going to. reduce the the the risk that I know is probably the most important thing, and you know underneath all of that, it seems like the thing that you're just worried that you know you're worried bad."
13184.0,Patient,"yeah I mean um yeah the daycare that she goes through, is a family daycare. You know, and she got bit by one of the kids there and and she told me, she was slapped in the face by another kid. But she's friends with some of the kids there, and you know I I worry about her there. it's just um she is so precious and she's a very sweet sweet child. Like my mom came out the other day with my dad and they have my brother has a daughter, and two kids and you know. there's, I have three other siblings one of them's a girl, and my mom just you know she says and everybody says it's like Penelope is. very sweet she's very loving she just hugged my grandma over and over and says, am I miss you they live hour and a half away so it's like three hours both ways. I just how well during coven they're just like worried there. So um you know she just like you know she just says that you're right because I kind of get on to them, you need to come out of senior she asked about you guys she saw you all up until she was two years old. And i'll be out there, like every month. So yeah they you know she's just so so loving and so sweet, and you know I just like it frustrates me a little like that she like she loves people so much that she doesn't get that back from people. She gets."
760.0,Provider,"She gets sent back from you neck. Maybe, maybe, maybe. I hear you that you you're concerned about her mother, but she does get that back from people she gets that back from you, she could step back from your parents. there's people in her life that she gets that back. She gets that back from."
13184.0,Patient,I mean.
760.0,Provider,"And as a parent. You know all of this stuff and I know this, this is a, this is a more worrying, but then probably as many parents go through, but as a parent. I don't think there ever comes a day, where I don't stop worrying because you know, the world is the way the world is and and I try to. You know you kind of you have to do your best at the stage, and right now she's three so she she needs you she needs you she needs her mother 100% because of her age. But I just think it's normal if you unless you're a parent who doesn't care about your child. I don't know how you stop worrying because I still worry, I have a I have a 21 he lives at home here, and I still worried, you know, and I see him every night and and I don't have these these kinds of stresses like you're describing but worry that's just part of it. You know you, you have to understand next that that you're doing the best you can and just keep doing the best you can. Try to focus on the things that are within your immediate circle of control, because when we ruminate about things that are outside of our control like you know in, and I know it's a hard what i'm asking you, because the worries there. For tried to do try to focus immediately on what are the things I can do right now, today. To make sure she stay safe right today."
13184.0,Patient,"And that's what bothers me because I I feel like i've done everything and I keep trying like. It yeah I feel like i've done, I like I really feel like, but at the same time it's like I. I feel like it's just that judge or the like I could get I found the paper to try to get a new judge like a to dismiss that one and that and she denied it like. jojo one he said no i've already, this is already been heard in California, you could ask for the judges to be swapped out, but it has to be before the case has started I kind of feel like I almost become like a best expert and family well, not an expert, but like so."
760.0,Provider,A lot more than you really wanted to know.
13184.0,Patient,"yeah and. yeah they she denied it, she was like no and then she sent me like four papers all copies saying, she denied it and it's just like I feel like this judges has something against me um but yeah I you know I feel like that's why I beat myself up because I feel like. I did as much as I could do only thing is like I tell you is I didn't really I kind of messed up when they came here the COPs. I mean i'll just tell you like in February, she like we're laying watching TV. It was like going to sleep and she like grabbed my hand and like try to put it next to her like you know private area, and I said pay me, what are you doing, and you know, and that was coupled with she was acting out like. Panic yelling and you know but and then she was like always want to change her underwear and I did read about that, like acting now like that, and she was she's always like a very sweet girl always wanting to. You know, like hug and stuff but she was being very clingy like a little mark thingy then she usually is so um and then you know she did try to like in February, she did try to like reach for like REACH, for me, like my plan, I said pain, you know what are you doing and so. I mean."
760.0,Provider,Did you report on those incidents.
13184.0,Patient,"yeah I told it to CPS. And it, you know it was like when I called in February, I told the guy this is what's going on, but I told him my home she told me that this guy when mom went to take a shower. He you know touched her you know her vagina and so you know I told him straight up that's what happened. And you know I even have a video of her like telling me because she started talking to me about it in February. And I just started recording it like okay i'm like I put the camera the phone where she couldn't really see you know so but she's really smart, so I don't know if she knew, she would be recorded, but you know I sent it over to my parents and they were like. You know kind of besides themselves and they were like this is hardcore proof give this to the COPs give this to CPS and I gave the video to the COPs when they came out in February. You know so but I get it, and what I call CPS that I explained the video to CPS and Guy said look it's vague it's vague, so of course i'm going to think it's like concrete. This guy needs to you need to get them right now put them in prison, of course, my parents here think that but from an outsider view the guy said it was vague so. You know, and then and then so they broke up in December I think i'm not sure. You know, but then in June June 28 of this year. I passed by our House, because kind of like where she was living she's moved now, but where she was living like it's on the main road, so you all you do you look to your right, and you can see your House it's like a duplex and that guy victor's car is there, and this is June June 28. And I picked her up that same day, and she is screaming crying and I asked her I said I thought you broke up with him, are you living with artist isn't this guy Ryan living with you now, and she said, oh we we went to the. We went to the lake for the day and I, and I told her I said she's screaming she's crying she pulled down her pants and was like looking at my, but it was just like disturbing, it was so disturbing. And I told her, I told her this I said it, I picked her up at six o'clock and until she went to sleep at 9pm she was screaming and crying and doing like just like pulling down your pants. She said some disturbing stuff I have a phone, so you know it's just like. It I like and I told her and she said Look, we went to the lake he didn't it was impossible for her for him to have molested her at the lake. And there was Rangers around and and it's like I told her I said look he did it already in you know who knows when you were living with she told me about it in February, I like it, I can't believe you brought around this person, and you know she said no they're France she likes him. And I just it sickens honestly it's just it's disgusting. So it's just."
760.0,Provider,"I wish I had I wish I had some easy answers for you, Nick. it's you know we can we can talk about the emotions, but you know underneath all of this, I just I think what you're feeling is normal, I just got to keep doing what you're doing as far as death document in your case and and keep going."
13184.0,Patient,"I mean only thing as bleed into like the rest of my life, like my personal life, and you know."
760.0,Provider,Everything worth. It like what it not.
13184.0,Patient,yeah it's just really like do me off this year so yeah.
760.0,Provider,Is that why you've missed some of your appointments.
13184.0,Patient,"As well like with you, I missed last week."
760.0,Provider,"Yes, that's true."
13184.0,Patient,"yeah I missed last week. It was because it was, I think it was at 5pm and I had my daughter, I was about to make dinner and then again this last Thursday or Friday I knew. My parents came out I didn't know if they were shirts are going to come out. I kind of have to harp on them to get them to come out to see Penelope you know they've only seen her three times in the last year she's been over there twice to their house, so I felt like it was important and they asked me if I could go with them to. yeah you know, because you know she likes to use she has to go potty and I know my parents are like they don't want to have to go into a bathroom and you know it's just they will if they have to. So that's isn't I missed those those last two with you, before that I was, I was pretty good about seeing them all, with Ashley."
760.0,Provider,Okay well well good.
13184.0,Patient,Well yeah.
760.0,Provider,"The thing is, is that I, you know I know you're going through an awful lot if you need to reschedule an appointment. reschedule reach out to us and reschedule that appointment and that that's workable. it's just that you know you're being prescribed the suboxone and and there's certain requirements with that, so I want to make sure that you don't have even more stress, because you know you've got to have certain certain so many appointments and and then the other thing. You know, you need to process what you're feeling I don't know if you see a hopefully you feel any I don't know if you feel any better after I haven't talked about this, or maybe you talked about this a lot I don't know."
13184.0,Patient,I mean we can start talking about some of the area other areas that.
760.0,Provider,"That you're going through, but I would expect this worry to affect your work and and all other areas of your life, quite honestly I don't know how it could not."
13184.0,Patient,"I mean, I sometimes I have a hard time not thinking of it like it ruminates i'm. Okay it's like. Like OCD I don't know."
760.0,Provider,"that's that's the that's kind of a traumatic thing and that's that's that's something that we can work on, we can work on some mindfulness next time learn how to be in the present moment and and you know. Maybe some like I don't know how good you are at meditation if you're not good at meditation there's some easier exercises to kind of slow down the brain processing on that we can talk about that next time I am running five minutes late for my next appointment, though right now. Are."
13184.0,Patient,"You for being a 30 minute appointment, so I really appreciate our."
760.0,Provider,"Well, you go into a lot we'll talk about this next time it's just that, next time, can you, is it. Just reach out to your care navigator and let them know that you can't make it and get it, make sure you get it rescheduled and. Rather than just missing."

760.0,Provider,"Okay, good good."
13184.0,Patient,"it's just um I was gonna ask Kim can we do it every week is that possible, I know, with bright heart it's kind of."
760.0,Provider,um i'm not sure honestly if you feel that you need that I can send a message to your care navigator. To reach out to you and see about that. Maybe you need some a little extra help because you've got a lot of worry in your in your mind right now.
13184.0,Patient,"Just real quick like mindfulness is that, like writing it down. You know journaling and like meditating to stop thinking about stuff."
760.0,Provider,it's more of a practice it's the the two main parts is being in the present moment and working towards accepting of one's feelings.
13184.0,Patient,and
760.0,Provider,"Not doesn't mean you have to and I don't want you to confuse it with accepting things that you know your worries like you know going along or enabling. or letting go of that in any way, but just accepting your emotions right now in the moment it's there's some practices behind that but we'll do that next time. Because i'm running late, I have somebody waiting, but do we have our next appointment."
13184.0,Patient,"I oh yeah I think there is i'm. Sorry um I think there is, I was just checking on the calendar and look. Okay, if there is one for. The 15th at 2pm."
