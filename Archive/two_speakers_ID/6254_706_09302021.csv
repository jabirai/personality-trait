To the rental Office like you know when I turn on the water when get up in the morning, well, first of all, you smell us mail at nighttime in here like Sue each second of all like it it's awful funny like when i'm at home i'm having problems with my sinuses and you know coffin and. spitting up phlegm and stuff at nighttime. I stay somewhere else. Nothing is going on, I. don't have some type of. issue, so I told them there's something going on in my house and i'm smelling a funny smell, and if something's not right in here."
706.0,Provider,mm hmm.
6254.0,Patient,"So, like i've done called multiple times like you could turn on the same water in a bathroom and you smell sewage when you turn on a sink water I who wants to brush our teeth and you got to submit your smell and so each. And I got this i'm in my when you take a shower in the water is running. it's got a like a paneling around my tub. You know the paneling type things around your tub. My youth. When i'm after after you take a shower you you clean down your you know you clean out your tub and. So when when i'm cleaning the walls that that you pressing on it is it's it's pointless of cleaning it, because when you're cleaning it to breeze is coming from a thunder the bottom on on on a sighting other tough type thing and the strip to it they're black so it's mo. And I got to tell me that ain't nothing wrong and they might my kitchen sink I was, I was washing dishes. And i'm like I got Somalians Africans that live above me. So at nighttime yeah my husband was laying here and I told him I said he said he turned off the TV he's like you hear that and is going. Michael washing machine. nine times out of 10 if they don't have one of them portable wash machines to hook up to your sink they washing the clothes, either in the tub they're seeing their tool, it may be, or even their dishwasher because I don't I don't use my dishwasher use my dishwasher once. But then I kept it smelling smelling my kitchen and my husband opened up the dishwasher he said this where it's coming from it was all blue and black in there. Right yeah so how is the bloom black water that's died from your clothing."
706.0,Provider,yeah it's coming down to those pipes.
6254.0,Patient,"yeah so I made a note about it, you know, and then I got a big old sink in my kitchen and like I can do just a little bit of dishes run a little bit of water in there. and take the thing and it takes a long time for it to drain So even if you turn on the garbage disposal instead of the water going down it comes up and then go down. So one time, like, I was. In there and everything just over flooded."
706.0,Provider,Oh geez.
6254.0,Patient,"And the man told me, and it was during the time that you know. I had to go comfort my family from the depths, I called the rental company I waited for the maintenance man to come. And he told me that he was gonna go upstairs check upstairs and he was gonna come back with a shot back to get some of the water up so he never did. Like and then you know, like I said I had to leave I seem that he was taking care of it and that he was going to take care of it and I left, but when I came back home. mill doing musty smell was in my house and that stuff was still floating all over my counter and stuff. So I start throwing all my stuff away. And I called the. rental company and total and I told me they said that um you're supposed to have renters insurance call your renters insurance, so I did, and now they didn't put me in a home for three days up in a hotel for three days but. My I want my that that stuff came into to because I gotten to know Liam in my kitchen, but my kitchen is connected to my front room, so the water got one to some of my carpet in front rooms. And regardless of what I do i've done sanitize my house i've done bleached my house i've done done everything and I smell is still in here, so now it's in the i'm thinking that it's it's down into the the counter topping and it's still smelling you know what i'm saying. it's worked into the. flooring. uh huh for just the water just sat there and not got up. I don't know. Is but you know they need to make this right, because I pay $750 for a one bedroom apartment. You know, if you want me to be a good tenant, then you, you need to accommodate me for something that's going on with these people, because every time I do something or call it in like nothing's getting done."
706.0,Provider,"So, and this is it's like a so you call the rental company as a property manager that you talk to you are the owner who do you talk to."
6254.0,Patient,I talked to the property manager.
706.0,Provider,And they're not getting anything done.
6254.0,Patient,"She said that she asked me for permission to come to my place yesterday. And, just like I told her before like this been going on since the 19th of September, who is going just leave. The breeze and stuff around their house and not do nothing. You know I told her I to majority of the stuff away, you know, and I have family members and friends that has a. booths at the flea market and then on top of him I got kids that support me, you know, so my daughter goes out and give me some you know use pots and pans dishes and she found some at the flea market and stuff and the lady going to me she's like I plugged in your. Your microwave and ran it for five minutes and it looks fine to me well, of course, it's gonna look fine. There, let the breeze something I don't know what was floating around and it didn't look right didn't smell right you think i'm going to use that stuff again regardless if I sanitize it. After it happened, like sparks and stuff was coming out of it, no."
706.0,Provider,"So. Which city, do you live in."
6254.0,Patient,Ohio Columbus Ohio.
706.0,Provider,"Columbus OK, so the city of Columbus should have a. What is it called a building management division in the city, they determine. What the landlords have to do, because there is tenant landlord laws and landlords have to address any kind of issue like water heating. All of those things that are within their building, they have to address it if they don't you have certain rights. That you can then act like you can withhold rent you can do different things you just want to make sure that you follow all of the guidelines, and I would contact this city I would tell them. That you're having difficulties with your landlord repairing things that your kitchen flooded that your things were damaged that they're not replacing the damaged floor that it smells like mold in your home that you're getting sick from it. And they will. Either a send somebody out from housing to take a look. Sometimes they'll send somebody out from the health department to transfer mold because you cannot have certain levels of mold in your home. If the your levels of molding your home or higher than they are outside then that's a problem, and they have to rectify that problem, it is the law, so I would recommend talking to the city."
6254.0,Patient,All to check I was going to ask. Is there a way somebody can test and see if there's. The bridge or or stuff floating in the air.
706.0,Provider,yeah so welcome and they tested. They tell.
6254.0,Patient,your father. You know what's crazy I only got one. Fire fire alarm and is in by my bedroom kitchen.
706.0,Provider,"yeah so the housing department they're in charge of all of that stuff So if you call them and they come out and they do an inspection and it doesn't pass housing inspection then your landlord is the one that's in trouble. But you also want to make sure that you don't have mold. Because, if you have black mold that can cause all that congestion and all of that kind of stuff but long term, it can cause cancer, so you don't want to be in handling all of that either um. You can get blackballed pneumonia I mean there's a lot of things that can happen. But you want to make sure that you can't you, you know if you're not getting any place with your rental property company I would contact the city and say hey. i've contacted them several times, this is what they told me to do I contacted you know my rental insurance they took me out so it could be cleaned up, I came back it's still smiles they're not doing anything I think that there's mold and my home. and You know what are my rights and they'll tell you, and they also might send somebody out to inspected or send out the health department to test for mold. Because they have a test that they can do for mold to see you know how much mold is in the air and the walls that kind of thing. Because that's your only option, I mean if you're if you're going to the people that can do something and they're not doing anything, then you go to the person above them and that's the housing department."
6254.0,Patient,"Well, my my insurance says for me not to worry about anything that they was going to send somebody out to inspect and if this on the housing unit there go go after their insurance."
706.0,Provider,"mm hmm yeah yeah absolutely and they well and that's why, having renters insurance is so important because, then you don't have to fight."
6254.0,Patient,"yeah because it see i'm a tenant now so i'm reliable for any and everything in this part right so like. If I call you and tell you okay hey there was a flood like you're not going to be willing to clean my whole apartment complex, you know my whole parfitt my front room in my bedroom clean the carpet, if you not fill in you know you reliable, you know what i'm saying. So they're all taking up for one another because the maintenance gonna say that she said that she talked to the maintenance man and the maintenance man said that he didn't find no problem at all. Evidently, you did find a problem because I called you on Sunday, before I left and I didn't get a response back until Monday night at 708 that the. problem was solved at 708. hi uh huh. But it doesn't say what he did."
706.0,Provider,mm hmm.
6254.0,Patient,It just says the flood was taken care of mm hmm.
706.0,Provider,"So yeah and keep all of those messages any documentation that you have. Because you know that's just evidence of guests, there was an issue, and obviously there was, and you had to get rid of stuff and. I mean it all comes down to the fact of negligence, if you reported that there is issues with your drainage, and that there's a smell of sewage and all of that stuff and they've done nothing now there's a flood that's negligence."
6254.0,Patient,"And, whatever they do like like when I was complaining about the sewage smell coming from my my bathroom seem like they would come, they would do something they claim that it's fixed, but then turn around and you still smell in the same stuff after a couple of days or. So by. So nothing is. done you ain't doing, then you got the wrong pipe that's in my kitchen sink and what it is, is when you turn on that water and that water's going down in that pipe there's water just sitting there. And not able to drain so it's just sitting there, so when you turn the water on that smell was coming up."
706.0,Provider,"yeah well and I think that there's probably an issue of ventilation to you have to have certain ventilation for any kind of sewage in the home, like you have to have that ventilation, so those gases can leave your home. If you don't have that ventilation, then you can have issues with radon and so yeah I mean I just I really think, yes, your rental company absolutely have the rental insurance company come in and do an inspection see with the Bank, but I will contact the city, because this."
6254.0,Patient,"For you telling me. A big old oriental rug on top of their carpet and she you, you tell me hey I can have somebody come and clean your carpet, but you got to take up your oriental rug and just give me a two day notice that we can just get it clean, because it takes them two days. For them to respond to them or whatever, she says oh you willing to do that, but you you you not willing to compensate for for this stuff being damage to my property."
706.0,Provider,"yeah well rental insurance should cover any property damage. So your rental insurance should cover any property damage in the they feel that they should have to cover it because it was negligent on the part of the property management, then they'll turn around and go after them to be."
6254.0,Patient,"Real she said that she's going to send somebody out to us back and that way I won't. have to worry about coming out of pocket for my deductible, and they just go go after now."
706.0,Provider,Did you take pictures of everything.
6254.0,Patient,"Actually, I did."
706.0,Provider,You do that okay.
6254.0,Patient,"Well, first of all i've never been in this type of situation. The only rental place that i've ever had that I needed renters insurance. And I never knew the renter's insurance, I thought renters insurance just covered, I never really read the fine. print of it, I just know they told me that I needed renters insurance before I was able to get the apartment so I had the renter's insurance, but I never knew it covered like a flood or anything I thought renter's insurance was actually for like if somebody broke into my home."
706.0,Provider,I didn't.
6254.0,Patient,"I didn't know, I was covered under flood, and like i'm covered under a lot of stuff."
706.0,Provider,Like.
6254.0,Patient,"supplied fire yeah or if if I was doing something in here and I got hurt. You have that, too, I never knew that."
706.0,Provider,"yeah so so anytime there's an there's an incident where you might have to file an insurance claim, you always want to take pictures before anything."
6254.0,Patient,"Oh me but I never knew it went after the flood in the man told me he had it taken care of I just thought everything was going to be okay and safe, you know I wasn't worried about nope no policy. coverage or anything like that I just thought all my stuff was saying, you know, and then, when I called it sit there and told him about the smell, and you know that there was sparks and stuff coming from from my microwave and that my. rugs that I had down in the kitchen and stuff was damaged and like I don't have no way to clean on. But, like in and they told me they said that's where your renters insurance come in call your renters call your insurance that they not reliable. So that's when I found out, I was the call my insurance and I called them ask them questions and told them what happened so, then they opened up a claim on it."
706.0,Provider,mm hmm.
6254.0,Patient,"I never knew that or I would have took pictures of the flood and stuff like that. But I got it. I got it. You cut it out Stacy I can't hear you. I didn't hear nothing, you said you cut it out."
706.0,Provider,"So I would contact the city and just give them a heads up that hey this this rental company is not following through with their part of the agreement when you have a tenant landlord agreement that says you're going to pay your rent and that they're going to keep. Your home. livable, which means that they have to maintain certain necessities plumbing being one of them, so. I would definitely contact them and tell them what's going on and let them know that they're you know that you smell mold and sewage in your House and they're not doing anything about it and they'll come out and they'll do an inspection as well. that's who oversees all the rental companies all the landlords everything is the city, the housing department."
6254.0,Patient,When I have to call give them a call i'm off tomorrow.
706.0,Provider,"And that might be just enough fire under the rental companies but for them to do something, because. Nobody wants the city to be investigating them if you're a rental company or landlord you know you don't you don't want to see the city vehicle pull up it's never a good time. city housing inspections is what they don't want because when they come in, then they're going to inspect everything so then like you said, your fire your fire. You fire alarms you should have so in rental homes, like in a House I know for sure you have to have one in every room of your rental home so in an apartment I wouldn't think that it would be any different."
6254.0,Patient,"yeah because, if something is going on in the kitchen. i'm not going now."
706.0,Provider,Until you start smokey hmm.
6254.0,Patient,To come around.
706.0,Provider,mm hmm.
6254.0,Patient,"You know mm hmm. It seems like I said, I have a fire alarm in the kitchen."
706.0,Provider,"yep you should have you should have fire, the fire alarms you should also or the smoke detectors you should also have that. You shouldn't have a. fire extinguisher. In your kitchen typically or someplace that's easily accessible. I mean there's certain housing things and I don't know if it's different state to state and that's why I said contact your city and talk to them, but when they come in, they inspect everything. So you know they're not just going to inspect the issue they'll inspect everything and if there's any violations, then that rental company they're you know they're liable for that. But hopefully you'll get your stuff replaced i'm so sorry, you had to go through that you've had so much going on. yeah. You know, like I said, though your daughter graduated that's a happy say I got married that's a happy thing, but then you had a death in the family and then your apartment flooded so it's like ah. So yeah I mean just keep your head up you're doing great I mean it's like you said you're still here and you're still sober you know, and those are like the two most important things."
6254.0,Patient,Doria.
706.0,Provider,"You know so everything else it will pass you know, but those things have to remain, you know that you're still here you're still living and you're sober. And you have great family support and that's huge."
6254.0,Patient,I got a job and I got a roof over my head so.
706.0,Provider,"yeah you have you have your basic needs met so, you know as long as you can look at it, the upside like that you're going to be just fine."
6254.0,Patient,yeah.
706.0,Provider,"All right, girl well i'm gonna let you get to work, so I don't want you to be late."
6254.0,Patient,"Okay, thanks, a lot i'll see you Monday, hopefully Monday for in group."
706.0,Provider,"Okay sounds great. All right, take care of yourself."
6254.0,Patient,"to learn, thank you."
