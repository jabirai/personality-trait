3912.0,Patient,"All right, every time I try to talk to you there's always an issue."
706.0,Provider,Now what's the issue.
3912.0,Patient,"Oh, it was my fault, I went and tried to use your number directly instead of."
706.0,Provider,"Oh yeah because when because if i'm in another session with somebody else they have to message me so that I know that there's somebody in the waiting room. um because I because I don't see it um yeah it's it's kind of a pain, I hear because people are saying that it takes a long time to get through in the BC sometimes so they like to use that number directly. But that's how i'm notified that there's another person waiting so it's kind of in this last session I had actually ran over because it was. me, it was in crisis so. he's never know day to day but i'm glad you're here."
3912.0,Patient,Have a good day I just feel kind of blah blah blah i'm just. Like depressed.
706.0,Provider,What is the weather like outside. Life does that okay.
3912.0,Patient,super Nice.
706.0,Provider,"So the first thing that I would recommend is going for a short walk and getting some vitamin D so it's going to bring up your mood naturally um sunlight has this weird way of making people feel happier. Right um so at some point, you know just going for a short walk and just fresh air vitamin D from the sun. You feel less blah. This is a time of year, where people. Actually. Have like a seasonal depression disorder, because the days get shorter and so people tend to have that change. In their moods. Have you noticed like during the fall and winter, that your moods get kind of bland down."
3912.0,Patient,"we'll see I like the bowl and Halloween that time of year I like it and it just. I don't know it just. can't put my finger on it it's just been really. Things are just changed in the last year, ever since coven and I think I told you that before, but in our relationship, I just. I don't feel whole anymore, I think I know. what not to do with money, which you know everybody's broke, it seemed like but. i'm just. i'm just not happy. Okay, I mean I am not happy at all about anything. Not that I find the worst and everything, and I know trying to be like my mom or whatever, but I am just literally. Just not happy. And I hate to wake up in the mornings I. don't know."
706.0,Provider,Have you ever taken medication for depression.
3912.0,Patient,"i'm a long time ago, but they had a they had it on me they they had me on that medication supposed to be, and like my hair fellow it was all."
706.0,Provider,"batson. weird I said never heard of an antidepressant making your. hair fall out um I mean, not to say that that's not the case, because I don't prescribe meds but everything that you're describing to me the loss of interest and things that you used to like not feeling happy feeling just an overwhelming. amount of. content and uneasiness. are all signs of depression and I almost wonder if you were to take an antidepressant if you would feel differently about things."
3912.0,Patient,"Oh no, no, no, no, have liquor stores or tomorrow, I have a like a happy person in my life, you know me and her. army and her kids are the kids. I just. I don't know. Like i'm not gonna. hurt myself or hurt anybody else not kinda like i'm ready to give up on life mm hmm but. I just want to go to sleep and I wake up."
706.0,Provider,OK. So those are what are known as suicidal ideations. So you know wishing that you could go to sleep and not wake up.
3912.0,Patient,"I mean more in a dream world kind of thing like. That now trust me, I am horrible suicidal i'm more than anything."
706.0,Provider,"yeah no i'm being suicidal suicidal ideations are two different things, suicidal ideations or just thoughts of you know. I wish I just go to sleep and not wake up or this world would be better off if I wasn't here those kinds of things actually being suicidal has to do with actually having a plan and intent."
3912.0,Patient,Road think that you have.
706.0,Provider,"So or not, but you do have this feeling of uselessness and happiness discontentment and those are all signs of depression and so. If you are on an antidepressant or I wonder if, maybe that's not something that needs to be looked at again and obviously not the same when you were on because that did not work well for you."
3912.0,Patient,Right and i'm going to talk to my primary care. going on for a little while and.
706.0,Provider,"You know a lot of people had a steep mental health decline in the last year, this was a lot for people to handle. They were all cooped up together in one home couldn't go anywhere, please shut down people last jobs, people have their work cut people got sick. Or at home, I mean it was it was a lot, there is a there's a lot to be said for the pandemic and the steep decline of mental health and people and the increase and substance use disorders and people. Because that's how people decided to cope with it, they couldn't go anywhere, so they sat home and drink or whatever it may be to cope with all of the negative. You know it's, not that this is a very common issue for a lot of people coming out of the pandemic that they have what we what we refer to as situation. and You know. It may be that you need to take something short term."
3912.0,Patient,To kind of run.
706.0,Provider,"Through this time. or it may be something that you need to be on more long term because you actually have an imbalance of chemicals in your brain. You know it's just. You know, in your in your PCP and you can talk about that, and you can also talk about that. With your medical provider to you know through. You know it's just you don't want to keep on going the way that you're going, because things aren't going to change unless. And you're taking your you know your suboxone you're going through your therapy you're doing group so those pieces, you know you're all you're doing well and you still are feeling the way."
3912.0,Patient,It.
706.0,Provider,All leads to the fact that there's a chemical imbalance.
3912.0,Patient,yeah sometimes you know when I feel like the best example I can give you and I don't know if you were ever an addict but. I feel like i'm on a on a constant come down.
706.0,Provider,"And and. One yeah and when you come down your chemicals are all like this, because you put a bunch of stuff and so then your body stops producing it, and then you took the stuff away. And then your body is still not to producing it so then it's having a lack of that chemical so and when you when you use over so long your brains."
3912.0,Patient,consistently then.
706.0,Provider,"Your body will stop producing it, because it's like oh it's already here I don't have to produce it so, then you do that for a long time and your body stops producing that chemical. i'm like dopa mean, for instance, and so, then all of a sudden, you stop using and you take that chemical out of your brain. Your body still isn't going to produce it, because it's so used to it being there, so now you have a chemical imbalance and so a lot of times when people stop using they will down the line, have a chemical imbalance."
3912.0,Patient,I lost the sound.
706.0,Provider,back.
3912.0,Patient,yeah there you go.
706.0,Provider,"Okay, so did you hear what I said about the long term use what it does to the chemicals in the brain."
3912.0,Patient,"The first part and then. we're. not start over, but you know."
706.0,Provider,"Okay, so basically long term use causes your brain to change the way that it makes the chemicals, and so, if you are sticking a chemical engineer brain through using. Your brain will stop producing that chemical because it's already there it's like well I don't have to produce it it's already here. So then over time you're using you're using long period of time, then all of a sudden, you stop you take that chemical out of your brain. Then, your body says well it's not here but it'll probably back so i'm not going to produce it and then after a while they'll say oh shoot it's not here, I better produce it. But you still have that imbalance, because it hasn't been producing that chemical for so long that can be dealt with me and that can be serotonin that can be. A multitude of different chemicals, but if you have that imbalance of chemicals you won't feel right because those are all the chemicals that balance out your moods that balance out your sleep that balance out your. Your appetite that balance out your anxiety and so, if all of those are out of balance, then you're going to feel very uneasy does that make sense."
3912.0,Patient,sexism dumpling that's how bad.
706.0,Provider,"yeah so that that's what I mean, so you have lost desire to do the things you enjoy that you used to enjoy doing. And so now, you have to balance those chemicals back out to see if that is going to bring back that pleasure. You can also damage the pleasure receptors of your brain the pleasure area of your brain by using and then you, and then you have to take medication to be able to line up those areas again. Does that make sense, because they're damaged, so they don't light up by them, they don't buy it up on their own. So you have electrical signals in your brain and they light up like you have an input impulsivity one a pleasure one there's all these different. If you damage any of those areas of the brain so they don't light up on their own, then you have to take their medication to help them light up. So that could be to it might just be that all those receptors have been damaged and it's. visit took a situation to put you into. kind of a dark place, and now you can't pull yourself out of it, because you are missing those chemicals."
3912.0,Patient,Those.
706.0,Provider,Those electrical signals.
3912.0,Patient,No more toward to my primary career and she was she yeah.
706.0,Provider,"Definitely, but you're hitting all of the benchmarks, you know, the last of interesting things you used to love the loss of energy, the loss of desire to do anything. You know the the feeling of uneasiness the feeling of not being happy, you know all of those things are all signs of depression."
3912.0,Patient,can't wait for it.
706.0,Provider,"yeah so typically when you start an antidepressant within two weeks, you should notice a difference and then after a month, you should be stable at the dose. If you're at the right dose you should be good at either out 30 days, you have to have an adjustment, because things aren't great. Then you have to give it, you know that time to have that adjustment, but um I would definitely get Ahold of your PCP and make an appointment as soon as you can. Because nobody wants to feel you know that way they were you don't want to get out of bed, where you know what want to wake up. That. way to live at all. yeah you need to start finding some more some enjoyment in life again."
3912.0,Patient,I will. Make sure. You probably get an extra. Meeting out of me this long.
706.0,Provider,"You know, whatever you mean i'm here."
3912.0,Patient,i'm here and I do appreciate it.
706.0,Provider,"yeah no absolutely um. I know that you said that you aren't having thoughts of suicide, but depression can take you on a steep decline really quick So if you ever do have those feelings call 988 that's the suicide hotline. We don't want anything to happen to you."
3912.0,Patient,"Well, you have my word that's not gonna happen."
706.0,Provider,And if you get into a dark place and you.
