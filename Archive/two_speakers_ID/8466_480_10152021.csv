He is annoying me he. is going active and. Moving to the east coast. So he'll be in North Carolina. yeah so um I had to make a trip to see him because he's not going to be coming this way when he leaves so. I can made some money working or the other day on a gag and like I put some gas in the tank I was like I have to go see him before he leaves like I will feel bad if I don't go see him. If he's been my friend through so much yeah we've really grown up together so."
480.0,Provider,So he doesn't hang out did you.
8466.0,Patient,"know we just hung out and shot the shit and we had a lunch date I took him to you all so again is you all. and What else lunch date was good, and then I went and had some alone time I myself I just went into my sister's apartment complex and rode my yoga mat out lay down did actually did some reading. So I took some alone time got some reading in and kind of reset after seeing shane because my sister can be a lot and I have had lots of like thoughts in my mind about her significant other jaron. Okay, and."
480.0,Provider,"Jackie, this is the other one."
8466.0,Patient,"yeah, this is the middle sister. She lives in San Diego. there's a lot of history between Nicole, and I because. When when Jackson, I moved in with her and San Diego. Her and jaron were broken up."
480.0,Provider,Okay.
8466.0,Patient,"And then they were getting back together and she left me and jack's in the House in San Diego and move to temecula and then like their whole thing with their relationship, you know getting back together whatnot. So lots of history there with her my sister obviously and then also with jaron so I like took some time and, like really thought about because, like i've been thinking about like the compassion that I have to have for Cole. And I think about jaron. And I had a really nice moment some time alone with jaron and I was able to. apologize to him for holding him to a higher standard than I hold myself for not having some understanding of his own personal life like he has an army background, he was stationed he was military police at Guantanamo Bay."
480.0,Provider,wow so he's got trauma he's. done alone so much drama he's got his own shit you know and like.
8466.0,Patient,"So I was really able to like have a moment with jaron and be like I don't even know your story. You know, like, I am not your significant other, nor do I want to be, nor do I want to know your whole story really. I don't need to know, but the fact of the matter is is that, like, I know that I enter I tried to interfere in their relationship, because I didn't I don't like turn haven't like German. yeah but, as somebody who has also been through trauma and ptsd like I cannot even begin to imagine the things that he saw or did you know. yeah so yesterday you had this conversation with him."
480.0,Provider,yeah wow that's awesome.
8466.0,Patient,"So I had a really nice quick little conversation with him was like you know i'm really sorry for. Being a Dick you know not having any compassion for you and for your journey. yeah. And like thanks for being good to my sister my sister seems happy and that's what matters. So that was really nice and I was like we're good he was like yeah we were always good I was like I figured but like. I was like i've been going through some shit my dude. And so I like I didn't show him any of it, but I was explaining to him about trauma and trauma responses. was like wow that's heavy shit I was like. i've in Chapter three it's been a year. You know, so he was like yeah."
480.0,Provider,"wow not know. Because it's so heavy there's no way I made it to Chapter three this week. i'm kidding myself thinking, I was gonna make it all the way through Chapter three no didn't happen."
8466.0,Patient,So so much and like I made it. I made it almost through Chapter three. But I had to stop. So how far did you make it.
480.0,Provider,"So I only made it through Chapter one I stopped after Chapter one because it took me like three different days of revisiting it. Because, like you, I like to highlight, I like to take notes, I like to really let it sink in and i've been using this book in all of my groups this week because there's so many good points and i'm like Oh, I need to tell these people this thing."
8466.0,Patient,"All right, and there's another level to it for you, because of what you do yeah it's not just reading it for yourself it's reading it in my context i'd like how am I going to use it with my group time I could I use it with my individuals yeah so yeah yeah if."
480.0,Provider,"You saw in Chapter three I did like just. Look, through it, just to make sure I knew what was happening in Chapter three, you said you made it almost all the way through."
8466.0,Patient,I made it to 104.
480.0,Provider,Okay.
8466.0,Patient,I stopped where it gets to betrayal by intimacy. yeah.
480.0,Provider,Good good.
8466.0,Patient,And I do need to go back through betrayal by power on because I didn't do a ton of highlighting I feel like it gives us more examples than it does like. I don't know so i'm going to go back through betrayal by power because I was reading at my sister's House there was TV on and the dog and.
480.0,Provider,"yeah distractions. yeah, what do you think stood out the most so far from chapter."
8466.0,Patient,"My notes, so far, two pages."
480.0,Provider,wow. yeah yeah like the warmth and intention figure.
8466.0,Patient,"I was looking at that yesterday yeah I didn't spend a ton of time on looking at the figure, because it breaks it down in the text. Okay, but it makes sense. yeah yeah So for me I it's not something I took a lot of notes on I definitely did a bunch of highlighting on it, but um. It was something that like makes so much sense I don't question it I don't need to take a note on it, you know what I mean."
480.0,Provider,it's also like common sense to you because it fits so well with your experience.
8466.0,Patient,"yeah and I can when i'm thinking when i'm reading through i'm not ruminating i'm not Reminiscing because I was thinking about this like how am I going to describe it, because i'm not ruminating and not Reminiscing I am remembering."
480.0,Provider,"Yes, that's exactly it."
8466.0,Patient,"yep I am i'm remembering situations relationships situational relationships, you know what I mean like those work relationships that talks about. And I can plug in play different scenes in my mind that i'm remembering relationships and such into the text and be like okay that makes sense because of I went through this with this person. You know the thing that I think, right after that stood out is the people who come from dysfunctional families in which there was abuse or trauma are particularly vulnerable to seduction. And the boundaries that prevent most people from being deceived or not there."
480.0,Provider,"Yes, yeah because you never learned boundaries because. They were number shown to you like they have healthy boundaries."
8466.0,Patient,"And then, it says a person will invariably seek out people who would do them harm or betray them on page 95 I just put Lol. Oh."
480.0,Provider,Well that's me.
8466.0,Patient,"huh. yeah The other thing is it brings back, like the stories that we tell ourselves so like five ways that promises are used to betray us The first one is the betrayal by seduction. You have to believe in the story, you have to believe in the person believe in the dream believe in the mission, and so, for me it was like. I was able to bring back and remember things from my relationship with coal for each of these things. yeah so for like."
480.0,Provider,"belief in the story and it's that. So when you're reading through this whole book, are you mostly focused on coal or is it."
8466.0,Patient,"For the most part, for the most part, but I mean. At this point, like that's a choice. yeah you know, like I could use my entire life and like that's something that amy and I talked about before I started like how am I going to frame this in my mind and I left it open because I didn't know you know so it's like. it's coming out as it's mostly coming up with Cole I do have other instances that I can think of, I choose not to because there's been reconciliation in those relationships, you know, like the relationship with my mom and relationship with Cindy you know. there's been some reconciliation there so it's like. wow I can apply what i'm learning to the relationships I don't need to go back and do the work. The hard work. On it yeah."
480.0,Provider,that's it that's the difference like you said with your mom and Cindy you've already practice setting boundaries with them and voicing your needs and. All of that so like that's part of the repair work is different interactions with those people that have traumatized you with Cole there hasn't been an opportunity to have different interactions.
8466.0,Patient,"I have desperately been trying and he refuses to be open to it. yeah so for like belief in the story like I remember when pull like when we would be asked about well how did you meet or how did you start dating it was this like long, complicated story of our relationship and we were like. Through. A web of connection and a web of connecting situations as reasons for other situations that led to the sense of the relationship. So it's like this."
480.0,Provider,"Again, tells read that again a web."
8466.0,Patient,A web of connecting situations as reasons for other situations that lead to the status of the relationship in that moment.
480.0,Provider,wow that's deep.
8466.0,Patient,"that's some fucked up shit dude. and belief in the person cold got angry when his credibility was questioned or threatened, there would be bursts of rage. rage ranges control and then after a while I would be like I should have pulled him on I was like you just have to recognize i'm just smarter than you. I told him that. It didn't hurt you. yeah and he was like you're fucking right, I was like I know i'm like idiot. So. Could you quit fucking screaming at me. And maybe. Listen, because i'm trying to help you not sound like a jackass. So then he had me checking his work."
480.0,Provider,Really.
8466.0,Patient,"He had me checking his work. And he would do. He would ask me about a topic and i'd say maybe you should research that. researcher. And I showed him how to do some Google research and like I showed him how to use the Google scholar like research it and so he I would go to work and he would be home and he would research, whatever it was even researching usually we need. And I would come home and while I was cooking dinner, he would go through all this research and i'd be like yeah that sounds good i'd be like no that doesn't sound right what's your source on it like. And I would check his work for him. belief in the dream, it was supposed to be the family that I never had. yeah and it ended up just repeating what I went through in a lot of different ways yeah and then the belief in the mission, it was us against the world mentality and call had made you believe, and I let myself to believe that he was all that I had."
480.0,Provider,yeah.
8466.0,Patient,"And so it's the stories that we tell ourselves, but then it also talks about how it takes both parties, it takes the abuser the person spinning, the story, but then the other party has to be willing to believe the story."
480.0,Provider,"Right, the other person buys into that story, as if it is back even though and that's what happens with that kind of abuse is like it's constantly undermining our own intuition and our own knowing so then healing is remembering what we already know and reconnecting with our intuition."
8466.0,Patient,yeah. So it was SMILEY shit the betrayal by terror. Terrible terrible.
480.0,Provider,"So what does that mean, like the rage like stuff like."
8466.0,Patient,"So, each one brings in the previous so betrayal by terror brings in return betrayal by seduction into it. Okay, so. If you cannot achieve your goals by seduction there's always terror. Right fear mobilizes and deepens attachment escalates attraction and arousal it product provides addictive intensity and obsession it keeps behavior secret it's very flexible and can be applied in a variety of situations."
480.0,Provider,So that would be more convincing you that you have no one other than him.
8466.0,Patient,What.
480.0,Provider,"Would that be more than like convincing you, you have no one other than him because that's fear base."
8466.0,Patient,"yeah that's how it works best when coupled with seduction it says on page 98 at the very top. If the seduction is a powerful storyline the terror can be executed it actually bring people together or the terror can be excused and actually bring people together. If the story is strong enough and well told the victim of terror can also believe that he or she deserves it created, it has to endure it and is part of it, and that I have highlighted. yeah like bold highlighting I have like a thin highlighting and then, I have a bold highlighting as a bold highlight."
480.0,Provider,That the bold one the big. huh yeah so then do you have an emotional hangover today from reading all that yesterday. yeah yeah.
8466.0,Patient,"yeah and I had plans to go to a resort tonight and like. I was going to see Doug again, who went out on a date Wednesday night time great guy nice guy we were going to go to the one of the resorts over here, because his house is getting he flood carpet things. hotel renters insurance hotel yeah so we're going to go to one of the resorts, and I was in the mineral bows and I had to tell him like I you need to rain check it's too much too soon, I can't do an overnight tonight with you it's too much just in like I can't."
480.0,Provider,good for you boundaries I love it.

8466.0,Patient,"Doug is 50. Okay, and he is a teamster for stater brothers."
480.0,Provider,You know it's funny when I hear the name Doug I think of a 50 year old. girl.
8466.0,Patient,He calls himself dirty Doug it's circle.
480.0,Provider,"Oh, my gosh. Dirty and like a sexual way or a not clean way. or both."
8466.0,Patient,"All of the ways he gets it like he's been through addiction he's been through mental health stuff like he gets it yeah he's like gone through a drug induced psychosis and come back from it, you know."
480.0,Provider,wow he came back from it that's huge. yeah.

8466.0,Patient,"i'm or like when I want i'm ready. No, no. I need to get STD tested anyway, like I need to get the results back like there's no rush, and then you know and like he was trying to be respectful and was like. Because if we were going to be staying overnight, he was trying to like figure out what the boundaries were physically, you know, and I was just like I don't want to be intimate like. Know like consider, I have a chastity belt like know. Like I want to make sure that, like i'm good before I do that because, like I don't want that to be a problem. You know I mean. yeah so yeah and then he was like Okay, but like ended a like that, like in high school you don't like third base it was like bro.

8466.0,Patient,And overnights are a lot I.
480.0,Provider,"really wanted me I was just talking to my friend yesterday about that I said i've decided i'm not doing any more sleep overs because there's a lot of factors. to it, most importantly, I, like my bed, and I value sleep right and then, if I only have a couple nights a week where I don't have to wake up to an alarm and you know I just i'd rather just not do overnight so i've made that rule for myself with dating i'm not doing overnights. there's no reason, like, I can go see you. yeah and we can have fun and then I can go home to my own bit."
8466.0,Patient,yeah like a fucking grown adult.
480.0,Provider,yeah exactly I love.
8466.0,Patient,"You. i'm like I, like my little spot here yeah you know and like that's another thing too is like i'm not inviting anyone over here. This is not a hangout space, this is not a hookup spot, this is my sanctuary this is where I go to reset my energy, this is where I do my therapy. Its right. place, this is my safe space, and I am not inviting people over not even inviting them over to the pool to go away yeah."
480.0,Provider,Good.
8466.0,Patient,did not like don't even drive into the QA. When you pick me up you wait on the street.
480.0,Provider,"Good I love that. Oh yay good for you. So call Doug. Now, maybe, or just chores straight to chores."
8466.0,Patient,"Probably straight to chores because i'll feel better when chores are done because, like it gets. cluttered very easily."
480.0,Provider,yeah I can imagine.
8466.0,Patient,"But if I just like. takes 20 minutes yeah it takes 20 minutes, not even."
480.0,Provider,And then anxiety is completely gone i've already let it be for three days like.
8466.0,Patient,"I was gonna put it off again today, for you know."
480.0,Provider,"you're inspiring me to just do the laundry just do it, I that's my that's my kryptonite is like my laundry pile. Every week and I put it off and put it off and put it off."
8466.0,Patient,"Okay, so this is my Mr T book."
480.0,Provider,Your prison wow.
8466.0,Patient,"So its moral recognition therapy. Okay, so this is the book that I did and rehab. And i'm page. Page 9899 I have it highlighted and underlined."
480.0,Provider,"Oh, my gosh that's a bold."
8466.0,Patient,"that's how you know. Many people spend more time avoiding so it's talking about. Talking about the ordinary simple things, one of the most basic facts about life is that by enlarge our lives are lived in ordinary simple ways. yeah so we take it as warrior dual. LIFE has many day to day issues in which we must contend meals close. Right chores the mundane is kind of what I thought of it, the mundane the monotony of life right. So many people spend more time avoiding the mundane than they would, if they just got it done."
480.0,Provider,yeah absolutely hundred percent.
8466.0,Patient,"And so, for me. Like when I think about it's like I will spend exponential time. exponential amount of time avoiding procrastinating whatever you wanna call it know. exponential you know, but if I just get it done it takes 20 minutes, not a big deal."
480.0,Provider,yeah. Every Sunday for me. And like hours to motivate myself to do the laundry which I think is going to take all day and then it takes 20 minutes.
8466.0,Patient,"What right, and so, then think about it this way, if you if, instead of spending the time Dreading the monotony Dreading the mundane. Before the mundane and then you have a little bit of time after. You just get the mundane done first, then you have all that time."
480.0,Provider,exist.
8466.0,Patient,yeah so all that time before Dreading the times. could be. relaxation meditation doing whatever the Fuck it is you want to do instead of Dreading the task beforehand.
480.0,Provider,yeah and another trick for me is finding ways to make them and then fun right so music dancing doing something new to make it not so mundane listen to the podcast something like that so it's not as terrible.
8466.0,Patient,yeah I found us neuroscientist on YouTube I really like Andrew huberman.
480.0,Provider,Going written down.
8466.0,Patient,Let me see I.
480.0,Provider,Like ah you.
8466.0,Patient,yeah I think I may have a link in my. clipboard let me see because there was a two hour podcast I listened to it was really amazing. I took notes on the podcast it was so good.
480.0,Provider,I love podcast so much.
8466.0,Patient,I don't know if it's the swarm. i'm not gonna do that. Because it was so good. He was on ritual. You know that is.
480.0,Provider,i've heard that name recently Why have I heard that name.
8466.0,Patient,"I don't know. But here's the link to the one that I watched so you can at your leisure it's a two hour and 15 minute podcast. So on but I guess, yes, but it's so good, I took notes on it."
480.0,Provider,"wow Okay, I have it up on my browser i'm going to add to my favorites there we go."
8466.0,Patient,yeah. yeah my other notebook. podcast notes.

480.0,Provider,And neuro plasticity.
8466.0,Patient,takes focus and sleep.
480.0,Provider,Okay.
