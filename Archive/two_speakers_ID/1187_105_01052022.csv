105.0,Provider,"I think for individual therapy is not an issue for me. Okay, but in group, you may not be letting group is my concern. yeah give you a hard time."
1187.0,Patient,I need to remember to keep a pair of my car if I ever can't get home in time. How is your new year.
105.0,Provider,"Oh, just so sweet, you know just. Just really. optimistic."
1187.0,Patient,yeah.
105.0,Provider,I hope it's better I hope it's better. than. I do.
1187.0,Patient,girl. it's been a month i've been like counting down the days to talk.
105.0,Provider,"Well, let me, let me here."
1187.0,Patient,I got coven.
105.0,Provider,Oh gee.
1187.0,Patient,"yeah I got it from a client, but so like last month is just kind of like a blur like it's a. I missed like two weeks of work and. The holidays were quiet, I was able to I was better by Christmas time not quite 100% but. So I got sick. My my mom. She. She does. She does it every year every holiday is like. Just kind of like anti Christmas. No one ever like that, when we were kids like when we were kids. We were around family and. We celebrated and it was. A fun time and um. But she'll she says things. And it's like. So I got sick probably mid by mid December, she was telling my daughter. I don't know if i'm going to come down for Christmas, I think your mom needs to rest, we need to give her time to rest and it's like. don't start using that excuse you know, and I knew the second she said that I was like she's gonna try and get out of it because, so the deal was we went we went to chris's for. thanksgiving and then she was going to come spend Christmas with us, but. So when she said that, I told my husband she's not gonna come for Christmas and that's Okay, because I don't want to be stressed out I wanna I want to enjoy the holiday and. But then I still found myself like in moments thinking like I wish, she was here like I wish, she would have come, it would have been fun to have everyone together but. She. Probably like maybe a week or so maybe not even maybe a few days before Christmas. She texted me and then I was like So what do you are, you still planning on coming for Christmas and she's like um she said no, I decided that i'm not going to travel for the holidays. i'm going to stay put this Christmas i'm really having a hard time already i'm having a hard time and i'm feeling really sad about the holidays and I said i'm sorry i'm sorry you're sad. I said and I told her, I wish, she would come, but I understand I told her I understand. So. She said. Like I didn't hear anything from her, but then on Christmas Day, she tell she texted my husband and said. He texted her wished her Merry Christmas and then she replied and said Merry Christmas. I hope you enjoy your I hope you enjoy your family and watching each other open gifts. She said enjoy your day with your family and. And remember nothing's forever and it's like. Okay that's and that's like one of the things that I had talked to you about before that she would always tell us nothing is forever don't ever forget that nothing is forever and it's like right I get it, but what are you trying to say what was out about. So. I didn't so shortly after she texted I called her so that we could all wish her Merry Christmas, so we could talk to her and, of course, she didn't answer the phone. So. Later, that day she texted me and she said, thank goodness for family for for family and for my friends who hold me up and support me during this time i'm just so sad and. i'm really grateful that I have good friends to help me and i'm like, but you have me like you have your family and the end like when will it be good enough like when will it be good enough for you to. She makes it sound like she has nothing like she has no one and i'm still like him here. But when she says shit like that it makes me not want to um. I don't I don't feel like stroking her ego I don't feel like telling her oh we're here we're here I don't I don't. want to play."
105.0,Provider,it's manipulative and you know I get it.
1187.0,Patient,"yeah so I haven't talked to her Glenn haven't talked I didn't they reply to that text on Christmas Day, I I just I haven't spoken to her, since then, and she hasn't tried to talk to me either. But it's like I don't even know. I don't know what to say she'll she does that even when my sister was here, even when my sister her and my sister would hang out and then my mom would say the same thing oh i'm so glad we have at so and so that we can go. You know celebrate with or and it's like I know I know she doesn't like my husband's family, I know that she doesn't care for. Being around his sisters or his dad and we weren't even really around them over the holidays, we kind of just did our own thing but. But even knowing. That, if she was going to come, like his uncle invited us over for Christmas to you, and even then, I was like I don't know if I can commit because if she's gonna be here she's not going to want to go so then i'm going to have to. decide, am I going to stay with her. At Christmas Eve or am I going to go with you know to his uncle's so it just makes things like difficult when. Like and that's part of the that's why I was like well i'm kind of glad she didn't come, because then I don't have to worry about shit like that, and I can. enjoy my holiday, and I can spend time with whoever I want to spend time with and not have to worry, you know about what is she is she going to be okay with that. So."
105.0,Provider,"Familiar you've been here before. Really familiar pattern with her. I heard something new, when she said, I feel sad that was. That seemed kind of like clean and it's delivered."
1187.0,Patient,yeah.
105.0,Provider,"She ended it unfortunately you know, with some nothing is forever stuff but. You are still quite susceptible to the beat."
1187.0,Patient,"yeah. yeah I thought I was doing well, I thought I was doing good with. yeah."
105.0,Provider,"Can you see your way out of it, right now, are you still kind of. In the thick of."
1187.0,Patient,"I mean, I guess it's still it's still."
105.0,Provider,feeling you're feeling the i'm not enough. yeah it looks like it.
1187.0,Patient,yeah.
105.0,Provider,And she is a wizard. Making people feel what she's feeling.
1187.0,Patient,"Right. Like my husband said, well, maybe Maybe she just needs to like keep wallowing in whatever you know her grief or whatever it is that. makes her feel like she can't be around us or doesn't want to be around us like I don't know what it is, but he's like Maybe she feels like she just needs to be still in that place so. I don't know if it's grief I don't know I don't know if you because she acted like this before like. And she would give me the comments of enjoy your family have fun with your family and it's like. Like I said, like I don't, but you are my family too and but I was over, trying to. make her feel good about anything."
105.0,Provider,that's progress. Right yeah I mean that's that's something you know. We got to enjoy the holiday and do your own things there's an upside to this.
1187.0,Patient,mm hmm.
105.0,Provider,"And still, it would be nice if she didn't throw out the bait."
1187.0,Patient,"yeah. I don't. And I don't want to say anything to her to make her feel like she has to. Come like you know what I mean like. Like if I say like well why am I not enough to. spend your holiday with I don't want her to feel like oh shit I better I better do that next year, so that. You know. cuz then that's not genuine either."
105.0,Provider,"Well that's you're getting into a tricky little spot because. it's. it's still activating for you. And what you're doing in simple terms, is trying to control. Trying to control her behaviors no one likes to hear that and I risked saying that out loud. But you deal with that. Honestly later on. The one to deal with is the one that's happening now, the I. I feel. sad that you're not here, I pictured you being here my kids being here my husband being here and I didn't get to see that, and I would have liked everybody to be here and play games share a meal. And there's something about Christmas that I want Sam be around them all want to be around all. So I missed you. And hearing about friends and hearing about other extended family or other family that is there for you. is confusing. Because you were invited here."
1187.0,Patient,"Yes, see that's what I couldn't they couldn't put it into words of it like, how can I tell her how I feel. Without first without being mad and defensive and like. I knew that you would give me some clarity, because I was like I don't know. How to say this to her, but Okay, but I interrupted you."
105.0,Provider,"you'd like say give me. The best feeling true feeling like there's some some truth to it. So right, we will meet put aside and we asked anger to step back, which is there it's good good stuff. But underneath it if we spend, we also stopped trying to control and predict meeting predict, because you do know likely how she's going to behave but that's where you'll stop yourself. from being. able to do. A lot of what's actually been working for you over the last couple years with her, which is staying authentic again and again and again when I watch, we have a little time that jeff's apart and you come back and it drifts away. It drifts away because what you don't get is you'll be there you'll be there, the next time you'll be there when she says Oh well, I know I absolutely have to be there next year."
1187.0,Patient,Right mm hmm.
105.0,Provider,"You get to do it again, you get to Okay, maybe discuss will show first maybe resentment and anger will show up first push it aside oh what's this thing I do i've got. To get clear not interpret that's the bait if I interpret what that means i'm lost to this pattern, but I can say mom. I feel sad thinking that I. manipulated you in some way last year. That I somehow. That year you're wanting to come this year is because you want to alleviate guilt. truth of the matter is, I want you to want to be around me. Pure life and I can't hear that, with the coat and layer of. guess, I have to well. As your daughter, I want to be wanted pure. And as a mother, I imagine mom you want to so wanted to, we may have more in common. Any anything else, on top of that is confusing for me and I don't know what to do with the Meta communication So those are underlying communications below content. So you can go back to simply put mom. Was there a part of you that wanted to hang out with us for Christmas. And America that didn't."
1187.0,Patient,mm hmm.
105.0,Provider,"Do you to struggle with an inner conflict that they are almost in opposition. Do you to struggle with that because I to do, I wanted you here and I missed you and a part of me was glad to not have burdened you with hanging out with my husband's family I didn't have to be conflicted with taking care of you emotionally. I don't like this conflict. I like it, I wish it was different what mom do you go through the same thing, like you, almost want to opposite things sometimes. that's. isn't that life."
1187.0,Patient,"mm hmm. It really is. yeah. yeah she got me. because she said the same text to like all of us, and like different words you know, but all of all of it said, everyone to everyone is a enjoy your family like. Like we're strangers like where someone that she doesn't know."
105.0,Provider,"Caroline there's another and I everything I just said is true there's another another layer to this, which is in its face value, without interpretation. enjoy your family How else could she say it enjoy a family enjoy listen closely listen enjoy the family enjoy our family enjoy my family enjoy family and you remove the article altogether, how could she write that. How could she wish you well, you tell me."
1187.0,Patient,yeah you're right.
105.0,Provider,"that's just another angle at it. mm hmm and I saw I was listening to it, I was hanging in there hanging in there, I was like that could be just the filter but then the thing right at the end is the gotcha."
1187.0,Patient,mm hmm.
105.0,Provider,"nothing's forever and, but you are ready, your eyes, because of your childhood your life is scanning all the time it's always scanning to confirm that she is this woman. And i'm so sorry i'm sorry she actually does the thing that you're scanning for okay be i'm sorry that you had the unmet needs. But what you forgotten that you've had in the past we've been able to get a good strong hold on is opting out the interpretation."
1187.0,Patient,yeah.
105.0,Provider,"Because men and i'm kind of teasing right i'm playing with the articles in a sentence and i'm just taking it like this and i'm breaking it down and i'm saying. at any given moment, you could just hear it, the way I just said it, which is. Love my family oh my gosh, let me tell you what she did, and my daughter did this issue so funny and you can't believe bubble, the one I wish we had to see this and then, and then we went over here, but I have no doubt that. What you didn't. But you could have. And that's opting out."
1187.0,Patient,yeah.
105.0,Provider,"heck yeah enjoy my family. I just I know I wish you were here to have seen it to. Maybe next year, maybe next year i'll ask again period, no games and no thinking ahead saying Oh, but then she's going to be a martyr and I can't do with martyrdom next year. And I was able to believe that she loves me enough and oh so much trying to sculpt this future a year from now. Fuck it. yeah I call that too much effort too much it's so heavy and look what it's doing it's breaking you. hurt so badly that's that old hurt little girl. she's doing it again doesn't see you doesn't see what she's doing it's cruel."
1187.0,Patient,"yeah. yeah. Yes. Okay, I know what to do. I knew what to do, I just didn't do it, I got she got me."
105.0,Provider,"This is an old one, she makes you feel not enough. I takes an artist to do that."
1187.0,Patient,yeah.
105.0,Provider,yeah like i'm not I mean think about what all you have you could grief in you have so much richness you.
1187.0,Patient,yeah.
105.0,Provider,he's the one that doesn't have enough. really what close friends does she have really what what does she have. She has passive aggression companion.
1187.0,Patient,mm hmm.
105.0,Provider,"she's missing out. And you can be compassionate for their company her you can feel sad and say I want you to hear. All defenses aside excuses aside lots of good reasons we can all come up with i'll just be alone, but I want you to your mom. I just want you just know that and, yes, it can be complicated so that's what we do family does show up."
1187.0,Patient,yeah. you're right.
105.0,Provider,"She will have to twist around in that stew of. Now, how do I contort the simple plain truth. That will stick around it'll take some time and figure out a way to to do it and you just. spit it back out."
1187.0,Patient,"Yes, I."
105.0,Provider,"have someone told me that they what is it called what kind of fishing is that, where you have to have to you have to fly. fly fishing fly fishing. You have to pull it yeah."
1187.0,Patient,it's. Good. luck man. I like that okay.
105.0,Provider,"yeah. spit it out. she'll be okay. she'll be okay you don't have to do this particular game she'll be all right. you're changing the roles she's keeps using the same old rules but i've also heard that she's she's dabbled. Like I feel sad is a direct communication. she's gambled. And you have done a lot, you said a lot of boundaries, will be the last couple years a lot of boundaries with her she's fine she did not fall apart."
1187.0,Patient,mm hmm.
105.0,Provider,it's okay.
1187.0,Patient,"She is okay. Okay. i'm gonna call her. I mean I can't I can't tell her these things on a text I need to talk to her and. get your the air because, like I said she has tried to to contact me even like on new year's day I felt like. I don't know I felt like dreary on new year's day I didn't feel. optimistic like you were saying. And like my husband will reach out to her more than I do, sometimes, but he likes wish her a Happy New Year and. she gave him like a generic. Thank you, same to him I don't remember was pretty. Basic. Just kind of answered his. And I was like I don't I tell them I don't I still want to talk to her and I don't want to say Happy New Year, but like it's not real for me right now and it's does it feel. sincere and i'm just not going to do it, I don't feel."
105.0,Provider,authentic so don't.
1187.0,Patient,know.
105.0,Provider,Talk about things you want to talk about. yeah. Any concerns that during that conversation she'll Fuck you again.
1187.0,Patient,"yeah I am always. I always have the. Like you say always counting um. let's see I think i'm going to get her with the. Like. i'm confused because you. say you know you. You you have these people friends, whoever that you're glad you have them but, but you were invited to come here, you know and and we're family too, so what what happened with that and I think I think i'm going to get her with the like what you said about. Is there a part of you that didn't want to come, or were you conflicted you know. And then maybe another part of you that did want to come. Because I kind of felt the same way, and I think she's gonna be stumped when I when I tell her like. I know you didn't want I know there's a part of you that didn't want to come and that's okay like I get it, but. But I did miss you, you know. It would have been fun, it would have been nice. So."
105.0,Provider,"What is the outcome, you want so from the conversation."
1187.0,Patient,"I want to clear the air, because I know there's a there's a. there's a fix something lingering because we haven't talked to each other and i'm just like I like I haven't tried to reach out to her, she hasn't tried to reach out to me either I don't know if she's talked to the kids or not, but. I wanna. I want her to know that. When she does those things it bothers me."
105.0,Provider,see if you can figure out how to say what the things are.
1187.0,Patient,"see if you can find it. When she. When she tells me. That. i'm so you know i'm so glad I had so and so here, thank goodness for my friends and. And it's like well i'm your family too I. Like you're saying that you."
105.0,Provider,All of those are going to fail try it this way.
1187.0,Patient,Okay.
105.0,Provider,Right try different way.
1187.0,Patient,"Okay, and."
105.0,Provider,"Because this is one of those situations where someone else that's not scanning. would hear i'm so grateful to have friends and family, but you can't hear that so just just own it first I feel what, what do you feel when you hear Thank goodness for friends and this family over here, what do you feel."
1187.0,Patient,"I feel like chopped liver, I feel like not. No."
105.0,Provider,i'm not included in this word friends and i'm not included in family and therefore you are not grateful for me.
1187.0,Patient,mm hmm.
105.0,Provider,"Is that right. yeah Okay, so it helps to really identify what it is that you interpreted but own it Caroline you interpreted that."
1187.0,Patient,yeah.
105.0,Provider,"She did not make you do anything. yeah if you can get this far, what you're doing great."
1187.0,Patient,yeah.
105.0,Provider,This is hard because that's not how it feels it feels like you know manipulation and they're making yes man.
1187.0,Patient,Project and.
105.0,Provider,"All of that. But you interpreted it this way, you can say that you can say mom done any intention so anything about this, but it really messed with my head. And my heart and I interpreted Thank goodness for friends and family, since she didn't come out here, I interpreted it as i'm not included in that gratitude and I felt unimportant dismissed and unloved and sad and so confused."
1187.0,Patient,Okay i'm writing this shit. Yes. cuz you're right i'm i'm interpreting those things. i'm turning them into something that.
105.0,Provider,"Maybe you're writing something down the meaning I made. Out of that tips, thank goodness for friends in this particular family, since it didn't say. You daughter. mm hmm I made it mean. That you don't feel welcome that you don't feel loved and then I have failed you in some way. And it triggers old not enough experiences and beliefs of my childhood now we're going deep. But you decide, you know that's the ownership, whether you decide to say it or not, the awareness can be handy what you elect whether this person has the ego strength or not is up to you, but at least you can see what the narrative is inside, you can label it. and explain where this came from."
1187.0,Patient,Okay.
105.0,Provider,And she gets to correct you.
1187.0,Patient,yeah.
105.0,Provider,"She gets to say no, no, no. At worst you're blowing this out of proportion. You exaggerated worst something like that dismissive. you're being ridiculous or that's just silliness I was including you, what are you talking about and then you get to say again it's important that i'm telling you this because i'm sort of like looking at this new year and. I don't want this confusion. In the coming year. Can I interpret that what was your intention with it."
1187.0,Patient,Okay.
105.0,Provider,"what's the meaning right what's the meaning behind it, so that I can really learn how to interpret because I do I get offended and hurt and wounded, sometimes with texts and come to find out it isn't what you intended, and I want to get it right. You see how everything i'm doing is mean ED i'm going to do this, how do I interpret what can I be doing. Is she decides to apologize that's icing on the cake she decides to say yep. Part of me resent that you didn't beg me beg me drive up here and pull me out of the House in my underwear and dragged me for Christmas i'm gonna say it. But."
1187.0,Patient,And that's and that's and that's what I wonder if I pissed her off initially because I didn't do that when she said i'm not going i'm not going to travel i'm not. i'm having a hard time with Christmas this year anyways and i'm just gonna stay put I told her okay i'm sorry that you're not feeling well and I understand I didn't.
105.0,Provider,But she still did you did not split the bait out completely.
1187.0,Patient,it's no. It did.
105.0,Provider,"Because you would have been able right, I can animate this farce it's a farce it's it's a it's a it's a child's move."
1187.0,Patient,uh huh uh huh.
105.0,Provider,it's not mature it's not nice to make people feel guilty.
1187.0,Patient,No. know.
105.0,Provider,"The most you can do is do this with grace. Again in this minute and then again and then again it's unlikely she's going to be doing it with Greece, but you can."
1187.0,Patient,You can.
105.0,Provider,"yeah well that doesn't sound like me that doesn't sound like mine i'll think about what you're saying long, but that does."
1187.0,Patient,yeah.
105.0,Provider,I don't think all of what you just said it's me but i'll think about what you said I don't you know. Not all of it.
1187.0,Patient,yeah.
105.0,Provider,"Well, think about it."
1187.0,Patient,that's a great thing to say. Like okay. i'm not gonna argue but yeah. Not gonna let you hook me.
105.0,Provider,"And those words that can be useful are simply. All of that doesn't feel like mine, in total, like. But some of it, maybe i'll give it some time."
1187.0,Patient,mm hmm.
105.0,Provider,It doesn't become a you're bad you're wrong. i'll think about it and and really. it's modeling what you would like her to do to.
1187.0,Patient,Exactly.
105.0,Provider,"If you decide to go into parts language. I want you to know that some of what you were saying, and here is really interesting I was asking you how do you want this to go and you were saying i'll get her get her with this."
1187.0,Patient,"Because. because she always has a fucking come back she always has a way to twist it and, like and make it my fault like make it, you know still take no ownership take no ownership of anything."
105.0,Provider,But the gotcha will fail she's the artist. Your new business okay.
1187.0,Patient,"she's been doing this, a."
105.0,Provider,"long time she's gonna win, but what you get to say and here's the grace i'm so confused. yeah i'm confused on hold on i'm trying to put it in a category where it's just 111 thing and it's almost like this almost like two contradictory things I just want to ask you a question, do you want this think this field is believe this. And Jen one of them out. Because it needs in land I just heard two contradictory piece of information i'm confused, I want to, I want to clarify something really quick before I make some big old meaning out of it."
1187.0,Patient,mm hmm.
105.0,Provider,"And that you can stay right here i'm confused i'm confused right, you can do that again and again."
1187.0,Patient,And again yep.
105.0,Provider,Because what you normally do. Is you don't stay confused you just go ahead and resolve it by blaming yourself. yeah so stay in it longer.
1187.0,Patient,Okay.
105.0,Provider,"And involved evolved relationship you'd be able to say those things boy i'm starting to blame myself right now i'm starting to feel responsible for your feelings are you know wanting to rescue you from those and fix you you don't have that. That you can say to anyone really i'm a little confused, how is that against social norms, I think we can get away with that can't wait. Yes, you can be confused not piss anyone off."
1187.0,Patient,that's totally. that's a perfect way and it's like you say it's graceful it's not like. You know defensive it's not what the Fuck is wrong with you like it's like.
105.0,Provider,here's the problem it's I make it look easy.
1187.0,Patient,I know.
105.0,Provider,"Year good and not recognize the confusion your your anger happens quick she said again she's doing it again do it again. yeah you're going to need to catch it catch it in the body of six throat tight chest gut wrenching okay what was happening, am I clear about what this does this did this woman just answer my question. yeah she didn't okay Okay, what do I get to do I get to be I get to be confused I get to ask. Oh yeah that's confusing the meeting and making out of that or how I interpreted, that is, you want this is that is that accurate, I just want to be clear."
1187.0,Patient,yeah and you don't get that over text.
105.0,Provider,"Oh, you know this is verbal because. You, and you, and you know i'm watching you today with these pigs sighs of relief because you've been having to navigate all of this interpretation yourself. And you're not checking it out. For her trick, like so many people is to have contradictory things. that's the trick and how to resolve it as a little person you weren't allowed to get clear you weren't allowed to check that out. But you're in a big woman's beautiful woman's body you're in this adult body that gets to say I don't want to take any chances, I want to make sure I understand what you're saying."
1187.0,Patient,"Are you saying you want to come out here, but."
105.0,Provider,"there's no room for your sadness mom like. we're sad too, but it's this sweet and sour thing salty and it's like it's both like we can be around if you end up crying and we can also acknowledge."
1187.0,Patient,yeah.

105.0,Provider,Okay well.
1187.0,Patient,it's helping me.
105.0,Provider,"All right now, this one is very much surrounding the topic that we just talked about which has to do with I want to feel comfort isn't safe when I communicate with my mother. My evil. So how to do that will decrease from 00 sorry from one to zero activation and communication, so you don't want any activation. it's a big ask I gotta tell you. This, I wonder if it's even reasonable and can I tell you. My so I haven't met anyone that doesn't get activated. Right what they do, what people do is is more about how quickly they remember how to stay centered, how do you stay honest how to catch."
1187.0,Patient,The best. That yes.
105.0,Provider,So what you did was a big ask.
1187.0,Patient,What was the question again.
105.0,Provider,"So why don't we do this, so your goal is, you said, I want to feel comfort ease and safe when I communicate with my mother and I would like to change the objective because you've gotten to see it in real time that it would may have been an inhuman. hey. I mean don't even get activated by your own husband and he's a lovely man, I mean. How are you gonna do that with your mother."
1187.0,Patient,Oh that's like actually fucking laughable.
105.0,Provider,"Okay, but we got here by way of I went ahead and adults Jeff. And wrote it down but. No, I like that was a big ask So what if we. Did more about. This palpable a way that you can measure time now I know you're not gonna go Oh, is the inside coming off it's still not here, I know we can't measure it quite precise. You may have a vague general sense of you know what she did it a few times this month and. 50% of the time or 80% or 90% of the time I was able to think rationally and I was able to. Talk about what I think what I feel, what I want. feeling guilty ashamed and angry."
1187.0,Patient,mm hmm.
105.0,Provider,"So those you might be able to measure over a month period of time, do you think you could. yeah okay so try and figure out it percentage and again we're trying to get somewhere so don't go to zero, all of a sudden."
1187.0,Patient,"Okay, so I want to be when is the question I want to be activated or."
105.0,Provider,"So this is what we're. we're doing an increase so we're going to do is client will increase and trying to figure I like increase versus not do. Is we can't control, so much the not dues, but if you were to see yourself remember yourself doing particular things when you're activated what would those things be."
1187.0,Patient,Those things would be. Like taking a breath.
105.0,Provider,Take a breath and what.
1187.0,Patient,We try to step back and. Think about what it is that activated me. What exactly was said or done i'm. Not. Let not let my anger. Control my actions. use my tools and and. not play the game spit it out.
105.0,Provider,"yeah so but notice that to do so. You notice I keep trying to push you to the do so, it will be. I, so the spitting out part is to not interpret that's what that."
1187.0,Patient,"Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes. not interpret."
105.0,Provider,"And I know i'm saying not there's another fancier way to do it, but I think."
1187.0,Patient,Like asked questions. miley like.
105.0,Provider,"Asked sure so ask questions when conflicting information is presented. Yes, yeah there we go uh huh."
1187.0,Patient,"Talk about it take it further, and not just internalize."
105.0,Provider,"not assume and interpret but, once you get confused you'll recognize it first from anger or guilt or shame you'll notice that say okay. Let me do some other use some other parts i'm gonna use the parts that asked questions i'll be assertive clear confident compassionate i'll ask questions when I am confused. Yes, okay."
1187.0,Patient,Yes.
105.0,Provider,Okay now let's get a percentage over the next month. So let's take an average month How often do you get cooked for a longer period than you like How often do you get hooked.
