107.0,Provider,Hello. hi.
6377.0,Patient,"Yes, I forgot to do the SMS check in today."
107.0,Provider,it's not a crisis just do it when we're done.
6377.0,Patient,Today was the day I had five appointments.
107.0,Provider,and yeah I remember last time I was just thinking that i'm like I think today's got a very Emily as a very busy day before our session so.
6377.0,Patient,"Yes, I did have time to do it, but I don't even think it was on my to do list so."
107.0,Provider,No worries that. You can do it when we're done.
6377.0,Patient,"yeah you always have the same meeting ID. yeah. One of the appointments I had today, I was supposed to call for a referral for the appointment and I didn't do that and I was able to do it after the appointment, so I guess I people are just being lenient with me, which is, which is find."
107.0,Provider,tis the season.
6377.0,Patient,"Yes, so. I guess so."
107.0,Provider,So so how's life.
6377.0,Patient,"it's kind of crazy um. Well, actually it's kind of clearing up from a craziness I guess like Friday was like the peak of the craziness. Sometimes I was seeing when things are going well, I think about how like. I enjoy it, but I know that it's not going to stay this way um. And I I don't know why I remind myself of that when things are going well and then like when things start turning i'm like see things don't stay this way um. But yeah a bunch of things just piled up and none of them were big problems, but they all. were really there were so many things that it just became very stressful. and on Friday I got a letter from the school. Saying that they changed their policy on how the reporting code before they would tell us when there was a case. Just if there was a case in the in the school that the kid was in which was perfectly reasonable to me and now they're only going to tell us if our kid is someone who's deemed a close contact. And my kid was saying, one of my kids said. That that one of the kids in his class, who said that coven isn't real is now out sick with coven and I said Oh, is that mean you're going to quarantine and he said no, because he doesnt sit at the same table as him. So we're not even going to get a notice, as far as I know, so I spend a lot of Friday drafting angry letter. which I did send. Like be really upset. Because I don't feel like I have the information you need to know if my kids are safe and I also like spent a lot of the day, looking into options about pulling my kids out until the unvaccinated ones and till they're vaccinated. And, in the end, I decided that I didn't want to do that, they don't want to do that. I. doing everything I can to make them safe I bought a ton of Cayenne 95 masks not the end 95 but, like the Chinese version but, like the good kind of like Angela Merkel, whereas these guys really good kind everybody ton of them, and my unvaccinated kids were those they're pretty good. So. Much as I can do. Then, on Monday morning, one of my kids had a cough. And so I interrogated all the kids about symptoms and one of them had enough symptoms, they give two of them home on Monday sign them up for Cobra deployment. On Tuesday and interrogated kids again about coughs and two more had enough symptoms, that I kept it all home and the other two got tested they tested negative. So that was all like I don't know, maybe because I was just overworked about everything, but. yeah. And then, this is the week of so many appointments and then we missed a bunch of them because. The kids being out with mild symptoms. And those appointments are now rescheduled for December, which is. Because that's where things are. So."
107.0,Provider,stressful.
6377.0,Patient,"It is stressful it is stressful. And, last week I got the paperwork, because my kid has to be like re certified for disability, which last time I did all this paperwork, I had pretty much as much time as I needed. Before I submitted it, and now I have a deadline that's coming up like in a couple weeks and I just got the paperwork. And it's a lot of it, and a lot of it's like essays which i'm overly perfectionist about a. Draft and then I look at it, and then I correct and I sleep on it, and then I go back again and I make sure I have everything I need like it's a college paper I treat it like a treat government forms like a college paper. But I feel like that's a large part of how my kid got SSI in the first place was I basically one that essay competition of describing his ability so well that they understood what it was. So that stressful. And then school starts next week and I was looking forward to that um. But then I also have a ton of seasonal stuff that I have to do. Switching out clothes winterizing. cleaning up the yard for the winter putting all the summer recreational stuff away."
107.0,Provider,So i'm overwhelmed is whether really start to hit for you guys. It buries right it.
6377.0,Patient,"knows around, so no just knows it for Halloween. But I can do outside work into December. Pending on the temperature like there's usually still a couple of good daisy to weaken into December."
107.0,Provider,"So that's why i'm just saying like yes it's stressful you've got a lot on your plate, at the same time it doesn't should not have to all be done next week, like you got a little bit of time."
6377.0,Patient,"Like the pool is only has emptied but not dismantled it actually just finished emptying today and I felt really silly about it because today's the first day of August, but then I was thinking like there's not a rule that it has to be all put away by the first day of bye bye in summer."
107.0,Provider,"Right. it's okay yeah yeah. So what is the theme for summer, the theme for summer was. sunshine sunshine. For fall, the fall of raising."
6377.0,Patient,The power.
107.0,Provider,that's right. So you know raisins got you know racing still sleeps quite a bit so they're not i'm progress.
6377.0,Patient,info yeah. Not so much yeah he's he's fighting with the diet right now. yeah.
107.0,Provider,reactive right so go go go and then crash for a little bit go go go so maybe you look us raising as an example.
6377.0,Patient,Just just a second.
107.0,Provider,Go ahead.
6377.0,Patient,"Okay, so i've got my big dog behind me now."
107.0,Provider,pillow.
6377.0,Patient,"because she forgets that there's lots of places she could go that the little dog can't harass her. Little dogs trying to harass the village I can't get up you. know. Yes. raisins a bit of a handful but, just like with the kids i'm the most boring person brazen can put play with so. that's kind of Nice. yeah I do want to get him nicely trained. And he's very fit right now."
107.0,Provider,he's in that stage.
6377.0,Patient,"yeah I told the kids he would do this and they couldn't believe someone was so sweet but go through such as stage, but here, he is biting everything but he's so sweet. yeah the fall surface stressful because I feel like a lot of it does have a deadline like I haven't sorted out my fall clothes yet. So i'm still wearing my spring dress my summer dresses with today I wore my summer dress with a long sleeve shirt under it like a three quarter length sleeve. shirt and took it off when it got too hot so now i'm just in a summer dress and I feel like that's silly but I don't know how to. put my own things at the top of the to do list ever."
107.0,Provider,Why is that.
6377.0,Patient,"Well, because. it's it's never the most important thing there's always I don't know like I can deal with not having like come December. i'll if I don't sort out my clothes i'll have dug out enough that i'll have a complete wardrobe or at least complete enough. piece by piece, but that's silly and also like not a good use of time, so I don't want to do it that way, but yeah I don't know. I don't know how to change that."
107.0,Provider,Can you actually like create it to do list where your stuff happens first.
6377.0,Patient,"What whenever I have like a habit to do lists and the stuff that's like really only affects me. always gets pushed down i'm looking at it now this it gets pushed down until end, like other things just keep on bumping it down from the get down buffy down. Well, my staff is on there it's all on there."
107.0,Provider,"Well that's good. So maybe. Maybe part of your homework assignment between now and the next time we meet is that you move some of your stuff. higher up on the list, and you don't let it moved out. You pin it."
6377.0,Patient,"Okay, so like. first thing I have to do in the morning. is one of the tasks that's mine and then I can go through and do the other tasks."
107.0,Provider,There you go.
6377.0,Patient,"or even like just a half hour. Instead of completing a task because some of these are big tasks now half hour. of me tasks i'm going to write this down because i'm looking at my to do list, instead of. And I can't really take notes just in the to do list. Okay. Now I have to put a note into my to do list."
107.0,Provider,No worries.
6377.0,Patient,"I don't have a problem with prioritizing my recreation time like at the end of the day. I usually like to play video games or watch TV or. Something like that. yeah something that's not important, I don't have a problem with that it's just. That tasks yeah yeah sometimes I have had a problem but lately. i've been doing well. And today during one of the appointments there I knew there was going to be a gap of time, where I was going to be waiting in the car. And I actually brought the Nintendo switch instead of bringing paperwork, because I thought I could make some headway on this paperwork, but that's going to make me feel stressed now just hated. So I didn't want to do that. Because we're at the dentist's office and I get scolded when my kids are at least I don't I didn't get school today at all, but I get scolded enough that I I get anxious when they're at the dentist office for the scolding that's coming."
107.0,Provider,Because they brush their teeth or floss enough or something you get scolded by the dentist.
6377.0,Patient,"Well there's this one hygienist. Who is quite sure I should be brushing everyone's teeth. And she had my youngest kid today who's a really strong pressure and so she didn't tell me, I should brush his teeth, but if she had had the other kid she she would have told me, so I was really thankful for how that worked out."
107.0,Provider,"that's ridiculous one of my good friends, is that I just she would just cringe have shared the story. But you know what people, what are we going to do with them Emily people are people that just do weird stuff we all have our motivators and things that we get all worked up about I guess."
6377.0,Patient,yeah. And it's like a it's like a low income. Community dental place so I can't imagine that i'm like the worst ones they get so she must have quite a long day if she skulls.
107.0,Provider,"or she feel safe schooling you because she can't school, but other people."
6377.0,Patient,Maybe maybe. yeah.
107.0,Provider,"So life is a little hectic right now, but it sounds like you're managing it."
6377.0,Patient,"Well, I don't have any more appointments until next Wednesday and that's just my kids regular horse therapy appointment. that's really exciting for me."
107.0,Provider,Good. You can take some time to decompress and prioritize what you care about right now.
6377.0,Patient,yeah. yeah. yard work and plumbing. yeah. that's what that's the plan yard work tomorrow plumbing on Friday.
107.0,Provider,"So our leaves different colors but not on the ground, yet, are you already having dessert raking."
6377.0,Patient,"I don't really believe in raking. But they are falling huh. Okay, we used to have cheese by the road, and I would have to rake those because they'd get covered in sand, but now we don't so I don't I don't break."
107.0,Provider,There you go well.
6377.0,Patient,"Because we don't always get snow anymore. For like huge parts of the winter, but it's still cold so. Leaving that on the ground is like a little blanket. For what's there."
107.0,Provider,"got it. yeah, this is the purpose So there you go."
6377.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
107.0,Provider,So how are you doing what's going on for you how's sleep still going okay how's day to day stress.
6377.0,Patient,"we're just going really well. As long as I. When I when I go to bed i'll fall asleep, but sometimes I get distracted and don't go to bed. If I go to bed before 11, I consider that good. After 11. Not so good. I think most days i've been getting in bed by 11 I still wake up well before six most days, but not too much before. So that's I guess that's. six to seven hours of sleep so that's."
107.0,Provider,Not terrible yeah.
6377.0,Patient,"One thing i've been working on is not eating healthier, but like eating yeah and because that's that's almost never my goal. But cleaning up my eating habits trying not to eat in the evening, unless it's a dairy product because dairy products make me sleepy. But like not I don't know like chips, so I can have yogurt and I don't have ice cream or anything like that, or maybe a slice of cheese, but. try not to snack in the evening a couple years ago I lost 80 pounds. And i've been thinking about that a lot, I mean, I guess, I think about it a lot anyway, I ate 1000 calories a day for about a year. yeah i'm and i'm. Everything it's not I weighed every everything that went into mouse I weighed it and I logged it. and Did it did good like. But it's not healthy whenever I try to eat that little I can't do it. For more than a day or two. But then like if I set a more reasonable goal I kind of don't take myself seriously. So I thought I instead of having like calorie goals, where i'm weighing my food. Which isn't healthy any I don't think it's healthy for me i'm. Looking at habits that aren't healthy and trying to have those goals like snacking at night because i'm with adderall I never have breakfast unless even, even if we get good breakfast food i'll eat it around noon. And then I but I rarely have lunch. And then I usually have like a big supper and snacks in the evening. But as the adderall wears off, I can put away a lot in the evening. So, having that cut off the week when the kids go to bed I don't eat anything unless it's going to help me fall asleep. Like yogurt or a cup of milk. that's been going well. I did finish up a package of cookies last night, but that that's God i'll be good."
107.0,Provider,"So it sounds like we're developing a theme of you taking yourself more seriously. Maybe your to do list. And then your self care it's not that you haven't been doing that, but I think you need to kick it up a notch."
6377.0,Patient,"yeah I think that no I don't think I am taking myself seriously, but I think i'm seeing that not taking myself seriously isn't good for me."
107.0,Provider,you're having some negative consequences.
6377.0,Patient,"yeah and that those and, in turn, affects the things that I do take seriously."
107.0,Provider,"There you go. we're back to if you don't take care of yourself, you can't properly take care of others and that's super annoying but true."
6377.0,Patient,yeah i'm gonna note that duck that sounded like something I should knock down. that's something i've got to think about is.
107.0,Provider,"Do you think something is silly as a sign up that says take yourself seriously would be helpful, or is it just too silly."
6377.0,Patient,"Let me, let me, let me just pan around So you can see. Okay, this is my decorating style."
107.0,Provider,Okay. So.
6377.0,Patient,would be fine.
107.0,Provider,might get lost.
6377.0,Patient,I don't see myself focusing on it.
107.0,Provider,a ton unless it's neon.
6377.0,Patient,"and large and a lot like I, this is a lot of this is kid artwork kid blankets, that they want in their little corners lot of it is neon actually. neon printer paper that stuff gets printed on. stand out."
107.0,Provider,"Well, something new noodle on what's going to help you stay focused on your self care, you know what's going to help you take yourself seriously, maybe it needs to be at the top of your to do list. That that's, the first thing you do, and then you do your thing and then you do others, you know i've had a couple of clients lately I think they're all talking to each other, I don't know how that's possible but. it's a thing out there in the universe, so people are starting to write down their intentions for the day. Okay, and a journal and and they found it to be very helpful to write it down because you know i'm a big fan of the writing and and it doesn't take very long and it just has really helped them kind of set the tone. So maybe that's something you can tinker around with and see if that's beneficial."
6377.0,Patient,All right. I intentions for the day.
107.0,Provider,It does need to be 12 them like one or two. One and maybe the. One maybe one of them is always. Take myself seriously and. Because I think you'll automatically translate that to whatever it needs to be for that day.
6377.0,Patient,I put on my screensaver on my phone I put a quote that says no one knows no matter of exam anxiety makes any difference to anything that's going to happen and seeing that. Every time I turn on the phone makes me think about like what it is i'm anxious about Is this something that I can change or Is this something I should just discard isn't worried because that's you know those are the two options. So maybe I can replace that. With something about taking myself seriously when maybe.
107.0,Provider,"Sure, create some form or have like a rolling a screensaver you know when. Your tech savvy enough, you can. Maybe have some rolling. messaging."
6377.0,Patient,"or just a notification. I did, that a long time ago with like an affirmation thing. yeah so. that's. yeah that's something I can do pretty easily. engines thing. that's. that's a good way to like focus the day. there's a lot of times I have a bunch of stuff that has to be done and I don't know how to decide what to do so, I start by doing what I call my dailies the things I have to do every day. And then I just go to the most urgent thing, but then like today, I was working on the pool and I realized I needed to. Do this thing with the House real before the winter, so I completely stopped with the pool which wasn't my to do list and did this whole Israel project, which is now done never on my to do list. that's that's ADHD but."
107.0,Provider,yeah.
6377.0,Patient,I forgot what I was trying to.
107.0,Provider,say I get distracted.
6377.0,Patient,yeah.
107.0,Provider,"One day, I have lost in your in your to do's and then you get you know your to do's become more what you see as opposed to what you to do."
6377.0,Patient,"But the deciding one day I had to do the dishes and I had to put away the laundry. And I didn't know what to do, first, I could not decide what to do first it wasn't like one I dread it and the other I didn't I was fine doing either, and I just couldn't decide. And so I gave each of them a number one into, and I did I said, Google choose a number between one and two, and it chose one, and then I did it. But that intention that. would give me that. direction at the beginning. So if if the dishes were in that direction that'd be what it what's, the most important."
107.0,Provider,"Or you know however me. hello, you can make it work. let's see what happens."
6377.0,Patient,Okay. So she reschedule the next one.
107.0,Provider,"Yes, ma'am and because I am in my mobile unit. I am going to trust that my schedule is free in three weeks, can you just give me the date and you tell me if that works for you, and then, when we in session will schedule it and i'll send you an email, for some reason I can't do it, but it should be fine."
6377.0,Patient,"Okay, is the 13th."
107.0,Provider,"All right, does that work for you."
6377.0,Patient,yeah i've never busy it's seven o'clock on a Wednesday. You just talking to you.
107.0,Provider,"Alright awesome so the 13th of October 7pm Eastern standard, I will see you then. Okay luck with your endeavors."
