And then, like up to like the exam how to study for like another quiz or something. And I was like oh my God, this is my second time we're taking it and then, when I go to to the university what am I going to do struggle like I don't like i'm so tired of struggling right. And then I started panicking i'm like should I even go to like to the university. And i'm like I don't know if I could handle it like cuz like we talked about like the stress makes me so sick, so I took my exam a Monday right and last Monday, but I threw up on Sunday Times of stress right. And then, like. cuz out I started panicking, then I tried to my mama she's like I don't think you should go cuz look taking now is when you go over there is going to be worse for you and i'm like maybe it is right. And I told my brother who's like cuz like I, for some reason, like, I can make up my mind is like car for me like I can make a decision and I told my brother what should I do. And he's like Oh, maybe just don't go cuz you're struggling, if you like, well how many times are we taking the class you'd like laundry taken. The Viola need to fight for the second time taking rethinking anatomy for the third time he's like and how are you doing like i'm saying yes to have a 50 of both classes, you get me. That was last week and I started panicking like what do I do like you've had to wonder university, what I do like. i'm really know I don't know what to do, like a loss and then like cuz at school, they have like health care program that you deploy it to. Another like fascinating to me right, because I, at first, like my plan was to be like a bachelor's degree in bio. Right and even though, like I struggled so like that was like my plan right, but like I kept like struggling and struggling and i'm like Oh, I need a backup plan right, so my backup close to be like an ultrasound technician. Right so that's and I was like okay that's going to be my plan right so like for the ultrasound you like to take the prerequisites right and i'm struggling with that too. i'm like oh my God, what do I do like I was like so logged in like last week right and I was depressed I stayed in bed like for three days. And like cuz i'm like I don't know what to do, like i'm 25 i'm still like at a Community college and I don't know what to do. right that was last week and then this week I didn't know other exam yesterday and I study like I study right and I got a 44% and i'm like oh my God and they like to college, like the university. They keep calling me because I get, I guess, like the day like today, like I can't make up my mind. Like honestly cat."
705.0,Provider,"It sounds like to say lolly that you're also questioning if the direction you're headed in if maybe you've changed your mind, or you feel like something else might be a better fit and that you're still trying to see what that may be like."
6923.0,Patient,hey. Everybody expected me to be more like I am what I would. roll.
705.0,Provider,"yeah and what that to slowly is just because on test taking you don't exceed doesn't have anything to do with your intelligence. Sometimes test taking is just about memorizing or it's about knowing the answer that the teachers looking for which sometimes they use like it's it doesn't even align with what you learned. yeah. And i'm sure to slowly that when you have something like this happen that you do start to doubt like well well, can I do this, can I have, what is this something you like Why am I not getting this."
6923.0,Patient,"What is this trip going to be worth like I don't think it's worth it, because I feel like it years and, but like I."
705.0,Provider,"know. Well, you know, sometimes so Ali and water to figure out what we want to do is, we have to put ourselves out there and have the courage to do it. And then figure it out, sometimes, as we go along and that's what you're doing and and I think reevaluating if it's bringing you the stress and you feel like you've exhausted. let's say all efforts on that, then it could be a good time to re evaluate well okay is is this do I want to continue to do that and I just manage it through and see or is it where i'm going to take a break and reset and see what I want to do."
6923.0,Patient,Because i've never taken a break it's been like eight years semester like it's been like a couple of years straight. No play at all. yeah we had a break.
705.0,Provider,"yeah that's that's tough, so all I. Do you have to onsite have you talked to your school counselor."
6923.0,Patient,"And they'll consider like to talk to him, because it makes me feel like it was like I was struggling and she's like Oh, you should just drop out and that's all she said."
705.0,Provider,She didn't give you any alternatives that there's other programs that maybe you're a better match for. Okay.
6923.0,Patient,So that's why I don't know because I was the point of going to like account where they're going to make me feel like so.
705.0,Provider,Sometimes it's unfortunate if that was your experience.
6923.0,Patient,yeah that's like the second time they have happened so that's why like I avoid going to the account.
705.0,Provider,"Okay Oh, thank you for sharing that with me and it's unfortunate again. That they're not coming from a place of more understanding and that it's not just as simple as drop out that's it it's like well wait a minute what are my options here. i'm hearing what are your options that you're considering correct me if i'm wrong is to take a pause."
6923.0,Patient,Baby yeah. yeah.
705.0,Provider,And that people do it all the time.
6923.0,Patient,Like I feel. failure.
705.0,Provider,"One you know slowly with feeling like a failure because you pause sounds like that you don't give yourself like i'm having physically i'm throwing up my physical body is tired. And having to reconsider that at this time, for your health that you may want to consider a pause Does that mean that you're a failure because you're paying attention to your body."
6923.0,Patient,You.
705.0,Provider,"know, to me it doesn't sound like so ellie that physically, this is so draining and when I hear that you know, then you were depressed of what's going on, and you spent three days in bed because of how this kept going around and you're thinking about it. Sometimes you know you have that right. and not to discount like i'm glad that you're sharing that you feel like you know, a failure, because then you and I can talk about it and give a new way to look at it, because i'm hearing your physical body is telling you look so Ali, this is a lot for us, you know."
6923.0,Patient,yeah.
705.0,Provider,yeah.
6923.0,Patient,"keep doing it Emily what should I do believe me, I don't know what to do."
705.0,Provider,yeah. right if you feel forced to make that decision today does it have to be today.
6923.0,Patient,After one of the university yeah but like I don't want it like I don't want it.
705.0,Provider,"Okay, and that one's that one's easier right you don't want it so it's just like thank you, but no, thank you."
6923.0,Patient,yeah but they keep calling me awake.
705.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
6923.0,Patient,"yeah, I guess, like everybody expected me to like get like a. Like a kid like me."
705.0,Provider,"Not at all so Ali and that's where to that sometimes. People put on let's say a bachelor's degree, they put such a like expectation of that and self worth there when really it's not about the self worth you know that's tied to obtaining. The bachelors like you may feel good when you know if you get the degree, but there's other ways that are just as rewarding that you can do to. Maybe it's not a bachelor's degree, but it's getting yourself in a career that you feel purposeful that you have. A passion for."
6923.0,Patient,"yeah cuz I lost the passion for biology right because, like. A lab so the moral thing like I hate to do is I experimented quite miserable like I hated it when we think I like like the most part that's it very hated it."
705.0,Provider,"And that's you didn't know that until you got into the school and started doing those classes. yeah yeah you have a right so Ali to change your mind. yeah and you have a right also to everyone's else's they're like wishes for you and expectations is probably because of love and concern, and they want this for you, but that's their hope and dream. your help and dream may look different."
6923.0,Patient,I just want to be happy.
705.0,Provider,It is. Just wanting to be happy and feel like. you're a good match of where you are whether that's at work or if it's you know with your career path.
6923.0,Patient,will help I could be good at like that.
705.0,Provider,"In order to find out, though, that you even were considering healthcare, you had to go through biology first."
6923.0,Patient,yeah that's true.
705.0,Provider,yeah and a lot of people don't have that courage and so it's like can you take from that or hey I had the guts to give it a go. And then changes from being a failure to like wait a minute I tried it and I just don't match up.
6923.0,Patient,yeah that's true I did a baby like I wanted to bully. yeah.
705.0,Provider,"If you lost that passion, where you're in and you're saying you know what I didn't know that this was what biology was going to be about. Then, with that all this new information so Ali, then, can you give yourself permission if he feel like that's best for you at this time to. Take us."
6923.0,Patient,yeah. yeah if I guess of fashion to be like I know I wasn't giving me some free enough like tired of suffering like I physically can't take anymore.
705.0,Provider,"mm hmm yeah. it's not uncommon talalay that's why you have people that are going back to school when they're in their 30s and 40s and 50s and even 70s. because sometimes people believe that that stage of their life that they tried it they're going to take their time out go into a career and then maybe later on, take take courses of interest or to get their degree. You don't have to."
6923.0,Patient,Like force to get a bachelor's degree.
705.0,Provider,Who do you. Know force what's what's forcing you to get a bachelor's degree.
6923.0,Patient,"is like my parents, because my brother got work. Well, but now they change survive on the late like I struggled in your have to."
705.0,Provider,"Now, and you're not your brother and your brothers, you know and he's not you."
6923.0,Patient,Know like for something that always wanted to be my brother. yeah I don't know why I guess cuz he was like the oldest. And it was just me and him.
705.0,Provider,"It it's okay that you felt like you know what this was the pressure to do this, and now you're talking to your parents and they're seeing that hey maybe this is something to reconsider if you're having this much stress about it. mm hmm."
6923.0,Patient,You.
705.0,Provider,"Somali there's so many options out there to other career paths that you may not have to have a degree, if you don't want the degree, one where you just you go to like a certification school or you go. You know, you can pick a knock your occupation that doesn't require that same thing. yeah now in your life."
6923.0,Patient,What people see is like everybody a high schoolers expected me to get like like a degree blake. Who is he.
705.0,Provider,May I ask why that matters.
6923.0,Patient,I don't know cuz like every day cuz like a hey like everybody's like pressure i'll be for repairs for like friends. you'd be you'd like to create like a reality of you know.
705.0,Provider,"And that's where you know slowly is yes, they want you to do that and so your concern. yeah Am I hearing like you don't want to disappoint them because that's what they expected from you. yeah yeah. yeah to be fair, though, you could have expectations for them to."
6923.0,Patient,Never did. But what.
705.0,Provider,yeah but if we're. Living right you don't have expectations you're accepting them for where they are and who they are now. yeah and that's where putting that back out there with your friends have sent me for who I am and where I am now that maybe you wanted me to get this and you were trying to motivate me but i'm at the point where I need to change my course of action for my physical self. yeah and your mental health.
6923.0,Patient,"yeah I used to be fine, but like what's cool It makes me to present makes me extra that I wasn't even the answers anymore or depressed like like every city yeah once a semester starts is are struggling."
705.0,Provider,"yeah and it's like looking at other areas of your life too is sometimes you have to to look at it, and is it in balance or not, and if it's not anything that you feel is worth your time to continue to invest in is making adjustments. So if school is something that you're evaluating right now college is always going to be there. I mean if you decide 20 years later, and you want to go back, it would be there."
6923.0,Patient,"yeah that's true. The car because I guess do like like if I don't miss the bashing today i'd like removing like a cancer, I have like give my life right like it has this cancer for so long that like without they're like what do I do you know, like, I feel like it was like a burden, but now like. I guess, I know that i'm really like a reboot the daily like I had it for like was like 10 years what would I do without it, you know so i've ever know yeah."
705.0,Provider,"yeah and that's you know, I think that that's being honest so Ali that yeah. It will come with some changes. And then some adjustment like What do you do with your time, what do you do to focus on now because. A level of it to, even though it was cancer, a level of it, you felt good going to school because you thought that was the expectation."
6923.0,Patient,You know what.
705.0,Provider,Could you change the expectation.
6923.0,Patient,"yeah yeah cuz I can get to the health care program like that's very fascinating to be and there's like so many options. Now I feel like I can do that, like, I can do that."
705.0,Provider,yeah and their certification programs to that start off on different levels of the medical field.
6923.0,Patient,yeah that's what the school has.
705.0,Provider,"It comes down to you slowly and really taking like you know, sometimes that that. Inner look of okay what's going on let's talk about it and how do I think my best plan is for me at this time."
6923.0,Patient,"yeah cuz like I even talked to a Q amp a motive is like you need to do what's best for you and i'm late, I never liked to be honest, I never like thought of it like like what's best for me like I never like put myself first."
705.0,Provider,"And that's where if if people to that are being supportive, but they have their expectation you're feeling that pressure it's good to when you feel ready so Ali, because you don't owe them anything if you want to respond, you could. In the event, you could share with them that hey I know you wanted me to get my bachelor's i'm changing right now my focus and here's where I feel like today, I need to be. We weren't me."
6923.0,Patient,"Okay, that I own the company better no."
705.0,Provider,"No. And some may say, well, I got my bachelor's and it was great for me, it was an achievement and it's like that's great that's you in your path of life and so good for you. I on the other hand, is figuring this out and my path may change and i'm okay with that."
6923.0,Patient,yeah.
705.0,Provider,Just like your hopes and dreams that you had maybe an elementary are not the same hopes and dreams that probably you have today.
6923.0,Patient,No order to work at a chocolate factory.
705.0,Provider,that's awesome you know what that goes to show you that today that doesn't matter to you right.
6923.0,Patient,No even I would be nice.
705.0,Provider,I would eat all the chocolate.
6923.0,Patient,yeah.
705.0,Provider,"It comes to show you, though, that today so ellie that. No longer is working at the chocolate factory important to you that your hopes and dreams are different, for you today."
6923.0,Patient,"I guess like it's going to take like a few adjustments, because I yeah so i'll go to like the health care programs that's that's like totally different from what i've you know. scary to. Either either way like will be okay to say okay I go to the health care programs are still getting that education and forget so we'll get to that. Absolutely."
705.0,Provider,"Absolutely, and that is if this is where your passion has changed to go in that direction and along the way you'll reevaluate you have that right. And you know what if you feel like it's the where you need to be great good fit what a match if you feel like to that hey you know what i'm glad that I have this knowledge i'm going to go a different course you could even take a different course of that time in your life."
6923.0,Patient,"yeah. Either way, I can choose right."
705.0,Provider,"yeah. Things that you've learned in biology those things aren't going to go away. You you have that knowledge base now. So, even though, if you choose to let's say drop out you still have that knowledge that's not taken away from you, you just choose not to continue with that focus for your career."
6923.0,Patient,yeah.
705.0,Provider,And you were saying earlier to and hearing you when you say it is a lot of fear of the unknown and coming up with a different path is having the courage to switch gears and all that where it's like this is going to be something new and how will people react and how will I react.
6923.0,Patient,yeah that's like my concern now.
705.0,Provider,"How will you know, though, unless you do it."
6923.0,Patient,that's true and you try next.
705.0,Provider,"yeah and so you can decide, so all right now, of what your decision is based on how you feel and then go from there."
6923.0,Patient,that's true. But yeah. cuz I I cry like all last week is like this week to about it. And my mom was like an oil you're like she's like oh you're crying again like I could hope it was like this is like a major thing. I can decide like as we both know like I can't decide like for Thursday I can't make up my bike.
705.0,Provider,yeah. And it is. Emotionally exhausting to study study study pour your heart and soul and to try and to study for this test only to take the test and sometimes we've taken the test it's nothing that you're remembering from what you're.
6923.0,Patient,"Studying yeah and that's like like it, I take it to the heart, because I put so much effort is."
705.0,Provider,"And that's at the end of the day, what's important, so all it is you did try and that you're doing your best with what you have."
6923.0,Patient,"everyone's like Oh, why did you why did you should take this sooner and, like my I didn't know."
705.0,Provider,"You have no life experience like on on. Never in your life, where you needing to take a biology course because you didn't want to at that time and then you started along this path and. Like you said you've had some struggles."
6923.0,Patient,"Know like I get yeah it is it's hard because, like everybody. Now, like, I was like smart, but like even when I tell them like Oh, I feel my kids like what are you selling you fell and I like I take you like personally because I. I guess they have like high expert teaching me like I didn't meet those expectations and it makes me feel like a certain way, like like like i'm letting them down like like it's not my fault."
705.0,Provider,Right right but it's easy to go down that path where your self esteem next ahead and then you don't feel confident and then you go and take the test for the second time and your confidence level is already low. And then you even get lower. Like each time where it's just like okay I don't feel good about myself.
6923.0,Patient,"yeah that's that's like like sometimes like I don't even tell anybody that I have a test because they're like Oh, what did you get like no it's not gonna be good, especially something like oh you. got a 50% right. yeah are they doing pretty well 50 that's a lot for you and i'm like you know."
705.0,Provider,"yeah and what test to it's just like own what gauge, are you testing people if you take biology is so broad and then it's like well, what are we testing on and so. You know it's it's a number that they put out there you have to get this much to be you know, showing this is where the standard is. yeah it's like but are you considering that people learn different ways, are you considering that there's too much material for one test to be able to focus on this. And that we all different."
6923.0,Patient,"yeah. it's the wall cuz I. yeah I guess my. My my gut told me not to get the fascist state, because I know i'm going to suffer like physically i'm going to set for mentally i'm going to suffer and it's like it's not worth it, you know, like I more important than the degree, you know."
705.0,Provider,"Exactly slowly, you are more important than the degree, and you can also accept that with if that's your decision that it's okay to to fill some loss some sadness because. This is what for eight years you've been working on and to feel sadness that. I have the loss of that accepted and then be able to also like I see you get excited when you talk about the healthcare field. yeah."
6923.0,Patient,of knowing I can do that.
705.0,Provider,"Absolutely, and you won't know until you get in there. yeah."
6923.0,Patient,yeah.
705.0,Provider,"I think of it sometimes it's just like with love right if you've been hurt before and you want to retreat and not trust anyone, especially with your heart, the consequence of that is then you'll be alone, and if you're okay with being alone, then it's like okay. However, if it is it worth putting your heart back out there, that may be someone else's a better match. Is that better of risking that you may find someone than just retreating and having no one. So sometimes we have to take the courage to. put ourselves back out there."
6923.0,Patient,yeah that's what i'm going to do this.
705.0,Provider,"Just like when your heart gets you know, some people say my heart got stomped on yes, you can acknowledge your heart that stomped on and that you learn from that experience and when you're looking for your new person, you know of interest. That it's probably you're going to be looking for someone different or you're going to have different boundaries for yourself."
6923.0,Patient,"True. yeah I guess it is the law and my like the thing is like little I tell people like when they asked me Oh, did you get your bashing really, what do I know that I did."
705.0,Provider,"Well, and i'm hearing you say so Ali that you know what no i've changed my mind at this stage of my life that i'm not getting my bachelor's i'm looking in the medical field and i'm going to see what happens."
6923.0,Patient,"Because either way like like the plan was together bashing is great, but then go back to like the medical field, because I didn't need the voucher disease for those crazy."
705.0,Provider,"And so, right now, so Ali been with associates, do you have associates at this time."
6923.0,Patient,"Oh, if I pass the bio bio 185 yeah can get associate's degree."
705.0,Provider,"yeah and you know again it's just like Okay, how much is the degree, you know, like even with an associates that's hard to get to is it so hard, you know that you're going to spend more time in that direction, or like you said switch it and go in another field."
6923.0,Patient,"yeah cuz yes, I don't get this I think pricing is associate degree and yeah you're right that it was hard to get like it took me forever. Absolutely yeah yeah. And then get the credentials program at school."
705.0,Provider,avenue.
6923.0,Patient,"yeah and that feels like is, it would be enough for me."
705.0,Provider,yeah yeah like how many ways is there to make a peanut butter and jelly.
6923.0,Patient,"there's a lot of weight, no."
705.0,Provider,"yeah right, and some people might not even like the peanut butter and jelly so it's just like there's a lot of different ways to make yourself happy with your career. Rather it's an associates certification program some people go directly into their career, you know so there's different ways."
6923.0,Patient,"For me. or anybody, you know."
705.0,Provider,"i'm working with someone that he's older now and he's he has chosen for this stage of his life to return to the fast food filled because that's what he did when he was younger and felt comfortable and that's where he is today. And so, he was able to be like you know what i'm not going to have all this outside pressure i'm going to do this for right now why i'm figuring everything else out and he feels better. mm hmm. yeah. And so, for you so Ali, it may not be like you know going back or working fast food, but it's just that aspect of you get to choose where you are today. Do you feel like any of this, you know so so sometimes. We can have things in our life, and we can be depressed and and because of what's happening, and you feel the pressure. And then, sometimes it can be different than it's more of like a mental health disorder where you're feeling so depressed and exhausted you can't get out of bed that type of depression, do you feel like you have that slowly."
6923.0,Patient,Maybe not 90 more.
705.0,Provider,"Okay, so you know the difference because you felt the other one i'm talking about where you have energy and it's just like, no matter what you can't get out of it. Where i'm hearing, as this lately was just with school and you were struggling and the pressure was. Just too much."
6923.0,Patient,yeah okay. Okay.
705.0,Provider,"Okay that's what i'm checking on to. You know, we had talked about, and I saw the note to where they were sharing that you had missed a group, and then you shared with them your own monthly groups, and then I had wrote my piece, too, because you had on your care intensity you're still that monthly group. So I had to remind them."
6923.0,Patient,yeah.
705.0,Provider,Do you feel like that still supportive enough.
6923.0,Patient,yeah for right now yeah. Okay cool.
705.0,Provider,"Okay, so right now still keep it at the monthly because you have school and need the flexibility. But you go, you can come to more if you're available. yeah Okay, and then you and I meet twice a month and is that still at a good level."
6923.0,Patient,Can we do to me if if.
705.0,Provider,"If you would like to change it to once a week I can change it to once a week okay. yeah okay yeah let's let's do that, then so i'm going to change it to then. once a week."
6923.0,Patient,yeah cuz I feel like right now yeah like a huge thing.
705.0,Provider,"And i'm going to keep, then the monthly for right now we're going to put weekly here and then monthly."
6923.0,Patient,"yeah cuz I was the press, but I still does some stuff."
705.0,Provider,"mm hmm. The one thing to consider those if you are feeling more depressed in that you know meeting to spend more time with Mary than that would you know, maybe need to have a little bit more than the bottom of just one month. You know that's why I always ask people if you don't feel like you're going to be able to do it for the availability, then Okay, but if you do need to speak to marry a little bit more that's how it is and is to come to group and talk to her okay. yeah okay. So I am going to put them weekly. And let's then. Next time just looking at. Opening up your calendar to see. Is you and I are already have on 11 five at 1030. And then. We have. 11.

705.0,Provider,exactly right.
6923.0,Patient,If you haven't noticed like it's hard to like. Who admitted. But the truth.
705.0,Provider,"Is and it's coming from a place of understanding, like Okay, I get it family and friends wanted this for me they felt i'd be happy, but guess what I figured it out that for right now."
6923.0,Patient,it's not making me.
705.0,Provider,"And you have a choice to change, whichever way you want to go, you have the choice to stay in it and struggle and and get through it for you have a choice to be like Okay, you know i'm going to take you know, a change of direction."
6923.0,Patient,"yeah I think a sense of direction is better. At this point, yes, especially. Since I was like struggling, I had a work and, like, I saw like the coffee, I remember I mentioned it before. And like. Like I was like so I children stuff that I told him like hey I don't know, should I get my bachelor's degree, I told him, he was like. He was in Europe for that day he's like oh so you're on the right track, your and i'm like, why are. You, the girl, you are because you're like you're triggering now like, at least, you know you have an idea. And i'm like. yeah."
705.0,Provider,"Exactly and as a human, how do we know what direction we want to go in, because we have lots of options. And we may choose an option that we get in there and we do, and then we figure out that you know what like you're talking about your passion level isn't you don't really have a passion for it anymore. No yeah but you haven't lost what you've already learned. You probably will take this through your lifetime that when it comes to biology you're going to be someone that knows a lot more than maybe if the average person yeah."
6923.0,Patient,"yeah. I guess you. can put it in a way it looks like weird cuz I know he's like like creepy before I knew it, I thought he was like you know, like a Fred because I always thought it was wonderful we."
705.0,Provider,Have you had him come into the room is this the same restaurant guy. yeah yeah.
6923.0,Patient,"yeah he knows my schedule. You know, like he knows my schedule. yeah and like one day like i'm sorry that I didn't talk to him right. And I told my friend, I work too late, if something happens to me like. Like I need to tell everybody like I don't know that's just me like if something happens to me like I like a lot of people know like I can't keep it inside like I Karen It makes me like if I keep something in spite it like makes me sick. So I told her about it. Because like I trust her and she go like care should I go, you need to be careful right and i'm like yeah that's why I don't talk to him right. I didn't talk to him that Saturday, but like he saw me alone, and they be started talking to me, and he was talking about like Bob dylan he has like he told me about the CD and this, the one that I want right. Like all. Right, like, I know I shouldn't talk to him, like he, like pushes me like to talk to him, like he knows that he mentioned Bob dylan i'm going to talk about it, he knows it like I wanted to talk more about the album like I I did it like I like I just want to make."
705.0,Provider,yeah unless you've learned from your past experience and conversations with them that you just don't feel like that he's someone you want to have that close of a relationship that knows you that well.
6923.0,Patient,"yeah but he does, like, I noticed I keep pushing. yeah like on Saturday I saw like when I feel like I just say hi cuz like little should I do like he sees me I see him like. Okay."
705.0,Provider,"Sometimes people will try to invade your personal space, because we all have a different you know parameters. Personal space. He may try to overstep and invade that but, just as you are like he just engage you didn't carry on and talk to him anymore, but you were fewer hi you know i'm here on. Your order but that's it."
6923.0,Patient,"yeah but like yeah that's because I was like my plan, but then last week I talked and I was like oh I shouldn't be talking like I had to like let it out like I do like no like I couldn't keep it was going on with oil like I couldn't keep it as fun yeah."
705.0,Provider,"And you make that judgment so Ali and at that time, it sounds like he was supportive and so you love here and now. And then you want to go and have dinner with them you just engage in a conversation."
6923.0,Patient,"yeah that's true. yeah because I feel like weird about it. Because I know I shouldn't be talking but like I just had to let it out and then, when he mentioned Bob dylan I, like all right, I have. yeah."
705.0,Provider,"Exactly wow so so today, what do you think the rest of your day is gonna look like."
6923.0,Patient,Like I wonder where like I have an exam next week. And they're like they changed my schedule I work and not have to work today.
705.0,Provider,i'll cry.
6923.0,Patient,I don't like. My check.
705.0,Provider,"Or is it that you go and and if you weren't going to go anyway, and now you're working five more dollars is five more dollars So then, if you make $20 and you'll be."
6923.0,Patient,"Yes, yeah, I guess, but to me honestly like as a server like people like the other server the Gaelic a little bit competitive like one day like this much money and i'm like usually I don't make that much which doesn't work like left a little bit of hours. And and i'm late and they're like I guess like showing off how much money they made and then look at me, like all like to be honest, like the money is not important."
705.0,Provider,yeah.
6923.0,Patient,yeah to me it's not important like I i'm just doing it's like it's like Facebook like cool like CDs. yeah.
705.0,Provider,"yeah and you know to you don't have slowly that your self esteem hasn't built off of how much money you make. you're there to do a job and you don't base your self esteem off of it like you said money doesn't matter to you you're still going to be you you're doing a job, and if you can save for college or whatever you want to do, then so be it. yeah. And with studying for your test to because I know you're thinking like Oh, I have to pass, I have to pass is there, another an expectation that you can do that's a little bit more. For you right now, a little bit more soothing."
6923.0,Patient,I write in my journal.
705.0,Provider,"yeah you write in your Journal and could you. Have a mindset that i'm just going to try my best. Because you're pressuring it sounds like you're pressuring yourself that I got a pass I got a pass. And it has said, you measure anxiety words if you change it, and you say you know what i'm just going to try my best i'm going to study i'm going to try my best and we'll see what the outcome is."
6923.0,Patient,So yeah I do pressure.
705.0,Provider,So with this upcoming testers hey you're going to do the best the best that you can.
6923.0,Patient,yeah and the outcome is. What it's going to be right.
705.0,Provider,"yeah and with that i'll come, then you know again you have choices all along the way, and when you're ready, you know, to take a pause you could take a pause if you want to see it through the the see it through, and then you can can then take your next steps it's all up to you. because everyone else can have their opinion so Ali but they're not the ones taking the class are they. yeah tell them you go and sign up for biology, then, and let me know how."
6923.0,Patient,It is.
705.0,Provider,yeah.
6923.0,Patient,I feel a little bit better now.
705.0,Provider,Good.
6923.0,Patient,yeah it was like the like the stress and the big it was killing me like like it was a physically I couldn't do it like it was like super stressful.
705.0,Provider,"it's a relief, because when we feel like we have to do something and that were struggling we feel trapped. And when we get unstuck untracked we feel a relief because it's like oh I don't have to feel this way anymore."
6923.0,Patient,"No click one thing my parents told me like like I don't need to get like the bachelor degree, like, I felt like I was like getting rid of this cancer that I have. yeah and I am like, but I feel bad and they say I shouldn't feel bad because, like, I tried and tried. And I did try."
705.0,Provider,"Absolutely, and you know for yourself that you tried your best."
6923.0,Patient,"yeah eight years old, nine years yeah."
705.0,Provider,"And you have no control over who grades, the test over who makes the freakin test, you have no control over that. No, so all you can do is do your best with what you have."
6923.0,Patient,"yeah oh. yeah that's, all I can do. Even though, like sometimes like I tell myself like i'm going to try my best, and like even though, like the outcome, like yesterday it wasn't good. But it still kind of hurts because I told my everyone in my notebook on 170 and do good on my exam tomorrow air like I did it and I was like Am I lying to myself, like give my life to me. Because I didn't do good."
705.0,Provider,"Or was the expectation to way up there, that that you're saying you're going to do good and the expectation was way up there were maybe the expectation that's more reasonable for you right now is just to do your best. And then, if you do your best and whatever that score is that even if let's say it's lower than what you thought it would be as okay I disappointed that that's the great I may. But i'm going to accept it and learn from it and not allow it to take a hit to my self esteem to feel bad and where I question my intelligence."
6923.0,Patient,yeah cuz that's what I do like all the time. And I feel like it's not healthy like i'm getting older and like like I can't take it no.
705.0,Provider,"You want to feel good, and I know was sometimes is when we switch gears and we like feel empowered and it's like I have a choice to change, and I will then it's more exciting to take a look at maybe the healthcare field, because there's so many options and to get. excited about that."
6923.0,Patient,"yeah and the slate staple because I after I get like my certificate like I can it's going to be like easier for me to get a job. Like To be honest, like my brother he got assassinated and biology and like he's like struggle minutes for like four years and he's working at a car wash you know, like I don't want that to be me, you know. And like i'm not judging him like you know I don't want that, for me. And I mentioned it to you in the US ago priests religious people like failure, like to take like what do you want to do with your life like I don't want to like struggle. Like since i've struggled so much like I just want to have like a stable job like at the end of the day, I want stability, because I guess like. I never really had that because I kept like struggling struggling and they're like I had no ability, you know."
705.0,Provider,"yeah and learning about yourself through this process. And so, if you take a look that it hasn't been a failure, you put yourself out there and that each time you were resilient you pick yourself back up you took another test you engaged in the classes. And you know again like I said with biology, you probably know more than the average person, because you took the class, and so you know about it and it's just like. You know, not all of us are are at the master's degree and say social lot sociology or something like that we're not all at the Masters degree, maybe some people are at a different standard that meets them where they are."
6923.0,Patient,"yeah like like a wedding buddy in and that's like that's that's something like new for me. So that's why I keep saying it over again because I. I still can't blame anybody anything. Right and, like me, I thought I did, but I do."
705.0,Provider,"And now that you realize that because that's common so Ali because society wants you to feel like you know, sometimes then everybody else can tell you what to do when to do it. But when you realize and you're empowered by your own independence hold on a minute I get to I get to choose for myself, and you know again love and support usually with family and friends it's not meant intentionally be hurtful. Sometimes it can. And it's like standing your ground when you're like look i'm going to choose my own path. And I would hope that you would support me and choosing my own path, but However, if you do not that's Okay, too, people can sit back on the sidelines as you change gears."
6923.0,Patient,"yeah because at the end of the day, like that has a has me."
705.0,Provider,Absolutely.
6923.0,Patient,Oh it's like a lot of like like. it's like old news. yeah.
705.0,Provider,"it's starting to believe in yourself slowly, and the more that you navigate through life that you start to realize if you just have that moral compass back to yourself and your beliefs and your values and your priority. Then it's your decision."
6923.0,Patient,"yeah cuz like I always wanted to go to a health check, like since my brother didn't notice, I was like oh I can't do that. And then, like my prayers like all you have to do like we're brothers doing. yeah."
705.0,Provider,But your brother's personality is different his brain was different I. mean everything socially he's probably different than you.
6923.0,Patient,And that's okay.
705.0,Provider,"Absolutely it's okay and and the way that you engage with people so la I can see where healthcare, where you feel like that would be a good match for you."
6923.0,Patient,yeah that'd be great at it like I know i'm going to be good at it.
705.0,Provider,"yeah yeah. And that excitement and for right now, you don't have to figure out what even that's gonna be like you know there's a lot of options and you just start on some of the steps of it and check it out."
6923.0,Patient,yeah cuz I have a choice.
705.0,Provider,You think the rest of the day. Having this new like getting this new energy that you have a choice. Will this allow you to focus differently and be like okay this this is this is where i'm at today.
6923.0,Patient,"yeah. yeah cuz I okay i'm gonna like 30 like the best I can. Go to work. I knew, like the best I can. And I guess take it day by day."
705.0,Provider,"mm hmm absolutely. Taking it day by day and then slowly when you believe more and you get comfortable with it it's your path and you're creating. yeah then everyone else's opinion and their feedback it's like well, thank you for your feedback in your advice. However, this is where i'm going to go for right now, but thank you yeah."
6923.0,Patient,"yeah cuz like I don't let the same thing, like I don't need a lead myself, because I."
705.0,Provider,point. yeah.
6923.0,Patient,yeah cuz I feel like I need a give them like a huge explanation why i'm changing like my careers are like my path like I don't need to.
705.0,Provider,"know. Absolutely and that's a very good point that i'm glad you highlighted that so Ali, so if I come along and let's say that i'm a friend of yours and you haven't seen in a while, and I say so Ali so so I heard through the grapevine that you may not be doing biology."
6923.0,Patient,yeah.
705.0,Provider,"And then, what What would you respond to me."
6923.0,Patient,"Like again like a little like anxious to like you know, like, I feel, like, I have to give like he chooses position, but I go, so I can say, like, I was saying dollars you put 90 more cuz that's not what I want at this time."
705.0,Provider,wow. So you're doing what you want to do.
6923.0,Patient,"yeah and it's scary because I, to be honest, like i've never. done what I wanted to like never. Like my parents are like I guess like my influences. Like I never had like the toy."
705.0,Provider,But now you do and you've had these really hard conversations with your parents. And it seemed like they're in line with you.
6923.0,Patient,But yeah.
705.0,Provider,hey we're going to support you rather you get your bachelor's or not. We want you to feel comfortable. yeah and not to have to struggle. yeah and there's different degrees of struggle and you're going to find that out more there's some that maybe you like and you're like hey this motivates me and there's other where you're just like timeout. Let me revisit this.
6923.0,Patient,"yeah cuz like I wanted to, I thought for a while, but like they wouldn't like let me. know, though, we say like always keep going keep going, but I could anyone. I guess I finally realized like I I care like I physically can't."
705.0,Provider,"yeah yeah and so some of the highlights of what you've been sharing slowly is you know you highlighted that it is your choice and then also is that you don't owe anybody an explanation, if you want to share that's up to you, if not that's up to you. it's like take a deep breath and just like work the shoulders off."
6923.0,Patient,Like I feel like yeah. Better. Good yeah.
705.0,Provider,"And I appreciate salami that you are able to be open and honest. yeah and that you put it out there, where we could talk about it, and then you resolve how you want to be where you want to be. yeah sure."
6923.0,Patient,yeah because I feel like if I told the truth that means freedom. yeah.
705.0,Provider,"There you go, so I know you have have worked but i'm hoping, you have after this a moment just to meditate or just like you said set it free."
