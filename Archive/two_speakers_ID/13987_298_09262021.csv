13987.0,Patient,"Oh, so I have never done that."
298.0,Provider,"And that might be something that you could do also to help with. Just with depression and some thoughts that are going on, do you have any negative side effects like aca theses where you have this restlessness jittery legs."

298.0,Provider,"Okay well. that's it's very common on Ray large to have that restless feeling inside of you. Okay, and so i'm wondering if this is a side effect of the medicine and if I could just give you something and i'll talk to i'd say about this is. give you something to try to see if it comes to your body down the thing that I would like to talk with Isaiah about is the idea of giving you something for irritability and so that you're not things don't trigger you so easily."
13987.0,Patient,Because I get irritated very easily and very quick.
298.0,Provider,yeah oh i'm so sorry.
13987.0,Patient,"Yes, I do."
298.0,Provider,"That that is hard when you're living life that. it's, just like the needles kinda edginess so i'm making some notes on you Tommy. I feel confident to help you with just a side effect, just to see if you're having a side effect to. The re lar."
13987.0,Patient,i'll give you some what's called a.
298.0,Provider,"benzo tropiques. And you take it as. As you feel a restlessness take one of those if one doesn't cut it take to, and if it doesn't help them, we know that it's not a side effect of. start. To. hear it cannot do Jeff. Is there anything else going on in your life."
13987.0,Patient,"No just. Oh, my anxiety is very bad not so the thing about the anxiety is I sit here anxious for no reason. i'm like I have i'm not going nowhere nobody's coming over i'm just waiting to go to bed and i'm very anxious and it ain't to go to bed, though, is just my palm start sweating the bottom of my feet sweat and give anxieties very bad as well."
298.0,Provider,"Interesting so one of the side effects ah that can happen with. Ray large railcar is excessive sweating and the medicine that I am talking about. Helping you with this restless feeling, it would also help with the excessive sweating it would also help with if this ever happens to you restless leg I feeling like you get into bed, and then you start you know jerking for no reason."
13987.0,Patient,"Like you're talking about like far less restless leg syndrome. yeah yeah. I don't have that, but I hope I don't get it."
298.0,Provider,"And that's true we don't want you, but just so you know. it's the same medicine that helps with all those things. Okay we're looking at calming the nervous system down. And again if i'm going to write the prescription for two tablets but see if one tablet does the job. Two tabs and if it doesn't you know tell Isaiah. Yes, okay. I thought, maybe you had a question."
13987.0,Patient,"Oh, I was gonna say I hope we don't. So my palms are sweating right now and i'm anxious for no reason. So I was going to ask, are you like taking place for Isaiah."
298.0,Provider,"Which means out. So I say no, I just am filling in for Isaiah he has been off on doing some work. And him and I work closely together on each other's caseload. So that's. that's why you're getting me today. Having said that, I talked with Isaiah every day, and so we. We work closely together um. he's a pretty neat guy. How how. Are you using any stimulants."
13987.0,Patient,"stimulus is that now, yes, I am i'm on I am addicted to meth amphetamines."
298.0,Provider,"Okay, and about how much, are you using."
13987.0,Patient,"Oh no i'm. A I took one powerful about three days ago, but I use a lot, but the last time I used was about three days ago, what was three days ago and I took one puff."
