15655.0,Patient,"it's Okay, but i'm gonna keep taking it and yeah yeah yeah I do have a question so yeah How does that work cuz I remember, I was on suboxone years ago. And like it's just kind of confusing like because I used to there were days when I think my spots in the morning, later on, something what happened and I didn't know using and it wouldn't affect me really and um so yeah, why is it that it. um. yeah how what what changes like to discuss, like every bit of. stored up a math a noun have to get out of your fat is that or yeah. What yeah. What is the reason yeah."
298.0,Provider,"What is the reason that you could use i'm repeating the question the way I think i'm. hearing what is the reason that you think that you can use, you can relapse and still go back to suboxone is that what you're asking me."
15655.0,Patient,"Well, I like after I was on suboxone for a while before like I would there was times I use heroin and it didn't really like when I took my suboxone the next day I would be fine you want to go. yeah."
298.0,Provider,that's what I do you know the answer because I don't know the answer.
15655.0,Patient,"yeah. heroin is works, a little bit differently in your body, you know it's maybe not stored for as long. yeah I think that's that could be a unified know it just works differently in your body and it's in your in your system, a little bit longer. yeah yeah yeah it's just a question I was trying to figure out when it would completely stopped, but it's yeah."
298.0,Provider,"yeah so sorry, let me know how it next week goes. Okay, all right."
