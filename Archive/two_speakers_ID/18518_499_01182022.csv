18518.0,Patient,"And again, I apologize for missing that appointment."
499.0,Provider,"Oh no that's, that is, that is fine, because I actually thought that you were scheduling for every Thursday anyway, so I thought it was odd that you were on for that Tuesday, but it's all fine."
18518.0,Patient,"i'll be honest with you i'm overwhelmed. Okay, I have a lot of irons in the fire right now and i'm just trying to like advocate for my health it's almost a full time job at this point i'm fighting with the insurance company right now they're trying to tell me that the copay for my chemo is going to be 20 $500 a month. When my insurance hasn't changed."
499.0,Provider,"What Okay, so I thought you did have some sort of an insurance change or."
18518.0,Patient,"Well, they the prescription insurance move."
499.0,Provider,"Okay, but not not you're not your medical."
18518.0,Patient,correct my medicals.
499.0,Provider,"Exactly the same, so why are they saying there's a change in your copay."
18518.0,Patient,"That they they're saying that my prescription my medication is covered by their specialty pharmacy. Okay, so they're saying well we're actually covering like $4,000 so we're doing you a favor and I was like well I can't afford 20 $500 a month to. My medicine like I just can't afford to live if that's the way we're going to go with that, so I have been. A call back and I talked to a different lady who said that she could do it and I shouldn't have any problems but i'm getting mixed information and i've had five different calls with them and only one of them has told me that i'm Okay, and the rest of them have told me i'm not. I am very stressed, I am very stressed um, but I am trying to navigate it but supposedly the lady place the order for the medication it's supposed to be here tomorrow that'll be the telltale if it arrives and charged, so it is it's just a lot right now I am I am overwhelmed. And I am working on doing proper things for myself is. i'm overwhelmed but i'm in a better place than I was before, if that makes sense, like it isn't completely crippling now for the first week that I was on the full box, I mean."
499.0,Provider,i'm.
18518.0,Patient,"I didn't do anything. Okay, I didn't do anything um I mean like I still like did my computer work and stuff like I wasn't piddling or cleaning the House or doing anything like that I just sat. Okay couch or I slept I have been sleeping so much which I mean I already sleep a lot, because of the chemo and stuff but I mean like it's it's a lot I can't go without sleep i'm just tired all the time. Okay, so."
499.0,Provider,So you're getting about how much sleep.
18518.0,Patient,i'm getting between. Eight to 11 hours a night.
499.0,Provider,Any um how's your appetite.
18518.0,Patient,Less than normal. But i'm still eating i'm just not like you know i'm not grazing i'm eating like. Okay today.
499.0,Provider,yeah okay not not like a lot of extra snacking.
18518.0,Patient,Correct yeah. Which is actually probably a good thing. And i've been walking i've been taking daily walks. weekend my routine now so i'm doing a mile a day walking with my dog in the neighborhood.
499.0,Provider,how's the weather in national.
18518.0,Patient,"So it was a non event we didn't have anything, it was like. really good and just know how about you."
499.0,Provider,"So we're it's just like hidden is like literally I went to my mom's house in Mississippi i'm Saturday, and we came back Saturday. They got really cold, but of course they didn't get any snow we woke up Sunday morning with probably about four inches of snow. But I work at a hospital hour down the street, they got no snow and all so it was just kind of like hidden hidden miss and even at my mom's House like the CD that's 30 minutes from her they got a lot of snow."
18518.0,Patient,that's crazy isn't.
499.0,Provider,"It was just yeah it was just weird because, like when y'all got hit really bad the couple of weeks ago we got virtually nothing."
18518.0,Patient,that's while. My old hometown they got 10 inches.
499.0,Provider,"Oh, my gosh."
18518.0,Patient,It completely. You know what to do.
499.0,Provider,"And, like the further east Bay got hit pretty bad because a lot of that so people are still like having issues like with their power and their Internet and stuff so."
18518.0,Patient,that's why.
499.0,Provider,"All right, so how's how's your depression."
18518.0,Patient,"um it's actually a little bit better than the normal but, again, like I just finished my period, a few days ago, so like popping up you know what I mean, so the glass is half full right now. I am, I have a lot of my plate, and I am overwhelmed, but I am not. i'm not ready to like end it all, does that make sense okay."
499.0,Provider,Okay.
18518.0,Patient,I just need a plan. to conquer.
499.0,Provider,Even with everything going on your steel pushing through.
18518.0,Patient,"yeah i'm not hopeless right now, but I was last week so but I was also about to bleed so it's hard to know what that is."
499.0,Provider,So okay okay.
18518.0,Patient,We got it.
499.0,Provider,"is like, if you get your medication and they do charge you at that point what other steps or plans do you have what else can you do."
18518.0,Patient,"um well I did reach I put in a put something on my Facebook, because I was so upset I was just like mikey most 20 $500 a month I literally can't afford to survive right now. I don't know it today because i've just been you know vented I was just. upset and I was like I, this is a broken medical system like I this isn't fair I can't afford that you know what I mean like cancer. Yes, yes. um so then i'd had friends reach out and give me resources to different grants and stuff that I want to look into I did look at prudent rx, which is supposed to do copay assistance and my drug does not qualify. And then, one of my friends was like we'll set up a gofundme and I was like no no go fund me I don't need that. Because I mean at the end of the day, a gofundme isn't going to fix it. Because I dollars a month."
499.0,Provider,Is a massive massive.
18518.0,Patient,"Cash you know what I mean like I can't ask that, from the Community by any means, and I would never want to ask anything from the Community anyway. You know what I mean so like I mean grant and copay assistance programs will be the next step is Jay. Really strenuous to navigate that stuff."
499.0,Provider,Sometimes I often wonder if that's on purpose to.
18518.0,Patient,"I think, so too."
499.0,Provider,"Because it makes you frustrated and they know most people are just gonna. say I can't you know and just forget about it, you know I can't do this is too much you know. and, especially, making all those calls like you were in like even with your own insurance company and just getting the runaround most people will just get frustrated and be just like you know for good."
18518.0,Patient,"Everything is frustrating like this doctor beset everything my my my work from home accommodation with tmobile. doing the same thing they've been giving me the run around since August. trying to get this short term disability paperwork filled out i'm getting the runaround from my leaf tech, I get the right around from from everyone who I try to help accommodate my health or if i'm trying to do anything to manage my health. It is an uphill battle consistently, and it is so exhausting I mean there's no way that I can work this month and still do everything that i'm trying to do, I have appointments almost every single day. And I am not like a normal person I can't go and you know wake up early and do a bunch of appointments and then work an eight hour shift my body can't handle that. yeah and i'm i'm so overwhelmed I won't lie, I mean i'm trying to like I know that i'm doing the right things, and I know like i've got my plan in place, but I it's just so much, I mean honestly if I if money wasn't an issue I would probably hire someone to help me advocate for my health. It would make need to have the ability to have a somewhat normal life. Somewhat you know what sounds the pandemic. alive lot it's a lot right now."
499.0,Provider,i'm so how's your anxiety.
18518.0,Patient,"Actually, better. It gets a little weird late at night i'm after like I take my medication and it's weird interim before I lay down. I think probably I just need to take my medication and lay down a little like you know. Yes, finish my episode of what I was watching. Because it is that time of the night i'm like oh God the world it's. Coming, and then I go lay down and everything is. Okay, so but I mean like as far as like waking up in the morning. I don't have anxiety, but i'm also not as productive as I would like to be so I don't know if that's like a transitional thing or, if I can work around that but. Maybe that's the OCD treating itself, I don't know. You know because I am a pretty structured person so. I guess i'm becoming okay with there being a little bit of a mess, which is something I wasn't really okay well."
499.0,Provider,"um. Are you do you feel like you're getting less done than before yeah. It is your motive. Okay, go ahead."
18518.0,Patient,"Leo maintaining i'm so sorry I didn't mean to cut you off so maintaining but instead of me being like oh my God my kitchen has to be clean before I go to bed. um I can go to bed with a dirty kitchen and do some of the dishes and then like do some of the dishes later is that makes sense. Like i'm a i'm not completely non functioning i'm still functioning, but I am functioning in a bit of a mess is, which is something i'm getting used to. Okay, so yeah."
499.0,Provider,Does that bother you.
18518.0,Patient,"know. It should it doesn't the Meta I think that's the medicine. It was weird I had a point last week it was that had a really groggy day, where I just I slept. I slept so long, I didn't wake up, it was when we missed the appointment and. i'm so sorry about that, but like I will have like five hours after my alarm and I was like what is going on, like, I was just but I was tired my body was just beat. I made myself get out of bed, and I moved to living room and I sat down and then I fell asleep there and I couldn't stay awake there and I looked around, and it was just like I was surrounded by like dog toys and blankets and I was just like displeases a mess and I don't give a shit. It was weird you know what I mean I was like I feel like I should like this one. But it's not I don't care. If it was like a weird understanding in my head."
499.0,Provider,"yeah but I I guess what I want to kind of differentiate again is between is like at some point in time, did you clean up the area or DG or okay Okay, so it wasn't there I don't care and it's just going to keep piling on and piling on and piling on, and I still don't hear."
18518.0,Patient,"No, no, no, no, no, I still did it. Okay, I just like i'm not having to do it every single day i'm not. Okay, so my other therapists. misfield she told me that I needed to start like last week my my focus goal was to figure out the difference between a human being and a human doing. Okay um and I find out for myself that a human doing is a pillar is someone that has to tinker that has to constantly be moving and constantly having to work on their environment and that's an exhausting cycle to be in but a human being moves with purpose. And I feel like I am moving with purpose. Okay, does that make sense, like yes i'm Okay, with the mess, sometimes, but the message doesn't stay I just. I can, I can rest my brain and go Okay, I can handle that tomorrow."
499.0,Provider,"that's okay Okay, do you feel like you were more of a human pickler before."
18518.0,Patient,"Oh yeah absolutely. i'm i'm always moving always clean in i'm always organizing i'm always doing something like always got to move. And now I can like sit still, which is good, because I do need to be able to to work on things I just my anxiety, you know I had to be in control of something so if that meant a clean house or you know perfectly manicured plants that's that's what it was to me so yeah."
499.0,Provider,"Have they ever like. Has anybody ever said you like, or he narcoleptic Have you ever been."
18518.0,Patient,Not about narcolepsy or is it all pretty much just in it around you know.
499.0,Provider,Your immune system and being just compromised.
18518.0,Patient,"that's it. that's it girl before chemo you wouldn't even recognize. me I was on it like I would sleep like maybe five hours a night has always run and I was always doing like 37 different things, I was hiking I was doing backpacking trips, I was also working a full time job I had a pottery studio that I realized, I was. I was killing it girl, and then I got sick and now I am a Shell of my former person. I just am so tired all the time. But I mean I tried to fight through it, but it doesn't change the fact that, like my body just has to rest and then i'm even do that much you know what I mean like. i'm literally just doing stuff around the House and i'll get so tired, like, I have to have a catch up on the weekend, while asleep like 13 hours we joke we call it my hot 12. Lindsay got 12 because I want the body and they're like oh she's asleep like i'm literally asleep yes girl you'll ever meet and i've never been like that, before this medicine it's the medicine. So i'm just having to live and learn how to live life with that and it feels like loss and my therapist says it's like i'm grieving my previous life. Life yeah. yeah so that's kind of what i'm doing I guess it's tough."
499.0,Provider,"So you say you don't feel hopeless, so no thoughts, you know you say you don't feel like it at all, so you have not had any thoughts of wanting to to harm yourself or harm anyone else or."
18518.0,Patient,"Last week I did have the suicidal thoughts. Okay, it was right before my my period, just like we talked about before it's done that's the low debt that's the scary place. And that's what i'm trying to figure out, you know that's That was the main thing I wanted to address, but really I think I have two separate events you know it's my my day to day and then like that that dip in my cycle, but I went and got my bloodwork done with my Ob gyn. The day three of my cycle and then, I have a second panel of blood work on the 21st day of my cycle so and then she has been super communicative on everything and she's very familiar with my cancer. And just refreshing so like she's been really on i've had so many appointments with her this month as. Well, to get everything situated so well, no more when the day 21 cycle, and I think that that one is. February. February 1 is my day 21 bloodwork."
499.0,Provider,Every first.
18518.0,Patient,"Yes, ma'am okay."
499.0,Provider,"All right, um so in the past i've had I had some patients that only have depression or suicidal thoughts. When their cycle codes and then I have some people, you know they are depressed but it gets worse with your cycle. And so what has been doing for those patients and it works well for some patients is their medication is adjusted during that time so say you take 50 milligrams is all off normally, so the week prior and you seem like someone who knows, your cycles pretty regular."
18518.0,Patient,Within three or four days but yeah.
499.0,Provider,"So it doesn't work for someone, of course, it has an irregular cycles before a person that has you know, a cycle that they can almost kind of keep up with then. We increase their medication by about 50 milligrams um before their cycle comes and sometimes that helps a lot with you know that added depression that comes from that for a moment change during that time of the month, when your cycle was on. Okay, so that might be something that, especially when she gets that second panel of work that we might suggest you know, for you to kind of take you know your regular normal dosage but just take a little bit more, you know the week before you know that your cycle is start."
18518.0,Patient,"Okay, so that would be anything I can do to get relief. So, and I was telling misfields those just like it's I know it's not real. When it's happening does that make sense, like I have these the super intrusive thoughts, you know. I have like you know i'm just like I rationalize i'm like you know it costs me. Without insurance, you know this medications $10,000 a month and I can't survive without it, if I ever lose my job I can never be a financial burden like that to my family I just got in the yard and bleed out and I where there's no mess for anyone to clean up like I get like. dog. And then I have to. Say whoa whoa whoa like."
499.0,Provider,This is real years. But you have the ability to really yourself becky in.
18518.0,Patient,"Yes, but I don't know that I always will I mean that's what I was scary about it is like I make a super convincing argument as to why I shouldn't be here like I am actually more of like. i'm an expense i'm not I don't have a lot to to present does that make sense to you know to mean like, especially in comparison to where I was. it's like why Why am I even doing this like it's just fucking kill myself. it's awful it's awful to be like that you know um, but it does, and then I have to go in and I have to look at my thankfulness list, and I have to go hey like no. No, I stay alive for my sister I stay alive from my parents are still alive from my dog, you know, and I have that little list up in my bathroom and then, when I feel those feelings coming over me. I just tell myself, this is not real this is temporary, this is temporary it's going to go away and then I do self care and I take a nice long shower and I put myself to bed."
499.0,Provider,Do you have with your therapist that you see do you have a we all have a safety plan.
18518.0,Patient,Do I need one. mm hmm okay.
499.0,Provider,"You know just because you're. certain times of the month that you're you know, on a recurring basis that your thoughts do get that low and. The key point that you made to me today when I asked you were you able to real yourself out of that you said you know I can now but I don't know about always will be able to sell that's just a very you know. Key excellence."
18518.0,Patient,yeah and I guess I just me being honest.
499.0,Provider,With myself and I appreciate that i'm not a superhero like I wish that I was you know it's just like sometimes it is.
18518.0,Patient,"So heavy even even if i'm telling myself it's not real i'm just sitting there bawling my eyes out going it's not real it's not real it's going to go away and then like but that doesn't stop the argument you know what I mean like it doesn't stop the rationalization and. Sullivan. I was a dog, they want to put me down. we'll see you know what I mean no seriously it's different."
499.0,Provider,"And i'm going to send an email to them that you're a nurse that works with your oncologist don't know I want to know if it's contra indicated for you to take anything that would give you not like adderall or anything like that, but something that would give you a little more energy. So that you're not. sleeping all the time so that you're not, but I just want to make sure that it's not going to be compromised, you know with your own with your treatments issue don't truly have narcolepsy you know, but that. You have you know the qualities of a person to have narcolepsy if it will be contraindicated for you to take something that you know, like something that is given for narcolepsy that will give you a little bit more, you know sustained energy during the during the day okay."
18518.0,Patient,"Now it'd be really great it really would be so refreshing to have some sort of sense of normalcy back, like, I have one good week usually."
499.0,Provider,"A month, you know the whole month."
18518.0,Patient,"The whole month I have like one week and it's not always the full week sometimes it's just a handful of days, but I wake up and i'm Okay, and I feel normal I feel like a glimpse of my previous stuff and it's usually the week after my period. I sleep, just like the basic eight hours, I wake up i'm not tired. I can go out and work in the yard and do things on the property like I am Okay, and then it just been it's a slow descent from there. But i'll know that it's here when I wake up after eight hours and I actually feel well rested. Okay that's that's how I can tell when I wake up that like i'm going to be okay today. But today was not that day because I set my alarm for eight o'clock and then nine o'clock and then 10 o'clock."
499.0,Provider,And I just kept snooze and.
18518.0,Patient,I can't get out of bed I try I get up and walk around but i'm so tired I can't do any thing but lay back down it's so weird like I don't know how else to explain it like i'm not lazy i'm just exhausted and. I can't get up. It sucks so.
499.0,Provider,"Alright, so our plan for today is um I don't want to adjust the two medications that i'm prescribing. Because, of course, as we adjust them, you know it will have the possibility of still making you a little bit you know groggy so I don't want you to be any more groggy since you're not worsening you might not be 100% get I just want to hold steady here. Just for at least like um. I want to say two weeks. which will get us closer to that February 1 date, so we can kind of know if I want to if i'm just gonna work on tweaking your blue box, a little more if we're going to need to adjust that. zoloft around your cycle as well, and also, I would hope, I know people are very busy especially this time of year appointments you know, but the cove it and everything I would hope that maybe I can hear back from. Your oncologist nurse."
18518.0,Patient,With a yeah.
499.0,Provider,"For I see you next week, so I can have an answer on whether next week, I can implement something to give you a little bit more energy."
18518.0,Patient,"Okay, that would be great heather's usually really good about communicating so, but it is you're right, this time of year. yeah because everyone's at the beginning and trying to get prior authorization. Is cancer Center like my battle is not unique and you know what I mean like anyone who has what I have is going through this exact same thing at the beginning of every year. yeah she advocates for everyone she's incredible and. So."
499.0,Provider,"I know that's why I say you know i'm not gonna stick her to a day or two, but just hopefully by you know next Tuesday, you know I would have heard from her, and can you know implement something so you can get you know. be a little bit more productive and not feel as tired and down you don't think that would help, even with the depression so just you know, have a little bit of energy."
18518.0,Patient,"I love love. be really great. I just want to be just like feel like a normal human again that's, that is, the that's my end goal if I. could just you know. becky get the the the depression and the anxiety to be a little more like a smooth sailing and. Energy to do my day to day tasks without feeling. Like it's an obsessive. thing you know what I mean like before it was like I would piddle until like my entire body hurt like I was hit by a truck. But like stop moving."
499.0,Provider,Okay okay.
18518.0,Patient,"Okay, that makes sense."
499.0,Provider,It does yeah it does.
18518.0,Patient,"Yes, here now, I can rest, but now i'm like resting."
499.0,Provider,We gotta find that balance. We need to find that balance. i'm very thankful that's what we're working. towards finding that balance.
18518.0,Patient,"Yes, yes me."
499.0,Provider,"Okay, any other questions or concerns for me."
18518.0,Patient,"I know that I realized right before my appointment that I didn't do those two surveys, yet, so I will do those today, I promise. Okay soon as we get off the call okay. I guess My other question is that the short term disability paperwork. Yes, I do have to have that in by the 21st. um do you have any questions about that paperwork, or what you might need to fill it out."
499.0,Provider,"I won't have any questions, but I have to submit that over to the person that shirt care navigator and that person will let me know what parts they fill out and what parts that i'm going to need. To fill out and then i'll be able to let you know exactly you know, but I will get that done today, I have a patient right after you, and then I have about a 30 minute break, so I will discuss that with them during that 30 minute break, to see what all is needed okay."
18518.0,Patient,"Okay wonderful I really appreciate that I did hear back from heather on that, and she said that she's happy to fill out the pieces that are like routes that are regarding like the oncology treatment."
499.0,Provider,base.
18518.0,Patient,Article which leading the behavioral part because. This is a behavioral leave. I mean really it's a blend of both that's I don't have the energy to do both battles. bry. You know what I mean here I don't think you'd.
499.0,Provider,"Be in your best interest for both of us to. fill out, you know because, like you, don't like if you don't have any medical issues that of course is just site, if you don't have any like issues, and it will just be medical, but you have both, so I think it would just be better if we. didn't know if we both filled out, you know what was going on."
18518.0,Patient,"Absolutely and i'm so thankful for y'all and helping me with this, I really appreciate it, but like I said i'll be here, and if you need me for anything you can give me a call and I. get a clarification and then I can get you, I have my leave tech my specialist. Will."
499.0,Provider,Fire do you need that information give. Give me give me the information because the care navigator might need that.
18518.0,Patient,"Okay her name is. Sandra. I try to keep it all together in one place. and phone number. Well, I don't want to hold you up I don't see it here, but as soon as I find it out email it to you soon."
499.0,Provider,Okay okay mercy okay I don't want to hold you up and.
18518.0,Patient,I soon as I find it i'll send that over.
499.0,Provider,"Okay okay alrighty in i'll be looking for an email like I say soon as I get off with the person that is waiting on me now, I have a break from about 12 to 1230 So if you can email it to me by being that way I can get the information to the i'm care navigator okay."
