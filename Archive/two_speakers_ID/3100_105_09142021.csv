105.0,Provider,Nicole works. Hello. Okay.
3100.0,Patient,How are you.
105.0,Provider,"i'm doing great. just going to take a minute and start a note if there's anything you need to do get a charger loss of water tissue let people know that you're going to need some privacy for about 45 minutes. This would be good timing. um. I just read a little bit about what we talked about last one. Okay. there's a little bit of a sound, are you hearing it in the audio. you hear it."
3100.0,Patient,No okay.
105.0,Provider,Do me a favor log out and come right back there's a like a. Good song sound i'm hoping it'll just clear away just come right back i'll say right here.
3100.0,Patient,Okay okay.
105.0,Provider,Oh okay let's see how we do.
3100.0,Patient,"Or, though."
105.0,Provider,"yeah we'll keep an eye on it. Right. So um. hey. I do, I do we'll see I do want to. do some parts work with you, but before we do that, I want to check in on a goal that you had had set for yourself, which was, I want to be able to speak freely with my wife, want to make a little note on some of your goals today. and If you were to assess that are you feeling like you can speak freely to her."
3100.0,Patient,"um you know something that I have been practicing on. it's taking like a different approach towards things you know, like. being more settle instead of more okay everybody say your cell phone you're so outspoken you're so fun, you know and it's like a. Fight I just kind of feel like get my. I guess my communication skills are a little bit different you know, and so, especially like when. Like speaking to my kids are and in speaking to my boss for an example, you know are speaking to my wife and take it to my boss."
105.0,Provider,I guess.
3100.0,Patient,"They just kind of feel like that. i'm speaking to them like in a grudgingly way which i'm really not because they're like down you're so rude i'm like i'm not rude i'm just being honest, you know, an intro it's like. stop it, so what I had been doing is, I have been trying to. I guess the more soft spoken, I don't know if that's the right terminology there but."
105.0,Provider,"Well, why don't we you know I don't so let's do this, no, I often have the ability to label things where some people don't have a label, so why don't you do the. i'm heard as rude when I say this, but when I talk soft spoken like this, I get a different reaction, so let me hear rude let me hear soft spoken."
3100.0,Patient,"Alright, so. A prime example of this would be. My kids have been having some issues with some of their grade you know and, of course, you know I don't have an education, so I take it really seriously I take like because oh. Oh, I don't want my kids to fail and. So last night. I had asked my son, I said, do you have any homework. And he's like no I don't have any homework. I said, are you sure you don't have any homework and he's all night yeah sure. And then I said. Go get your bag, I want to look inside your backpack. And he's like Oh, I remember I got this and I was like. I was like. Why didn't you do tell me when I asked you if you had any homework, why did, why did you lie to me. and you're like I don't know I think yeah you do know. I said don't lie to me. Right. and So he got all kind of bent out of shape. And so. I was like until I was raising my voice to him, I was like I refuse to let you fail like I was being like. On that about it, and I was like yeah. And then. So we got the homework. And then I was like. Well now, I have on edge where he's not gonna want to do it was like."
105.0,Provider,"A stick with I got you, but I just want to hear it you're doing great now here, let me go over the other version."
3100.0,Patient,"So, then, I was like. stopped. I was like telling myself, you know, like maybe i'm just for, then I was like. I said looks on do you want to be a D student or do you want to be a soon. As I like I want to be a student that I was like okay. I see, so this is what it's going to take me to be an a student okay hard work and termination."
105.0,Provider,A student.
3100.0,Patient,"And so after I had well, I want to be honest, I was, I was really pissed because he lied to me first, so I was like on his ass about it and then. And I just realized, you know I did the same crap and I was a kid so, but my dad didn't sit there and tell me Oh, do you want to be a better student or do you want to be there, it was you're going to be a piece of shit you and I wouldn't be nothing in life. As a failure and I didn't I didn't want to you know tack that on to him, I was just more like. I want you to be an a student, I know you can be an AC and he goes i'm dumb right. Oh, I was like you're not dumb he's like i'm stupid and so you're not stupid, you want to thank you, you know you know I tried to when they try to tell me stuff like that. On Dom and i'm just stupid, I can know you're not dumb or stupid you just want to thank you right, you have to change the way you think. and Go oh that's kind of like a an example, I can use because. i'm really fun with them. And then i'm just like Maybe I should change it up, and you know come down to their level so that they can understand where i'm coming from and maybe they can have a different approach towards it to you know so, for me it works. and that's where i'm at with it just now, so I don't know if that helps or but I noticed that when I calm down and. I want to be honest, sometimes I take myself out of situation for a minute or two."
105.0,Provider,yeah.
3100.0,Patient,And they come back to it and be like look. This is why i'm so hard on you.
105.0,Provider,mm hmm.
3100.0,Patient,"This is why it's important for you in there and then they gave me this crap i'm just a kid. I get it. I said, but if you don't start now you're not going to form good habits and I said, if you just want to go duck if you just want to just play around and and and I take it, serious, what are you going to do when you get to high school. What are your habits, going to be in high school. And I kind of help and I kind of and they kind of see where i'm coming from. And for me it's kind of good, because you know I didn't get that you know I all I got was. You know here's the week, can you sell this for me is your school, you know."
105.0,Provider,"So is it true that when you're talking with your son you say things like. That big reaction my yelling that that part's coming from me, I didn't have a father that sat me down, and let me know. How important education was. And held me accountable. And didn't call me out on the line, do you share that personal part."
3100.0,Patient,"yeah not to that extent, but i'm just like like you have me as myself, as the example i'm like. cuz you know I worked for a restaurant and I worked for 20 years and i'm like do you want to work, the two drugs for the rest of your life like me they're like no dad no I don't want to do that."
105.0,Provider,Okay.
3100.0,Patient,"I said, well, we don't have an education. And you don't work hard, these are the things that are just going to happen. You know I already have I have. I have you know, two sons that you know that work with me. And it's like and, of course, my daughter was with me, but you know she's in she's going to graduate this year so thankful for her you know she's doing she's working hard to graduate but. And it for me it's like. it's hard because. You know i'm raising my kids up and I home and also in a work environment, you know, and I, and I tried to separate you know separate it, you know but. there's like it's like a life lesson in both of them, you know. You know if you don't don't go to school, if you don't work hard, if you don't get an education, this is what you're going to do this is going to work for minimum wage. And it sucks you know because i'm working from paycheck to paycheck. And it's just like shut up and i'm not saying that i'm not making it. I just i'm not where i'm not at where I want to be, or where I should be. So yeah for me it's just like so I give them that example all the time, like if you don't work hard, this is why even into you know and so. that's what I do and I don't know if it's the wrong thing to do the right thing to do, I don't know, but I just feel like like if I use myself as an example. They see how hard, I have to work they see my struggle, every day, and so, and I bring that to life to them, you know my. Everyday I bring it to life to them like if you don't work hard in school, if you don't you know practice you read it you're never going to get if you don't practice your multiplication you're never going to get it. and My son likes to play on the playstation four he likes to play fortnight whatever i'm sure all the kids like to play fortnight, you know and i'm like how did you become so good at playing fortnight. Is all practice that I practice I practice. that's right, how do you expect to become a good reader if you don't practice. You know, and I said, am I right Am I wrong. And that's my that's my phrase to do, am I right or am I alone, you know you tell me what you think, am I right Am I wrong oh you're right you're right, you know and i'm like Okay, so if i'm right. There why don't we put in more interest you know. And it's like well I go to school, all day like I understand that, but it doesn't mean that you can't do a little extra at home, to make sure you get good grades. I sometimes have taken and sometimes they don't but. it's a constant battle right, because every day it's like they forget and so today when I when I get off work, you know, maybe like. where's your homework, where is it oh I forgot, and sometimes I get upset with them and and but sometimes it's just like it's a developing you know it's a development so."
105.0,Provider,"I want to back up a little bit to communicating with your wife just for a minute. You gave an example and it's not to minimize that example I took a lot of notes, actually, but I want to talk about specifically feeling free to talk to your wife, this is your goal wasn't how do I discipline my children, which we can certainly create some how are you feeling. In your sense of freedom to communicate with her."
3100.0,Patient,"Since the last time we had spoken a little bit better. i'm like. You know, for me, it's like. I guess, I guess, I guess, like a and I using an excuse me, because. Because i'm not kind of be that and I kind of be that person, you know because. In my household whenever I was a kid. I saw I saw a lot of abuse, a lot of neglect. and And you know so. My mom really didn't have a whole lot of, say, you know she was told she wasn't she was told and. It sometimes I kind of see that. And our relationship and it's like. You know I don't want to tell my wife or. You know, make or make my wife, you know, but then you know my wife is such a strong woman, you know she's like you know it's tough because we collide a lot and. And, and after after we come down. You know. Then we then we're able to to speak freely to each other about how we feel about things, or how we don't feel about things. And it's like you know i'll work on that. You work on there and it's got like here lately it's been going back and forth, you know i'm like okay well. Maybe I can change the way I speak, and you can change the way you add or I can change the way I act, and you can change the way you speak, you know and. it's just I just think it's getting better it's hard to explain how but. it's just being better I think and it's working."
105.0,Provider,I do think it's important to know how you're doing it.
3100.0,Patient,"Okay. I don't. I don't I don't know. I guess i'm just i'm just not so like. I guess I just like ease my way into thing you know, instead of. Instead of like. I don't run a Bush a little bit until we get there."
105.0,Provider,"No, I don't I don't. I don't know I don't know beating around the bush and I don't know easing my way those are phrases that you could talk about. A Bush she's a woman don't you know it, believe it or not, you know, in your head, but if you were to put that in writing and teach someone watch you're going to teach your son. What beating around the bush looks like verbally. And you're going to teach your son, not to beat around the bush verbally. What would you teach them."
3100.0,Patient,Because like oh.
105.0,Provider,"that's why we're in this moment, right now, because you're using metaphors and they they're not effective and being able to say this is how I did it and I can go do it again."
3100.0,Patient,Okay well that sounds that's what i'm saying don't man.
105.0,Provider,"yeah but beat around the bush, if a child said. I don't know what that metaphor means what. How would you operationalize it, how would you say i'm sitting here talking to mom and before I would beat around the bush, and I would do and say this, and now I don't beat around the bush, I do and say this."
3100.0,Patient,"well. Like. Even myself like. it's hard whenever you get put in check this hard. And sometimes sometimes whenever. I get called out of my shit. You know I take it in I take it in like. Sometimes we take getting called out on a shit talking shit right. And so I try, I tried to a different approach, where it's like. yeah I bring up the subject but i'm like that so deep into the subject until it until it's accepted until it to invite it in like oh yeah we can talk about that yeah, how do you feel about that and. Like."
105.0,Provider,"How do you feel about that, who is speaking right there."
3100.0,Patient,Right so.
105.0,Provider,"say I asked my wife, how do you feel about that. yeah Is that true I asked my wife, how do you feel about that."
3100.0,Patient,yeah well and I do. I don't know you confuse me.
105.0,Provider,"I know so stop to this so here's part of it language when when we have when you have a style of one person does this it gets very confusing just stick with I it will get clean and clear very quickly so go just tell the truth, no storytelling you know what when. I asked my wife now, how do you feel about that ask yourself i'm Daniel is that a true statement is that true. I asked my wife yeah I asked my wife, in fact, I remember, I asked my wife last week, how do you feel about that is that true. Very simple black and white, yes, no true not true yeah yeah fantastic were you doing that, a year ago. Okay, if you were teaching your son what give me a phrase for the opposite of beat around the bush what's the opposite of beat around the bush."
3100.0,Patient,Telling the truth.
105.0,Provider,"There we go i'm cheap if you're teaching your son, how to tell the truth and communication hey son one example, might be asked the person, how do you feel about that. truth. So in mind, I might say um. I asked questions. That that might be a way, I would say it. truth. How do you feel about that that's a question right it's a question, so I. have direct communication by asking direct questions about how they feel about something. Now I don't know if that's true. We gotta go really slow. Then those we're going to back all the way up so now we've said a couple of things and let's just see what's going on here. How Daniel do you. communicate with your wife differently so that you feel more free, how do you do it."
3100.0,Patient,"well. I have learned is this little approach that. That we're always offended right, and this is how, and this is what this is what made it made it work for me. Because I tell her I said, why are you offended I said i'm not trying to offend you. I tried to talk to you right. And I said you're always looking for decent and I said and I don't need you looking for different I need you to communicate with me, I need you to talk to me. Okay, and. And I she said because, like I can't remember what we're doing what we're talking about. And she's like oh yeah that's what you have to hold on stop I said i'm not offended you don't look for an offense. Again, just talking to you. Okay, oh. It was about doing the laundry example. I said. I said, why did you do the laundry I was going to come back and put it up, I would have done it. And she's like Oh, I was just trying to help you out right and I was like. damn what did I say I said. I said Okay, thank you, I appreciate that. I can't remember what I said I said something. and She was like oh yeah don't act like I don't ever help. I said i'm not saying that like I didn't say that I said, why are you looking like I offended you for because I didn't say that I just just I was just more like appreciative that you that you did it."
105.0,Provider,"So stay there, stay there. Just gonna talk about laundry that's all we're going to do right now we're not going to get into parts work this this so stay there, right here content is laundry. The how you talk about it notice how complicated and how much confusion happened with your wife your intentions were what to show what."
3100.0,Patient,appreciation.
105.0,Provider,"Okay stay there. Do you know that you asked her why did you do the laundry do you know you asked for that so watch your watch. we're going to step back from laundry for two seconds I just want you to notice catch the very first thing that happens to you when I asked you a question Okay, Daniel here we go why. What just happened. try and catch it fast, did you feel appreciated. No, no, little tip. spend a whole year. never asked by. Kenyan imagine, but it can be done, I have done it myself and something magical happens. Why question will automatically cause someone to be defensive. yeah."
3100.0,Patient,And I thought about that that's pretty good.
105.0,Provider,So watch now notice how you feel when I say. i'm role playing sweetheart I appreciate. The matter what I say you already like whoo don't you want to hear what I have to say.
3100.0,Patient,Right.
105.0,Provider,Are you feeling defensive.
3100.0,Patient,No.
105.0,Provider,"So why you do the laundry. drop it your children, why didn't you tell the truth. doesn't matter how old, we are, we know the next thing i'm going to have to do is explain myself justify my behavior i'm gonna be on the D. everybody's like that right."
3100.0,Patient,Right.
105.0,Provider,"You may not like it. But it's real so I don't say why I asked how. I asked people how questions I asked them do they know how they do what they do I don't ask them why. I don't want anyone to feel defensive, certainly not in here right, and so we take this relationship here and we so we feel safe here I want people to feel safe. In my personal life too So what is it that happens. drop why. you're looking at your wife and you share how you feel sweetheart I appreciate you doing that I was going to do it, and now I don't have to, and I just so appreciate you. she's going to feel appreciated now. After years of a particular behavior pattern. Where she's on the Defense you're on the Defense. we're going to be living this relationship that doesn't actually exist in real time it's our imagination. She may still respond with what I don't help you normally you really appreciate it today, anyone can respond defensively if they want to Okay, we can't control the outcome. But no matter what you shared how you feel with your wife, I really appreciate when you do that, and you come up behind me and do something sweet that's so sweet Thank you. Because what you can do if she says what she used to say, with a why question she doesn't change her behavior she says what I don't help you I don't ever help you. that's not your problem, Daniel. that she can't take the compliment she's still living in this other reality this other pseudo relationship, but you can say sweetheart you do a lot for me, and this is one of the many times I just appreciate you. You don't listen closely don't have to address this. You don't have to interpret what I would call a passive aggressive comment you opt out, which means you don't. Get hooked by that little fish what I don't help you ever like i'm lazy ass bitch yeah people. But but. yeah people can say whatever they're going to say."
3100.0,Patient,Right.
105.0,Provider,"You knew walking in feeling grateful someone doesn't take the compliment you have a choice. You can now be offended can't you well, should I giving you a compliment anymore, you can take one you get to decide whether you want to be offended. Or you remember, I walked in this room to give a compliment i'm gonna stay right there i'm gonna keep giving it the fact that she can't take it in is probably a symptom of years of you to having an effective communication don't overanalyze it and she has. She had a hard time in life i'm sure to both of you have had an easy time of it so you've got some communication challenges, very few people teach proper communication when you're growing up. But you stick with why you came in the conversation why you walk in the room to say something nice you stay right there. don't take the bait to get offended the same way you hope she does not get offended you are responsible for yourself. Always all we did was take one, and I could I could spend the rest of this hour talking about one little thing you did, which was basically trying to communicate gratitude and it turned into come some kind of nonsense. And then you start talking about why can't you take what i'm saying why you interpret this it can go off the rails immediately. Immediately immediately. And then, an hour later we're like i'm just trying to give you a compliment. This happen."
3100.0,Patient,"Later on, no."
105.0,Provider,Danger hours later. Two hours later.
3100.0,Patient,yeah.
105.0,Provider,"So. It is not a small thing to communicate it is hard. don't minimize it. So when I came in today, and I said how. How, and you are getting oh I don't beat around the bush. Well, you do actually. You do. And we do it, we all do it because it's safe behind the bush. To not say. And i'm starting to get defensive because you're not taking my compliment. Listen to that. Just imagine you have access to that kind of direct communication. What if that's true. Oh man, I really wanted you to to feel appreciated sweetheart. Now i'm frustrated I don't know what to do. say there. notice it I I talking about my experience not damn girl you sort of what you probably know, work on that uh. nope. I. I feel. Oh, I feel disappointed, I wanted to tell you how much I appreciate you and doesn't look like it landed the way I wanted it to look at how different, that is, I I feel i'm taking ownership I stick this finger out like this, you got an issue at all that you can't even tear a compliment. That person your point now it's gonna feel defensive same as a why question. I feel I feel I feel. An emotion not like and not that you will be into storytelling when you defend to. feel like you're beating around the bush woman. Your own therapist doesn't know what that means you think someone else is going to know what that means. And i'm being sarcastic i'm glad you laughing but my point is stop telling stories you want to be honest. You want people to tell you how they feel you're going to have to figure out how you're feeling in the moment yourself and it ain't easy."
3100.0,Patient,Think about it.
105.0,Provider,"or just do you even know how you felt when she wouldn't take the compliment, I mean it is complicated. But maybe it was frustrated, sometimes we work our way from really general words like frustrated confused. shocked surprised. We just say the truth, maybe that's all we knows i'm surprised I was. Trying to give you a compliment. wasn't the reaction, I was expecting sweetheart. And then you shut up right, then you shut up and then they get to go oh that sounded really different he didn't come at me with blaming labeling lecturing storytelling talked about his truth and you let this other person. care. Let this other person care. Does wife care that you are shocked confused and frustrated. It changes the relationship tremendously when you start changing the way you talk."
3100.0,Patient,I agree with that.
105.0,Provider,"With your child, so I said we would just talk about laundry if you don't mind let's talk about your child for just a moment, if you had come in and said. I feel sad and scared. That you're hiding stuff from me reminds me reminds me of my childhood. Or you might be doing this thing kiddo will you just lie to avoid. Getting in trouble everybody does that so i'm pulling out the homework and i'm looking at it, because I know that's just the way kids are i'm not mad at you for that and that's what kids do, but I want you to know. i'm more concerned that you don't believe in yourself, it reminds me of how I didn't believe in myself. It makes me sad i'm going to push you hard, no one pushed me I believe in you son, no one believed in me i'm going to believe in you, I do I see you I hear you say i'm dumb i'm stupid that's how I used to talk to myself that's not true. You are smart. And you may forget but i'm here to remind you let's let's do this together, how can we. versus why you lie to me. The fact that you're responding to the lying nobody likes to be lied to, but it is not just because you are disrespected and again you have a choice to be offended or not, because you are. You have a choice you see this as a teaching opportunity with him to let him know I believe in you sweetie you don't. eat probably doing the avoid and getting in trouble, and you don't want to be accountable get your homework done and sick and tired and doing schoolwork I get it. But let's do the hard stuff and let's be honest with each other i'm getting triggered because it's reminding me and my own childhood so let's cut the lion let's get to it, you see the difference it's, it is the kind of raw honesty. And truth telling that doesn't require yelling doesn't require it. Because to see an honest vulnerable man, and you know what this kid gets to do be honest and vulnerable than yeah like I straight don't even know how to do this work I didn't know how to ask the question in class now maybe he can feel safe telling you and you can go. me too me too, this is what I do now, this is what you can do an attorney did it and now you've got this honest sweet conversation with your son."
3100.0,Patient,"yeah because you know. Like We said that because you know. We did that for 10 minutes about. Why did you like for 10 minutes and instead of you know, instead of it being like all right, I get it, you know let's just move forward. And so, and then now at the end of the 10 minutes i'm frustrated because he lied to me he's he's upset because i'm yelling at him for like for him lying to me and then exactly right because that's where we ended up that and but you know. and his homework it's taken us 30 minutes instead of 10 minutes you know and it's because of the you know back and forth, you know I guess that you know and that's something that I really do need to work on, because. I feel like, if I can improve myself and and those areas and just those little areas, you know they can have more confidence of coming to me, instead of avoiding me in and that's something that I want you know so. it's important for me for my kids to have confidence that they can come to me, instead of them, you know, fearing to come to me because I used to be like that you know and with my dad you know oh my gosh I was like these just don't get it, you know but. You know I don't want my kids to fear that you know I want to be able to come to me like that I need help, I don't understand. What you know Whatever the case may be, you know when their homework, or just anything in general, you know I want to be able to."
105.0,Provider,"But they're not coming to stay here with the line because a lot of people get them a you you're resonating with offended so i'm going to keep using that that's wonderful that you have access to this self awareness, a lot of people get themselves offended when we are lied to. But that is not about you that's about this kid i'm hedging his bets he's like is this complicated maybe I don't feel confident about the work on board i'm tired of it or. You know I didn't do my homework and i'm very simply trying to avoid getting in trouble, but that's about his decision making and any of us have done that, when we were kids we've we've all done something like that. Okay, and so we have we're just sweet and kind and we made it we say you know hey man, I was at one of these things I get it done the same thing, but that's gonna that's going to get in the way. it's a bit of an inconvenience my having to go look through your bag so over time son. If you stop doing the line I won't go in your bag now i'll trust your word, so what would that be like, if I stopped scrounging around in your bag. Now, over time, maybe next month, I will trust your word and I won't go look when that'd be nice, would you like them like that son would that be nice, would you like me to. not have to. double check yeah and you probably say yeah I want to be trusted I say okay that's how we get here, then you know what own up to your ship because i'm going to eventually find out the truth, anyway, you might as well just tell me. You know, just like I didn't do it, I didn't do it, I didn't do their own work i'm gonna find out anyway, so you know, so you might as well. might as well, tell me let's let's you know our relationship is more important than one homework assignment let's be honest with each other, we all get tired y'all get bored y'all get lazy yo own it."
3100.0,Patient,Right.
105.0,Provider,"Okay, it gives this kid and out that it is normal to feel I don't know what they are overwhelmed with a teacher that's a bully. calls a student they're bad teachers out there, they call them stupid, I mean it is bad, sometimes in schools Okay, it is rough. And we don't know what they're going through they've gotta be able to come to us and we have we say it sometimes yeah some teachers, they got no patients do you have one like that. You know, do you feel like you can ask your teacher questions and you might end up finding out. In verses why why why we we ask and if they're called informed questions where they kind of already have the answer inside of it. yeah do you can sometimes have a hard time asking your teacher to clarify some of the math questions and they might say yeah because we already have the answer in our question sometimes i'm like oh no and it. I just i'm and i'm so tired today Okay, well then let's take an extra an extra 20 minutes and not do homework for a while yeah don't you get tired, how much do you want to come home from work and review math for your ged. You don't right i'm oh i'm done Okay, you can relate to that it's so many hours of class work. So we take an extra break and how human and sweet, that is, go okay go. Go play a little bit and we'll come back I get you. Is this a lot of work. But be honest right look what you just did by talking like that now he gets to say I do have homework with dad i'm my brain is fried I just need a half hour break, would you rather hear him say that."
3100.0,Patient,Right yeah.
105.0,Provider,"So you create the safe environment for him to do it. it's not a bad boy it's you know. Right now. So. Originally, I was going to do some parts work with you, but I think that's just stay here with what we started, which has to do with this this notion of. Communication and how you can use skills to communicate when your initial response might be that you're offended. To give me another example let's role play one more communication or maybe you could ask me questions if maybe I said something, and you want to go over it again."
3100.0,Patient,"No oh. God i'd really like to. know because. I guess, I guess, just like having. Like good like parenting skills, you know I tried I. You know I try to develop these parenting skills, you know as I go, you know cuz I don't know if i'm a good dad and I, you know. I mean I my wife always tells me you're a good dad you know you're always you know I think yeah I know I know I provide for my kids I know I try to listen to them, you know. So for me it's just like. That. Everybody just so offended right because we because."
105.0,Provider,"will go with you and i'll tell you why because we can't do a darn thing about what they do. Tell me, we must defend it."
3100.0,Patient,"Well, for me, for me, it's like I think I just think I just think i've been program to always be a fan. growing up, you know they don't and I know i've got my own mind you know I got my own my own person, but whenever program at. The way has been programmed to me like I did."
105.0,Provider,You know what the programming was.
3100.0,Patient,Always i've always.
105.0,Provider,Do you know what the programming was. it's that you're to blame. Programming was it's your damn fault boy. it's your fault that this is broken it's your damn fault that i'm an angry violent man.
3100.0,Patient,"yeah basically you know. It was always you know because. it's just me and my brother, you know and. You know, I was that kid my brother was a biological kid you know, in it, I was the oldest I knew better I I you you you you you."
105.0,Provider,"So, Daniel that needs to change. has to do with your automatic shame activation that happens. But you're not alone you've got two people your wife to has cultivated probably and I haven't met her, but, most people they get shamed activated and they're nowhere near aware of that emotion that's unconscious, but what we all see is anger. you've cultivated y'all have cultivated this protective Armor of will screw you, Lady. You shut up why don't you work it out, but underneath here underneath here. i'm feeling unworthy stupid flawed broken. And ashamed like I did something wrong, and I cannot I can't say it i'm barely conscious of it, but what I show people is anger. everybody's doing that your wife's doing that to you know what's underneath here underneath all of her anger same as you. she's got the same stuff the only gooey stuff, you have the sense of. I don't I don't do enough I don't I don't clean laundry. Do you know what comes from her own sense of shame i'm not enough. We all have that inside she has it to underneath all that crusty exterior is probably a shame activated men, just like you. But it runs unconsciously. And so what psychotherapy does what this moment I hope and i'll do this hundred thousand more times is encourage you all to stop. Take a second and think how am I feeling Okay, if I know anger is a secondary emotion and it's to protect me. from harm from anyone pointing out that I did anything wrong because i've already blame myself or you feel like an idiot. Okay, so hold on a second, how do I, if I if this therapist were here, and she was saying what's your emotion you're feeling right now, if it's not anger what's underneath it. I feel dumb I feel. Flawed broken. Small helpless sad scared you figure out what those are. You won't need to be offended by what someone else's saying you really sort of be like you know what I know what i'm bringing to this interaction with someone i'm bringing my wounded parts those wounded feelings i'm bringing those so. share those shareholders with people not just blaming other because you all, are doing this. You okay well how about we own a little bit of our own stuff. yeah. The problem with you, the challenge is going to be your metaphors you're a storyteller and you have fantastic ones and they're very helpful. But they don't let this person that we're most intimate with those are the people in our family and our relationships, they don't, let us in a really let people in and knowing. Our core emotion and so take a second and really pause like, with your son go hold on just a second son. I feel scared that you, you might hide hide hide and that you're going to slip and and not give a crap about school and I know that's a lot about me because I had no one on my but. You see the difference on it before she kind of know what it is you gotta go quiet for a second not speak and figure out what is it it what's going on inside me that's going to teach your children so that they know how they feel. yeah give that a shot this week here what you can do to catch some of those actual emotions inside let's schedule another time to meet Daniel."
