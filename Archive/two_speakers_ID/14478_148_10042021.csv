14478.0,Patient,Sorry.
148.0,Provider,hi Andrew.
14478.0,Patient,How are you today.
148.0,Provider,"i'm doing good, thank you, how are you doing."
14478.0,Patient,"i'm doing all right they had a bit of a hiccup trying to check in and then after waiting for like 15 minutes, I was like well, maybe I can just dial the number directly and that didn't work because you didn't know, I was in here. So I had to call back I ended up calling, in compliance they answered immediately and then told care navigation to get me taking care of so i'm finally here i'm sorry."
148.0,Provider,"Oh that's okay that happens, I apologize for that delay. um I just want to let you know, I do have someone right after you today at 130 so we'll."
14478.0,Patient,Just have.
148.0,Provider,To get them a little bit quicker check in today so um how are you doing since have you been since the last time we met.
14478.0,Patient,"i've been all right um i've been more and more having feelings like this isn't what I need but. yeah I did write down some things like you told me to. They didn't really. Come like as they were happening, but. As I was trying to think of and prepare for talking about it, I was like Oh, I guess, I could put that down but. I was unsure of how it actually. fell into the categories of like stressors and stuff but um."
148.0,Provider,"let's take a step back for a minute, so what makes. me feel like no that's okay what's making you feel. like this isn't what you need."
14478.0,Patient,"Well, for the past couple of weeks, like. Here, will back up to the first reason I called. I was really like obsessing over my heart rate and things like that it was really stressful thinking about it and talking with you and talking with the psychiatrist. It was like well yeah something was going wrong with your heart obviously you're going to be stressed, about that obviously you're going to. have some. Issues handling that etc. Especially because I don't know what's going on. But over the past couple of weeks, I thought about my heart, maybe twice and that feeling of oh my gosh my heart is beating you know is that strange hasn't come back at all. i'm not on any medications or anything because you know i've been having issues getting a new doctor and things like that to get a second opinion on what caused it in the first place so i'm the psychiatrist hasn't been able to get me anything to deal with anything and i'm already. Quote unquote back to normal from before it all happened. And like I said, these stressors and things they're not really."
148.0,Provider,Relevant right now.
14478.0,Patient,"A I mean, like, for example, my finances issue obviously it's something that I should be worrying about it's not something that's like well you know. That shouldn't be a stressor for you that's you know just finances everybody has finances blah blah blah blah blah. I need to find another job and i've been working with uber eats and stuff like that to fix that you know it's. You know, as i'm working to solve the problem that's getting rid of the stressor it's not like i'm replacing that with new stressors and you know needing to solve those as well it's just. You know the issues that I have are because of the pandemic and stuff I don't think that it's anything that's. Right to where I would need long term. assistance with it, I guess you would say. um. I don't know I guess that's why we're having this talk again today so."
148.0,Provider,yeah yeah so what else came up for you as you were writing down stressors.
14478.0,Patient,"um well we went with my in laws and my wife to an apple orchard about an hour and a half away and there were just a bunch of things that happened during that trip that kind of bugged me and I don't know if I would qualify them as stressors that. Like. The car of it we took I was stuffed in the backseat and didn't have very much rain and it was like. This isn't ideal and it bugs me but I don't know if I would completely call it a stressor. My father in law was you know yelling is insults and stuff at random passers by and like one guy tried to park next to us and it wasn't actually a parking spot, but at the same time, it was. You know we're out in the middle of a field and the parking spots were just chalk on the ground, so it didn't really hurt us that he parked next to us, but my father in law was. You know, making comments and stuff about him and being like just kind of nasty but not directly to the person to all of us. And i'm just sitting there thinking like wire, why are you letting this bug you this isn't affecting you at all. And the fact that it bugged him was bugging me, but again I don't know if I would call that a stressor that's just mean and my personality not getting along well with my father in law so. And then, with my brother in law's wife, there were other things throughout the day, where she was calling. Some of the other family members crazy because they wanted to move out to whatever other state that's not California. and saying things like well they don't have doctors out there they're not going to have good dentistry out there and i'm like do you really think that because it's not California New York they don't have doctors that they don't have dentists. And you know I took myself away from that situation and I tried to quietly talk to my wife like do you hear her she's trying to say that. That they don't have doctors out in Florida because it's not California or New York and. she's like you, she shut me down and that bugs me and I tried to talk to her afterwards and explained to her hey I was trying to sidebar with you and make sure i'm not crazy for thinking that you know they have doctors in Florida, because I know people in Florida, and they see doctors. And she then again was like a wall, you know that wasn't really the time to talk about it and i'm like I stepped aside and we weren't anywhere near anyone and she's getting defensive about it, so I feel like I wasn't. bringing it up again in the proper way. Otherwise, she wouldn't have gotten defensive, but you know, again I wouldn't qualify that as as a stressor per se it's just you know interpersonal communications. me having to phrase things differently not something that's going to keep me up at night thinking well I should have said this or that. My brain doesn't work like that."
148.0,Provider,yeah yeah okay.
14478.0,Patient,"And most of you know if I were to qualify a coping mechanism for you know my wife not wanting to talk to me about whatever I just said okay fine whatever and I turned around and put on a YouTube video and. distracted myself from the situation I don't know if I would call that you know coping with it, I don't even know if I would call it dealing with it, but. It doesn't really seem like something that's. going to be solved by therapy I guess is what i'm getting at it's more or less just. Going and talking with her again if it actually bugs me, you know what I mean."
148.0,Provider,"yeah yeah and you seem very aware of what you need like I absolutely think that you know in some situations and timeout or distraction to kind of. cool off little or whatever it may be, is perfectly okay right sometimes when you're trying too hard to to agree with somebody and there's miscommunication you know it just gets all jumbled, so I think that what you did was actually very healthy um. So, how did it feel to kind of think about these things and write them down."
14478.0,Patient,"um. Honestly, it felt like I was doing homework in high school again and I know I talked to you about this before, but. You know I would kind of like I said I didn't write these down in the moment I wrote them down before trying to check in and. Thinking like okay here let's write some things down and what I did to deal with it, because nothing really presented itself as super stressful I didn't have to like stop everything I was doing and. breathe and just like okay we're going to deal with this maybe later, you know, whatever it felt like I was writing in answers for homework on the way to school, like, I always did it wasn't like a lot of work or a lot of mental anguish thinking about it or anything like that it wasn't. It wasn't relieving to write it down either it was just kind of matter of fact, like well these things happened, and this is what I did. So I don't I don't know what to say beyond that."
148.0,Provider,"Okay Okay, no, I appreciate your honesty around that um so what. What are you thinking are your next steps. That you'll stay in the program and, if so, um I want to talk about what you want to get out of it, and if you're thinking that this isn't the right program for you, what would your next steps be."
14478.0,Patient,"well. Like I screwed up over the last couple of days and I didn't pick my new doctor before October 1 I got the list out on like the 29th. And I said Okay, you know we'll call these couple of places and some stuff ended up coming up with my daughter, and I had to help get her out of something something distracted me. And I didn't finish on the 29th of September, and then you know, on the 30th I ended up having to go and deliver for uber eats because we need money and I needed to make something so I went out and made another 40 bucks so that we can afford to buy some things and. Thought you know I can handle this later I can handle this later and they're only 30 days in September so October 1 came and I was like well. Now it's too late now I am stuck with this doctor that doesn't want to see me until November 1 so i'm going to have to figure something out because my insurance they. If you change doctors it. Only takes effect to the first of the month, and since the first of the month, already passed its. So I screwed up. My next steps would probably be you know getting that new doctor and explaining to them hey you know I had this heart palpitation and I haven't had normal bowel movements in like five weeks, we need to figure this out now. And you know deal with that the physical health aspects of it. um. and, obviously, when I think about that it's something that I. Know needs to be taken care of. And it's something that I mean I guess you would say that there's a little bit of worry there but it's not like. it's not like worrying about whether or not it's going to rain tomorrow and cancel my plans it's worrying about my physical health. yeah but I. Once I get all of those ducks in a row, the next steps are to figure out what happened with my heart figure out if something is still happening because you know, Google searches here and they're always tell you you're dying of cancer or whatever so. All those are to be taken with a grain of salt, but there's like three or four different things that it could be based on my searching in well I don't have this symptom, but I have the other two so maybe I don't know. But yeah I need to get that figured out and, like the psychiatrist said, without that second opinion from a doctor looking at my heart, you seeing what's going on there's not really much she can do. And if there's not much to do on that front and there's not much to do with. You know coping with financial issues besides going out and making money to make a financial issue go away. I don't really. see what benefit, there would be in continuing the program the side of. If there was something that was like if I still had that. Obsessive feeling of like okay i've got to check my heart rate i've got to check my blood pressure. I don't know if i'm dying right now and it's not making sense. At least to me like when it happened sure, yes, I had. What some might call ptsd or what some might call. You know a lot of stress definitely stress about the issue, because it was happening to me and it just happened within the last few days, but now that there's some distance from that incident I don't really have those same stressors that all."
148.0,Provider,"yeah I hear what you're saying so, the number one thing for you right now is to get a doctor and really find out what happened. yeah okay um. yeah I mean I think that's important it doesn't sound like you have. Anything coming up for you right now that is detrimental to your health like no stress no anxiety, it sounds like you're coping with things well as they're coming up. But nothing that's really bothering you, to the extent of you know, keeping you up at night right, how is your sleeping how's your eating."
14478.0,Patient,"My sleeping is really good. i'll. get tired when it gets dark I go if i'm not trying to help put my daughter to sleep i'll go into the room watch something on netflix and when I decided to put that away within five minutes i'm asleep. And then i'm sleeping through the night i'm sleeping until you know six or seven in the morning, when my daughter wakes up and stomps her little feet from her room to my room then knocks on the door and. My wife look it up as well i'll go to the bathroom and start our day. Okay, so they're sleeping isn't a problem. The last time sleep was a problem was about two weeks after. My heart did whatever it did."
148.0,Provider,"Okay, all right. um well that's good i'm glad to hear that you're sleeping good um. How are you feeling overall."
14478.0,Patient,"Overall um I feel like I need to lose weight, which I do need to lose weight i'm to 75 right now and i'd like to be at around 175 165. Okay i'm. Because i'm five foot eight. But. I also want to make sure that i'm. not going to hurt myself or my heart by working out too much so right now i've kind of just focused on like I cut, for the first month after the incident with my heart, I cut caffeine completely and now i'm back up to one soda either at lunch or at dinner one soda per day. And everything else is water i'm having like three bottles of water, a day. So i've kind of focused on that. i'm I don't know if i'd say worried, but i'm trying to pay attention to, if my guts feel better eating one thing or another. I know that i've had issues with lactose intolerance and stuff like that so i'm trying to see if there's something else, causing my gut not to behave normally because it doesn't seriously seem like it's stress, but. Who knows it may be something um but that's something i've got to talk to the doctor about as well because it's been going on since the incident with my heart so."
148.0,Provider,"So I think the things that you're doing right now are great right you're really monitoring your body and your coping and your self care and how you're eating, I mean everything that you're doing sounds good to me right now. I really think it's just going to be at this point, taking it one day at a time until you meet with this doctor and you know, to find out more. So why don't we leave it at that, for right now, do you want to schedule your next individual session two weeks out."
14478.0,Patient,um.
148.0,Provider,"What are you thinking you can always go back to virtual clinic if you're not sure what you're going to do right now, if you want to. hold off on scheduling really focused on getting this point with it with your doctor and then figure out a word from there, we can do that if you. Think hey I need to see Ashley for an individual session, things are coming up, you can always go to virtual clinic and set that up. just keep us informed as you go through this process just let us know you know if you do decide that this isn't this program isn't the right fit for you just to so we could discharge you properly and. Okay. Okay, good."
14478.0,Patient,"yeah that sounds good, I don't know whether or not you want to schedule the two, week out."
148.0,Provider,Totally up to you.
14478.0,Patient,"Okay, I would probably say that if I need something i'll call and set up another appointment, but for now I should be fine i'm sorry I know we're running out of time."
148.0,Provider,"No that's Okay, I just want to make sure that you're getting the support that you need and. Then i'm supporting you as best that I can with anything that you're going through right now. And you know we'll just keep keep going one day at a time, keep taking good care of yourself, right now, definitely you try to get a doctor. right that doctor appointments, you can keep advocating for yourself and say I need to know what's. Going on what happened to me, so it doesn't happen again, because that did cause a lot of stress for you right. yeah yeah um but like I said just let us know what you decide if it isn't two weeks, and you haven't had any sessions or anything. Try to just set up at least a quick check in with me so you're not you know missing appointments at that point um but yeah we can definitely take it, you know just take it one day at a time, right now, and go from there. Okay okay."
14478.0,Patient,All right. Thank you Ashley.
148.0,Provider,"yeah, of course, but definitely keep taking good care of yourself."
14478.0,Patient,will do.
148.0,Provider,"Okay, good keep hanging in there you're doing great."
14478.0,Patient,Thank you.
148.0,Provider,"Okay, Andrew well bye."
