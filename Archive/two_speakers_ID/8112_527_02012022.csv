8112.0,Patient,"i'm i'm doing pretty good today. I keep getting like these colds, though. And I don't know what like all of January have basically been sick. I think I just need to like advocate to get my tonsils taken out."
527.0,Provider,huh okay.
8112.0,Patient,"Because they have been causing me issue. Mental health wise. I don't know how I am like I always want to be better. I. ended up like. Being a mom yesterday and like crying for a bit. Okay, but it's because I have these dreams sometimes that are like. My mom and my stepdad and, like my life back then, when all like the trauma was happening. And then I wake up and I don't feel real. And so i'm just like messed up."
527.0,Provider,Okay.
8112.0,Patient,or a lot of the day.
527.0,Provider,"or there's happening more frequently, you know."
8112.0,Patient,"I mean I didn't use to really have it, but i've been having it. Like once a month. Okay we're like a bit. um. yeah I have really intense dreams and a lot of the time they're not pleasant."
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
8112.0,Patient,"So, like whenever I dream of like my. Before life it's usually bad. Especially anything with my step dad in it like i'm an insanely triggered so. yeah."
527.0,Provider,"So, what are you ready to work on in regards to that."
8112.0,Patient,Oh.
527.0,Provider,Where do you feel like you want to start working on that.
8112.0,Patient,"Well i've done like work previously with it, but I just keep remembering new things. news is just a really like. Because my life is so different now since i've like become an adult unlike separated myself from all that. it's almost like it feels unreal that all of that happens. But then I remember, and like i'm reminded when i'm like. Having mental health things related to it i'm like oh I. guess, this is still bothering me."
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
8112.0,Patient,"It was just like a lot of abuse, for a long time, and sometimes I think like Oh, maybe it wasn't that bad and i'm just like blowing it out of proportion until I tell people about it and they're like. And they always say, the one thing that I hate the most is how are you still alive and i'm like. spite. yeah so."
527.0,Provider,"So what, what do you feel like you're ready to tackle in regards to past trauma."
8112.0,Patient,Oh really any of it it's just like what exactly are we going to do to tackle it.
527.0,Provider,"What do you feel like you need to be able to move past it. Right. Or what what it would look like, for you to be able to you know close that chapter for yourself."
8112.0,Patient,"I don't know, I just want to feel like. safe. Okay, and. Like not have emotional reactions when things remind me. of that time of my life."
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
8112.0,Patient,"cuz it's really hard to like do Grad school and do like. therapy, with people if I get triggered by my own shit."
527.0,Provider,Sure yeah.
8112.0,Patient,it's just it's like an icky feeling like I can't clean myself of.
527.0,Provider,Okay mm hmm.
8112.0,Patient,"And I don't know I just. I know it's like part of me like I went through all of that, and now i'm like who I am but like. I hate. Other people's reactions when they find out about it also. Okay, because they're just like. they're either like more careful with me."
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
8112.0,Patient,"or they like do that pity thing or they just like feel bad for me. Okay, and i'm just like I don't really want to be like pitied or baby because of this, I just want to not. cringe when I think about my past or like get emotionally dis regulated."
527.0,Provider,So what do you want to talk about today in regards to it.
8112.0,Patient,"Oh um. I think my biggest thing like what is affecting me most is the fact that, like my life growing up was very, very controlled."
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
8112.0,Patient,"And now I have to like. do things where I set my own like. rules or boundaries and i'm very bad at. When he knows what well. Knowing myself, you probably shouldn't. Like eat that many sweets because it's not good for you, but my brains like doble means really nice and you know one's gonna call you fat fatty if you do that anymore and i'm like yeah that's nice, but like I don't feel good when I do that. or I don't know life just seems a lot more like. i'm unprepared for all of the ways I have to be able to like. I don't know interact socially or like. motivate myself to do things are like I don't know cuz everything was so controlled and now everything is open."
527.0,Provider,yeah it's like. it's like all or nothing.
8112.0,Patient,yeah and I don't really like that.
527.0,Provider,So we got to find a balance. yeah okay.
8112.0,Patient,"cuz. it's just like I realized, a lot of things that I have been like struggling with like a bunch of stuff for Grad schools, because people expect me to like. Do I don't want to say, do things for myself, but like be used to. Like making my needs that are like. letting people know what I need in order to like get it and I don't. know how to do that."
527.0,Provider,"What are your what were your priorities right now, you know, like where do we, where do you want to focus on the we can start with like like there's if if there's one thing that I need to have in place that would help me, and then we kind of build on that. Like to find that balance. Like is it just even identifying what your needs are."
8112.0,Patient,It is. it's a sad is that kinda cuz.
527.0,Provider,Okay okay. Why is that sad.
8112.0,Patient,"Because people should know what they need, but I like only dealt with addressing other people's needs and like ignoring my own."
527.0,Provider,"So, are you and where you allowed to have needs."
8112.0,Patient,"No. mm hmm I wasn't allowed to. So, like it's. it's hard to ask for help. um when like clearly I can't do something on my own. But like I don't I don't know how to let myself do that and I don't know how to do that. effectively and appropriately. Okay, because it's like my inner child, just like screams when I have to do that. mm hmm, and so I get emotional. don't need to. Because it's just like I. i've never had the chance to just be like hey I need this."
527.0,Provider,"Well, we can work on that. what's what's one need that you feel like you. could start with on the list, like it, that you can identify. Is there an immediate need you have right now."
8112.0,Patient,"I mean. I do need. Like help with Grad school stuff from my like clinical coordinator. Okay, but like he doesn't. really help cuz he's like overwhelmed. But like I need to know like when I was an undergrad you could just go to like the floor, where my like like the psychology department was on."
527.0,Provider,Okay you're.
8112.0,Patient,"Trying to all the papers, you could need to tell you anything about your Program. Okay don't have that with this like I don't. I don't make my own class schedule I don't like. really have like I just signed up and they're like okay here's your classes attend them and I don't know like what papers, I need to turn in all the time, or like. What i'm supposed to be like having accomplished because it's not like papers that I just have in hand because they just kind of control that but I. And they expect me to know, like all these things like I don't know and it's too late for me to be like hey I know i've been in this program for like two years but I don't know anything about it."
527.0,Provider,I just.
8112.0,Patient,had my classes. And it's just it's like it's too late to ask those questions.
527.0,Provider,"Well, why is it to."
8112.0,Patient,be like you should have known her how.
527.0,Provider,"Okay. All right, but this is where we're at, so we need to get some direction it sounds like. yeah who who's your connection at school, like do you have a go to person or a director of some sort or coordinator."
8112.0,Patient,"So I have. jenna who is like the person who. Signed me up for all of my classes and like handles that stuff, then I have billy who's in charge of all my practical stuff. And like. i'm pretty sure i'm supposed to turn in like my see us to him and stuff to graduate but like trying. To get him to like meet with you one on one is in the thing like he has office hours. But i'm never available. For and then, when you go, you have to wait your turn where you're just all sitting there watching a person like talk to him about things and it's weird. it's weird and like he's just overwhelmed so he doesn't help like when I looked into this program they're like yeah I know we can help you find practical placements and all that, and he just said, I don't know figure it out, and I was like. How. yeah well how do I search and he just said, Google mental health in your area and. Like contact places, and I have. And I like called all the places, and when I was doing that it was when it was before. On the Crown and all that stuff and it was like before we opened up again before we're now like closing back down again so like no place was there, like we're not taking any practical students, because no one's even in the offices. So it's just been like. A battle, so when I do reach out it's like i'm not even getting my needs met Ben because, like he's overwhelmed and he lets you know it."
527.0,Provider,sounds like a jerk.
8112.0,Patient,"He is an asshole he's an asshole jenna's also She answered all my questions but she's not the one I go to for a lot of the things I need answers for and he is, but he sucks."
527.0,Provider,So who's above him Hannah.
8112.0,Patient,I don't know the guy that's in charge of the whole Program. he's really nice but. I feel weird because I have weird issues with like authority and being able to just like. interact with them normally.
527.0,Provider,"Okay, so we're going to come up with a plan of how to interact with him because it sounds like we just need to go above billy the jerk. yeah okay. Is there things like if you had to make a list of needs that you have and questions that you have is their list for jenna and is their list for."
8112.0,Patient,You don't really know his name.
527.0,Provider,billy's boss.
8112.0,Patient,i'm.
527.0,Provider,"Like can you. Can you identify like what your needs and questions are like and and write them down. yeah Okay, and then, can you email like formulate an email and send it to jenna and say hey here's. You know i'm just checking in i've got a lot of questions and thoughts as i've been in this program and need some clarification on things. One bullet point data da This is my question to bullet point you know and just kind of go and let you know if there's things that she can eat you know what put it on there, she doesn't know it, you know and let her respond to it and say, oh no but here's who you need to contact. And then, whatever questions that you have for billy like I need some clarification and direction and be very specific Hannah like."
8112.0,Patient,"How, for, and he just like come to my office hours like one of the time I said, do I need your help on this stuff or, can I just move forward. And he said come to my office hours, I went to his office hours with for like a week later, and he just said, oh no, you can do that on your own, and I was like, why did you answer that. And my email I wasted a whole week turns up. Here, this out."
527.0,Provider,"yeah, so I think it's an you know what we're going to we're going to kind of be jerks about it now, you know we're going to email billy and we're going to see see his boss oh."
8112.0,Patient,"yeah cuz like and and, like the whole department knows he's like this, because so many people have complained, which is why they hired on to more people but they're all from northern California. mill is only one for southern California and i'm in southern California. So i'm like okay."
527.0,Provider,"So now we're going to have to be a jerk. yeah yeah we're going to be a jerk because you have needs that need to be met and clarified and. it's not that we're not going to be professional about it and assertive about it but we're gonna we're going to get a little bit more. more aggressive assertive with it like before it goes on too much further and then you feel more and more overwhelmed or lost, and if his boss needs to step in, then so be it. Like he needs to be accountable for his staff people helping students, like you, shouldn't and you know what Hannah I totally get where you're at because. I remember my practical, it was my last. yeah it was my last one to graduate and my practical director was never, never came once to see me never contacted my supervisor that I was working with and when we scheduled my review at the end of the Semester she she didn't show up."
8112.0,Patient,Oh.
527.0,Provider,"And so I went directly to the Dean, with an email. And, and my supervisor said, you are likely my last in problem probably will be my last student I take from the school. Because this is unacceptable. I got absolutely no supervision from the school and so i'm like you I didn't know. You know that I like."
8112.0,Patient,"Well, provision from school."
527.0,Provider,"You need to send this in you need to send this portfolio and I was like nope i'm not sending a portfolio am because this is my work, this is my portfolio and that I will never get back. And you don't deserve it, because you didn't come, and so I think it is helping you to feel okay. Knowing I can set these limits and expectations like this is their job that's what they're supposed to be helping you with in answering these questions. Like you're not just pulling them out of thin air, like Oh, maybe this is what I need to be doing like no they have standards and guidelines that they have to follow, and so we need to hold them accountable so yeah we'll just loop in his boss. You know and and I think for you it's maybe prefacing the email saying i'm coming back i'm coming back to you with some additional questions and need for clarification, the last time I was at your office hours. You know I didn't feel I got the direction I needed, and this is, and because I think the his boss needs to hear that too and that's not being you know, maybe we are being a little bit of a jerk with that, but you know it wasn't helpful and you're just stating the facts. For yourself."
8112.0,Patient,yeah cuz it's just been like. a bunch of me not knowing quite what i'm doing and I don't really function well with that anyone else.
527.0,Provider,I know.
8112.0,Patient,And then my practice and placement they don't know what they're doing so it's just more not knowing what i'm doing and i'm expecting me to come in and like fix things for them. And i'm like. where's my gun.
527.0,Provider,Right exactly.
8112.0,Patient,yeah because my supervisor they're. Like. she's only there as a favor to our like QA person.
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
8112.0,Patient,And our QA person that's going to leave very soon so she's gonna leave. And then we're just. booked.
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
8112.0,Patient,yeah I think.
527.0,Provider,I was actually in G does that feel like a direction to take with with your school at this point like do.
8112.0,Patient,What do you mean.
527.0,Provider,Like formulating some emails with specific questions and needs that you have.
8112.0,Patient,"I can I could do that usually, when I email jenna's because i'm like having a breakdown and I sent her like a very clearly emotional email she responds back very kind lands like No, this is all the information you need don't worry. But also today i'm having a. stark meeting I don't know I don't know what that stands for, but essentially. it's a meeting where they're saying you got an F in this class, do you think you deserve it and I get to say my heart, and I have to be like yeah because I never had time to do any of the work, because I work too much, and I had too many classes that term. But i'm still going to be like, how do I retake this class, which is why i'm showing up."
527.0,Provider,Because.
8112.0,Patient,"They said they're not offering it online anymore, which is stupid because they have an online program and i'm pretty sure couples therapy Part B. is necessary. and they're like well you can't take it on the campus either because you're part of the online program and i'm like, but if I could physically get to the campus when it's offered, why can I not do both."
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
8112.0,Patient,Like So what if it takes multiple months longer than my online program which is because I do. Terms online so everything is two months long. Every two months I have different classes i'm at the campuses it's like a whole semester.
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
8112.0,Patient,And i'm like.
527.0,Provider,So you're like in an accelerated program basically.
8112.0,Patient,yeah and i'm like I can stretch it out that long.
527.0,Provider,"yeah yeah what's another you know, two months or some you know eight weeks if, in the Grand scheme of the picture here."
8112.0,Patient,"Like it's a lesson okay. And so that's I will be attending that after so i'm i'm here with you, and then I have class for three hours, where I have to give a like a case presentation and like show video of work i've done. With the kids I work with which is always interesting because they are characters. They they are some characters um and because i've been sick I haven't gotten new footage, so this is actually like. The same 45 minutes that I presented last term."
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
8112.0,Patient,"Well, just present like a different part of it. What it's always like that's anxiety. And then I have to go do that and i'm just like. Today is great. But like i've been. feeling better with knowing like I have a scheduled today, like, I have a timeline, of all things i'm going to do. Okay, so like I got up i'm showered i'm dressed when i'm done here i'm going to pick out like part of the video i'm going to show and then. put on literally just eyeliner and mascara and put my hair down put on my blazer and be like set for prison presentation, because it's an informal one. Okay, so I just have to be like these are the demographics, this is the theories I didn't use a theory i'm gonna be honest. I do art therapy a lot with the girls I work with. Because they respond best to that."
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
8112.0,Patient,"But, if anything, I would have to do something heavily based an attachment because it's all attachment issues."
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
8112.0,Patient,which makes sense because they're CPS kids in a group home.
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
8112.0,Patient,"yeah. I don't know I feel better when. I have a lot to do, but organized. Yes, that's what I function, the."
527.0,Provider,"Best Okay, how is that different from growing up."
8112.0,Patient,"it's not it was just what I mean. growing up. Like. woke up already school went to school had to come home you do your chores then you're locked in your room and you're not allowed to come out. or talk unless they call you, for whatever stupid reason they have. But like. The thing is, is like even then, like, I never had I was never checked for like my schoolwork if it was completed or any of that like I just did it by myself, like I made sure it was always done."
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
8112.0,Patient,"And like. All i'm terrible and I do this thing where i'll complete a whole thing and then, if it's not perfect, it won't turn it in, even though i've done all the work and i've always been like that. Always. I don't want to turn in work it's not perfect."
527.0,Provider,Because what will happen.
8112.0,Patient,i'll feel like a failure okay.
527.0,Provider,So there's it there it is.
8112.0,Patient,Yes.
527.0,Provider,"And how much, are you feeling like a failure right now."
8112.0,Patient,"All the time completely okay and, like every aspect of my life."
527.0,Provider,Is that accurate.
8112.0,Patient,"Probably not. i'm like probably not it's just i'm not. Where I want to be like I spent too many days just. sleeping and recovering from things and then having no motivation. To do the things I need to well that's a lie, I have a lot of motivation and I get paralyzed by the anxiety, I have about things."
527.0,Provider,Okay.
8112.0,Patient,So I end up not doing anything and making my life worse.
527.0,Provider,"And how much is the depression playing into that too, like is there any improvement in your in your Depression and anxiety."
8112.0,Patient,"The thing is, is like I don't really like on my meds I don't really feel things, except for a big sense of emptiness. Okay, and sad like anything else is like a very surface not real emotion like I can't feel my anger. which I used to use a lot to motivate myself. Okay, I like. Like even like anxiety is like hollow so it doesn't like I can't functionally use it, because it's just like. You should be anxious about this normally. But you just don't. Okay, so I just don't feel. Inside is that bothersome yeah."
527.0,Provider,"Okay. What are your what are your meds right now, you know."
8112.0,Patient,"I take wellbutrin and effect, sir."
527.0,Provider,Okay.
8112.0,Patient,"And she tried to put me on what to do, but I literally like barfed it up every time I tried to take it. Okay, like. Take it with food stillbirth so you without food still bar like just like instantly vomiting."
527.0,Provider,Has there been a medic medication regimen that's worked well for you that you haven't just completely numbed out your emotions.
8112.0,Patient,"yeah. um So when I was in undergrad I was on your trip dylan. Which is like I didn't want to go back on it, because it makes you gain weight. Sure, and but you know what, if I could actually function. On on it, and like feel my emotions and get shit done. I would take it in a heartbeat, even if they made me fatter because you know what I could do on it go to the gym. get my work done be productive. Or it was just at a time before I really went to therapy."
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
8112.0,Patient,"And I still had a fear, well, I still have a few fear of failure so. I just like the only person i'm disappointing now is myself okay. But no, I like was on a pretty low dose of that and. was like. I felt so good, I went off of it for two years shouldn't have done that. But ya know it worked for me."
527.0,Provider,"Did you have suicidal thoughts on it, no. Have you talked to me about that about that."
8112.0,Patient,"She has her own agenda when it comes to my mind, like i've talked to her, she never really listened to me. Ever i've talked to her a lot about it and, like she still thinks i'm bipolar. um i've literally. Never had enough energy to be manic unless my mania is like little bits of frustration. Where i'm just irritable."
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
8112.0,Patient,"But. She has like her own i'm pretty sure I just have untreated ADHD. That is contributing to all the factors that make me depressed and anxious, but she was giving me Ritalin and it wasn't working."
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
8112.0,Patient,"And then, when you try to talk to her about it, she acts like your drug seeking. And it doesn't make me feel higher anything it literally like I took a nap when I took it. Because like I learned, you had to take it with food or also just put you to sleep."
527.0,Provider,Okay.
8112.0,Patient,Which is not what stimulants are supposed to do.
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
8112.0,Patient,And wellbutrin is a stimulant and effects or as a steward so like. where's my energy Why am I not getting it Why am I still depressed. and unable to do anything. When all I want. is to do things.
527.0,Provider,mm hmm mm hmm.
8112.0,Patient,"And it's like. i'm paralyzed by. A worry that I won't. get all the things done, I need to so I don't do anything and it's like what what do I do with that."
527.0,Provider,it's a vicious cycle and you've gotten in yeah.
8112.0,Patient,"And yeah and married isn't really like listen. So i've booked appointments with her before to like talk about it, and she ends up just like talking over me. And being like yeah well i'm just really concerned because you're depressed all the time and i'm like hey these are like things I need to dress and she's like no. I think you need blah blah blah things that don't actually apply to me because she has an idea of who, I am in her head that's not who I am."
527.0,Provider,"Do you have an appointment love the. Media oh sorry go ahead, you know."
8112.0,Patient,"I will say she has that like sweet mother voice that like. gets me every time where I just i'm like oh Okay, but it's just like mommy issues. And I don't know how to like be like. you're not listening to me."
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
8112.0,Patient,So I just avoid talking to her.
527.0,Provider,What would you like to ask her.
8112.0,Patient,"What can I do like, how can we. treat my ADHD. Without like. Putting me on a bunch of weird ass meds because, like i've struggled with what like accepting the amount of MED she's given me because I hate feeling. Okay, but, like everything i've all the different MED combos i've done there I feel no. Okay, then completely off my bed it's like I feel and."
527.0,Provider,"yeah yeah again it it's finding that balance for you and that's why I asked like has there been a medication regimen that's work that you felt like I am functioning i'm managing my emotions i'm not feeling, yes I you know I have emotions, but I can manage them and experience them. And function throughout the day like they they're not you know dragging me back down like I can work with them."
8112.0,Patient,Like.
527.0,Provider,I was on.
8112.0,Patient,Your trip dylan and I don't know if I can say I was like I felt good.
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
8112.0,Patient,"But I don't know that was just because I finally got away from being at home. And I don't even know if, like. Okay, I don't know if it was actually like because I got diagnosed with depression like after I started taking birth control, which can cause depression. And my brother dead. So I was grieving. Sure, but then, once you start like on meds going off of them everything just feels very intense, where I was like I could deal with this before, and now I suddenly can't because i'm used to not dealing with it. So. it's just like I don't want to be known, I just want to be able to handle all of my emotions again. Okay, and. I don't know if I can ever get back to that. Without taking meds which i'm fine taking meds but they always make me feel numb. And like that's the. off i'd rather feel everything I rather feel everything, the only problem is when I. was the last time I went off of them, I was not in a good place and also, I had heavy copper poisoning from an iud. um so I, I would like cry for like two hours every morning. Is me. Unbelievably, sad. But I also had like heavy metal poisoning. vince."
527.0,Provider,well. Are you on birth control right now.
8112.0,Patient,"You know yeah I take I take like the birth control pills Okay, apparently, I have hormonal acne. So when I go off birth control, I look like a pizza. yeah. But like. I just I want to be able to get my shit done and I want to be able to feel things because it's very important to me. To be able to feel my emotions a lot, because I use them functionally. Like with anger, I can I can exercise, and I can get shit done. Even if it's just out of spite I can do that, where I like use it up effectively until i'm not feeling like that anymore. With anxiety. I will actually get up on time for things and I will actually like do the things I need to do because, like yeah it kind of sucks being like. i'm worried about this, but also like i've gotten to a place where I realized. Most people don't care what the Fuck you're doing they're not paying attention to you they're trying to exist themselves so like. I understand that unless socially anxious, which I realized, I was a lot more socially just before, because I was literally locked in my house for years and then suddenly I was thrown into a place where I knew no one."
527.0,Provider,sure.

527.0,Provider,Do you have an appointment with Mary anytime soon no.
8112.0,Patient,"No, I didn't bother with it cuz I didn't think she listened to me. And I didn't want another human ignoring me. When i'm literally trying to get my needs met. When i'm already struggling to ask people get my needs."
527.0,Provider,"So do you want to do the same thing, like it can you guys email her or."
8112.0,Patient,um.
527.0,Provider,With questions or does she want you to come to an.
8112.0,Patient,Agreement should rather have me go to an.
527.0,Provider,"Appointment okay. So do we want to do the same thing as we're doing like with the school like making a list of questions and here's how I fell on this medication and I would like to you know try this and see you know if it if it's as effective as it was before. You know you're also in a different kind of place in life too, but. yeah but at the same time you've got some additional support around you with therapy and so. You know if it's something that. That you feel like. You know, and those there something that I can try to you know for my attention and concentration, or do we want to just start with the nor trip to lean that's nc you know if how that makes a difference because you're going to have to wean off the effects are because you can't."
8112.0,Patient,Oh yeah I am. In the world view it and i've done it with the wellbutrin and it is hard.
527.0,Provider,it's.
8112.0,Patient,still hard brains up.

527.0,Provider,"You want to email it to me, and then I can. And I can you know. email it to her."
8112.0,Patient,"All. I wanted to try. meeting with her first and then, if it doesn't go well. i'll try."
527.0,Provider,"yeah I think just kind of writing a script out as far as what you want to say and and what you feel like you want her to hear most from you. Like kind of just maybe taken maybe checking checking in where you're at emotionally with with that you know anxiety or fear of you know, using my voice or fear fail you're not being heard like recognize those feelings are there. But here's what I need I need to say like here's my voice in that."
8112.0,Patient,"question. answer, are you. Just filling in for Rebecca or taking over the groups online, I am taking over that group on Monday. it's like a little weird. Because I was like. Okay, be in a group setting."
527.0,Provider,"what's weird like me, being the group leader or."
8112.0,Patient,"it's, just like the dynamic will definitely be different than. With Rebecca only because. She like you will actually treat me like a client, which will be nice. But also, Michelle makes me really uncomfortable. because she does this thing where she's like. Trying to be buddy buddy with everyone in the group and like says really emotion filled things when she doesn't really know you and it's more like she's trying to meet some kind of like emotional need through the people in the group. When it's like i'm not here to be your emotional support person i'm here for my own stuff."
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
8112.0,Patient,"But then, like you could see her pout when you're just i'm just trying to exist in this group i'm not necessary i'm not really trying to make friends i'm trying to do like therapy stuff and then go live my life. But she's just a lot okay."
527.0,Provider,But it's also okay to read to build a support system for you too.
8112.0,Patient,I know.
527.0,Provider,"mm hmm I know that's a challenge and i'm and i'm not saying you know there's definitely lots of dynamics in a group setting for sure and i've only been in the group what twice now so i'm not you know. totally aware of you know all the diet, you know i've because it's still new to me so i'm still learning everybody as well for group but yeah I mean there's definitely you know ways to use the group to your recovery process to."
8112.0,Patient,"yeah I don't know. My reaction is because i'm not like familiar with. Friends anymore, because, like. I don't know I don't have any friends, where i'm at right now. So all my friends are like long distance. And because we're all just trying to like get through our lives, right now, we don't communicate that much. So I don't know if i'm just like not as familiar with friendship. More if, like. I legit just feel like. she's trying to get free emotional Labor."
527.0,Provider,"mm hmm. Which is been your experience with people. yeah okay. yeah and you know what you have to pay attention to that for yourself like you have to listen, listen to your gut if it's saying you know you might need to pull back a little bit on this or. be aware of you know, some boundaries for yourself, or how can I be assertive you know with her or with whoever in the group setting to like it's okay to use your voice and stand up and go, you know I just don't have that capability, or the you know space to hold that today. yeah."
8112.0,Patient,yeah.
527.0,Provider,But but it's also trying to find those healthy. Healthy supports and relationships for yourself to.
8112.0,Patient,yeah I tend to take on friends that end up needing more for me than I can get from them and then I feel. worn out and almost like resentful.

527.0,Provider,"Okay, and the number one assignment is writing down what my needs are."
