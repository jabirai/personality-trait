510.0,Provider,"you're working, are you in a private space."
13357.0,Patient,Yes. yeah i'm in my my booth.
510.0,Provider,"Oh God Okay, I just want to make sure you have privacy and you can talk freely alright, so this is sort of our first session post that intake in a couple weeks so give me a quick update how have you been doing around your sobriety."
13357.0,Patient,"group brought good my my our lives good, the only thing I have a problem with is my anxiety."
510.0,Provider,"Okay yeah you talked about having like full blown panic attacks, so are they continuing daily weekly. Daily daily Okay, and what Chris what tends to set them off, is there a particular trigger or a does it seem like it comes out of nowhere."
13357.0,Patient,Just comes out of nowhere.
510.0,Provider,"Okay Okay, and you don't and there's nothing that kind of starts happening that you start thinking about it just literally you feel like it comes out of nowhere. yeah okay Okay, what do you tend to do in that moment to try to to manage."
13357.0,Patient,"I try to close my eyes and breathe. Okay, sometimes that doesn't help and what if i'm at home, I try to go to sleep."
510.0,Provider,Okay.
13357.0,Patient,Okay that's not healthy user.
510.0,Provider,"Well, it depends, I mean obviously if it's bedtime that could be a natural you know time to just you know what i'm going to try to lay down, but if it's like two o'clock in the afternoon. That can you know it depends I wouldn't say it's very unhealthy I think you're trying to do things to kind of manage the symptoms. Now, one of the things that I often introduce clients to. I do share and help you go through some additional breathing techniques, because i'm curious the breathing that you're describing where did you learn, it is it just your on your."
13357.0,Patient,own no it's the fight or flight breathing.
510.0,Provider,"The fighter flight Okay, because there's lots of different breathing techniques out there i'm happy."
13357.0,Patient,Calm down and combat.
510.0,Provider,"OK OK, I wonder if it's the box breath but okay there's lots of different ones i'm happy to show you an additional one i'm also happy to show you or walk you through. it's a mindfulness meditation it is called the game of fives because a lot of times, if we are having panic, if we can get out of our head and because what's happened when you escalate to having a panic attack often what's associated is very intrusive thoughts."
13357.0,Patient,And so we want to try to.
510.0,Provider,"help you get out of your thoughts and more into your body, and to do that is through meditation. And would you feel kind of."
13357.0,Patient,i'm sorry meditate every day.
510.0,Provider,"Okay, do you want me to take you through the game of fives I don't know if you've been introduced to this one."
13357.0,Patient,"done already, my last. My last doctor."
510.0,Provider,Your last doctor. Your last doctor.
13357.0,Patient,yeah my last sobriety therapist.
510.0,Provider,"Okay Okay, so do you not is that a no you don't want to go through that."
13357.0,Patient,"I mean it tends to work, but sometimes the panic attacks like make me feel like i'm having a heart attack."
510.0,Provider,mm hmm yeah well and that's the scary part because you start to have physical sensations and then we start to have thoughts that you know because I would imagine what are your thoughts going through your head when you start to have. The physical sensations Chris.
13357.0,Patient,i'm having a fucking hard check.
510.0,Provider,Exactly so when you start to have those intrusive thoughts.
13357.0,Patient,"That will then immediately blood pressure, after I take my blood pressure and realize it's Okay, then i'm able to gather my head. it's annoying I can i'm i've been trying to get my physician and give me something to stop this shit. He gave me boost bar, but they give me a damn headache."
510.0,Provider,"yeah and because Julie, she manages the suboxone she doesn't prescribe any of the psych meds correct. No right okay yeah so that's going to be between you and your other prescriber. Well, so part of what's happening Chris is when you have the acting activating event with anxiety. You start to have the intrusive thoughts, one of the best ways is doing breath work and mindfulness meditation to try to get you out of the thoughts into your body. And that typically helps but sometimes you almost have to write out when it's a full blown panic attack I know it's scary Have you ever ended up in the er for a panic attack. Yes, yeah Okay, and so you've had a full workup and there's no no underlying cardiac issues is that correct. No okay and that's good right, so you know there's no history there, so when you start having those thoughts. You know."
13357.0,Patient,i'm sorry i'm at work i'm trying to listen to you and work.
510.0,Provider,"I know that this is not really appropriate to have therapy when you're at work so i'm wondering if you we can close up because it's really difficult to provide therapy if you're at work. So I know we have another session Chris scheduled, are you going to be at work for that session as well do we need to modify the date and the time."
13357.0,Patient,What data is and what time.
510.0,Provider,"let's see I know we scheduled to appointments, so let me try to find you on my calendar. that's interesting, let me pull up your chart real quick because i'm not seeing."
13357.0,Patient,When you had your emergency they didn't reschedule the second one.
510.0,Provider,"Oh that's right Chris you were you were on my list last week and yeah i'm so sorry, yes, I was out for an unexpected. Family issue you're right so that's why i'm not seeing you so I have you our next appointment on Monday September 20 actually it's next week it's 1030 your time because you're Eastern are you going to be at work at that time, do we need to modify this."
13357.0,Patient,1030 at night.
510.0,Provider,No 1030 in the morning.
13357.0,Patient,yeah it's fun keep desire to work after nature night turn.
510.0,Provider,"Okay perfect now the other issue, and I was hoping to share this with you last week but life was really quite interesting and unpredictable last week for me. I actually have tendered my resignation with bright heart at the end of August and I started notify my caseload on September for so i've given a month's notice. You are on my list to notify last week, but I was not able to, as you know. So I need to let you know that your prescriber Julie kane and your groups those will remain the same, but after October 1 which is my last day. With bright heart you'll be assigned a new individual therapist so we'll have our our final session next week, but I wanted to give you that heads up Chris. I know i'm sorry I know we just started working. yeah and the timing of last week was not anticipated at all, but I I have given bright heart plenty of time to make sure there's a smooth transition for you okay. All right, well, I appreciate I know it's a short session i'm going to cut it short, because you are working and we'll just we'll have a it sounds like a better time next Monday, since you will not be at work. sounds good. Okay, have a good one, Chris."
