416.0,Provider,"thing, and I was like as my hair been sticking up is like this, I think it's been good like this, the whole day."
9145.0,Patient,And then I don't know I just realized it.
416.0,Provider,"So Anyway, thank you hi how are you."
9145.0,Patient,i'm doing okay.
416.0,Provider,"Now, are you still feeling pretty overwhelmed got a lot going on."
9145.0,Patient,yeah i'm not really doing too well this week.
416.0,Provider,Tell me what's going on.
9145.0,Patient,"Well, I made it through my mom's visit which kind of like got cut short because. My my girlfriend D got. A positive covert test."
416.0,Provider,Oh no.
9145.0,Patient,"Though yeah so I did see I saw my mom a couple of times, but then I was like well I get I can't see you again because, like, then that would risk like exposing you. So yeah so then so didn't get sick is kind of weird and I don't know I almost wonder if it was like a false positive. test or something, but who knows. But she never got sick but we're like we had to quarantine like in the House for 10 days like separately. And like wearing masks in the House. So that I didn't get it, and it was like three weeks all together until I actually was able to go back to work, so I was like out of work for three weeks and. Oh, my gosh yeah like I don't get covert pay or anything I would nanny. um. So yeah it kind of just like it disrupted my my schedule and my routine which I was kind of like just starting to kind of get in in a row with like. yeah I was like. There was some nice parts about it, like I could like just focus on school for a few weeks. And, but I don't know mostly I was just like just feeling really cooped up. and weird."
416.0,Provider,Right and kind of stressing about.
9145.0,Patient,related totally discombobulated and kind of like you know just worried about money and. So this week is my first week back at work and i'm like having a hard time adjusting the days are going by really slowly. And I don't know I feel like a little bit like traumatized by the whole thing.
416.0,Provider,yeah you do.
9145.0,Patient,"Yes, super stressful."
416.0,Provider,"i'm sorry that's a lot. So um. Okay, one thing at a time right because you've got new to the. Which one which one do you want to tackle first the moms thing the routine thing. Right thinking."
9145.0,Patient,"um well actually what I wanted to talk about I think. Maybe to get like your insight on some way I can. remedy this. i've been like waking up. Like in the middle of the night super like stressed and, like in the mornings is like kind of unusual for me like I wake up, I wake up really stressed out like in the mornings. Like before my alarm goes off like before it's even time for me to get up. or kind of like i'm just like thinking, like all these really fucked up heavy thoughts, you know, like like stuff about like you know, did I do the right thing, like did I like abandon my family, you know, like my ex husband and my kids. You know, like are my kids ever going to like forgive me i'm. Good I like are all the best years of my life behind me like really."
416.0,Provider,Like kind of.
9145.0,Patient,"Disturbing stuff like is there anything else good to do in life, like why you know just it's not the way I want to be like basing the day."
416.0,Provider,So when you ask yourself those questions when you start to ponder those questions what comes up for you.
9145.0,Patient,i'm usually like kind of the worst answers. yeah.
416.0,Provider,that's what I was worried about I must have fucked up by leaving I should have stuck with it i've messed up the best years of my life for over right so it's not necessarily questions it's it's it's This must be true.
9145.0,Patient,"yeah it's like it's like a. question, but then I am kind of. answering it I, and I just kind of lay in bed and stew over it, and think like oh my God like is that right like could that be right. And yeah it's it's very disturbing."
416.0,Provider,Has anything changed with your medication.
9145.0,Patient,"No. I mean I I switched from. Like a regular pill to an extended release like, but that was like a week ago, and this has been going on for more than a week. So I don't think it's correlated with that. and"
416.0,Provider,It may be time to start a couple things it may be. time to do a MED review.
9145.0,Patient,mm hmm.
416.0,Provider,"And, to see if you need an adjustment somewhere, because what you're describing is a pretty serious increase in Depression and anxiety right. yeah it's a big increase in really negative thoughts about yourself we call it, you know we call them cognitive distortions I call them brain weasels right because they get in there, they route around and they just mess everything up. And so there's you're describing a really big increase in those. And it's interfering with your functioning, so we get concerned right, so I definitely think a MED review is an order and then tell me how so to some extent I would expect a little bit of an increase in your anxiety right because you've got a lock away. And you've had and you've had some setbacks backs. Does any of what was what happened, does it coordinate with your mom's visit at all."
9145.0,Patient,"No, not really I was already having these. This happen."
416.0,Provider,Did it get worse after she was there. are better. or.
9145.0,Patient,Dave I think it it got like a little bit worse like during the whole like coven thing because it stressful. But it's been kind of going on for like. A little like it's gotten progressively worse. But I feel like it's been going on for a little while like where i'm just like I kind of gradually have gotten like more depressed. Like we're like things that I used to really like. i'm not finding like joy. In them anymore.
416.0,Provider,uh huh. What do you on me okay Rita.
9145.0,Patient,i'm taking abilify.
416.0,Provider,"Okay, I mean i'm not a medication expert How long have you been on it, and it is it been a while."
9145.0,Patient,um i've been on it for this before I move so like maybe like six or seven months. yeah.
416.0,Provider,"Okay, and so shanteau who share our provider."
9145.0,Patient,Okay tanya.
416.0,Provider,Oh it's tiny okay. yeah.
9145.0,Patient,"Well then, also like one kind of crappy thing that happened with my meds like was that I was taking. adderall for my add, but then. It started to bother my stomach so I switched over to a different one. Which is dex methylphenidate. Is what it's called and it's a lot easier on my stomach and my whole system. But it doesn't really it's not as good, I think."
416.0,Provider,Okay.
9145.0,Patient,"Yes, like I haven't felt as good since I switched over to it, which was. Like. I think I switched like five months ago for four or five months ago. Okay. So it was when I first moved."
416.0,Provider,"So definitely a first step, first and foremost, is to get you in to see tanya right as soon as possible for a MED evaluation and let her know that these changes have happened, I always get concerned about brain chemistry when I start to hear such a quick change. In things you know, in such a drastic change. So that's that definitely step one. yeah."
9145.0,Patient,"yeah and it's definitely like interfering with like, just like trying to do really basic shit like I don't feel like cooking like when I think about cooking I get like really overwhelmed. And like I used to like love cooking like I just like enjoy it as like a creative sort of activity and now i'm just like like I don't even want to cook I don't even want to eat like it's just like I don't even want to think about it."
416.0,Provider,i'm actually going to send a message to tanya while i'm talking to you if that's okay with you.
9145.0,Patient,yeah sure.
416.0,Provider,"Alright, I just said i'm either i'm in session with Rita Warner right now she's experiencing a significant increase in Depression and anxiety symptoms, to the extent that they're interfering with their sleep and impacting her desire to do basic things she enjoys. i'm working with her, but also asking her to make an appointment with you ASAP to review meds fyi so."
9145.0,Patient,Okay yeah.
416.0,Provider,So okay. What are you able to do that helps with your anxiety right now.
9145.0,Patient,um. Nothing really nothing really helps I think it's it's more like depression.
416.0,Provider,or.
9145.0,Patient,Probably like depression it doesn't feel. Like a anxiety like I don't feel like. Like my heart's not like racing I don't feel like that Gunilla weird energy today associated with anxiety it's more like I just. I feel like i'm like. Giving up like i'm like. yeah yeah.
416.0,Provider,"you're right I shouldn't have said anxiety it definitely sounds like. Definitely sounds more like depression, so what are you able to do anything that even if you aren't enjoying it the same way, you were before but are you doing any is there anything that you've done that gives you pleasure, right now, or helps you feel good."
9145.0,Patient,"um. Sometimes, like, if I can do, like a social activity. that'll usually help you know, like I like went for a walk with a friend around the lake lake merritt and I was like I felt an elevated mood. After that."
416.0,Provider,"Okay, so that's and that's a double whammy right because it's a walk and so it's movement and also social connection."
9145.0,Patient,yeah.
416.0,Provider,Anything else that you've been able to do.
9145.0,Patient,not really nothing else really. really helps.
416.0,Provider,So.
9145.0,Patient,"We like to do things like I like to like read and I was, I was like I don't even like reading I like like I wanted to just like get rid all my books like just like I should just put these in like a box or taking up all the space. yeah I haven't been doing martial arts, either for like the last like month and a half. That probably might have something to do with it, too, because I haven't been getting exercise."
416.0,Provider,"Oh that's huge yes, that will that will definitely impact it."
9145.0,Patient,yeah.
416.0,Provider,What what stopped you from doing the martial arts.
9145.0,Patient,"I was just too busy I need to find another another school to to train up because the one I was training at is is all the way in Albany. And, just like getting over there with traffic and everything at the end of the day it was just like too much. So i'm trying to i'm trying to find a school that's like either in alameda or like just through the tunnel in like downtown oakland or something. But that was like always. source of joy yeah I really enjoyed that. So not having that. has been I think is starting to starting to feel it."
416.0,Provider,mm hmm.
9145.0,Patient,"But like i've been like I wrote some emails i've been trying to like I took some steps, like last night, I visited a school in alameda so i've been kind of taking steps to get that back."
416.0,Provider,yeah.
9145.0,Patient,I think that well.
416.0,Provider,"So I think, can we make that a priority, because you need some some mood boosters in here. yeah right, you need some outlets and some mood boosters."
9145.0,Patient,"yeah I feel like my life is just like so like it's like drudgery. Like school is like so much and I don't really like my classes one of them's really hard this calculus class i'm taking is just like. feel like i'm just like getting my ass kicked and then it's like hurting my more i'll like i'm like man. Absolutely good smart but, like, I guess, though we're not as smart, as I thought I was. Like."
416.0,Provider,"I mean, if we look at the totality of everything that has gone on with you it's actually not that surprising that this is happening. mm hmm right you got dealt a big blow with the massage school thing. yeah you're struggling through classes, I know that money isn't easy for you, you miss your girlfriend or you have a challenging mother and father situation."
9145.0,Patient,yeah.
416.0,Provider,"I mean you've got a lot going on, and then we remove. The one of the things that kind of helps you stay grounded. The martial arts and you moved in there too. But."
9145.0,Patient,"yeah it's a lot, it is."
416.0,Provider,"yeah I mean when you put it all together it's like oh okay yeah I get that. Okay, I can see it."
9145.0,Patient,"So I think part of the problem is too is that I don't really have a lot of people around me like to like remind me of that. yeah to just be like God damn like you're going through it, you know, like it's not surprising, or just be like yeah that's a lot."
416.0,Provider,"yeah yeah. yeah and and if you're prone to depression anyway. uh huh yeah so it's gonna throw you over the edge, I see that."
9145.0,Patient,"yeah I just be like, am I going crazy, but actually there's like. Real like pretty tangible reasons why it would be feeling this way."
416.0,Provider,"Absolutely, so in a in a lot of ways you're having what is. An expected reaction to an abnormal situation."
9145.0,Patient,mm hmm.
416.0,Provider,"Right, just to kind of right size this. So."
9145.0,Patient,"I mean, do you think like. I mean cuz I did like think about my meds and stuff I was like maybe I need to see if I need to get on like a higher dosage or something. But like I don't even know if that's really. Like. The answer you know, like like sometimes I think if that's like it might be even kind of stopping me from. Dealing with what I need to deal with. or feeling what I need to like feel."
416.0,Provider,yeah and I don't think it will.
9145.0,Patient,mm hmm.
416.0,Provider,"I don't think it will, I think, because, so I would say no, I would say, I would say no, like, I would say, oh it's up to you, if it weren't interfering so much with your functioning. Right and your enjoyment of things that you normally enjoy. And if it weren't interfering with that, I would say, you know you have a lot more leeway, but because it is actually impacting your sleep and impacting your ability to connect to things that normally bring you joy. i'm way more concerned, and I would want to see about you know at least check in with tanya about it get get information from an expert. And I."
9145.0,Patient,"Should not ever give me. A void in during anything from like kind of like a therapeutic perspective, like. i'm not."
416.0,Provider,I think that it gives you it's the opposite actually and it gives you the ability to tolerate more difficult emotions and the clear mind to be able to process them.
9145.0,Patient,hmm.
416.0,Provider,"I mean you don't have to be miserable to be in therapy right. You can face hard emotions, with the help of your therapist without being like really, really miserable."
9145.0,Patient,Okay.
416.0,Provider,I mean ultimately it's your decision I would I would hope that you would at least get the information from her and you could have that discussion with her to.
9145.0,Patient,"yeah I mean, I would like to just be. More clear and like more functional, but I also want to like. I guess deal with the shit that I need to deal with. yeah you."
416.0,Provider,So. um. What do you think about seeing me a little more often until we can kind of get you over this hump.
9145.0,Patient,sure.
416.0,Provider,"Alright So what do you have available during the day, or in the morning, even early mornings are there, certain days I should look at or avoid."
9145.0,Patient,um I only have afternoons available Monday through Thursday. And then i'm a little bit more open on Fridays so. That.
416.0,Provider,We have on Friday.
9145.0,Patient,But I usually have a Tutoring appointment at 1050 on Fridays.

9145.0,Patient,"Oh, I work until three."
416.0,Provider,"Okay, what about three. or 315."

416.0,Provider,I could do 330 but then we'll only have a half an hour.
9145.0,Patient,"Well, I can see if I can get out a little bit early. yeah I can probably do 315."

9145.0,Patient,Okay.

Book more of those times to go for walks with friends stay connected okay. Have you had any suicidal thoughts or anything has it gotten that bad."
9145.0,Patient,"i'm not like. Realistic ones I guess more just like like what's the point sort of like that kind of feeling. More just like Oh, I wish I didn't have to do this, or like yeah. um but not like any serious like considerations are plans or anything yeah."
416.0,Provider,"Okay, if that changes I am reach out to me please and but if it's like more urgent. contact the suicide hotline do you know their number."
