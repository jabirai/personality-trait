The best. yeah make the best out of it yeah that's what I don't like. So I really don't like depending on people, because they don't know where to start and they're just more lost than I am so so. they're just weighing me down and. And shoot don't get done like it gets down when I do everything myself but it's weird but it's hard you know I mean. Trying to keep up with yourself and like your body's deteriorating. you're doing my biggest thing is to get into. That into that school."
