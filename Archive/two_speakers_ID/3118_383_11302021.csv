But i'm not around i'm worried about it my insurance not like being you know we're working out there. Because I want medical so it's you know got to be a California citizen, so I want to have insurance out there until I start work, which then takes 30 days. or become you know Colorado rest of them and then wait 90 days and get state insurance so i'm gonna have to figure out what to do, for that time."
383.0,Provider,"yeah well. I think you can maybe double check with breitbart health, to see if we, I mean we tend, we have. To national organization, so we may have therapists and you know, a group of Colorado group or a Midwest group that you can. transition to when it's time."
3118.0,Patient,"yeah I mean it's not right away, but going back no slowly."
383.0,Provider,yeah again it go out there and take a look at things first or.
3118.0,Patient,"i'm not totally sure I mean we're I mean yeah we live with my wife's grandparents and me we're kind of just tagging along with them, and so we you know get our own place out there, which is a lot cheaper than the bay area. And the bay area around it's just it's unreal. Right completely on the wearable. But yeah so we're kind of tagging along with them i'm not sure what they're going to do, I know that. we're going to they have a second House like a like a you know, a house up in the woods out and i'm your California. Well, which is like their cabin just a second House but. I have a feeling we're going to go there for a few months, because this helpful probably so within a week I mean House there is so you know, two, three days and. You know, then I get demolished and people build houses on top of that land for them. yeah so i'm gonna feel will go there and stay there for a few months, and then. You know, once my wife's grandfather quit his job or retired. Which is not sure whether he's going to create a retired yet yes. yeah I fly out there, like the House or something or just going to buy it going off of what the online pictures look like i'm not sure it could login date and they've they've never moved before they've never. You know I mean my wife's grandmother grew up in the south, and I was a kid so."
383.0,Provider,"Oh, really."
3118.0,Patient,"yeah it's been sending the family, for a long time. yeah it's sort of like for me, I mean like I moved, you know from Chicago Florida to Texas to Virginia West Virginia back. And then to California and backer with you and your Florida California again and yeah something i'm i'm used to move it around like. When I was with my parents, you know I mean we had social movers boxed up everything and they load the trucks up and drove our stuff and then we just met them there."
383.0,Provider,Right right.
3118.0,Patient,"Everything else so like. yeah I I kind of have a feeling like I mean, I know how to move better than like they do like the fact of like really small boxes like. So they need like a million boxes, you know just tons and tons of stuff to move their thing you're renting those pods but you got to find a company that delivers them in Colorado. But it will pick up in California, so that."
383.0,Provider,uh huh.
3118.0,Patient,"metal stuff so. that's. My father and while it kind of leaves the responsibility on my wife, she kind of has to do all that dictate everything in motion."
383.0,Provider,I think.
3118.0,Patient,"i'm it's it's been a rough time in the past month, like wi. fi you know that more. stressed out really."
383.0,Provider,"uh huh. What are you doing to help yourself kind of. decompress or you know find little moments of reprieve, do you have, how are you doing with taking care of yourself that way."
3118.0,Patient,"Today, with us, the first time, like it looks like in a month month and a half. I actually sat down like your private key deal and. Just close my eyes and focus on my breathing. But you know warm they're coming into my nose quarter alpha now and actually it didn't open it, you know calm down. You know, worked a lot better than I thought. You know I mean that but other than that i've been given anything think kind of going down no i'm my thoughts about using i've been going up. Like I don't know why yeah I don't know why i'm having like dreams so like using like i'll wake up like you know, like search and like like my door like ways to keep everything not. Just it's. Not I thought that was over with."
383.0,Provider,"uh huh well it's a bump in the road, as they say. And do you think it might have to do with lights like that, when the holidays are around it's a little bit you know more stressful or a lot more stressful can be for some people um. Just the energy of the holidays is kind of more frantic and then people sometimes are more emotionally involved there and Paul yeah."
3118.0,Patient,"The me I. Think it's definitely you know player troll. You know, an old thing. You know, like my is there's a lot of people live here and there, the more people coming for Christmas nice thing for two weeks. So it's streaming for house and i'm looking forward to that."
383.0,Provider,But some people are coming to your House there and. uh huh yeah who was coming.
3118.0,Patient,My wife's uncle and. My mother in law's first of them it's a really weird like this and it's really. weird.
383.0,Provider,Okay.
3118.0,Patient,Not traditional about. That oh.
383.0,Provider,I see. yeah well. Just everybody people coming together to to just celebrate or is that.
3118.0,Patient,"yeah but it's just you know there's like this animosity between my father in law and my wife's uncle. You know cuz he over money like you know, like 20 years ago he won $50,000 and. Are on boats and every paper back just kind of screwed him over on it so he's, just like in every sense I mean like you know he. makes it very known that like he. doesn't want you know my wife's uncle here like you can they thought welcome, and so I just like everything's kind of tense."
383.0,Provider,Right right.
3118.0,Patient,"And then you know, like like my mother in law, she you know she drinks, a lot more when her first husband, you know when like you know he comes over like because he just drinks all day. And if someone for her to drink with so she dreams, you know why all day she'll be sloppy drunk by the end of the day, and since it's so like it's so annoying I mean I absolutely cannot stand alcoholics and I know i'm not my problem but alcohol. I just. like a hot spot for alcoholics I guess probably my dad is but. The TV lot so it's so annoying. But and then like there was a way to you know get away it's go to my room, which is. My wife and I share a room with our son so there's just no like there's no break."
383.0,Provider,"Right right. Is there. A place, you can walk to or walk there's there is there a path like even just walking you know just going out for a walk I mean I know we've talked about this before, but are you are you in a neighborhood that where you feel comfortable taking a walk."
3118.0,Patient,"yeah um we actually went on a walk to the event. Unfortunately, my son got her yet drug by the dog the dog and she saw score on took off and drugged him straight, though. So yeah it's even even walks like you know are hard to go on, because if I am I told my wife, like, I want to go by myself, she gets like super you know, like self conscious thinking that like he or she did something like you know. Like i'm mad at her so with her like something's wrong with her. right away from. And like she was just like really understand like I just like need my own. time you know, like. For a little bit yeah. Definitely us he goes he goes to work, you know eight to five but come to my lunch break and texting all day long on stuff that's just like. When it comes home at the end and I did nothing to talk about because we've been talking all day long. yeah it's just it's been stressful."
383.0,Provider,"yeah well, maybe there's some ways, you know, think about like. Some communication strategies that you can use to kind of just let your wife know. I mean your particular situation that you may need some time just a little like a half an hour when she gets home from work just to go outside and be you know, on your own. And it's not to do anything with her you just need Maybe you can you can blame it on me, you can say your therapist is encouraging you to go and just taking some time just on your own you know just to kind of re Center yourself and. You know. I just think that everybody needs a little bit of time, apart from their you know their routine their loved ones. Just yourself, you know not to be using definitely you know not to be you know kind of you don't want to flame that fire, but you wanted to find peace yourself with yourself."
3118.0,Patient,"yeah I. Probably work, work that one out but. i'm going to sign on she will take it well, like the amount of what. I mean."
383.0,Provider,"Even if you said, like maybe, just like three times a week or like once on the weekend and twice during the week or something that you just take a little walk and and it's not about it's not about to shoot worry you're gonna you're going to try and get a score some dope or something."
3118.0,Patient,"A little bit of that. say I really can't blame for like her stress, like me, leaving because you know eight out of 10 times like I love you know, on my own and send it a bad and. You know, end up in jail or the hospital from an overdose and. under the bed me and now it's 16 times i've over those cheeks found my 15 of them and. You know it's just the most own generation tend to call 911 keep smoking itself, which you know. So sometimes just kind of like. I just really traumatized but."
383.0,Provider,yeah sure.
3118.0,Patient,"You know, when I when a when a rain we text me like actually gets uncomfortable and because she thinks it's. Some folks from."
383.0,Provider,Right right.
3118.0,Patient,away so.
383.0,Provider,yeah do you have a spot outside where you can go and sit and kind of just have your own place where you can in the backyard or something.
3118.0,Patient,"Oh, probably better man, I can only. do so."
383.0,Provider,"And maybe. You can mention that you have some. relaxation, you know things that you. You know that you're working on just to calm your nervous system down, you know, because when you're agitated when you're annoyed when you're. You know, worked up stressed, you know what what's the remedy, you know I don't know where you're at with the xanax and, as she was wanting to tight right you off of that."
3118.0,Patient,"i'm a little worried about that i'm not too worried about switching over to call them. Further pretty much the same. But i'm just kind of worried about like things like you know onset. To them actually. Say was the first time, going gaping one kilogram open sex and I actually sat there and I read through. Okay i'm going to add my wife told me to do that, who wants you to take you know gathering if it says take one tablet today and I told her, I was like you know, I have to, I have to stop faking what scott's going to get cut off, so I have to. Martin not rely on. So, and then I don't know I think bath maybe play a little wrong. stressful so all."
383.0,Provider,Right sure.
3118.0,Patient,"About that the back of my mind. I mean i've. had to seizures from Spencer withdrawal. it's I know it's always in the background line like anytime I feel like i'm going to have a theory like i'll. Go take like you know, like a milligram of xanax or something, and you know it will call me down but it's. I mean I don't know I guess like i'm I know not every time I feel like i'm gonna have a seizure i'm going to but I. need to like at least like stop relying on that medicine to calm me down."
383.0,Provider,"Right right so, then what. Typically, is. You know what your body is wanting or needing a body mind is to find a way like you were saying to calm yourself down and that starts as a practice, you know it's like. Time that you give yourself to. relax. Excuse me, so you know I want to wait till you get to the medication start you know tasha tell says i'm only going to be prescribing this now, you know it's like you want to start that now."
3118.0,Patient,"i'm going to after if I can just switch over to like someone to know that extended release planning slips know them in certain ways. which I asked her if I can switch over to over implement and since that so they go long longer active work and then you know, maybe that'll work or you take two a day I don't know something or just add new like value through panic attacks, because I don't think either at the demos. yeah work so."
383.0,Provider,"I brings up the panic attacks, for you what starts coming up for you, when you start getting space."
3118.0,Patient,"or anytime like our life, you know my body twitches like ever since my last year I got. Like I like Twitter a lot it's it's weird and then, when I have dateline that's a while, like all start twitching a lot more, and you know you feel bad what leads up to the teacher and oh that's what happened last time. yeah it was like the whole day I I felt off and, like, I said to know what's wrong with him. And I was really twitchy all day and and then I was walking outside of the car I fell to the ground and my wife's like okay we're going to hospital yeah she thought that note that the seizure she looked at me tell them what's wrong."
383.0,Provider,When was this when was.
3118.0,Patient,"This last May last year. And when I write as they're getting ready to check me and my end of the chairs, I had a grand mal seizures I woke up in the hospital yeah like my hand side of the bed he goes, you know, I guess, I was fighting the nurses like clouds unconscious. You know, and that in they come in hospital for three days and I checked myself out and. I went home and like I pretty much was like a vegetable I just laying in bed for a week and. It was really weird I mean I kept having many Caesars like you know, like if I you know things on TV or too flashy and coffee and you see here. yeah I couldn't speak and it just it suck to roll like you know I I didn't know if I come back. My wife didn't know if i'll. ever be normal again and. it's just like it scared and I don't know I don't think my body to like handle another one."
383.0,Provider,"Right right. Well, and so, so what happens is you start to get scared that you're going to have another one."
3118.0,Patient,"yeah and then that once as soon as a thought insurance like you know i'll try to. You know i'll try to like dismiss it and think of something else, but just like those powers over thing, and you know, like my inviting gets worse because i'm having anxiety and then. Right it's like I know I have listened to stop it i'm trying not to take it so then i'm having anxiety like should I take it, it says the point where I need to take it, you know I just thought all. Right I haven't I have an appointment with don't. Tell so i'm going to scale so thorough like what I should do to Patrick down."
383.0,Provider,yeah.
3118.0,Patient,"i've been i've been taking for. Long prescribed now for a year, but you know for good two years before but i'll say."
383.0,Provider,It taking taking the sonics.
3118.0,Patient,know that another fencer yeah.
383.0,Provider,"yeah um. well. You want to work really hard i'm going to talk about this in group, but you know to to relax to learn how to relax is it's a study it's not just like Oh, let me just take a couple of breaths it's it's it's a it's an endeavor really and we have to to explore it and work on it and. You know, make it a project."
3118.0,Patient,"You know who says a hard time. You know it's like I don't see him a lot today, I was thinking about like trying to like meditate and i've always had a hard time with keeping my mind still and. You know, like when I you know i'm going to get started with our own intellect take it one one is still like I don't I try not to take it at that was fun I don't have to do for the day. I don't like the resumes they do. You know, so I mean if I don't take it it's like it's part one minds like. Like shut down like states, though I really wish like I could do that just focus on, you know myself."
383.0,Provider,"Right, but it is it's like it's not just it doesn't come naturally to most people it's something that you work on it's something it's like. Our mind is like an unruly you know pet or an unruly child, you know that needs to be reminded gently and with firmness, you know know we're going to focus on this now, you know and the deep breathing really helps a lot, but you know I can talk about it more and teach more. But, but I would like you to continue every day if you can do just like two minutes of you know, deep breathing and trying to focus. and concentrate your mind just on that experience of breathing that's all you know, and if your mind wanders because getting control of the mind is, it is a muscle, you know I mean it's a different kind of muscle but it's. You know people that have mental control meaning like let's say they're archers you know they can do a bow and arrow and they have to concentrate concentration is something that can be developed. it's not something that just goes naturally without some people having some people don't I mean it's something that can be developed so. You can work on your on this this project of learning how to get control of your mind and also control of your emotions of fear, you know and panic. And you know the medicine is there as an assist but you also want to be working on that. too."
3118.0,Patient,I need boys like stop beating myself up I guess every day. blocks. We also we got a new puppy also.
383.0,Provider,"Oh, you did."
3118.0,Patient,"yeah and it's a small dog that i'm not really a huge fan of but she's in love with him so she followed me everywhere. ID and I go back it's like I mean I don't give a little bit she wants, and I mean I let it sit in my lap everything so that one like it's almost like to take that are yeah. Please take her way excuse just. Maybe it's good insight, you know I still need smile going."
383.0,Provider,"uh huh can you start to work on bonding with this dog, do you think."
3118.0,Patient,"yeah i'm. Good i'm just being resilient. Know maybe we could we could guess I haven't really gone open right, you know the day my other dog is so sudden. it's like them and then shoes he kept me alive in my 20s but for sure."
383.0,Provider,"that's your your dog that you have, for many, for a long time that was your dog. yeah yeah. Well, bit by bit, see if you can build a little relationship with this new little dog maybe he will bring you comfort or she is a she or he. She what's her name. Watson Boston and I think you name some picked it up oh that's a really cute name. Is your is your son enjoying the dog."
3118.0,Patient,"Yes, but she's a little hyper for him she's probably since he likes to you know fight everything and. He got small and so in our key part and so like i'll play with those vitamins they start getting kicked her out there on your bed. Okay she's already she's pretty. Good already she doesn't go to the bathroom inside she wakes us up and what's not have to go outside, but she won't use the doggie door to door open my crack. uh huh she's smiling so. Much."
383.0,Provider,"Well that's sweet that you have a new little animal but that's also something you can focus on to you know to just connect with, and we can maybe talk about your your your loss of your other dog. And you know, an appointment, maybe, if you want to process a little bit more about that. yeah. Okay well let's schedule your next appointments for December. So two weeks would be the 13th and the 27. that's a Monday and what time works for you. I think we had in 1030 in the morning. i'm fine I mean."
3118.0,Patient,"yeah actually 1030 we've worked pretty well. Because I didn't take my sister a lot of work everything out and she really works at 10 or 1030 so I can have my point with you, thank you take her at work."
383.0,Provider,"Okay, so it's 1030 December 13th and let me look at. The 27th. I had that open also 1030 December, the 27th. So do you feel pretty solid and resisting they are just that you have."
3118.0,Patient,"yeah um yeah I mean, mainly because I don't have any local connects. You know, have to go up to the city of San Francisco that. You know that takes a risk of getting busted and. You know, getting shot or stabbed a bear because it's pretty things in the tenderloin and. You know, unfortunately, the people they know me pretty well. And even if, like I haven't been there for a couple years people still recognize me when I come back, though. But yeah I mean if I went up there, like you know my wife would know that would probably be it, I mean it's kind of like on the last leg. me relaxing and you know user and she'd like I said she's found when you know at least 1415 times I photos and some phone she said she didn't think that marketing was no work so young black and blue already."
383.0,Provider,"well. So um. I don't know what you can do to just affirm very strongly, maybe it's when you're in the shower or something like that I affirm that I, my recovery matters to me it matters to me. I have invested in my recovery I want it and going for i'm going after it i'm going to continue i'm not i'm going to continue on this path. it's like you're in that forest that you described still walking out of it you're still walking out, you know it's you're kind of going coming to a shaky bridge and. You still walking out, but you know we have that's when you have to re re determined to yourself determination, I am God getting to the other side and i'm not gonna let this shaky bridge, you know mess with my recovery I want this."

And then the second thing is, you know see if you can bond with this dog and use dog is kind of like you know to to teach the dog and and provide some guidance to it to help it. and Then also we discussed, you know, reinforcing your determination that you're going to your your your recovery is important to you and important your life is important to you yeah yeah."
