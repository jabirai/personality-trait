16694.0,Patient,hi.
759.0,Provider,How are you in the ND waiting room i'm so sorry I just looked I just saw that you popped up but I didn't. get a notification that you had checked in.
16694.0,Patient,Within like maybe five to 10 minutes.
759.0,Provider,i'm so sorry about that.
16694.0,Patient,No worries.
759.0,Provider,How you been.
16694.0,Patient,"whoa i've been really waiting for this therapy session for quite some time, you know it's been a while, since you and I last talked."
759.0,Provider,We had.
16694.0,Patient,"My initial so um you know it's just been very rollercoaster of emotions, a lot of things have happened. Just. I things that I can't control i'm trying to learn that I can't control certain things that are going on, I kind of just have to let go and let God so i'm trying to be positive. A lot of things that caused a lot of anxiety within myself. A lot of panic attacks that I just can't control them and I go really anxious and then I start being impulsive so I want to be able to learn how to not be so impulsive."
759.0,Provider,yeah so. what's some of the things impulsive things that you have been doing lately.
16694.0,Patient,"i'm calling my X non stop because he doesn't answer certain questions that I have and he's just being very standoffish. Just not understanding with what i'm going through. He i've found out some stuff that makes me very upset that from not not they're not confirmed. But things come up to like a conclusion about like Oh, maybe you're trying to get back with your the mother of your children or something. And that makes me feel impulsive when I have no control or have no knowledge so i'm in the unknown so that makes me become very impulsive and I, you know call until the answers. Or you know, like me, as we blocked all calm and private and he doesn't answer until he find all the answers and then. We begin to are you because he gets frustrated and I get frustrated so that's just been one of the biggest impulsive things that i've been doing, but this past weekend I actually was very occupied with other things so that made me less impulsive but I noticed that. When I do not occupy myself I become impulsive."
759.0,Provider,"You become impulsive when you don't. find yourself. yeah right. And what's seven days Okay, so what it sounds like it's that you have like your your ex partner right who's not like answering your phone calls, which can be frustrating right. You know you will just want to keep on calling until you get answer. One answer on certain things that you need to get answer on, and I think that's understandable because, like if you need to get Ahold of him it's hard when someone is ignoring you ignoring your phone calls."
16694.0,Patient,You right you.
759.0,Provider,"can't control what other people do, but you can control what your reaction is and how you decide to react to it, you know so. Instead of calling him and calling him just sending one phone call or a couple phone calls and just texting and just you know, knowing that if you truly wants to get a hold of you, he can and well. yeah. So he says. Sometimes it's you know when we were in that frustration mode and we're not getting what we want, we just tend to kind of want to push and push and push. Until we get an answer, but sometimes it's Okay, just to be reassured of you know, like I reached out to him if he doesn't like get back to me there's nothing you know I can I can't make him get back to me I just know that I reached out to him, I did my part you know. That might help, but when you're in that impulsive mode it's kind of hard to regulate your emotions right. Because you're right just angry, it sounds like you're just angry, you know, because this person should you know acknowledge, you and your you know basically wanting to be knowledge right. Yes, yeah. So you mentioned something else, but I totally forgot i'm. In between that."
16694.0,Patient,"He mentioned all that I found out some stuff that I came to conclusions are like. yeah is the mother of his child children was in jail and I found out she's out of jail, so my first reaction was. Oh he's out there visiting her in Mexico or something and he's getting back with her, so I made that conclusion up because you know, like, I saw that she's out and now she's posting about her children and I went on our Facebook page. And I saw all of that. And I confronted him I said, can you just tell me about what you're doing so I can move forward. And he doesn't want to respond to me so he doesn't need to explain his personal life to me anymore, and he said think whatever you want my conscience is clear i'm not going to tell you, the more you asked me, the less i'm going to tell you."
759.0,Provider,"The last time to tell you okay. Okay. yeah that's hard you know, like you want him to be open and honest with you and the fact that he won't do that you know that's hard."
16694.0,Patient,yeah very highly frustrating just thinking about it right now. makes me upset.
759.0,Provider,"yeah yeah because you want that open communication like you guys, are no longer together."
16694.0,Patient,"Just just say it, you know, like be on us. But he doesn't want the same thing to me."
759.0,Provider,"yeah. it's hard, because you guys just recently broke up right. Right yeah it hasn't been too long, since you guys, you know broke up yeah. yeah. Okay, and you know, like i'm sorry that you're sad because of dad you know, like it's okay to select your emotions as a yard like if you're angry. it's okay to be angry if you're sad it's okay to be sad, you know and not to try to push those emotions away. But there's ways that you can learn to regulate your emotions that you're not you don't feel like you're being impulsive or you feel like you're you know letting your emotions control you does that make sense. Yes, yeah yeah because you're very much are in control of your reactions, you know and how you react to other people, yes, and how you react to your partner it's especially."
16694.0,Patient,yeah.
759.0,Provider,"In terms of dad you know sounds like it's been ups and downs, and you moved recently right. Yes, and have you been feeling kind of low depressed or anxious."
16694.0,Patient,"or both i've been feeling both. You feeling i've been trying to. yeah i've been trying to feel less of that. mm hmm, but I feel those moments, where I get really low and I just want to sleep and then there's moments where like I just can't get out of my sadness. And this hurts so much. Yes, I don't want to be like that anymore. I wish I had like magic powers to just get this feeling away and say I don't need to feel, I do not need to feel love for him."
759.0,Provider,"And that's going to come with time you like you promise to always love him at some you know some level, you know guys don't come with time we you don't feel as much as you currently do for him. Right yeah. i'm probably not telling you anything new things that you probably are we know."
16694.0,Patient,"You know, but yeah."
759.0,Provider,"You reminder sometimes remind yourself, you know. Right yeah yeah."
16694.0,Patient,"Well, actually um. I I go to church right and we we were at one point talking saying that you know let's have a therapy session together, you know, as you know, and he was we were in a good state, we had already you know tried to be for this even happened with this baby mama coming on john stuff. And he had agreed to it. We actually today at seven two of our pastors from the church that I attend are going to do a zoom call between the two of us and them too, and at first, he was all about it. and He was all about it, and today, when I told him hey it's at seven they're going to send us a link and i'll forward it over to you. And he's our warm up talking to anyone, and they said, well then what's the point of view, saying you're going to join. If now you're saying no and said how are you rejecting something that's in god's work, you know god's doing this for us, you know, providing these pastors to take time out of their day to speak to both of us. And I said it's. it's to have peace within you and myself, so that we're not always constantly fighting using the lord's word. In order for us to grow forward. So we're supposed to have that at 7pm i'm you know, praying that he does join I sent him the link I call them hey did you receive it, yes, I did or said okay see you there at seven. And home, hoping that that just. bring some clarity to everything that's going on with us because i've been praying and hoping and a lot of people are like, why are you so stuck in this hope. That he will eventually see it, I said, because I believe guys on God is probably putting us to a test with this situation to be better within ourselves and be better in the relationship so. i'm hopeful, in that sense, and if it's just a closure thing then at the closure thing I just rather him be honest about things. And i'm just trying to be in a positive state in order to jump into this call, and just you know, let God do his work and hopefully it's a positive thing and not a negative one, you know we're not going to let the enemy come in between it, you know so i'm just being hopeful."
759.0,Provider,"that's good i'm glad that you're being hopeful like and i'm like you said if it's you know something that's god's going to do to bring you guys back together, maybe it's going to be a closure thing at least such you have more peace of mind about that."
16694.0,Patient,"You know, yes."
759.0,Provider,"Like you know what it is moving forward. Yes, yeah and I think rely on your faith is a strange, you know that she have to rely on your things. yeah."
16694.0,Patient,Yes.
759.0,Provider,Why do you remind me why did break up happen.
16694.0,Patient,"So breakup happened because we had a lot of problems within the relationship, I did I was pregnant, I had a very high risk pregnancy, so my nerves were always crazy my hormones as well. And we ended up having a stillbirth full term so. You know, we lost a baby four and a half months ago, not one half four months ago now. it's going to be four months. into more gays and yeah."
759.0,Provider,yeah so guys.
16694.0,Patient,"we've been through a lot exactly we've been through a lot and I just want peace, you know within myself, and I know that he doesn't understand. That my painting is more stronger than his because i'm the one that's going through. The motion, and not only that like he doesn't understand that whether I looked okay or acted Okay, does it mean I was doing okay with it myself. after losing our baby, so he doesn't understand the level of pain and, yes, right now, we've had a lot of conflicts between our son. And a lot of fighting and a lot of you know, and I told him, but my reactions are based are because of your actions that you've done. The things that you have done, have triggered me to act, a certain way, which I don't want to you have. The power to not make me feel this way, and he doesn't understand what a person with postpartum depression feels he doesn't know what a person with anxiety feel like I have anxiety, I have depression. All at the same time and it's. hurtful that he doesn't understand what i'm feeling because of the loss of our child. And and and it's not okay that he this mindset of too many problems I don't want to be with you anymore, instead of saying, let me be your support, because we lost a child together it's not like that child was only mine."
759.0,Provider,that's true yeah.
16694.0,Patient,"that's what's hard for me, because he can't seem to understand that and i'm hoping that, with the session that we're going to have today he gets to understand a little bit more of what i'm going through."
759.0,Provider,"yeah. And it's like you said it's not easy being being having postpartum depression it's not easy, having now the top of losing a child. Exactly you know that's a very hard thing to go through you know by emotional you know, like it makes it, I mean I can't imagine how you feel I can only just you know know that you probably feel you know horrible and you know about. Why."
16694.0,Patient,"And right and then on top of that losing our relationship, at the same time. yeah his excuse was you always kicked me out, I always told you, the things so that you could understand how i'm feeling, you know I would tell you why do you act this way with me like if you don't want to be with me, then why are you here if it bothers you. Then, who I am and what i'm going through like you don't understand and he would be absorbed set all the time, and he wouldn't even. bother to talk to me about how are you feeling like are you is the baby's thing that still affecting are you dealing with postpartum what is it that you're going through, we need to figure something out, but he was easy to just walk away. And I understand his reasoning to say oh I don't want that environment for my children, and again I get that but you also are leaving me behind and down in the ground without even turning back to say Okay, let me understand you let me understand where you're going through. mm hmm and that's because I would understand if he was going through the same thing I would understand it, I would say hey were you out because we share the last number."
759.0,Provider,yeah you turn last together yeah.
16694.0,Patient,She was.
759.0,Provider,yeah.
16694.0,Patient,"And that's what's hurting me the most, you know that we shared a child and we shared a loss. And i'm dealing with it on my own. that's what hurts me the most."
759.0,Provider,And there's no easy way to fill.
16694.0,Patient,Right.
759.0,Provider,"You know and less as your partner, you know, he should be more reassuring and be basically been there for you as a support system for you."
16694.0,Patient,Right.
759.0,Provider,And it's hard when you don't receive that support.
16694.0,Patient,Right.
759.0,Provider,"yeah. You know, all I can tell you is that you know you're still here you're still trying to you know deal with the aftermath of losing a child and losing apart from you know not no longer being in a relationship and that's probably hard to you know all those names are like. And sometimes you know, like. Having both of those things happen to add between you know minds, you know, like without you having time to heal from your child, you know that is significant to."
16694.0,Patient,"US hoping is like So do I, does that mean, I have to forcefully be with you and I said no, but how can you not use. Your reasoning, to see what you're doing in the pain you're inflicting by being the way that you are, and I think the way that you are instead of saying. Let me sit down and really understand what she's going through the motions or she's going through. doesn't mean i'm saying come back home today i'm saying, think about it reassess reassess the situation. And me and based on your assessment of now understanding having knowledge of what i'm going through every assess the situation and say is really the decision that I want. For the rest of my life to say, this is it, and if this is the right decision for the rest of your life, then let's close this chapter together and say you want about your life and I go about my life, but in the moment there's no closure because. You keep me in the unknown."
759.0,Provider,"yeah yeah. yeah him i'm willing to talk to you and talk it out, and I think having a mediator tonight, yes tonight right you guys are so often, I think that will go a long way to have someone in between both of you, you know spiritual."
16694.0,Patient,"And even young who don't they don't know me personally, I don't know him personally so it's. Completely no it's not one sided. Because you know they're going to hear both of our sites."
759.0,Provider,"yeah I think that would be really good you know, and I hope he does show up you know he'll."
16694.0,Patient,"I hope so too, I hope that you know i'm going to pray that he does. Right after our call when you pray that he shows up and that you know God, you know gives him, you know, like the strength and doesn't allow and God protects them and doesn't allow the enemy to come in between and him not wanting to participate when they're speaking. or asking questions because he had already said right now prior to me. sending him the link he's like well i'm not gonna i'm not gonna talk. If they're going to be talking to me. i'm like so you're rejecting god's work, you know God is putting all of this together for us so you're not going to accept it so i'm not i'm not doing that I said well that's what you're saying. they're going to talk to you about. You know, having peace within both of us we don't need to be arguing and bickering that's not something God wants us to be doing like we're not following his path or not following this word. we're bickering with one another, and you know we just can't be this way anymore we're constantly fighting we're constantly arguing it doesn't make sense."
759.0,Provider,"yeah it doesn't make sense. yeah. yeah you know, like, I hope that reassurance comes quickly for you, you know, in terms of where he's at so you know for yourself and hopefully that will bring some peace to the situation yeah. yeah. let's talk about you know ways that you can find have helping kind of like coping through what you're going through you know, like. What do you like to do I know we talked about your hobbies and our first session, but why should go to like coping skill or thing that you do to help you."
16694.0,Patient,"Honestly, I haven't really been doing much to cope with it, I just have literally just sat in my sorrow and just cried it out and. lay down, and you know just close my eyes and I just felt the pain, you know but. You know I could. I could use something to to cope, I mean I just haven't really put work into it, I, and I know that that's kind of wrong and should find something because it's better than nothing, you know it's doing something to actually make it feel better. You know. I mean, I want to do like not like I mentioned last time I want to be able to buy pete and maybe paint. Something or maybe journals and stuff you know write it down. I don't know i'm just go for a walk or something is just like I get so anxious I get really anxious like. I try not to get into but I can't like I started to shake. The anxieties to my check I can control, my thoughts like I could. Just constantly being and thinking overthinking overthinking I don't want to do that anymore."
759.0,Provider,yeah. I need you currently taking medication for anxiety. Do you want to take medication. Every active this position here I by heart health.
16694.0,Patient,"I talked to. I talked to I can I can remember Toronto sun tell. Okay yeah, let me tell you the name i'm going to grab my backpack really quick, I have the medication they had prescribed. Okay, and then i'll let you know that I only took it for four days, but it would give me more anxiety."
759.0,Provider,yeah. Okay hold on.
16694.0,Patient,"hold on, let me just grab it really. have it here somewhere. lexapro."
759.0,Provider,Oh lexapro okay.
16694.0,Patient,yeah that really made me feel. yeah.
759.0,Provider,"Well i'm going to do i'm gonna reach out to the care navigators and trying to have them go to give you a time to meet with chantel. And let her know that that makes you more anxious and be talking about different medical. IP about the help okay. I think that you know, like I I mentioned medication, because I just want to make sure you know, like. If you're taking a difference, you know actually helping or not another thing you can do with anxiety and depression. is a practice called mindfulness and the simple you know, in terms of staying in the moment as it comes up like, and I think journaling will help you, you know, also in this practice. Just journaling kind of like your feelings and your emotions and it can be, I feel this way today because or why do I feel this way. To be. Staying in the moment it's just basically noticing your thoughts, you know as for you, you know, like your emotions, as they come up for you. and accepting your emotions, as they do come up like today, I feel sad. Today I feel really sad, you know i'm thinking about my last child and just give me an example and i'm thinking about. My relationship, you know, let me know about this, let me just express myself through writing and just let me just accept my emotions, as they come up. You know, like there's no way to know right way to fill me know in terms that you know my i'm you know so okay to be sad it's okay to be. You know by feel anger any emotion that's coming up for you and just to do deep breathing exercises to hit that helps regulate your you know emotions to. regulate kind of like your nervous system kind of calms you down a little bit. The deep breathing exercises is just inhaling you know and holding your breath for three to five seconds exhaling and just re on repeat and just being you that yeah so. I want you to look up mindfulness you know there's so many different practices and so many different techniques that mindfulness helps. And if you're a YouTube watcher if you go on YouTube and just put in mindfulness a lot of different things are going to pop up. And you just learn the next couple weeks, I want you just to learn, but that concept is and see if it can help. You know somebody can do added to because medication is one tool to help you for your fear anxiety therapy and having a coping skills and other tools that you can add but I don't want you feeling too anxious, because I know that's an uncomfortable feeling."
16694.0,Patient,"You know feeling, it really is."
759.0,Provider,yeah.
16694.0,Patient,"So I get really, really anxious like my body starts to shake my like I feel like i'm going crazy like I feel like i'm going crazy and I start to like think of like, how can I get a manager what am I going to do, like this, like that, and like it's just my mind just starts to. go over and over and over and over and it's like I don't want to feel that way anymore I, who I really do not feel I cannot feel this way anymore. yeah and and it's just killing me inside i'm killing myself. By thinking so much and it's like. I can't beat this way makes me lose my lose my myself and makes me lose myself and makes me lose focus at work and makes me not feel motivated makes me feel down and defeat it."
759.0,Provider,"yeah yeah. yeah and that's hard plus you know, like you know when you feel as though, like your thoughts are here, dare you can't you know just can you know focus in on the moment. And you know, like you're basically paying attention to you know what's going to happen, or what should happen, and why did this happen and gain loss and not kind of like jumbled like or jungle in your mind with thoughts, you know that can be really. So you know if I suppose the actually what are you doing right now."
16694.0,Patient,I am sitting in my car. i'm speaking to you. i'm expressing my feelings on what i'm going through. uh huh i'm. Trying to help myself.
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16694.0,Patient,and find myself in this situation.
759.0,Provider,"mm hmm Okay, that was a little bit of a mindfulness exercise. My you got your attention back to the present moment i'm not thinking about this dad i'm just paying attention to what i'm doing right now and just shifting a little bit of a chef. You know, in your mind okay what am I doing right now Okay, this is what i'm doing and bring your awareness back to the present moment today here and the now. that's that."
16694.0,Patient,"yeah and that's that's funny that you mentioned that because I so so subconsciously that that once. I was arguing with him arguing and arguing and arguing, and now you say wait a minute like I stopped myself."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16694.0,Patient,"And I said what am I doing to myself. And I literally like. stopped and said well TIM i'm not going to continue to argue with him. And I just. Like I I literally like stop myself, and I said no i'm not gonna let this emotion that the rest of me and I stopped and I kind of just like like you said guys snap myself back into reality and said you're not going to be fighting over something that is worthless right now, like. I might love you but you're not worth anything to me right now, because you're causing more pain in my life, instead of thinking and analyzing and saying hey she's worth something you're making me feel worthless. So i'm feeling worthless you're worthless to me in the moment you know you're not being somebody that's being supportive you're showing me you care. you're showing me you don't care. So that's what I snapped myself into that reality and said move forward, because all you're doing is hurting yourself, so I told myself that so I did kind of like do that. And you know subconsciously without even knowing that's a coping skill, I never even thought of it that way."
759.0,Provider,"yeah yeah. So I want you to start your practice job and hopefully come routine you know, for you to do you know. Like okay i'm not going to think of this let my mind just wander i'm going to bring it back to when i'm doing in this present moment. I mean you know have intentions are related to the present moment like what, what can I do right now to kind of make myself feel. Better you know, like in terms of like my mental health care, you know, like in turn terms of my mental health like. What can I do like even if it's doing something in relation to like self care, you know what can I do for myself. Or if you're at work, you know, like let me focus in on work, because I know this distraction sometimes helps you know. In terms of you know me just focusing in on what i'm doing right here at work or if you're home, you know, thinking of things that you know, bring you joy. You know, to cultivate joy to like if I know that taking a walk helps if I know that. I need to go and get maybe some paints, or maybe a coloring book or you know just something artistic to do. I wanted to think of ways, and this doesn't come easy to like i'm giving you a lot of pointers but i'm not going to give you too many I don't want you to leave here like you know by."
16694.0,Patient,Her one.
759.0,Provider,"You know, but I want you to i'm planting the seed that's what i'm doing I. i'm planting the seed and in terms of how the help you, you know, like in terms of you being able to regulate your emotions just a little bit better, but what I want you to do. is to focus in on journaling for the next couple weeks and I want you to also focus in on mindfulness just staying present in the moment and doing speaking exercises to OK. OK."
16694.0,Patient,Those three years they. Do you think that every other week is it's good for.
759.0,Provider,"The sessions, I would like to see. You like if we do weekly do would be 30 minute sessions and the minute sessions, but we can always sit you to weekly if you feel like that might you know doing."
16694.0,Patient,"I think it would be better. yeah I think it would be better 30 minute. weekly sessions. Okay, I feel I literally was. You know, I was really looking forward to a session with you last Monday, and I understand that you were you had to cancel out similar."
759.0,Provider,yeah that's true i'm sorry about that yeah.
16694.0,Patient,"No, no, no, no, no."
759.0,Provider,i'm so sorry yeah like I had to be skeptical because I wasn't feeling well. I did read that you were on that schedule.
16694.0,Patient,"You know, I was so. This was the earliest one man, I could I mean they were going to schedule me, for the first, but. I work I took over a property, so I needed to be part and present and I wasn't going to have time because they had only a date a day schedule for it, so I say I can't so I mean if we could do weekly and we like we could do weekly I would totally be up for it. And it would work for me, because I think I just checking in more. would be a better thing for me."
759.0,Provider,"Okay, I totally get that and understand you know, like you're going through a tough time and you know. The support that you can get you know if it's there for you definitely take advantage of that yeah."
16694.0,Patient,Right right so that's why i'm training like. Better for me to just do weekly. i'm for now.
759.0,Provider,doing a long time yeah.
16694.0,Patient,i'm coming along title at things can happen within a week um you know sorry just rather just do we can for now.
759.0,Provider,"yeah yeah yeah that sounds good. All right, we still have some about 10 more minutes left. I want you to tell me of a time where you felt good about life, you know Dean through going Okay, and what that looks like like I know it's hard to imagine aren't getting back to time, but I want you to think about things that you were doing, and maybe there were some happy moment."
16694.0,Patient,"Before my relationship with when I had my life together, you know it was traveling the world, not the world but I, you know, I was doing things like that to feed myself with happiness, you know I got to experience and meet a lot of people and and I was you know happy carefree me, you know. I. kind of lost myself in my relationship in the sense, where I took on too much responsibility, but during that time, that I was without owning I. You know I would work I would you know go home I would do my exercises I would you know just take care of myself and I would go out with my friends and. Life is great like I feel like I had a grasp on my life I was doing amazing at work i'm. Just a lot of blessings that are coming my way you know, and I was accepting them as they would come, and I was very thankful, I was attending church. Every Thursdays and Sundays and my was my ritual like whoever wanted to hang out with me said, as long as your own inner interfere, and my Thursday night church or any Sunday morning. i'm up for doing whatever it is, as long as I attend both things and my relationship kind of like pulled me away from it a little. And I am sorry, my employees are leaving now. I literally jumped on the call. Here at work, so I told him hey i'm gonna be my choir don't bug me. But my my yeah my life was great I went to Cuba. Like something that i've always wanted to do. I went to Cuba, I met new people there, I had a good time, like, I never thought in a million years I was going to be able to go to Cuba. I would go to Mexico and my girlfriend's like I traveled to New York, I did so many things like I was happy go lucky me I was just in my highest level me and. I want to get back to that I don't want it in this moment of crying over some lining and I always wanted to make something really strong and solid with this gentleman. But he just right now is not seeing clear I don't know if it's just him not seeing clear or is because of other things that we have gone through, but I know he knows who I am and what I have you know who I am and how great I am. He just doesn't know how to deal with my reactions to his actions. And, but. In like I said before, my relationship, I was. I can't even explain how happy I was all the time I was never side never lonely always had something to do, I always was like hey let's go here hey we should. say we should I feel like you know everybody's life has changed, right now, because of the pandemic, but I can remember, just two years, two years ago I was in a really good spot in my life. mm hmm yeah."

16694.0,Patient,"yeah i'm hoping i'm praying yeah you know, everybody keeps on telling me God God was better bigger things for you, you need to. let go of that past and just move forward and accept anything that's going to come your way, because with something top of your life that happens, and any loss that you go through. something better and better but greater you know good you know will come to you so i'm keeping that in my mind, because sometimes I feel very defeated and depleted, because I felt like I. My whole soul and it just like I just feel low something really low and I just hold my chest, because it hurts so bad and people, people say Oh, you know and they say oh my heart hurts as like it actually hurts, you know, like, I can say it actually hurts me because I. hold on to my chest. And, and I just hold on and press on it, because it hurts so bad, the feeling that I get. And that's why i'm like I need to get back to me like who are you."
759.0,Provider,"yeah. And you'll be one day be able to. Get back to that person, you know, like with a newfound understanding of what you went through in this knowing that it's going to be okay like whatever you know life throws at you."
16694.0,Patient,You know by way.
759.0,Provider,"And I I liked how you say you hold it, you know up here, you know, like in your chest, you can feel it because a lot of times trauma and what you went through a pretty dramatic. You know just put that out there that's dramatic you know, like, and you know, sometimes trauma lives inside the body and that way you know, like you know find new ways to kind of like. symptom management, you know to manage those emotions I think that's going to be the best way moving forward, but just the knowledge that you've been through you know that that was pretty significant what you just been through and just give yourself grace. You know, give yourself grace. In terms of i'm pretty sure you heard that concept to just forgiving and just be loving towards yourself."
16694.0,Patient,"Yes, and that's why i'm sorry i'm getting notifications because of this call. later. And you know I just tell myself things are going to get better, but you know I sometimes. Everybody told like my Michael my support system so like we don't understand what's why you still have so much hope after so much pain and agony that you have gone through with this person. But I said as I can't control, who I love like. Are you know, this is, who I love and I and it hurts me, you know, like, I will try my chance because it's like the pain of my daughter, the pain of him going and then him being willing to my daughter, and it just. I hold my chest because it's. In her. And I hurts my soul. You know, and I pray to God, I went to church and I said, please God just take this anxiety take this depression away I don't want to feel it anymore, I want to be fine, I want to be okay, and I had a great Sunday. Not to say i'm moving forward, and you know. yeah but i'm actually i'm moving forward, because you know i'm actually i'm hanging out with people that love me, you know, like i'm I reached out to my God mother and. She introduced me to her cousin and her and her cousins really nice and he's been hanging out with me and like that's been helping me. As well you know it's just like a different like a different person in my life that has a whole heart like he wholeheartedly cares because i'm somehow some way we never really got to. cross paths with it with each other, as we were growing up, but his family and my family know each other from back in Mexico so it's funny how we, like all somehow. You know, family friend and here just came up out of nowhere and it just popped up and and it's been helping me also. not feel so defeated because he's willing to share his time and spend time with me as friends and get and get to know each other, which is. You know, maybe it's that light at the end of the tunnel I don't know you know so i'm just kind of just. Allowing God do what he's doing you know, do I still love my ex partner absolutely I love him with all my heart and your keyword and you know changes his way of thinking wit and us work on the relationship I were totally say yes, without question. You know, work on each other first before even going back to that relationship. And being being. Whole with myself and him being whole and in order for us to blend it back together. Knowing that there's you know someone else that's caring and wants to get to know me and god's to get to know who I am. Actually, also helps me so i'm allowing it to come in, because at first, I was kind of guarded and said no, because of. boy there's something right now but I then said well if it's coming to me it's for a reason god's doing his work to you know, so I kind of i'm taking it as as well."
