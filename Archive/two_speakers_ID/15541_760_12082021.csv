760.0,Provider,"Was that a toxic household, as you said you used to be in your room, a lot of the time."
15541.0,Patient,"um there was just like zero communication between me and the parents. So a lot of the time, I would just overthink and I wasn't sure like what the rules were so I would, I would like be too careful and I get really stressed out about like how much noise, I was making and. I don't know being a burden, I guess, because I had such a hard time like consistently paying rent."
760.0,Provider,mm hmm.
15541.0,Patient,"So that that's kind of how that was a. utilities, there were kind of inconsistent like. They ran on a very small amount of propane so a lot of the time there was just no hot water. Was messy. The shower was I don't know moldy who was. Who was really hard for me to like get myself to do things in that house. And I I really didn't like showing my face like at all."
760.0,Provider,"Okay. I see, so you just kind of isolate yourself, which is one of your big triggering symptoms, is to be. alone like that so Okay, so how about how about physical health issues to have any physical health issues."
15541.0,Patient,um. I. Think I think i'm like always anemic what like. I don't know I don't know if I just don't eat enough or or what. But i'm always like feeling dizzy and like almost passing out and.
760.0,Provider,The last time you saw a doctor.
15541.0,Patient,"I think that was back, I think that was pretty much as. When I last went to the psychiatric Ward and so like. April, I want to say, like the end of April may be."

760.0,Provider,Okay well that's.
15541.0,Patient,You know.
760.0,Provider,"Okay that's a good coping skill listening to music and being outdoors, especially where you're at. Okay. Okay, so I think I asked the questions that I wanted to ask, but I wanted to say now that i've asked these questions. Do you have more feedback on some things that you would like to change or work on or improve."

15541.0,Patient,Can you think of a time that you've had better habits as far as you're eating and.
760.0,Provider,sleeping exercise. and general self care like getting up. getting around in the morning.
15541.0,Patient,"yeah, I guess, I guess, when I lived with my parents. yeah it was it was definitely I was brushing my teeth more I was eating every day. and Excuse me. and I kept I kept my room clean I don't have a room anymore."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, what do you sleep in the living room right now."

15541.0,Patient,"yeah they don't really work for me, though. Sometimes I mess, with the POP socket on the back of my phone and that that's a lot better than fidget toys that i've tried."
760.0,Provider,"Okay. Well, maybe the coloring would be a different way of. kind of similar but different, the same time, the coloring or the drawing. Okay. So, so you would like to build habits, so that would be what what's. what's an ideal habit for you what what would be ideal if we could just somehow magically. change the way you get up and your routine and all that what What would it look like, for you."
15541.0,Patient,um. I. brush my teeth every day.

760.0,Provider,And why you think that is.
15541.0,Patient,"Well before was I don't know i've actually always struggled with it, but. I think that."
760.0,Provider,"Sorry yeah a little kids a lot of times don't want to brush their teeth, so when you're a little. that's kind of normal. But when go ahead and say what you were gonna say about your previous home."
15541.0,Patient,"It was sense, it was hard to like leave my room like it just kind of couldn't so. It was I I tried to like form the habit, somehow, but when it wouldn't really take for more than a few days."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so you were uncomfortable you, you really had a tendency have to isolate yourself was there, the bathroom was across the hall or something there was no bathroom for you to easily access to either shower brush teeth, or just use the restroom."
15541.0,Patient,"yeah it was like there was one bathroom and then, on the other side of the bathroom there was the parents room so like you had to go through the bathroom to get into the room. hmm and that was really awkward. dang. yeah. So that that kept me out of the bathroom a lot. When I was little. Up until like like I don't know. middle school like seventh grade ish. I peed my pants all the time, like almost every day. So, like i've always kind of had issues with that. And that just kind of like made it worse. To an extreme."
760.0,Provider,Did you parents take it to the doctor at that time.
15541.0,Patient,That they got me on like. Like a special like counselor. plan.
760.0,Provider,Where I would.
15541.0,Patient,"I would have like scheduled bathroom breaks that I, there were mandatory. And now it's just like I don't know. With the medic medication, especially like the urges just really strong and sudden."
760.0,Provider,mm hmm. So yeah. So that part is no longer a problem then.
15541.0,Patient,not really. Now that i'm living here it's pretty easy to to like make it to the bathroom.

760.0,Provider,And what's happening let's see that you that you. don't be. Is there some emotion or. Is there something. Can you speak to me on that. What keeps you from doing it.
15541.0,Patient,it's it's. I really don't like. Looking at my body. For that kind of like period of time. And with the other place like the shower is gross and. There is not consistently hot water. And here I have to like ask somebody because of the showers and. Like the showers and somebody room again. So. I don't know there's always just like some obstacle that makes it extra hard for me.
760.0,Provider,"Like personally but it causes certain emotions. Take care of these hygiene. activities, including the teeth. Is that is that what I hear. Or, because you have to you have to ask to use the bathroom Stephen brush your teeth."
15541.0,Patient,"So you see, to forget."
760.0,Provider,"there's there's little things that you can do to help you develop habits. You know, you can you can write out a list either on a tablet on phone or just on paper, you can set up an alarm. and your phone. That goes off for you to do those things. Is there is there some. emotion that that. That you're struggling with as you're taking care of those hygiene items."
15541.0,Patient,I don't know I guess it's just like embarrassing to. Like ask you know I don't know why. But it's it's really embarrassing me.
760.0,Provider,And what. You don't know why.
15541.0,Patient,No.
760.0,Provider,"Is there a restaurant, is there a restaurant videos that that just that maybe has a pilot and just to think not, through this person, so you could brush your teeth in there."
15541.0,Patient,"yeah. yeah I it's also like still don't know why, but I just get really anxious about like making too much noise. being too noisy. And then, of course, when like there are lots of loud noises around me I get super stressed out and overwhelmed."
760.0,Provider,"Is it hard for you to go out and you know be around people like maybe to the store or just out in public in general, is that is that hard for you."
15541.0,Patient,yeah. yeah.
760.0,Provider,Is that something you want to work on.
15541.0,Patient,mm hmm definitely.
760.0,Provider,"But you're okay with going out in nature, because you're like you said isolated so that part is fine."
15541.0,Patient,But.
760.0,Provider,going to the store do you go to the store or anywhere.
15541.0,Patient,"On a some way I go. know that, before I didn't."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so well that's progress right there. you're starting to go. You starting to, though, what kinds of activities do you do when you go with people."
15541.0,Patient,"it's usually the main thing is is grocery shopping. that's usually that's usually why I am going somewhere, but if. The person driving has to do errands and stuff. Then you know i'll just go with."
760.0,Provider,"alright. So do you think next time, maybe we could start talking about. Creating a schedule and then perhaps we can start. Talking about some. Different coping skills, maybe some relaxation or mindfulness exercises to help you manage the anxiety and the anxiety just that you have to struggle with and then, when you go out as well, does that sound like something that. would help you."
15541.0,Patient,Do yeah.
760.0,Provider,"yeah and i'm hoping i'm hopeful that they can get you on a medication, that you can take because i'm hoping that just getting on medication will. You know, help better manage your symptoms, so that we can start working on some of these other things. That sound good to you. yeah okay. All right, let's see if you have any questions for me. I do want to say, if you ever have thoughts of wanting to to harm yourself there there's a hotline number. it's a nationwide number. It it's 988 so it's really easy to remember kind of like 911 but instead it's 988. And you can always call that if you're starting to feel. Having those kinds of dangerous thoughts. So that somebody could talk, talk to you about it in let's say it's like an off our. Okay."
15541.0,Patient,Okay.
760.0,Provider,"99 eight okay good. All right. I hope it was hasn't been too painful for you. All these questions. really good to you're really good to answer them and stick it stick it out. And I like the fact I see you taking deep breaths from time to time that's good. I think if. You added to your routine maybe a daily walk. might help you met better manage the anxiety that you experience. So one thing that I would suggest, are you doing the daily walks."
15541.0,Patient,"Usually. i'm usually at least like out here, just like sitting down and taking it in. Okay, but. I could definitely there's a there's places to go on walks around here."
760.0,Provider,"Well it's it's good when when somebody deals with a lot of fear and anxiety in their life. Take making you know physical activity is really helpful because. Because what happens when we get fearful or when we get anxious we entered the state that's called fight or flight I don't know if you remember learning about that in school. Fight or flight response. So we can have fight or flight response, even if we're having emotional pains or anxiety that's that's really what's happening, and so, because the body is kind of wired to want to move either running away or fighting. You know if we. Go on a walk or or even a run and. get some physical activity you're kind of going along with what your body, naturally. wants to do. Does that make some kind of sense to you."
15541.0,Patient,yeah.
760.0,Provider,"So so as. As you're building routine that would be one thing that I would strongly encourage is an exercise routine and that would be something that you could start like today. or build on just make it, you know, try to make a commitment to yourself that you're going to do this daily unless, of course. it's raining or something and can't. But then, you could have a plan of. Maybe some jumping Jacks in the House or something so there's not nothing. Okay."
15541.0,Patient,Okay.
760.0,Provider,Are you does that sound good to you.
15541.0,Patient,yeah.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, all right. All right, let's see well i'm i'm going to reach out to your care navigator and have them contact you to set up the appointment to talk about your medication. And then, also for our next session. So you know, let me know how. If you could just kind of notice how successful, are you at. Building this new thing in your routine of exercise and. If you can kind of let me know. You know how it helps you manage your symptoms better. Does that make sense. yeah. Okay, so thanks again for. putting up with my questions, and I do look forward to working with you again seeing you again."
15541.0,Patient,Thank you.
760.0,Provider,"All right, let's see. Is there anything else you want to say."
15541.0,Patient,"Oh, that was cathartic. it's nice to talk about those things, you know that. sort of instead of just keeping them inside."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so you're repressing. yeah. You know what happens to us when we repress our."
15541.0,Patient,Emotions.
760.0,Provider,You know the consequences of that thought about that.
15541.0,Patient,yeah. it's not good.
760.0,Provider,"well. We can either we can either hold it to a point where we explore some people explode they explode at the wrong time in the wrong place in the wrong way, creating more problems for themselves, and some people kind of implode."
15541.0,Patient,and
760.0,Provider,"People can make themselves sick. Because we have a tendency to hold it in certain parts of our body. or people can affect our our mental health, causing things like Depression and anxiety. make sense."
15541.0,Patient,yeah.
760.0,Provider,"So you don't have to hold your emotions together on my account. And I know there's probably some part of you, that is, maybe used to that. But I just going to say that and. I understand that that might be a struggle for you, but on my account it's not a problem. Okay. All right, let's see well, I will like I said i'll reach out to your care navigator and have them get in contact with you for those two appointments okay."
15541.0,Patient,"Okay. All right, thank you."
760.0,Provider,"Thank you, Nice meeting you."
