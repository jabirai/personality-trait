Now, working in his head that gamma rays and tires my new tires on my car had total wins and make space niche and. put them up till I get them so just I don't want some more rugrats dragon my brand new rims and tires off my car. I had I had to have it out with tire discounters say. Well, I was locked up day I wanted a new set of wrench and tires for my car you mean and I sent mama bear to get them well they put 18 inch rims and tires on my car when it came with 19th factory, you know mean. Well, make a long story short, when I go to try new brakes on my car. They won't fit because it's grinding on inside of that will become smaller, so you know I fought with them for two years man over this situation well finally. I don't know I guess it's been a couple months ago I was bringing mom home. From the. weed store because she yes, she does the medical marijuana thing, and I look over and see tire discounted corporate office in downtown Cincinnati well. Bam I hit the exit I taken go in there and explain to them what's going on, I was just two years later and i've been fighting with them over this stuff and what's the point to where my car is getting ready to crash out because I have no good brakes on you mean. Not safe or not safe but also drive you i'm saying well. That could leave it, I thought I was line and for shit you know I mean everything else i'm like look at my cars two blocks up to get to some gym shoes on a walk up here and you. want to make a long story short, again be home guys and corporate office up here and. batavia calls me and he's like can you bring the car up here, and let me look at it and you mean like well yeah sure, so when we get up there i'm like well what's the answer to the solution well they kept want to put these phasers on my car which would push the rim out farther. and allow the brake caliper not to grind you see i'm saying well I got to thinking about it i'm like. hell nah man I didn't pay for something like that to be half ass down you mean. about the car brand new it's a 2013. charger and stuff i'm like I take a lot of pride in the car you i'm saying like no i'm not doing something like that you mean plus it's dangerous they say on on aluminum rims do something like that anyways. Talking or you with him and into it with them so finally today i'm like I said I got tired, right now, they wanted to grind on it, they wanted to take a factory stuff that's under warranty and take a grinder to my calipers and write them. yeah and what's going to go, and that was it that was their answer to the solution to fix it and i'm like well buddy don't you think I should just start something out of this, you know i'm saying right y'all a already put it grew my follow me back up the first day the first day. They did nothing to the car Okay, the second day they got a moaner but then they call online back and told her that. Take a car up in the morning, be ready in the morning, when she gets there immediately she had to turn around and come back she heard grinding right well I don't know but I realized now what it was, it was the rotor era CAP or binding on inside of the rim right. Well then, I took input that's phasers owner and the brake pads will we're down enough to where it would when RON and right so she we've dropped it the whole time until now you mean and. Basically they've just grown up take a stick and screw me without no vaseline big thorn stick at that you owe me."

It was just horrible man that's what went wrong, it could have went wrong for me you mean it's like everything I do manage his keys totally totally totally. I mean i'm getting so draining we're out from the Judas like what is it everyone in man it's not ferreted like it's killing me man my grill. So, are you a dad dude forever got my mom falling resin tires on a car and. Then they'll get a new brake pads put on two routers on everything, I mean getting a damn car and. The ABS law it's on and damn boy drive lights on, to now around with ABS lights on and no damn from those are all wheel drive me crazy craziness So why did."
706.0,Provider,We got anyone else so.
4415.0,Patient,"I don't exactly that's my point like what the hell, did you all do now, you mean like i'm just so tired though muscle mass, and so I I can't pick up the phone and call someone tagging the dod. To where we always get ourselves going to use the same person every time you know I mean like I could do it myself, you know i'm saying, but when it comes to like my mom's car. I taken habit dumb professional up by the dealership because I like using the dealership parts and all that the last. yeah they're twice as much too and i'm like yeah but you don't look at the outcome, like that car's got almost 100,000 miles on it i'm just not changing the brake pads come on man, you will tell me that those during something special. or different about them to come out there has to be you. Like if you ever noticed like your tires on your car if you buy a new and they last a whole lot longer and you're tired you get from out of the store it's crazy I don't know I mean I know why you're saying, but like. I can convince people that to where you could pay the difference and notice that you mean I can. So I always try to take care of mom's car to make a long story short and I go to that do not take the dealership. i'm i'm just gonna call him and have him see if he can hook this scanner out to find out what they are and cut them all. Because the ABS light and all that stuff was off the track control, which is always drive was never on at all I think it's just something simple as it needs to be reset real. Just because from our like we put the new brake pads on their everyday bs I was coming on because of it needing pads and stuff you mean. So you know, having said that venture, but I thought I got my rims and tires in my shed mode once I didn't want to leave them send out my still them that would just really put icing on the cake for me."
706.0,Provider,Yes.
4415.0,Patient,"I mean I got a good deal and resin tires my mom's happy with them, I like them a lot I love them really. Oh no maybe so good just allows able to do something like a long, long you been."

4415.0,Patient,"You know, unfortunately, like, I told you before like here, I was we had on coming from my back pay for my own employment stuff and then. She passed away and stuff so like I mean I got I got a lot, you know quite a bit of money left over, but like I don't care if you don't even bother me no more i'm to that point where like. Money don't even matter to me no more nothing like i'm calling contend with what I got you don't need nothing special."
706.0,Provider,yeah when things happen.
4415.0,Patient,it's nice to have that stuff you mean.
706.0,Provider,"yeah no absolutely and but the one thing. To pay real close attention. To is you know when things happen like your girlfriend passing away that was such a tragedy, you know, and I you deal with other stress with your car and have an argue with them again like you they're trying to screw you over. And all those things are triggers and when you're triggered and you have money, money is also a trigger. Is. Easy would it be just be like screw it all and go get high like you said, because you have the money, you know it's not like you have that barrier that you can't."
4415.0,Patient,You know i'll have no roadblocks you know I mean.
706.0,Provider,Honestly that's so. it's even because there's nothing stopping you.
4415.0,Patient,"and out of pocket pocket for money and Nice carbs and brand new rims and tires on there, and no nothing to do i'm on the phone i'm on my soapbox and Dr and. Are not doctor, but my my psychiatrist or counselor and I have nothing else to do and i'm pissed off with the world right now, and I might as well go get on that's what that's what I would have said and that's the way I look at stuff but i'm not you know me. way too far to give it up man i've done i've done been down that road with the with the suboxone and heroin situation, it takes a lot a lot, a lot of dope to get you if you maintain."
706.0,Provider,Our black.
4415.0,Patient,"And then uh. And then, then you're pissed at the world because I just spent 100 hours on a. You know, on grammar dub and then you get off."
706.0,Provider,that's why because the scraps on plaster blocks the receptors in your brain that allows opiates in to get you high.
4415.0,Patient,and using the. village all right or not.
706.0,Provider,"yep yep they're the same thing, except for with the trial, if you have any sort of opiate in your system what so."
4415.0,Patient,"Nor, nor can right now. Okay, then losses, and nor can right."
706.0,Provider,yeah so in our can reverses the effects of the heroin or the.
4415.0,Patient,narcan or narcan has done the locks and then the same thing that's in my suboxone right.
706.0,Provider,"Yes, there's there's similar similar ingredients, yes, not completely but. But I mean there's certain things like that, if you take that, and you have any kind of populate in your system that will put you into immediate severe withdrawal."
4415.0,Patient,"Like me, oh yeah yeah I can't do that."
706.0,Provider,yeah so like the trolley that's the that's the one when they say that you need to be clean for seven days before you can go on it.
4415.0,Patient,You need to be clean those because.
706.0,Provider,"If you don't, you will get so unbelievably."
4415.0,Patient,"i've done that that dumb ass mistake, even with my subs like. yeah, I would like, I would like try to escape the time from you know from my P O not we get hot three weeks and then. Stop well, I thought, how just that one day I could. stop getting high on heroin and then just taking a do a sub the next day within 24 hours, I mean I had all this stuff figured out Stacey down to a TEE to were like. Oh, like. All you gotta do is wait 24 hours, I can take some subs that blocks blocks the usage from my hair when like I can literally take it say used today. Take a piss test 24 hours from now and i'm clean and won't show up because the the The sub suboxone box everything out of my P, you know I mean it's crazy like that, but uh to make a long story short what's i'm not doing that, so you don't have to worry about that. To make a long story short on that note, like. If you take a piece of that so take a piece of that suboxone within without wait 24 hours, it will send you into the worst detox your head your life. You know me i've done went down that road with it on never attempt that again, I mean. Because they know what happened to me. To me after that I went and spent an hour hundred hours and got it got on another grand I heroin and had to do the whole grand to get myself right, and then you know what happened after that. I didn't stop for 24 hours or 48 I didn't stop or 72 I went in and pitched starting with President for a while you fucking idiot you mean."
706.0,Provider,"But you can look back on that, and you see this is where I messed up and you see this is what I don't want to do again. So you don't want to you don't want to just keep you don't want to always be looking behind you that way, because then you can't move forward, but you don't want to forget what happened in the past, because that's making you who you are today."
4415.0,Patient,"Absolutely yeah for sure I just like don't don't that was who mean I could have met in homes for the top of my girl you mean. yeah I got cheated her out of so much time around, when you mean in any cool right yeah."

4415.0,Patient,yeah she definitely was man.
706.0,Provider,"you've come a long way. Oh, and just the way that you think like because that that first thought is every addict every addict brain has that first thought was screw this i'm just going to go get high when things get rough that's where you go that's where your brain goes."
4415.0,Patient,"But the nerves. Turn i've been there 10 times today. And 15 yesterday, but I know I can."
706.0,Provider,that's the difference that's the difference between somebody who's in recovery and somebody who is not is i'm not going back to that.

4415.0,Patient,"I definitely want to get my lupus checked out because I can spots on my skin are freaking me out I can't i'm not i'm not healing like when I get bruised or get cut or whatever i'm not healing I okay Take, for instance, like Can you see at spot on my wrist right there. yeah okay that's a burn mark from mom or did I was working on three and a half weeks ago. Why the hell and i've been putting antibiotic ointment on it and keeping it closed and taking care of the line i'm not handling you mean."
706.0,Provider,"doctor immediately, because that doesn't look very good."
4415.0,Patient,"I guess it's from that lupus you know me and, like my leg like I was trying to show you like, I know I know you can see the difference in the size. I don't know, can you see the redness that's in this one. Here and it's so crazy because, like around those little spots. There like it's red around there you mean. yeah that's a weird Okay, so I thought I thought I had that so you like to share or whatever Okay, well, I took four rounds of antibiotics two rounds of. I can't remember the name of them and then went back there was like Oh, you still got it bad bad infection take take these well the swelling will go down, but the redness will never go away right so. Then all the shed started going on and happening, and I just said Fuck it, you know I mean i'm not going. After and stuff like that I got down and adults and everything else, but now my mom said Okay, so now she's telling me like i'm not going to the doctor and getting checked out if you don't go to the doctor and get checked out and she's like."
706.0,Provider,she's like.
4415.0,Patient,"yeah she was like i'll just lay around here and let myself down i'll take care of myself if you're not going to take care of yourself and see like my situations way way worse because. A monocle he he died from a blood this work and in a big big biggest thing is, is my grandma which is my mom's mom died when she was really, really, really young from a similar disease like lupus and. I couldn't I didn't know where it was. yeah but it. All it all comes back comes back to Lucas because that's a mile ahead and I got. My uncle had there was a little different in lupus but. Mine is extremely rare because it's like one out of 10 million men get it you mean. Like."
706.0,Provider,"The concern that I have is. Some of the symptoms that you're having. don't necessarily work with lupus like the not healing. Okay, clearly something with lupus, and so I think it's something you really should get get checked out."
4415.0,Patient,Like I know I got a history of blood clots and. hi it's not heard like a boycott is but.
706.0,Provider,"it's so much that but I mean there's other things there's like. Blood cancer there's you know. there's a lot of things. That could be wrong that are causing your body, not to heal to have your immune system not working."
4415.0,Patient,"crazy part, then the crazy part about it is it's like on. My boss. Stacy i'm sorry."
706.0,Provider,that's okay. But I really. think you should get an appointment go in and see your PCP show them all of the things that.
4415.0,Patient,"saying I don't have one right now, and when I was at the hospital with online.

Tolerance stay at a high rate, if you ever do want to come off of two and a half way harder to come off of into. brother down explain everything to me like that and I he reassured me 100 times like you're not going to feel any different taken to than two and a half years, like.
