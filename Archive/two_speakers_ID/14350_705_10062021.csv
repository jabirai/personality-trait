You can start to build even more confidence that you know what even right now, you were able to do the right thing you called for assistance you're able, you know, to talk about it. And that the level is come down a bit. And this is. You know if you've been in for so long and you're not hearing noises and you're not having to interact. Our body and brain already gets easily startled and so, then, if you've had that in your past, it can amplify when we go out and and that's where. These different experiences, even though Vanessa i'm sorry, you had to go through this today. Your brain can start to be rewired where you're like you know what when i'm stressed now when i'm feeling anxious now i'm going to reach out i'm going to talk to someone i'm going to try to do you know these different coping skills and be able to you know go from there. With like earlier and we talked about like the song, are you visual or do you like like could be as i'm thinking of in that moment, where we talked about that roller coaster.

14350.0,Patient,To hear the sound of my head.
705.0,Provider,i'll cry. yeah it would be great to. Listen to that song even more often and see if this could be something that's self soothing when you need it. Do you have that song like can you can you play it do you have a some type of a something to play it on at home.

And it is like okay pulling out everything from the toolbox."
14350.0,Patient,attract a day.
705.0,Provider,For. Like was there any indication of your like sometimes our body will tell us even before we know that we're. we're about to head into crisis mode. Was there anything that indicated to you.

In times that you need it it's like yes, you know don't don't sit on it and just it's like now from from today. It could be you know with the heart palpitations is, if you feel that in the future that's like Okay, is it outside that may distract me more is it if I had that song that song that you. called I thought I wrote it down, but I didn't write it down the song that you had. SOS SOS. Which means help right."
14350.0,Patient,yeah.
705.0,Provider,isn't that interesting that you chose a song that already means help.
14350.0,Patient,Yes.

14350.0,Patient,it's funny that you mentioned.
705.0,Provider,"yeah well it is it's that trait that your your mom chose to be creative and then here you are with designing and not like such a creative you know talent and it takes skill. And you seem like you have a passion for it. yeah yeah. So right now with chantel to Vanessa have you been like on the same medication, or worse, or any changes recently."
14350.0,Patient,"They gave me the APP they added things it. States ad of pill. Before I did the President, I have that one. To one, so they will help me to go to sleep."
705.0,Provider,"And the anxiety one do you take it every day, or only as needed."
14350.0,Patient,"Efficient it told me, like all these are needed. I took one today. Yesterday I took one ad hoc today, I took another one did. You say that I can take to."
705.0,Provider,"You did take to today. i'll call and that's what i'm wondering to Vanessa i'm glad you're sharing this because, is it possible, like a new job as it's on the top three things that are stressful. I think it's job. Moving an end of relationships. So. Having a new job is full of changes and can already be anxiety provoking. Is it. After your after you were filling publications, did you take it then or you just took it this morning."
14350.0,Patient,I took it this morning.
705.0,Provider,"Okay, how many hours, do you think after you took it in the morning how many hours, do you think until you started filling shaky."
14350.0,Patient,three.
705.0,Provider,"Maybe three hours okay. And you're going to see chantelle again on. I can send her an email to follow up with her Vanessa to see like you said. She said, you could take to. ditch does the pills say how many hours in between, it needs to be."
14350.0,Patient,"yeah, but I have it. Maybe not I haven't paid attention to it."
705.0,Provider,"yeah so you know, on there I would see if it if it does, let me see if I can bring up anything on my end. You know what I can do to if, let me see if by chance chantelle is, if I can texture do you have a minute Vanessa are we okay. yeah Okay, let me see I can. So i'm going to just see if. She can tell. And let's see Vanessa how long you been with bright heart health Vanessa."
14350.0,Patient,It since. Since I get out get out get out of the hospital.
705.0,Provider,Okay.
14350.0,Patient,"Now it's under 18. Last month, no. it's."
705.0,Provider,Okay. Since August okay. i'm your medication that you take for inside it is it. add a van or xanax. Do okay. But you know it's the one for your anti anxiety.
14350.0,Patient,yeah i'm sorry i'm so bad with names.
705.0,Provider,"that's Okay, no worries i'm just gonna let her know and see if she's in right now. And you took the one this morning at like 1010 Now let me see if she's in and, if so, if she will. answer that. And then I will look up to my end Vanessa to see if I can find which one. hey. hello, do you have to work. The six till six okay."
14350.0,Patient,I work nine to six.
705.0,Provider,"And in between when you're working do you ever have a time that even even if you don't need a break, but you're able to just take a break and it's always good to kind of reset."
14350.0,Patient,If we don't have clients.
705.0,Provider,Okay yeah if you don't have a client then then that's okay.
14350.0,Patient,"yeah so the time since very quiet at the beginning with a month. Then, at the end of the money gets pretty busy sometimes we don't even have time to go into lunch."
705.0,Provider,"yeah that's do you feel like to because I know we're all different, do you thrive when it gets better or is that you know, for you, you notice that maybe you're more hs."
14350.0,Patient,If they would.
705.0,Provider,Have when you get busy if you have more customers. Do you. tend to then like some people thrive on it and others are just like you know.
14350.0,Patient,depends on the client.
705.0,Provider,Oh. that's a good factor absolutely.
14350.0,Patient,i'm excited to see them and some taste like.
705.0,Provider,"hey I appreciate your honesty and that is this right. People you mesh with and some not as much. yeah yeah chantelle is saying that yes, you can take a second one. So i'm wondering if if maybe you know, let me ask her to. See. Let me see so for tomorrow. Like the spacing for your future use. Okay, so do you have the the pill anywhere like handy Vanessa."
14350.0,Patient,"That with me from the other side. There it is, in my office, I mean the back. room."
705.0,Provider,"i'll cry if if you feel like you know. i'm just going to be really honest with you Vanessa here's here's hell and you probably already know what's inside it is sometimes when our. anxiety peaks and if we leave sometimes our mind gets like oh when we're anxious we leave and then we become anxious before we get to work because that's where it happened right. yeah and so trying to get where you can still come into work. If you're in crisis, usually work it out and your brain will start to remember, we don't flee when this happens, like we work it out, just like he did like you called. You were able to calm yourself down there's also now and i'm getting chantel the answer of how much the spacing for future use so like tomorrow, you could already have it planned. Where if you feel like you need it, you take the first one, and then, if you start to have the the politicians that you could then take the second one. To give you late, because sometimes medication can help. put it down even a notch is helpful. and, especially, why you why you're able to learn new skills and learn new things, this is a different arena for you you're at work now you haven't been at work in a while. So she saying you're on a low dose so I, I will say Okay, and so that means that, like we said you don't really she's saying you don't have to wait like a certain amount of hours it's low enough that you could then take the second if you felt you needed it. Okay okay. Let me just tell her much. it's good to get that then with your plan it's almost like a sometimes people call it their insurance policy it's like your insurance policy. You go into work, you. Have it if you need it."
14350.0,Patient,Right yeah.
705.0,Provider,"yeah and you may find that some days you need it and some days you do not. it's. being mindful that this is new, for you, this is a big change and some of what you're feeling today is natural it's going to happen and you went through the whole thing you're still here right. yeah. And it's like Okay, and then tomorrow. is getting back out there if if you start to fill even the slightest with the heart palpitation tell yourself, I know what to do and start listening to that song if you can. And I know some of these some of these depends if you're right in the middle, with the customer, when you can excuse yourself. But if you can start getting that maybe early on, have that SOS song or even sing a verse of the SOS song in your head and just you know write it on a notepad whatever you have to do to get some strength from that."
14350.0,Patient,Okay. to that.
705.0,Provider,"and I know that, before you know that things were or you said in August that you joined in the that time even like suicidal thoughts did did anything like i'm just for today, are you having any type of thinking. Okay. That right there then Vanessa is progress is that you didn't go there. You know and that's where it's like Okay, I am not comfortable I know this is not a comfortable thing but i'm making it through and it didn't go to that place that maybe before. And that's definitely we you know at bright heart hell definitely if you're ever having those types of feelings, you know don't hesitate call do you like to text or talk to people."
14350.0,Patient,I like to text.
705.0,Provider,"Okay, have you heard of the text crisis line."
14350.0,Patient,I think they give it to me in the hospital i'm not sure.
705.0,Provider,"yeah let's just say it's two o'clock in the morning. And you just you know briefly you're like what am I going to do. The 741741 it's a crisis hotline or you could just say you know hey having some anxiety not feeling it my best, and they can help like talk you through it where it's just one more resource. So just to give you like different things that you can like I said, your insurance policies or you're just bringing them all in with you and you're like Okay, you know. I think sometimes you know with anxiety is some more that you get to notice. Sometimes No two days are alike and so it's just like one day deep breathing might work, the next day, maybe visualization. And some days to maybe more of the medication that anti anxiety meds that you are given by chantelle. may even help you more in those days."
14350.0,Patient,That make sense.
705.0,Provider,"You know a lot of this to to me Vanessa them, the more that you were describing like what you're going through and how it came out of nowhere, I say that's exactly anxiety and especially with a big change in your life. You know how how's it been to the you seem like you work with some great colleagues there your co workers."
14350.0,Patient,"Very welcoming like they're they're awesome I really like my feet, like my group. yeah you're pretty cool if they're very caring too. I mean I love, what I do is I can I, like the place where i've worked in the people. yeah just their different times you know. brace a little bit stressful."
705.0,Provider,"yeah and that's where have patience with yourself and give yourself like today, a big win because right now, you didn't leave you told her anxiety that no matter how much I dislike it i'm managing and you did it. And then now it's just like Okay, I have some things that maybe I can try and that's what it's all about is just trying something else, and not giving up. You know."
14350.0,Patient,Thank you.
705.0,Provider,"Oh absolutely is there to. You know just this next week, if if there's anything that you can start to identify even within the Office like is there a space in the office that's more inviting to you or self soothing for you."
14350.0,Patient,hmm. And made me.
705.0,Provider,Okay yeah just.
14350.0,Patient,"Because I have, I have my we have the Office for all the designers and we have cubicles but today I couldn't stay there. And then the back room and then, which is more quiet I just needed some quiet."
705.0,Provider,Bingo. you're already identifying it because you know you're like hey I have the self awareness that in this time I need some peace and quiet. And now you're starting to find that maybe that's one of the places that you can you can go with needed to have that you know check out for a few minutes.
14350.0,Patient,The background Nice.
705.0,Provider,"hey you you created Vanessa style, so I already know your creative and so. However, you do it, you know, make it Vanessa style. mm hmm and the same thing too with. All the other, you know techniques, we usually at bright heart health we have different ones, and what I love is usually i'll give someone something and then they branch off of there and they make it their own. cold therapy is another one that people have really taken advantage of if you have anything in the the freezer Have you ever done the cold therapy. The cold therapy, you can get like an ice pack people or even getting like a bag of ice I have where some are putting it like right here. And so you know you sit the ice there are sometimes on the face, but the ice is going to lower the the coldness lowers the blood pressure, which could help ease off of the blood pressure for a moment the heart, you know trying the cold therapy is another one. The hands, I have where people do self soothing where you take the tips and it's just a form of trying to ground and distract yourself. So that's one of them, I have where the deep breathing and you go in and the next Hill and then and then exhale. So you when you get a chance Vanessa try these different things, and if they. feel like oh my gosh I don't that that is not self soothing to me at all. check it off your list start to rule out things.
