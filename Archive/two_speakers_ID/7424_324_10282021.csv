Like 10 days before my mammogram and. i'll ultrasound I was some I wasn't feeling like that stressed out or some reason I was having nightmares and really bad sleep problems is little bit better now um, but I have injured my back i'm at a point where I can really sit. So and it's very hard for me to sleep, too, because it hurts when it's bad it hurts even sometimes laying down."
324.0,Provider,You.
7424.0,Patient,"know, I have a back injury from 2009 or if. You have, I have two bulging discs and I have to always keep my stomach and back muscles strong and for a while I have stopped doing stretching and the exercises I need to do. And then, because I work with a group, like yoga and our group kind of dispersed and everybody wants somewhere for two three months I didn't do anything, and I must have done something I don't know it just not exercising I don't know how it got so bad, to the point where. I can sit and this is how it was when I was first injured and it took like over a year for me to recover back then it's not as bad as buck them but um. it's just somehow got really, really bad, so I can't sit on any soft surface or even hard surface for too long. And I have to like really now start working on my stomach and back muscles and hopefully i'll get little bit better but i'm like I started medication and timeslot much harder medicine, but i'm little bit worried about that, because it is the blood. So, still have to check my blood frequently and see how it goes i'm really hoping this medicine and the this exercise, I started, yesterday I started doing extra like morning and nighttime working on my stomach i'm back and i'm we'll see so that's just because this comfort me like. You know, take them I said little bit, but but it's still not as bad as it was, like last week and the week before i'm trying to make less than. i'm still going to like xanax being likes like i'm being is still just gives me a headache and just very unpleasant on side effects. I would say stills annex is like my number one choice for me to just leave um but i'm trying really hard to use as little as possible, so I usually like will you know, try to do with little sleep two days you know and then third day i'll take it, I have to. yeah so now I just I really need to work on my back because I want to go see my family and the way my back is, it will be really hard for me to travel."

324.0,Provider,how's your mood and anxiety been.
7424.0,Patient,"My anxieties is better compared to last month or so it's better now that I also know, like my ultrasonic and i'm a gram came out normal, so I am feeling, you know morning peace. upon you know nothing like that alarming on my mind, I mean i'm still getting thinking about this and that my finances, but um. But not as bad as like when I was worried so much about my mom and grandma and and, for some reason I had this thing that it was going to come back. I think, because of my nightmares that I was thinking in my head, it must be a sign that it will be bad because i'm having my nightmares I was always like it was coming back and then I had to have my breasts removed. So that was like constantly telling me, it must be if you know, a feeling telling me what's going to happen in the future, so I. Just I keep myself."
