Disease trust I have all these different things. And that's not it. anger. Ah, there it is. So what, if anything, do you know about grief."
16045.0,Patient,"lot I mean. I mean i've gone through it a lot and I just. You know, through that process, I tried to figure it all out, you know. it's it's it's the strongest emotion, for me, still if I if I think about somebody i've lost or something that it just it just makes me sad, you know I just it's probably still the strongest emotion, I get and I think. I was using during that whole time I was losing people, so I was covering it all up you know with drugs, to begin with, and so it's like now it's like. You know I try to avoid thinking about it, you know because it's it says it really sends me, it makes me sad but I think the suboxone has helped with that actually no. Okay."
741.0,Provider,"that's good okay grief is actually a natural response to loss. Yes, and it's not necessarily loss of a person. It can be loss of anything. A drug of choice."
16045.0,Patient,yeah. It can be. Anything okay.
741.0,Provider,And one of the things that I had I had to mourn the loss of my lifestyle. What because I was so entrenched in that lifestyle. and doing what I did every day and and that kind of thing that I actually had more than that.
16045.0,Patient,yeah i've never heard you know you're right i've never heard that you're right that's that's true.
741.0,Provider,"I best friend is our drug. yeah we've given it everything. yeah yes, we have to mourn it. yeah, we have to say goodbye."
16045.0,Patient,Right.
741.0,Provider,So you know what's coming right. My letter your drug of choice.
16045.0,Patient,that's a good idea i've never even thought of that but you're right.
741.0,Provider,"Okay, but i'm serious I want you to write a good play letter to your drug of choice. Okay Okay, because. grief is loss of anything. Okay, so and another um yeah i'm just wondering, have you said goodbye to the people that you've lost."
16045.0,Patient,I would say no. Okay.
741.0,Provider,"No Okay, so it sounds like you have some goodbye letter to right. And the first one, obviously I want to your drug of choice. Okay Okay, and then the other one would be um any other person that was a significant loss in your life. Like like your girlfriend. um anybody else parents our."
16045.0,Patient,"fault, my father."
741.0,Provider,"yeah yeah your father, a sibling. Anything along that line that was. Technically, significant enough to change your way of life. Yes, okay um. I don't know about you, but i've had a couple of jobs that when I got fired I they threw me for a loop. Yes, and I had to actually more that whole process to and and in that letter you need to tell them. What was special about them. What you're going to miss. And what some of the consequences of their loss are. And so the one to your drug of choice is going to be a little bit different than the one to people. Wait because your consequences of its loss i'm more likely to be positive than negative."
16045.0,Patient,that's true.
741.0,Provider,If you're really honest about.
16045.0,Patient,yeah no that's true.
741.0,Provider,um so um. So there's three letters that I know for sure that you have to fight between now and our next appointment. Okay okay.
16045.0,Patient,"Yes, yes."
741.0,Provider,"And, and then I will send you those um. I have a i've got two or three on grief. different areas I here, here it is yes. This one my yeah. i'm looking to see. yeah. Moving on, with my life. um yeah there are several of them here that I will send to you, and am I having difficulty letting go. and ask some questions of the different things that you might feel. And then moving on and what would my ideal life look like. and There is. I was looking also to see cuz there is there actually are several stages for grief. I know. I don't I don't get to see people in in like front of me anymore so. it's a different is a different situation kind of different. Having to adjust."
16045.0,Patient,Right right.
741.0,Provider,"cuz i'm handing out tons of paper. and Today I don't have I don't get to do that. And, in some ways is good, but in some ways it's not."
16045.0,Patient,Wait right.
741.0,Provider,"And i'm looking. i'm not looking i'm not finding it. Phase okay there's starts talking about basis. Okay, and that's kind of weird. There are like seven stages of grief. Okay, and. The first one, obviously, is shock."
16045.0,Patient,Like disbelief yes.
741.0,Provider,"Okay that's usually your very first reaction to the law somebody. Yes, um there is also. A period of. anger."
16045.0,Patient,"Usually, yes."
741.0,Provider,"And a period of. Depression and sadness and then there is also a kind of a stage where you bargain your bargain with God. You know. Please don't Let this be true. Can you let them live or come back to me or whatever i'll do whatever you know but it's a bargaining stage. Yes, and and. So there are a lot of. ways to process each of those stages and those stages, unfortunately i'm you move back and forth in them. Just because today, I am sad tomorrow, I could be really angry. yeah i'm just going through that anger stage being mad at God and being mad at the world that I have to deal with this by myself."
16045.0,Patient,Right right.
741.0,Provider,"And then the. There is also there's disbelief or shot. and go anger bargaining. Depression and sadness i'm. Trying to think. Okay, and then acceptance, obviously, is the. final stage, and there are some days when you can be fully accepting. This is the way it is. But then tomorrow be pissed off again. Right, you know I mean we move back and forth through the stages, all the time."
16045.0,Patient,yeah. Oh yeah I had a.
741.0,Provider,feeling of guilt that I didn't do I didn't do that one really ate me up.
16045.0,Patient,Like I didn't do enough to save somebody or.
741.0,Provider,"That survivor's guilt. yeah i'm it happens frequently Okay, here we go anger obviously denial anger bargaining depression and acceptance. What are the five stages there Elizabeth kubler Ross is five stages of death."
16045.0,Patient,Right.
741.0,Provider,And and. We can either accept the reality of the loss and express the pain of the grief and then adjust to the environment. and emotionally relocate. Our our our feelings are where we're at you know. and there's a lot of good books out there. On grief and there's good grief men and grief beyond grief. When bad things happen to good people. And life after life.
16045.0,Patient,yeah.
741.0,Provider,"And so I will probably scan this, and this is a handout of stages of grief and a reading list. The that I think this is actually from my death and dying class."
16045.0,Patient,"Oh well, I actually had a class on death and dying yes."
741.0,Provider,and it's been studied extensively and some of my training is actually from. I was at 1.8. administrator nursing home.
16045.0,Patient,Oh wow.
741.0,Provider,"So that's something that we actually have to okay here this one, they have from from the book good grief he clicked he winds out 10 different stages. Which is sharp an emotional release depression loneliness and a sense of isolation. Physical symptoms of distress. The first stage of grief begins when people become panicky. feeling guilty. yeah everything related related to their loss. yo hostility unable to return to usual activities. and begin to overcome the grief and then readjust life to. reality. I think I think i'll i'll send you this one, because that one actually speaks more to the. The feeling of guilt. yeah that that people tend to experience. Because. First of all, a lot there's a lot of us that take on responsibility that doesn't belong to us. yeah and. And i'm not sure why we do that, but we do. yeah and we are overly responsible. I guess, because we were told it was our fault I don't know."
16045.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
741.0,Provider,"So I think I scan this and and send this to you, because this is like um and it also has the good grief. The name of the book."
16045.0,Patient,and
741.0,Provider,"The author Okay, if you wanted to. Look, for that book. That would also um. And this is okay, this is something else that you might want to do, and your greatest lot my greatest loss was blank. and during that time, my most predominant feeling was blank. Oh cool i'll send you also this this little questionnaire thing."
16045.0,Patient,OK.
741.0,Provider,"OK OK also during that time I blank so you can list other feelings that you had the thing that meant the most to me then was blank. Right okay. So that I will do. And then I will also send you the. Those worksheets that I found on agree. and Because there are. Like I said, we do live, we do have to grieve our. Loss of our drug of choice."
16045.0,Patient,yeah I didn't ever look at it that way you're right.
741.0,Provider,It unfortunately grief and sorrow are related to anything and everything. And i'm. We just don't. Usually handle it well.
16045.0,Patient,that's for sure.
741.0,Provider,"And we have a tendency to get stuck well and I don't know about you, but for myself when i'm using i'm numbing all the emotion."
16045.0,Patient,Oh for sure.
741.0,Provider,So when I got clean and sober it was like a tidal wave. of emotion and there were days when I couldn't stop crying.
16045.0,Patient,Oh yeah.
741.0,Provider,You look at me. The wrong way and I cried. And sometimes I couldn't even label the feeling.
16045.0,Patient,Oh yeah.
741.0,Provider,"And I wonder if you because you tend to you seem to me to have a tendency to be a feely type person. Yes, and you try to stop it and numb it and. Are you experiencing those overwhelming days."
16045.0,Patient,"You know, since i've been in this program. It hasn't been. As bad you know i'm honestly it's it was before that, when you know anytime I wasn't snorting a pill or something the emotions, you know, whereas withdrawing or whatever I didn't have it in my system. I, like you were saying, I would just think of something and start crying you know and in all the time, you know i'd be driving and start crying. Once I got. snorted pill, or whatever, then I nominate and not think about it, and then. That was my That was my cycle, you know it was it was constant it was for. yeah for you. honestly."
741.0,Provider,yeah so.
16045.0,Patient,"I think, since i've been in the Program. it's been my mind hasn't ruminated as much you know that I have days, where I do start to ruminate a little bit, but it's not as bad as it was for. yeah we're just was a downward spiral and."
741.0,Provider,"yeah. I understand that. And it is very definitely. to learn the skill to stop your rumination in your. to learn that skill to be able to stop that. is probably one of the most valuable things that we can do. yeah um because. We we have, I mean even the Bible says, we have to take our thoughts captive."
16045.0,Patient,yeah.
741.0,Provider,So I mean we really do have me as a human race. We have. A tendency to ruminate on the wrong thing.
16045.0,Patient,"Yes, yeah that's for sure."
741.0,Provider,alright.
16045.0,Patient,"I did have a dream, the other night I have snorted pills, and I woke up in a panic and I was like oh no I fucked up."
741.0,Provider,are using dream yes. How long has it been since you've used.
16045.0,Patient,Since the beginning of October whenever I started this program so.
741.0,Provider,Okay yeah so what like in that. Six months.
16045.0,Patient,yeah October November so yeah around that yeah.
741.0,Provider,"right around six months, and that is about the time that you start having you see tree. yeah that's crazy yeah."
16045.0,Patient,I mean I literally woke up panicked I was like oh Fuck.
741.0,Provider,"Why, because it was so real it was."
16045.0,Patient,was really what.
741.0,Provider,You feel kinda like you might be a little on the high side well.
16045.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
741.0,Provider,"That is so unnerving. I will never forget the first time I had one of those James and I woke up thought that I was looking for the hole in my arm. yeah I really thought that I had use. Right and I was looking for the spoon and the syringe that was in the House. I mean, and I was high yeah it was like oh my and I was crying I was just bawling. My sponsor I was like oh my God, are you."
16045.0,Patient,yeah.
741.0,Provider,"Did you really. Are you sure when a dream. yeah and I had looked everywhere, for the seven couldn't find it, I was like it's not here. I didn't want to use. So. She got me laughing about it later, but at first, I was petrified I was all that work. yeah that."
16045.0,Patient,Exactly exactly that's what I felt like.
741.0,Provider,"Yes, so yeah but those are normal. yeah those are very normal it's like i've said before our bodies and every cell in them remembers. What we did. and The. it's like those cell memories don't go away. yeah they're there, they are better than elephants and remembering things. And when we forget. ourselves do not. Right I don't understand why we can forget but ourselves."
16045.0,Patient,I had watched a documentary on my drug of choice for some reason I don't know why I did.
741.0,Provider,"Okay, that probably triggered it. yeah yeah. Alright, so maybe we don't want to watch documentaries."
16045.0,Patient,"I mean it did remind me how bad it was but i'm sure in the back of my mind, I was part of me, this was thinking there's a good side I don't know so."
741.0,Provider,"yeah because. People romanticize it. yeah every time. Okay. So Well now, you know what why your new trigger is."
16045.0,Patient,Oh yeah yeah.
741.0,Provider,"yeah that I mean that's one of the things that. We can trigger all that mess to come about. So all right so i'm going to send you and I think i'm going to hold off on that worksheet for planning your relapse planning. Okay, and i'll just let you deal with the the goodbye letter. Okay, and. Information on grief. Okay, and those worksheets. Okay, as that way I don't want to overload you, you know. And so, how was new year's worth it."
16045.0,Patient,"No new years wasn't too bad actually I just I didn't even stay up till midnight, I mean. I didn't either, so I never I never was a big new year's. party or you know I would every other day I was, but like new year's really didn't mean like for someone. Like it was strange I would every other day I do it with a new years will come around I didn't want to go out on here."

741.0,Provider,"They usually show up at my house, because they think that somebody is in my pastor said nah. You know I can't find them. You know i'm not doing it and it's probably some neighbor back off in the woods. I have one of my neighbors has. Young kids. Well, I say young one of them is like a year older than my son. And then they go down and age from there to like high school but i'm like. These kids can do some of the darndest things but they. live out in the in the woods. One of them decided it was a good idea to empty an entire clip. I shut the. door looking for this person firing. And i'm like nope it's not me and nobody in my household. Right you're welcome to walk out in the pasture if you want. I say I said, you might want to check the kid next door."
