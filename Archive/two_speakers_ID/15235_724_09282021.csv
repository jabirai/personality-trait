724.0,Provider,"i've done it so it takes. You know, it took me like 10 minutes for my first time i'm sure, the more you do it it'll be a lot quicker. Right how the gad seven measures. Self reported anxiety over the past two weeks and under the php nine covers depress moods and symptoms over the past two weeks so i'm assuming that they're supposed to alternate so you're going to be responsible for two of those a month right."
15235.0,Patient,"Okay, so now how. How do I know like where to go to doing them every week."
724.0,Provider,So my next my next follow up would be. You should have gotten an email. Where it would be like a link to the surveys now if you don't have it that's fine you can. When you call back in to the virtual clinic which is going to be like your your standard you're always going to go through the virtual clinic you'll call that number before the session before group and they'll plug you in. When you get there. Tell them to email you the link with your surveys. When you get that you're going to bookmark that link because that'll be the same place that you go every week to get these. All right. they're going to tell you to do these surveys before your scheduled group and i'm going to check real quick to see when that is.

Before the upcoming week to log into that that link and just do your surveys, because during the week we. got busy we got kids and all that kind of good stuff. But the surveys, are important because they cover us on a regulation, a standard, you know DEA and. federal guidelines they want to, they want measurable outcomes, the surveys or. Why provide that and the other part, is that the doctors and the physicians. The therapist want to look at those and see how you're doing so. If you submitted before group, and then you know you put all negative."
