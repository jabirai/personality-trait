540.0,Provider,hi Michaela.
12068.0,Patient,cassie.
540.0,Provider,hi how are you doing.
12068.0,Patient,Okay today's been a weird day.
540.0,Provider,what's been going on today.
12068.0,Patient,"Well today's was a birthday. And I did not text him today I texted him yesterday, but not because of his birthday, because I was trying to do something, we were on a family like apple account. So I was trying to figure something out with the apple ID that I needed like him to do something with. But then he didn't text me back so I just like removed my apple ID from the family account, and then I was like you know what. was like actually, never mind I turned off the family accountants, we aren't when anymore, and I don't need my ship tied to you, and then I just left it at that, I mean ever responded so it's like whatever fine. I mean, I should have just said nothing but it's because I asked him to like hey can you send me this code for the ID and then five minutes later I was like honestly like that i'll just take it off and."
540.0,Provider,So you ended up just taking it off.
12068.0,Patient,"yeah so I removed my apple ID from our family account, which was. Sad, but needed to be done, I guess, because I did end up by myself, an iPad last week."
540.0,Provider,i'm good.
12068.0,Patient,"So I was trying to like buy this APP for my notes, but his payment method, because he was like the family organizer so I was like oh like you have to confirm this payment with the organizer and like verify all this was like dude I don't want to ask him to do this shit so then. yeah That was the whole situations offers I did ask him, then i'll take i'll just remove my account whatever. And then, this morning I woke up feeling like very nauseous like I wanted to throw up and I had like dreams about him and, like the breakup and everything last night. And then I had kind of forgot for a second, so I didn't go to school, today, usually today the school day I didn't go to school today because I just felt really nasty when I woke up. And I looked at the day and I was like I make sense that's what I feel horrible this morning. So I ended up grabbing breakfast with my friend and she had a tattoo appointment at 12 and I went with her and they really cow like we're really open today like we're taking walk ins, I was like. Well, my therapist tell me to do something for myself on jose's birthday, so now I have. it's like I don't know if you can see it but it's like."
540.0,Provider,that's cute.
12068.0,Patient,"that's like a very false to PCs and taught to because, like I love the fall and everything about it and I had been wanting it and I actually just designed it this morning on my iPad I was like oh."
540.0,Provider,yeah no that's cute oh hi.
12068.0,Patient,"I don't know if you could really see it with the angle, but."
540.0,Provider,I didn't see it it's adorable.
12068.0,Patient,"yeah it's like the heart made out of fall foliage and it has like the skeleton hand the pumpkin the spider web and that goes, and I was like okay yeah."
540.0,Provider,So you ended up to do you draw that yourself on your iPad or.
12068.0,Patient,"No, so I found like the concept on Google and I was like oh that's so cute but like not exactly what I wanted. So I just kind of took like other things I like like the skeleton hand I incorporated the spider I incorporated and on the original artists picture, who did it. The heart was made out of like regular like leaves and then flowers and I was like I don't want to flowers that looks to summary, so I did fall for it instead."
540.0,Provider,that's awesome.
12068.0,Patient,yeah sounds like I mean my therapist told me.
540.0,Provider,My home.
12068.0,Patient,"And I mean the iPad was supposed to be that and I was like oh goodness, how to do."
540.0,Provider,"Their work so Todd to works both works, I guess, but but it works. And so, how are you how are you feeling throughout the day, though. So I know that you've."
12068.0,Patient,"I feel like it's been up and down like I kind of just dis associated with the fact that it was his birthday like this morning it did hit me pretty hard and I was like wow like. I kind of did a whole spam on my private story just talking shit about him and I was like okay guys like sorry that was embarrassing, but I rather have put it on my private snapchat story then text him not. So i'll be embarrassing on here, instead of embarrassing myself texting him all these meanings because he doesn't even deserve that for me right now."
540.0,Provider,So what did you end up saying on like the group chat.
12068.0,Patient,"So my private snapchat stories, just like most like my closest friends and stuff so I just felt like I honestly woke up so since this morning wanting to throw up and had bad dreams about Jose last night in today's is stupid fucking birthday, so I guess that's why. And then I had like snapchat memories of like last year, so it was like I decorated the apartment and got all his favorite snacks and he hates dessert like birthday cake, so I got him like a cheesecake platter because he likes that. So my snapshot from last year, I said, ladies treat him like royalty and then I put a new caption I was like actually don't do that, please many shit I think it back. And I put another I put like a video of me like singing Happy Birthday to him, whatever and then I put I hope no girl ever curious to know the way you hate actual birthday cake and most week desserts and will only cheese cake or scones or trust ledges page I hate. I know it's bad cassie it's bad Oh, can you hear me now."
540.0,Provider,"Oh yeah I missed that whole thing, so you send your singing happy birthday and then, what did you say."
12068.0,Patient,"So for the caption I put it, I hope, no girl ever cares to know the way you hey actual birthday cake and most desserts and will only eat cheese cake or scones or certain Mexican dishes like tesla chase bitch. And it it's again it's just my private story, just like my closest friends who like know what's going on it's like none of his family or his friends. No people. yeah and then it's him opening the headphones I got him I could last year, like, I took him to San Diego I bought him the. New xbox I bought him $400 headphones. And like I did all the work for the apartment so I made his birthday, a big deal and then, so I just posted him with the headphones like damn I should have just bought them for myself, because I liked them. And then I put a picture of us at a concert this didn't have can you hear me."
540.0,Provider,yeah I can so what what concert was on.
12068.0,Patient,"So we went to wanted over a concert on October six of. We didn't go for his birthday, but I really love her so like we went and ended up being his birthday weekend, so I just posted like a really cute picture we took that night in Berkeley. And I said the way you can go from doing so much with the person and planning your whole life with them and knew that this was the person you're going to marry. Then they turn into the shiniest person to you, in the end, and just fucking leave after doing you so wrong it is so baffling to me still. And then I put a picture of my graduation."
540.0,Provider,So I don't want I don't think you've ever shown me pictures of Jose because I think that he is not exactly what I pictured.
12068.0,Patient,"So I did post a lot, do you want me to keep telling you what I posted."
540.0,Provider,yeah okay.
12068.0,Patient,"But this you can't really see him there, but like he has glasses and a beard and stuff it was a dark picture, because it was like a night in Berkeley who were like looking. At into that picture, like in the red lights from his car and I was really cute. But then I put it's the night of my high school graduation, and he had brought me like a bunch of flowers and stuff and we took a really cute picture like we recreated the picture that we took out his high school graduation because he graduated. The first year we got together so, then I put literally been through so much together and fought so hard just for you to give up and sneak around behind my back thinking you could come back whenever was convenient and I wouldn't have to know anything sickening really. And then I said I posted like the poster he made for me and like how he had a bunch of stuff in his car after my graduation, and I was like did the most for me for five years, you should throw me away in the end traumatizing really. And then here's a picture of us, I Disney you can kind of see him."
540.0,Provider,You froze hold on.
12068.0,Patient,Can you see.
540.0,Provider,"All right, I see you now okay."
12068.0,Patient,So here's a picture of us and Disney land i'm trying not.
540.0,Provider,kissing him. uh huh yeah.
12068.0,Patient,"And then I put in quotes I was never happy with you so none of it matters and I said okay yeah fucking sure cuz he's like so happy and all these pictures of us. And i'm put so happy and I put another picture of us in the snow. And then I put so happy birthday, to you, I hope, today, the loneliness sets in when you wake up alone and nobody's there for you after work with love for you on your day like i've always done. I hope it sets in how fucked you are, I hope your day sucks the way minded when you told me how much you love me and couldn't wait to be with me again hold me forever. Then did absolutely nothing for me and I found out everything you've been doing behind my back a week later elmo tragic really. Online here's a picture of US hiking."
540.0,Provider,For you guys hiking.
12068.0,Patient,"mission peak and like i'm blessington. So I said, despite the fact that I still love you so much embarrassing really I fucking despise you and hope the apartment is so lonely because we all know, i'm the one who made it all. have fun wallowing in the show who you created for yourself when we could have had everything the LIFE you're living will absolutely get old and you will have to eventually face the fact you fucked it all up. And broke the person who really cared about you, more than anything, and truly loved you with all her heart and you'll finally hurt the way I do. And then I said I mean this was the most disrespect Fuck you and your birthday you don't even deserve for people to care about you today. But I know you've been lying to your whole family about how dirty you've done me and they probably know nothing poor things they're innocent and I said that's why you're sweet mom was text me on my birthday and telling me how much he loved me stupid fun. And that was where I ended the morning."
540.0,Provider,"Okay, so what did all your friends say back to."
12068.0,Patient,"Some of them swiped more like damn like Fuck him like take care of yourself today like sending you so much, love today but that's pretty much it yeah."
540.0,Provider,"i'm glad about you, so what are you going to be doing for the rest of the night."
12068.0,Patient,"i'm homework, because I skipped school today, so I should probably do something with school because i've already been talking about how stress and like behind and how minimal schools been in my life lately. But I definitely felt like I deserved a day, so I took it today and then i'll be productive once we get off of this meeting I also like my car insurance expired in June. And I have a new car, so my mom has been really concerned about my loan being like redacted because my car was uninsured. But genuinely I just been to stress to deal with it's, not even a money thing i've just been to stress to deal with it, but I finally dealt with that today, so now my car."
540.0,Provider,engine.
12068.0,Patient,"Because i've been driving it and commuting a lot this whole time. I know, but I finally did that, and I also decided that I should probably move to SAC now rather than later, because i'm just so burnt out. And i'm really not enjoying this job and the longer I way like if school really does consume me and I go under. Like flunking a whole semester when i've had straight a's this far, like it's just going to really take me back and i'm going to be really upset with myself. And at this point, I still have time like even if i'm barely swinging by I still have time to make the move and have the time to focus on myself and school and like rebuild my life. And i'm worried if I stay at this job and I stay having no time for school because i'm already this burnt out. And we haven't even hit midterms yet so i'm worried if I try to stick it out through the Semester like i'm just really going to crash and burn."
540.0,Provider,"And I think when I saw you talking about it, the last session, I think that I saw a light in your eyes that I haven't seen. I haven't seen I don't think I think that it's something that it's a new start for you and, like you said, I mean if you can do it now, I would advise you to do it sooner than later, because if you can do it, and just start this new chapter of your life. Well what's the harm and really starting it now versus putting on hold, when you know that there's benefits to starting it now."
12068.0,Patient,yeah exactly and.
540.0,Provider,So what's the process if you were to start it now.
12068.0,Patient,"So I applied to the apartments that my friend lives in and I did hear back and there was some spaces available, the own the excuse me, I have hiccups I just eat. The only thing is, is that the only apartments they have available, right now, are co ED and I will be sharing a room with a boys i'm like. i'm not sure about that I was like maybe I could do a coed apartment if I shared a room with a girl, that would be fine but share a room with the boy i'm not sure about that. So I put a hold on that complex, but I have been looking at a couple other ones, and I did apply at one that my other friend lives at and the bedroom is like. Or the apartment is like four rooms two bathrooms and then two people live in each room, but it still looked pretty big and like I had my own closet and everything. So I don't mind that and it was also cheap I think it's only like $600 a month, so that was cheaper like campus living and stuff like that so it's like honestly just for like the Semester, for the rest of the academic year like I I could swing by without like it could be fine. And then i'm also looking at another one it's a little bit more expensive I think it's like eight something a month for a private room, though I think I don't exactly remember but it's a brand new complex so it's. it's a brand new complex so it's going to be expensive."
540.0,Provider,"And sometimes I mean, though it's it'll depend so it'll be nice if you have a roommate that you click with, but sometimes you don't click with that roommate. And you're kind of stuck in that situation."
12068.0,Patient,"yeah so he's trying to see like the best option, and then the friends that i've also been visiting they're like well. If anything, we know how unhappy, you are at home, like why don't you just come live with us because they'll probably be more apartment openings for the next semester so in January they'll probably be better options and better prices. So they were like why don't you just like like live out the rest of the Semester with us, I will make room for you in our apartment stuff and you won't have to pay like hardly anything. And you could save money and like get a job and figure everything out from there i'm like yeah I don't really want to like impose on your space, and you know it, it gets a little complicated living with friends, sometimes and just like. My social meter would definitely run out and i'd be like okay like I need my own space guys but i'm like in their house. So I was like Okay, maybe i'll stay with you guys for a few weeks, like if i'm in between, so if I do get confirmed for the apartment somewhere else but they're like oh you can't move in until like. An a month that I was like Okay, maybe i'll stay with you, but until I have a plan i'm not just going to go move in with you, with no plan."
540.0,Provider,"yeah no I mean I think that's being responsible as well and trying to make sure that you know that you can only manage so much of that. That social aspects, so you have to have that space with yourself, especially you're still working on yourself you're still trying to build that. One thing I wanted to talk to you, so I know that you're crazy busy with work school everything like that do you want to either see each other, maybe like 30 minute sessions every week or maybe, like every other week, our sessions."
12068.0,Patient,"um I think we can do every other week, our sessions, because I do like doing the hours and usually I like seeing you every week but lately it's been really hectic. And I really do not like my new group, like To be honest, I hate the therapist that controls my new group he's strange and he's kind of massage and mystic like he gives me a. counselor I don't even know his name it's only been my second week, but the group is massive to it's like 25 people. So in my other group, it was bigger so we would do highs and lows and it would take up the whole period, so we wouldn't really learn anything but we still got to do our highs and lows and like have that connection with the counselor and. With each other, because we got the chance to talk about like our weeks and I really liked the counselor who was in the other one she was really sweet. But this guy like it, first of all it takes he signed on like 10 minutes late yesterday and the group is already only like 30 minutes Where are you 10 minutes late. and its massive so he takes forever to let everybody into because, once he left us in he wants everyone to like confirm their first and last name for like the recording. Then we don't even start until like 715 and then he'll just be like okay here's the problem for the day tell me what this means to you. And then he's like okay shauntel do meds and like what this is such a waste of time like I don't even have time to waste, I have to do this for my program, but this is always a dime."
540.0,Provider,So let me see. Like for my who did you have before.
12068.0,Patient,"I told remember her name it was similar to your name, though cuz I remember, I thought it was the same person and then, when I saw both of you guys in the same week for the first time I was like wait a minute. I don't think her name is Courtney, it might have been. I don't remember her name but she had like red hair and she was really nice shade like."
540.0,Provider,orange talk Tara no.
12068.0,Patient,"I think I might have seen her that I think she might have substituted for my group, one side of his glasses right."
540.0,Provider,"there's so many of us, I think, because there's one name is cheryl that has glasses, I think."
12068.0,Patient,"I don't know what therapists work with Sean tells groups. But it was one who also had a group with shontelle and her group was right after mine and she was really nice I liked her, but I only saw her that one time."
540.0,Provider,"Okay Oh, you have manual."
12068.0,Patient,yeah I mean he's strange. I don't know if he's a counselor I mean i'm pretty sure you have to be to do this job but. yeah so like he's.
540.0,Provider,"So he's like a mental health specific counselor so. I mean, he not all counselors for everybody, like sometimes people come in my group, I don't fit them, so it could just be like a one of those situations, I he may not fit you. If it continues i'm sure that shauntel has other sessions at some point in the week that fits your I mean you could always talk to Sean tellin just asked her if there's other groups that she has that you could switch to."
12068.0,Patient,"yeah I don't know if all the nurse practitioners are super booked or just Sean tell but it took me for ever, for them to get like. Okay, this is her openings these are her groups like I had to go into the virtual clinic like four times and they're like. Sorry we're unable to figure out shontelle schedule will email you, but then whenever they email me they would just tell me to come back in the virtual clinic and wait 30 more minutes i'm like guys I don't have all this friggin dime."
540.0,Provider,Harm no yeah.
12068.0,Patient,"Well, I don't know if it's just shontelle are all the nurse practitioners, but she seems like she."
540.0,Provider,"has some of yet yeah shontelle has a lot of patience, I know shontelle has a lot of patience. And I think there's a few of them that have but shauntel i'd say has a huge caseload she does."
12068.0,Patient,"yeah cuz last week, she also didn't refill my meds right so i'm still waiting to have my appointment with her to find meds that work for me and talk about like. Potentially being ADHD or bipolar anything so i've been on low dosage booster pro but i've also been on another medication it like lowers blood blood pressures so it's kind of like. I don't know something with a p."
540.0,Provider,"Oh yeah yeah, you said that okay yeah we looked up last time."
12068.0,Patient,"And, last week, she was like Oh, do you want to go on a higher doses of boost pro and I was like no we're on a low dosage for a reason because my body didn't respond well. So I was on two different ones until I had the chance to meet with you, and for us to talk about it and then she only refilled the boost pro and not the other one so honestly. me and my meds have not had a consistent relationship lately because i've kind of had the mindset like these men don't even work for me, she just put me on them until I could talk to her, so they really how valid are the same."
540.0,Provider,"So yeah so your brain it's. it's insane what the brain can do to so if you're feeling like the medication wouldn't be working for you. They call that the placebo effect so when you think something so so much it can take over, so I mean it could go either way, so I can make it so that's something doesn't work or can make it so that something does work. But. I know I contacted chantelle before about the medication."
12068.0,Patient,yeah. Just refilled ate yesterday I haven't had the chance to go to walgreens I was going to hopefully do that tonight. I don't.
540.0,Provider,know you have a appointment coming up with her.
12068.0,Patient,"Yes, I that's what I meant to say I finally get to see her this Sunday after trying to see her since the beginning of August."
540.0,Provider,"Oh, I know i'm glad you're seeing her Sunday, though. yeah definitely keep that appointment."
12068.0,Patient,"yeah At first I wasn't going to see her until like the 16th but then she opened Sundays up so they gave me a call because I had an appointment, I think, for the seven and then they called me to reschedule it, I was like. I was so irritated I was kind of rude to the girl, to be honest, I was like. Because I barely got the appointment, I think, around 130 ish and then they called me by three and we're like we need to reschedule. dude like this is such a fucking oh my God, I was so peasant like really like. Is there no way that I can make this day, because this is like the fourth time i've been put out like i'm on meds didn't work for me, I was like what if I was crazy and I murdered somebody because I didn't get my fucking meds figs. And the lady was like i'm i'm sorry about that I was like yeah I understand it's not your fault, but i'm just really irritated and I was like the week that I had just found out everything with Jose so I was already not fucking with."
540.0,Provider,liar already yeah.
12068.0,Patient,"you're I was like yeah i'm sorry this has just been like a big thing and i'm really busy, and I don't have all this time to sit in the clinic and way and. make all these appointments and then she called me like three months later, was like Okay, this is the last time we're gonna bother you she opens Sundays up, can you do that, and I was like. Yes, I can thank you like i'm so sorry, but like I had this has just been such a chore and it's been really irritating he was really nice was like i'm sorry about that I was like no like I get it's just been really irritating."
540.0,Provider,"But I am glad that you're like when you're on there with shontelle maybe talk to her about the group situation as well, so just saying, is there any other groups that. Because I mean I have providers that they'll let you like one of my provider his name is Isaiah he lets people know like Oh, I have them at this time, this time in this time I know that some providers are different, but maybe just bring it up to her on Sunday."
12068.0,Patient,"yeah like man well last week was my first week and we he put up like a word document that was like Okay, this is like the problem this this was this so and so Problem Solving method. And he wanted us all to respond to it and the very first line was like taking on other people's promise. Problems in parentheses, women often do this, making their lives harder to be fulfilled, and in my head, I was like. Why did he add that, like what the Fuck does being a woman have to do with this group therapy session and like this problem. But I didn't want to say anything when I responded, but it did like rubbed me the wrong way. And then actually one of the guys in my group was like because the question was like Oh, how do you handle problems or how do you approach, a problem when you see it. And this one guy like popped off he's like well, I see a problem right here, why did you call out women in this word document like what does that have to do with this standard Problem Solving method. And then men, while I was like, no, no. I didn't call out women who you just did bring it up and he's like no you put it in the word document that you're like projecting in the zoom he's like well, no one else had anything except you you're the only one complaining, they were arguing, and I was like. it's going on, it was very strange."
540.0,Provider,"So I could see that being tough first go at the group too. So maybe it's also try to like give it a few more times see how it's going because it sometimes say we're in a bad mood to I mean you never know we're human to some councillors i'm working human others, maybe they're robots not really but. Maybe it was just one of those off times that it was just a weird one. To have the first one for. So, but definitely talk to shauntel to about it because i'm sure that she will have insight for you i'm just being able to switch groups if if that's what's going to work out. Especially you won't have work potentially so that may be, I mean you may be able to go back, would you be able to go back to your old group if anything."
12068.0,Patient,"um i'm not sure right now that's why I was just kind of way on this one until I actually figure everything out. Like I haven't quit that job yet, but I had been talking like my friends and I was talking to my old boss from SAC state how I told you, she has a lot of connections. And she really empowered me on Saturday, she was like honestly like do it like you know loyalty to any job, whether you've worked there five minutes or five years if it's not what's best for you. then leave she's like it's business they're just going to hire somebody else like they're going to move on with their lives and you'll move on with yours if you're unhappy, then you need to leave the only loan to you have is like to yourself i'm like oh my gosh we're whistle stop. It was like um I was just like catching her up and telling them the situation and stuff she's like yeah like honestly don't even put in a two week notice because you've only been there, once a month you're not going to need them as. Like recommendation, and if you ever need a recommendation they're gonna call me because you already know that I got you you already have me as your reference you'll have me for life, and I was like. And she just really empowered me to like make that move, so I just need to like. Tell them like all right i'm quitting and she was like also because you're still training you don't even need to put in two weeks, like just tell them this isn't working out it's not lining up with my school life it's like I gotta go."
540.0,Provider,"Well that's why most places, you have your first 90 days so and that's both ways where it's like okay it's just not panning out no hard feelings just it's not what it is, for me, I have to focus on school and then leave it at that."
12068.0,Patient,"yeah and I don't like to go without a paycheck so my mom will say okay like even if you do with this Friday, you know you'll still have like a partial paycheck like the next pay period. And then, like if I quit this jobs and i'll have more time to focus on school and focus on actually making the move, so I think. That would probably be a good decision for me to tell them on Friday yeah. Because, then I would be able to focus on school for a minute kind of hone in on Okay, this is the plan and I don't know if I mentioned it, but I applied at like bj the restaurant in sacramento and then they just text me for an interview like open interviews on Thursday. So we'll. See about that because, even if it's not like a job that I love just having one to get out there would be like a plus."
540.0,Provider,"Oh absolutely yeah and that's nice oh good yeah. All right, sometimes some things fall apart, to come back together."
12068.0,Patient,"So i'm just stressed out tying everything up but getting my car insurance done, that was a huge thing also I kind of manifest in money again I know this happened, like a few weeks ago, like when I got all my fafsa returns, but I was stressed about like moving and like money and everything. And then I was just kind of like okay like i'm going to do it again like money's gonna come to me it's going to be okay. I woke up this morning to a $900 direct deposit refund from sykes day it was some kind of code grant or something and I was like. All right, so I took that money got a tattoo guy insurance out of the way and I, my car registrations also coming up in November so i've been stressing on doing my insurance I just knew because i'm only 20 and my car's. That I was going to be charged a lot for insurance and everywhere wanted to charge me like 250 to $300 a month for insurance. that's more than our payment. yeah so I found this place, I had to pay like 370 as like the 19% is like my yearly contract, but after that it's only going to be 150 a month, which is still a lot, but for a new driver, with a new car it's not about."
540.0,Provider,it's not about. I could have the full coverage.
12068.0,Patient,"yeah it's full coverage, I have to have full coverage, because my course and i'm yeah."
540.0,Provider,"And it's I mean it's good to have full coverage regardless, but especially for a new car, especially being on but, having a new car to making sure that liability it's not just a few hit somebody else, or if they hit you, you could hit a tree and hopefully Obviously it would cover that. yeah. What else going on."
12068.0,Patient,"I ended up going to sacramento on Saturday and partying more than i'm used to. And I did kind of I got really sad on Sunday like I was really scared because I did drink like I did get really drunk, to be honest and I don't drink, I think I told you that that's not something i've ever been comfortable with. But I was like you know what if Jose wants to live a new life and be someone I don't know that i'll do someone he doesn't even recognize and then I got. Really drunk but."
540.0,Provider,I was work what party to do ended up going to or was it just with your friends so.
12068.0,Patient,"I was with my friends in their apartment for that friend's birthday, so it was like a handful of other people, I was in their apartment the whole time and, like. Either it wasn't like I knew everybody, but it was people I was like comfortable with like there was nothing sketchy we were literally just like. Listening to music and like talking and playing games and stuff I got really drunk for someone who never drinks, it took me a long time to because we made jungle juice and that had like four bottles like various things in it. And then I had a smear and off, I had a truly I had a shot of tito's and I think like five or six cups the jungle juice. And because my I was like the first one to start cuz I was helping them make the jungle juice and my friend was like oh here's a smear not you can have it. And then I like drink it really fast and she was like oh you're like probably a super lightweight because you never drink like go probably already start feeling it, I was like. No i'm fine and then I kind of started feeling it once I was like drinking jungle juice and stuff but then I was like chill and I kept going and I couldn't really see or walk straight, but I was just sitting there having like the most coherent conversation I was like yeah so. One of her roommates best friends came and I had just met him and he was really cool is obviously talking to him it wasn't like 40 or anything he was just like cool and easy to talk to. So I was like yeah like Fuck Jose like I did this guy for ever, and like he did all this bad shit to me when we broke up and I hate him like I don't even want to call him because I was worried about being really emotional and like wanting to call him and stuff. huh no I was mad I was like Fuck him i'm a bad bitch like I was too good for him, I was too cool for him, I had goals and ambitions, since the day we met. And I was only a sophomore 15 years old, and he was a senior and he didn't have any idea of what he wanted to do with his life like he tied me down and. yeah he made more money because he just worked right out of college or right out of high school, but he and I have no fucking set plans and Fuck him and all this and that. And I just kind of like said, like adjust of what he said to me last week, you know all that shit and then the guy was like yeah he's manipulative as bug for that he was just trying to make you feel bad so he had to have to feel bad Fuck him, and we were just like."
540.0,Provider,"Oh, my goodness."
12068.0,Patient,"But it was so funny because I could not see straight like. room was spinning, and I also because we took like a little walk could just to like get some air and. My friends roommates boyfriend got there, so we had to go get him at the main gate because it was like two in the morning, so we had to go open the gate for him, because the apartments like gated in. So that was like half a mile walk and I could not see straight or walk straight, but I was like yeah guys so. Whatever you know if i'm acting crazy just told me to go to bed, because I don't want to embarrass myself going no honestly like you're fine like you're walking a little funky but like you're talking normal and I was, like all right cool. And then, in the morning, like my sister she was like dude I fuckin saw your snapshot I know like you're probably hungover and throwing up and I was like honestly no like I don't even have a headache like I woke up at six I think I went to battle like 330. And I woke up at six like hey guys like what's going on today, but I went back to them. But I didn't have like a headache or anything, and I was like the alcoholism and my family really came in clutch today."
540.0,Provider,Really caiman clutch.
12068.0,Patient,"But then I did get really sad because, like we went to breakfast after. We went to about it or women to breakfast at like noon, or something and I was just sitting in the I hop like. wow like I party with this people I barely know and now i'm out to breakfast with these people I barely know after I got so drunk in the middle of sacramento like. This is someone like me and Jose knows nothing about what's going on he's nowhere near me we're not in contact like I can't really call him and. Have him there for me and then that hit and I got really sad and I was really sad for like the rest of the day, I was like who am I, this is so, unlike me that I got released on."
540.0,Provider,What do you feel like maybe you most sad about it.
12068.0,Patient,"I just felt like it was really out of character for me like I don't think I regretted getting drunk but I was like. This is definitely not who I was six months ago, before I got my heartbroken but I guess, this is, who, I think I am now because i'm trying to like move on and like. still live and experience life, but it was just the fact that I was like I think in a way, I was like scanning the I hop looking for Jose because usually. When we were together, I didn't really do much without him or if I was doing something with my friends, I would be texting him or he would always know where I was. I was like i'm in the middle of sacramento and and I hop with people I barely know after getting so drunk and he has no idea, and then it got it made me really sad."
540.0,Provider,"Sometimes, when you think about that, though, you have to think about it on his end where he would do and say and be with people and he never gave you the time of the day. With letting you know what was going on in his life, so I think that, right now, for you to be selfish with your time and being able to live life and you're going to feel Gil. When you're not thinking of Jose for a little bit, but the more and more that you do this, the more that you put time towards yourself and just because you. Do these partying here and there, it doesn't define and takeover Okay, who is she anymore it's it's not really bad it's just you're hitting a different point of life too so you're going to be calling the school. Obviously you don't want to make it a habit where you're just getting smashed every night. But for you to have tough time with your friends and make memories and the more and more you look around you it's going to be different people you're not going to see the same old same old that you have been. And that part of life is scary because it's the change."
12068.0,Patient,"yeah and it sucks too, because I felt myself really missing him on Sunday and yesterday, especially. And then part of me is still like Okay, but I really do feel like we were meant to be if he would have done the work. But he didn't do the work instead he lied and led me on. And that's why the universe brought me the knowledge, because my friends weren't even going to also when they saw him they made a wrong turn and had to go through the parking lot and saw him walking in. And they followed him so they're like yeah like it was so crazy, it was almost like we were meant to see him like we had to see that and tell you. Because he's been telling you one thing, and you knew nothing. So I was like so the universe definitely brought that to me because it knew that he was lying and wasn't doing his part and it wanted me to not be held down anymore, and it wanted me to just grow from that and move on. Because I was still tied down to him and the idea of him when he was lying and not doing his part. So I was just like part of me because I haven't really missing him since Sunday and part of me is like Okay, but we really were like on some soul mate like meant to be shit. That he just didn't do the work, but maybe one day and like five years will find each other again and we'll be all grown and healed and like we could really like start over and make it work. But I don't know if that's part of me that feels like that's going to happen, or if that's just the part of me that really misses him and is holding on because I still miss him and love him. But it's not who he is right now so it's like i'm grieving and mourning, a person that practically died because he's not that anymore. Like, even if I miss him and I text him to talk to me he's not going to come and be the same person i'm not going to look at him the same and, like everything is like tainted now."
540.0,Provider,"And that's the thing to mikael is I mean he could have been that person when he was with you and the fact that he has turned into this person without you. You want someone that can be like that in all aspects of their life and all that pressure can't just be on you, he can't be like the best of the best person just with you. That has to that has to be there all the time, even if he's going through some things of wanting to grow with himself and find himself and sometimes we can get lost but. He owed he owe that to you, he owed the honesty you, you gave him so much like opportunity to say hey if things are going to go the other way just let me know and he didn't."
12068.0,Patient,"yeah that's the thing to like I know I deserve so much better, and I know he really disrespected and hurt me. And I think just part of me is like damn like I have to rewrite everything now because I did plan my future with him and I spent the last five years, with him and. I really loved and adored this person like I know I have my flaws and the way I love people is very flawed i'm very mean to the people I loved. But at the end of the day, I really did love and adore this person and like I saw everything in them and i've never opened up to anybody the way I have to him. I never let myself love somebody that way or be as comfortable or feel as safe like. I kind of was talking to my mom about the other night, and I was like honestly ever since we broke up like yeah I was having a really hard year already. Even with him, but ever since we broke up, I feel like I have not felt safe or comfortable because that's he was my safety and my comfort. So now it's time for me to learn to be that for myself, so I don't have to go through this again. But genuinely like he was my home, and as long as he was around, no matter how messed up, I was or. What I was going through or how bad my mental health was like if he was hugging me, I felt safe like I felt like it was going to be okay eventually. But since we've been apart i've just kind of been like in limbo, and like i've been very uncomfortable and, like all my boundaries have just been stripped. Because he's gone and I know I have like a lot of support and people there, for me, but this feels like something only he can give me, which is like hard so it's like a different type of her."
540.0,Provider,"Well, I think I mean, I think you brought up a really good point where he's been your home, and you have to become your home, I think that sometimes we get we get confused and and a person becomes that for us, but we neglect to see that we live in our own body. This needs to be our home because I mean what happens when that person leaves a person, there are part of us for sure our home, it has to be here and no matter what Michaela you have yourself and you got you got to strengthen that and give give that love that you've been giving to everybody. But, especially Jose you need to feel that love for yourself but you're going through a loss and sometimes sometimes it's harder to love, I mean to lose somebody and grieve somebody when they're still here. And you're going to be going through the process of its you're going to one day you're going to feel good about it one day you're going to feel bad and then this could last for years and. Eventually, when you get that clarity when you get sometimes that distance who knows, maybe in four years you guys come back together, but who knows, maybe you end up meeting the actual. That season love of your life and maybe that that's what it was supposed to be, where he was supposed to get you through that portion of your life. Whether or not it was your childhood kind of young adult life, maybe he was meant for that part. and Some people are they're meant for seasons in our life and some people are meant for the whole thing so trying to just give that to the universe like you have been just try to give that over to the universe."
12068.0,Patient,"It just really sucks because I feel like the universe has been rooting for us to like I asked for signs and. Like everything that we've been through and everything that's happened and all the things that i've seen in my cards. I feel like the universe really was rooting for us and Jose just couldn't find it in himself to be better and to do the work because he's not ready to. So part of me again like i'm not going to hold out or like not let myself move on, or anything but part of me does feel like. yeah right now, I say that I probably won't ever be able to look at you the same, and I will ever be able to forgive you, but like maybe in between five and 10 years we'll meet again and it'll be okay. But I don't know if that's just the grieving process and me being scared to let go or if that's my real like intuition, because I do. Like i've gotten all these signs and everything and like I was so sure this was like my for lifer. And it does really devastate me like I understand like people come in your life and not everyone's meant to sit to stay, but to think of him as someone who was only meant to be in my life for a period and then leave like that is so devastating to me to think of him, like. or even just today, I was like yeah like my axe and I was like what the Fuck like Jose is my ag side so weird I never thought I would be saying line never thought i'd be like living life without him. it's i've definitely been on the roller coaster though because, like on Saturday, when I was on my way to sac. I was singing in my car and I was like dang getting my heartbroken was like the best thing that ever happened to me because i'm the I already feel myself loving myself and. I feel so empowered and like i'm going to go chase my dreams now because nothing's holding me to my hometown and I can go live like and enjoy my youth, and all this and I was like. Fuck him like that was his problem because I loved him, but I was too good for him anyways and he's still fucked it up, so you know what things and I was feeling so good, and then Sunday hit, and I was like I take it back."
540.0,Provider,"And it's going to happen Michaela it's going to go up and down but give yourself those times just let it. Let the process happen when you when you need to feel it feel it, but if it's getting too dark and twisty. Do the grounding techniques do those things that you and I have been working on the positive affirmations to yourself, but a lot of the stuff you do have to feel, unfortunately, you have to feel the pain. yeah with the good as well it's like that growing pain. And the last pain."
12068.0,Patient,"yeah. me a company surely ugly. yeah definitely the growth. process is really ugly but the payoff is good so that's what I keep telling myself because honestly right now I don't really have a grasp on anything in my life and I don't like it. But I know it's just part of like the growth of figuring it all out and finding out who i'm supposed to be and rebuilding myself, but this new generation of myself and this new version. As an individual not Michaela and Jose but just Michaela on her own figuring out her dreams and where she wants to be in life. And it makes me like emotional thing because I like never thought i'd be like taking on the world with him, but this is definitely going to be like the most pivotal season in my life."
540.0,Provider,"and change it's not meant to be comfortable. Changes very, very uncomfortable."
12068.0,Patient,"yeah my boss told me if if you're comfortable you're not growing and i'm like. i've never been up to Oh, I just want to be comfortable."
540.0,Provider,"And that's I mean and that could be why you had taken on like that grandma role for so long because you just wanted that comfort you just wanted that us, but now now it's about growing and it's about getting uncomfortable again but. Now I mean you have insight of reading your body, reading the universe, and the fact that you can manifest things into your life."
12068.0,Patient,"yeah I was talking to my friend, this morning I was like yeah like I literally think I manifested money because, like I did this last month and I was like I don't know if I did or not, but I Loki did it again and I was like. damn all those times I was manifesting Jose what the Fuck and then she was like yeah but Jose was lying and being bad behind your back that's why I didn't work and I was like."
540.0,Provider,"I knew in the universe may have had intentions, but maybe Jose did not."
12068.0,Patient,"yeah and that's the thing to like I really do think if he did the work and was ready to mature up and face all his emotional baggage, I really do think it would have worked out in our favor but he just wasn't ready to do that."
540.0,Provider,And again has lost Michaela.
12068.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
540.0,Provider,cuz loss. Why don't we because I don't want you to be stressing out and feeling like too thin so you want to do that every other week or like the twice a month what what he wasn't there.
12068.0,Patient,"I can, I think we can do that every other week and if I do change from my limited always talk about it, then."
540.0,Provider,"same time, though."
12068.0,Patient,"yeah we can do this time and then, if anything, changes I don't want to change too much in my schedule, right now, because. I don't know if i'm going to be in SAC within the next week or two weeks or a month I don't know what i'm going to quit this job exactly so it's just like I don't want to make any solid plans and he's."
540.0,Provider,Like no I got. There so let's look at the night so today's the fifth so we're looking at the 19th. And then we're looking at the second of November.
