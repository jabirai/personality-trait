13062.0,Patient,Mostly during the breakup but. Like a little like okay i'll just tell you so.
527.0,Provider,Okay.
13062.0,Patient,"So, like a month ago. or something they texted me and was like i'm like I miss you and, like like I miss talking to you. Okay, and I had at the time I held up my boundaries and been like I don't like. yeah, and so I was like well what is talking mean to you. They had been like you're right I should figure that out. So, then they didn't text me for like three weeks because they were like i'm going to figure it out, and so, then I was kinda like okay. So, then, I. Just earlier this week texted them and was like what to like did you figure it out, or something, and they were like. I mean honestly I think it's not a good idea for us to talk and I was like Oh well, I kind of disagree, but like I was like well that's not really, what I want, but like like what do you what what huh and they were like. I mean I just feel like I have new like I have too much stuff on my plate here and i'm like trying to foster my new connections here and to be totally transparent i'm pursuing a new romantic relationship, and I was like oh Okay, so you were just keeping me on the back burner. wow until you found something that. And so. Lots click."
527.0,Provider,Okay.
13062.0,Patient,"You know, because before then, it was kind of like you, could you could go either way with it and be like yeah they're not handling their emotions, the best. But it's like I don't blame them for that whatever blah blah blah blah blah, but now it's like. Oh no you're. just being a ship shit head."
527.0,Provider,yeah that sucks louisa i'm sorry.
13062.0,Patient,"yeah so that was kind of wild and since then it has kind of made me keep flashing back to this conversation of. Like a little bit before we broke up, we had a conversation of. them basically confessing to me that when we first started dating. And when I first reached out to them, they like said yes and like wanted to get with me because. I had been like unobtainable for them in high school and they like were like i'm a loser, and like you're popular and I can't get you so they, like me, being the popular girl reaching out to them was like. ego satisfy. Yes, and so they were like yes let's do this, and they were like I figured out but in in the confessional like. Like obviously I grew to know you're such an amazing person, but like that was how I initially. started this. And so I was like wow. Total totally used. So that's been really frustrating and i'm setting and I was kind of like. You know it kind of like. Definitely makes me question a lot of stuff but i'm trying not to do that. I just don't want to."
527.0,Provider,"go down well, I was gonna say any. You know where Where are you going with that, like are you starting to go down that like what's wrong with me like questioning you know why is this keep happening to me being used and manipulated and."
13062.0,Patient,"i'm. A little bit in that my I was mad at them, obviously. there's also mad at myself for being, why did you see this okay."
527.0,Provider,"Well, because you're in the midst of your eating disorder too."
13062.0,Patient,yeah and also like but it's really it definitely has been like. That definitely sucked and it's like wow I really thought that I had formed a genuine connection. yeah my first genuine connection and it's like maybe not.
527.0,Provider,wow.
13062.0,Patient,So that's fucked up.
527.0,Provider,mm hmm. So do you did you even respond to that like. No okay.
13062.0,Patient,"I was considering it, but I had called Emma my sister. yeah admin like. The night that I had gotten the text, I called her, and I was like haha so look at what's happening and ella color i'm a call them a deck whole. notice like. You shouldn't was like they were like mo was like I think honestly like. It would annoy them the most to not respond. I was like. yeah let's just do that also I don't want to put that energy into responding so it's like when when two birds one stone."
527.0,Provider,yeah i'm.
13062.0,Patient,Not gonna.
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
13062.0,Patient,So.
527.0,Provider,"How does that, because I know at the beginning of all that louisa you were you were trying to figure like where are my emotions out with all of this and and at the same time trying to do your you're eating disorder programs so like. And like what happened, like you request you know you had a lot of questions, excuse me that weren't getting answered and wasn't being direct it was all like round, you know around the trees and around the bush is like not even being straightforward with you so like. Like how are you how are you doing with all of this now like, finally having that closure."
13062.0,Patient,"it's weird because I do feel a little bit like career. Of like like I am kind of like. yeah I mean I feel a little freer, I think the part that i've been the most mad at myself about was how much I feel like I have. To like transform myself for them. You can looking back in the relationship and then in the breakup also like me, you just being like. What do they want, what do they want, what do they want yeah. and That makes me like mad at myself, you know cuz it's like and it's like not like. I am obviously countering that being like oh you didn't really know who you were so it makes sense, like i'm not like. But but it's also like. I did do that also."
527.0,Provider,"yeah, but I think part of it, you know, is, I can look at it, the factual piece of it but what's the emotions that I carry with all of that to like not discounting those for yourself like. You know the hurt or the disappointment, or the manipulation, you know, the rejection like."
13062.0,Patient,mm hmm my first it was a I was mad. Which is girl yeah not not something that I can connect to very.
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
13062.0,Patient,Very well. yeah felt for Lehman emulated okay uh. and i'm looking at the emotions whoo. um.
527.0,Provider,I just had that out last session.
13062.0,Patient,i'm going towards the disgusted part of it cuz I was like damn your behavior is disgusting this is gross. disillusioned with a good word. I feel like I just got played.
527.0,Provider,"You did Elisa like that's why that's why you have those feelings, because you did."
13062.0,Patient,yeah. Definitely. Because it's just like. A mean yeah. For a time like this was. Truly was the person that I thought that I was going to spend my life.
527.0,Provider,"And and allowing yourself to be even though you're in the midst of trying to figure stuff out and work on your eating disorder. You allowed yourself to be open and vulnerable to a new relationship disappear, despite the hurts and traumas that you've had had experience before."
13062.0,Patient,"yeah well I feel like I did it because. Like that's what I crave. cuz that's like what I never debt. yeah. hey thanks. Lots of anger. I will say though what's cool about now versus a different time, like our initial breakup was. Like. One of my immediate thoughts and when I was talking to him on the phone was like. i'm not suicidal and last time that's where I was like I felt like all of my worth was gone and, like my identity was gone. But I don't feel that this time. Okay, you know I still feel like. Like I feel like i'm a good person. And I am a person who. gives so much like light and love to the world. and yeah. they're law yeah."
527.0,Provider,"yeah I think that definitely brings up a good point as far as the depths of your depression, you know that happened with that relationship."
13062.0,Patient,uh huh.
527.0,Provider,"which I think that was probably just the tip of the iceberg, you know, I think. The depression has. Certainly, been there, and you know just complex, you know that was just kind of the the final straw."
13062.0,Patient,"yeah agreed. But you know, then that you know, like having no way to. figure out my emotions then and I understand anything, then, and just thinking that like. Their rejection equals my failure. And now i'm not really thinking that as much. Like. I do feel like. A complicated Lee like I feel like. In some ways, I failed myself. In like. I didn't. Like I like I did fill myself in that I changed to I was for someone else. And I don't like that and I don't want to do that. And I also like at the same time I. recognize like I didn't have the. I don't really have an identity."
527.0,Provider,Right exactly yeah like you lose you lose a partner and you're losing your eating disorder.
13062.0,Patient,"mm hmm well, even before that in the beginning of the relationship still have the eating disorder and it's like. When I did have the partner, it was like i've formed myself around. and That makes me sad for myself yeah like that's something I don't want to do and i'm not i'm not really terribly mad at myself with it because I understand that I didn't have that strong of an identity, and it was like. makes sense that I backed into joy, but it does make me sad and it's definitely something I don't want to do going forward. So, but I think it's important for me to acknowledge that I let myself down and."
527.0,Provider,"Well, I think what it's important to look at is like how. What what have you learned about yourself through this. This process to like I know now what I need to pay attention to for myself like if I noticed myself putting more of my identity and more eggs in their basket. That I need to I need to be able to reel that in sooner than you know than later, or checking in with somebody going Okay, am I seeing this or feeling this accurately like. You know I am I am I do, I have my clear glasses on or they rose colored you know, so you know, because you know it gets sometimes it gets a little challenging when you start getting the emotions involved and so."
13062.0,Patient,yeah I agree. I definitely agree.
527.0,Provider,"Now, does this kind of. make you question like how do I, you know, do I, how do I want to approach a relationship again, or like. Can I allow myself to. Be in a relationship again."
13062.0,Patient,"yeah I mean, I think it definitely. makes you question um. I think. Going forward. I think what I need from future relationships is to be putting myself first and to be in a place where that's what I want to do."
527.0,Provider,You know.
13062.0,Patient,"And just be like. Oh, you want to grab coffee no actually I was going to go to the ceramic studio. But tomorrow and then. At least in the beginning. Now I have having that. understanding that. So love for myself is a lot more than that I have for this person at that moment, because. Any relationship and I don't really know them yet and it's like not going to. put my longest relationship beside my relationship with myself aside for. Now, was also thinking that like I can get need. really clear communication. yeah and if I don't have a just a walk in. sure if I if I can't say what are you feeling right now like, where do you see this relationship going and get a clear answer."
527.0,Provider,"yeah. yeah yeah and I think you know I do think you're in a different place to louisa I hope it doesn't stop you from you know, continuing to explore relationships for yourself, because you know I I know there's somebody out there for you. And, and I think you needed this to get that closure to understand i'm glad that not that i'm glad that this happened to louisa all but i'm glad that she was finally able to to acknowledge what she was doing. so that you can really see. Her behaviors and actions like how manipulative and and disrespectful that was to you."
13062.0,Patient,yeah what's. annoying is that I don't think that they see how. I don't think they see it.
527.0,Provider,"yeah I agree, I don't think so either I don't think so either."
13062.0,Patient,"yeah, so I think it was just it what's annoying is that my closure is kind of coming more so from like a slip of the tongue on behalf like just. yeah they literally just happened to say this thing and that's what's giving me my so it's kind of annoying but i'm also like. Not. I don't know like in. The closure, I can only get closure for myself, I can't get closure for the whole relationship. You know and it's like. I do think that they are going to come to regret their decision. solely because i'm kind of amazing."
527.0,Provider,You are. You are louisa.
13062.0,Patient,"Yes, yeah. So I think I will be in their books, the one that. And what is making me very angry is I now don't want to go to oxy but I really want to go to oxy. Like louisa wants to go to oxy. Okay, but I don't want to have to deal with that. yeah and and it's. Really infuriating because. i'm taking my school away from me. So. that's not cool. But i'm also trying not to think about that honestly because it's like it doesn't matter until I get in or get don't get."
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
13062.0,Patient,Then I can figure it out. So.
527.0,Provider,yeah we're So where are things out with school just kind of on a side note real quick.
13062.0,Patient,At my school community.
527.0,Provider,machine well like.
13062.0,Patient,Without vacation.
527.0,Provider,Some transfers and stuff you've been doing.
13062.0,Patient,"Well, my washing or Wisconsin and. In oxy admissions are in and i'm still submitting Barnard and Denver and i'm. I sought to submit those applications and then, once I do it's kind of just waiting. Until. I hear back. hey i'm trying to get in contact with like admissions and just be like hi, what do you have to offer me, you know. So. and"
527.0,Provider,"Then, what would happen if you went to school and she's there."
13062.0,Patient,I don't want to think about that.
527.0,Provider,"But louisa wants to go. As you said, it was a smaller school so there's a."
13062.0,Patient,"lot of people. yeah it's, not even a trance it is literally, there is one place to eat on campus."
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
13062.0,Patient,"um it would be annoying as Fuck and would make me very unhappy, but I would just focus on my stuff and yeah. I mean, I think, also like I haven't really allowed myself to think of the possibility of going somewhere else so i'm trying to just. Honestly i'm like i'm still i'm not trying to think about any of it too heavily because when I do start thinking about those things, then I start to like create a dream future. Okay, and then it's like that's not what's happening, and then I leave the present and I don't think that's good for me, so I don't I think it's good to focus on them. So yeah yeah."
527.0,Provider,"yeah I think probably right now it's just kind of letting yourself do any any processing, you need to with what information you just you know found out I think that's a huge hit to your heart hair yeah."
13062.0,Patient,it's definitely.
527.0,Provider,"How are you doing with all of this, even just kind of what we what you brought up and we processed started processing on Tuesday I mean this kind of."
13062.0,Patient,"um yeah it was kind of funny because I feel like every single time that I do like. I like. You know, do like an important therapy and then it's the weekend, or whatever it would always be in iot it would always be like. After Thursday group that I would get some some intense news is like okay cool every time. yeah um but anyways um. You know, I think it definitely took a lot out of me on Tuesday in like. What is Tuesday. yeah it took it took it out of me but soil like you know spend some time just. watching TV and just. being tired and then. I. Still did all my homework and like I just did it with I asked my mom to like sit with me while I did it so she was just to their knitting and I was doing my homework and. yeah, and so I just you know, ask for the support of like having company. For the evening."
527.0,Provider,"Okay, good."
13062.0,Patient,"yeah and then on Wednesday, I. wasn't feeling my best, you know, I was just kind of like. down and just like wow look at all of the feeling a little bit less worth worthy you know. I think my. My esteem was taking a hit in that moment. And so. But you know, during lab in the morning, when I was feeling like. I still you know I texted my mom and I was like hey can you just watch TV with me this afternoon. Because that's what I was feeling like I needed. Sure, and then my friend Camille called me and was like hey do you want to go to target and. I got errands to run and I was like. A first I was like no I don't really want to do that, but then I was like you should do it, so I was like yeah let's go to target. You know."
527.0,Provider,target always brings a smile to your face.
13062.0,Patient,"Oh was so I went home and I got. ate lunch. Okay, and then Camille pick me up. And we went to target I could talk to her about you know kind of what was happening, and she fully affirmed and was like yeah they only got you there and yeah, and so I got myself a head like a. hair accessory at target and got my yogurt. And yeah I kind of just like started feeling better and kind of like. was able to pull myself out of the. This is a huge thing. Because it's not. I mean link like it's it's it's definitely kind of a DVD in like two truths at once of like. Right, the majority of it not me, you know, like the manipulation, all that not me. Right, but the losing myself in it. That was me. You know. Sure, and so. Taking responsibility for my part, but it's like if it's a pie my parts like this, and then we get the rest of it. Right so. yeah. um."
527.0,Provider,So did you feel like you were able to kind of stay present and grounded and not not check out or dissociate out of it.
13062.0,Patient,"Good yeah I think Tuesday, Wednesday morning Tuesday half of Wednesday was harder and I definitely checked out a little bit more, and was like you know I just need to take some time and watch some TV. and feel a little shitty. But. It wasn't very long and it and I did use behaviors to assist. Positive behaviors."
527.0,Provider,mm hmm. Yes.
13062.0,Patient,"And I am super super super proud, because I eat breakfast lunch and dinner. kind of without a thought really."
527.0,Provider,good for you. I was gonna I was gonna ask if that challenge to any. Any like i'm gonna you know restrict because I went to you know not feel this or.
13062.0,Patient,"I did notice i'm. Either Tuesday night or Wednesday morning, or something I had a stomach ache. I did have like a kind of like an anxiety stomach ache. But I didn't. I still ate dinner, and all that stuff."
527.0,Provider,"Okay, good."
13062.0,Patient,"And I was kind of able to ignore and doing, like, I think that this is just. A little bit of anxiety thing i'm. Good yeah we really didn't have restrictive. Which i'm super proud of."
527.0,Provider,Exactly.
13062.0,Patient,Through that.
527.0,Provider,"Well, but we also came up with your good plan to like you know I said, for us to be able to you know when we're doing trauma work you have to establish like your safety plan your coping plan so like and i'm still going to have to feed my body and fuel my body for. mm hmm."
13062.0,Patient,"Absolutely um. yeah and i'm. yeah. And I have started doing a positive thing for myself a. kind of similar to like my like stretching in like dryness he might have body and like a positive light and stuff. i've started getting in the practice of. You know you're like supposed to put lotion on your tattoos every day and I never do, but like you're supposed to. But I do have new ones, and so they're like healing and I. You know i'm a little bit more on the practice of putting pressure on them so i've started kind of. When i'm changing and getting ready for bed. Taking a moment to look in the mirror and put some lotion on my tattoos and just like appreciate. Instead of be upset but. And I do feel like it is good, like it doesn't make. none of it i'm like you look at that i'm but i'm like."

So you put your your bottom muffin and then you cut the eggs in the square so you take a little Square and you put a piece of cheese and a little bit of bacon and then I wrap them up and I freeze them, so now, I can just pull them out of the freezer. awesome and put them in the microwave now so.

All of the end like you can say the behavior without explaining it to them, you know they just get it."
