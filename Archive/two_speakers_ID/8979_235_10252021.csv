I break out in hives. and I don't know if I ate something I mean, as far as I know, i'm not really allergic to anything I mean i'm allergic to make up but it's not like bad it just makes my eyes watering and in my nose run but. I broke out in hives like everywhere, it was like on the bottom of my feet and I like couldn't walk or anything, it was terrible I hated it."
235.0,Provider,didn't get stung or anything.
8979.0,Patient,"No, not that I know of."
235.0,Provider,"wow well, you would know if you got stung and that happened to be yeah you're what you did, did you take benadryl or what you do for breaking out and stuff."
8979.0,Patient,yeah I took benadryl.
235.0,Provider,So did did that helped it subside after a day or two or.
8979.0,Patient,"yeah I think I slept for two days straight and then I noticed like once I was like able to wake up and like walk that it was going away, I mean, I still have some like you can see, but."
235.0,Provider,that's where to sing I wonder what she did you did you eat anything out of the out of the ordinary that might have triggered it or what do you think.
8979.0,Patient,"um yeah we I got a cupcake from walmart. I shouldn't have but. Because I feel like the last time I ate cake from walmart I don't know I don't know that I think is good, but I feel like that might be what's like. causing it because the last time I ate cake couple years ago, the same thing happened, I like woke up in the middle of the night and I thought I got bit by something. Because I was just itching and I was like Why am I keep waking up itching like that's driving me nuts and I realized, it was like everywhere i'm like oh my God like I was attacked, but it ended up being hives."
235.0,Provider,"I think you nailed it I think it's probably the icing and some type of ingredients that go with the sugar and you know, a preservative to keep it, you know as long as possible and that just probably you're allergic to."
8979.0,Patient,them yeah.
235.0,Provider,You have any other problems with processed foods.
8979.0,Patient,"No. No, no."
235.0,Provider,"yeah well, thank goodness you're feeling better now, so you gave your husband or your boyfriend a chance to baby and stuff and everybody yeah."
8979.0,Patient,Right yeah. yeah the kids were I felt like we're extra good but they're always good so.
235.0,Provider,"that's cool. um. I was just kind of looking at your chart I was curious house you're smoking going, are you are you improving on that in the cigarettes and."
8979.0,Patient,"I don't smoke cigarettes i've made, but I have noticed that I don't. Like because it's a habit it like I usually have to fill it with the liquid and i've noticed that when I first got it, I was filling it with the liquid at least three times a day. But like lately I haven't been I think I only have to fill it once and that sometimes not every time so i'm thinking."
235.0,Provider,"Well, you."
8979.0,Patient,"Know i'm like, at least not like hitting it as much."
235.0,Provider,"Absolutely, I wonder how much nicotine that hasn't."
8979.0,Patient,um I believe mine of three.
235.0,Provider,What would that be equivalent to a wandering cigarettes.
8979.0,Patient,"Well, it says that it's tobacco free but then says that it's a three milligrams make a team. which I used to do six."
235.0,Provider,"that's. Missing not only half, but you reduce half of the half so you're down to like a quarter when this was originally put in your chart I think you know. yeah that's really good What about pot Have you had any luck on that front getting better there."
8979.0,Patient,I haven't smoked.
235.0,Provider,"wow really good. So you're making big big improvement no smoking pot. So we'll have to. Please transcriber get that down that's really those are really encouraging signs so bad here. i'm wondering house, we talked last Wednesday how's your daughter doing. What. Did you ever have to go about dealing with that's probably what i'm i'm curious if. They don't. You know."
8979.0,Patient,"I haven't said anything to her, I just acted like I didn't see it but she's just I don't know I talked to my mom because my mom had like a little get together at her house. Over the weekend and my daughter like had like a break down there just started crying and wanting to come home so. I brought her home and went back with my son and. I don't know we were talking about it there and i'm like I just I don't know what to do, like. may think that it's just her age and like what's going on like that her hormones are all over the place and i'm like I guess, though I just I don't remember back when I was that age like being like that, but then again times are different, I remember being like that, like 16 but not 12."
235.0,Provider,"yeah well, I mean that pretty much the hormone thing that happens at a certain period, you know I mean forever, but the emotional strain of teenagers say that could last a long time. But I think I think you, you know what you and. What Rachel was sharing in that group about you know her understanding it and, just like her dad would be right into her stuff but she takes a different approach, like. You know, maybe not confronting but just knowing letting her know that you're there I think that's to me I think that's the best way to do let her know that you love her and collect you do i'm sure you do oh."
8979.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
235.0,Provider,"You know, give her security and stuff."
8979.0,Patient,"yeah. yeah cuz my mom was more of the type that. was my friend tried to be my friend, it was like as if, like I don't know how to explain it. It was almost as if, like if it was happening to me if they were her friends to so they were doing it to her and it's like but no they're my friend you're my mom like."
235.0,Provider,"yeah that's the two different perspectives right one of over parenting and the other one wanted to be a buddy and stuff and. yeah there's a lot of stuff you learned from being a parent. Well we're doing good I was, I was, I see last time we met was a month ago. And everything else go well, as far as with. You know house dynamics with. Your boyfriend you he's he's a everything's good with this work and. that's okay cool. I just ask that because it's weird time, so you know."
8979.0,Patient,"No worries. I got lucky with him. it's it's like we're the same person, but we're not I don't know I don't know we just. I feel like once we started dating each other, we both have like realized like this is going to be like an adult relationship not like how we were before if that makes sense. Not him and I before but, like the with the people we've dated before. Like I feel like this is like. Both of our first like adult like relationship like we don't run at the first sign of like a argument or confront confrontation. Like we actually like will talk and like tell each other, like Oh well, I don't mind if you go but i'm just saying it would bother me like type stuff instead of like. Putting it in and then screaming later."
235.0,Provider,"that's really healthy grace in it, you know just know relationships are really easy you got to work them out, you know there's so even the best right and you just gotta find each other's company, you know their space and giving them room and and."
8979.0,Patient,"Getting clean has like helped me realize that like that all relationships are our work like it's not just something that's going to happen, like you have to work at it, or else it's going to fall apart."
235.0,Provider,"yeah and I think I think back what you were sharing the last time we met with the. With the friends your your daughter your kids friends that they stayed over her place and the relationship you're building with her, and it was like a one way street, it was like you know. All you know, listen to my listen to my drama and stuff and be there three days in three hours each day, you know that that wears on you know your mental health and stresses you out, so I think you made a good move any any movement on that front, have you you just."
8979.0,Patient,"know she did get Ahold of me, it was like a billion paragraphs, but I didn't read them all, I just I don't i'm not ready to say anything to her yet."
235.0,Provider,"So, like manic writing or whatever just. pretty much yeah yeah yeah you just got to be ready for that being the right mood or whatever and. Some relationships are best at a distance, you know so."
8979.0,Patient,"that's how I feel like ours is because it's like I care about you, I don't mind waving to you if i'm driving by and you're driving by but I. I don't I don't want to hang out anymore like it's just not until she at least does something that helps herself like getting it isn't do something for me it's do something for yourself like that's that's what I want."
235.0,Provider,I think what she needs is not you to be her therapist but she needs to get her own therapist worker stuff out.
8979.0,Patient,I tried.
235.0,Provider,You know. We can do with your own stuff man you don't need to begin with others yeah she went for like a week or two maybe a month.
8979.0,Patient,"And then she just. it's like that guy talked her back out of going and stuff i'm like a. So, and I feel like until she's completely done with him, she will not better herself she won't do anything to make herself better."
235.0,Provider,"that's that's hard you know but it's the truth, I mean, some people are just flat out toxic in your life, you know that from. You know from you're using days and you just have to have those healthy boundaries, so that goes without saying, a lot of people don't learn learn until it's too late or. or I don't know we just hope that that works out for her, let me go ahead and set us up for the next time so we're looking at a month away. Okay okay. pull this up here. Does this time always I think matt might have this would let me take a look what I have available. Is it how's the weather over there in Ohio today."
8979.0,Patient,Happy rainy cold.

I hope all is all the swelling down let's see pre patient must sign an AMA forum for labs before getting appointment Do you know anything about that."
