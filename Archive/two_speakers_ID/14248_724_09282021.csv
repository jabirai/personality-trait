I want to get another appointment with her, so I can talk about that, but I mean based on what everyone said so far here that the only medicine they prescribe suboxone or versions of that so. But you'd like to get on anxiety meds to. Yet right my other issues."

724.0,Provider,"yeah I mean you could. You could try doing that, with her then. Or the virtual clinic you could just call them and have them plug you into like our next available. date that. You know that works for you too."
14248.0,Patient,Oh yeah.
724.0,Provider,"Because a lot of providers, they don't do their own scheduling. So. She could just you could wait what's your next appointment."
14248.0,Patient,"Well, this meeting is tomorrow or Wednesday, but I don't have any set appointments with her interesting by myself."
724.0,Provider,"yeah so today when you're done with this session go back to the virtual clinic and see if you can schedule a. Like a MED follow up appointment with her. don't let you know what. What she has available, and you know pick a time and a date that works for you. yeah wait until tomorrow and be like hey I need to make an appointment with you she's going to be like yeah just call the virtual clinic. At least today, you can get ahead of it and get that day in early. Yes, that's what I would do."
14248.0,Patient,"yeah that's what they suggested, so I brought that up in the beginning on foreign me to the whoever today, so they should come back afterwards and set it up yeah."
724.0,Provider,"yep the virtual clinic is going to be like your primary go to for scheduling and like questions and all that kind of good stuff so it's easy to go direct with them than it is sometimes it go with direct with the provider because. I mean everyone is different, but some of them. Like yeah let me. Give me a second i'll make the schedule for you do all that kind of southern southern. Far to. So."
14248.0,Patient,"That would be. yeah I went to my first therapy appointment, I have one Monday, but you know I missed it, I totally forgot about it um. You know this this issues with my anxiety and everything that's stressing me out, you know. i've been lately having to use my calendar a lot for all my appointments. You know cuz I can't remember things i'm so either busy stressed out or got a lot going on. You know, so my first physical therapy appointment today um you know, I was talking with the guy and he actually was doing some stuff on my moving my leg around was laid on my stomach and. You know, he was actually doing some stuff where I can feel the pain in my back with a nervous like because, obviously, my MRI so first one, I had to didn't show it was impinge on earth right. Right, but he says it can irritate the nerves, depending on what you do right, so he was moving my laying around lifting it up moving it in certain places, and then I will get a sharp pain that's what I feel when I walk sometimes or move. Or do you standing in general. And he was the first physical. Physical therapists that i've been to that actually could figure out where my pain was at pym plan and then affected physically on his own without having me to do a certain move to show them i'm in pain, you know."
724.0,Provider,Right So what did they what did they say which nerve was a.
14248.0,Patient,"Well, I don't know. Exactly what he said he didn't mention the executor but I know it's in my lower back out four or five probably area. that's where my thing on MRI mentioned, but I know it's like it was in my lower back my right side, but he was actually just working on my left leg."
724.0,Provider,yeah cuz because what happens is that your nerves crossover. like that.
14248.0,Patient,"yeah so I had pain on my left leg when the lower back and shot down my side and stuff so. that's where the pain was, and I said man, we didn't do that time, but I want him to do that same thing with my right leg, so I can show them, so you can pinpoint where that pain is too, because you know after I talked to him. I know I asked them what about what can I do for my back you know what's The next step and i've been doing my exercises I tried to work out a little bit to strengthen my core. You know I tried to do what I can in my you know messed up situation right now, I can only do so much when I do my best i'm you know i've been to physical therapy is my third time already started for time and then. And he says, based on what he builds and you know my reaction to what he was doing, he says, you know you have the what you're doing can help ease some of the pain, the only other thing would be surgery, and that may or may not work out right yes they're hitting mess with that. yeah but he says, you know cuz I told him some of the doctors before said Oh, this is something that should get better and he'll write my books this and my tear yeah based on what he was saying well yeah that can happen. But, most likely she's going to Syria and get worse over time, you know. He makes. me that it's not going to get better. And these other doctors are telling the doctor said it is gonna get better so now i'm getting conflicting."
724.0,Provider,issues but.
14248.0,Patient,"You know I felt like I trusted him because he actually pinpoint and me and I felt like he's telling the truth, you know. Like he's actually been on extra set of saying oh you don't need. No need this was it's gonna get better go do physical therapy you'll be fine it'll heal but obviously I have to work and do my things so it's not going to heal and your back deteriorate over time from based on everything i've read anyway."
724.0,Provider,yeah always.
14248.0,Patient,Get usually is acceptable to that same issue or worse.
724.0,Provider,Have you ever been to a chiropractor.
14248.0,Patient,"Yes, i've tried a few times as well, my back was so messed up they couldn't even do my lower back that's how bad."
724.0,Provider,Okay well. Maybe with this with this PT. Maybe it'll be able to dial it in and kind of loosen you up a little bit I always I always advocate for chiropractic work is like in the hierarchy of dealing with like neck and back injuries.
14248.0,Patient,"I like the chiropractor it was nice, you know I mean they did my neck ache did other things you know, like when I was. In a car accident and stuff but back in my day. yeah it was a motorcycle accident but um yeah so I like what they do there it's just you know I mean. You gotta get loosened up enough to where they can actually do some work on you said, maybe going to the PT being."
724.0,Provider,"You know, consistent with that."
14248.0,Patient,yeah.
724.0,Provider,"We mean exercises might loosen you up enough to where they can actually come in now and do some word where, in the past they couldn't because you're just too tired to locked up."
14248.0,Patient,"yeah but you know i've been trying to loosen up and stretch and do those things, so there might be hope you never know but. I wouldn't mind going again that they have to be referred out because I ain't got the money to pay for that. right we covered under my medical if that's gonna happen i'd be open to that obviously you know I do want to at least do something that helped build better you know yeah."
724.0,Provider,"You know it's like anything like surgeons. You know, when you talk to a surgeon, they want to cut you open when you talk to a Cairo, they want to, they want to kind of rely on you and you talk to PT they want. to stretch you out and open you up like so like everybody within their specialty that's what he wants to do so."
14248.0,Patient,we're watching.
724.0,Provider,"yeah well, it said to but it's not a bad idea to get multiple looks right so it's like. you go to your doctor he's like. You know that your primary is always going to be somewhat optimistic and tell you periphery, they have a good understanding of, like all. Issues pastors have a specific issue. Like a podiatrist a doctor knows a lot about feet, a lot more than maybe I do, but you know the dodgers knows. So that's what I send you off to the specialist so it's a good idea to get some some you know. You know, opinions you know medical opinions and they're right, you know, nobody in the situation is wrong, the doctor is correct when he says that over time and stuff can heal you know what I mean."
14248.0,Patient,It can't.
724.0,Provider,"can't work itself out. The PC guys not incorrect by saying that you could be suffering with your whole life, because that is also."
14248.0,Patient,yeah.
724.0,Provider,"So it's just a matter of getting certain things worked out if you can. With a PT if he can help you, but just by manipulating. Like you."
14248.0,Patient,said yeah. He doesn't like i'm in mountain house.
724.0,Provider,Because i've had bulging discs.
14248.0,Patient,i've had.
724.0,Provider,"A little bulge of this like it my neck and. It shut down it sat on my own and nerve and it shut down my tricep I had complete muscle atrophy of my tricep it like disappeared, within a few days."
14248.0,Patient,apart.
724.0,Provider,"my chest, because it comes down."
14248.0,Patient,You know cross.
724.0,Provider,"Are my chest like that nerve me died and my part of my chest like concave here right. I went from being able to do like crazy numbers of push ups to like one day, I was in jujitsu and like I went to I got down on all fours and I tried to do a push up and I physically couldn't do it, and I was like what is going. On here, this is strange, and my arm hurts like I couldn't push anything so like if you if you hold your chest here, and you just push out, you can feel like the muscle I kind of stuff it hurt to do that, so I knew that I had an. Injury in my cervical spine and that's what happened it shut it down, you know my right arm is slightly smaller now my left arm i've gotten back to the point, through for years, it took me four or five years to kind of get back, but i'm still jack. week on this side side has to overcompensate now I have issues with my sacred like my whole body's like out of alignment because of a neck injury, you know."
14248.0,Patient,One thing to think about it.
724.0,Provider,"yeah it's like foundational you know what I mean like you can just get all screwed up this one little one little detail and everything shifts and like people that have hip issues you know when they get their hips replaced they feel great and then they got to get their knees. replaced, because for the X amount of years when there was out of whack their means of it. During the heavy load. For it, so it is important to be consistent with a PT and stretching everything, even if you don't think it needs it. continue to work also groups, because they probably are overworked more than they should be. yeah but none of those providers and necessarily wrong because those are all possible outcome. would get better the surgery could go well or not go well and typically what they say like with back surgeries is. There they're really never as effective as they should be you go in and remove the disk and that comes down and they fuse it that's all bad news, you know what I mean like. permitted so exhaust all of the resources before you commit to that when I hurt my neck again they were like you know the surgeon came in he's like yeah we'll go in, through your neck here back and pull the disc out. fuse, and all this. All this stuff and I was like essentially turned me into Batman be like."
14248.0,Patient,Right.
724.0,Provider,"You can't undo that once that's done that's a wrap you. know just fusion and all that that's a wrap so it's like no i'm going to try chiropractic even if you're going to poo poo the Adam to go pee. theme silly i'll stretch i've had all kinds of like stretching techniques and. But it does help and, over time, but you have to be like super consistent has to become part of like your everyday life. As much as well that it is, and, over time, it can and should get better spinal decompression by version table, you can get one of those things for like 70 bucks. or craigslist and quantify them cheaper. Real simple you get on the inversion table just a little bit every day, you know all this stuff like consumes time out of your day but it's worth it long term. yeah so."
14248.0,Patient,"I definitely want to keep showing me like one of the last things if ever, you know I don't want to have to go through that happened, you can find a table. Where you know."
724.0,Provider,"What the spine and the nerves. And all sudden like like. you're peeing on controllable you know what I. mean like there's like a lot of. A lot of risky things that you that you can incur this what your spine so. Obviously it's important and the medication. Hopefully, like we can get the medication dialed in. I would not rely on that alone you're going to use like a it's gonna be."
14248.0,Patient,A combination right.
724.0,Provider,"it's gonna be a team effort, all those things."
14248.0,Patient,"He says medicine, will help it's not going to solve all your problems yeah. A little bit of everything. that's what i'm wanting to know yeah. yeah I just want to have a you know happy sustainable life, but I want to be able to be able to do stuff during the day, then you know, he said he won't be able to function. of everything, but it helped me get through my day, so I can do the things I need to do is still you know be all right yeah because i'm."
724.0,Provider,still want to quality.
14248.0,Patient,yeah right now my quality of life is doing so far down that shit you know I don't know where i'm at you know and.
724.0,Provider,"that's. A fan of mental health. yeah and I think you. may get anxious and stressed out and all those things. And all those feelings are you know, given your your situation they're natural they're not uncommon. They may be uncommon to you because you. may not have. dealt with it your whole life. But this is a major change in your life and. it's life altering. yeah put it, to put it bluntly, like like it's life altering."
14248.0,Patient,and
724.0,Provider,"You may never be 100% but you might be. 80% that might be just good enough, you know yeah. So enjoy have good meaningful quality of."
14248.0,Patient,Life yeah.
724.0,Provider,"So yeah man like the the occupational work that you're going to have to do on the side for you it's going to be a part time job, just so you can get out there and function full time. If you have hobbies or anything like that you might have to replace those with the. Daily maintenance. yeah man so. Considering that What do you do, for your free time when you're not stressed out about all this other stuff, what do you kind of do press."
14248.0,Patient,"Lately, I just you know, because all I can really do is crying so i'm a pretty much watch a TV or. just doing my normal nothing if I really don't have much when it comes to hobby wife right now i'm just because you know with my girlfriend or my chefs on here. You know, we have either going to the store doing some I really don't have much time i'm always do something around. On the girl or go somewhere, you know so. So that."
724.0,Provider,You just saw the goal is always something planned for you.
14248.0,Patient,"pretty much you know, like you know with all these appointments and having to talk with you know my work or you know situations with all the clans or whatever you know just trying to deal with, to make sure I have money for this money for that. You know I know i'm pretty busy you know and it's just so stressful and you know i'm having a hard time keeping up with everything you know so."
724.0,Provider,"yeah and it makes sense, what you said earlier to about you, you have no like rely on your schedule a little bit more than you."
14248.0,Patient,used to because.
724.0,Provider,You do you have a lot of stuff going on. And you want to stay on top of it so using a schedule isn't a bad thing. You know it's really there to help you it's such a huge determine. What kind of support you get from your girlfriend and she like understanding is she.
14248.0,Patient,"You know she's she's understand like she's the one pushing me to just get on my back, he says, in general, because. You know i've been you know either self medicating or just i've been to the point where you know I can't even i'm at the point, sometimes I can't even walk. chill out to help me get up off the couch you know, sometimes we walked me to wherever I have to go when I go use the restroom on the go for bands, you know that's how bad my back is you know just from sitting up too long, but you anything. That can do cherry or missile my back i'm done for a couple days you know. And I can be like that all weakening you know i'm really have trouble walking and. You know that's just how bad my back have gotten lately and it's gotten worse over time since i've been with show. Right um but she supports me in that way. You know, on top of me about getting my situation with all this help whether it's my anxiety she helped me deal with that she's very hard on me, you know so she's tough. But you know gets me in that situation where you know i'm thankful that i'm seeing in La i've got to motivate myself, you know I mean I had to take care of it because she's right if I don't do anything about it i'm gonna be stuck in a situation i'm going to get worse right."
724.0,Provider,"So she's tough on on you like in a good way, though."
14248.0,Patient,"yeah yeah I feel a good thing you know, because without it, you know, I would just be in limbo, basically, you know. You know, sitting thinking, the worst things you know, even though I do have those thoughts, but you know i'm trying to better myself, you know."
724.0,Provider,yeah what a lot of people don't don't know about like chronic pain. Is he. The effect that it has on our on our mental health and because unless you've experienced it.
14248.0,Patient,Oh.
724.0,Provider,"Like it's hard to explain it's like it's like this thing that is always in the like always playing in your head and it occupies so much real estate in your. In your brain where you're constantly thinking about it, even when you're not trying to think about it it's just there because you're. physically just reminded that there's something wrong so it's like if I. shift i'm like oh shit. it's just there for a while. You know it's like and when you stop thinking about it you're like you know you caught like this trap where you're like Oh, maybe I feel good I haven't been thinking about, and then we start thinking about then your brain it's like oh yeah this still hurts this certain and you're like. I can't catch a break like so I know exactly what you're talking about like I think we've talked about it last time he's like just having this conversation with you makes my backer."
14248.0,Patient,You know what I mean like.
724.0,Provider,"Because i'm thinking about it more and i'm like yeah you. know what like I, I do have like some tweaks here like I can't sit a certain way for a long time I got to stand up and move around, or I or I lock up so."
14248.0,Patient,yeah.
724.0,Provider,"it's very psychosomatic like having chronic pain and most people that don't deal with that wouldn't know. And it's hard to explain you're just like it's just constantly they're like they're like what's your pain level on it's like it's not even about that anymore. Like that that's manageable because i'm sitting here i'm having a conversation with you, but the reality is is that there's so much more that i'm dealing with now as a result of this."
14248.0,Patient,pain level it's the mental level every level of everything. You got to do.
724.0,Provider,"Like my self worth is you know trash like on a scale of one to 10 how's the pain it's like I don't know a six to 10, what do you want to know and it's like how's your attitude it's like poor. My attitude is more. that's got nothing to do with anybody else but. yeah it's just my my prospects. or. Minimal right now, because I could barely do what i'd like to do. So yeah activities of daily living once that's impacted and you become somewhat self or relying on somebody else to just get you up like you feel bad feel like a burden the people it is it. Just mentally taxing."
14248.0,Patient,"Oh, have a certain look or act a certain way or my dad and my boys my attitude, and you know say what's wrong or you know she'll notice something wrong me and should think, are you upset about this, are you Okay, are you still in this like she'll have dogs about that i'm like. nothing wrong. It should because i'm in so much pain and i'm holding it in i'm not missing out. In dance you think something's wrong right. No, you shouldn't pain. My background and I have nothing about you, this has something to do with me internally and my you know, so I kind of have to let her know that you know it's. it's me it's not you it's my issue personally and that's been hard to because I don't want her thinking anything other than you know. And then I don't want to tell her too much about it, because then you know either fail you're a writer, you know, maybe five fine, but you know she's also going to encourage me to do what i'm doing now. I don't want to put too much pressure on her to go in, because i'm in my situation so i'm trying to balance everything out and that's tough, you know."
724.0,Provider,"Well, maybe. it's like a catch 22 because I hear you saying, like you, don't want to tell her like all the all the."
14248.0,Patient,intricate details but.
724.0,Provider,"Then she feels some kind of way because you're somewhat withholding. Your issue so maybe find find like a common ground and conversation and just be like look like be like I love you I appreciate everything you do for me. And all that kind of stuff and. be like this relationship is stable. No complaints like looking elsewhere i'd be like I got no complaints in my. Food looks like it's different it's never about you unless obviously unless they say something like like. Like off off character, or whatever, but but i'm dealing with chronic like pain and that's not all the time. Like, what do you got it comes in waves. And sometimes my disposition. will reflect that. But it's never anything about. just trying to manage. This and sometimes it's really hard and sometimes it's not."
14248.0,Patient,Which is why.
724.0,Provider,"It seems like my boot up in doubt be like but it's not that i'm unhappy with you, or the situation in that instance like dealing with like my own frustration, because my body isn't working I wanted. You know so. You know well, maybe reassure you know how women get you know women. feel like."
14248.0,Patient,You know.
724.0,Provider,"If you're not sharing your emotions you're withholding. That they did and, and that makes them feel some kind of way, and you have this. All only problem that he falls out of that. So just trying to be up front with her. Really leading how much you appreciate it like what she does for you and makes you feel some kind of way sometimes that you need her to. Like do all this stuff and you wish. It wasn't like that, but."
14248.0,Patient,It is what it is yeah.
724.0,Provider,"let her know that you appreciate, like everything that she does for you and that'll probably relief something like the that secondary stress that you're dealing with."
14248.0,Patient,Because.
724.0,Provider,"It definitely has like an impact on people's relationships when. He is involved, because they can't they don't know exactly how much pain you're dealing with. Even if they did they probably want to understand because you've been dealing with for so long. And they can't fix it. Either so there's a lot of helplessness on their side or. anything like that so. Again, be this be up front with them. and be objective and then you know recognize their emotions that the whole deal too because you're not doing this by yourself, you know I mean. You were like it we'd all be struggling. So we definitely need our people to. be on the same page."
14248.0,Patient,"Exactly and that's a good point you know I try to do that, and I do try to reassure her and things, and you know. So I gotta be upfront about it as well and continue, you know work on that too, because sometimes I get my moves on snap and you know. Just know I just sometimes I just can't help a little bit and she's like that, too, so we have the ability to bump heads with them, I got to reassure myself hey you know there's no need to escalate thing you know just keep it here bring it back down here, you know. To us, you know it's unfortunate I have my situation you know my own problems she has hers as well, and we got to find that middle ground and keep up keep it at bay high level. You know. I got other you know issues today, you know you know some of my close friends passed away and years ago, and you know, like, I was the other day, when I was at work. I was actually working right before I got. temporarily suspended due to my background situation. You know, a few days before that you know, I was towards the end of my shift work and I seen somebody that look like one of my best friends like my brother my brother passed away. But I seen someone that looked like his brother, you know just reminded me of you know, one of my best friends that you know ended up dying. And you know I started crying at work, you know just i'm supposed to talk to people, you know um so and then. You know, he dealt with actually an overdose situation they said it was a brain aneurysm parents kind of lied to me because they didn't want me to know what really happened, so I found out that it was actually the overdose. yeah so you know just seeing some someone that looked like your brother wasn't him, but just you know that brought on oh series issues, and you know you know that's hard, because I couldn't work. out for like an hour just trying to keep myself from you know token up every time I open mouth, you know."
724.0,Provider,What sounds like you have unresolved. grief for your for your best friend is passing.
14248.0,Patient,"yeah i've been you know and another accident, you know, had another close friend, you know passed away. You know, was in the car with him me and another friend and that was another situation so and he died within like two years of that you know so i've had close friends passed away. due to accidents and different cases and you know, I have a lot going on not just my pants have no other issues, every time again, a car. You know or come across a railroad track every time I see a BMW or motorcycle I think about all the accidents i've been through, and you know things of that nature, and you know it makes life tough every day right."
724.0,Provider,"So what you're dealing with is unresolved grief from trauma. which sounds like, and I can diagnose you like loosely you know, like I would always recommend that you speak with a like a mental health provider for. An assessment for ptsd potentially so post traumatic stress."
14248.0,Patient,Which is a.
724.0,Provider,"Natural response to traumatic like. events. You don't like what's happening is that you experienced an event, you know it. Would they would call like an emergent event there's my a period where you went through some denial, where you don't want to talk about it. You just want to bury it down try to avoid it so there's one state attached to it."
14248.0,Patient,And then.
724.0,Provider,"What you'll have is. triggers so. See. You know if you see a certain car if you see a certain place or you hear a certain song it. triggered into the event, and you can. You start reliving some of that event create. Your brand and maybe even hallucinating to a certain point if it's really right. yeah so then there's spectrums of. You know, have that disorder. You know nightmares. intrusive thoughts all those things that exist man, so you should probably be evaluated for that."
14248.0,Patient,Is that from like a psychiatrist.
724.0,Provider,yeah yeah you wouldn't need like a like a license like minimal like masters level clinician and Doc the assessment anya.
14248.0,Patient,"yeah cuz that's what I was doing with this whole therapy, because I first seen the psychiatrists here, I was my first appointment with anybody was actually the psychiatrists and that's the whole reason not just my pain, but there's other issues white sheet out therapy and appreciate. means to be part of it."
724.0,Provider,Right.
14248.0,Patient,"The reason i'm doing this with the pain is this program for psychiatry to do my anxiety, often the pain well. So that's why I was originally here, not about pain, even though that's something I need to take care of just happened to work out."
724.0,Provider,"Yes, you have co occurring issues. And you and I can look like I know a lot about ptsd and trauma and grief response OPS held in all those areas, and we could talk about I just can't give you a diagnosis of."
14248.0,Patient,"come to a psychiatrist so me up. I don't know, am I supposed to see a psychiatrist more than just that initial assessment she did."
724.0,Provider,"You could always make more appointments. You know I mean look if you feel like you need, because this is. You know this is your therapy. So there's no real hard and fast protocol, where, if you really impatient like your scheduled your day with this be mapped out for you, based on your. needs like boom boom boom boom, but because this is outpatient and what what you would call like like lowest level of care, meaning that. When you come to us, or to like the providers with your issues. You seek out like the appointments and the measures and means. And if I think, because the theory is is that at this level everything else should be going well enough to where you are in constant supervision you don't need 24 hour medical surveillance or."
14248.0,Patient,intervention.
724.0,Provider,"You know, those are higher levels of care. If you're functioning society and people work and they have relationships and they pay the rent. This is like a level of care, you know it's outpatient or. it's like I manage. My day to day life pretty well I. just need a little bit of extra and that's what I do."
14248.0,Patient,You know this is a full time commitment.
724.0,Provider,"add these things that are going on, and you have these concerns. I encourage you to like seek it out within this age. We have the staff and the talent, to do all these things you just need to seek it out, so if you want to talk to you know it's like I just about additional assessments. When you call the virtual clinic ask them be like can I get an appointment with another therapist or psychiatrist because I need to do xyz and if they're like no talk to your counselor, then I will put an inquiry and I don't get it done."
14248.0,Patient,"yeah because i'm you know I talked to a psychiatrist I don't know if they were supposed to subscribe medicine, but they referred me to share or children. And she said she was supposed to prescribe but we didn't get a chance to deal with the anxiety pain, was the first thing that came up during that time, so I don't know i'm sure Chicago I mean. Another one. As well as I felt like. Well, she do that."
724.0,Provider,She might be able to do both okay.
14248.0,Patient,So she.
724.0,Provider,She might be able to do both a lot of our providers can do both so.
14248.0,Patient,"What the diagnosis that's why i'm saying cuz you know if that's not my should be diagnosed with that way I can get the proper counter these other channels, then that should be something that I probably should do right."
724.0,Provider,Right yeah and it she she may be able to do the diagnosis to i'm not sure what her if she's like a medical doctor i'm sure medical doctors could probably do it. But essentially. Like you need the assessment.
14248.0,Patient,So. that's reason psychiatry appointment to get assess. selected hey you have this or this natural yeah that's all point.
724.0,Provider,But some are multi multi.
14248.0,Patient,Like prudential.
724.0,Provider,"The doctor that idea what she's, not even a doctor she's a psych nurse practitioner. The masters level practitioner she's just just a hair on their what like a doctorate level, you know professional is and she could make the diagnosis, you know what I mean, so it was within her scope to do that and sharing might be the same, I don't i've never met Sharon and I don't. work directly with her. But that might be what her background is. Too so she's number one stop shop point you in the right direction for that. But as far as. The grief counseling. And, like the day to day working. Sorry coping skills and all that kind of stuff you and I can do like we can do that, like that's not the issue but."
14248.0,Patient,yeah.
724.0,Provider,"You definitely you should definitely be evaluated for that, because. If you're having. All these symptoms. Either I mean it would make sense to at least get it cleared up, if one or the other. But traumatic experiences, by and large, will leave lifetime for lifelong impacts on us. And if we. address them sooner they will cause issues way down the road that really difficult to manage. When you have all this other life stuff going on, too, so."
14248.0,Patient,yeah.
724.0,Provider,"You know if you are having these triggers and it sounds like you are. And it would make sense, based on like based on the history yeah you're going to want to talk about these things and we're going to want to create like a safe space to do that, where you're you can start feeling vulnerable, you can start identifying these things that really get to you. Even if even that they were that important. Just through conversation we will discover how important they are or how."
14248.0,Patient,"yeah because I. To myself, for the most part, you know i've opened up here and there about it with some friends and family but it's very rare. And you know I suppress a lot of it, I try to forget it and put it somewhere in the back of my head and boom some like seeing some of that you know resembles driving him family members, you know it just boom I didn't even expect to start crying or choking up. You know."
724.0,Provider,"It just lets you know how. It just lets you know how. unprepared, you are when it comes to that subject matter because. it's been prayed for so long that you just like. If I don't have to think about it, I won't think about it i'm really good at putting stuff in a safe and keeping it locked but every once in a while you're going to get triggered. And you're not going to have the the skills to deal with that. How long ago did. Your friend past."
14248.0,Patient,i'm saying let's see we're in 21 2015 the beginning. Now. You know another one of my friends passed the one with the car accident when he died that was me in the car that was.
724.0,Provider,"21. So you're looking at within about two years. To significant major life events life changing events that you probably haven't dealt with. Because you haven't talked with anybody about it, you haven't allowed yourself to feel that, because the weight is too heavy so you just bury it and I bet you've avoided family members and avoided this subject like like the plague."
14248.0,Patient,"we're not hanging out. With those people. Friends of friends friends. People. partying drinking. You know. More from my life, but just being around that. Because."
724.0,Provider,"Yes, and it sounds like you probably you probably isolated to avoid dealing with the emotions because you're just not equipped to deal with it. And oftentimes we're not like nobody nobody has you know coping skills or strategies to deal with a traumatic event like a car accident that that takes a love what's life like it's not like you get to prepare for something like that just something that happens at random. And now you're left with a fallout University of life, dealing with it."
14248.0,Patient,and
724.0,Provider,"If you don't deal with it, it will deal with you. And it's always negative right has anybody ever talked to you about like the stages of grief. Alright well i'll tell you a quick there's. The first stage is is excuse like up could dress i've been sick for like. A week and a half, I feel like i'm underwater. So the first stage is denial right so when the event happens we're just like I we are brain can't process it quick enough that they can't process the personality of the thoughts, so we just like that's not possible, I just talked to him."
14248.0,Patient,yesterday.
724.0,Provider,"We just had a conversation everything was cool it's like that and that's the brain trying to protect you from the fidelity of somebody be gone, because you just like that's not possible, so your brain denies it that stage, typically last. A short about a time because you eventually. come out of it because you're just like you saw at the process everything else that's going on in life around you when you're like this is all reality, but that one thing isn't your brain quickly will. will just be like it's it is what it is and then eventually like the denial turns into like the like the like the shock of it you're just like yeah I can't please God it's crazy. crazy and then you're stuck with like like that, like that reaction for a while, because your brain is this like it's going to take a while, for you to get through to that stage eventually gets like. Reality sets in and you're just like Okay, so the next stage is."
14248.0,Patient,"A quick question on that. First. person personally. Other one. I was literally he was driving a car crash. The car flipped a few times. Find found his body. In the backseat you should catch the car signs. Because. it's. so fast we're going. So you know finding his body and they've been unresponsive having a call an ambulance and all that that really affected nico's he went to the sunroom is 420 pounds. And you know he went straight to the sunroof and then he didn't have a scratch on them, so you know I found it hard to believe that. At the time I didn't know when he passed right obviously no one went to the sun reflects on my two cents in my own, you know situation after the fact, you know, so you know I that's how I ended up finding him like 20 to 50 yards away from the car, you know but."
724.0,Provider,It yep so.
14248.0,Patient,"Unbelievable you know how you could just go scratch, you know anything."
724.0,Provider,yeah and that's the that's still like the denial stage where you're just. Like I can't believe that that's how it happened. yeah you braid can't. It can't process that information because it doesn't make sense. yeah and that that detail made never makes sense to you.
14248.0,Patient,You know.
724.0,Provider,"Maybe you don't have maybe we don't have like a like a firm understanding of physics that. angle and all the like all these little intricacies where it's just like. it's just crazy, but I bet you like. Like a NASA scientists could probably explain. what's happening. Like okay it's still seems crazy to me but. Right. So then you'll you'll fall to the fault, the next stage is. Now, a lot of these stages always have to be linear which fall like step 12345. Like you cycle, like all over the place, eventually, but you will experience live in a typical pattern right."
14248.0,Patient,But I can have one stage or one time different time.
724.0,Provider,"Right so, then the next stage is typically the the the bartering stage right and it's like the the woulda coulda shoulda stage where it's like. You know if I if i'd win five minutes, this one of the happen if I just stay home that night just wouldn't happen or if I was there to ship what happened all these things. And it's that plays into like your brain trying to make sense of the denial state or just like it's not possible, I could have I could averted this one that and. So again, eventually you'll move out of that stage that that stage last a little bit and everybody's subjective so can last longer unless you were. Obviously, the more the more traumatic experiences that you've had, especially with death, the faster, you can process these events, because you just like boom boom i've done this time, so I guess. But the first few always the toughest right. yeah it become like your baseline for how you're going to respond. So then, after the bargaining stage will fall into like the anger stage, you know. So they're real close where you're just like. This is bullshit on mad Why did he do this to. me you better and you're just angry you're angry about the loss to trying to cope. you'll stay there for a little bit, and then the next stage is the depression stage."
14248.0,Patient,And this.
724.0,Provider,"Is a for a long time, because no matter what you do. don't bother you know hurt somebody that looks familiar it'd be hard to talk to so and so's mom or their brother. Because he just depressed that you're guided by you finally move past the denial and the barter and sage but they always just kind of like an accordion kind of fold into that that the person stage you're feeling like crap. Then you'll have glimpses where you don't get angry and then. You go back to me and said you'll you'll have that moment where you're like I still can't believe it's been."
14248.0,Patient,Two years.
724.0,Provider,"And then the sadness so you'll hang out there for a long time. And you can. You can stay there forever if you don't start dealing with it, and when I say deal with it is like confronting like those demons. talking to that brother talking about that person out loud, instead of just having it in your head and we lived experience of talking to your significant other whatever it is even just grabbed the dog's face it was just like so and so was was it was a good friend to make. This game at out sometimes."
14248.0,Patient,It is.
724.0,Provider,"soul crushing right is happening here at Sony learn humans learn a handful of ways we learned through visual. Something we're like okay we've learned through calisthenics like doing something writing it down hearing it so say you hear it you're like oh OK, and then repetition. But when you have a conversation with yourself your inner voice sounds nothing like your outside voice. that's why like we leave a voicemail on somebody answering machine you hear it you're like okay that's what I sound like. The conversation you think you have in your head is very one sided. By saying it out loud now as you hear it, so you kind of reinforced, a way of learning. yeah we went auditory and it came right back oh wow saying it out loud makes it. seem more real than we just being like now that didn't happen right. yeah gotta do that gosh talk about it and that's why like talk therapy what i'm not a counselor or with it's another friend or whatever just talking about it eventually takes that sting away. It takes a little while. yeah you gotta get you have to get good at talking about it, without falling apart as well. But eventually you do it enough, and you stayed disciplined enough, you can come to grips with the loss and that takes you to the final stage and the final stages. Is that acceptance. def the fact that your dog isn't here anymore you accept a lot of things. You never fully embrace. The last as a whole, you never forget about it, but over time you're able to have the conversation and look back fondly. On experiences that you might have had the person versus. Just a car accident, because right now the only thing that when you think about that friend of yours, probably. i'll assume you think about the car accident you thinking about that night you think about finding him, you think about all those things those really intrusive thoughts, a real negative shit. That relationship ended is what will hold on to for a long time. The reality is that you probably had a. Real fruitful relationship with that. person for a long time, but it's hard to see that, right now, when you're in that fog. And the only way to get out of that fog is talking about the event trying to work through the event. Playing over getting past the would have could have should is. Because the reality is unless you have a time machine you're not going to change it, you know. It is what it is, so you start accepting those little details."
14248.0,Patient,"The anger, except that."
724.0,Provider,"You accept the denial you accepted bartering and you'll accept the depression and eventually does except the entire process and just move forward, but there is no timeline for it and it's definitely longer if you've never talked about it, so I said tell people like you ever like. yourself cooking. I get like one of those first degree burns, will they stay like like hell right what's, the first thing that we do what we get burned in the kitchen."
14248.0,Patient,Call. i'm.
724.0,Provider,"Mostly like cold water like I feel so good right and it feels good when the water is running. But when you take your head out. Now, what do we do like I don't like that cold water. Reality is that a first degree burn by experience takes about 30 minutes for the pain and subside, but if you put your hand on that water you'll turn that 30 minutes to 45 to an hour. Two hours you know what I need so and that's that's like a metaphor for life man sometimes where it's just like you just prolonging the pain, whereas if you just deal with the pain."
14248.0,Patient,For 30 minutes.
724.0,Provider,"It will eventually go away and then you can get on with the rest of your day I work in restaurants, I get burned all the time. of initial you do this and that it's like I gotta get back to work, like I can't I can't sit her all night and on the water, because I don't want to feel the pain. that's that's a metaphor for life, you have to deal with the pain when it happens as it's happening and learn to accept it, and then you get all the rest, your life, then yeah. But those are the five core stages of grief i'm sure other people add stuff to it, but essentially it's to deny it you're trying to barter with it. you're angry about it or sad about where to accepted of just cycle through the status and the only thing that really helps that is time. And the ability to communicate with people about the. medication like anything else only goes so far. So that can't be the answer for everything, putting a bandaid on a gunshot wound is not the answer for everything. We do have to talk about your feelings and for guys it's tough. You were raised to be stoic and all that kind of bullshit but find somebody that's connected to the to the event and then talk about it because it'll it'll free, you have a lot of burden. When you have to do, mad because you can't live your life try to avoid trade tracks trying to avoid BMW that's not that's not a healthy way of living."
14248.0,Patient,And you know go through it every day or just go outside so. he's getting in a car can be an issue of. Not being in control what someone drive so right now it's hard.
724.0,Provider,"yep and you can't if the if the shoes, on the other foot you wouldn't want your friend. To be living that kind of life. And i'm sure he wouldn't want to live in that kind of life, like I wouldn't want to put that on anybody if something traumatic happened to me. It was outside of people's control. it's not fair, life is unfair, a lot of times. But you still going to live your life you can't live in a whole know and and therefore the world man like I wouldn't want that. So. journaling helps. You know if you're not ready to talk about it, writing it out like I said kinesthetic learning right, so if you're not ready to talk about it or hear about it. get a journal and write about it. right about that Nice write about the event process that you know i'm a huge proponent for journaling if you. don't feel like talking about it. write it down get it out there, somewhere, you know you could throw in the trash can and burn it and get that closure to do all those things. But you got to start somewhere and it's really up to you to decide, like how and where you want to start, but you have to start, you cannot prolong that forever."
14248.0,Patient,yeah alright.
724.0,Provider,"Alright, so that's the plan so i'll make an appoint with you. and Like two weeks from now, when you're done with this session on what you call it call it virtual clinic again. it's really an individual session with Sharon. Talking about for medical follow up with her when you meet with her. First off the medication, we need to work on that a little bit more. And then I want to talk to somebody about dealing with a ptsd assessment."
14248.0,Patient,Or you.
724.0,Provider,"Know looking at see if I need to be diagnosed with that, but I have some underlying traumatic events that are working without my counselor, but I want to be able. To do an assessment to. do that. So just give me a second look at the schedule here. Any questions or concerns."
14248.0,Patient,"No, no, the moment you know just faces on quite a bit so. When you help me with some what you know steps I should take the sense of getting you know, a diagnosis, or just with the medication putting me in the right direction, that I was looking for, so I think we're okay there. are no."
724.0,Provider,Do you want to do.
14248.0,Patient,"Time. Do we still, what do you have seven or Tuesday mammals and."
724.0,Provider,Tuesday
14248.0,Patient,October 12 9am okay. Well that's two weeks from now. yep okay.
724.0,Provider,"and You don't even necessarily need a diagnosis, when it comes to trauma because everybody goes through, I mean theoretically everybody should go through the same thing when they experienced like a traumatic event, you know. It would call it post traumatic stress. on it being a disorder, you know, like. So in some communities they're. Trying to change that from a diagnosis to just you know, like a stress event which is kind of what it is. When veterans came back from like Vietnam. And they had ptsd it was kind of like miss miss diagnose because they probably had traumatic brain injuries. Shell shocked from explosions and gunshots and concussions. So it was something different, but posttraumatic stress is something that we all."
14248.0,Patient,Experience our life yeah.
724.0,Provider,"And, given the event like. Like you should have."
14248.0,Patient,That should be a response to.
724.0,Provider,"Any any average person that's lived through an event like you, you describe should have you know, like a fallout from managing if you did that I would just say that you. You lacked empathy and you were disconnected from like the human experience and you're not you know I mean so your experiences are common I don't I don't think necessarily you probably I don't think you need a diagnosis don't know that you're."
14248.0,Patient,Dealing with.
724.0,Provider,Like the traumatic.
14248.0,Patient,Stress from that event know. So yeah.
724.0,Provider,"But i've been through a lot of stuff you've been through a lot of stuff and you could for sure talk for hours about. You know what I mean. he sees twice i'm in I racked what like it, so we could talk all day about posttraumatic stress and work, some of our demons oh that's."
14248.0,Patient,yeah.
724.0,Provider,"that's the whole point you know I mean that's the whole catharsis of therapy is to. You know, is to connect and then share the experiences without judgment without repercussion. So I got you for October 12 at 9am."
14248.0,Patient,October 12 19 i'm okay with that my calendar.
724.0,Provider,"So same shape, but hopefully I won't be so congested."
14248.0,Patient,Like literally I feel like i'm underwater like my ears are.
724.0,Provider,Beautiful my nose is like congestive here.
14248.0,Patient,i'll.
724.0,Provider,be good.
14248.0,Patient,later.
724.0,Provider,"For transcription That was the individual session for Lewis as well he's still having some medication concerns with the buprenorphine as far as pain management goes, so I encourage them to contact Sharon is provider to address that he's also. probably going to need a an assessment for ptsd based on is. The two events that he explained the intrusive thoughts and the avoidance of the details from the event. He and I will continue to talk about grief response coping skills stress management and we have a follow up appointment on October 12 at 9am Thank you."
