16037.0,Patient,Okay cool.
53.0,Provider,But yeah all the patients and me are. in Illinois. Can you give me a little bit of background in terms of your opioid use.
16037.0,Patient,"um I started about two years ago i've been clean for 20 days now, and I just want to continue with that."
53.0,Provider,yeah.
16037.0,Patient,I was looking at the virtual shy i'm supposed to get that but it's taking a little bit longer is that something you guys offer as well.
53.0,Provider,"No, because it has to be done in purse."

53.0,Provider,"yeah this is. Okay, so, so how old, are you. i'm 2727. And so, when you started using was it was a pills, and then."
16037.0,Patient,"yeah I guess I I guess it's been a little bit longer than two years, then, because he had started with pills, and then I was smoking it and then I started shooting it so. it's probably about four years."
53.0,Provider,"Four years okay. And then the pills were just struggling from a friend, or something or."
16037.0,Patient,yeah well it started I tore the muscle mini the meniscus. And I was getting prescribed. Viking for that and then. kind of just went from there.
53.0,Provider,"Yes, fill your story."
16037.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
53.0,Provider,"Yes. Okay, so four years ago, and then two years ago, you were on methadone."
16037.0,Patient,I yeah yeah.
53.0,Provider,What was your dose.
16037.0,Patient,80 milligrams.
53.0,Provider,"80 milligrams. And then, what happened with the methadone."
16037.0,Patient,I moved from Texas to Illinois.
53.0,Provider,"Okay, that was in Texas. Okay, and then, when you came to Illinois. No."
16037.0,Patient,yeah and.
53.0,Provider,starting to use again.
16037.0,Patient,"Oh yeah cuz I was supposed to do, like a was it called like a guest oh scene, or whatever, but they didn't have in so the doctor, he told me he goes well there's an arcane on the counter so good luck and."
53.0,Provider,"yeah. That wasn't going to work. All right, so, then so that was a couple years ago so then since you've been in Illinois. you've been you've been injecting. yeah and how much in a day."
16037.0,Patient,i'm probably they. Probably a gram.
53.0,Provider,or boss.
16037.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
53.0,Provider,And then 20 days ago was the last time you used. So you went from a gram a day to nothing.
16037.0,Patient,"No, I actually was cutting down for a while. I was barely barely even doing a 20 a day, and then I went to jail so."
53.0,Provider,God. So you are in jail when doing.
16037.0,Patient,On Sep tember 20th to October seven.
53.0,Provider,grundy county or what is that.
16037.0,Patient,"Well, County."
53.0,Provider,"Will county. And will county doesn't have suboxone in the jail's yet. Okay, so, since you got out of jail, three days ago, you have used. No good for you."
16037.0,Patient,"yeah, of course, on the 22 so. But someday I want to continue with that's why it's important like that's what i'm trying to do the outpatient stuff and see what else I can do to help keep me going because I mean 20 days is a complements me and i'm proud of myself so and keep it up."
53.0,Provider,hell yeah. It is congratulations.
16037.0,Patient,Thank you.
53.0,Provider,Okay. Do you have any medical problems at all.
16037.0,Patient,um now.
53.0,Provider,you're heading out briefly.
16037.0,Patient,I dislocated my hip.
53.0,Provider,Oh.
16037.0,Patient,"yeah I. got it on for a. While I got thrown out of a car, but yeah."
53.0,Provider,"Oh, my God."
16037.0,Patient,That was in Texas i'm here now so.
53.0,Provider,Are you learning anything.
16037.0,Patient,i'd be perfectly.
53.0,Provider,Do you take any mess currently.
16037.0,Patient,"So I was talking to our hundred about it when I was in jail, they are prescribed me is all off, but they never sent me home with anything so um I don't know what to do about that."
53.0,Provider,"Were you as a lot before you went to jail. No, no. You were you were seen by a mental health professional and."
16037.0,Patient,yeah the jail yeah. Okay well what they call what they call professionally.
53.0,Provider,I guess yeah there's a lot of work to do. yeah okay. Do you have a family history of substance use disorder.
16037.0,Patient,"I yeah. Like my. My mom she was addicted to prescription pills, and my dad was addicted to meth so."
53.0,Provider,we're in Texas or here.
16037.0,Patient,"know my dad's in Missouri and my mom passed away, four years ago."
53.0,Provider,"And then, where did you grow up."
16037.0,Patient,In Washington state. Oh yeah.
53.0,Provider,"And then, what gets in Texas."
16037.0,Patient,"um after my mom passed away I kind of wanted to go somewhere different and Texas just kind of worked for me, so my new fresh start and Sam."
53.0,Provider,"And then, what what brought you to this is this your first time in Illinois."
16037.0,Patient,"No, I was actually born in Illinois but raised in Washington. And um yeah I came back here because I have a son and his his dad's out here so after I left my. Bad relationship, I had to have my son somewhere safe and I came out here after him."
53.0,Provider,"Okay, very good, so how old is your son."
16037.0,Patient,He thinks he'll be seven next month.
53.0,Provider,"Okay, and his dad is in Giuliana."
16037.0,Patient,Ottawa actually.
53.0,Provider,Okay. And then you're in Julia yeah okay. sounds good. And who are you living with.
16037.0,Patient,My boyfriend.
53.0,Provider,"There we go. All right. I will say, one of the meeting rules is you're not supposed to be. During the meeting."
16037.0,Patient,"Okay, I won't leave during the meeting. My bad."
53.0,Provider,"We cut you a lot of slack on the first. Actually we cut everybody a lot of slack on all. But it is, if you read the fine print it's in there."
16037.0,Patient,never been good at that.
53.0,Provider,Are you working.
16037.0,Patient,On now not currently. he's never really been so.
53.0,Provider,Did you go did you go to high school in Illinois or.
16037.0,Patient,I went to high school in Washington.
53.0,Provider,ever have you ever taken of you are suboptimal.
16037.0,Patient,And now.
53.0,Provider,"No Okay, have you heard of it, no."
16037.0,Patient,"yeah I just i'm i'm kind of in different mountain because to me it's still like kind of using a substance that's why I was more. favoring Torres vivid trawl on just because it's like a one and done type thing and, like the I don't know like this box and all that I don't know I kind of feel like it leads back to."
53.0,Provider,"God and and and your the way you're thinking about it is very common, but let me just let me just sort of. challenge you on that. Okay, because it, because it really here's here's kind of how how it works in and correct me if i'm wrong for those 11 months on methadone you're pretty stable is that right. yeah yeah so so here here's kind of. I I hear this a lot like oh it's just a drug for drug blah blah blah, you know you're not clean, you know all this stuff but, in reality, the disease of addiction, the condition of addiction is really is around. behaviors. and treatment of the disease is around. It should is directed at those behaviors up so so what what I mean by that is so, when you're when you're using you're trying to cut down and can't cut down you're. ignoring the things that you shouldn't ignore like, for instance, you know you're missing appointments you're you're you know. No, I don't know why you were in the will county deal but i'm guessing it had to do something with."
16037.0,Patient,Missing court.
53.0,Provider,"There you go. This enough patients. You know, trying to cut down can't get down cravings. You know consequences money you know all of these things that fine addiction."
16037.0,Patient,me and.
53.0,Provider,"So, and that is caused Nina that is caused by. sort of a. deficiency in Dover me. So, so how opioids work is they go to this receptor in your brain and have you ever had any Inpatient treatment before. No, no, just a methadone clinic. Okay, all right. So. The parent goes to this receptor sits on the receptor causes a big spike in dope. And that leads to you know no pain, you know stress reduction, you know. feel high like everything's good. yeah right like even even though i'm in these types of circumstances i'm in a horrible relationship and and I don't have money and i'm project here's something I do it, and I, despite all those things I feel good. So, initially, you know let's say four years ago, when you were just starting. That works out Okay, meaning, you know. You can you can go on, you can go about your day for. For most people, a few months. And it's and it's still stays good, however, during that time, your brain is undergoing some changes. Because the brain does not like huge Spikes and domain. So. Yes, so the brain is like whoa that's way too much go for me, so they so the brain dials back that whole system, so it decreases the number of receptors decreases the responsiveness of the receptors and that causes the development of tolerance. So now, instead of. One bag in a day you're doing two bags or three bags for. Right and and now, when you don't have the opioid heroin or whatever your brain is not making is not releasing the dope. And that is the withdrawal. So then you're stuck then it's like. If I don't have it, I have withdrawn and then, if I if I do have it i'm just doing it to get to feel normal to get about my day right. yeah and then you're kind of stuck then you're kind of stuff I need to I need to find it to get some dope I mean and if I don't find it i'm going to be miserable. Because when you're in withdrawal and it's you know it's now now you're 20 so that's sort of that's opioid use disorder in a nutshell."
16037.0,Patient,yeah.
53.0,Provider,It decreases the domain domain is the reward neurotransmitter. leads to a whole host of other symptoms anxiety depression.
16037.0,Patient,Oh yeah definitely.
53.0,Provider,"That dimension, the physical things. So. But but buprenorphine suboxone here's how it works, and this is why it's not just a drug, for a drug and doesn't lead. Back to use, in fact, the buprenorphine decreases the mortality or the death rate from opioid use disorder by more than 50% and in medicine that's like unheard of. Right really effective method does the same thing decreases more calories significant so anyway method i'm sorry buprenorphine suboxone goes to that same receptor but it's causing a big spike of dough for me. You know. In a spike meaning was way up and then way down doesn't last long. It causes a slow steady rise of domain that lasts for a long time. Okay, so and it so it does not it's what we call a partial agonist, and this is all stuff i'll you'll learn over the coming weeks. Okay it's a partial agonist, which means it only partially stimulates the receptor. Very important. Because because fentanyl and heroin and I see and all those are full agonist so it hits the receptor and boom, it turns it up turns up to 10 Okay, the box on hits the receptor turns into. Okay, and but that five is enough to take care of withdrawal symptoms and cravings and get on with your day. Okay number one number two, even though it doesn't fully stimulate the receptor it locks into the receptor hard. It just it sticks in there, like bubble gum. that's in front, because nothing else can get into the receptor then that's the blocking effect of it. Okay, so if you're if you're stable and buprenorphine. And someone says hey I just picked up there's no sense going off with person, because your receptors are locked. And because of the long half life at last a long time, your receptors are locked the next day, the receptor for like the next day you really you really have to wait two and a half or three days, just to use."
16037.0,Patient,don't say that.
53.0,Provider,"So, so if you if you stand you've been harping then."
16037.0,Patient,there's no possible.
53.0,Provider,"ability. That is. So, so the three key things about buprenorphine and why it's not just a drug for drug partial agonist. long half life last a long time heroin is you know does not last long. Number three have high affinity for the receptor blocks into the receptor it blocks through stuff. And those three things, make it different and then, when you take your medication as prescribed and you're not using illicit opioids and you're not missing court and you're not spending all your money and your you know what I mean. yeah that is treatment that is called recovering. Okay, you feel me."
16037.0,Patient,yeah now.
53.0,Provider,"Now, now the beautiful. This role is a good medication for the right patient. Did did they talk to you about the Trolls in jail. Or how did you hear about the trial."
16037.0,Patient,um my boyfriend he is on it.
53.0,Provider,Okay okay. Now How long have you been on it.
16037.0,Patient,i'm not sure.
53.0,Provider,"Okay, all right so here's here's here's my spiel about patrol. It is, it is a good medication. For the people that generally have the most mild disease. So so. What that means I usually say you know the betrothal is like for the for the 40 year old dentist that gets hooked on you know. You know what I mean. And it's it's usually not a first step for someone with injection drug use for four or five years."
16037.0,Patient,yeah.
53.0,Provider,"No, I mean. And also. The the survival advantage that. buprenorphine and methadone have these little does not have. Okay, so so when they compare groups different people, unfortunately, have the same mortality rate as non difficulty."
16037.0,Patient,wow okay.
53.0,Provider,The reason for that is is that once that shot wears off those receptors are wide oh.
16037.0,Patient,Okay.
53.0,Provider,"they're wide open like yours are wide open now 20 days. zone so so you know. that's why people are such high risk for overdose when they leave a shitty residential treatment, where they don't have buprenorphine or jail. Because they've been in jail for six weeks, they they go out and they use the same amount they used to use and now they're in their tolerance is down and they overdose. So, with a bit of trawl sort of similar similar thing that that okay you've been a bit of a trough for three months, and now you're you're the Trolls author receptor and now you're susceptible to overdose so so that's that's why i'm not a huge fan of neutral. Unless. You know the diseases mile number one."
16037.0,Patient,Are you bear with me for a while.
53.0,Provider,what's that.
16037.0,Patient,Are you like better recovery for a while.
53.0,Provider,"yeah exactly. Now, now the other. Reason it's it. The Trolls us saying you're on buprenorphine for 12 months or 18 months and and you're killing it and you taper off of it. Then i'm a fan of okay they're off buprenorphine fantastic, but you know what for the next six months let's just give them shots of it. You know I mean. yeah okay okay so so so your boyfriend I don't mean to I mean good on him if he's if he's on neutral but but in talking to you I think buprenorphine, at least in the near term again and I also you know you, you had 11 months of stability on nothing oh."
16037.0,Patient,yeah right.
53.0,Provider,yeah you have any questions I have a feeling I gave you the few.
16037.0,Patient,i'm taking it on and it. makes sense to me.
53.0,Provider,"So and buprenorphine it it dissolves under your tongue you can't you don't swallow it. So it comes in a in a little film. And, and it dissolves under your tongue one in the morning, one in the evening. The usual dose is 16 milligrams it's usually or restart that's one in the morning, one in the evening. If if it's too much it's like you feel drowsy or or even intoxicated and then we can decrease it. it's very safe, you know the nice thing that because it's a partial agonist you know it's it's very difficult to you can't overdose on it. You know it's. it's really it's very effective."
16037.0,Patient,me.
53.0,Provider,"What else all sore meetings are in you've been 2020 days now, how do you feel, are you sleeping are you."
16037.0,Patient,"I mean, since getting out of i'm just all over the place, honestly. I just thought I can't catch my groove I guess it's just if."
53.0,Provider,You don't feel great. yeah. You look like you don't feel great.
16037.0,Patient,Thanks.
53.0,Provider,I just mean.
16037.0,Patient,I know what you mean.
53.0,Provider,yeah I mean so. You know that's just sort of the.
16037.0,Patient,Part of it right.
53.0,Provider,"it's part of it right. Because again, you know there's there's a queue with for all you know yeah you know, for, for you know five to seven days you really feel like shit and your and your crappy in your diary and blah blah blah, but then there's post acute withdrawal pause have you learned any of this stuff."
16037.0,Patient,You know a little bit just because I was driving myself NUTS like what the Fuck is wrong with me. I agree.
53.0,Provider,"So that's post acute withdrawal syndrome and that can last month's. yeah. So I think we should get you on buprenorphine Nice and stable, you know take care of the legal stuff get you know reconnect did you know."
16037.0,Patient,yeah definitely.
53.0,Provider,"yeah and then. And then, honestly, the the evidence. The longer you're on is kind of the better, and now I mean to say like you'll always be on it, but me, but what I want to stress is not to put too much pressure on yourself to get off. Okay, so it should be, it should be, you know something that we discuss if you want to get off of it, and it should be very slow and and all of the all of the. Things that are affected by opioid use disorder, you know you, you know you should have a decent job you should have decent relationships your relationship with your son should be solid you know all these things should be dialed in, and then we talked about it. All right now i'm just a few things about braveheart we meet on Tuesdays. There are four different meetings that I do there's 10 o'clock 11 o'clock noon and 7pm."
16037.0,Patient,To 7pm.
53.0,Provider,Was crowded one but that's fine.
16037.0,Patient,"Okay, about he said that it was."
53.0,Provider,12 1112 noon.
16037.0,Patient,"Okay non noon yeah. Okay, is that a year, the same time as me too so that's because earlier when they're like oh it's 10 o'clock I was like well, I thought it was yeah okay so it'll be."
53.0,Provider,"St Charles and Juliet at the same time. Oh okay. See. and I think probably one of the care navigators. Yes, leslie's going to jump back in so so Tuesdays at noon. it'll be just like this on zoom. But it won't it won't be good. To us it'll be 10 of us. Okay, and it's it's really. it's good stuff and you've been in groups, for you know people check in like how they're doing what's you know what's going good what's going bad anything any questions about medications you can ask me. You can use the chat."
16037.0,Patient,Okay.
53.0,Provider,"Do you know how to use, you know, use the chat."
16037.0,Patient,i'm kind of i'm kind of get it yeah.
53.0,Provider,"So if you can, or you got a phone now or."
16037.0,Patient,laptop no i'm on a tablet taping.
53.0,Provider,Oh so go to go to the chat now can you. Like.
16037.0,Patient,"Okay, see it."
53.0,Provider,You see it so that's my email.
16037.0,Patient,I said I do that.
53.0,Provider,"yeah I got I do too. So, so you can always email me questions you know I checked my email, like most people 38 times a day."
16037.0,Patient,"So, so the chat is like everybody, but that that's your email right there, that is just go jackets you. Correct okay."
53.0,Provider,"But then so so say we're having a meeting and someone else is talking and and you're like you know if you have a question for me, you can just go. So you can just."
16037.0,Patient,Oh perfect.
53.0,Provider,And then I can just go. nope it tastes like shit deal with it and.
16037.0,Patient,All right.
53.0,Provider,"So that's once a week for an hour. Okay, and then sort of asked her is going on i'm sending a message to the pharmacy electronically."
16037.0,Patient,Okay.
53.0,Provider,"And then Lisa is going to be in those groups as well. she's wonderful is the therapist and then you know all the patients are great you know, some people have been you know in recovery for a decade, others are still struggling very supportive."
16037.0,Patient,"um is there any way that I could get like some kind of proof of this that I can bring the Court saying that and, like in the program and going to the."
53.0,Provider,yeah the virtual clinic where you were. Thinking to do that.
16037.0,Patient,Perfect Thank you.
53.0,Provider,So that's on Tuesdays and then you'll meet with Lisa individually okay usually usually twice a month. and work.
16037.0,Patient,"yeah. Tomorrow, to do the lab work."
53.0,Provider,"And just a little heads up you know, like the surveys that you did you know, like surveys around like your anxiety and depression and sleep and appetite and you know those don't go away. Okay okay so so please just kind of stay on top of those. Okay, because then, when you when you blow off, then they start to blow my email and i'm like Nina Come on, do you. Okay okay you promise. pinky swear you're going to stay on top of this okay all."
16037.0,Patient,hands are the devil's playground so stay busy.
53.0,Provider,"Yes, so. Let me get back in here. But I think I think it's really. it's good treatment i'm convinced it's good treatment. People do well, people are supportive and the nice thing about it Nina is that you're in joliet i'm in St Charles. And you're getting the care of that you need. Okay, and without traveling and paste we've got patients in southern Illinois you know or there's nobody around, so I think it's very valuable."
16037.0,Patient,hell yeah Thank you.
53.0,Provider,Any questions.
16037.0,Patient,So much.
53.0,Provider,"All right, yeah I think once once people kind of understand how suboxone works. In it quickly they realize that it's really not. A drug for crack. You know it's really not. The fact of the matter is that the the the brain changes due to the those opioids and and this just helps manage those changes okay. I Leslie. Are you. doing great thanks for asking so Nina Can you see Leslie."
16037.0,Patient,I can hi.
53.0,Provider,"So Leslie Nina is going to do the new group. And so I will I will send minutes now Nina. Okay, so eight milligrams you, since you, since you haven't used in 20 days I would since you haven't taken it before I would probably cut the film and a half and do four milligrams and then an hour later do another four. Okay, just because it can it can cause nausea. And then. you've got like can you email me tomorrow yeah just just like how you're doing."
16037.0,Patient,Okay perfect.
53.0,Provider,Now then i'll see you on Tuesday at noon.
16037.0,Patient,Okay.
53.0,Provider,With Lisa and the rest of the group.
