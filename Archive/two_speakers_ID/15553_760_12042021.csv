15553.0,Patient,Am. All right.
760.0,Provider,you're all right good what what happened today that makes you that makes you feel more upbeat. Or did something happen.
15553.0,Patient,"No, not really nothing really happened."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so you just woke up feeling good."
15553.0,Patient,"Well, I woke up feeling tired and then had an energy drink, which gave me the caffeinated rush to get through the day."
760.0,Provider,"All right, but that was some hours ago, I suppose."
15553.0,Patient,yeah that was. 13 1314 hours ago.
760.0,Provider,that's that's probably. run its course I would think.
15553.0,Patient,It definitely has.
760.0,Provider,yeah yeah okay.
15553.0,Patient,Last for about five hours.
760.0,Provider,"Okay okay so so tell me how you've been dealing with the youth, the depression is less than lately is that fair to say."
15553.0,Patient,Say that.
760.0,Provider,Your depression is less than because you're in a better place today.
15553.0,Patient,"I mean, today it is less because I am in a better place a couple days ago I wasn't but yeah okay."
760.0,Provider,let's talk to me about it a couple of days ago.
15553.0,Patient,"um I was in a all right place, maybe not necessarily really joyful joyful but like busy at home. And feeling tired and sat down with my I talked about this a little bit in group. mm hmm have. sat down and watched a Rom COM with my wife and just. Was depressed at the end of it."
760.0,Provider,"Okay. Okay, so what are some of the things that you do when you get depressed."
15553.0,Patient,"lay about lounge and not want to do anything that will be progress, progressive and helpful."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so do you lay there and kind of room in a bank and build and is that fair."
15553.0,Patient,"No, I kind of just lay around and go for distraction."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, and does that work."
15553.0,Patient,I mean it doesn't put me in a worse place just kind of keeps me where I am until I either snap out of it or start becoming productive and ease out of it.
760.0,Provider,"All right. Okay, so what are some of the what have you been learning as far as coping skills or do or do you know about coping skills or. distraction yeah."
15553.0,Patient,"I do know about some coping skills. For me it's harder. To use some of those coping skills once i've gotten into that depression, because I just don't want to do anything."
760.0,Provider,"mm hmm. Okay, so maybe maybe the key to key to, that is to take a day like today, the day that you feeling good. And one thing i'd like to suggest is to practice coping skills, whether you wake up feeling great or anywhere in between sometimes it's our habits, the things that were coming used to doing it becomes a little bit easier, sometimes to to do those. and try to catch that. Do you have any kind of a warning that depression is building or does it come on suddenly, how would you describe that. Or is it. change from time to time."
15553.0,Patient,"It changes I mean some things can just trigger me. Like the movie. yeah yeah. or my wife can say something that will just trigger me. Other times yeah it kind of builds and that's. That I can usually usually, when it's starting to build I can usually pick up on it and just steer away from it."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, and what do you do to steer away from it, what does that mean."
15553.0,Patient,"um by working on, like some of my goals be working out. prepping for for college classes or or anything like that going out for a walk whatever."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so it's only when it gets to be great big that it's hard for you then. yeah okay so tell me about how you deal with them difficult emotions let's talk about that a little bit. Are you a person who takes those emotions and like shoves it inside or holds it in somewhere in your body or."
15553.0,Patient,"talk to me about that because I was taught that was a healthy coping mechanism, when I was younger okay."
760.0,Provider,So you were taught not to express.
15553.0,Patient,You could not express anything.
760.0,Provider,"Oh, nothing, not even not even positive emotions."
15553.0,Patient,Two degree.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so being stoic. kind of thing. that's what men that's what men do was was it allowed for for the women or the females in the family, to express feeling or was it just everybody."
15553.0,Patient,"More along the lines of everybody, it was a very abusive house."
760.0,Provider,"Okay. All right, so. What so let's talk about emotions, we talked about that, I think, last time about how, when you hold it inside that it has a tendency to either implode and cause depression or other unpleasant emotions, or maybe it explodes at the wrong time in the wrong place in the wrong way. Does that relate to you in any way. Okay. So is that something that you would want to maybe start working on, we talked about beliefs, do you do here, the logic that i'm that i'm trying to make about expressing emotions does that be something that you would want to perhaps like look at and try to change within yourself. To express it in a safe in a you know you don't have to you know express your emotions and where i'm on your sleeve or anything like that, but to find. A safe place to do that."
15553.0,Patient,"yeah I used to I used to when I was feeling negative emotions, I have it, I would just dump them onto a journal, and then one day my wife read it and. Absolutely lost it. Because I would write negative things also about her in there just because i've used it as a safe place to vent where no harm would be done and kind of go on from there."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so that's kind of a boundary issue that she read. yeah journal, did you talk to her about that did you explain it to her, you were just getting your emotions out or. Or that didn't go over yeah."
15553.0,Patient,"It didn't go over very well, and she she just apparently had a very hard hard time believing me about it and. It was just a really rough time it took us a while to kind of."
760.0,Provider,"i'm sorry David your bandwidth is. i'm getting a message your bandwidth is low, low cut out to the point I can't hear you. Can we try again. Okay. Okay try, can you repeat that because I missed. Practically all of what you just said."
15553.0,Patient,that's right. It we had several talks about it and took a long time for us to be able to work through through it. and It was just one of those things of. She. She tried to set rules of how I was to Journal and whatnot and just because of things like that it's pushed me away from it.
760.0,Provider,yeah if you if you there's rules dictated to by by your wife than that that's not really very therapeutic for you. Because now you gotta sit there and worry about the rules.
15553.0,Patient,yeah. yeah and it's meant for me. To be able to have that safe place to vent and it's not and that was just a boundary that was violated.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, that didn't work for you up until the time she found the journal."
15553.0,Patient,"yeah because because it was really helping me kind of work through some. work through some things and to being able to express those things and to realize that either I was dwelling on something that I could change that didn't matter. Or that. I was just. Beating myself up and I could in to be able to see it and be like okay got it, and now I can move forward and progress to going to a happier place."
760.0,Provider,"yeah Okay, and did you Okay, so when you were journaling up until the time that she found the journal and read it was there a safe place for you to physically journal as or a time of day, perhaps, where you add space to yourself. To be a large do."
15553.0,Patient,"That yeah I would just do it whenever. i've even journal with her sitting next to me and. The always up until that point, I had a respected my privacy with that."
760.0,Provider,"And Okay, did you did you express your feelings, how did that feel to you when she read your journal, what did was there any kind of emotion you felt."
15553.0,Patient,By huge lot of emotions. and Both angry disappointed sad of her at myself at the world and yeah.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so you had some anger that she was reading your journal."
15553.0,Patient,yeah because because I. felt like she crossed. A line.
760.0,Provider,"So is there any place now, where you could Journal in privacy without her in your proximity."
15553.0,Patient,Oh yeah easily for. At least four days a week.
760.0,Provider,"Okay Okay, can I. Can I can I make a suggestion would that be okay, if I made a suggestion."
15553.0,Patient,Go for it.
760.0,Provider,"What if you were to start journaling again with your own rules, not hers and then. Perhaps create a little ritual of either burning it or ripping it up and throwing it in the trash so that it's there's no evidence to be found when it's done."
15553.0,Patient,"um I have thought about that, and I have been considering of starting that up the only issue, I have no problem I don't like ripping pages out of things, I have no problem, throwing it away, though, once the book is done."
760.0,Provider,"And why don't you get some loose leaf notebook paper you know the kind that you got when you are kid with the coals the three holes and get a binder of some sort. and put the loose sheets in there, so that you have the blank pages that you haven't journaled in yet and the the sheets that then when you're done with the sheets that and had an episode of journaling, then you can just take those sheets and dispose of them. or throw them or or I don't know if you have a fireplace put them in the fireplace if you have like a wood burning stove or something like that or. Even just make sure that they're disposed them in the trash or nobody can see them."
15553.0,Patient,Okay i'll give consideration to them.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so, because that is something that helped you."
15553.0,Patient,yeah.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, are you do you think you're good at identifying what your it is you're feeling like day to day time to time."
15553.0,Patient,"I think, so I think i've been getting better at that."
760.0,Provider,"mm hmm. For example, what do you think you're feeling right now."
15553.0,Patient,i'm. So many different words.
760.0,Provider,They might be failing many different things it's possible.
15553.0,Patient,yeah it it's I don't know it's always hard to pick like the one that best describes what's going.
760.0,Provider,On why. You don't have to give me one you could give me three or four or five.
15553.0,Patient,I know. I would say copy at ease. at ease is a really good word I like that one.
760.0,Provider,comfortable safe.
15553.0,Patient,"Well, I don't know about safe. comfortable yeah."
760.0,Provider,"Okay. Good okay so you're you're good at finding words to you because that's another good starting point for journaling is to identify your emotion, or maybe the. pick two or three of the themes of the day and journal or a period of time that you want to like journal about and kind of identify that emotion. Another good technique David would be to. You could have to journals you could have one that's a venting journal for my painful emotions and then you put have what you call a gratitude journal. That one you might not need to dispose up Have you ever tried gratitude journal."
15553.0,Patient,"um i've tried I try it and. For me, when i'm feeling gratitude, or whatever. I just don't want to there's to journal I just there's so many other things I would prefer to do than to do that."
760.0,Provider,"All right, how about gratitude list, even if it's like a list in my head."
15553.0,Patient,"i've done that, a few times yeah."
760.0,Provider,Do you do that as a practice.
15553.0,Patient,"i've done before, to help me get out of being in a depressed state."
760.0,Provider,And that works for you.
15553.0,Patient,"On occasion, not always okay."
760.0,Provider,Okay So what do you think about the possibility of developing like shorts to be short little coping skills that i'm going to do on a regular basis. Things like affirmations or running through five things i'm grateful through and just. Thinking them. or even saying them out loud if you happen to be alone. What do you think about developing new habits like that.
15553.0,Patient,I mean i'm up for developing new new habits. I don't know about. That one specifically.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, what talk to me about what you think would work."
15553.0,Patient,"Of i'm trying to develop a new habit of regularly working out because I noticed, I was in a much better place when I did. Okay, but it's hard to do so right now."
760.0,Provider,what's. what's holding you back.
15553.0,Patient,"i'm. Just a lot on my plate and trying to manage it, I feel like I have room on my plate to to do so, but yet it doesn't I always seem to be running out of time. At the end of the day."
760.0,Provider,"So it's the time. Or maybe, is it could it be the energy level with with the by the end of the day, i'm tired now."
15553.0,Patient,"i'm Sir, sometimes it is that. A lot of times it's i've just ran out of time and I need to go to sleep because i've got a wake up at four in the morning."
760.0,Provider,"that's hard, is that these are you used to that."
15553.0,Patient,And mean it's a regular thing for me because of work doesn't mean i'm used to it. enjoy it.
760.0,Provider,"Now, no yeah okay so that's that's challenging do you are you been sleeping well you're getting to bed on time."
15553.0,Patient,"I was for a while and the issue is like the next two weeks i'll be able to get back into that routine and I know I can, the problem is like the last couple of weeks i've had a weird working scheduled to that's allowed me to go home. And whenever i've gone home. My wife wants to hang out with me, especially the day that I get home. Even though it's time for me to really be going to bed. To try to maintain a regular sleeping schedule."
760.0,Provider,mm hmm.
15553.0,Patient,"She sleeps she's working nights. Now, and so she wants to hang out with me a little bit before she has to start work and. I tried to. make her, I want to make her happy and spend all the time with her sort of just going straight to sleep but. Okay, and there's been a few times because of that i've stayed up until midnight one o'clock with her and. For me that's a much. going to battle at 11 midnight, is a much happier place for me in waking up at eight and waking up any. me. seven or eight or more yeah."
760.0,Provider,They not before the sun gets up.
15553.0,Patient,Oh yeah i'm getting up before a lot of people are up.
760.0,Provider,"yeah that's that's challenging. Okay okay so exercise, so what other things, can you do to change your routine to work on changing thoughts. What about. Positive affirmations Have you ever tried that."
15553.0,Patient,"um I just i'm working on doing it in a roundabout way. i've started doing haven't actually posted anything but i've at least been recording it. Of mean. of me when working out because i'm working out to with a goal in mind. Okay, so i'm. i'm recording that with the. Okay, but the I dia to eventually posted up on social media."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so you have working out with a goal of working out talk to me a little bit about that what is what is that what does that mean exactly what is your goal and."
15553.0,Patient,How you knew my my goal is to do an iron man in 2023. With that being the first step is either. and late spring early summer to do a sprint triathlon and by late summer early fall to do an Olympic triathlon next year.
760.0,Provider,wow. Have you ever exercised at that level before in your life.
15553.0,Patient,I have.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, and and how does that how that how did that how long ago was that and how did that feel."
15553.0,Patient,That was about three years ago now.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, and how how was your mental health and your stress level when you were doing that."
15553.0,Patient,In it felt pretty good I felt like I was handling everything that I was managing everything. I was going to school working full time just had a kid. And working out so. I felt like I was managing things well enough. But. It I don't know. I just feel like that's such an for me an important thing I feel like when I start putting a priority on that and making the time. That. i'm able to put things in better places and be able to manage time better and have more energy.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, how was your depression when you're working out like that what happens with your depression is that change at all."
15553.0,Patient,"It does dramatically. When I was working out fairly regularly only on rare occasions, would it be getting depressed."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so does that give you motivation to want to pick yourself up and find. A way to fit this in your schedule or or is it still a challenge, because I know you're just a busy guy."
15553.0,Patient,"i'm knowing that, like my motivation my motivation to do things. With trying to get rid of my depression is like 10%."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so it's not it's not much So what does motivate you then David. What is motivating to to do that."
15553.0,Patient,feeling successful but i've been able to accomplish something that that i've really wanted.
760.0,Provider,mm hmm.
15553.0,Patient,"It. Three years ago, is when I did a half iron man and shortly thereafter i'm I stopped working out. But being able to work up and. And do that I felt very successful that I can I have control of. My life and the things around me and that I can. I can achieve things that I go set out to achieve."
760.0,Provider,So it gives you confidence in yourself does that sound right. Okay. Okay. And why did you stop after you finished a half ironman.
15553.0,Patient,And my wife wanted some me to be a home a little bit more and we got in we're getting ready to move. And then we moved.
760.0,Provider,And I know that takes all the wind back. Moving now yeah that's it that's a chore.
15553.0,Patient,"yeah, especially when. Should we then move to a different country but there's rarely felt like we did."
760.0,Provider,A way to move from.
15553.0,Patient,"While we moved from the Seattle, the Seattle area. To a remote 15 village in Alaska."
760.0,Provider,"Oh, my goodness. That does feel like is that, where you guys live now. say again, where do you live, now I."
15553.0,Patient,don't think you told i'm gonna see if. I have an apartment in Seattle in my in my wife and I own a home in the portland area portland Oregon area.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so so okay so you're living kind of both places now. yeah okay so you're no longer in Alaska. All right. Okay So what do you think it's going to take to get you motivated to get back out there, doing. At least some exercise because. we're where we are right. Now go ahead."
15553.0,Patient,"being more. Persistent about working out during the daylight, at least when i'm in Seattle."
760.0,Provider,mm hmm.
15553.0,Patient,Because when I don't feel safe working out because I I like I a lot of what I do is to run. I don't feel safe running out on the streets.
760.0,Provider,know you probably aren't safe out running on the streets that's that's some good so that's your vacation.
15553.0,Patient,"yeah. Fine, number of homeless people and having gone to bed a few times hearing gunshots yeah."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, well, what if what if you got some equipment for your home like maybe a treadmill so you could run at home."
15553.0,Patient,"Well, at home, I have all that. Though and I feel safe running outside at a dark out."
760.0,Provider,Okay it's.
15553.0,Patient,"The Seattle yeah so granted, I do have a gym membership, but that Jim is also like a 25 minute drive away. So."
760.0,Provider,And there's nothing closer.
15553.0,Patient,Not for the price that i'm paying.
760.0,Provider,Okay.
15553.0,Patient,"Why don't you there is. I do have agenda is closer that is free to me, the issue is there is toxins in the air and that Jim."
760.0,Provider,"Oh, that doesn't sound conducive either. Know what's the point what's the point of getting healthy with exercise to bring in port to breathe and poison and. and make its make yourself sick, so you can't do that no that's not. that's not good."
15553.0,Patient,yeah so.
760.0,Provider,"All right, so what about. A treadmill there where you're at in. In Seattle."
15553.0,Patient,A girl.

760.0,Provider,And that's it.
15553.0,Patient,"that's it. Okay, and there's there's no that that's as comfortable as this place is king as much stuff as I can comfortably have in this place."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so that's that's kind of off the table, then. yeah okay Oh, you can do what you can control and you seem like you're pretty busy when you're there anyway that's where you're working right."
15553.0,Patient,"yeah and it's also where i'm going to do, the majority of my school work when I start up here in a month."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, and how you feeling about school starting."
15553.0,Patient,"i'm not excited about it. At all I i'm, to the point of where I really don't want to do it. And it's something that my wife really wants me to do."
760.0,Provider,And what are you taking with it engineering with it yeah okay.
15553.0,Patient,Like the next class I need to take as calculus to. I already scored low already filled it once and. have to retake it so.
760.0,Provider,"i'm not fun. yeah okay so so it's only your wife that wants you to go to school, you there's no part of you that wants to go to school."
15553.0,Patient,"there's a small part of me, would like to but it just. I don't know what I would do with it, I don't have a desire. To do something with it my desires lane other places. Which mean and may mean that I should probably change degree programs to something that's more in line with my desires of where I want to go I just don't see that degree beyond helping me personally, being able to make me a more higher level person."
760.0,Provider,What is your what are you feeling. What where's your heart want to take you with with. career and education.
15553.0,Patient,"I really want to own my own business, my own small business."
760.0,Provider,What kind of small business.
15553.0,Patient,um that I would really like to to own a firearms retail store.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so sales yelling selling our firearms okay."
15553.0,Patient,So.
760.0,Provider,"Have you. Have you expressed this feeling, or the spot, for your wife."
15553.0,Patient,yeah she kind of pets me on the head of like that's nice Sarah there's go get a regular job. or make or make enough money to where you can start that up. So yeah.
760.0,Provider,"Okay. All right, have you Okay, so what would your What would you go to school for business or."
15553.0,Patient,I know there's business I know there's business entrepreneurship degrees as well.
760.0,Provider,mm hmm.
15553.0,Patient,which would be exactly in line with what i'm wanting to do.
760.0,Provider,"Okay. Okay. All right, so how you going to handle this stress going to school next month on in a degree that you really don't want to pursue."
15553.0,Patient,I haven't thought about it i've been trying not to think about it.
760.0,Provider,well. Think about it because well how do you think that's gonna affect you. It affects your emotions. and your stress and everything.
15553.0,Patient,"yeah I know that all end up feeling panicky about it, I kept putting off the stuff that i've been wanting to just to start helping me to get ready for it, such as starting to study. And refreshing my memory on the stuff that I didn't do so well on. That way, when the class starts i've already got a kind of more of a head start to where I can be more successful."
760.0,Provider,"Okay. All right, so have you been up to me, told your wife your feelings about this this classes, she no."
15553.0,Patient,"No, I haven't because she's very opinionated."
760.0,Provider,"mm hmm. And you you, you find yourself going along with what she wants you to do some of the time or. idea i'm or."
15553.0,Patient,Most of the time.
760.0,Provider,Most of the time How does that make How does that make you feel.
15553.0,Patient,"sad things often to me also feel one sided, even though I may be wrong, how she how I end up feeling. How she respond sometimes puts me down. Instead of just yes, I know it can take an extra 15 minutes or a half hour to. To better explain or to explain in a way that I would understand why my idea may not be the best or whatever, but oftentimes just getting frustrated and not wanting to do that. Not wanting to have those conversations."
760.0,Provider,So she just gets frustrated with you. And kind of shut down the conversation. How do you think that's impacting your mental health and your feelings.
15553.0,Patient,makes me not want to be around.
760.0,Provider,Have you talked to her about this summer.
15553.0,Patient,I have. It when we're going through that really rough patch I did.
760.0,Provider,"But nothing recently. And is that some some of those things where the things you were writing in your journal before that. yeah these kinds of emotions. Okay, so do you feel that you're entitled to the way you feel or do you feel that maybe somehow somehow these feelings may be wrong, or can you can you. Sometimes I feel sad yourself about those feelings in any way."
15553.0,Patient,No really.
760.0,Provider,Okay.
15553.0,Patient,"Because I realized feelings. Generally, have a reason, sometimes I may have blow things out of proportion in meebo really emotional about something. or feel justified in my reasoning. Mostly, because I only have my perspective. And I was never given the chance to have to understand the other side, and which is something I would. I like to know is what what's your somebody else's perspective, so I can have a better understanding of what's going on."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so when you were younger before you met your wife, perhaps, and maybe in your childhood you you weren't, given the time to have a discussion about something or to be taught about something and that feels usual or normal for you is that what I hear."
15553.0,Patient,um well that's how pretty much everything in my family went.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so then that's become normal for you, that that's become the norm."

760.0,Provider,"yeah Okay, I guess, I just feeling a little bit concerned that you're going to be going to school in about a month and i'm just concerned how that's going to affect you once you start that with the stress and and you're doing something for somebody else that you don't want to do."
15553.0,Patient,"yeah I. mean. there's also the added stress in our relationship, right now, of. we're expecting another child so."

15553.0,Patient,"yeah, so I think. Next week she's supposed to have her first like real real appointment. With an Ob gyn. Exactly how far along she is and what the due date is so. But right now, it looks like it's going to be July, something."
760.0,Provider,Okay okay. So that's an additional pressure to. Further your education to further your career and.
15553.0,Patient,You know.
760.0,Provider,that's what you're kind of going through right now.
15553.0,Patient,"yeah and my wife. she's willing to to. Have me continue my current career, even though she doesn't like my current career."
760.0,Provider,Because you're gone for days of the week.
15553.0,Patient,Well that's because that was more by choice not necessarily my job. She wanted to keep her job which happened to be in portland and so. that's why we're in this current situation that that was more by choice than anything.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, do you think it's going to complicate things that she's pregnant to go to couples counseling. Any."
15553.0,Patient,"mean we'll probably have some a few rough patches here and there, with that, but I mean I kind of expected because it's us growing pains."
760.0,Provider,"yeah good word for it. yeah you have to process through that stuff and get better with that. And yeah. and yeah we call it gut work for a reason and then, when two people it's easier when it's just you because it's all about you, but you know when it's too we're talking about more relationship issues. yeah. Okay. well. So. Do you think you would be willing to make a commitment to start looking into these referrals before her pregnancy gets too much further along mark more time does not pass."
15553.0,Patient,yeah.
760.0,Provider,And before you start this this these classes that you're supposed to start.
15553.0,Patient,yeah i'm. Just because it would make life easier does Dino bright heart offers couples counseling.
760.0,Provider,I do not know. I can ask.
15553.0,Patient,I would appreciate that.
760.0,Provider,"yeah I can ask. Okay, so it would be easier, just to do this on zoom i'm. Because you're in different places a lot of the time. Okay okay well that's that's that's a reasonable. thing yeah be harder for you to do Okay, well then, I output in an inquiry and ask about that and see. Have you made any of the calls of the places that you're thinking about and asked about Internet. counseling because there's a lot of places doing that or more so now it's it's kind of."
15553.0,Patient,"So, being in being in the military. I actually go through try cares program and whatnot I just how I ended up with bright heart in the first place to where i'm talking with you, was because of. Everybody I was calling in the Seattle area just kept saying not accepting new patients now accepting new patients not accepting new patients."
760.0,Provider,"Okay. So Okay, let me see if I can play. i'm gonna. see if I can get an answer. Okay, I just texted the question I don't know if i'm going to get an answer in time but. But I guess I can get it in my phone too. yeah let's see if she answers, if not, I will. have somebody reach out to reach out to you with that answer your maybe your care navigators something if I don't get an answer before. Do you think, do you think this this class coming up are these this you know furthering your education next month, you think that's having an effect on your depression."
15553.0,Patient,"At the moment, no."
760.0,Provider,Has it.
15553.0,Patient,"In the past it has. Because it just seems it seems like a mountain of work, because it is. of taking a hard math course in seven weeks."
760.0,Provider,While working full time.
15553.0,Patient,yep working full time taking a what's normally a 16 week course and seven weeks being on the road for seven to eight hours a week going between Seattle and portland. And it's yeah.
760.0,Provider,doesn't. doesn't really sound manageable.
15553.0,Patient,"No. it's it's a lot, and it was hard because of doing that long long drive between Seattle and portland."
760.0,Provider,mm hmm.
15553.0,Patient,"of you know if I was even if if I was not ahead. Doing. Doing that drive. would put me behind especially once I got home. And if I needed for four to six hours to study my wife. was like hey I need you to do these things, and there was. Times where. she's made me feel bad for not doing things is like I needed you to really watch the kid or whatever it's like you, why are you saying these things you know where I am this entire time. In what i'm doing when i'm home."
760.0,Provider,"Okay. All right, I just got an answer. that's why i'm checking my phone I don't usually do that during session. The person I asked is unsure I have to ask another person i'm not sure if that person is still on the clock. Okay, but let me see. i'm. kind of copy and paste the same question to this other individual see what happens. Okay sorry about that."
15553.0,Patient,that's all right.
760.0,Provider,"OK, so the holdup with the couples counseling isn't been that you just haven't done it it's been that you've been hitting roadblocks about."
15553.0,Patient,It yeah I mean I could have put more effort into. doing it as well. Okay. He wants to drink.
760.0,Provider,mm hmm.
15553.0,Patient,Problems it's not an energy drink. it's just sort of components inside the energy treat king.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, I wasn't sure if that was in it, I hope, you're not drinking energy drinks this hour is going to have you up all night."
15553.0,Patient,yeah no. i'm gonna be at work at 6am to make breakfast or two people.
760.0,Provider,Okay. So that means you're up at 4:06am up at 6am okay.
15553.0,Patient,"Oh. yeah. Saturday yeah the weekends, we serve breakfast at seven. During the work days, though we serve breakfast at six a m yes."
760.0,Provider,"All right, so the plan is, couples counseling. And exercise. And do you think you would you you what are some of the things if you were to start couples counseling. Like say tomorrow what would be some of the things that you would want to bring up with your with the therapist and the and your wife there, what would be some of the things you would want to talk talking about."
15553.0,Patient,But just might have a lot to watch on at the moment.
760.0,Provider,Okay.
15553.0,Patient,"or well, let me sorry, let me rephrase that what I have on my plate right now is good, adding school is too much."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so you would want to say that too."
15553.0,Patient,yeah.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, well, I just got an answer. Because I texted that and I just got an answer, which is why i'm checking my phone again. She said no, but we may occasionally do a session with a spouse, in the context of how that helps your recovery."
15553.0,Patient,Okay. well.
760.0,Provider,"Maybe maybe. But it could be you, you could use that help with this issue to tell your wife. What you feel about school. and taking on too much. And you could keep searching."
15553.0,Patient,yeah. Okay.
760.0,Provider,Would you like me to have your care navigator get that situated.
15553.0,Patient,i'm. Not today.
760.0,Provider,"Not today okay well, you want to think on that banner process with that."
15553.0,Patient,"yeah I do just because able to. The conversation that we've been having is being given me confidence that I can hurt my wife, I just have to be."
760.0,Provider,"You need to have something on going. To deal with, I mean i'm sorry your your audio is like. Really glitchy and I thought you put talking. it's. Like didn't quite hear you can start that okay go ahead if you can say that again."
15553.0,Patient,"yeah when when I do approach her I just need to be tactful of how I do it of realizing. Being. Who she is. And how she best response information, so I can get what I The message I want to get across across without her becoming defensive."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, how would you how would you bring up that topic, how could you could you perhaps lead with what you're thinking and feeling like I think or I feel."
15553.0,Patient,"yeah I don't have any problems with that. it's. immediately for her becomes then. Where are you going to do, how are you going to provide for us in the future um. How why I really need you to to go to school, to be successful, and so on. So. it's one of those things of like trying to ease some refer fears of not quitting my job today. Not being kicked out of the. Out of the military, by any means so."
760.0,Provider,"And perhaps you could pursue some of that maybe maybe you could still further your education, maybe that's just not it. Maybe there's something in between your dream of the gun shop. Maybe that's a conversation that you could have about that. Maybe something in business or sales or. might be something that you could think about Adam."
15553.0,Patient,Okay.
760.0,Provider,"If you could talk to her about that because i'm just i'm just getting concerned because I know you're struggling a lot with depression and I just. feel like the more time that passes the closer you get to the start date, the more pressure, and I know that. it's it's going to affect you and in ways that are not going to be good for you. yeah and i'd really rather see you avoid that. Someone. That makes sense. It does it just doesn't sound over I don't. you're not you're not Superman Dave. And you're not you're also not three people that can split up and go do different tasks all at the same time."
15553.0,Patient,I wish I had that superpower.
760.0,Provider,"yeah because that's that's just you know, perhaps, perhaps I could suggest that she's feeling being pregnant. You know, expecting your second child maybe there's some level of fear that she's feeling about financial security for all of you. And so perhaps it's coloring her thinking because. seems like It just seems like it's obviously an awful lot."
15553.0,Patient,yeah.
760.0,Provider,So I would just suggest that maybe even acknowledge or asked her about her feeling asked her about her concern or her worry and that would give her the validation to kind of soften the blow a little bit. of her. explore her own emotion or her own fears that she may i'm guessing. Maybe feeling.
15553.0,Patient,yeah.
760.0,Provider,makes make sense.
15553.0,Patient,It does.
760.0,Provider,"All right. Well, do we have our next session sets."
15553.0,Patient,"We do, and I promised to us at this time."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, well, I i'm looking forward to an update on your on your exercise and what's happening with counseling or at least this conversation you're you're going to have with your wife something. forward are we committing to that. yeah this session. I think so. I don't want to put words in your mouth, but I just I want, I want to know okay so i'm looking forward to that update next time. Okay okay David. Well, I guess, I you can also share, about it in group that would be another place to share, about it."
15553.0,Patient,will see group at times been very uncomfortable with so.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, oh good."
15553.0,Patient,what's hard for me.
760.0,Provider,"that's hard for you, I said."
15553.0,Patient,"yeah I mean I have, I have other issues that group as well, so."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, well, we can talk about that to next time yeah I, I would like to make a suggestion that you're free you're free to say no, I don't want a suggestion or take the suggestion or leaves a suggestion is you can I make a suggestion about. Can you share in group that you feel uncomfortable and grow up without even naming it."
15553.0,Patient,"In group probably not mostly because what makes me feel uncomfortable is, I feel like i'm the only one of my gender in there. I feel a lack of having even a remote connection to somebody of like the a commonality with someone."
760.0,Provider,"Okay. All right, is there, do you think maybe a different group might be more helpful to David."
15553.0,Patient,i'm not sure i'm I know everything just changed with this group.
760.0,Provider,"mm hmm well we're supposed to have a lot more people that were supposed to be in there, I believe there were other men in there."
15553.0,Patient,"I know when I. First, did the group there was another guy in there, one of the one of the persons who was facilitating was a guy. Is but I know all that chain so i'm willing to like write it out for the rest of the year. I see. How things go wrong, maybe I will become more comfortable with it."
760.0,Provider,"Just kind of Okay, well, I invite you to share these concerns sooner not later. Okay, you know part of the healing process means to learning how to speak up and advocate for oneself yeah and say what's going on. Because I really would like to see a go to two groups that that you're being able to process and work through your stuff in."
15553.0,Patient,Okay.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, is that fair. yeah okay wonderful well, it was good really good seeing and talking to you today, David."
