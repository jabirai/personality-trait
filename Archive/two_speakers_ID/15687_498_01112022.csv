15687.0,Patient,For.
498.0,Provider,"How does that sound. Okay you're not on any medication, so one of one of the group is good, but one of the reasons that some people have to go to group is to give me an opportunity to check in with their medication needs.

Staying in the moment and. journaling journaling is the hardest part for me, but you know i'm just i'm trying to keep everything niceties to tells me. Conscious in my mind, so that when i'm in a situation, I can kind of try and apply it, but I mean there's times it's gotten I just idea. But I do catch myself sometimes like. relax you know what you're doing you know. So yeah I mean it is helped me in. But, like, I think the top of the combination of that and then being out of the House, where it was it was just a stressful day. And so it was just like you know every team is always like he can say something, because somebody with a man, and it was just like. It just got to the point where I had to I had to leave, I mean i've been told, for two years it didn't want me there, so I left and then, when I need they want me to come back so, for me it was just like no i'm not coming back to me.
