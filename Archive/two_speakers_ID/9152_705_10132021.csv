9152.0,Patient,"yeah well. i'm on my way to work, so I pulled over and just sitting in the car."
705.0,Provider,"Okay, well, thank you, I appreciate you checking in and just wanting to see how things are going."
9152.0,Patient,Good you know just being a lot like this week it's minimum day so kids get out at 12 so it's a little stressful because I haven't from 12 to six so.
705.0,Provider,"Oh, I was thinking, the opposite, that you would get extra. Time like you know to do other things, but no, you get to see them longer."
9152.0,Patient,"mm hmm yeah normally school goes to between two and three some grades get out to some grades get out of three so I get them three hours four hours, but no today's six hours."
705.0,Provider,"Oh, my goodness, do you have an assistant."
9152.0,Patient,"Oh yeah mm hmm yeah but you know they've been hiring people that are just not doing their job and i've tried different approaches, I try sometime telling him straight out, you know you can't be on your phone, you have to be working. engaging with the. kids i'll sit at the desk you know, and then they get resentful and they are mad and they asked to move to another site so, then I tried being Nice. about it, you know, and then they they like don't think i'm serious i'm too Nice, you know or they'll do just the bare minimum and it's like I just you know I just feel like. I need to figure out how to do this, how to say this because it's my supervisor, but like I don't know how you know, to get them to do what I want them to do."
705.0,Provider,"Right right and have it, where the resentment isn't there that you have that healthy relationship where you can be assertive and, at the risk that it's not a reaction that then you'll get a response."
9152.0,Patient,Right right exactly.
705.0,Provider,whoa wow that's a hard one because you're the Supervisor.
9152.0,Patient,"Right right yeah you know and sometimes like. The people who have been there for the longest time they just feel like man I you know i've been here for so long i'll have to do anything, and then I do everything. i'm the one cleaning and walking the kids to gate and how they can just sit at a desk and watch a movie and just watch me like, how is that I feel so upset like, how can you just work at a job and not do anything."
705.0,Provider,I I sense Jane that it's not built in for you like you can never just sit there.
9152.0,Patient,mm hmm.
705.0,Provider,"yeah I know it's interesting how personalities and just I mean I don't have that in me if I see work meeting to be done it's a new seem the same way, where it's like you do it's your job."
9152.0,Patient,"Right yes. I know it's a different I feel like today's work ethic has just changed, you know young people. I just a lot more laid back yes lazy."
705.0,Provider,"i'm hearing to jam, you know, for you it's self pride, you have pride in your work, and when you took on the job you're like No, this is what i'm doing and i'll carry that out every day, to the best of my ability."
9152.0,Patient,"Right yes yeah yeah you know and sometimes you know people in this field like I mean normally they care because they like kids they want to build relationships and so they know like this is what children need so. It used to not be a problem, so I don't know if they're hiring people and just paying less just because we need the spots filled. And maybe they don't want to be working with kids you know they're not like getting in their teachers degree or you know what I mean."
705.0,Provider,Right right and it's it to me you're still trying to work out what system will work with WHO who they give you. And then I. Change depending on who your next assistant is.
9152.0,Patient,Right yes oops I. Think okay.
705.0,Provider,"No worries my phone just. Pass anything worked in the in the past, like a system of like okay here's our roles now let's split it up who's doing what."
9152.0,Patient,"mm hmm I only have one assistant, right now, because we don't have that lot of kids so, but you still in the past yeah just do like. Like I did more the administrative and I had a head teacher yeah and they would work out together and they would split things up, and I would like oversee it where now, I just have one guy who. he's not showed up to work twice, so we got written up you know and he's the one who sits at the desk watches movies all day so like he's. One foot out the door, so I want to, I want to have a heart to heart and tell him Okay, maybe I should maybe I should say Okay, this is your job every day you're responsible to left on the table, take out the trash. yeah yeah."
705.0,Provider,"You could try that with him, because if it goes from sitting at the desk to where you've given the roles and responsibility, and he chooses not to."
9152.0,Patient,mm hmm.
705.0,Provider,It sounds like natural course of employment will be terminated.
9152.0,Patient,"Can yeah. yeah I know, and I know he's not gonna like me, I told me he's gonna be upset and it's a little like scary you know, and I mean cuz. he's been there for so long, everybody loves jake you know, but my boss knows he's you know not performing right and yeah and licensing is coming in, you know state oh childcare is have to be. yeah so it could be on me if he's not wearing his shirt you're supposed to have your shirt and a tie, all these rules, you know, and if we don't pass that we get fined. yani so maybe I should tell my my boss like you need to give me someone better know like. yeah other sites, we can trade but i'm scared of that too."
705.0,Provider,"yeah you know how you were just telling me about a chain, and I can tell, like, I mean licensing i've worked in treatment facilities and you just say licensing and it's like already the stress is like. yeah do something here have you had that talk with with trey. Like here's what i'm up against."
9152.0,Patient,Know Helen said that I just figured he know you know it's been years i've told them oh yeah licensing is coming. He would know. But I haven't spelled it out for him. I could do that. I don't look forward to it.
705.0,Provider,"that's what i'm sensing. it's how you shared it with me and the approach was great because it's it's just here's the facts status mommy here's what we need to do. You know how can we, how can we work together to get you know you have the same goal is to have."
9152.0,Patient,"uh huh huh yes it's how to say it, without being angry because i'm i'm really angry. You know what I mean i'm trying not to. be angry, but like you said just state the facts, maybe no emotion just say it like I could try that."
705.0,Provider,"But also Jane is. i'm sorry, but that valid reasons to be angry that you're running around and someone sitting at the desk. Non ignore that either I mean you have valid reasons to fill you know. The way you're feeling."
9152.0,Patient,"yeah and the school changed the lock and won't give us the key because he keeps forgetting to lock the gate and it's open if it doesn't lock it it's open to anybody walking on school property so it's like. You know it's not just affecting me it's affecting kids too and, like the school can choose not to have us there you know, like we're kind of walk a fine line with them and if I would lose my child care that would make. me so mad I am so good, I want to tell them like what are you an idiot don't lock the gate."
705.0,Provider,"you're like. it's like a posted right here black. yeah. I know, and then the micromanaging it's like Do you really want to micromanage someone that's been there forever. That knows the rules. By Jane it's. trying to find your comfort zone to I know you're i'm hearing you're trying these different approaches and that's what it's about. yeah yeah."
9152.0,Patient,"Because, then I don't want to make it up. Because then i'm also stress like it's an. uncomfortable work environment, you know. And it's like I don't know how to say something like even with the kids, how do you not stay mad because, if I go back to being just Okay, no big deal, I mean, then they don't take me seriously, you know when I like never done that get yourself so worked up, it takes time to relax but. Right my job you don't have that time to just step away in the lab."
705.0,Provider,And you're already you're already in that headspace before you even get there and then your body to shows that.
9152.0,Patient,Yes. yeah you're right can't hide that.
705.0,Provider,"You can alleviate some of it before you even you know drive into the grounds, you know before you even drive in and maybe some quick meditation. Sorry, my allergies are working overtime. And he had me try, you know it's like that circle of control, we talked about where we have influence on the others, but it's like what can you do, and so, if, before you even arrived it's almost like preparing for your possible battle."
9152.0,Patient,"Yes, oh definitely yeah I can do that I can Park, you know at the dog Park, and you know it's beautiful there's you."
705.0,Provider,"Take it into a couple of deep breaths and and get your body more relaxed because already I can see, as you as you share because you're passionate about what you do and you have someone that's just ignoring what the rules are the rules didn't change."
9152.0,Patient,Like yeah yeah.
705.0,Provider,"I know to you'll find your way, it would be different Jane if you were just going to be passive and let people, just like do what they want to do, but you're still trying what your approaches and then, especially with with Jay of what he will respond to."
9152.0,Patient,"yeah yeah I want to, I want to figure this out because I can't just let him be there, the kids see it I can't it's, it is a big deal. If john a lot. Miss Jane can you go outside with me and i'm like i'm sorry I got a vacuum I gotta clean, you know why can't jake take us out he's just sitting watching movies, like okay so i'll go up to him and i'll say okay take them out all right take them out, you know. And then they come back in and like. We don't want to play with him he's not doing, can we play with you, like so much like yes, I do want to play with you."
705.0,Provider,"Yes, I have all of a sudden, I loved her statement, where you said I gotta figure this out right. right because that's the truth of it is you have to figure it out so it's like Okay, do you feel comfortable sharing that with them is look here's where i'm at."
9152.0,Patient,"hmm that's a good way to put it. Yes, it is. And i'm trying to get you know. You know the excellent see the kids have needs and I can't take care of the Center and the kids needs at the same time. it's saying the negative that I yeah, I guess, I could phrase it. Like if I say like you need to help me out, you know, does that sound right."
705.0,Provider,"You you could, if that's where you feel train you're at and you feel like a direct approach is better. And then. He would respond then okay if, if not the more like assertive but. Like. I want to figure this. Or, I need to figure this."
9152.0,Patient,yeah. Your screen is frozen I didn't catch that too. There we go it's fine no.
705.0,Provider,"Okay, where the other where you say I you know you need to help is a little bit more passive aggressive, it could be, you know, not to say anything, and then I you know i'm I. need your. Help or are you said I I want your help. However, it is, but what i'm thinking is what you said was what I was keying in on is it's joining with him of let's figure this out, we need to figure this out. oh eight is coming, so we need to figure this out and so here's some areas that I see. That we can improve on."
9152.0,Patient,uh huh okay okay that sounds good. Oh yeah.
705.0,Provider,"yeah How else do you get you know the buying in like you could invite him to hey give me some feedback like we would do in group what's coming up for you, because it's all different right."
9152.0,Patient,"Right mm hmm yes yeah I can do that. let's put it. That we get the sense, where team."
705.0,Provider,yeah if that feels comfortable for you Jane.
9152.0,Patient,yeah no I like that yeah.
705.0,Provider,"All right, I just want to make sure, because this is just a sounding board, you can share what you want to share it and role model, you know where you can say different things, and how it sounds. But at the end of the day, it's going to be you walking in there and feeling comfortable with what you're sharing."
9152.0,Patient,"yeah yeah totally no that sounds good, because he does say you know he likes the teenagers he does say I want to do this with them, I want to do that with them, and he doesn't but I know it's in there in his head that he. sees like a Center and he's part of it."
705.0,Provider,"yeah yeah and it just says. Sometimes, with colleagues is how to motivate one another and if they're so burnt out it's beyond that, or is it just lack of motivation and we can support one another."
9152.0,Patient,"Right that's what I think it is lack of motivation. yeah yeah so that's the thing I have to learn how to I was thinking, maybe to take a course you know I don't know how to supervise i'm just learning, you know, but maybe I could take a course of something this winter. motivate people or you know."
705.0,Provider,"And how I just like you said you don't have this experience, yet, and so to get some some guidelines some tips, of how to go about it because, just as you're explaining you've worked with different people that not all not all approaches are going to be a good cause."
9152.0,Patient,mm hmm yes yeah I guess a supervisor must have to know you know how to reach them all the different kinds of personalities.
705.0,Provider,"Absolutely, and I already hear you saying with Jay that there's some really good qualities. That it's not like you're you're talking about somebody else that just doesn't care to be there, he cares. yeah presenting him with that of you know here's the things that I see that I really like can also be a way to engage in the conversation, sometimes in counseling they call it. two paths and once like."
9152.0,Patient,"Oh, really."
705.0,Provider,So it's two to two like praises of what you see. When you go into any type of correction needed.
9152.0,Patient,"uh huh uh huh okay so two things before okay. yeah. Excuse me, sorry."
705.0,Provider,"Oh no worries it's a I know how it is with coffee um but there's different tactics like that chain that again you're figuring out what your supervising style is like. And again. You know it's. As you go along, putting different things in your tool belt."
9152.0,Patient,"yeah yeah I feel it's me sometimes to like I feel bad or guilty and you know I feel like well, maybe i'm making it too easy me or my not friendly enough I don't know you know, like. I have to I don't I have to not. take it personally, I guess, I don't. it's hard not to take it personal."
705.0,Provider,"Right and it's it's easy to have like see the fault within yourself but, to be fair and you did recognize it for a moment this is new to you, and so it is like anything else you're already thinking about taking a class to help educate you a little bit more give you some more tools."
9152.0,Patient,yeah.
705.0,Provider,"yeah. A lot of times, people will respond Jane you know well, first of all the rules are there in the guidelines you might get a lot of people that you would never have to have this conversation because they just do what's. being required right."
9152.0,Patient,Right hey yeah.
705.0,Provider,"are ready, is realizing you're in a predicament that. Hopefully won't be all the time."
9152.0,Patient,"mm hmm. yeah yeah I mean, I can see him and summer camp he runs his own. splash camp and he's great you know I know it's. You know I know it's there, so I wasn't really depending on me having to like spell it out and talk to him directly I kind of thought he just transition over so I don't know if he just doesn't like after school to you know, like so. Maybe it's not his place, maybe it just doesn't fit him, you know. I mean somewhere else in the line, maybe. No, but I can talk to him first."
705.0,Provider,"How your approach right now Jane again to me, is very inviting. Where you're talking about you know hey I saw you in this environment. Checking in to see what's going on now, because it seems like. something's going on, I can't you know I don't know help me understand basically."
9152.0,Patient,"yeah yeah. Yes, definitely. do that."
705.0,Provider,"And then, keeping yourself, because this has to be create some extra stress for you is keeping yourself to like practicing some self care."
9152.0,Patient,yeah let it do the breathing thing right now.
705.0,Provider,"And in your daily routine to at night, are you able to do anything to kind of disconnect from the work day."
9152.0,Patient,"I it's been hard this week, I mean I just basically go home he watch a little TV and fall asleep and then get up the next day, and like I have like every other day, I have to be there at 730 so. Sometimes you know I go home eat go to sleep. Excuse me, because you know I live an hour away from my job."
705.0,Provider,Oh wow.
9152.0,Patient,"yeah get out six drive an hour some home at seven you know get ready for the next day, a little bit you know he that I just go to bed 910 o'clock to get up at five."
705.0,Provider,"mm hmm. So yeah with that commute to I think in the book, where it was sharing like different ways to look at the commute remember then tidy book, where he was talking about one person might view it as oh my gosh I have an hour, where the other person might view it as this is an opportunity. yeah maybe you know, listen to a podcast or do something. else that you feel would help you disconnect from work."
9152.0,Patient,"yeah I do i'm the warrior to I am I do listen I got my coffee in the morning and happy and then I thought will pop in my head, you know that's thing you know I kind of just like not like. I try to think about not thinking about it, then i'm. thinking and then go back to listening, you know. i'm like okay I gotta do this I gotta do that oh my God yeah the kids going to behave is my coworker gonna help me, am I gonna be running around crazy."
705.0,Provider,What could bring you back what can you tell yourself to bring you back.
9152.0,Patient,"um. I guess I could do the meditating before going to work, you know, and then I like a go for a walk or I listen to music or going."
705.0,Provider,Quiet again and when you're in the car and all the worries start storming. Straight at you. yeah is there any thing that you can start to almost like verbally block or visually.
9152.0,Patient,"uh huh yeah I remember you were saying, or maybe it was about. Chatel was like if you put something cold on your hand like right here it kind of puts your mind back and. I don't have anything with me, but I guess I could use bring an ice pack or something in the morning."
705.0,Provider,"yeah you can do an ice Pack and put it there sometimes to thought thought stopping techniques as you see a stop sign. So when you when you recognize you're going into worry is, you see a stop sign and you're like okay stop or sometimes people will even wear like a rubber band and kind of snap out of it. technique if you're more visual verbal you could just stay safe stop. These are different things to explore Jane if you feel like it's getting to a point where it's okay to have some of the thoughts and be like Okay, you know. Sometimes a little bit of what else can be like Okay, but when it grows and grows and grows and then you're filling your body tense up and the heart rate increase."
9152.0,Patient,yeah okay.
705.0,Provider,I think you are in the group to where they talked about the worry bucket or that the worry jar.
9152.0,Patient,"Or the. Market yes yeah that did work, I tried that one time."
705.0,Provider,"yeah, so why you're driving you know you could just think that somewhere in your car is this this effort bucket or the worry."
9152.0,Patient,jar and.
705.0,Provider,As you're driving home and it comes into your podcast it's like. No going back in the JAR.
9152.0,Patient,yeah totally yeah like.
705.0,Provider,"mom. yeah absolutely absolutely, especially at home with you're creating your safe space. mm hmm yeah I wanted to check to Jane with you know how we're talking about the care intensities and I know with your your work schedule right now.

9152.0,Patient,mm hmm yes.
705.0,Provider,"Is that still working like, with your group your groups would it work better to have like a minimum of twice a month or do you feel like weekly is what you need."
9152.0,Patient,A know twice a month with a better for me.
705.0,Provider,yeah. I will then do that to twice a month and then. Here yeah.
9152.0,Patient,Key.
705.0,Provider,"Just if you can keep track of when you do come where you know that you've done your twice twice a month i'm seeing that let's see that i'm looking in October. It looks like that you already did on the first. And then, it looks like he came in on the eighth right chain.

9152.0,Patient,"Oh, I suck but, like, I thought I was scheduled to do, I like what is upright heart wanted twice a month, but I didn't know if it meant twice with you or once with you, and once with Valerie. So."
705.0,Provider,"What I looked at, is when you had talked about going to work and that you could only meet one time, a month, so that intensity to one time, a month. Okay, but you need more we can meet more."
9152.0,Patient,"yeah no it's easier once a month, just because I work."
