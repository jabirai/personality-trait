431.0,Provider,"dash two so one and a half. Okay, as as written basically. Yes, Okay, and then one film and I, and when you take a, how do you take it just curious."
9736.0,Patient,Little dissolve I put it down to one and a half and my son will dissolve the same thing and even apply to one my friend late dissolve as SP everything guys to dissolve because i'm. Falling I was getting real bad headaches.
431.0,Provider,"Yes, here's a clap for you for doing it right you'd be surprised how many people don't do that and I didn't even know that I was wanting to another place for almost a year ago I started, one of my heart health."
9736.0,Patient,"And they never told me they're all like, and I was complaining about my headaches, but when I started, seeing them washer she saw me to try that and i'd be in."
431.0,Provider,"Right so. For for my purposes, how long do you leave the film in five minutes."
9736.0,Patient,"Five minutes but being that being. spit it out, I like i've become since i'm I feel like i'm kind of speaking a medicine so since i'm I might even longer, but happiness, do you sit with them."
431.0,Provider,"So no great because I usually tell people five to 10 minutes i'm literally using you as kind of a bouncing board because some patients don't like that taste. Right, so they can't handle the heaven and but between five and 10 minutes you'll get most of medications already absorbed so if even if you spit out the residual whatever is left after medication is already absorb so don't worry about it."
9736.0,Patient,"Right yeah that's the same thing about a marcia tell me. yeah I think this kind of. A mind thing like I see them, you know the orange."
431.0,Provider,"If you can, if the taste, is not a horrible to you yeah you can keep it in there and then just spit spit and then rinse your mouth and spit out."
9736.0,Patient,It helps a lot so i'm glad to hear that i've.
431.0,Provider,"i've recently started to ask patients about how they take it, because every time I ask is like I don't know I just pop it in, and you know, and I saw the rest. Like yeah yeah okay so she your last prescription was given in let's see on the. day the 10th 910. I gotta do some math real quick. And then, is that when you pick only with a refill and we feel so. Two and a half, you take two and a half a day right."
9736.0,Patient,By 10 is a four day supply.
431.0,Provider,"All right, so it was an eight day supply basically was given that should have lasted you so do you when was the last time you took your dose."
9736.0,Patient,I said the last one last Monday was yesterday evening.
431.0,Provider,Okay. Last those yesterday evening.
9736.0,Patient,uh huh.
431.0,Provider,We on the 10th you picked up an eight day supply.
9736.0,Patient,"So the pharmacy Oh, I never I never get an eight day supply the zombies always a."
431.0,Provider,"Plus for. Well, for years for total is eight so just doing both with the refill."
9736.0,Patient,On the 10th what is today.
431.0,Provider,Today is the 17th.
9736.0,Patient,"um. yeah i'm not i'm not quite on it at least sure, but I took my list and one last night."
431.0,Provider,"huh Okay, because."
9736.0,Patient,"I have been have been. i'm not even sure i've been so confused, I have been having so many problems with because I had been using real up for evidence the forms out being who's there forever and they they saw me. About three prescriptions ago there was a change and I had to find another pharmacy because. The more supporting local pharmacy even though she was in North Carolina had to find another pharmacy so I switched to walgreens and then I was, I went in like three days without any medicine, because walgreens here my prescription, but they didn't have. The scripts which I had called because I must tell me to make sure that they had them before she sent me. An idea, and then, once they get the scoop they don't have it, so they are. Telling the being to being a being this always three days, so do I switch to another walgreens and the same thing happening I waited three days I have not made sense, but then I had to switch to CVs so I know being so many days in between medicine every day I don't he ran out."
431.0,Provider,I know all.
9736.0,Patient,of us.
431.0,Provider,"So the reason why i'm. highlighting that date is because so there's a day that the doctor write a prescription for you right. And you may go the same day and pick it up, or you may not. So you might you, you will purchase it on another day. The thing with the pharmacy as well as your health plan. They do math on their own. So their math don't start counting until you pay for your medication so they're like okay. Ashley got her medication on the 10th right, so if she got a four day supply the pharmacy systems math and your insurances math is saying 10 plus four is the 14. So typically that's where you go because there was a one refill so i'm guessing you picked up a refill on the 14th. On the 14th they let you pick up another one, the insurance covers. And then they say okay actually got another four days supply. So that's your last word to the 18th and you're not basically the pharmacy won't fill again for you until the 18th want more so your insurance it's not going to pay for it again until the 18th because of that math. And I get I get what you're saying, sometimes there's all this delay and you may not even get your medicine, you know you will go three days without it, but then to the pharmacy they're just like well she got it on that day she started out they that's when they start counting. So I can definitely get a bridge prescription and for you just want to give you a heads up that you cannot be able to pick up anything, or maybe well until the 16th I mean the 16th Saturday the 18th or. Your pharmacy lets you pick up like a day early sometimes to give people a little wiggle room."
9736.0,Patient,"um and it right, you know what you."
431.0,Provider,Know does that make sense to you that for me.
9736.0,Patient,"It does make sense and like I said i'll just be on top i'm just moved with have you been completely gone through, but you like I knew that I was opposed to getting a test tomorrow, but I know that bright heart health. Before when I had a pub on Saturday, so this will call the day because I know that I just told me the artists, the problem was closed on Saturday."
431.0,Provider,"yeah, we are not here, so we can call your farmer some some money."
9736.0,Patient,Right so guess what the old my point of call it a day. Are we.
431.0,Provider,"Trying to be proactive, so you do you have any medication, less than two."
9736.0,Patient,"I don't have. I don't have to my lead that's why i'm trying to understand, but that's what my last group. yeah. that's weird. I mean, I should have here hold on sorry 14 to. The spot. Right so so let me, I should have a two and a half foot today to."
431.0,Provider,"You should have had enough at least last night, I think, based on. Right so i'm up in the. morning, you can get more, but I think the way the pharmacy math doesn't count the day like what the day you pick it up, they don't wait they don't count that."
9736.0,Patient,"They either have to because the day that I picked it up was the day that I needed because I. guess what. I saw on the 14th I needed it on the 14th to take on the fourth thing so 140 to 80 is supposed to be tomorrow, but I don't know what."
431.0,Provider,"yeah so again, I think they sometimes will let people pick up a day you know, based on their math you can you can potentially get it today, but i'm just saying, sometimes it. isn't The thing that I will count like you know from 1010 up on the 10th if you've counted as one day, then 10th 11th 12th 13th is when you should be able to pick up right. or some systems will count. The 10 plus for us the 14th when you're saying i'm not going to like get to the pharmacy system and tell them."
9736.0,Patient,"All right, I see that's why I think the. problem is because I own a tip when I picked it up, it was four to 10 so 10 1112."
431.0,Provider,"Right so you're taking it that day already right okay. So what let me see so your appointments are usually on third Tuesdays. Is that correct. Yes, okay um. And the fall along sorry there's so many times open. I want to just double check your appointment time, so your next appointment scheduled for the 21st okay."
9736.0,Patient,This Tuesday 7pm.
431.0,Provider,yeah is that the one you're trying to figure out if.
9736.0,Patient,you're right.
431.0,Provider,"Okay, so what i'm going to do."
9736.0,Patient,But it only they said in the olden times was Tuesday or Wednesday so i'm gonna have to go to one of the the Tuesday PM on Wednesday yeah.
431.0,Provider,"yeah yes get figure that out, so let me just do some quick math. alright. So what i'm seeing here our system is asking me to give you a system is prompting me for a shorter prescription each time with a refill, and the reason is because of all these cancelled appointments. hold on and then also the uds. I think the uds mainly the main driver plus an individual therapy appointment, that you have not scheduled is that right, I don't see it on here, it can you. That was on. September 1 so for the uds and the therapy appointment is the reason why it's telling me to give you a shorter duration, each time what I will give you as a three day supply plus when we feel for a total of six days. This will get you to better to lead through social media. yeah so you have time to figure out to Sarah Wednesday which group you're going to go to. So i'll double l so. yeah so what I. mean do this real quick. And the pharmacy I see here is a CVs pharmacy on Martin Luther King jr in new Bern."
9736.0,Patient,Is that correct for you is this going.
431.0,Provider,"All right, and then two questions, maybe three. Any withdrawal symptoms or cravings with your those. So it's a dose is working for you. Is any. Use of illicit medications and methamphetamines other opioids. No okay good job great job if people tell you that enough."
9736.0,Patient,"yeah i've been doing, do you know hanging in there every year, so."
431.0,Provider,"All right, and then because i'm a pharmacist i'm gonna ask you about are you currently smoking. I do smoke okay. that's okay um. How much do you smoke a day."
9736.0,Patient,It sadly too much ammo look about a PIC today.
431.0,Provider,How much.
9736.0,Patient,About a pair.
431.0,Provider,"of half a day okay. All right, no, I heard worse, but it can probably save you some money cigarettes are expensive. um any any plan on putting or cutting back."
9736.0,Patient,"um I mean you know, I would like to because I know that I smoke too much, but he's like his last, so much so. Like I like right now, this come by my escape."
431.0,Provider,"You know. No. brainer honesty. um one thing at a time, it is one of the best things you can do for your health though honestly if it's just a nicotine I don't even care, that much is the smoke you actually smoke cigarettes or the faith."
9736.0,Patient,yeah smoke cigarettes.
431.0,Provider,"yeah so the sick, the smoke is the part that's really."
9736.0,Patient,"Bad and, believe me, I know, because when I clean my car windows, I did that with so. boring, I was like oh my God it was terrible but. So I know that's a."
431.0,Provider,"that's a great visual right inside of your car, so you know when you're ready to quit you know I let Dr Marshall know. I think people have better successes when their care team is involved and we're. i'm here to support you there's a lot of nicotine replacement products too, so it gives you the nicotine, which keeps you going back to the smoke, but then without the smoke so that's always an option to think about, but I will leave it up to you i'm not going to badger you anymore. To do right now is I will call your CVs. to place the the bridge prescription for you again it's gonna be a three day plus one refill. Okay, content and then that can be definitely be lengthened if you do your uds and then or making them and and make an appointment for your therapy because it's just so important for your recovery right the medication is one piece of it. But the other is really just to be able to kind of. discuss and talk about tools. To use, and I really believe in that. You know so. I do you want to stay on the phone do you have time to stay, while I call the pharmacy and then confirm with you."
9736.0,Patient,Is this one.
431.0,Provider,"Okay, so i'm going to disconnect from audio you won't hear me you'll just see me and i'll let you know. When when I finished, a call okay."
9736.0,Patient,"Okay, all right, thank you."
431.0,Provider,Ashley.
9736.0,Patient,Okay.
431.0,Provider,"I called on your prescription to CVs pharmacy is Michael and they will get that phil today, they said, to give them about 45 minutes. Okay, and they should be able to pick up today."
9736.0,Patient,"Okay, all right Thank you so much."
431.0,Provider,Please go to your appointment next what.
9736.0,Patient,"While Tuesday, Wednesday or that out. Thank you, I read."
431.0,Provider,"Patient Ashley war data birds June 16 1986 was assistant in the. rx services we see from one. PM pst for for expression bridge due to miss appointment on 914 patient was evaluated for symptoms of withdrawal and craving.
