And they're like hey there's an alligator on the the Chiefs car and we like what so we go up there, and we call like like a like a. Fish and wildlife, you know professional he comes down to the base and he's got like the the whole rig and he gets out, we got it cornered like on the tennis courts now he's pretty decent size. And a guy comes out and he looks at it. And he gets back in his car to get all this other stuff and he was like oh shit like went back and we're like oh it's just going to be a problem because, like it's a. Music that's a decent sized gator for like where we are so we're like we're all like ready with our gods like ready to. ask for like. That, but the chief was like he said, like he was walking out to his car and then you just heard a hissing. Like underneath his car and he thought he had a flat tire and he said he looked down, and it was like right there and it was like holy shit like you just kind of process it fast enough, and like just took off."
1629.0,Patient,Thank God it is that I mean just didn't buy when he got close.
724.0,Provider,"yeah during the day they're pretty sluggish you know because they're like recharge their batteries because they're cold blooded so they're like they're real slow but at night, like they're ready to go the fire it up."

Okay, well, I told my wife she's pissed I told her when we get back i'm going to quit only reason i'm not quitting before he goes, because my sister smokes that she's gone. And I told my wife, I already know what's going to happen she's gonna be smoking and then i'm going to want one and it's just going to be sucking. Nuts not fun for me so soon as I get back not around her there's smokers are gone back to Vegas so that's plan. So I got that and then get back in the gym is. Seven done yet so."

1629.0,Patient,"yeah yes. Yes, she was."
724.0,Provider,more manageable.
1629.0,Patient,"yeah it's like one or boyfriend which is basically my my wife's dad he actually is the one that walked her down the aisle. When we got married he's a good dude when he comes it's all fine he keeps her in line. When she comes by herself that she starts acting like an idiot. doing good these days, unless she she. She was all fucked up on pills, for a long time and they finally got her all managed on those and. got rid of the she was like I think on xanax or something just blah blah, you know just walking around like a zombie and used to irritate the shit out of his spelling not realizing it and she's not on those anymore so she checks normal now. Okay, so among my my son my stepson flew down from Texas, or he was here, so the House was full so yeah it was good, we had a good time. I took the whole week off last week my whole crew did so I was, I was here to kind of watch over so that was good. But we just relaxed and we had a good time. It wasn't bad it sounds like."
724.0,Provider,"i'm. So, so no issues here as far as the medication goes, everything is cool no major change."
1629.0,Patient,"No last last this this script I just got. I get the text like I told you from Dr regale every time she puts it in she I got the text like one evening. And two hours later walgreens sends me a text message saying it's ready for pickup and normally I got a call them and ask them one point, can I get it gotta gotta gotta so there's just. So fucked up over a walgreens man, so this time, which is the first time in three years they they just send me a text said it was ready and have to do nothing but go pick it up so yeah everything's good with that yeah that was nice."
724.0,Provider,I wish it.
1629.0,Patient,"could be like that so there's. Something. A pharmacist or i'm wondering if there's a different system they put in place, I don't know it actually was. was still December, though, so I think it was like the 29th or 30th so."
724.0,Provider,yeah.
1629.0,Patient,i've been getting.
724.0,Provider,"i've been getting some feedback from people like back home here that we all like a lot of my co workers and friends and stuff like that we all work in this business. So i've been asking them stuff based on what you've California people have been telling me about like your experiences with pharmacies to see they're getting the same results here and they are and they're like I heard that some of the pharmacist, or just being like. They don't know if they're not ordering enough or they're just being vindictive. And they're ordering process, you know for like a lot of these patients and then like micromanaging the scripts themselves being like yeah I only got you know no you're supposed to be here for whatever it is 26 but I got 10 today, you have to come back and."
1629.0,Patient,"I haven't had. It had. been lucky, then they never told me they didn't have it."
724.0,Provider,ever have enough or.
1629.0,Patient,Never had that problem yet so i'm sure it's coming.
724.0,Provider,"yeah yeah and I live in like like obviously like I live in a small state right the smallest technically, but the like the city where most of my co workers are in it's. relatively small, but very hoity toity like Taylor swift owns a house out there, like she he actually owns like the most expensive house in the state right and she paid and like a duffel bag, full of cash. And because of the holiday. It like the program that I worked at didn't want that program that we put into the town so like the whole community is."
1629.0,Patient,kind of like.
724.0,Provider,"addictive a little bit you know what I mean like they don't really they don't really care for despite like like that local ever really having a problem with opiates you know what I mean. So sometimes like that there's a little bit of that going on and. there's nothing to complain to because the pharmacist is like in charge, a lot of times of the store itself they're like the manager is the pharmacist so it's like like this weird thing So hopefully it never gets to that point with you guys."
1629.0,Patient,"So far, so good, with that part."
724.0,Provider,Any any upcoming medical appointments medical concerns.
1629.0,Patient,"nope no i'm actually the only medical appointment I got coming up and I don't have a date yet is I told my wife today that I want to get scheduled for my booster before we. Leave to Florida, and then we made, I decided I didn't I was hesitant, but I decided to get my nine year old daughter vaccinators so she goes on the 12th for her first goes. I just I don't know man I just i've got I was like. Honestly, I was like one of the first people. That I knew how to everybody, I know that I worked with friends family everybody, I was one of the first to get that back same. And the reason is because I work at the hospital and one day one of the girls that works for the general contractor she she said, they said we could go upstairs and get him. That they that they're offering them to all the employees first so me and my superintendent we decided to go up and get it and. You know 21 days later, whatever we got the second dose and i'm i've never had cove it i've been around a lot of people that couple days later, they call me in a you know, a, by the way, we've tested positive friends and family and i've never caught it my wife's never caught it so."
724.0,Provider,Obviously vaccinated to.
1629.0,Patient,what's that.
724.0,Provider,Is your wife vaccinated too.
1629.0,Patient,"yeah yeah she's a nurse she's aren't. focused, you know she was vaccinated right when I was would never gotten it so it's obviously working and now i'm thinking. You know we're getting on a plane going to Disney world and I don't want my daughter to get that shit you know I don't know how kids are going to react to a certain kids you know and. I talked to my wife Lisa and she told me that a couple of the moms of eva's friends about it, they were fine. So we're going to go ahead and get her the first go should get the first dose on the 12 she won't be able to get the second dose and tell her back, but at least one does it better than none so. we're going to do that and then no. matter my wife just got home before I came up here to do this on this call, so when I get back downstairs i'll see what she found out for us so for some reason the hospital that I work at they're not offering the booster like like they did the first set a shot, so I don't know why."
724.0,Provider,"So this will be now how many boosters so there's initially it starts as a two shot cycle other other sense that are there to boosters sense, then."
1629.0,Patient,Know for my understanding it's just one booster so far.
724.0,Provider,"Okay, so it's just the three shots. yeah because there was talks of like a fourth."
1629.0,Patient,"Right yeah that now that's another yeah I don't know if they're going to keep doing it. But I just I mean it obviously work like I said I haven't got it i've been around people i've worked at a hospital and we're right now we're doing the ED remodel. And every morning. When I get to work at six there's a hallway I gotta walk down, which is right in the middle of the Holy er and. Or the emergency department and it's just every morning there's least four people and they're usually good tell her the bonds from oakland. And they they leave them out on the stretch the on the beds right in the hallway they keep them on one side and there's always at least four of them and they sit there all day and I have to walk past him. You know and i'm sure, a lot of them are there because of you know coated symptoms and i've never done so obviously the way I feel is the vaccine works."
724.0,Provider,"yeah yeah there's something to it, I worked. On a few, if I were totally but before I started this gig I worked in the er. At my local one of my local hospitals here in the psych unit becomes like the security unit right. And I started in November 2019. And kovats you know, obviously coven happened and then like Pico would have, and although right now, you can probably considered like right now being potentially like pete coven. and none of us wore masks there was no vaccine and we didn't even get mandated until like the end of August to start wearing masks you know what I mean like. It was like way past, and you know, for the most part, all the people that I worked with like nobody got it and, like I like I had covert exposures and I got like fist fights with people that had coven for sure there you know what I mean like and. In a locked unit and like none of us ever got it was very strange, but a lot of us had been sick in November and December of that year, like a lot of us were down for like a few days, what we thought was the flu, or like real bad colds. So the general consensus is that we're all like yeah we all got it we will think that we had coven before they really started reporting it. Because it systematically like hit us and then like know every time they were like oh it's really bad it's really bad and then we were like how come like none of us are. Like God and it looked like it was weird and like like literally like. Like if you in the er at night, especially when you're homeless populations mental health breaks COPs bringing in people that were drunk for di wires like. We had like lots and lots of tussles and stuff and then you know we'd find out hours later, that they were positive for coven they'd have to take him out of the unit, and I mean and we're like shit and we'd so just like we're just constantly like waiting like washing our hands like. sprightly we like those hospital Weiss would be like wiping are. closed down and like just non stop and nobody ever got popped, for you know, to this day, like a lot of the security guys and stuff that i've worked with never positive for. Nice."
1629.0,Patient,"Those yeah I mean I didn't have the shot for. I mean i'd imagine it's probably been almost a year since I got that first the first vaccine, but I mean. It was about what four to five months after that first big outbreak and I was right there in the hospital, you know and that's that first that's why I was we were tripping because we're like we keep hearing about all these hospitals being. packed and no beds and we look around our hospital, which is a huge hospital and. And there was tons of beds and they had a coven unit was never no one in there. The most people i've ever seen in there was like two. Right, so it was just weird man at first, I thought I mean I was listening to all the conspiracy should. Who knows what to believe, but yeah at first, I was like I didn't know vaccine, but then we started hearing that Oh, you know what they're going to start making anybody in the hospital. So much they offered it I just. My boss said he was gonna do it i'm like screw it let's just get it over with so."
724.0,Provider,"And it's funny that you say that because. Like you, I was there for. pete coven and the hospital was a ghost town er. yeah and we could House like 120 people in the er was a ghost town and i'm sure you've probably seen like the like the nurses, that the nursing station, they have like. That on their computer screen, they have, like all the people that are in their unit, you know pods and all that kind of stuff my unit, the same way. I had the entire access to see everybody that was in and what they're in for how long they've been here for and the entire emergency room. And there were so many nights where the nurses had nothing to do because there'd be like 12 people total any er and neither of them were in my unit, because they were drunk. When they had a mental health break and the other three were in here for stomach ache or a Stub toe. When we see like a code, because they had like a covert symbol that would be next to their name would be like oh shit so that person's got coven and we'd like go by their room and they'd be sitting like up on their bed like watching TV and we're like what is going on. yeah that's how it was it was a for six months, it was a ghost town in the year and. I was like this is. like this is bullshit it's a joke, we got tons of free food you're going to be, but like literally like these people, we set up to tense and."
1629.0,Patient,outside of our attempt for like fast testing.
724.0,Provider,"We ended up taking it down twice and then putting it back up because the State wanted it, and then we consolidated the two tents to 110. never went in we had a National Guard off site coven response little base set up in the city, because a bunch of my nurses went there and they got paid big money to go, they were like, here we go there. and sleep because nobody's there New York City had you know they had record numbers, we know that they did allegedly right, but you remember when they sent up like the navy health ship, it was important never used. The same thing never used so it was like a lot of us were like from what we were reading we're like any day now it's gonna get crazy, this is the week it's going to get crazy and i'll get never did or like. This is a little by little people started coming back to the hospital with their don't bullshit and you're like Okay, here we go and then we. started seeing cove it. is strange."
1629.0,Patient,"yeah that's a trippy say that because. they'd send up the tents, they set up the tense to at our at our hospital and then never even used him."
724.0,Provider,yep.
1629.0,Patient,We never like really walked by one day and. These big old. tent set up. The neck they took them down a couple weeks later yep.
724.0,Provider,"We had a kick out homeless people out of our tents, because they were sleeping. After we would kick him out of like my unit after discharge, it was, like all right, you know you dry it out your cleaned up hard get your free meal. and your you know your warm bed for the night, you know go kick rocks will see you in a couple days and like literally security they made it mandatory that security would have to check the tense, because they would go in. And they'd be like people like. Like freeze like nobody could see them if they stood still and it was like get out, you know if we knew all their name, you know what I mean, so it was it was like a weird thing so like what we saw what I saw personally, and what I was reading was totally opposite."
1629.0,Patient,yeah that's it as a true.
724.0,Provider,And it was was certainly very confusing so.
1629.0,Patient,yeah that's why.
724.0,Provider,"When I hear stuff you know I take everything with a grain of salt it's like yeah I mean trust, but verify look i'd have to go until like the er to see. yeah it's anything like I remember it being it was, like all those heroes right we're playing candy crush on their phone all night. And exactly and grab ass in the hall so. I was like I will say."
1629.0,Patient,hard to know what to believe.
724.0,Provider,"For sure yep so you're going on vacation so you got bigger and better things to worry about. So they they changed the the survey protocol here I don't know if, like when you checked in if they explain it yet or do that at all and i'll just leave it to us, but for for individuals that go to group, like once a month you're only required to do the survey. once a month now that's what i'm being told so. The survey, like all three of them right. yeah the pH Q and the gad seven at the band seven. Now you're probably still responsible for for maybe doing to have to have the pH canines to the gad sevens and maybe for the band sevens or maybe just one of the band sevens because you show up for one week so i'm not entirely sure if they hammered that detail out yet."
1629.0,Patient,"Okay well i'll keep just trying to do them like we've talked about every Sunday, for the most part, done them for the most part i'll keep doing it until they tell me different It only takes honestly."
724.0,Provider,Two minutes.
1629.0,Patient,and manage yeah. yeah i've known him and then. When when they figure out exactly what they want them yeah. No worries.
724.0,Provider,"Okay um and the last two that you did you score and zeros on is what it looks like so you're no no anxiety know depression, no, no concerns they have."
1629.0,Patient,"Their own mouth that pretty much the same answer to every every everyone, so I don't have none of those issues like. Depression and anxiety, you know sleep problems, no eating problems good old. tamper or nothing everything's normal."
724.0,Provider,"Good. So we want to see or the last talk screen you did was. You know negative for everything that's not supposed to be there, so and a positive for the thing that is your good there too, so yeah it doing good Todd I don't know. Not to say that I don't worry about everybody, but you're pretty stable, you know what I mean still working good family support like you know what I mean like you're you're doing the thing that's this is how it's supposed to be so.
