740.0,Provider,How are you.
8380.0,Patient,i'm doing pretty good isn't there a bit of a lag.
740.0,Provider,your wife missing up.
8380.0,Patient,"All right, hold on one, second, let me see. there's people in the House, so I was outside but i'm gonna try going to another location. Okay, that should, is it seemed like it's better."
740.0,Provider,"Yes, ma'am."
8380.0,Patient,Alright cool.
740.0,Provider,So how have you been I think the last one off it was in October.
8380.0,Patient,how's it been that long.
740.0,Provider,"So, how would it be."
8380.0,Patient,"It has been a little crazy things. got a little out of hand, I think I told you about when I split my forehead open when I was working for that lady, and she had been. got me back into drinking again. So anyhow long story short, my best friend she also has has an alcohol problem and then she had quit for a month and then one on one of those high and mighty and. was getting on my ass which you know I can understand. Then she decided to break her sobriety and then I broke my sobriety, I guess, I gave myself on out to do so, and then she got mad at me because I told her kind of why I did it I wasn't blaming her, but I was telling her you know that's the excuse that I used. So she stopped talking to me and I went in to. Like a major depression, because she's been like my best friend and like almost like a daily thing, even though she lives in Georgia and I. moved from Georgia back in. we've still maintained contact, where we talk to each other, almost every day text you know video call everything like that i've gone out there and visited as many times as I could and stayed there for a week, at a time and stuff like that. And I kind of reverted to one of my other issues which is. Self harm, I was kind of trying to you know as a little screwed up in the head and trying to show her that I was hurting and I sent her a video, and I was sticking needles, through my hand. and She slipped out and she sent the videos to my sister in law, who was I guess sitting next to my brother."
740.0,Provider,And my.
8380.0,Patient,"friend also called the police department and they came out and that was on Halloween. And then I think it was last week. my brother has the power of attorney over my mom and he used it to go file for an eviction notice. to kick me out and. The major problem with that is that I have my kids here which are. So. He doesn't seem to be budging, although I I offered for. You know, to see about getting on those pills that make you sick like, and you know, showing either my sister in law or my mom on a daily basis me taking them or that I would go and get that shot that also makes you sick if you drink. I offered to go to a meetings and my brother wants me to go to Inpatient and I tried to. explain to him well first I don't think that I need impatient when it's not like I have withdrawals and it's I had gotten a long time without drinking and I had gotten everything. straightened out I screwed up for a little while but um you know I have been Okay, since that mess up and I, you know got my myself back straight and I wasn't expecting the. The eviction notice situation. And i'm also not working right now i'm getting. You know the cow fresh food stamps and then the cash a welfare. And as far as I know you can't be in treatment they're not going to pay for your expenses when you're in treatment, I mean I might still be able to get the calfresh for my 15 year old. But I don't think that they would be you know, give me. The welfare if I was in patient and i'm it doesn't seem like anything that I have suggested or told him that I would do has made him happy. So i'm just kind of at a loss as to what to do."
740.0,Provider,"Oh. You started using you stop your friend started which basically means. made you start back and so have you feel, been drinking."
8380.0,Patient,"Good not sense, because the it was how lean and you know, we had a block party going on. And I don't know why I. did what I did you know i've been a cutter in the past and i've done the needle thing in the past, but that was like back in 2015 or 16. i'm going to spend a long time. But it's just from going from having somebody that's there for you every day to. Her not talking to you me, and there was a period of time my sister in law had gotten mad at me and not talking to me, so I was overwhelmed with being like number one."
740.0,Provider,"You know, left to my own devices."
8380.0,Patient,"And then second of all her getting mad at me for essentially doing the same thing that she did. and using her as an excuse, and i'm not sure exactly why she called the police. And I don't think i'd be in this position if it had gone not gotten to that level if she would have just called my sister in law, told me or told her to go check on me and or tell her what was going on. This wouldn't be the situation that it is, and even my mom doesn't agree that I should get kicked out so. she's trying to figure out what to do, also, but he has the power of attorney over her so."
740.0,Provider,"So yeah I mean it sounds like a really, really, really tough situation. What do you have any other option, just in case the war."
8380.0,Patient,"The only option, I would have would be to probably go stay with an ex boyfriend who's been trying to get me back for three years, that I don't want to be with and be 45 minutes away from where my kids are. And a big problem is, as I just got my kids from my. Ex I wasn't a member yeah and. still is, at the point where he wants me to be here when he gets off of school he wants me to pick him up from school and he wants me to bring him to school so i'm worried about that, like devastating him if I can't be here. Because he's still such so shut down like even he was going over to a party. With my niece and. He was going with my other son and my sister in law, they were all going to write together and my oldest offer my youngest to sit shotgun and James said that he's not allowed, because he was never allowed with his dad and michelle's that his mind is still stuck on how things were there. So although you know, he was left to his own devices, and most of the time he had nothing to keep them busy, and all of that he spent most of his time alone. In his room, although he wasn't allowed to shut the door he's allowed to shut and lock the door here. But. He just is still so damaged that we're even just trying to work through him being around people. It was a big step for him to go to the family party. and be around people and it's still even hard for him at home to not stay in his room all the time. which was kind of the reason I asked you about the that trauma. Video that we watched because he's still stuck in that. yeah and I scared that if I were to get. kicked out that he might just. give up and then of course my brother says it's not that far he can walk to school in 40 minutes and i'm afraid i've been afraid this whole time with the way that. My ex was treating him because he's so much like my brother who was an addict for many, many, many years were like I mean there was years where we didn't even know if he was alive or dead, because nobody heard from him. or saw him or anything like that, and he has been sober now I think for 18 years and it seems like he's kind of on one of the high and mighty to. But i'm worried, with everything going on. That my son would either either refuse to go to school, or he would leave and never go to school and that he might get mixed in with the wrong crowd because of this shit that he's been going through and. You know, because that's the same kind of stuff my dad treated. my brother well all of us really. A lot, the same as my ex is and that's what set my brother off, I think he had his first. alcohol poisoning when he was 12 you know and that's when his. His problems started and lasted into his 30s. So i've always worried that the way that my ex was treating my son, he would have already turned to drugs being that he's. or alcohol luckily that hasn't happened yet. But. I don't know i'm trying to figure out what to do, but I really don't think that impatient is. Quite right for me because I don't you know, he says, like I need to detox, and all this stuff and i'm like well you know it's like December, now that happened at the end of October. And I don't think I need to detox. And I you know I offered to go to more meetings I have you as a therapist I have another therapist I have shauntel is you know. That I meet with once a month, you know and with the meds plus group and then offering to go to a so I don't know."
740.0,Provider,"You know this is, this is what I will say right and and, and I say this, all the time and group because of the fact, mind you, you know. edition is not a joke i've been I mean i've been i've been in the news for the past seven years it'd be saving as if it were there, so my life is a chemical dependency right that's what I specializing I know I know, like the back of my hand."
8380.0,Patient,Right.
740.0,Provider,"And so the thing about it is that addiction is not a joke. And the one thing I will say is this. Is there you know. It is. It is one of those things, I mean yeah you were complying with group, but I haven't seen you since October. And I was wondering why you stopped coming to. This you don't want to come on oh."
8380.0,Patient,"I kind of went into a depression, you know after that and. I don't know why I kept missing my alarms because I have, I have alarm set all day. long and I I would you know skip group one week and come the next week, I think there was two times that I I got a miss group two weeks in a row."
740.0,Provider,room. One on one to me.
8380.0,Patient,yeah I think I had to cancel our last one there's so much been going on with me trying to you know go through the the cow works and looking for a job and getting straightened out and just like all this stuff with my kids you know still adjusting. i'd have to look back on my calendar and see when we were scheduled for because I don't remember if I cancelled or if I missed it.
740.0,Provider,"Oh it's fine, but one thing I will say if we create a plan that your brother approved the up to speed with a plan."
8380.0,Patient,"Right well and I even offered for my sister in law, because she comes over usually like three times a week. And I said. That I would even like i'm sure on Amazon or something online that they have the kits that you can buy at home to do urine test, and I even offered to do that, and even that wasn't good enough, it was like he's not budging that all. And nothing that I do seems to."
740.0,Provider,"You know, but basically he wants you add but here's the thing."
8380.0,Patient,"Right, but then my mom 78 years old. and has you know, problems with dementia it's not like progressive. it's mostly she had some damage to the brain. First, from having water on the brain and then she had gotten pneumonia really bad and she wouldn't go to the doctor. And I finally needed her go and within 45 minutes of going to the doctor I was at the er and they had her on a ventilator for a week, and there was some brain damage because of the lack of oxygen. she's telling me that she can't. handle the kids you know my kids are screwed up, and you know they even challenged me and she doesn't she says that she can't. handle the kids by herself but he's telling me that my mom said that she said that i'm killing her and that she can't handle me, but she says that she didn't say that so. I can't."
740.0,Provider,"Everybody needs to sit down at one time. Like everybody needs to sit there, like all day he say she say back and forth everybody needs to sit down at one time and everybody needs to talk about and again on the same page. Oh wow so sister brother you mother are y'all need to sit in and talk about it. and get on the same page. Everybody needs to collect them to talk about it. And everybody on the same page. Because, as I mean, would you mean their mom and would you be in regarding wherever you go they gotta go."
8380.0,Patient,"Right well see and that's what he said, I guess, my sister in law, said that he didn't care if I had to go stay at a shelter and take them with the."
740.0,Provider,"that's ridiculous, which you know I mean that's that's crazy, the fact that. He is treating you as if, as if he's never seen."
8380.0,Patient,Right.
740.0,Provider,"And so I think that is amazing I think they're very, very unfair and i'm deeply sorry that you're in this situation. However, the same time, my thing is that this baby give you a date oh. yeah i'm fan."
8380.0,Patient,"He said he didn't want to kick me out before the holidays, so I have till the January 1."
740.0,Provider,"Okay, so. Do you have. Anybody not the boyfriend not the ex boyfriend but like family members close friends."
8380.0,Patient,"No, because when I had screwed up back in. July, when I was working for that lady or previous August, when I split my head open. I had just started talking to my dad again, who I hadn't spoken to since 2014 so now he. my brother follows right along the same guidelines, I guess, or that he's the same tip movement as my father, so my dad said that he doesn't want to talk to me till i've been sober for a year and. When he's not speaking with you we've all i'm on my second time of not speaking to him for years, all three of us kids have gone twice through that where you're. not allowed to to contact him until he satisfied, you know I had to bring him up my certificates for putting myself through the different programs and drug and alcohol abuse classes and shown my. My license for becoming an aesthetician and all of this stuff to prove myself to him and he started talking to me again, but now we're back to that and when he isn't speaking to you, nobody on that side of the family. is allowed to so I don't have anybody on my dad's side, I have my sister in law, who seems to be a lot more compassionate about it, I have my brother. And then the only other two people on I have is my aunt and uncle who live here, but they would never allow me to be there because they had adopted two children because they couldn't adopt and they were both screwed up with parents that lost them. Due to abuse and addiction. And both of them ended up screwed up and they kick them out, and my uncle is close with my brother. Actually, my brother's one that's getting his inheritance because he's not giving it to his adopted kids so. I don't have anywhere to go really."
740.0,Provider,No.
8380.0,Patient,"not really I mean I have my best friend, but. there's no room at her house, she has her mom living with her. her daughter stays over quite often and then she has one of her daughters friends renting the other room in the House. He knows all this that's why he said that he didn't care if I had to go to the shelter. And even though I told them I had. an interview I had an interview on Monday. And they're supposed to let me know by the end of the week. And i'm still doing the you know the cal jobs and i'm in the welfare to work Program. so that I can receive my benefits and all of that stuff it's just nothing's good enough."
740.0,Provider,"But basically, is not even because of the fact that you, you have been wanting us from the giggle."
8380.0,Patient,It seems like it. He that's what it sounded like to me.
740.0,Provider,"Because i'm like from a person who's been in recovery you i'm saying you will have sympathy on somebody because you understand that you've been there once upon a time. But the fact that you to us, and the fact that you're not even trying to be merciful there, let me, let me know is a therapist you know i'm saying and i'm letting you know that he didn't want to us as the beginning it. Because of it if you came birds were a if you came birds with sponsorship, if you came merge with you i'm saying intensive outpatient could that's what this program is it's an intensive outpatient. Young fan and other kind of stuff, and so this if nothing that you're saying is working images messages once you add. So I don't think it has anything to do with the usage, I think the I think he used the usage as a reason to do what he asked what he's always wanted to do from the beginning."
8380.0,Patient,Right.
740.0,Provider,"Now, would it sound like to me with me. yeah."
8380.0,Patient,"Because I I thought that he would be more understanding, you know, and it would he said he is you know. The reason that he he says he was like the only reason I was able to get clean is because I went to jail, and so my mom's like well, what are you trying to say what she needs to go to jail like she needs to go get in trouble for something good to jail, to be able to get sober. and yeah I mean i've been thinking that. for whatever reason he he wants me out just because, and I don't know why because there's nobody else to take care of my mom you know she's at the point where she has to wear one of those fall buttons you know and. I don't know what else he expects me to do i've tried everything and I thought that you would be more compassionate and the only thing is, and he's like well why, why are you just now coming up with this that whatever and. I I told him I said, actually, you know christy and I talked with my sister in law, a while ago about me offering to take urine tests and we just never went through with it and. You know. As far as the the a you know, I was in an abusive isolated relationship. So, for the first many years, I mean I didn't even look people in the face, I didn't like going out in public, I still don't like when you're in public. I have problems with large groups of people and so that's why I didn't do a. I did get a little comfortable when I put myself through the drug and alcohol counseling class but it's. Mostly, because it was the same people every week, and it was a small."
740.0,Provider,class.
8380.0,Patient,"You know, there was like 12. People and. You know, there was the the the therapist or whatever you call them that run those classes and I was able to handle it. it's just frankly I mean going to in a meeting scares me but i'm kind of at that point and I, and I, and I said well you know, maybe this is rock bottom and he says, you haven't seen rock bottom and i'll show you rock bottom or something like that. So I guess he thinks that I need to get to rock bottom to get straight and. I don't think everybody needs to hit rock bottom. I mean, I think, enough of you know. worrying about being kicked out in my kids not having me here, having nowhere to stay losing the money that helps support them and myself, you know, looking at losing my car looking at losing everything. ruining my credit again, which you know I had to file bankruptcy, years ago, because all the the the credit card debt was in my name is I was stupid and my ex had bad credit. So. You know that's enough of a wake up call to mean to say that I would do these things, but my guess he doesn't consider that rock bottom, I guess, when you're homeless and sleeping in the park or whatever. is the only thing that he considered rock bottom."
740.0,Provider,"hmm well it's only and we have time to figure some things out. I one thing I will say is to try to live into resources. is not called. A shelter is called trends sober living so Scott civilian living housing. Right, and so they allow people to go there, I mean they allow people to go there. who are trying to be sober. Mind clean, I actually have a patient she mentioned sober living housing, right now, and so they do have, though, and so just kind of like I do is as the Google and we started sober living housing area. My and then. You can reach out to one event and see if there were, I mean reach out to some of them and see what their requirements are. Close to you, where you can say. Because my thing is like this, I mean, as long as you have some places, most of the House, you can still get up and take your words go you'd have to you'd have to joplin Missouri home. Like I mean, and they have so we'll even have everywhere. So. Just look into that. And i'm sure. That they were really kind of ease hopefully ease your shoulders a little bit in regards to where to go, but they do have transitional housing for people who want to be sober now listen you can't use, you can generate. If you do it, they won't kick you out. Okay, so just listen to sober living in your area and then collect all those numbers and just talk Allah."
8380.0,Patient,Okay.
740.0,Provider,"Okay, and i'm here if you need me."
8380.0,Patient,"All right, I appreciate it. Thank you so much."
740.0,Provider,"To see. and efficient. Okay, all I wish everything well for you."
8380.0,Patient,Thank you. bye bye.
