14350.0,Patient,I know it. sounds. Like medicine.
298.0,Provider,"Okay yeah they put you on something that's too addictive I don't want to do that to you. let's try something lighter that's not addictive, and that you can only take it as you need it i'm not saying that I know what the perfect medicine is but. This medicine does work for some people for sleep, it may work for you, but if it doesn't you need to tell me and i'll get you something different. You can cut the tablet in half and try half a tablet you can take one tablet or you can take two tablets, but let me know what it took to get you to sleep, it takes time for this to work so like take it like an hour to two hours before you want to go to sleep does that make sense.
