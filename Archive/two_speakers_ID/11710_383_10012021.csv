11710.0,Patient,hi.
383.0,Provider,nice to see you. How are you doing.
11710.0,Patient,"Think I think i'm good i'm on a higher dose of medication so i'm pretty tired in the mornings, because i'm getting used to it, but as i've been okay i'm having a hard time sleeping trillion."
383.0,Provider,So that's kind of probably going to be that's I would imagine that's a bit challenging because you. You feel like the medications thinking you lethargic in the morning and you're not sleeping very well.
11710.0,Patient,"yeah i'm before I was on the medication, I was able to sleep through the night, but I just it was really hard for me to fall asleep, but now I can fall asleep, but I wake up like twice a night so. Pretty annoying but um but shauntel said she wasn't sure. If it's because my medication, or what because she said it shouldn't affect my sleep so."
383.0,Provider,"I do notice that your ruminating about something in particular, or you have. Do you have things that that wake you up worries or something on your mind."
11710.0,Patient,"um no nothing specific I was just wake up, though, and I feel. Like like immediately, I feel kind of stressed out like i'm just thinking about. Like my day like Oh, I have all these things to do, but not really something specific."
383.0,Provider,"Okay. How are you doing in terms of during the day. Like before you go to sleep, do you feel like okay i've gotten got a lot done today and i'm going to relax and read and i'm satisfied with my day now i'm transitioning. Or do you type tend to like be busy up until shortly before you go to bed, and then. what's your pattern in that regard."
11710.0,Patient,i'm usually i'm pretty busy up until I got a bad so yeah it's like I don't really have time to. relax I guess I just kind of go straight to bed. yeah.
383.0,Provider,"Okay, so you might want to think about that pattern and seeing if you can do something. That is along the lines of creating. A boundary between your active self you know doing things whether it's school work or work or reading. Something related to school homework. The that you put a time frame on that that you stop at a certain time and then after that. You you aren't doing those like activating type of things. You know that you're doing unwind and type of things that you're doing enjoyable things like if you're like you know I don't know you could paint your toenails or you know turn some music on. Have like some kind of leisure book that you're reading or magazine."
11710.0,Patient,"yeah I. I think that'd be a good idea I think my issue is just i'm still pretty anxious about the day like I try to schedule my day out and it's hard, because I don't really have anything scheduled like for work. I can just work pretty much whenever and same thing for school and so trying to make my own schedule. I feel like once I start sticking to it, then I feel anxious like i'm working right now i'm not doing schoolwork or the other way around, and then and I just I always mess up with my schedule, I feel so anxious about everything, but just sticking with it would help me. not do it so late during the day. Because that really waste like a time my time."
383.0,Provider,"mm hmm. So let me just make sure I understand what you just said that you sometimes don't adhere to the schedule that you initially set out for yourself. But you. I mean, I heard that you said you don't really have a schedule that it's pretty much up to you. To set a schedule. And then you feel like you're not adhering to what needs to be done."
11710.0,Patient,"yeah I just I feel overwhelmed with everything that I have and knowing that. I could pretty much pick out when I do everything it's just I feel overwhelmed and I feel like I will put it off. Because it's just so much and so i'll just kind of like sit on my phone or something and then i'm like okay I just need do it, and I just end up wasting a bunch of time."
383.0,Provider,So you're kind of procrastinating.
11710.0,Patient,yeah okay.
383.0,Provider,"So it sounds like you do that you're on the right track with thinking of like Okay, I need to schedule my time. and stick to it."
11710.0,Patient,yeah that's that's the hardest part.
383.0,Provider,yeah. well. Again sort of bracketing time can help like you can say okay from one to or from nine to 12 I do work stuff and before nine I have breakfast and I go on a walk and then at noon i'm going to go to the gym. i'm just throwing this out here and and and so that work time is sort of bracketed by a few things that you enjoy that you're going to look kind of look forward to maybe.
11710.0,Patient,yeah.
383.0,Provider,"And then get back to Okay, then i'm going to come back and i'm going to work on my schoolwork until four. You know or five or and then i'm going to go meet a friend, you know or i'm going to if I don't have a friend of me i'm going to go in another walk. or i'm going to go grocery shopping or something that you like look, you would enjoy doing, because the thing about the phone is it's it's giving something to you it's sort of even though it's not it's kind of entertaining or it's some somehow a break from those demands."
11710.0,Patient,Yes.
383.0,Provider,If you can give yourself a break from those demands doing things that you enjoy. But bracket that and put in the middle of it. tasks that need to get done but have that much time limited so. You see what i'm saying.
11710.0,Patient,"yeah I think that would help a lot, because I think a lot of the time I just scheduled like work in school and. Just was like my whole days really stressful."
383.0,Provider,"yeah, we have to schedule things for ourselves that we like doing, and you can even put that on your calendar like you know and thinking ahead of that okay what Okay, this weekend is coming up do I have anything on my calendar that would look forward to doing. And if you don't you know you want to get something on your calendar, that you would enjoy but likewise go for the week to you know. And then, so you have some brac so so that your schoolwork time is. completed or you've allowed enough time for it and then in the evening you can actually have unwind time that. That is going to help your nervous system to relax because if you're activated with stuff you've got to do like homework studying writing a paper until 10 or 11 o'clock at night, and then you turn the light out to try to go to sleep. it's it's not a good recipe for success."
11710.0,Patient,yeah.
383.0,Provider,"yeah take it from someone who knows i'm very, very I tend to be like a highly activated person, so I struggle, also with. Down turning that down and unwinding and let's relax now and. so that you can go actually relax into sleep."
11710.0,Patient,"yeah I think I think sometimes I almost feel guilty for like taking time to myself, so I feel like i'm on the exam productive right now."
383.0,Provider,"yeah well you're judging yourself and. This is not a culture of relaxation at all it's like you could work 24 seven and no I mean it's just not built into. The system, but we have to build it in, you have to build it in yourself and and detach disengage from that those judgments, but if you are procrastinating all day on your phone, it is going to be harder because you're going to feel like well I haven't. I haven't done the things that I need to do so now i'm trying to relax you know. You have to still have to fit in the the responsibilities. yeah to make that relaxation kind of effective."
11710.0,Patient,"yeah i've been trying to be better with my phone, because I feel like just always on it so and I try to like put it away when i'm doing school stuff so."
383.0,Provider,"Okay, good, and do you put your phone like do you have like a place to put it at night."
11710.0,Patient,I just have it next to my bed at night.
383.0,Provider,yeah some people recommend that you put it in another room. At night.
11710.0,Patient,"Well, I just I use the alarms on it."
383.0,Provider,How is therapy going with your with your. Individual therapist she come back from vacation and.
11710.0,Patient,"Oh yeah that's been going well i'm actually going twice a month now, instead of every week. No i'm so like i've been doing good, and I want to talk about that a little too because. i've been thinking about the program and I don't know if it's working for me anymore like I don't know if I can commit to it. I just think i'm in kind of a better place and I don't like need as often. yeah and so i've been thinking about finding new psychiatrists but just a little overwhelming because i'm on the medication now but. But yeah I don't know."
383.0,Provider,"yeah maybe your therapist has. Has a referral for you, for a psychiatrist in the Community, where you where you live."
11710.0,Patient,"Okay, I haven't thought of asking her."
383.0,Provider,"yeah You might ask her you might just give her a phone call and just say you know. or your insurance, do you have medical or are you on different insurance."
11710.0,Patient,um yeah it's medical i'm on. The health plan of smoking.
383.0,Provider,"Okay um. You yeah I don't know. I mean, we could see if we could put you in touch with some referrals in your area, if you want to discharge from bright heart health and and. be referred to another provider, I could put a request in for that."
11710.0,Patient,yeah that would be great.
383.0,Provider,"Okay, I will work on that. and i'm glad you're feeling better."
11710.0,Patient,"Thank you yeah. i've been i've been doing good, I think I have a lot of stuff to look forward to."
383.0,Provider,that's excellent. And how are things going with your mom.
11710.0,Patient,"pretty much the same, I mean. I don't know it's hard to not have her affect me but still, you know drinking, the same but. it's just like little things I noticed, I guess, like. Like I went to a concert on Sunday as a lot of fun, it was really good getting out, and I was gone for the night. And I come back and she was even asked me about it, like and then I start sharing your pictures and stuff and she just kind of starts talking about herself and she just kind of act like she didn't really care that much or she just had like negative stuff to say. yeah so that's kind of a bummer because i'm like Oh, she says, I was, like everything in my life like she never really cares what's going on in my life like slowly throughout her. yeah."
383.0,Provider,"And you keep giving her these you know you keep trying i'm carrying you know you showing her pictures, or you keep trying to share and get that disappointed."
11710.0,Patient,"yeah. yeah i've been trying to. I haven't really been talking to her much, but I was really excited about the concerts I was, I thought she would be to start kind of surprised on this is generally care that much fun."
383.0,Provider,"Maybe she doesn't really know how to show you that she cares. That could be part of it, you know that she's really not skilled and communication."
11710.0,Patient,yeah. I could definitely see her.
383.0,Provider,"yeah and she has gotten into a pattern of in a way, like using you to talk to about her son her stuff. that's something that you've mentioned in the past that she talks to you about her relationships and things like that that you don't feel very appropriate. yeah so i'm glad you got you can talk about this with your therapist out of outside of by her health, and you guys talk about your relationship with your mom."
11710.0,Patient,yeah yeah I have been I just saw her yesterday.
383.0,Provider,"Okay, good good Okay, well, I am going to put an inquiry here for. For blaine i'm going to add shauntel. That you are requesting, to be discharged and to be referred to another provider for your medications."
11710.0,Patient,yeah.
383.0,Provider,And then they'll probably get back to you about that. Are you you're 100 you're sure you want to move in this direction.
11710.0,Patient,"yeah. yeah i've been. i've been thinking about it for a while and I just yeah I just like I can't commit to like the group's anymore, and it being online to it's kind of sucks."
383.0,Provider,"Well i'm glad you're feeling better and i'll put this in for for for our team to see what we can do in terms of finding a referral, and then you can maybe also ask your therapist. If she has any recommendations, you can also go to the county of San Joaquin and see if there's any you know their mental health. Page see if there's any referrals there or through your insurance, you know, I think, but we probably can give you a few names as well, through breitbart hell."
