706.0,Provider,"yeah I mean we've got a lot. uh huh we we've got husbands and wives that both do bright heart girlfriends and boyfriends friends, you know. it's um there's no policy that says that you can't have a sibling or. Significant other or anything. that's also a part of the Program."
3832.0,Patient,"Okay, well, I mean if I have to i'll say he's my boyfriend."
706.0,Provider,know you can have a sibling it's fine unless you want to.
3832.0,Patient,laugh at me right now. But yeah I like that from he's he's really a fun why man it's just awesome so for a little bit. Well yeah I did.
706.0,Provider,"You lose yourself, because you the drugs takeover and you lose yourself and then you lose the control that you had in your life and then you have to take it back."
3832.0,Patient,"line and really I mean, I think, with him, running with me, I think you would be able to get his confidence. is true this relationships everything, like all back together a lot faster. You know if. If I just getting understand that I am very good sport person, you know so."
706.0,Provider,"What could you been there. And you know it makes it makes a huge. Difference anybody can say oh do this or do this or do this, but unless you've been there and you've been through it. You can relate on a whole different level when you've."
3832.0,Patient,"been through it. And then, it was like you know, like how sometimes like you know, two people are toxic together something but. It was like me and him was. The the type to. To do drugs like that, together, nothing you know, we were all social people that kind of just socialize a yeah let's do that. All right, you know what I mean. But that was on time with."
706.0,Provider,relationship so you don't have to worry about driving each other down because that was never your thing.
3832.0,Patient,"yeah that's that's where I was yeah whatever that term is but that's exactly what i'm talking about. yeah I know I shouldn't be a trigger for him, he can't be a trigger for me."
706.0,Provider,"Good. I mean that's good that's. that's perfect I mean that's a perfect kind of support relationship that you both need um you know and he's very early and do his recovery, so it will be tough. And you know when he decides if and when he wants to get into a program that will just make things, all the more smooth for him in his recovery journey, because then. there's."
3832.0,Patient,"Well, let me say about him too low, because he's done a lot of programming he's done a lot of incarceration time to. what's the. I think that's. That was my problem is finding a I guess a structure that I was comfortable with opening up to. me and I just. Did jubilation and so scenario which is perfect, like everything just kind of put me man timing, I can be here all the time, I can call the time I can, yes, you know set appointment. You know this is this is me so it's like you know fine finding that for him is is guess where i'm trying to get into now. Well, you know because."
706.0,Provider,"It has to be a good fit you know so like if virtual treatment works for him if he thinks that will work for him. Then I would say yeah bright heart is something to definitely. Give a try some people need more support than that. You know, we have people that come into our Program. That aren't successful because they can't stay in. Compliance because they need, you know, a higher level of care, then we can give a bright heart because we're virtual. And then we have to refer them. To somebody else."
3832.0,Patient,So yeah I mean. Moving forward but yeah I hope to get this truck sold and get into another one tonight I did find a an older gentleman selling one. yeah and he's he's kind of farm on his price because it's it's really a solid truck. So.
706.0,Provider,"Well, anyway. People can be firm on their prices because there's a lack of inventory to buy there's a lack of vehicles out there to buy. And they're typically priced a little bit higher than they normally would be, because there is that lack of vehicles. um so a new vehicles to new vehicles oh my gosh they cost so much right now, because there's not very many because they haven't they're still trying to catch up from when they couldn't make the microchips and all that stuff to put in them and all kinds of I mean. it's ridiculous read by the."
3832.0,Patient,Last well I think flip over to electric to I think that's a lot of it too.
706.0,Provider,"Well, I think that that's some of it, too, but I know I have a friend that's a salesman at a car dealership and you know they have a quarter of the inventory on the line that they would normally have because they just can't get vehicles in and I got really lucky because I bought."
3832.0,Patient,are like so many.
706.0,Provider,"Well it's not even that no well as soon as they get them on the laughter selling, but so you get you get all of your vehicles from like the main factories and they ship them in. Well, the factories aren't able to make them because there's a shortage of rubber for tires there's a shortage of these microchips for the backup cams. there's all these shortages. And so, with that happening, plus the Labor the Labor market being so low like people aren't working or you know, whatever it may be. The issue there is is they're not making the vehicles to ship to the dealerships so then they're not getting any new ones in when they sell them. So then, they have all these vehicles that are sitting on the lat just a few of them and then there and then, when they're gone like there's nothing to come back in so it's been. it's been challenging and so what he was telling me is that your vehicles your new vehicles usually you can. talk down the price a little bit you know you can pay under book typically. On a new vehicle if they want to sell it like they'll negotiate the price, but now they're selling for he's got four or $5,000 over sticker price because there's it's supply and demand, you know there's more of a demand than there is a supply so they don't have to drop their price. So you know."
3832.0,Patient,it's yeah some of that stuff is overrated I don't understand like how some people can even pay the prices like really.
706.0,Provider,"Oh no oh I oh trust me, I know I just bought a 2021 for to explore new dress me I really questioned myself when when I did that, because it's very expensive it's like you should be able to live in your vehicle for as much as you pay for it, but. yeah but it, it is what it is so um but The thing is, is that's what. hi."
3832.0,Patient,I said i'm looking at oh nine.
706.0,Provider,yeah well I. yeah.
3832.0,Patient,At least my vehicles.
706.0,Provider,"new vehicles every three years, so. But."
3832.0,Patient,i'm right.
706.0,Provider,"But it is it's about supply and demand and every area, so everything on in the market right now is overpriced foods overprice everything's overpriced. it's just is what. it's where we are right now. And there's a housing shortage and there's all kinds of stuff going on, so."
3832.0,Patient,"This was a lot of coming back, I mean it seems to be coming. It is, I mean i'm. At least you know it it's actually kind of beneficial for me. i'm going away right now. because everybody went off the Internet and stuff now too so."
706.0,Provider,"yeah yeah. Well, and everybody to buy things cheaper so buy things to us like gently used are in good shape, rather than buy a brand new. Which is great for you, because that's your business you're buying things and then reselling them so um you know that's a really you know. Good you know place to be for you. And I do think, I think the economy is coming back I think everything's coming back I think it's been a rough couple of years and it's not going to happen overnight it's going to be a slow process, just like anything. You know, even when you look at like your you know, a substance use disorder, you know you didn't. The person that you were when when you were actively using overnight. You know you just didn't it just didn't it will you know wake up one morning and do like I think today i'm going to go and be an addict you know, like it's not a conscious choice you don't just decide to do it and it happens that."
3832.0,Patient,quickly.
706.0,Provider,"You know you start to do something, you make a choice and then before you know it, you have no control over it. You know, and then it's a. slow process to get back to where you were before you lived that active using lifestyle. What life. was like."
3832.0,Patient,"Right now, that it's like now i'm here and we're back to this point it's like that I don't really do that i'm just. Like oh my God."
706.0,Provider,"it's like living a whole new life it's like. Starting over you know. Because you learn you literally have to learn everything again. You know how do you live life. Without having substances in you, you know when you've done it for so long you're like geez you know they might so different everything looks different people are different, the way you react to people are different. The way they react to you."
3832.0,Patient,See you speed your adrenaline your her. attitude or. I mean just your your ability to want to do better.
706.0,Provider,mm hmm.
3832.0,Patient,just go.
706.0,Provider,"And the planet and the pleasure centers of your brain and the impulsivity centers of your brain they there. Because before what gave you pleasure with drugs now you got to figure out the other things in life that make you happy, but other things that will give you that same feeling without the drugs, you know and that's an exploration for everybody."
3832.0,Patient,"Like I knew this appointment was coming at to today and I was like at 11 o'clock you know me because i'm slow. My condition, but, as I was, like okay guy and get the breaks down and i'm like okay I better make one like 12 and i'm like I get done eating lunch on my medicine it's 130 already like time just. Like i'm like oh my God I call, let me put this together, I wanted to put that there and. hey i'm here."
706.0,Provider,"yeah you made it so but I mean you can just see like that that journey that you've made you, you can look back on it now, and you can see. That journey that you made. But when you're in the moment you're just trying to get through each each day."
3832.0,Patient,"I mean it's day just substance, I mean it was wake up well I gotta get this done today, but I have to go get this."

That was so complicated and so time. consuming and frustrating and but I, but I used to do that now I don't have to you know that's why people when they first stop using they really struggle, because they have nothing but time on their hands that time. used to be used up by figuring out how they were going to get high, and now that they don't have to figure that out anymore, what do you do with all that time."
3832.0,Patient,Because you don't have any.
706.0,Provider,"that's why people struggle in the beginning and that's why it's important to have structure, consistency and fill your time with things to keep your mind off the fact that you're not looking to get hat. You know."
3832.0,Patient,"And so, would you rather."
