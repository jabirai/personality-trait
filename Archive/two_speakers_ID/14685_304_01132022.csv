304.0,Provider,Oh you're gonna you're gonna kill me yeah Thank you so much for coming a little bit earlier yeah it's. Like I should know how to do this better because it's like bright hardest on Pacific time i'm on mountain time and then you guys are on Central time.
14685.0,Patient,"I know. Sometimes, like during set before we had this problem before and I don't know if. i'd be able to ever figure out. So. Anyway, it's good to see you yeah thanks for making the time for us to chat and I know you checked in and everything so."
304.0,Provider,"yeah you've had gosh a lot going on some ups and downs, but are things kind of evening out now."
14685.0,Patient,"yeah yeah I think i'm some of this stuff, as you know, probably, just like healthy stuff that I have to get through. To get to the other end, you know so i'm yeah i'm okay yeah."
304.0,Provider,you're just you're feeling everything now.
14685.0,Patient,I am.
304.0,Provider,you're living life like on life's terms you know if you've heard that before. yeah yeah.
14685.0,Patient,"And i've struggled with I mean i've really struggled with a lot of guilt in the past for. Like the way I raised my kids, and I mean there were times that I was sober and it was great, but there were times when I wasn't and so, and then I have trouble with my kids used and so. It there's such a guilt thing there that. it's it's difficult, sometimes I do a lot better than I did, but sometimes I just have to cry. You know."
304.0,Provider,"yeah okay um you know, and I feel like kind of that that video that we watched in group about the intergenerational trauma. And really getting conscious of that and it's just brave of you Angela like it is, it is so hard, I mean to sit there as a moment say like. yeah I messed up, I was high on drugs, for you know half my kids childhood, or you know, whatever it was we just say like it, it has affected them. Whereas I just that that's painful like that is painful that is hard reality, but you are so much further ahead of it, I mean you know some of the other ladies and group and they're like well it never affected my kids you know they never knew it's like okay."
14685.0,Patient,Everybody knows.
304.0,Provider,"Every. Longer they're in denial of that and the longer it takes them. To get real about how their addiction impacted their kids and then to like to make amends, to move forward and say like I was sick I screwed up. You know, but like here I am. And i'm ready to do better."
14685.0,Patient,"yeah I am I. stayed stuck in that that guilt thing for quite a while, and I know it like drowns you, you know, like It made me stuck like I would just couldn't do anything but either cry or sit and wanted to just like that you know."
304.0,Provider,"But you know the trauma that you went through um you know the trauma and all the emotions and everything that you went through that you were trying to numb through through your drug abuse. You know, passed on to your kids and they they experienced that trauma. At some point, though they're. Like yes, people have been through trauma and, yes, you know that trauma was passed down but at some point, there is still that individual to say, because there are lots of people who are traumatized. or whose parents were drug addicts, or whose parents were not there for them or parents who abused them and they don't become addicted to drugs. So there is, as far as like your guilt, you know, like they are still individuals who who made choices, just like and now you've made the choice to get help. So I can have that choice to. And that's on them, that is their responsibility so it's not. I think there's that difference between like personal responsibility like yes, you take responsibility for your your role and the things you did or didn't do as a mother, but also like there's got to be some of their individual."
14685.0,Patient,"yeah and I understand that I think that it's kind of a fine line between. accepting responsibility for some of it a lot of it. But not living in it, you know. And and and knowing that. i'm making different choices i'm you know living a healthier life and that's my choice that doesn't have anything to do with my dad or my what happened there any any. You know so but that's just me that's all me so it's it's there's a line In between there because I don't want to be one of those people that's like Oh, they were fine it shouldn't matter you know I I can't stand that I hate that when. It really wasn't a big deal no it's a big damn deal, you know so. yeah it's just I don't know I definitely know i'm accepting responsibility that's for sure, but. And I do know that once they become an adult and you know they they need to have their own lives and they have their own minds and they make their own choices. And you know all that it's just getting my head in my heart in the same place that's what it is, I mean my brain knows that I know that I do but it's you know. it's trying to get my head my heartfelt same place so yeah it is."
304.0,Provider,"yeah and you know when we've talked about, like all emotions like you've got to feel your feelings, you have to feel all of your emotions that entire range of emotion and you know these new ideas, this is like a new idea to a lot of people like oh feel my feelings like. Especially in recovery right because. People who are addicted are like nope I don't like that feeling I don't want to feel it."
14685.0,Patient,In another way.
304.0,Provider,"And so now we're telling you to like feel all of your feelings. But, like you, don't have to live there. Like yes, you might feel guilty and no one can tell you, like well don't feel guilty because that's just like saying well don't feel happy, you know that's just another emotion. it's also like you can't live there you feel it and then okay like we're not going to wallow in it and stay in bed all day."
14685.0,Patient,yeah mm hmm. yeah exactly. So.
304.0,Provider,When you know.
14685.0,Patient,easier said than done.
304.0,Provider,"Yes, it's."

14685.0,Patient,"yeah yeah she's not. Well, at all. So. I don't see much over. If she has to pick up or may or something right, if I have to go jumper car or something like that, but. Besides that, I don't see."
304.0,Provider,"How is, how is the boundary for you, if she's meeting something."
14685.0,Patient,"Well, well, she doesn't ask me for money you know um I don't have a problem with that kind of thing with her at all. I mean if she's out in the cool and she needs her card jumped i'm going to jump her car, you know that's I would for anyone. Whether they're using or not, you know it's 20 below zero out so you know things like that and. You know her Mailer will come and I set it up in the mail slot thing that I have and i'll text her and let her know her males here and. She can come and get it if she does she does this she doesn't you know if she misses. Her probation appointment because the letter sitting in my mailbox then she misses it, you know I used to be a lot more like you know blown up her phone you got something from court, and you know I open it and I read it to her now and I don't do all that."
304.0,Provider,Good good.
14685.0,Patient,"yeah i'm doing better with that. So I also used to because she's supposed to be visiting. My grandkids on every weekend she gets a two hour visit and she just doesn't show up so there's several several several times that I have text her and texture and. They get her and that you know, are you a comment or your comment and all that and I, and I don't do that it drives me crazy and it makes me too consumed in that, and then I can't be a good grandma to my grandkids because my head somewhere else you know.
