484.0,Provider,"Okay, good so i'm glad that you did not get cove ID and hope you do not."
17263.0,Patient,know I already had it once it was horrible.
484.0,Provider,"yeah yeah. And how have you been from. suboxone perspective, the past two weeks since I saw you. Last tosh."
17263.0,Patient,Good I get up to go a day without it. yeah.
484.0,Provider,i'm so sorry that happened.
17263.0,Patient,"nothing to do with you guys they're just out I guess. My friend said he had the same problem, but he he ended up getting. pills from him and he he got really sick from taking the pill. He took him for like three or four days and then manage stomach was so messed up from us like, no matter what don't take the pills just go without it i'm telling you okay you're good it's bad. And he's the one that told me to spit that stuff out so that was really sick from it, and then it worked. Right hey said it'll take quick just let it melt all the way through, and just keeping your mouth like."
484.0,Provider,20 minutes and.
17263.0,Patient,"Let it melt no matter you get swish it around but just don't swallow it spit it out, and it goes and it takes away all the eggs and all the withdrawals and stuff but. yeah."
484.0,Provider,Have you had any any so did you have withdrawal that day you didn't get to take your meds.
17263.0,Patient,The worst thing for me is that my legs I don't know why.
484.0,Provider,The restless legs.
17263.0,Patient,yeah i'm starting to wonder if I just had that and. That just takes it away I don't know what.
484.0,Provider,"Well restless legs, is also a common symptom in withdrawal so it's probably the withdrawal you're feeling and it's it's one that I hear often where you get that real like jittery and kind of restless feeling and your legs and so."
17263.0,Patient,"Oh man, a few words I can't sleep. yeah even even quit drinking coffee and because I was having an anxiety, but I haven't had it and so."
484.0,Provider,"Okay, oh yeah that's probably the with it's probably the withdrawal that was causing the restless legs and particularly did it go away when you started up the suboxone again."
17263.0,Patient,Oh immediately.
484.0,Provider,"yeah so you probably. You might have let restless leg syndrome, but I don't think so because suboxone is not a treatment for restless leg syndrome it's different medications we use so if you're taking the suboxone and. don't have any of those feelings and I don't think you have like actual restless leg syndrome, I think it's just that withdraw."
17263.0,Patient,yeah I don't have one so. It must just be there yeah.
484.0,Provider,"Now what i'm wondering you from a metric perspective is. So we spaced out, we were doing one week we spaced out to two weeks. We can space it out for the further to four weeks if you feel like you're you know I think you're on now like you know we're now the dose that you're staying on, and it seems like you've been doing well on it any concerns about side effects you're having, though."
17263.0,Patient,No it's. It doesn't bother me at all.
484.0,Provider,And for right now you want to stay on this same dose and not try to decrease Is that correct or did you want to try to come down.
17263.0,Patient,"Rather, just stay on it. Maybe for another month and then after that we'll just like drop one a day."
484.0,Provider,"see why wouldn't even drop yeah we would go and we're even waste lower than that, to be honest, just because I wouldn't want you have any withdrawal symptoms."
17263.0,Patient,"Okay, but I just think I kind of would."
484.0,Provider,"want to you and we can i'm happy to take it with you, I just don't want you to tapered so fast that you. have a lot of withdrawal symptoms I don't think that's necessary, I think we could just keep her it slowly by having you cut the films and having we can talk about that, when it gets time for it but. In, particularly since you have chronic pain, I think we would just want to go a little slower and see how you did."
17263.0,Patient,"Well, good."
484.0,Provider,"Because if you just if you took two and a day I mean if you felt fine taken to, and today I mean you may have had to do that when you were running out of mads and if you realize that you felt fine and that's that's one thing, but otherwise I just don't want you to kind of be stuck."
17263.0,Patient,"yeah Okay, I would definitely like to do something, later on, without narcotics propane. yeah."
484.0,Provider,"there's a lot a lot that you can do for pain, besides. opioid medications I mean there's so much."
17263.0,Patient,"Okay ever believe I even say this because I, I mean, even when I had my appendix taken out I. I refuse, well, I add an ex wife and she was really into drugs and. She was clean for like. Eight years and we were living in Boise Idaho. Oh, and. The founder found out she was. taking care of this lady and the lady had when I found out, I went to work with night and. Day my neighbors called me so it was there, and once at your House, so what are you tired, she was actually odeon did not tell me the order to find out there was I left to work to call the ambulance for so. But yeah she site, and it was crazy, I was in the hospital with this parasitism this had surgery and they're releasing me two days after it was pretty bad I mean they cut me really bad where I couldn't hardly walk or anything. wow but I had to get up walk around and get pneumonia and then, when I get ready to lead us in emory write your script. Over biking in no you're not and cheese Dan who would be just oh yeah he's just trying to be a tough guy you want so that's it no I don't know i'm not gonna take them so don't don't write it. yeah okay. But I just knew that she would take them anyways or she would. Well wasn't around, but she almost died."
484.0,Provider,Quite scary.
17263.0,Patient,"yeah. I saw. When I started to my knees. Right hey. I never knew that like I never knew there was a withdraw from it, so I just and then, when my doctor got left here I didn't get to see my my last visit and I started going to I was taking four days like. I started feeling so bad and it's like oh me Oh, I know what's wrong with you like, what is your what draws from the by good now so they don't do that because yeah they do, and so he went and got me one from his dad and I took it and I was like oh my God, so he felt better I was like. yeah so I just I stayed on him and.

Really, I go man, I feel great."
484.0,Provider,"You feel like your. pain is any So if you think back to. You know, two months ago, when you were just taking the progress that you had compared to now do you feel like overall. You your pain is better. And yet you overall feel better. or no."

Then, my knee and my lower back or. yeah so it's but you know I quit I quit I quit drinking coffee and was having headaches and. I got through that and so. But yeah I I do feel more pain, I mean.
