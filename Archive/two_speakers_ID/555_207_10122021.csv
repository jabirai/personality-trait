207.0,Provider,you're muted.
555.0,Patient,Can you hear me now. Just at school about to go in here and take this final but. actually had to go study beforehand.
207.0,Provider,Before. The final.
555.0,Patient,One he gave us some time to study like about 30 minutes. or so starting back in here 30.
207.0,Provider,you're going to say final final for that class or just want to let the problem.
555.0,Patient,"By now, for the class semifinals all this week's I took my math final yesterday and today is my biology tomorrow's my foundations and Thursday is my pharmacology. So this."
207.0,Provider,For medical nursing.
555.0,Patient,yeah. Here yeah.
207.0,Provider,i'm.
555.0,Patient,"Good, this is the first quarter so that's basically these mentors are these finals determine your overall grade of passing the class so. And kind of stressful."
207.0,Provider,How was it yesterday.
555.0,Patient,"Maggie I mean math is all right, it was just kind of tricky I like the. dosage calculation with like kids wait, you have to convert their pounds two kilograms then multiply what like the safe dose and, like the minimum does Max dose and then, if it's therapeutic or. A safe dose if it's not then you had to fit that it's not the blood then sometimes you have to convert it into two like you do the minimum and Max so you just multiply the minimum amount that doctor says is a minimum amount, I guess, and then. Once you get the answer for that, then you divide it into two if it's like asking for two doses so it's kind of difficult as a lot of steps. And sometimes they can get a little hard you know, trying to decide. Like if it's here I mean what steps you have taken us a little tricky but I never I hate fractions there is a lot of functions on their. Milan."
207.0,Provider,"been doing, have you been really on. Like even before now i'm studying went over the weekend. You. Know school was not my metaphor nursing school is something that you, you almost have to study all the time."
555.0,Patient,"yeah. Really, a lot because um. I don't know you just got to cover a lot like at this school, though they kind of screwed us on one of the classes pharmacology where it's supposed to take pharmacology until after we don't bio because a lot of the biology, it has a lot to do with pharmacology like. The anti diuretic hormone that our body has a nurse, you know it in us that regulates body or not body, but the water. That is absorbed or whatever put out like that. We learned in the beginning of pharmacology but didn't really know much about it there's a lot of things that we learned in there that didn't know much about, but we learned in biology later on. So the teacher was like yeah we did a meeting and we realized that you guys should have checked by pharmacology first, you should get violent in pharmacology and blah blah. blah we're all stressed out about our grades because, like in the beginning, we were we were at the whole class was like felling, we were getting bad grades and test. Some of the stuff that we were going over was even on the test, and she swore up and down, it was like last our last as. She told us, you know study the package that is a packet so when we get the test the first 10 questions. were like questions that we didn't even see on the package and she's like Oh, we went over it in class, I mean every day, you know I mean so. it's like it's stressful it really, especially when you have people that work here that it's like the school itself, I mean it is a good school, but then again it's like they go through teachers like crazy."
207.0,Provider,one.
555.0,Patient,"This particular teacher, though, I think that she's having like early alzheimer's or something, because she. The other day she almost like a student retake a midterm with an open book. swearing up and down that everyone else got to do that and got to retake the midterm and we're all saying no we did, and we got our grade that we got we didn't get to retake it. So then she goes and gets like a packet out of the thing and she's like adamant that that we got to retake it and we're all telling her no we didn't. So then she goes and grabs it she started naming out random names and we're like why and she's like I know this is your class. And the name some other names are like those are not even knowing that's not anybody in this class and then she finally realized that i'm like what the hell and then she sometimes she'll say things and like not remember saying them like it's really weird but."
207.0,Provider,everybody on board to the attentional cool.
555.0,Patient,"yeah mommy I told me like you need to let her know Whenever she says they just reminder or you know you guys need to speak up if she's doing test and it's not the you guys whatever you need to let her know like I don't remember going over this one day we go over this. So we did let her know a couple times and. And just really doesn't make a difference, I mean apparently I mean that is that I don't know I don't know what's going on with that whole situation I think it's stupid, but. A lot of people don't want to speak up either, so the people that do like me and a couple other girls it's like only a few of us so it's like they kind of disregarded because of that, you know I mean."
207.0,Provider,um.
555.0,Patient,"I guess it's only because our grades bad that we're doing this every complaining. And it's not that he has, I mean, I have an ad in her class and that mean that's not a good grain, because I saw the final to take, but it's not a bad one, so it's not that she's."
207.0,Provider,"Oh, you need a B or B to pass the class you're not alone nothing for your you know love to get a feeling you. Know yeah."
555.0,Patient,"yeah and 80 and 80 is passing and where's the school and alias passing. I don't know how that whole calculation is i'm not real sure cuz I never understood it when they're explaining it on our syllabus but you had to get a certain amount so 200 points, all together, is what you get in that class and he had to have 180 points out of that 200 to pass. So. Here in 80s and see but every other places it's really a be basically. Then they want us to get the shot the coverage shot before clinical next next quarter and, unlike terrified. of getting it so. i'm like i've been bullshitting that is going to get them a donor shawn Carter day."
207.0,Provider,Well that's what you're planning on doing.
555.0,Patient,It yeah my mom and my sister and everyone got them if they're in a mom did have pulmonary embolism in a heart attack almost.
207.0,Provider,"I mean, she was admittedly."
555.0,Patient,"yeah after taking the shot like a couple months after taking when I was a month after taking the second shot she got a pulmonary embolism and caught it before it killed her. And then she had since been in our heart and I she was getting the cast, but in our heart to check out how much blockers she had she was having a heart attack on the table so."
207.0,Provider,i'm having some getting the vaccine.
555.0,Patient,"yeah well her doctor says it's from Kobe he thinks is from coven because you know, he said that it could be from the shot, but I don't know I disagree, because there's so many people dying from blood clots and stuff from after having the shot."
207.0,Provider,um so wow. So that's what so you had some concerns about. Getting a shot.
555.0,Patient,"yeah yes, because I mean. I smoke, I am you know i'm not the healthiest i've been gaining weight recently I like I don't know there's factors that play a part in like why i'm scared to get it, and I mean but. I mean I don't know."
207.0,Provider,So. Even don't have to do. don't you have to do. What do you have a free get accepted into the nursing Program.
555.0,Patient,What.
207.0,Provider,Medical evaluation.
555.0,Patient,yeah.
207.0,Provider,"And I think it's just looking at it from the perspective of you know. talking to your own doctor. In terms of your own health. concerns and, yes, that is there that makes you question some data will say you know, the amount of people that have had negative side effects from getting whichever one of the shots and the other data that states that you have more people who. get through. Without having a negative side effects, you have the percentage is greater than. Most people surviving or not getting hospitalized, so I think it's just really. Speaking to your own doctor your primary and getting their unbiased opinion about it and finding out which one is best for you, because there are different you're different arm."
555.0,Patient,there's Pfizer and then there's Madonna those are only two i'm willing to take.
207.0,Provider,"If anything i'm Ben Johnson, no more."
555.0,Patient,"I mean there is but Johnson and Johnson has been known to have a really bad effect on people and I don't think they stopped it, but a lot of people aren't. Given Johnson and Johnson because of that so like my pharmacy only has been done in Pfizer there's only two that they have Pfizer though there's from the ages of 13 to. 30 you have a risk of having inflammation of the heart, because a 13 year old actually died from it, he had gotten the shot I guess the last shot and that saved from having too much water i'm sorry."
207.0,Provider,With with with with one.
555.0,Patient,But taking the Pfizer shy.
207.0,Provider,"yeah and I saw that and I know that they talked about that on them and I actually thought about a few be a few days ago, a week ago, maybe I did see that, but they said, according to them, they said that it was very. Minimal thing for you. I think, for that they do, but i'm. Again, just to do your own due diligence, because at the end of the day, I can take tylenol you could take tylenol and i'll end up on a bad migraine and you don't you understand so. If an individual basis."
555.0,Patient,Right.
207.0,Provider,"Oh. No, I, it is no cause of concern um you. And I had it was a walk in the park, is what I would say my husband had it and it was not a walk in the."
555.0,Patient,"morning only thing I had issues with was breathing like. I still do it like I take me deeper breaths because it's hard for me to take small ones, and of course it's from smoking and I really don't understand why I still do I need to work on it honestly but, like, I do have to breathe a really, really deep now."
207.0,Provider,"You have to. You said I don't see I don't know why I still smoke, but I have to you have to you have to be able, and maybe this is what you can do. Is identify every time you go and pick up a cigarette what is the motive, what is the what is the reason, what is the push is it do you find that you have increased anxiety and what is that invited for rounding when you call."
555.0,Patient,"It typically is what i'm really like it. I have a lot of anxiety like right now i'm like really stressed now and. about this test, because I have to get 33 questions right how to. To pass this class and it's like I mean that's that means I can get 17 questions wrong and I don't want to get that, like, I want to be able to know this stuff because next next next quarter. is going to be anatomy and stuff and you have to know this, to be able to get through that here I mean so it's like. I don't know so whenever I came out from now like, I want to just figure out because my nerves are bad. I need to figure out different ways, which I will, because I have to quit smoking before clinical is anyway it's like they. They said, you cannot smell like smoke when you come into clinical, as you can because there's a lot of people that can be either. They can be exacerbated by the smell of it, and it can cause problems, so you can't smoke can't do like any of that the whole day and that means i'd be. I can't smoke that whole entire day up until like three o'clock so i've been appointed something anyways you know I mean. that's a whole entire freakin eight hours without a cigarette So if I can get that far I can get the whole damn day, so I had to quit beforehand anyway, so I got to get that down."
207.0,Provider,"it's identified in one another thing that you can incorporate in your maybe daily routine now that you're in school because school. Naturally, and I think it's coming into understanding that naturally being in school taking tests and all of that it comes with its own bout of anxiety right that that's just something natural and normal. So maybe something one thing that you can incorporate is doing some mindfulness exercises doing Listening to some meditation type of. Music, or something that helps to calm you to Center you, because the truth of the matter is it increases our anxiety, with the past, because it's fear of failing. that's what increases our anxiety is the fear of failing, and when you fear the when your anxiety comes up because you fear failing, then what it causes you to do is forget all the information you know, and then it makes you second gesture so. You already know it, and then, if you know that you've put in the time to really review and studying the material it's just doing that so before you start testing. before you start studying I recommend doing some mindful exercises doing some like Listening to some meditation go on YouTube they have that stuff on YouTube taking a deep breath and just listening to the mindful exercises on YouTube put in mind for meditation on anxiety. medication for anxiety."
555.0,Patient,"yeah right and that's i'm gonna do because I am. i've been really, really stressed out lately."
207.0,Provider,"So listen close that and if you find right before you, you you start studying studying you do that. right before your test you do that, so what i'll say is like right now just do a little bit of review don't do too much don't try to cram everything in there. Just review the thing that you know for sure your soul and bit shaky on right before you go into your test, you know just listen to some calming music. And then you just go in and take your test, because if you allow your anxiety to be so elevated then it's not going to allow you to stay focused on the question then you're going to quit second guess everything."
555.0,Patient,Right right.
207.0,Provider,"Okay let's see Let me try, let me try to get you another for next month. You say you are you're only able to do new appointment sure I."
555.0,Patient,think so because I mean i'm pretty sure it's been our lunches i'm hoping next quarter to be a lifetime. it's up in the air with next quarter them it's the days get mixed up and I did have Fridays off now i'm gonna have like Wednesdays and Thursdays on sorry time I don't know.
207.0,Provider,"What do you want instead of these cans on scheduling do you want to find out when you're scheduling for next month, and for your next quarter and then you just call it scheduling scheduling at that time."
555.0,Patient,um yeah that's fine.
207.0,Provider,yeah so do call and schedule at that time since we're on monthly anyway. Especially for that okay.
555.0,Patient,yep Thank you.
207.0,Provider,you're welcome.
