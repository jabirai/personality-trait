105.0,Provider,"It happens, you know I try, I know, everybody feel so it's so strange for me to have people repeat back the appointments. right but there's real utility to it and."
14847.0,Patient,"I repeated it and, for some reason I you know, even if even the date. again tomorrow, was the 28th and not today and I don't know why that's mine."
105.0,Provider,"So today's the 29th. But let's take a minute and tell me a little bit about where you are right now, because you do seem like you're moving."

14847.0,Patient,yeah i'm walking in the door right now get walking into my office I just gonna try to log on was coming in. Where they're. we're good to go. In my chair.
105.0,Provider,i'll wait to the devices sort of sit down and then.
14847.0,Patient,There we go yeah.
105.0,Provider,"Right, so a little. Little shaky start but you're here."
14847.0,Patient,"Yes, well."
105.0,Provider,"I had a chance to just now, a took a quick look at a goal of yours, which had to do with smoking. i'm looking at you know we're just starting, so we have a relapse prevention plan that's completely blank so I want to sort of populate that make that robust and taking a little look also at your bio psychosocial was that first assessment was one of all those questions. and So if you had a choice you know we've got sort of a limited amount of time um I don't know if my my client will show up on time. Today, on the hour, but I scheduled people always on the hour and if you had a choice sort of where to focus today would you like it to be on a building skills which we could do it could be on exploring past. substance use it could be on a little bit of the connection between your family history, the relationship with with your caregivers maybe how you interact with my girlfriend now or something else Where would you like to focus, do you think."
14847.0,Patient,"Probably. And just declared up I don't smoke, but I do use tobacco."
105.0,Provider,"or snow so sorry, let me."
14847.0,Patient,Let me go.
105.0,Provider,"Thank you for that, so we decrease nicotine and quit altogether Is your goal for my own notes, I see what I need to do here, so that I don't say smoke again you you put to you do to."
14847.0,Patient,Do yes.
105.0,Provider,"Well, why don't I write a little note about how much and how often so that we have a sort of a baseline for that."
14847.0,Patient,How much probably three cans a day. And it probably diner just.
105.0,Provider,24 724 seven and i'm just curious how many years you've been doing that.
14847.0,Patient,Since I was about 20. So 21 years.
105.0,Provider,"um do you want to talk about that, just a little bit. yeah."
14847.0,Patient,"Okay yeah Nice. Those, I would like to cut that way back."
105.0,Provider,"Okay, so what we'll do is we'll do a work in this model called motivational interview and i'm very transparent, so I say exactly what i'm doing. It doesn't I know for some people they're not interested, but what I would like to do with you right now is i'd like you to this one is. there's some numbers associated with it there's these little sort of like scales okay i'm thinking about your beer use your you call it, I want to use the right word. What do you call it."
14847.0,Patient,No.
105.0,Provider,"it's not thank you okay so um when you think about how and you don't have to answer right away, how important that keyword is important and the scale is from zero to 10 when you think about how important it is that you'd be a non snuff or. Non you know snuff users right how important it is to you today what's that first number that really seems like that said how important it is that you are a non user."
14847.0,Patient,"I already like. A five or six, but I wanted to be a one or zero."
105.0,Provider,hear you I hear you so it's important i'm gonna go 5.5 this way in. between those two if that feels right.
14847.0,Patient,"I mean. I look at it is. I. I need to for my health and. And to improve myself. But in the back of my mind, I really don't want to. Just that makes sense. I need I know I need to quit and I need, and I want to quit before for my health and my blood pressure and all that. But in the back of my mind it's kind of like I really don't want to."
105.0,Provider,"Okay. Thank you, I made note of that that's very helpful, you have. A dual mind on one hand there's good reason there's health reasons there's blood pressure. It sounds like mostly it's health reasons. Right, so now, I want you to shift gears and. I want you to think about this word ready to be doing the scale again zero to 10 minutes, today this moment. Not what you wish, it would be, but what it is, I want you to think about how confident you are, that you can do this be a non user zero to 10 how confident quick grab that number as soon as it shows up. Okay, Nice. Okay. And so let's let's go over to. um. let's play a little bit with important for a moment. So what I want you to do is I want you to think about there might be a little alarm that goes off on stealing something I walk away for a second and come right back so there might be a beat. But we're not doing a meditative practice I don't think it'll be too disruptive right now I want you to think about importance okay i'm out of 5.5 I. want you to picture that tomorrow you woke up and one thing was different try to catch the response as quickly as you can don't overanalyze it so one thing was different tomorrow and boy that important went up by a point what would be different about tomorrow. don't edit it just tell me that first thought you have."
14847.0,Patient,A good night's sleep.
105.0,Provider,"OK. Now go in and really get a feel for how. That 5.5 God established it's like okay it's important to me, but I have this ambivalence there's these two one part of my brain is sort of logic, the other one, although you didn't name it, you know it's in the back of your mind, so you have your have dual dual mind. So. How did you know. That you're definitely not a for an importance what's your answer today."
14847.0,Patient,"Just because i'm kinda on the middle of the fence. Just with the way, I think. It the snuff is a good it's a the quitting is a good idea, but it's not really something I want to do, personally, except for I know it's good for me because of my health and my high blood pressure and it would help with all those things so it's kind of that 5050 Tulsa."
105.0,Provider,"So what I heard from you is the number itself represents middle so would you say they're almost weighted the same, and so you chose a number that was right down the middle. You use the word back of. my mind and the word personally. What is it about personally that i'm assuming that's the side that does doesn't find it important to quit."
14847.0,Patient,yeah that would be probably.
105.0,Provider,"Alright, so. You started this at. What you said, I think you told me, was it 15 or something Oh, since 20 I wrote it down since age 20. At that at that time. What did it bring you. What did you using bringing."
14847.0,Patient,"Well, when I started dipping I did it, so the idea behind it was to quit smoking. I would crave a cigarette and to get my nicotine fix I would I would do and I wouldn't smoke and the next thing you know i'm not smoking, but i'm getting all the time."
105.0,Provider,"So if we go really let's go back to smoking NUTS let's go back to that what was your motivation, you know you and I weren't working together, then, but what was why quit smoking."
14847.0,Patient,"A bit because. I was working outside all the time in the winter and taking care of cattle and I was always had walking pneumonia or bronchitis, or something and. Plus my son was born and. stepping out on the porch and it's freezing cold outside of cigarette at night just. wasn't fun."
105.0,Provider,"So I think you you didn't say it, but what does that i'm not going to play stupid what's the relevance of having a sign have to do with it."
14847.0,Patient,Just because stepping outside to smoke not smoking around him or in the House and.
105.0,Provider,Not smoking around him. yeah okay. So inconvenient.
14847.0,Patient,Yes.
105.0,Provider,And also. You. I can't tell if it was inconvenient with the walking pneumonia as well.
14847.0,Patient,"No, I just tired of being sick all the time. got to where I couldn't breathe, and it was miserable."
105.0,Provider,That feeling you had when you had a. Cigarette what's the feeling that you got from it.
14847.0,Patient,"It was like it just relax me it's like. I don't know it just when you're stressed out, it does take the edge off."
105.0,Provider,"And you know that it's actually a stimulant you know that logically right. Yes, okay I got you i'm with you just checking on facts that's all. I get it. Okay okay relaxed me. So back in the 20s. What was unreal axing in your life what's going on."
14847.0,Patient,"Working seven days a week, family good new kid. But in the wife's three college all kinds of stuff."
105.0,Provider,"and Are you is that way that schedule was pretty much the same now how is it, I mean I don't you don't have a little one, but just looking at exertion how many hours are put into a day has it changed is that."
14847.0,Patient,"it's changed somewhat. i've got a a better job with benefits yet. Being manager of the department it comes with different kinds of stress and. I don't work as long hours, but then I go home and do my personal stuff so I I kind of do on the side. The weekends are are more for me like I didn't have back then."
105.0,Provider,"Okay, tell me what you enjoy on a weekend."
14847.0,Patient,"roping riding horses. Well, sometimes just. set in the House and relaxing."
105.0,Provider,sitting down.
14847.0,Patient,Just not having not having to rush somewhere go somewhere just.
105.0,Provider,"Okay, so you mentioned that what would be different tomorrow is you had a good night's sleep, can you share a little bit about. That sleep."
14847.0,Patient,"Well i've noticed and it's getting better, but one i've i've always had a hard time sleeping because of my back issues but i've noticed, since I got away from the Idaho and i'm on this medication now. I am starting to sleep better. and It just doesn't feel like i'm getting enough of it here lately it's like. us through i'd get up five o'clock every morning, no matter what now it's like it's harder and harder to get up I like I want more and more sleep."
105.0,Provider,"How long has what you just described, been going on."
14847.0,Patient,Probably a week or do.
105.0,Provider,Any other changes happen.
14847.0,Patient,No.
105.0,Provider,"So no tapering you've been at the same dose you're you're taking the same amount. Well, it does mess, with the circadian rhythm, it does mess with it. So you're going to hear probably from from the physician saying, make sure you take it at the same time for some people. They play with it and then take it at night, and it completely throws them off other people with their physiology they've managed to find a way that that works better, I don't know very different bodies process this substance differently, but. sleep is incredibly important, certainly in my my belief system, I think we've got to get a handle on that how many hours are you sleeping."
14847.0,Patient,Last night let's see I finally got up six on 10 I got eight hours last night.
105.0,Provider,"Okay, is that okay. hey."
14847.0,Patient,"yeah that's pretty good I could have probably slept nine if I had the opportunity. The corner and I. I had to make myself get up so yeah I could probably set up another hour, if I had the opportunity to do that this morning."
105.0,Provider,what's your belief about sleeping that extra hour what happens in your mind about that maybe an opinion of you.
14847.0,Patient,"I don't know I never thought about it because i've lived for so long one, you know six hours of sleep that most that i've never really thought about that."
105.0,Provider,"We have a chance to do it with me. So just think about because notice it's not a compliment it's a bit of the category of complaint today. Right not it's not welcomed it doesn't sound like and sort of explore what it means you know, maybe using that model of inquiry that i've played with. presented, which is well that that's true I long for sleep, what does that say about me just sort of keep working your way down and see if you can answer that well, I want to sleep does that say about me try and answer that."
14847.0,Patient,I don't know I don't know if it's saying i'm tired and exhausted or. If it's got a deeper meaning than that.
105.0,Provider,"So we just we do it by moving through so stay with that one. If i'm tired just go to the next one if i'm tired, what does that say about me give yourself a chance to get there. first thought, no."
14847.0,Patient,that's probably probably i'm probably doing too much.
105.0,Provider,"Okay, if that's true I said say about you."
14847.0,Patient,I need to take more meantime so what.
105.0,Provider,now hold on. If that's true. What does that say about you.
14847.0,Patient,I need more meantime.
105.0,Provider,"While you've already said that so i'll try and. we'll see if we can get there. do your best to allow that to be a real question because oftentimes we try and analyze it before we even let that question float through the air. Not doing specific parts work with you, we haven't gone into that yet, but just allow that to happen, as in if I need to take care of myself what do I believe about myself, so you can answer that I am what."
14847.0,Patient,not happy.
105.0,Provider,"Well, we were on a journey we don't know what it's going to look like until we get there, but we got to take those steps and we're taking them so notice right and if just feel bad. Maybe pick pick one of those we want to take each one by itself, which one, do you think you want to go with if it's true i'm not happy or i'm stressed."
14847.0,Patient,let's deal with the stress.
105.0,Provider,"Okay, so so ask yourself. We started with I need to take more meantime if that's true what does that say about me i'm stressed if that's so you do this one if it's true that your stress what does that say about who you are. feel it don't worry about trying to meet the mark, for me, trying to say anything or right thing, what does that say about who you believe yourself to be if i'm stressed."
14847.0,Patient,need the focus on me more.
105.0,Provider,Okay we're going to do it again you're doing fantastic hang in there for it if that's true what is the I am statement I am what.
14847.0,Patient,I am not happy.
105.0,Provider,"If that's true. What does that say, does that mean for you."
14847.0,Patient,And I need a change.
105.0,Provider,"OK, so the aim is i'm not i'm not happy. What was it like to say that out loud."
14847.0,Patient,I don't know nothing I mean. Oh. I really did feel one way or the other one I said it out loud.
105.0,Provider,"So um one way to inquire is you know with what I see is some adjustment right there's some movement some settling into it and you didn't notice anything, in particular with i'm not happy, how true is that."
14847.0,Patient,And yeah I mean there's some truth to it.
105.0,Provider,hmm. Are you a little surprised that we got here.
14847.0,Patient,No.
105.0,Provider,"Okay, all right. It might tell me more what we're gonna say I interrupted you."
14847.0,Patient,"Know uh actually I mean with I don't know with all the changes and everything and I don't know if it's. Just me trying to get off the medication, that the doctors and pat me on the last 10 years and quitting pain management, you know I don't know why but. No, I. i've noticed that. At times I haven't been happy and maybe you could call it a little depressed and I think when I start to feel that way I just buried myself in more work and more stuff to do so, I don't think about it. Or have to deal with it."
105.0,Provider,"yeah. you've been doing it this way that has a name in psychology sublimation and people work hard, they just work harder work for them before they just do it again. Your body. may be holding some information, a higher truth, if you will. it's not interested in the psychology it's got a message to you, maybe. And if, in your 20s it was messaging you I don't know, maybe you forgotten we don't know, but the body does remember. It doesn't have fancy words connected to it. But it stores it right body keeps the score there's an author that sort of rights it like that keeps keeps it. And we keep denying it pretending like it's not they're using our intellect working hard and frankly numbing. And going towards immediate pleasures the domain reward system, which is what, of course, anything that gives you for you gives you don't mean that's that part of the brand new we're talking about. I don't want to give it I don't want to give up. Young I don't want to give up. fun. You know if you say to me in general i'm exaggerating these polarities, but if you say to me i'm not that happy lady you're out of your frickin mind if you think i'm going to give up my snuff that's, the only thing that I got so pissed off right that i'm like i'm going to have no chance. So you know we're going to back way up and we're going to take a look and say. In your 20s. What did snuff do that taking a walk or riding the horse the your favorite one. Right. Just it seemed like the right answer at the time, what was it and, in fact, let me rephrase that it was smoking, frankly, but because it's about the nicotine. What how was that a better and don't worry about trying to be logical Okay, your answer is the one i'm interested in how did it solve the problem back in your 20s. First, to answer."
14847.0,Patient,"Just help take the edge off I don't know why, but it did."
105.0,Provider,Well chemically. It was effective chemically changed your chemistry. what's the edge. You were working and as a cigarette really a immediately gratifying and convenient.
14847.0,Patient,yo.
105.0,Provider,yeah is getting a horse ready and going for a ride putting your clothes on and driving to a beautiful hiking spot convenient.
14847.0,Patient,No.
105.0,Provider,"Not very. So we go with Thank you know convenient. So is refined sugar right there's a lot of things that give us the dope or mean reward immediate gratification they're not healthy for us. It does it takes this new sort of compassionate presence to say well. It depletes my production of serotonin serotonin is the happy sunshine is baseline happy I just kind of like how you doing just. Fine, happy, I mean i'm pretty like you know we're not ecstatic most humans we're not just like whoa what just want a million dollars we're not up there on ecstatic but we're like. No complaints really happy that production of serotonin is brought down when you all. Do the short term dopamine reward it brings the serotonin down there's a lot of other causes another one is what you put in your gut. 80% of your serotonin production is in your stomach smoking can't be good for that and I don't know how you eat but there's other things that can contribute to the production of serotonin and the happy. But you're messing with it with short term pleasure. You have messed with and I like to exaggerate it and I might not be exaggerating when I say you broke it it's going to take a minute to let it heal."
14847.0,Patient,i'm sure I broke it.
105.0,Provider,"All my clients house you've broken the reward system. The hedonic reward system not it's not a moral issue if you are a human that never introduced. cocaine tobacco, alcohol refined sugar you never know you wouldn't have broken it, but you did you introduce something that a sunset. Making love eating something you know sort of yummy okay that's wonderful um but then you introduce these really high doper mean. Producing items drugs are certainly what we're talking about. yeah now you bodies like this oh heck yeah screw all the rest of that stuff that's the one I want and what it does is every time you have the thought. Of stuffing smoking, whatever it is, it sprays, a little bit action says go get it okay it doesn't know that it's nicotine it just knows there was this big amount of domain present. Back in the day when we were you know just came women, it was a red berry and it was like Oh, we got to make sure that this this animal goes and gets that right Barry. Okay, this is an old old system but it's not it's not been updated with what it's using the of the APP for right, we need it to make sure we have calories we need it so that we procreate we need it we've got to have that. Oh. Great you don't want to tell them we're talking about procreation. timing. Like."
14847.0,Patient,Now i'm on the phone sorry. go away got it.
105.0,Provider,"Okay, so I want to step back, I did a little bit I don't know where it's landing what you're doing with it, so I want to check in with you a little on now, where is this land, what do you do with this information."
14847.0,Patient,"No at all that all his tongue. As far as that information. you're right on the deal, I want to have to reprogram my body."
105.0,Provider,"And it's going to be hard Jason it's not going to be convenient it's gonna be a pain in the process. Because every your your brain but that's why i'd like people to kind of think about it as brain is the tissue right it's all the the chemistry right but it's tissue. you're going to have to use your mind your body. In order to heal brain tissue you left with it, I don't know whether you're a square so I want to be respectful but if. You mess with it."
14847.0,Patient,Though.
105.0,Provider,"you're not going to be offended. No okay. cuz I gotta I punctuated sometimes because it's like I want this to hit home you done broke it. You didn't know any better, none of us did no one said you do it one time. you're going to hit the reset I wants that now that's all it's interested in and what this little stuff. So we respect that phenomena we respect the the the instinct the fact that this organism humans have continued as long as we have because of this elegant system. that's how powerful it is it ain't going anywhere but this mind up here this newer part the prefrontal cortex is a lot younger it's not as old. But we have to turn it on your teenager didn't have it fully developed. Your 10 year old didn't have it your five year old didn't have a you had to be the external prefrontal cortex you had to teach them right from wrong they still didn't know they thought they were invincible we had to teach them, you are now an adult and that part of the brain. Theoretically, is completely fully developed. Now, in some ways, we met I won't get too much into the stall development due to some other substance use, but we can use that we can use that wisdom that mindfulness that wait a second. We can remember and say Do I really want to be just acting on this brain just the tissue or am I more evolved man can I use my mind and say hold on a second. Have I really been all day long doing nothing that brought me reward is this sustainable and even that little question. might be just a slight change for you, how can this minute, how can I put something in my day in the middle of the day, to. say a prayer take a walk that it's taped call my girlfriend draw a pretty picture read upon we're going to funny video take a bath with you know I don't know what it's going to be. But that's different I mean I don't know what you're doing, but you matter your old way of push hard and deny that your body is being affected by how hard you're working it. isn't sustainable it's going to keep messaging and it's going to message even louder until you listen. let's listen to your back pain let's let's understand is try and if it's sleep it's like late lay down why the Fuck down. But now we're going to get to believe it's going to be there might be another one like this will mean I will i'm not loved I won't have things it brings up security issues, this is not a simple black and white turn the switch on this is a."
14847.0,Patient,"it's honestly, the first word, because my is scary as hell."
105.0,Provider,Oh so brave of you to say that.
14847.0,Patient,So.
105.0,Provider,"And that's what nicotine can do is, we can make the pursuit of this immediate reward we don't have to even contemplate and there's good. neuroscience out there to describe how we don't want to think about loss we just don't we don't want to postpone it, we want to think about that feel good feel good so now, so now, so now. We don't want to think about the loss and we're going to we'll get into that next time we meet okay i'm glad you shared it the big one, the big Miguel is i'm scared we all are, and what is it. And is it really the reaction of our younger self, and so we can kind of look into that and there's lots of different ways to experience some improvement around that but I do need to see you for the flower. So so let's schedule again okay. All right, all right yeah works much better when. you're here, I like I like it with you in the office that's Nice. Okay i'm looking into next week and, of course. A lot booked up, but I still have I have 7am but in hearing myself talk to you about sleep, I can offer you also an ATM on a Friday, which day is your group."
