540.0,Provider,"Alright alright, so how was the trip."
12631.0,Patient,"It was good, a little frustrating because we ended up getting delayed by like four hours. So that was fun because we got we showed up at the airport really early because our flight was super early and then like 10 minutes before boarding time they like. announced that they were like canceling our flight and like shifted everything up like four hours, so it was one of those situations where we just we were just stuck at the airport for way too long okay what."
540.0,Provider,What did you end up doing for those four hours.
12631.0,Patient,"um you know it's just like on my phone basically the entire time talk to my dad a little bit he was with me. did a little bit of walking around the mall. Like around the stores, you know, like I guess the airport kind of looks like a mall sometimes. And then. yeah and just walked around and talk to a friend on the phone for a little bit okay yeah. Try to keep myself busy but yeah it was a long a long day we you know we arrived at my destination like four hours late and then. I still had a three hour drive to here in paso Robles we're on staying."
540.0,Provider,"Okay, how long was your flight."
12631.0,Patient,"In total, it was about three or four hours, but it was a had a connection flight, so it was. At a layover. And one flight was two and a half, and then the other ones in our."
540.0,Provider,"Well, at least, you had like that breakups so that you could. So walk."
12631.0,Patient,Around yeah exactly yeah.
540.0,Provider,How does your how did you do anxiety wise.
12631.0,Patient,"pretty good um I definitely felt it. Maybe the most like almost like a residual anxiety today um. and definitely once we landed like I told like it definitely felt to just like overwhelming but I managed it pretty well by just like playing these I downloaded so many games on my phone like a little like short game, so you could play. To keep myself busy. So anxiety wise it wasn't bad I also did switch up my meds about a week ago okay. And that kind of."
540.0,Provider,match with the men.
12631.0,Patient,"So i'm now, instead of taking what is a pro lexapro taking Prozac go with olanzapine at night to as the as the anti psychotic I think it's called olanzapine. Something like that. yeah. and"
540.0,Provider,"And you to feel like it's working I mean it's still going to take some time, but do you feel like like any type of change."
12631.0,Patient,yeah I definitely feel. More. If that makes sense. Before with the lexapro I feel like it was doing a really good job of like numbing a lot of the emotions.
540.0,Provider,mm hmm.
12631.0,Patient,"Now, I find myself feeling a lot more. In in ways that."
540.0,Provider,That it's not like completely numb or.
12631.0,Patient,"You know, completely numbing. Like anxiety wise like I feel like I have knowing society now, I just have like. i'm really emotional like. Today was a little bit heavy on it. They just felt really heavy to I don't know I think I was really excited to finally be back in California today, it was like you know, the first day back and. The way I was describing it to my older brother was that is almost like ptsd because i'm like. it's almost like stepping back into the scene of the crime, because this is like where. I was when. Like I began, I had my first manic episode yeah."
540.0,Provider,"i'm the first one, but not the second one right."
12631.0,Patient,"Not the second one yeah. So I haven't this you know i'm stepping back into the space that I was in. When it all kind of started for me so. I don't know, I think it was just. It feels I forget how I described it to my brother just. I feel the loss like I felt. Like my today, like my thoughts were like bit concentrated on everything and i've kind of lost."
540.0,Provider,So kind of like hyper hyper focused on the loss.
12631.0,Patient,yeah okay.
540.0,Provider,"And it's also like you said, I mean it's your first time coming back so you're going to start processing and you may start remembering certain things certain things will spew up now that you are back home."
12631.0,Patient,And like.
540.0,Provider,"kind of coming to the scene of the initial crime, it may bring up some of those emotions and memories and feelings that you had or not even like during the the manic episode, but how your body feels towards it now."
12631.0,Patient,"No, that does make sense. It does make sense, I mean it's definitely. I mean. It definitely is just yeah my body I don't know like, even though I. I am. I don't even know how to describe like how i'm feeling honestly keep fluctuating between like being because I feel safe like I was telling my brother, I feel safe here with my family, but at the same time I don't. yeah like you said, like i'm just not liking my body is remembering everything and just feeling."
540.0,Provider,"Like like you and I have talked about it before where certain things it that it presents in our body and it stays in our body, so when we talk about. trauma it does stay in our body and it lingers. So, then we really just have to take those moments listen to our body and that's why a lot of people use meditation with traumatic episodes or traumatic experiences and. say you start thinking about that you start feeling somewhat trying to feel your body of where your anxiety is lying where. Where it feels most tense and then that's where you're going to start to try to kind of like cater what you do and your coping skills to that part of your body as well. And, but but that's how some people do use like the meditation as a tool for these sort of feelings."
12631.0,Patient,yeah I can see that I just i've never i've never been one for meditation i've tried it. But i've never really done it regularly. But maybe I should give it a try.
540.0,Provider,"it's definitely it's something that it takes time to do, especially when you do have anxiety and if your mind is racing it's somewhat that something that needs to be practiced. But they do have amazing if you just search on YouTube and you could just say event like trauma. meditation five minutes or very, very short meditation five minutes, but they do have like anxiety meditation certain ones that cater to specific mental health. So. She had her. yeah if you ever have time."
12631.0,Patient,"I definitely that's another thing definitely do have time. Now that i'm here, obviously I don't have a job, yet. that's kind of like what i'm focusing on now it's just to try to find a job, so I can at least have something to. occupy my time because because i'm basically today, I only had to run a quick errand and then, and then I was just me. You know, it just like. In my thoughts, most of the time you know. And that was the hardest. So about today."
540.0,Provider,How have your thoughts today.
12631.0,Patient,"I think i'm still grieving. Still grieving the relationship mostly within my you know I mentioned the guy from last time. That I found out that he was in a new relationship and. I think. With my dad's visit coming. Only two days after I found out, I think I used. That time with him to really as a distraction from those feelings, too, if that makes sense yeah so I found out last. Week right before we talked and then my dad came like a few days later, and then i'll go back to California yesterday, so I haven't really had the proper time to grieve. That loss."
540.0,Provider,And then process as well.
12631.0,Patient,"yeah so today, I mean today I cried twice just out of nowhere like I just felt overwhelmingly sad. And it helped definitely helped to like get it out there yeah. it's just like I was telling my brother it's just one of those things where I i've come to terms with the fact that their relationship, like me and him and I are like not meant to be. Partner second our relationship, in that sense, like i've come to terms with the fact. That we're not compatible in that way, but I. missed the friendship we had. And that's the hardest part to grieve, I think, because I don't know if we'll ever be able to be friends. and I don't know again it's it's been. Only a few months since everything kind of happens so like become jumping the gun and thinking, though, we can never taught will never talk again. I don't know."
540.0,Provider,"When I mean I, I think that right now you're trying to process the loss of your relationship, and I think that's what you need to focus on to. At first it's very hard to be friends with someone that you had those feelings for but it doesn't mean that it can never happen so usually it's just time healing growth and there has to be time in it, though."
12631.0,Patient,yeah.
540.0,Provider,"Because it's also if you tried too early to be friends, then it can spew up so say he moved on, but then you still have those feelings it's gonna it's going to be devastating, it would be for anybody."
12631.0,Patient,"I know, definitely. I know that one i'll never I I will be reaching out to him anytime. You know, like I don't know. I realized that it's going to take time I just. When I have so much free time it's hard not to like. focus on on the lunch yeah exactly. And it feels like there's a reminder everywhere, I look. You know, like a reminder."
540.0,Provider,The white usually reminds you of time.
12631.0,Patient,"it's hard to say it's I can't even pinpoint that because, like honestly like. He for for basically an entire year. him and I would talk every day. So. me just going about my day. reminds me of him because. He and I would always. Be texting and talking about random things and just. You know it's not make sense it's it does like it's not so much like. I see it."
540.0,Provider,"Every day normal see of I mean talk to him and just I mean everything I thought point is going to be connected to him, because just every day that that part is missing."
12631.0,Patient,"Exactly and it's that's the hardest part and it's just. yeah that's the hardest part is like I lost something that. i'm missing that i'm missing missing that connection, that I had with him because there's No one. You know there's no one, I talked to that frequently with this. You know. I was so vulnerable with them, you know, like the most vulnerable i've ever been with anyone so it's just. it's just hard to like. You know, to yeah it's realizing that that the fact that I shared so much of myself with him. That. You know I yeah. The biggest I think the biggest."
540.0,Provider,"One is that hurts. And I think it's going to her a little bit more right now, too, because you've had so much instability, where you've been kind of going at it and trying to just really survive mental health wise and. That was at least stability each day of being able to talk to him and being able to have that as like a solid ground."
12631.0,Patient,"Only. Liam. is always he always knew. You know, whenever I yeah I wasn't even there was like sharing with him, like all my problems, it was just more like just talking to him brighten my day so like allowed me to like have something to look forward to in the night day. Even if it was something as simple as just sharing a random name or something you know and and. yeah."
540.0,Provider,"And that and then maybe something that you still need to get by it's so with this loss, maybe, showing that this is a need that you have and it's not filling his shoes, but filling that role. And maybe, maybe, making sure that you call your brother, maybe try to do like a morning phone call or whatever time works, good for both of you guys and try to make something like that, like very religiously so. And that friend that you call that they're poor maybe try to talk to two people that are pretty consistent. So that. If one day one of them can't talk, then the other may and you at least have that that stability to fall back on."
12631.0,Patient,"that's a good idea that's definitely. that's definitely a good idea, just because it's. yeah I don't want to isolate myself, which is what I usually do whenever whenever i'm going to low that's what i've done the past just isolate myself so when i'm feeling like this reaching out is really, really hard you know. And I know."
540.0,Provider,"Right now, you may have to force yourself, so you may have to force yourself to dial your brother's number."
12631.0,Patient,and
540.0,Provider,"And even I mean even tell your friend and your brother say hey like it's gonna be really hard for me to reach out I could you guys just even if it's a meme in the morning, or if it's something that just can get you through that moment. And little things that make them think of you, and vice versa, so whether it's a small mean that you see that reminds you of your brother just send it randomly throughout the day."
12631.0,Patient,yeah.
540.0,Provider,"But it's definitely going to be a little bit trickier right now, because you are back home. And just working through these moments."
12631.0,Patient,"yeah just been. i'm just I mean i've been letting the feelings flow. today. Like moments, where I just basically had to lay in bed not doing anything because it felt really heavy. Like I said, like laying myself just cry cry it out, and I know it's going to take a while, which is. I do need to find. Like you said ways to like. replace the things that I feel are missing."
540.0,Provider,"But you also, I mean you may need that night where you're able to grief and that's where you get all the pictures out and you go through all the memories and you get a sense of closure. So you may need one of those nights that yeah maybe cry cry fest but you may need that. and listening to your songs and replaying different moments in your head to allow you to be able to start moving on. And not moving on to another relationship, but just. Being able to move forward."
12631.0,Patient,Do you.
540.0,Provider,"Take from the relationship take from that experience take from your friendship and the more and more that you can move forward, maybe, hopefully, you guys will be able to have that friendship later on."
12631.0,Patient,yeah. yeah it's just.
540.0,Provider,it's okay to have these moments.
12631.0,Patient,"Definitely. yeah I just. yeah I just need to allow myself tab but night. it's been i've been doing a little bit of purging as far as photos and stuff like slowly messages specially deleted I finally went to delete it, the message thread that we had."
540.0,Provider,Here then.
12631.0,Patient,I felt like I needed to. It was something that I kept going back to and looking at and feeling that. yeah so I just had to go in and delete it. yeah.
540.0,Provider,"And that's why I think that sometimes just catering like one night to be able to go down that rabbit hole to go down and just cry and feel it. But then go so even like making a special night, even if you put candles around and just you made it your night that you have this closure. And then move forward so force yourself to delete these photos force yourself to really get rid of the things that are going to keep on holding you back even though you're still going to grieve but."
12631.0,Patient,To.
540.0,Provider,"be able to start focusing on you, but you've had a loss."
12631.0,Patient,i'll have to do that by some ice cream or something.
540.0,Provider,buy some ice cream.
12631.0,Patient,"yeah definitely. And that's where that's where my mind has been today I just. Luckily, I was still able to get up and go about my day. In between the moments. Get get a couple errands done so that felt good to be able to be productive in a sense. While also feeling like. Not wanting to do anything you know yeah."
540.0,Provider,"Well, especially after that long day of travel. And yeah traveling is it's fun and all but it's. it's a lot of work to."
12631.0,Patient,Do. Definitely.
540.0,Provider,So your body and your mind's going to be recuperating for the next few days.
12631.0,Patient,"yeah The good news is that I got my. appointment with my doctor coming up, and they should be scheduling my the therapists were here in the area soon so i'll be. I got a call today from them letting me know that the dates for my doctor's appointments and stuff like that so i'll be getting all that figured out here soon awesome."
540.0,Provider,"All right, yeah so just always keep me in the loop so, then we can transfer and Trent do whatever we need for the transition okay."
12631.0,Patient,"yeah for sure, I still don't know dates for their therapy I think they're still trying to figure out who, when. But. The most of them like I think I don't even know if the doctors, like a primary care, I think he is not entirely sure. Or if he's like a psychiatrist I didn't get confirmation on that, but."
540.0,Provider,But they'll continue medication that you've been doing with us right.
