207.0,Provider,"There is a way to say. It is a way to say i'm sorry, but then, at the same time, to come to that place to say i'm sorry for the things that i've done i'm sorry for the hurt that cause. i'm sorry for all the things that I have done too long view. I can say i'm sorry for that, but then it's also coming to that place and saying. This is not for us. This is not for me."
10027.0,Patient,to wrap my head around.
207.0,Provider,"But, but this is the key thing of what you just said, Patrick. Gil will keep giving you a reason to stay."
10027.0,Patient,abreast what was the only answer I keep coming up with the only one i'm good i'm good you know everything that came with a drought Atlanta years whatever but. I guess that's what kept me going back to the relative to begin with all the other drugs and everything else that's what I feel guilty i'm nuts are cowardly out I gotta run the something.
207.0,Provider,"It. If i'm still in group, this week, you know you are in in this one, we talked about commitment. and commitment in what is our issue with commitment, whether it's relationship, but sometimes we have a false sense of commitment we have sometimes we commit to the things that we have no business committing to. Because of guilt. Sometimes we have this false sense of loyalty to the things that we don't need to be loyal to. It kind of like i'm Patrick we've been friends, since we were three like I don't understand. How you just go impending you like that, like I don't understand how you go and get into plan of how you gonna let this get in between them. So then, there is this sense of loyalty to along the lines of friendship right of knowing each other we've done it together like i've had your back we've had our back. But then the truth of the matter is is coming to that place and say yes we've had each other's back, but let's look at how we have each other's back. let's look at the things that we've done. Our commitment to each other has been awful toxic we've done things to hurt each other, simply because of a false sense of loyalty, a commitment to each other that needed to end a long time ago. So now something bad happens to me. And now. You feel Oh well, I was the one that when you drive in a car, and this is the reason why it happened to you, so now that guilt to remain connected. But let's look at it. Why were you in the. car accident or what will we doing. On time we avoid looking at the details. of that commitment, and that lawyer. That sense of loyalty because guilt clouds us from reviewing and looking at the details of all of."
10027.0,Patient,Our. I thought Boston security. or stolen to carolyn Jeff but the rug has been pulled off Missouri. stand on.
207.0,Provider,"A kind of the reason why we can't get to the light of the at the end of the tunnel. The sometimes when we look at. The relationship that we're in and we just can't make it and why all these bad things are happening it's because because of the fact that we're together now you have to know your situation and i'm not by any means encouraging you to go walk out or whatever, but you it's what I. pretty much saying is, you have to look at the detail the detail is in the problem, the problem, whatever the problem is it's all in the detail, to understand the problem you have to look at the details. you've ever seen look at it like this. we're in a relationship right and for the last 10 years we've been trying really hard. to conceive. We went and we got checked on a net robot you ain't nothing wrong with me but we're having a hard time listen to. But then I decided to step out in Chicago."
10027.0,Patient,And I haven't been listening what to say right now that's that's a lot of what you have right now that will move the nail on the head with that one because that's that's a lot what i'm going through right now. And now we don't have a locker guess what now you got. Outsiders looking in and now now that's a problem to the mitigating circumstances are going to get that's probably need to actually ask the question because I wouldn't even ask me for. well.

207.0,Provider,"mm hmm. it's there. But this is the truth, though, Patrick he, why did you, you have to ask us to answer this question what was it that was so enticing for you were you just a man, being a man that just saw a chicken thought oh wow or What was it for you what made you decide to look out and set up."
10027.0,Patient,The River one. Of the phone with everyone. or wasn't with one another with everything under one opportunity and I thought that was fabulous I know. That I overlooked. or an opportunity.
207.0,Provider,"sheet because i'm going to i'm going to expect in the place and just for a second because Maybe she is looking at it, that there's no excuse."
10027.0,Patient,"Probably, but we also met with or an opportunity to have. Also, the breathing."
207.0,Provider,And so Where are you now truthfully Where are you now.
10027.0,Patient,i'm had nothing to. kind of figure it out on the road that's what i've learned is this particular during the next best room and I just don't know what the next best thing would be.
207.0,Provider,"Maybe not focusing so much on the next best thing and being honest with yourself, because at the end of the day, yes, the other person may be both of you may be devastated about the outcome but, at the end of the day. The truth in. All of it is. Did you step out because it was just merely an opportunity, and it was just a a good night out or was it is it that."
10027.0,Patient,"I really should be just one. Foot out the door republican. brother my attention just remind customers, you can be exactly what I did I mean I wouldn't like it we're just a random venue where i've i've made it happen, I wouldn't be sitting around waiting for it to happen, I got up and I did it because. i'm sick of looking in here and I didn't. know before rebuttal for what i'm giving i'm giving you a an answer to your questions right. Now I will say Lucy maybe maybe we've got enough for them and mikey about a lot of things right or something I sought out when I did it, how do. I reach. them everybody's important on my coat per phone whoa whoa whoa whoa come this way i'm gonna play when I was finding you know what i'm gonna go see."
207.0,Provider,"is always going to be there and it could be based on how your thing it could just be temptation, but we, this is my question to you is the one that you're with. Do you love this individual and can see yourself. going to mcdonald's and drinking sipping one SIP of coffee because that's the best that's that next level kind of relationship. You know the oakland mcdonald's Is that how you see this individual."
10027.0,Patient,i'm drunk once with a coffee.
207.0,Provider,"You don't even open the McDonalds his dream, they buy one in faith shifting the one the coffee."
10027.0,Patient,i'm a rah rah rah rah rah rah rah the lemon over the front porch Robinson was cool.
207.0,Provider,Is that still the idea because relationship come with it it's the bumps in the road like you said.
10027.0,Patient,I probably don't remember Tom. bone phone or an iPhone or.
207.0,Provider,"Your Okay, but then you're feeling. you're unsure if this person wants you in do the same thing, the same in the same manner in which you do."
10027.0,Patient,All of our customers want them up and running.
207.0,Provider,"And that's how you feel and that's what made you go out there and he also the temptation, well then, my dear sounds like you both need couples counseling because you both need couples counseling. Because this is the thing. This is the reason why I say to both in couples counseling. Because if you're saying you're feeling the way you feel. Yes, it is going to frustration is going to set in and then i'm going to answer to the temptation. it's in the same way, the shoe is, on the other foot in the same way she is going to it think about a woman who feels like she's not getting the attention from her mate in the home. Listen out here on. He can come tell me i'm cute and guess what I am going to think he is the finest thing on god's green Earth. Simply because you are not giving me the attention I desire, so I succumb to the one that gave it to me. And if this is the situation where the communication is."
10027.0,Patient,We are offering bottled up.
207.0,Provider,"Then, this is where before you make that final you both need to go to couples counseling there is not enough saris in the world that can make way for a physical child, because every time I look at this child is. going to be wrong reminder of. something that happened. The hurt in the truth of the matter is we both go out there and do our dirty it's just that I have evidence of my dirty. And I will always have for the rest of my life evidence of my dirty. and Both of you have to come to that place to say, can this relation to survive the birth of a child."
10027.0,Patient,"This method part of the reading and writing what. Are your favorite food, have you tried to regenerate what to build for somebody right. metal. With nothing, and we will go or not, the phone if I don't worry about it i'll call mark and I both."
207.0,Provider,"well known tomorrow, not another day because marco's that because i'm bringing my thing happens from today and for tomorrow, until every day until eventually we both say enough is enough, and then. This is where we were we're now just coexisting were just roommates and that's not what so. You This is where you have to cut a couple of counseling is is what is needed. couples counseling to say is this something that needs to continue, because you both also don't want to. Because you say you both have your own histories of addiction right you both have your own individual paths. You don't want to content, because if you're both working very hard to maintain this recovery road and to stay on the journey if you're both working very hard. And like you said learning how to get over another bump in the road or get through or get around this other bumps in the road, if this is what you're both doing stay in a relationship like what it is you're going to find some way to cope and deal with the hurt. The disappointment."
10027.0,Patient,Regarding the moment.
207.0,Provider,"No, no i'm not talking about right now the longer I said. If you and I aren't listening, this is the thing women and men, we both have emotions, but we both deal with it very differently. The longer I stay in a relationship and every time I look at you, Patrick. And I think about you, being in the arms of another woman, I am going to create what that looks like i'm going to create in my mind what was said, I am going to create i'm going to create all kinds of images in my head. rubble and if you and i'm going to blame myself and i'm going to do this and i'm going i'm going, this is what i'm going to do. And so, even though you're saying you're sorry, and I take it, for the moment, but every time. I am going to. Really. release it gets so overwhelming that I need to stop it, I either stop it by going out and doing something specific. or I stopped it by going out and and if I go out if I step out on the relationship, if I haven't and I do it just to get you back because sometimes we get a little petty. And we step out and we do the same thing, because I want you to feel the hurt the truth of the matter is, you will never feel the hurt and the same way i'm feeling to her. Because how a man responds to infidelity is very different from how a woman, a man it's harder I would think or I would say in working with individuals. it's harder for a man to bounce back from infidelity a woman, a woman is more likely to say let's work through this because hey my heart belongs to you. amanda said, your your your your heart belongs to me and my heart belongs to you, but just the idea of another man being in that picture, or just stepping out it's harder to bounce back from."
10027.0,Patient,Not.
207.0,Provider,"To try, can you see."
10027.0,Patient,Rebecca wouldn't live without my whole before you said anything. You can sort of build a house with that one that may have just gotten.
207.0,Provider,"There you go, so you it's it's I think you I think before either one of you make a rash decision I think most of you need to come to that place of. Getting counseling and putting it out on the table, the health of our the future of our relationship depends on fish. it's not. an excuse or it's not acceptable and it's not me justifying my wrong, and neither either one of you, but at the same time, the hurt is still there, the disappointment is still there. And each of you look at infidelity in very different way, the way you deal with it. You saying hey i'm bringing a child into our relationship is going to be harder for you to Father the child, I am bringing into every time you look at me. As the growth, the bump grows, it is more you're disgusted with the idea so you're gone the minute I say I conceive and I don't belong to you you're gone. Well, for me, hmm."
10027.0,Patient,My worry would be wouldn't be who will be looking at one whatever whatever the. problem.
207.0,Provider,"Is it's I think it's it's. Instead of continuing to co exist and wondering if this is going to work I think most of you need to go to couples therapy and put it all on the table and say hey where do we go from here. And not lie to each other, where do we go from here if you're willing to work it out, you have to find out if she's willing and she's not willing, and she just said, this is just if I could do with you going to jail, I could do with all of the things that but I can't do this. Or, this is that you know what this was the last."
10027.0,Patient,row.
207.0,Provider,"But then both of you have to come in, you have to put it out on the table and say hey. hello, can you hear me. Well yeah I have to jump in. I have to jump into another session so let's schedule a follow up."
10027.0,Patient,"I want to look so Dr bravo he only got my meds for two weeks so now I got to be in group next week and asked him for him to refill again I guess. Because I when I talked to my heart, they said that he didn't you didn't have it on a schedule and I. Remember, last week, he didn't he wasn't there."
207.0,Provider,"Okay, we are do back to yeah so you're do back to group next on the first."
10027.0,Patient,know first.

207.0,Provider,"Okay Okay, let me see."
10027.0,Patient,"They they loved one I made sure I was in compliance with everything did everything I need to do, and they said that you know he just. might have made a mistake or whatever, and I call back and I talked to somebody and they haven't gotten a response phone I figured i'd like to talk to you today and we got five you can you hit me up top my head with a hammer, that immediately."
207.0,Provider,"and See. Okay, so yeah, so this is what I would recommend just go ahead and come to group and just let him know, but he gives you the retail. Well you're welcome come to group every two weeks anyway. So when you come to group. When you come to group just remind him so he could do it for the month is better for the two weeks."
10027.0,Patient,Pro So when I come with the following Monday we tell them I need a written for.
207.0,Provider,The month the month yeah because everything on your chart is fun. yeah everything yesterday because you just even did your drug screen and they just sent you out another one on the. show it mailed out another cup on the 12th but it shows that you just did a drug screen on Saturday.
