12432.0,Patient,yeah. I could see him once a month. But he requires to me every three months.
383.0,Provider,"Okay, I think you need to see how a little bit more often if you're feeling terrible in the morning, the way you describe, and if your blood pressure's if your blood sugar is not. Not under you know it's not being managed very well. Are you able to take care of activities of daily living meaning like laundry showering."

12432.0,Patient,"I don't know like it's almost like every couple of days now. So, ever since I moved into this your place was. Just drastic change, I went from. living in like a master. bedroom of. pick a really big house. And it's like looking over the ocean and stuff and amazing bathroom amazing everything. Then we move into smaller places just I gotta get used to. Just. Being a lot smaller. again."

383.0,Provider,"yeah, but this is kind of showing to me that your symptoms of depression are arm a little bit you know they're a little worse if you're not feeling motivated to do things around the House you don't really see the point and you don't feel you know you don't feel any enthusiasm. And you're kind of slipping with your self care, it seems like the depression is it's not it's not, I think you need to play with shontelle because all you're taking is gabba penton if you're going off the abilify. I think you need to have an evaluation, for your medications because there's maybe, something that we can do to help with you know your moon, as it seems pretty slow."

12432.0,Patient,i'm fine. Things to work on the House and. Work on the yard. yeah I haven't been interested in writing or drawing or anything that i've been really into.
383.0,Provider,"So. Do you think you can make an appointment with chantel to kind of have a review of your medicine, because i'm. i'm kind of at a loss, I don't know how we, you know. How you how do you feel that I can help you."
12432.0,Patient,"i'm. Just like. I remember a lot of things. just focus on them individually really detailed, so I don't really like. Talking about. Too much stuff. I just gone to like these halls. of information and. Not. And not really into being reminded constantly like. For my problems are and how about I. just want to get better."
383.0,Provider,Okay well um. Do you feel like you don't want to be a part of a program like my heart out.
12432.0,Patient,I just don't know what. I don't know how to progress. Talking about. I don't know the same things just a lot really. it's just the same thing every day before six in the morning.
383.0,Provider,"Okay, so. yeah, so why don't you think about what you want, you think you how you think Brian our health can help you if you want to participate. I am going to ask you to call the virtual clinic back to schedule our next appointment because. I don't have time to schedule that now and i'm not sure that you're in a space to really want to you know. Because it has to be a team effort it can't just be me like kind of reminding you do this do that the other, you know if you don't if it's not something that we're kind of working on together. it's not going to be very effective, because then you're going to feel like sort of you know badgered into doing this or that or the other thing. So I think you want to think about what your. What if you want to work, you know, work together, or if you feel like you just need a break from mental health or maybe you need to see shontelle about your medicine, I don't I don't know but. I don't want to be in making causing you to feel like i'm you know pushing anything on you in terms of like what to do, or how to do anything. But I if I you know I think our appointment should not be on a Friday, because you know by Friday you're just kind of winding down and. I think they need to be if we have appointments going to be the beginning of the week we've got to like get some goals set up and a commitment to follow through with the goals. and But if that's not you know, like I said i'm just. think that you want to think about what you want, out of your met your your appointments. And if you want to be in you know involved and, if not that's that's totally fine too, but I think you're in a depression that's the way that I would. And you've got some health issues that are kind of it's all sort of dovetailing together."
12432.0,Patient,yeah. going to be interesting so. again.
383.0,Provider,"Good stuff Okay, so why don't you call virtual clinic because I have someone in the waiting room for them, then their payment call the virtual clinic to schedule, please schedule on a Monday or Tuesday, if you want to reschedule an individual appointment. and and yeah think about what you want to do, maybe a little bit before you make that appointment, so you can tell me what your what your goals are OK. OK OK. or make an appointment. With a few chantelle to have your medications looked at. Okay."
12432.0,Patient,"Okay, thank you."
383.0,Provider,Okay you're welcome to get. into.
