And I got into that work they actually just offered me a job. So. it's my life's work um. um. And then I have, as I mentioned this legal case. Because I went to a monastery a land of medicine Buddha in so California last like two years ago, almost now and, as I said, I was working there and was still kind of integrating out of. Everything that i'd been through in the past few years, getting some. Awareness on that and had come to discover the there was. Quite a that there was I teacher, I leader at the monastery that I had joined, who had molested several students nuns. And I was kind of like a technical director there that was like my day job you know, and I actually still have the laptop with the evidence on it. Which is actually why I have a court case that you may have to speak to my court liaison with bright heart about because I have this has to be right, you know document and whatnot to them, nobody ever followed up on the you know, on all of that, and I wound up having to. God help me I wound up having to make a statement recorded statement after David and everything within an organization called faith trust Institute. Which is tired by religious organizations police departments schools things like that, after there have been sexual misconduct, and so, so the case that i'm dealing with which is not, I mean it's kind of a combination of things that have brought me to you guys, you know."
148.0,Provider,yeah.
15420.0,Patient,"Right um. But i'm grateful for the court case in a sense, to make it a pressing thing because I can't continue to keep killing myself and. i'm I have been sitting with the reality that the current medical conditions here in that I am dealing with that could leave me paralyzed in my sleep frankly know what i'm dealing with. mm hmm I know what i'm dealing with I know what i've done to myself, is what i've done to myself, you know, and I have a little boy I have a beautiful, you know wife and I don't want to like this is her. she's way too hot for me. way the Fuck too hot for me to look at that right."

But you know what i'm talking about I i've tried the BT i'm assuming you're well versed in some of this, which is why i'm just kind of throwing it out there, and thank you. i've tried dpt a little bit schema modeling seems to work, however, to be honest, anything that makes me hyper aware of. How do I put it hyper aware of. Identity models within myself kind of only exacerbates the problem does that make sense. it's like oh i'm splitting into the. dragon to to to to to attach it. Right right oh i'm splitting into the kid did you know what I mean, and thank you for understanding, you know the language have to us with that. Or is that just that just messes with your head more yeah and I spend a lot of time alone is trailer you know, in the middle of nowhere with my guitar and you know a lot of farmland in mountain land out there to to. deal with by myself, my wife isn't Connecticut right now so. i'm. yeah i'm really.

15420.0,Patient,"The short of it is stabbed myself through the drug dealer on my birthday August 23 of this year. um because you know my wife was in like we've been dealing with should she was basically raped by like her last two axes the past. couple of months i've been using my super hacker skill. To take it out on them in ways that don't violate the law, but are pretty fucked up like I bought their names.com. You know, and then me to them, and she was okay with it initially she is like actually was kind of her idea. But then she's like you know you're an evil piece of shit yada yada yada. And I realized you call it can't like to that to people, but you know, one of them was in the air force and he filmed it and, like wouldn't delete the videotapes so I have a lot of trauma over that if you can imagine that and. yeah i've been in contact with the US Air Force and she doesn't know this i've been a contact with us fucking air force and Congressman. issue, an issue trying to get him discharge i'm not making this shit up yeah like I went like full on super hacker on this guy he's a piece of shit he writes my wife dude and filmed it and then she asked him to delete the videotapes and he wouldn't and. they're in this like weird human design Cole which is basically a cold of schizophrenia X effectively like human design like seriously. crazy should have ever dealt with in my life, and he mind controlled or manipulated or drugged her and took drugs himself, while he was enlisted, and still is. coerced or into making a tape she didn't want to make she sent my twice both times she's like I don't want to do this and then afterwards told him to delete it and he he wouldn't delete it until she had to threaten them with me so. what's the hacker supposed to do you know after we have a miscarriage right and he's like. posting shit about her online On top of that, and she has like Stockholm syndrome over the guy like don't be mad at him and my ex is be mad at me no you don't you know what I mean that Stockholm syndrome. So there's that on the side that. I may or may not have to deal with. yeah I don't know i'm just kind of set fire on that, like since I realized, since I got the X rays back, and I saw and I realized holy shut the the. i've been having numb outs, like my whole body was known as the Fuck out, you know or as i'm going to sleep, or if i'm really, really tired or I haven't hydrated enough i'm getting the signs of the nervous system damage. Right, I know what i've done to myself now. And so i've kind of gotten to that place where it's like well. last season, possibly, you know I I wanted this but I didn't want it like this i'm going to go out the best way that I can but also part of me is like guys, like her X i'm also going to be Karma to. The the monk at our monastery I helped turn him in I live out in the mountains next to like meth labs and stuff I fought a Nazi last year in the streets. Of the city, who was running a meth lab This is like boulder creek it's a mountain town, you know, like loggers and Dudes run around literally chased after you down the street with a chainsaw normal people because there's a lot of mess up here I don't touch that stuff i'm a hippie right. Okay, and."
148.0,Provider,I was gonna ask you do you have any history with substances are abusing substances.
15420.0,Patient,"Right, so my brother or my my dad committed up guns or my dad died in prison 2011 ish or whatever for raping an 11 year old girl there is X hells angel blah blah blah my brother committed suicide on heroin three months later, and I have only tried tylenol three with coding. hey."
148.0,Provider,hi.
15420.0,Patient,hey i'm wow the timing is awesome pg&e just killed the power up on our mountain.
148.0,Provider,Oh no okay.
15420.0,Patient,"bye in progress it's happening, they do that up here yeah the euro, going to be hearing cars flying by because we live off grid, we have yeah so anyway um I still have connection thankfully um you're asking about substance issues so psychedelics started in. I had a cardiac arrest at work, basically, not because of psychedelics but because of stress work life, alcoholism alcoholism, that was a big one, to help 1999 ish through 2015 2016 i'm otherwise that never smoked a cigarette and. um and then and 2015 2016 began working with psychedelic therapy and stopped alcoholism. My first child. coming into the picture I had a I guess you call that that that transitional period for about two years where I mixed and just kind of figuring things out, but never did any like hard drugs no like you know injection stuff unless it was literally done by a nurse, you know. And i've actually done. ketamine was also similar condition that's only been twice in my life, and that was in Austin. By it was also another one of those like you know this is like under the radar stuff right, and this is recorded, but whatever uh let me not name the name of the clinic, but it was a nurse, who worked at a clinic. After I had a very severe suicide attempt. And she offered it to me, and it was also again very, very, very, very, very, very, very successful, but things like that you know once I have a lot of reverence for them, because they. know that it's really powerful, so I don't play with them, those are not recreational drugs for me I don't touch that stuff I micro dose mushrooms. Micro dose LSD for pain um and. I will ask Oh, we grow and that's like a religious thing literally I work with a shaman who lives on the mountain with me, who was born in Peru in the jungle. mm hmm so I mean like I said i've gotten offered a job, by maps, like, I am a chemist like I can, if I have to defend that the body or anything you know I can go downstairs and show you my lab if that's necessary but we don't need to do that, you know."
148.0,Provider,And I also was curious when your last suicide attempt was.
15420.0,Patient,August 23.
148.0,Provider,And are you currently having any suicidal ideation.
15420.0,Patient,"I think about suicide every day I own suicide of self love calm. I work with deaf doulas. So I believe in euthanasia. Suicide for like I hate myself I hate the world that kind of stuff, no, no, not in that sense, not in like that impulsive suicidality, no, no. see that you understand what i'm saying right."
148.0,Provider,"Right, so you want to be alive."
15420.0,Patient,"Yes, yeah not in pain. Live not in pain, they can love to my wife hanging out with my beautiful baby I got their pictures like next to the phone fyi so you know it's that sort of thing right um yeah i've got a great blessed life I have a very, very fucking awesome life i'd be a fool to not really but um. The physical I know a lot of it is somatic it's really hard to work through your trauma when you're always feeling that pain, you know that caused it. So that's something i'm very hopeful about with bright heart actually because when I saw that you guys offer that it's like Okay, this might actually work because they might actually listen to the medical side of stuff too, and not just try to throw. You know, whatever. Out of an or something at me, you know, I was a clinical care taker with the state of California, you know FDA clearance thumbprint the whole nine yards, you know what i'm talking about right, so I know this is my industry right and so it's humbling to. Know yeah."
