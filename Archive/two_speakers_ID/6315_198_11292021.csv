6315.0,Patient,hey. How are you.
198.0,Provider,"i'm good I gotta. I got a Facebook message from your sister and I responded back to her that I can't discuss anything with family members, unless you have a. That you've signed a release of information for me to discuss your medical stuff. So. i'm not sure if you knew that she reached out or whatever, but."
6315.0,Patient,didn't know yes.
198.0,Provider,"Okay, but if you want to, if you want me to discuss stuff with your family members that's fine you just have to sign up, particularly with. addiction management that the regulations are very clear, for your patient protection that you just need to obviously if you're there, giving verbal consent, you know, like in this particular case i'm assuming is fine. For somebody to be present, then that's one thing, but. But you have to be you have to either give verbal consent on the computer that it's Okay, for them to be there, or you either have to give written consent before i'm allowed to discuss anything."
6315.0,Patient,About for a second.
198.0,Provider,"Well it's up to Sarah that's what I mean it's it's her it's there the the regulations around particularly. addiction are really strict you know, to protect the."
6315.0,Patient,Almost about. To come back in.
198.0,Provider,um but if Sarah wants me to come back in if.
6315.0,Patient,"I want you to say, I want to make. needs to stay in here. Like I mean I mean like. Like i'm just being thrown under the bus because i'm on something that I don't know how to get off of."
198.0,Provider,"Okay. So just before you, before we start just give verbal consent to who this is and that you that you consent for them to be part of your medical visit."
6315.0,Patient,"So, Patrick Watson a husband and I get I get into."
198.0,Provider,"All right, all right. Okay, so why don't you tell me what's going on."
6315.0,Patient,"Just release it like as a kid you know, Patrick thinks i'm abusing everything and I don't even think that's possible because i've been doing it every four days and just literally like this morning I was outside of wait till they opened at nine and I don't even know how to work. It was. amazed. 25 times I went to the bathroom 100 I mean it's."
198.0,Provider,"Okay, so let's back up so when I talked to you last time you had been taken two milligrams a day and your withdrawal symptoms were gone, and so we continue to milligrams a day."
6315.0,Patient,Correct.
198.0,Provider,Even taking just two milligrams every day and your withdrawal symptoms came back.
6315.0,Patient,Absolutely.
198.0,Provider,"Okay, so."
6315.0,Patient,I don't know what day it was like when I started feeling like it was regulating when I went from four to two. Or to add thought I started feeling I really did like I started feeling better.
198.0,Provider,mm hmm and you're taking two milligrams and then I know that that was. Either the Wednesday or Thursday.
6315.0,Patient,The week before.
198.0,Provider,"uh huh right because we discussed, I think it was maybe Tuesday or Wednesday, you had said you'd been regulated for a couple of days, and that you might want to just take your last pill, which was going to be on a Thursday, it was going to be on a Thursday before thanksgiving."
6315.0,Patient,"yeah right, and they were going to."
198.0,Provider,"And I was. A week. yeah before thanksgiving Okay, and then you call back the next day and said you didn't want to do that anymore. And you want to just stay on two milligrams for you, because you were feeling good so i've just had you stay on two milligrams since then and you've been taking just one two milligrams a day since then, but starting to feel worse."
6315.0,Patient,I feel awful. awful awful.
198.0,Provider,"Okay, so how long were you feeling normal."
6315.0,Patient,"Patrick I say I have not thought normal at all, but I mean I thought it was. I thought I was. I literally thought that it had gone the going to Florida to. You know, in those two weeks that I was Okay, it was regulated."
198.0,Provider,mm hmm.
6315.0,Patient,"I mean. I think my biggest thing is all week Oh, I was just in. Hilton head with everybody. mm hmm and. I mean, I was, I felt like I was in bed more than not then not like nobody questioned anything don't get."
198.0,Provider,What do you mean nobody questioned anything.
6315.0,Patient,"In Scott at all they've told me as how great it was great. Question it to me Oh, they didn't question it to me. Can you tell her how much or how little don't even taking so yeah so Patrick thinks that this the veil is. are actually I guess Scott. Thanks the vapors the problem, not the problem. But initially what."
198.0,Provider,What. marijuana is that what they're talking about or tobacco marijuana.
6315.0,Patient,"yeah we're talking about just the like the CBD that is it's like less than 3%. What i've been on forever, I mean it shows up every single time you take a drug test. How much do you know about Dante."
198.0,Provider,"Not I mean, certainly not a ton I don't prescribe it I know some of my patients to take it and but I haven't experienced enough to really be able to character as for you, if there's a with you know, a clear withdrawal symptom syndrome, with it, or any of that kind of thing and. Certainly, I know that typical marijuana withdrawal can lead to diarrhea and you know all those other sorts of things irritability things like that."
6315.0,Patient,i've taken it. for recreational purposes and i've taken it to sleep yeah also smoked marijuana plenty in the past and that the effects are. The. same there are so identical you couldn't tell if you smoked marijuana or view eight or smoked delta eight there there's no. discernible differences at all.
198.0,Provider,mm hmm.
6315.0,Patient,And i'm wondering if would the level of her usage of this would that affect the drugs that she's trying to be weaned off on.
198.0,Provider,"Patrick honestly i'd have to look into that I can certainly do a literature review or potentially talk to our chief medical officer, because I don't have a whole lot of experience in that where somebody would admit that they were taking so much of it or. That they were worried that they were. Having increased or decreased effects from that like I said. In general, when I see people that have been on big doses of thc let's say, and I say a big dose it's like 30 or 40 milligrams a day, you know that kind of thing. And then they stopped abruptly you definitely can get a lot of withdrawal significant diarrhea you know this kind of thing but it sounds like. you're talking about just continuously without withdrawal."
6315.0,Patient,yeah I mean.
198.0,Provider,Not that to that level.
6315.0,Patient,Stop.
198.0,Provider,"No, and you and you haven't taken like two or three pills to feel better and then not had pills for. During that four day period you just been taking the one pill a day."
6315.0,Patient,"Yes, so Tuesday I think. We left Wednesday morning so Tuesday. They gave me for."
198.0,Provider,yeah and you were feeling fine at that point. Like for me.
6315.0,Patient,Now i'm trying to figure out when you went from feeling fun to not fun. When did I talked to you last.
198.0,Provider,"The day after we saw each other, which was. I think so each other on Tuesday before thanksgiving we made a plan that you're going to take your last phone Thursday I think you called on Wednesday and said you didn't want to do that. And I went ahead and called in the medicine on Wednesday, so that because I thought the pharmacy might be closed on Thursday on on the. On something i'm not sure the dates of that honestly I think it's it was somewhere The week before thanksgiving right because I knew that I tried to Tom your dosage so you wouldn't need a refill on thanksgiving day I remember that."
6315.0,Patient,For until I saw yours is it.
198.0,Provider,A week or the week before thanksgiving you were doing okay.
6315.0,Patient,I haven't been okay and. How long.
198.0,Provider,Will the last the last I talked to you said you felt like it stabilized out you felt better than you had in a while.
6315.0,Patient,"But you take it when I take it, though."
198.0,Provider,"Like yeah, but you have been taken so I mean, but you have been taken, it to milligrams a day like you shouldn't have any difference in what you've been taken that's the part you."
6315.0,Patient,"know. Every single day until this morning, yes. Okay, so she's asking you when did you stop feeling okay and start feeling run."
198.0,Provider,yeah because you had when you told me that when you were taking two milligrams a day you were feeling okay and that's.
6315.0,Patient,"What. i'm listening so question I can't remember what happened two weeks ago, or yesterday I. feel like shit."
198.0,Provider,"And so. You took your last pill, this morning, and when you take your medicine, does it make the withdrawal symptoms go away."
6315.0,Patient,"Absolutely immediate. you're like within like an hour to an hour and a. Half, you said you did not take it, this. morning I didn't I wouldn't picked it up at nine did you take it, yes, just as he didn't Patrick if I don't take it i'm literally on the toilet that's all I do sit on the toilet."
198.0,Provider,"So you take it, and then you feel better for how long."
6315.0,Patient,"um so I took it at nine I still feel. Other than you know everything he's fucking telling me i'm. I feel I feel like my stomach I can deal with not having the knowledge is the main day like nausea and diarrhea. And so, as soon as it gets in my system fine and i'll be fine until tomorrow then i'm going to wake up and i'll take it again tomorrow morning, obviously, because I have it, but I didn't have it this morning."
198.0,Provider,"Right, but so you should have had it every day, and it should last 24 hours you know when you take it, because the box i'm really takes five days to get it out of your system, so I guess what i'm trying to figure out like. You know if you're taking it every day in the morning nine o'clock and it helps when you take it, and then it just wears off at some point, so that you needed in the morning at nine o'clock again, but when when it's all this diary and stuff happening."
6315.0,Patient,When I wake up like.
198.0,Provider,Right.
6315.0,Patient,Like i'm assuming.
198.0,Provider,uh huh.
6315.0,Patient,"And then, it takes me like two hours."
198.0,Provider,mm hmm and then so we talked about so are you taking a lot more gabapentin the mammal or how much gabapentin are you taking during the day.
6315.0,Patient,um well this morning I took to. yep Gavin gabba is tell Patrick what gabba.
198.0,Provider,"So gabapentin is a medication that's really an Anti sort of nerve pain medication it's used a lot calm alcohol cravings to calm anxiety. And it can help when people withdraw from opioids it can cause kind of nerve. nerve irritability muscle jerking things like that, and so it comes all that down so for three reasons, you know I told her that she can take up to six, a day so part of the thing is. You know, rather than being dependent on this one medicine to control all her symptoms that she can take. Two gabapentin three times a day she can take two extra frank tylenol she can take four advil at a time, three times a day that there are a lot of different medications you know that she can take to help ease the symptoms right to to. Rather than just relying on this this op medication so that's why i'm asking you know we talked about using those three medications hot bath mindfulness a a meetings like all those tools that they're like seven or eight tools that you can use. So that you so that you're not just relying on that one pill. Right, particularly for those couple of hours if it's only a couple of hours a day that you feel badly, you know that's a little that's that's sort of expected right and opiate withdrawal, which is why I was saying. You know if you continue to take opioids you're always going to have a little bit of your withdrawal right. And so that's why I was kind of saying you know before the week before thanksgiving you were so close and if you stopped it you'd be done with it, you know you have a few days, where you'd probably feel pretty bad, but then you would be done with it. it's just a matter of."
6315.0,Patient,"This is the first time that i've had him involved in us understand that, like if i'm gonna be sick like I can't. The fear of those couple days like i'm already feel like i'm. Always sick so."
198.0,Provider,So I think in just Patrick knows about the the experience that you had with the precipitated withdrawal.
6315.0,Patient,He didn't ever listen but. I told him yes. He Patrick and understand any of this he's is so out of his realm of normal.
198.0,Provider,Would you like me to explain explain this to him.
6315.0,Patient,"Yes, ma'am."
198.0,Provider,"Sir Okay, so you know our plan along Sarah Sarah actually has been doing amazing like she you know, since since i've been seeing her you know a lot of things she's come stable in a program done the yoga got the job you know all the kinds of things you know, making him."
6315.0,Patient,"yeah she she hasn't been doing a meeting and the better part of four to five months, maybe, maybe longer. that's not true, it is true, since school, since I started school absolutely. I don't want to argue over this stuff but he has not been she's not been to a very long time."
198.0,Provider,"So. The. The trajectory of what I had outside the trajectory of what I have seen you know in our meetings. Is that she was on quite a bit more suboxone you know that had been feeling very stable wanted to tie trade off on her own that was. Her decision you know we decided this was just a temporary thing because there's likely to have been a lot of fentanyl contaminated and cocaine's class all sorts of other things she was having what were very similar to, if you would withdrawal symptoms at the beginning, which are very. Very difficult, as you can see right there very physically demanding kind of withdrawal symptoms, so the suboxone stabilize things out. Sarah on her I knew, she was feeling better that like this about someone's making her tired, we had talked all along that it would be a very temporary thing until she could get stabilized out. She felt good enough to get a job right do other sorts of things, so we felt like her function was improving all that time to come down on the suboxone are we on the same page, with all that. Everybody. yeah Okay, so at that time we started turning off the suboxone and. at her peak sear were you at eight at your peak 1616 so she came down from 16 to eight pretty quickly there might have been a stop in there and then we stayed at eight I think for a month two months, maybe. And then we decided to go down to four right so she was doing really well through all this actually and. From from what from what I was told him what the therapist and Bob Luther King was told was saying, then I think. My understanding and please correct me if i'm wrong, she was doing so well you know and just was ready to be done, you know, like I don't need this medicine anymore i'm ready to be done and. Had when she came out of rehab had been given a medicine called naltrexone and now tracks on something you're supposed to take. Just like an abuse, when you come out of rehab and you're on nothing they give you naltrexone and antabuse to take so that if you do take opioids or you do take alcohol, nothing will happen. that's the purpose of those so in sarah's mind, this is a completely logical thing to think. She was like okay i'm gonna get back on these medicines, so if I trade off too quick if i'm being too ambitious about this i'll have these guardrails in place these two medicines right. The problem is that if you take now tricks and when you already have a few words in your system which she still was on some suboxone and you take naltrexone. The naltrexone will bump all of the weight off of the receptors and send you into the worst withdrawal of your life. Like way worse than what she's experiencing now like miserable withdrawal and then nothing you can do taking a bunch of suboxone to try to reverse it doesn't work, because the naltrexone is sitting there on the receptor. So I think what has happened and Sarah and i've talked about this is that that's a terrifying thing to happen right she thought she was doing something to make yourself better. She accidentally made herself worse and then she couldn't get herself out of that withdrawal, for many, many days, because the naltrexone was sitting there on the receptor. Then she was taking suboxone you know, to try to get herself out of it, it didn't work right, nothing was happening so now what has happened is there's fear involved right because there's this fear that the withdrawal that any withdrawal symptom that she has is going to end up being. That severe right because that was a horrific experience for her so. So I think every time. A little bit of withdrawal symptom comes you know, even if it seems insignificant to you or to me, Patrick you know that two hours is going to bring up in her body, a lot of fight or flight response right which, in a brain that is already sort of prone to fight or flight response and. addiction response can lead to a lot of significant sort of anxiety that makes pain worse that makes craving worse that makes withdrawal symptoms worse and all that kind of stuff do you see what I mean."
6315.0,Patient,I think I do yeah.
198.0,Provider,"yeah so so so that's why you know, in my mind, in some ways she's so close you know so we've had this conversation and there's no keep in mind there's no right or wrong way for this, I want to have the least. I want to have the least impact on you know your family your holidays her work as possible right, but we all are on the same page, I believe that she still wants to come off the suboxone try to come off the suboxone right."
6315.0,Patient,hundred percent.
198.0,Provider,"Patrick do you have any feelings, one way or the other about that."
6315.0,Patient,yeah I mean I wanted to be off any and all opioids I wonder to be off any mood altering over the counter stuff like these delta eight something is terrible for um but yeah absolutely. and You have to also understand the series not being very forthright with you. At all i'm hearing a lot of this stuff for the first time and she's. Serious very skillful skillful. liar and she'll tell you that.
198.0,Provider,I see.
6315.0,Patient,"let's talk about what I lie about please. Good. You can't say you can't make a comment like that okay i'm not follow it up you just did it you haven't been to a and well over she just mentioned all the things that I could do, I was doing yoga every fucking day until I went back to work."
198.0,Provider,yeah.
6315.0,Patient,"But true either. I mean, do you want me to go where it was months ago it was three, four or five months ago when you're doing yoga every day, you also say that i've been like this for three years, your timelines change every fucking."
198.0,Provider,"minute okay so either way so so one thing that we that we can all agree on this is really difficult on everybody, you know, in the family on everybody. And it's not a matter of you know. Right wrong necessarily that i'm being really particular about the timeline just because i'm trying to tease out what's what's what, in terms of the symptoms. But i'm not picking on Sarah for what she's doing you know, this is a very difficult for all of us, you know for everybody involved, this is a very difficult situation. And now her body is dependent on these opioids right, so I mean this is a whole, this is a it's hard for her to come off from she's having withdrawal symptoms right. Just like she was having before it's just now, we had something to give her right so that kind of stabilize out and now we're getting to the point in the process where. She has nothing right or in her mind there's nothing right there's no alcohol there's no opioids and maybe Patrick like you said y'all might be working towards she. or she may be working towards your desires, of course, to come off the delta eight but that might be something she's using as coping right too so it's really hard. For particularly somebody who's been used to having a substance for many, many years, whatever that substances to the idea of having nothing. You know that you can just reach for and that has an immediate predictable response can be very scary right can be very scary and those other things. Like a and yoga and all those other things they take time and we support them, and that means sarah's been seeing our therapist Julie, to try to. To try to encourage those sorts of things to it is in a brain that is hooked on a. pill, you know or a quick fix those things are harder, you know those things are harder to do in the moment and sometimes the brain can get very overwhelmed I think you've seen like Sarah can get. In in her own words, you can get very overwhelmed you know your brain doesn't quite think right when you're experiencing withdrawal symptoms and all that kind of stuff so i'm not making excuses, you know i'm not trying to make excuses i'm just. i'm just describing that this is why i'm asking. and reiterating all these things for you and Patrick i'm glad you're here so that you can help you know things get over if overwhelming you know we can have a plan for sort of. What we'll do together moving forward right, and so I want you guys to know what the deal is so back to the part about."
6315.0,Patient,"What i'm involved like i'm happy that this is happening. But at the same time, like what you just said, the demands like we just went on a 30 minute walk and everything that expected of me right now, like I can't I can't even like make it make sense, we can tell me what they are yeah Teller so. sarah's co handling ruining. Her addiction problem is ruining our our lives. it's tearing the kids apart it's tearing us apart, we can't do it any longer. So I spoke with her family today and there's things that she's going to have to do. To make this relationship work going forward, and the first thing and most important is she's gonna have to attend in a meeting every single day. no excuses anything outside of emergency or you know the kids welfare that's got to happen. She has got to let go and she's got to quit lying to me. To you, to her family to everybody. She can't keep her head on straight because she doesn't she can't keep up with what law, she stole. It it's become it's."
198.0,Provider,"So you can. Okay, I hear you."
6315.0,Patient,"I hate your examples, please. seriously. Well, I tell her what. You talk to your family about. about our relationship. you're speaking hateful as a gift, what do you want me to do. You. see what I mean she's."
198.0,Provider,"So, so one thing I want you both to that we can all acknowledge. This is really, really difficult this is, this is addiction is a difficult thing for everybody there's no question about it, I also want to acknowledge that Sarah has made progress she's not using right true not using cocaine, not using alcohol."
6315.0,Patient,I don't know that. He doesn't believe anything else.
198.0,Provider,"Well, I can tell you that from the drug screens that we regularly do we do regularly. We do have done regular drug screens at least every month, sometimes more often than a month and Sarah and nothing has ever come up at Th E. And suboxone since she's been in the program so I can I can vouch for her that from at least all the things she shows up for. Every single appointment i've asked her to show up for she's shown up for therapy appointments I know it's been difficult financially for you guys but she's really. she's really needed it as most people do as everybody does in this situation, she has been really compliant she's been really participatory she's been really trying. And now she went from when I first saw her to you know getting into even though it may have laughs when she started her job you know. getting into a yoga program getting into alcoholics anonymous getting to the point where she felt like she could get a job, and those are big steps for somebody that was everyday just out of rehab using cocaine and alcohol almost every day, I mean that's a that's a those are those are."
6315.0,Patient,she's been out of rehab for over a year.
198.0,Provider,"Right it's and I know it's hard to understand. it's progress sort of not perfection with these sorts of things you know and the addiction can have a little bit of a wavy course overall you know the big thing is that she's sober you know that she really is. It from the drugs of choice that she came to treatment for. And that being said, there's no question that it's very difficult because you know all the issues that make people use don't go away when they get sober right. And they certainly can take a lot of time. Has anybody talked to you and Patrick about Al anon or any of those types of meetings support groups for people that live with alcoholics."
6315.0,Patient,I about a year ago yeah.
198.0,Provider,Have you and have you ever tried those like on zoom or anything like that.
6315.0,Patient,I have not.
198.0,Provider,"So I would suggest to both of you guys, I mean I can't suggest I can't more highly suggest 12 step programs just for being free and accessible, you know I know going to a many meetings is really helpful in that kind of thing, but if you're busy and working and holidays. zoom meetings they have 24 hour a day all you have to do is Google zoom or online a meetings or online Al anon meetings that kind of thing and some of it, Patrick just may be helpful to be around other people that are dealing with family members that have alcoholism."
6315.0,Patient,be happy to. Do it i'm not doing it via zoom i'll go to a meeting.
198.0,Provider,"i'll go yeah. Go to the system Okay, if they are available yeah and you guys prioritize that I think that's wonderful."
6315.0,Patient,But there's more to her recovery than eating dope.
198.0,Provider,yeah and.
6315.0,Patient,This is what we're doing here is never going to work.
198.0,Provider,And what What do you mean.
6315.0,Patient,Eating drugs.
198.0,Provider,"is not that. yeah yeah and so that's what we're working on, I mean honestly, that is what we're working on. Now. I don't know how you guys feel about their their different ways to continue working on it, it may not happen, I feel very strongly that we can that will be off of these medications why told Sarah mom my medical license in North Carolina expires. At the end of the year, and so I can always transfer her to another provider in North Carolina if it really feels like she needs the medicines to be stable but Sarah has committed that we really committed to kind of working on coming off these medicines like after thanksgiving. Now suboxone is a really long. Acting medication so Sarah you've already seen, you know that you can get some withdrawal symptoms so they're never going to get as bad as your precipitated withdrawal was you know, and you do have."
6315.0,Patient,"yeah i'm sorry, why do we, why do we not you off of the last week."
198.0,Provider,"So. Sarah had been we had been coming down about a month at a time, so the whole plan that we made all along that she was complying with she's complying with the plan. You know, eight eight milligrams for a couple of months and we do four milligrams for a month two milligrams for a month two milligrams every month and off okay two milligrams every other day for a month and then off. So she went to four milligrams for just two weeks, and then she went to two milligrams for like a week and then wanted to stop. And that would have been fine too, because people can tie trade off really quickly, but the plan that I had made with Sarah was that we would do it like a month at a time, you know so that she could. She could do it faster if she wanted to, but I didn't want her to feel anxious and pressured and do it too soon so that's why we did that, but the plan all along, has been for her to come down. While it was wow. You know, while while it's kind of a controlled manner because she felt like that would give her enough time to get those other. tools and coping mechanisms in place get the prescriptions for the gabapentin as a friend, you know get back into a meetings get back into her therapy get back into your yoga all that kind of stuff. So now we're finding that you know we can continue to encourage that right those those sorts of things, because the next time you know when her medicine runs out, which is going to be not this Thursday but next Thursday right here, I think that's the number of refills that you have left."
6315.0,Patient,"I don't think, so I think it's this Thursday."
198.0,Provider,"This Thursday. That we've been going to to sort of every other day. And then off. So there'll be a period of time and, like, I told her if there's a time the worst part of the withdrawal is she would just stop it right now, like never take another pill, the worst part of the withdrawal being the next five days."
6315.0,Patient,"And i'm sorry Patrick but like I can't play I haven't been able to like okay i'm just gonna do this, this weekend, you know, like, I thought they were going to be going to soccer. So when I thought that was happening okay that's just a minute and I could do it, and then soccer was here, and I mean I can't yeah, this is the first time he's ever listened to any of this."
198.0,Provider,"This is already brought this shit up. This is very difficult for everybody, I mean it really is, I know it's difficult for everybody patreon know it's hard for you, I know it's hard for the family and know it's hard. Everything Sarah and I feel you I get it, you know it's just it's very. there's nothing easy about this, you know, and I wish that you could come off opioids slow enough that you wouldn't have withdrawal, but that's just not the way it is okay. And we also have to recognize the. This is when you got to double down on those tools, you know if you've seen if you need additional zoom meetings and additional in person meetings, if you have to. If you have to pause I know you don't want to, but if you have to pause work for a period of time to do recovery, if you really can't do it at home and need to go back as an impatient Those are all options, I think he can do it at home, but if you can't, then you know. there's going to be a rocky patch basically, I just want everybody know there's going to be a rocky patching coming off of it right. Patrick. What he said."
6315.0,Patient,"I don't know what he wants to hear, he said he's got a good. i'm saying this is like he can't he can't comprehend this he doesn't take an advil so I mean. i'm just. You want to at least somebody knows you want to lead raider your list yeah. This is, this is what I have to do to be able to stay in this House. I mentioned a."
198.0,Provider,"Okay Okay, can we stop there just with each one of those Sarah do you feel like you can do a."
6315.0,Patient,You.
198.0,Provider,can commit to that okay. Because that's going to be helpful for this to you know that you'll have some support okay we're all in the page with that.
6315.0,Patient,"The second one she's already gone released writes. The doctor patient rights, let me be in all these meetings. and The third is i'm wanted her to tell you, everything that she's been on and for how long I don't think she's done that. Okay. Give them. Well, I mean she knows what it takes okay good I want her."
198.0,Provider,He feel like I know that Patrick I mean it was.
6315.0,Patient,"No, I don't."
198.0,Provider,"Okay, Sarah do you want to tell me."
6315.0,Patient,"So take for panel. beta Blocker yep yeah and I take. So loft. i'm not on interviews anymore, I take the suboxone. For withdrawal symptoms have gabapentin so for him and anti. diarrhea stuff. we're not over the counter so. Nothing."
198.0,Provider,was a delta eight.
6315.0,Patient,"Okay don't say that doesn't count money. No accounts Okay, what else. I mean that's it yeah. No other offers no other pills nothing, do you want i've been begging you to do a drug test do."
198.0,Provider,"She I know she had a drug test, two weeks ago that was. Normal I mean not had the head thc and it's about sending it."
6315.0,Patient,"Right. Those are scheduled right. They may here and then. Those offers and different types of pills can get in and out of your system within a few days, I believe."
198.0,Provider,"yeah so normally if people take things like Center mean, which is like a diet pill or. Ritalin any of that kind of stuff it will show up in the in the drug screen yeah it doesn't last as long as thc which is like 30 days, but you can normally pick it up within about three days. Just like just like other stimulants like cocaine and things."
6315.0,Patient,I wanted her to talk to you about only. Taking her zoloft or whatever it's called and the beta Blocker ultimately that's what I want. Her to achieve is where she's not on any. opioids at all.
198.0,Provider,yeah and we're working on that and the goal is that in.
6315.0,Patient,Reading the list.
198.0,Provider,I made it perfect yep yep.
6315.0,Patient,"um. I wonder, to get all delta eight. and see if it makes a difference. With her mood. Okay um. I don't there's no way that this could be good fanatic there's just no way."
198.0,Provider,"Okay, and."
6315.0,Patient,"I don't have a PhD I don't i'm not a medical doctor but i've taken it i've taken it for restoration uses it is absolutely there's no possible way, a medical professional could allow an addict to be abusing dealt a there's no way."
198.0,Provider,"So to Patrick i'll let you know, in the addiction world. We do we prioritize things so sort of if you wanted to sort of yank everything away. If somebody is on a bunch of substances that's much safer done as an impatient if you come out and they're on other they're on like. cocaine and alcohol and other sorts of things we prioritize, what are the most damaging consider the most damaging about a patient. And the most potentially life threatening which we did she got rid of the sort of alcohol and cocaine and then we stabilized out with a few it's because that was what was sort of driving her craving to use a lot of different things when that stabilized out. Then she's on opioids in the delta T the delta eight or the thc so we prioritize getting off the opioids first because they're the most dangerous in terms of fiscal addiction and that kind of thing and then we would prioritize prioritize coming off it's kind of like when in. rehabs they they let cigarettes go till the end right because they are like this sort of least life, I mean there are long term life threatening but. In terms of overdose deaths."
6315.0,Patient,etc are not addictive.
198.0,Provider,hmm.
6315.0,Patient,delta eight and thc is not addictive.
198.0,Provider,"know so the idea is, if you use it for a coping skill that's what i'm saying, if you use it for coping it's not as healthy as the other strategies we like that we don't try to. tell people to come off that immediately, while we're trying to get them off the more difficult stuff first, so I don't I don't discount I don't disagree with you that coming off of the delta eight is a is a good idea and somebody that has an addiction, but we're just sort of prioritizing. Time."
6315.0,Patient,"I, the reason I bring it up is because, just like everything with thc and delta eight it makes one lethargic and makes one lazy and makes one kind of disregard all accountability. That kind of sums up or character right now okay."
198.0,Provider,"And I, and I can see that. And I hear you and you say that and I think getting her off the few it's if if she didn't have that that Sarah maybe tell tell tell me why you use what symptoms you're controlling when you take the the delta eight, what are you taking it for what do you think it does for you."
6315.0,Patient,"I mean, I think it just makes me feel calm, make sure it gets fucked up."
198.0,Provider,"yeah and and so some of the some of the one of the biggest drivers for craving to use things like. Like opioids, for instance, is anxiety right. And so, definitely. We definitely want to manage anxiety so i'm not a psychiatrist you know i'm an anesthesiologist and the pain doctor and addiction specialist. But I work with psychologists and psychiatrists and so we're trying to work on managing her anxiety, I think, for primary care doctor is the one who writes rizal off does that right. yep so again my i'm just trying to let you know this is frustrating, I know, in terms of the medical stuff but you know we're a little siloed you know all the different doctors doing different things. So, for my part, my role for her is try to get her off the opioids with this little sort of rebound. Understand anxiety as possible, because many coping skills as much therapeutic support, as we can have. So she can get off the opioids and then the other sorts of things you know the the managing the. anxiety for what she takes the the delta eight and all that other kind of stuff that's non-prescriptive right and it's not going to cause her to die, you know she relapses you know we can deal with that. With their psychiatrist psychologist and PCP all that kind of stuff afterwards, at least in my mind that's the kind of. strategy that I have for that."
6315.0,Patient,"All right, let me finish this then we'll circle back to it. Okay um I told her that I wanted to have a new sponsor by the end of the year or a sponsor by the end of the year today. I want her to cut out one of her friends for at least a year her name's brooke she is directly or indirectly involved with sarah's abuse over the years. She was indirectly, the way that Sarah found cocaine, she was directly involved with how Sarah got pills of all sorts she had a couple of different ways of getting it, but this person is a trigger and she's a mess herself and. She enables Sarah and every. Every one way possible right now I don't want to run our life period."
198.0,Provider,For at least a year Sarah will that be difficult for you.
6315.0,Patient,"I mean, I even see her we just text they enable or I don't want to i'm not going to argue about it but there's no doubt she's she has substance abuse issues I don't know if they've been dealt with or not, but there's no. hiding the fact that she was the one. That got Sarah hooked up on yeah yeah don't okay."
198.0,Provider,Patrick do you believe that sarah's prioritizing her sobriety is like the number one most important thing to be able to keep her family intact.
6315.0,Patient,say that again i'm sorry.
198.0,Provider,"You believe that series really trying prioritizing her sobriety right now, so that she can try to keep her family intact."
6315.0,Patient,"y'all think it's a high priority, yes."
198.0,Provider,"that's what i've seen too, so I just want y'all to remember that to that no matter what's going on here that she really is trying, you know she knows that if she's not sober she loses her family."
6315.0,Patient,there's other ways that she's gonna lose her family and. Being with this person is going to be one oh.
198.0,Provider,"Right right, and I know that I just I just want to."
6315.0,Patient,I know I know I know a do not doubt her desire to make this work out do not doubt that one day.
198.0,Provider,"And she's making it and she's been making progress, she has been making some we can acknowledge that she's made some progress since a year ago. Not using. And just some of this underlying stuff is coming out, which is communication and family release in relationships and other sorts of stuff so it's kind of the next level that we're working on now. Right like."
6315.0,Patient,"I know what she she wants to go back into rehab and that's not going to be an option. I think. You know the thought or for going into a a month six week or. Of 12 week program is just not something that. i'm going to do. Should you do it if she wants to. She wants to do it, we could split and she can do it. But i'm not going to be a part of that anymore."
198.0,Provider,"And, can you tell me a little bit about that now, first of all, I will say that Sarah has told me multiple times, she wants to do it on our end that she doesn't want to go back in. that she thinks she can do this on our own so that's the message that i've been receiving but i'm just curious why you are."
6315.0,Patient,"Different conversations with her family. it's just been in the past three days it's not i've never brought it you go call them and ask you think a lot about everything, I promise you until I felt like shit and I felt like I just missed out on a lot. thanksgivings I didn't feel good she's mentioned it before just this past weekend to her brother. Again this, this is my list i'm not arguing about this."
198.0,Provider,"Okay i'm just i'm just curious why you're why you're against it, so that when we make a treatment plan, I want you to be on board with it."
6315.0,Patient,"Certainly, so i'm not going to do this again in a year, this is it either, this is going to work for her and we're going to make our way through this or we're not. I cannot watch our family fall apart, any more than where it's at right now we're at the end, so this is what I want to see done to see her do. To make this this work."
198.0,Provider,And do you have a particular Tom course that thing and how will you know if things are better.
6315.0,Patient,"But no, I do not, I do not have. Any timeframe wrapped around on this box. She. You. know the way that she goes about life right now it's not something I can I can live with okay do it."
198.0,Provider,at any point over this past year Have you considered what she's done to be an improvement ever before she went in rehab.
6315.0,Patient,yeah yeah of course yeah.
198.0,Provider,And when was that.
6315.0,Patient,"When she was really. yeah when she was really hitting the a hard talking to me about it, even when she was even backing off a which is earlier this year and going more towards yoga I could still see her I could see. Even, especially in a she was happier she was a happier person and there was there's there's no doubting that. haven't literally can only get myself to work right now I don't know what the Fuck else to say."
198.0,Provider,"So, so I think, so what is coming together is she was doing really well until that precipitated withdrawal event."
6315.0,Patient,Okay yeah that's over.
198.0,Provider,"Yet so so like I said that was that was the event and then since that time, all the weaning and any withdrawal symptoms that she has is triggering a lot of sort of. anxiety and distress that that."
6315.0,Patient,we're going to have a meeting.
198.0,Provider,"Certain cinema i'm just saying that that's i'm just putting the Tom course together i'm not discounting that she should be going to a meetings, I agree with you, I think, and I think Sarah agrees with you. it's just for and i'm not trying to make excuses i'm just i'm just noting in the timeline that we're all on the same page that we were everybody was agree that we were making progress until that precipitated withdrawal of it and then we're back slid and since then."
6315.0,Patient,"But that's my point you know if we go into rehab again, you know what's The excuse next time when she backs. You know what."
198.0,Provider,"I think she's gonna be able to get through it, I think she's gonna be able to get through it as an outpatient."
6315.0,Patient,I do too now think it's going to take a day to do it.
198.0,Provider,yep.
6315.0,Patient,And I think it's going to take a lifetime of it.
198.0,Provider,yeah that's fine.
6315.0,Patient,"She can't commit to that, then she she can't commit to the family."
198.0,Provider,There you said you're recommitting to a year is that what you said.
6315.0,Patient,there's nothing I ever learned more.
198.0,Provider,And that yeah I remember you saying that.
6315.0,Patient,it's just you know that's the end of the list the last one is if she can cannot comply with this stuff then she needs to move out. And i've no desire to get a divorce and to go through the rigmarole i'll just sell everything we only give her half of it. I don't.
198.0,Provider,well.
6315.0,Patient,I think don't. Know i've been dismembered to to divorce her to go fight this out for the children to be nasty.
198.0,Provider,Every respect all that I wanted to let you know i'm not like a marriage therapist or a second.
6315.0,Patient,zero.
198.0,Provider,"yeah well what I am what I am trained in is you know this medical part of it, and I think i'm really glad that we're all on the same page about this, and so. Sarah I think that you can agree that, no matter how you know that you when you take your medicine. You know the days you take your mess and you feel pretty good so you can manage to get to an eight time your medicine, or whatever you need to do. That you can make in a meeting in person or even in person and the zoom when you can do to a day if you want to do a zoom one at night, whatever, but you can make these meetings, no matter if you feel like crap because there are hours of the day, where you don't feel like crap right. That that if you're taking the gabapentin desert fran and the imodium that are prescribed in addition to your suboxone or just for the withdrawal period, you will not be on those long term they'll be stopped, is once you're off the suboxone. That we're working on coming off the suboxone over the next month. yeah. So, essentially, we can get. So this is December 1 tomorrow so you'll get 15 pills for December. mm hmm that's an average of one every other day right so or you can take one a day for another week and then you know less, but you make those 15 pills last."
6315.0,Patient,Okay.
198.0,Provider,"A recommendation like I said, is to talk with Patrick find a time where you know you have a weekend where, if you feel bad you might not feel bad because you've been sort of withdrawing all along here. yeah So if you feel bad that you can take the medicines, whatever, but that, no matter how bad you feel you will not take more than prescribed, and you will go to a meetings as many as it takes."
6315.0,Patient,Right.
198.0,Provider,You will try to do some sort of yoga even if it's home yoga. On every day and Patrick you'll be supportive of her if she needs time to do these things.
6315.0,Patient,he's talking to him i'm sorry molly's. got soccer he just wanted to talk to her.
198.0,Provider,"and Patrick you'll be supportive of her, she needs time for one or two meetings a day and some time to do yoga whatever."
6315.0,Patient,If she it's all about scheduling. You know I. schedule my stuff up pretty well in advance so. You know.
198.0,Provider,Can y'all work together on making sure that that you'll have a schedule that you can both agree on for this.
6315.0,Patient,If she wasn't morning I got the kids if she wants to bed at night. i'll make arrangements whenever it doesn't matter of she always she's always know that i'm not reason she's not going.
198.0,Provider,"To say or you can work around that for the next for for this month prioritizing those things prioritize your yoga prioritize the thing. See Julie, once a week, if you can, if y'all can forward it to see Julie, once a week, while you're going through this period you'll see me once a week, while you're going through this. and take the gabba pit and if you need it, you have to have them three times a day, you can take ibuprofen that will help with muscle aches nausea stuffing take this oh fran imodium take ginger ginger tea helps a lot with knowledge. it's not going to kill you it's not life threatening it will never get as bad as it was you know use your meditation use your know yoga if you find yourself panicking and worrying about it because, remember, just like your kids when they get nervous what happens their tummy aches. Right, so when you get stressed out that thing. Every worse, and it has nothing to it has to do with you know your acupuncture point for no."
6315.0,Patient,"No, I do because they have those."
198.0,Provider,bases thickness bracelets exactly. So press like the Dickens right there right in the middle and that crease where your wrist is held on.
6315.0,Patient,here.
198.0,Provider,"right in the middle dig your fingernail in there, so hard that you know until you can't take it anymore that's an excellent knowledge, a point."
6315.0,Patient,Really.
198.0,Provider,"it's it's the only acupuncture point that has excellent randomized control trial data in the literature, for being effective it's more effective than zero frame for pitstop nausea and vomiting after anesthesia. So use that acupuncture point use ginger cheese ginger tea so fran imodium if you need it and just know stress management breathing techniques, whatever guided meditation you need that will help the knowledge and diarrhea you're almost you're almost to the finish line here with this."
