5393.0,Patient,So depressed i've been definitely depressed so I feel okay today.
431.0,Provider,You only good day um yeah it can definitely help with that and then just really quick about your other medication the seroquel you're taking a total of 500 milligrams a day is that right a 401 hundred together. Correct okay with your current medications any issues with dizziness drowsiness. that's impacting your daily function you already feel dizzy drowsy.
5393.0,Patient,"Oh no, no, no, no, no i'm I have. Out of all of them have a great side effect just a little bit of tremors but it's okay."
431.0,Provider,Okay How long have you had that.
5393.0,Patient,"I mean you know. It started more about six eight months ago. It it's it's it's not bad i've told chantelle and she gave me something for but I don't need to take it yet until I you know it prevents me from doing something, but I feel fine with that."
431.0,Provider,"Okay um we do want to monitor Ter that basically because you are on basically and, and so the circle lesson and tights gets an Anti psychotic medication to kind of help stabilize people's thoughts, one of the side effects that we want to monitor again is any irregular muscle movements. So we think."
5393.0,Patient,I do have that a little bit.
431.0,Provider,yeah but obviously it's always a risk versus benefit.
5393.0,Patient,Right it's way better.
431.0,Provider,"yeah i'm glad to hear that, so as far as your lithium you haven't started it. And what's your lithium The one thing that your pharmacist is probably concerned with its is its interaction with serotonin so you're happy hormones and your brain when there's too much of it, the issue is that it can cause a rare but pretty serious side effect call serotonin syndrome. You may have already read about it with your sertraline medication so with lithium that's The one thing that we want to make sure you're aware of, you could use it together, but I want you to be. Understand kind of what to look out for so serotonin syndrome actually do you know much about it, or what to monitor for."
5393.0,Patient,yeah I had that I spoke at the pharmacist about that.
431.0,Provider,"Okay, so any like you know sweating worsening tremors major mood changes or feeling like. Your muscles are hyper reflecting so all those are signs and symptoms and you need to basically stop the medications right away and go to the emergency room for immediate assistance. That said, again it's rare We just have to monitor and that's something i'm going to ask you to do a night I think shauntel did also put in some baseline labs for you. yeah okay yeah so with lithium super important we need to monitor your kidney function. We also have to check your thyroid level I don't know if you recently had those done. i'm just as a baseline, then the recommendations we actually have to basically monitor you basically every three months for the first six months so you'll have to do it twice. In addition to that, and this is just to make sure nothing it's not affecting your kidneys in a way that we don't want to, and then the lithium itself, so we don't know what goes is going to work for you, yet she has it currently written for basically start with the one. Wait hold on, let me find the. The actual note. For it. Because she's she's going to start you on a slow taper so. She wants you to start with. one. or 311 tablet at bedtime for three to four days, and you can go to two tablets at bedtime for three to four days, then she wants to add kind of three tablets to at night, and one in the morning. yeah I see okay perfect um, but we will need to ask you to get some labs just so we can monitor where you're at because there's kind of a goal range where we want the lithium level to be, and that can be up to weekly while you're finding the right dose for you."
5393.0,Patient,"So maybe So if I started tonight, should I get alive on Monday, or like Friday."
431.0,Provider,"Oh um. It doesn't matter Monday, probably better. If it works out. With your schedule."
5393.0,Patient,I mean yeah yeah.
431.0,Provider,"If you have to so that's what I will say Mondays my better, because then you get the full week and then by then, you also have your dose up and so because I don't think I want to days to get you to the right level for now. um so okay. um so shontelle is aware, I actually spoke with her about what the recommendations are for all of your medications, taken together, there is no major interactions like you cannot combine them, the recommendation is just a monitor and we are going to monitor so for you. Please let us know keep us in the loop again with any of the symptoms. sweating muscle tremors."
5393.0,Patient,"I do, I do sweat at night, normally, but if it, you know double then i'll check it up."
431.0,Provider,"you're right You know yourself the best, so I think whatever that's outside of your baseline so you know I always. seem to do a body scan all those."
5393.0,Patient,"Just to see how yeah that's sorry to interrupt but yeah, no, no, no, I feel I feel like i'm proud of myself, because I do that."
431.0,Provider,"So great I think sometimes people don't realize how valuable, that is just to kind of base. And then whenever you start any new medications you know it's obviously always a risk."
5393.0,Patient,"versus benefit ratio what you know what i'll probably do is just like a little journal, you know start with how i'm feeling and then, if anything goes like this top of that that will be something I will do, because you know. My and."
431.0,Provider,that's a great idea journaling especially so you don't have to remember how you felt from day to day. yeah yeah um and then what's lithium just are you normally pretty good at staying hydrated.
5393.0,Patient,"yeah i'm gonna take it with food and drink water water, I had my daughter by the bed for what i'm going to take it yeah."
431.0,Provider,"Definitely so that's just the one thing about lithium we just don't want people to become dehydrated because i'm not getting impact their kidneys all kind of it goes viral so just you don't have to overdo it just continue with what you normally would. Okay um, let me just double check, here again, so your medication, right now, has already been sent to your pharmacy which is. CVs okay CVs on 41st avenue. Okay yeah and under. 300 milligrams 300 milligrams what was sent in and then again ultimately is two tabs up at time one time in the morning. cool yeah so that's it we. shauntel is aware, now that i'm happy, you came through to talk about it."
5393.0,Patient,Oh yeah I feel great i'm like I said I. i've been more depressed than i've ever been and i'm just so looking forward to hopefully not being. Thank you so much. you're the best pharmacist i've ever met Thank you.
431.0,Provider,"I appreciate that Lindsay but so keep us posted I am available and around i'm not always in the virtual clinic, but if you want, you can always reach out, and I can always give you a call or let you know we can meet you back in here, you know I like facetime. So you can feel free to come back in if you have questions, but again shauntel is aware of all the monitoring recommendations from. Laos just know that when they may be reaching out to ask you to get those done she'll probably put in a standing order. Since there, and you can show up together done. Okay anything else, I can help you with."
5393.0,Patient,"Trade and. i'm just gonna do everything you said yeah and not and not worry about it, you know."
431.0,Provider,"don't worry about it, I mean, I think I like your idea with journaling that's like one of the best things you can do right now, just to monitor even the mood because it goes up it goes up and down right someone can be a. driver record day."
5393.0,Patient,"it's a given take but Oh, and I just thought what i'll probably do is the baseline like. One through five five being sweaty. And then, if I go over that that I know."
431.0,Provider,"yeah, so I think for you, since this wedding is already kind of a baseline the tremors I think we probably add that in your Journal and then just your mood. How it's impacting me because i'm hoping you'll get some relief, with the lithium."
5393.0,Patient,yeah. yeah i'm excited. Oh Thank you so much.
431.0,Provider,"yeah Oh, and one thing you should probably know so with any medication that works in the brain, I will say unfortunately we don't have like a magic cold way to say this is going to work for you. there's always some level of file in there to see if it works for you, you may already be familiar with this process but. I think just given through an expectation of how long it takes, because it does take a while for the medications to build up. And again, everybody process this lithium differently and that's what we're getting the blood test and make sure we're bringing you up to the right level so have some patience. If you feel relief right away that's awesome i'm happy to hear it, but and also there may be that the level is just so low that we have to keep going up a little bit before we are at a good level to know if it's working or not so just expect that. Great okay yeah cool Lindsay you have a good rest of your day."
5393.0,Patient,"Okay, thank you."
431.0,Provider,"Okay hi. Lindsay napper date of birth of December 15 1982 was assisted in the rx build rsvp. rsvp unscheduled from 1130 to 1142 for a total of 12 minutes patient had questions in regards to her lithium you start as well as drug drug interactions with her existing. medication regimen review with patient lithium the interaction with her current term regimen to continue to monitor and there is no issue to take everything, at the same time. patient is aware of the side effects to monitor for for serotonin syndrome specifically and he's sweating a regular muscle movements impacted the mood. Patient will start journaling to kind of keep track of how she's doing at baseline as well as how the medication is impacting her when she starts. review with patient also the laboratory monitoring requirements for we know function tests, as well as thyroid patient is aware, patient and provider are aware that baseline laughs needs to be done, as well as follow up lives every three months for a total of six months, duration.
