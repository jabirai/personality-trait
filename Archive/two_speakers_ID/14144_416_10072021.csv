14144.0,Patient,i'm fine Thank you.
416.0,Provider,How have things been going since last time we talked.
14144.0,Patient,"Well it's been a really, really tough week I have a brother, that is terminally ill. and on he has cirrhosis of the liver late stages and he was on he called me up Saturday morning and said he wasn't feeling well and I recommended that he go to the emergency room and he's been there since. I had to drop I didn't have to I went Saturday evening to the bay area San Jose California, because he was critical and I stayed with him. On I just got home a couple hours ago, and he is still unstable when I left, he was stable but he's unstable again he's on his ninth blood transfusion right now."
416.0,Provider,How are you coping sorry.
14144.0,Patient,"I think i'm coping well, given the situation um. I I I realized because i'm pretty good with medical things I realized that right now he's touching go and I understand I see all the signs on. So i'm extremely worried and i'm a little stressed and even i'm feeling stressed, because I just got back, and I might have to go and not have to I might choose to go back again soon and that's a little stressful for me. The drive."
416.0,Provider,"yeah absolutely absolutely. So um. Last time we talked and I believe I gave you I need to look back through the notes, but I believe I gave you a little some a couple things to work on."
14144.0,Patient,Yes.
416.0,Provider,How. Half a second.
14144.0,Patient,"um I use the technique oh just one, second, let me decline this okay. A call was trying to come through I use the technique on and it helped."
416.0,Provider,"Tell me tell me about the technique, how did what did you do exactly."
14144.0,Patient,"Well, on I didn't go like verbatim off of it, but what I did is I tried to talk to my husband about on. Using heroin, yes, how he arm how I felt when he spoke to me in a certain manner. mm hmm and at first, he was unresponsive and I just kept on, and you know, on trying, through the steps, I did wasn't looking at them, those so that it was kind of hard, I was going off of my memory with you and our appointment on. Okay, but he calmed down a lot quicker than he has before. yeah and he was responsible lot quicker and then I felt like it carried through lumber, meaning that you know there, it seemed like it was a few days before there was any issue again at all. and Good I haven't. I haven't been home much this week, but he's been 100% supportive and helpful on and every single way financially emotionally in every way he possibly could and that's made me feel very good."
416.0,Provider,"Good okay well i'm happy to hear that, so it was the describe the situation. described the situation described the situation and express your feelings about a ask for what you need and then sort of reinforce right."
14144.0,Patient,Right right.
416.0,Provider,"So you kind of follow that general pattern. Yes, good can you think of any other areas in your life, where that might be useful."
14144.0,Patient,With my father my communication with my father definitely.
416.0,Provider,"yeah great. And, and then I think we, if I remember correctly. Change the notes aren't in yet, but um did we talk about breathing and grounding techniques."
14144.0,Patient,"I don't recall that, but we touched base on that in group therapy on Wednesday."
416.0,Provider,"hmm yeah we've we've we talked about that a lot. So that's the whole thing about mindfulness right and I have you heard that term. you've probably heard me, yes, that term yeah. Yes, and what what's your understanding of mindfulness."
14144.0,Patient,To be aware of the situation that you're in.
416.0,Provider,"yeah that's actually a great definition and so let's say. A lot of times with Depression and anxiety what happens is that we're not living in the moment right we're worrying about the future we're worrying about something that might never happen. we're stressing out and trying to prepare for the worst case scenario, and what if this and what if that and right Oh, this is going to be ruined for sure right. that's anxiety or we're thinking about our past. And something that we did or something that happened to us that we that were very disturbed by and then we keep reliving that."
14144.0,Patient,yeah right.
416.0,Provider,"So when we're when we have one foot in the past and one foot in the future. we're not in the present. Yes, right, so what mindfulness is our techniques to bring us into the present. which helps us really stay connected to the moment to appreciate the things that are happening right this moment, and a lot of times, the reason people get so stressed out or. start to think so much about the future or the past is because they've had a tough fast, and that was your sort of brain adapted by going okay well the President is too much for me to handle i'm not going to be here right i'm going to think about. Roger i'm going to relive the past because the brain."
14144.0,Patient,The present is awful yes.
416.0,Provider,"But we can't really change the present until we're in it right until we're focused on it. So mindfulness is really about bringing you into the moment and that's why I do those exercises at the beginning of group each time to try to bring us into the moment into our bodies into a place where we remember to breathe. Remember, to look around and see where we are and calm ourselves enough to respond to things in the moment in ways that we feel proud of later."
14144.0,Patient,Okay.
416.0,Provider,"And then another way of describing mindfulness is doing one thing at a time right, so instead of thinking about something else, while you're doing dishes it's literally just being there and focusing on okay my hands are wet this plate is still dirty i'm going to scrub this right or."
14144.0,Patient,"In front of you, I have a tendency to think about a lot of. Things at one time. And, to be honest, if i'm only thinking about one thing at a time, I feel very anxious."
416.0,Provider,mm hmm you're not alone it's a practice it's something that we have to get used to.
14144.0,Patient,Okay.
416.0,Provider,So um usually we can start like How was the when when I did the mindfulness exercising group were you able to focus.
14144.0,Patient,Well i'm not in your group I.
416.0,Provider,Know that's right you weren't in Sharon.
14144.0,Patient,i'm insurance group that I was a little confused there for a second i'm insurance group. and forgetting anything yet.
416.0,Provider,"How when they practice it, how is it for you."
14144.0,Patient,"um well, it was not on as thorough as right now with you and I talked to you about it um but that's because it's a big group can. You know it's hard."
416.0,Provider,Today do mindfulness exercises in group.
14144.0,Patient,"Well, no, they just touched on it on Wednesday. About breathing and not about mindfulness but about the breathing."
416.0,Provider,"techniques okay. You want to practice a little bit of mindfulness with me. Sure me teach you this, I have a favorite one me, let me see if I can find my favorite one I will walk you through this. Okay hold on. Let me find it really quick. One second. see if I can pull it up really quick. let's see. let's do this one. Okay, so um are you in a place where you can be alone and quiet for a few minutes."
14144.0,Patient,"Yes, okay."
416.0,Provider,"All right, so try to bring yourself just to a place of stillness find a position that you're comfortable in. Close your eyes. I mean just start with a big deep breath in through your lungs, through your mouth filling your lungs, I mean sorry, through your nose filling your lungs completely. Holding that breath at the top when it's completely full just pausing there for a moment. Before exhaling out of your mouth. May slow inhales and exhales let's do that again big deep breath in through your nose. holding it at the top for just a moment very gently. exhaling. When it feels like the right time. One more time big deep inhale. holding it just at the top of the breath and this time, when you exhale I want you to imagine letting go of something that isn't isn't feeling good today just breathing it out with your breath. Now go ahead and let your breathing return to normal. Just breathe just relax just see if you can become aware of your body in the space it's in right now. notice any any physical sensations maybe noticing the parts of your body that are touching the surface you're sitting on. noticing any smells around you. start to notice any thoughts that are coming up don't grab Ahold of them don't start thinking about them, but maybe imagine. Imagine that you're sitting on the top of a cliff. And you're looking down over the ocean. And there are boats floating by. and your thoughts are those boats you're not going to touch the boats or grab the boats you're going to observe them from afar. Just make sure you're continuing to breathe, as you watch your thoughts go by. Each side is a little boat. zoom out a little. See the ocean. The bigger part of the ocean, that the. That the thoughts are in noticing where they are in the ocean, maybe they're in the middle of the ocean, or are they close to shore. what's the water like. Are there waves, or is the ocean still. notice what time it is outside is it day or night. Continuing to breathe, I want you to zoom out even further. Until you can see the whole ocean. As if you could trace its outline with a crayon. What shape is that ocean. Are there any islands in it. What do you see around the ocean. zoom out a little further bring your attention to the planet, that the Ocean is on. earth, or perhaps a different planet. What does it look like from far away and how big is the ocean now. zoom out even further imagine the galaxy that this planets in. Is it big or is it small. Come on, back in let's zoom back. back to the place where you're sitting on the cliff overlooking the ocean. watching your thoughts go by. And, as each thought goes by without touching those thoughts or those boats just send a little love their way, a little compassion. Now, from where you're sitting right now start to bring your attention back into your body. feeling your body in the space it's in from the top of your head down to the soles of your feet. start to move your fingers and toes. start to bring in a sense of smell. See what's around you start to hear any noise is that you hear maybe things that you would otherwise usually not paid attention to it all. tune into them. Let them ground you in this moment. they're just the surface, that your hands are touching pay attention to the texture the temperature. Now, when you're ready go ahead and open your eyes. bring your attention back here."
14144.0,Patient,Okay.
416.0,Provider,How was that for you.
14144.0,Patient,"It was good, it was a lot like meditation."
416.0,Provider,It is a type of meditation. It is a type of meditation but mindfulness is really about doing one thing at a time right. So I put in a lot in that one about being in your body in the space it's in right and starting to tune in to what's around you so that you're not just like up in your head not paying attention to what's really going on. Around right so and.
14144.0,Patient,I like the boat.
416.0,Provider,"You like the boats that's the other skill, so the skill that I love, one of the skills that I love to build into mindfulness is. is starting to have control over where we direct our thoughts. Right, so in that activity you're able to sit up. away from your thoughts and observe them as if you're separate from them sending some compassion and love, but not grabbing a hold of a thought and running with it. Right, so if one of the thoughts that goes by on your boat is oh my God I gotta worry about what's for dinner later, you don't have to grab Ahold of it and really work for you, you can stay back and go. To dinner vote."
14144.0,Patient,Right.
416.0,Provider,"And then, it helps you get to a place with a lot of practice, you can get to the place where you can really choose which thoughts you grab Ahold of. But it's really solid practice to. To get going on that."
14144.0,Patient,Very good.
416.0,Provider,"So there's some Apps out there, and some of them are free and that are wonderful for this."
14144.0,Patient,Okay.
416.0,Provider,And are you open to practicing some mindfulness. So um. I challenge you to five to 10 minutes a day.
14144.0,Patient,Okay that's a challenge.
416.0,Provider,"Okay. that's my challenge for you five to 10 minutes a day. we'll see if it has an effect on you, being able to be calm and more present. to feel more grounded in your decisions and to feel more emotionally regulated."
14144.0,Patient,"Okay, if I really love this it helps me to focus on one thing at a time, you know because I just I I i'll be washing the dishes and there's a million other things that i'm making a list in my mind about. I don't even stop and i'll go to my iPhone to notes and i'll start writing lists, because I don't want to forget all these thoughts and things that I need to do."
416.0,Provider,Do you ever. Do you ever find yourself feeling kind of clumsy.
14144.0,Patient,shy so in your head that you don't.
416.0,Provider,You don't know where your body.
14144.0,Patient,"And I hurt myself do because I get I actually do it clumsy so last week, I was doing that you know, I was thinking too much about what I needed to do as I was doing housework. And I was clumsy and I caused something to fall and hit the bridge of my nose and give me two black eyes and then people think my husband hits me but it doesn't i'm i'm hurting myself, you know I broke my collarbone I gave myself to black guys."
416.0,Provider,"So we we let me see if I can find an article, the article I think you know, for you, but. it's the difference between mindlessness and mindfulness right. Right like you're not really even present in your body when you're sort of mindless so when your attention is everywhere else and thinking about the future and right it feels very scattered and it feels like things happen to you, like you, aren't in control."
14144.0,Patient,Yes.
416.0,Provider,"So mindfulness is the opposite of that and. it's going to feel really hard at first probably. feel really awkward but it's critical that you practice it, because every time you do it you'll get a little bit better at it over time and. I guarantee you'll find that you are more present in your body."
14144.0,Patient,weight.
416.0,Provider,"So let me. Okay, I have let me see if I can. This is, this is the one I wanted to share with you. All right, i'm going to share this article with you. In the chat. And it would be great if you wanted to take a little time and read it it's not that long. So working on interpersonal effectiveness working on being able to speak up for your wants and needs in some healthy ways having some better conversations and then also working on mindfulness. there's some good things to work on for a bit. What else do you think you like sort of in a more urgent sense I mean I hear that there's definitely some grief in your life. right with your brother. who's supporting you through that grief."
14144.0,Patient,"um my I have a lot of family support I do on the only problem is that I have a lot of financial family support and a lot of it in helping my brothers in the hospital so money for hotels money for gas on, and I have a lot of on. A lot of support, like in without them being present so, in other words, nobody I should I don't want to say no, because that's not true. Very few people actually came to the hospital and assisted, you know supported me in that manner by supporting my brother. In the you know, in the President, being in the presence of em um so that was unfortunate so out of my nine brothers and sisters. One brother chain for about 30 minutes um and so that that didn't feel good um one brother would have been there, but he was not feeling well and he actually ended up having to get coven tested, so I feel like he had a path."
416.0,Provider,yeah.
14144.0,Patient,"He definitely still went out of his way, once he knew he was not going to didn't have koba he went out of his way to you know invite me to stay this home if I needed that, and you know, so I felt like I had real strong support from him. um my my sister who i'm very close to she made a choice to not come on. and be there and her choice was based on the fact that she has an alcoholic daughter living with her and she was in crisis. So I also understood that. But then I think about the rest of them and I get not angry, but upset."
416.0,Provider,yeah. Like a little hurt on his behalf.
14144.0,Patient,"Yes, yes, most definitely."
416.0,Provider,"yeah I can hear that for sure. yeah sorry I mean it's lovely that you have support through this I mean especially financial but also emotional. I think that's great i'm glad to hear that and that you guys are able to kind of pull together a little bit. Sad, I mean the situation there's sort of no way getting around the fact that it's just really sad."
14144.0,Patient,"it's all it is. And, and I know that a lot of. Of the family that's not there on it's because you know my brothers elements are from cirrhosis of the liver and they gave up on it, they. think not only gave up on him a long time ago they choose to not let that bring them to a place, they don't want to be, you know so. In a way, I have to have no choice but to understand and their spec that but. that's logically illogically I want them there i'm angry at them, I I answered the phone while my brother you're my brother who's ill was in surgery. And my one of my other seven brothers called see what was going on and I answered the phone very rudely you know, the first thing I said was are you on your way over here. And he said no, I have a life, and I said so do I, but I commend to be here, why can't you and he hung up on me. And then I thought to myself well, you had the right to hang up on me that was probably not a good way to deal with that and I call them back. So."
416.0,Provider,I mean these kinds of situations just bring out everybody's hurt you know. yeah and everybody reacts to it differently and then people get more hurt and finding some grace and all of this is it's tough in a big family.
14144.0,Patient,"Well, it is, and my son my youngest son lives there in San Jose and I was the mile away from him on in my hotel was a mile away from him. And in the last three times i've been in the area, which have been over the last like four months i've been there, a little more often than usual actually i've tried to visit with him. And he's always calling me for a favor and he's always calling me to talk in he even calls just to check up on me, but he doesn't make any time to see me. And, last night I lashed out at him because he said he would hang out with me at about 615 and when I called to tell him okay i'm coming to get you he said he was playing video games and could I give him an hour. And I said no i'm going to drive home tonight I can't give you an hour. I would like. You know, to see you and I don't have the time to give you an hour and he said Oh well, i'm sorry I can't just stop a game or i'll be penalized and I said typical Tyler and he said I don't appreciate that mom. And I said, well, I apologize I just missed you."
416.0,Provider,"I mean. I like the way that you said that last part, especially I apologize, but I miss you right so again it's like speaking up for your wants and needs. I miss you i'd like to see you more when when I asked you to be there, and you say you will be I need you to please do it."
14144.0,Patient,yeah.
416.0,Provider,Oh.
14144.0,Patient,it's a lot.
416.0,Provider,"it's a lot it's a lot, how are you how are you doing with like food and exercise and sleep and stuff like that."
14144.0,Patient,I feel that my sleep is improving. um I don't i'm not eating well at all just one the nine I need to put a grandson back in.
416.0,Provider,mm hmm.
14144.0,Patient,sweetheart grandma is busy okay. All right. um so i'm not eating well but i'm sleeping better.
416.0,Provider,What do you mean when you say you're not eating well.
14144.0,Patient,"um I don't eat well in general, so I don't crave breakfast and I have a hard time forcing myself to eat breakfast and on so I don't normally eat anything by mouth or anything other than liquids until about 7pm every day on 7am 7pm. Every day. And then, and then I, I have a real slow metabolism I don't eat much i'm very overweight. On, and so it was even worse, while I was out of town, because it was fast food on so that's what I mean."
416.0,Provider,"Okay, and have you talked with your doctor about this."
14144.0,Patient,"No, I haven't I don't think I have talked to my doctor about is um like if there's any medicine, he can give me to help me to lose weight on and he did prescribe something, but it wasn't affordable. On and so, but that's the only I haven't talked to him about my diet per se."
416.0,Provider,I mean that might be a good thing to bring up.
14144.0,Patient,an appointment with him.
416.0,Provider,"there's. there's a lot in the literature about the connection between mental health and food intake and what you're what you're consuming. Because a lot of your neurotransmitters actually your serotonin you know the things that we connect to depression, anxiety, those are actually produced in your gut most of them are. So what we eat, how we consume it definitely has an effect on our mental health."
14144.0,Patient,So we aware that.
416.0,Provider,"Most people aren't so yeah you're not alone some you may find that if there's like some. small changes that you can make around eating at least just more. Like the food that you do eat eating more fruits and vegetables, you know whole foods not processed foods and eating things are very few ingredients and the more you can pack that in you might see a big difference in your mental health."
14144.0,Patient,"I was talking to my sister a lot about that about exactly what you just said, less the eating things with less ingredients that are more wholesome. And so far, what I have done, and I would say the last month is I reduced the around the amount of meat that I eat and increase the amount of vegetables and. fruits, that I eat mainly vegetables. Okay, well, I have done that. But you know not so hot when I was you know. But I made an effort, like, I went to the cafeteria and I got I had on vegetable soup and green beans for dinner one night, so I made an effort."
416.0,Provider,"Good. Good yeah okay so um you know I think that's worth discussing with your doctor for sure, and you know again making just continuing to make the effort is big and see how that just kind of influences or doesn't your overall feelings of."
14144.0,Patient,healthiness well my.
416.0,Provider,Body feels good our brains feel good to say.
14144.0,Patient,"goodbye, oh no it's okay my sister's on very wholesome and are eating and has been for about 10 years now, and she tells me it's made huge difference for her mm hmm yeah."
416.0,Provider,Most people find it makes a big difference. Right yeah.
14144.0,Patient,So it's good.
416.0,Provider,little change. Right we're not talking about big changes right.
14144.0,Patient,"Right I buy I really am i'm actually astounded by the fact that it affects your mental health, I thought it was a physical thing. No."
416.0,Provider,"it's both there's there so intricately connected. But it's it's even more of a direct connection than we had thought for years, because a lot of your serotonin is produced in your gut."
14144.0,Patient,"I have a couple of questions for you. yeah one of them is. Sharon has been trying to have a prescription filled from Nicole to until it, which is for depression. i've not been on an antidepressant for a few months now um I was taking something called dental flaxen flexing and I stopped taking it for a couple of reasons. And the chantel X I haven't taken because of the problem with the insurance and getting it filled we're work sharon's trying to work on that, but she's been working on it, since August so. I don't know what's going to happen there it's October on and I don't even know if I want to restart an antidepressant right now, because I feel like ever since i've been working with you. And I know we haven't had a lot of appointments, but I feel there's been a significant difference and how I felt before and how I feel now. So i'm kind of wondering, you know. i'm kind of leaning towards not doing it, but then I don't want to hurt myself by being too depressed."
416.0,Provider,"You know I mean I I feel like this is a great conversation for you to have a Sharon but i'm willing to have it with you. Okay. So you have choices right it's your body it's your choice, how you want to proceed, I definitely have patients that I work with WHO. have said that they want to give it a full try without other meds first and see if that they're being whatever they're on already and makes a difference. And before they add anything else, and you know, unless things are really critical like if they're suicidal or something and I support that approach, I think that it's a very individual decision, and so it, it would be fine with me."
14144.0,Patient,You said.
416.0,Provider,"yeah yeah and then, but you know you may find after a while that you hit a plateau and you're not quite better enough, and you want to proceed with meds so it's really up to you, unless you're in crisis and absolutely need medication nobody's going to force it on you."
14144.0,Patient,"Okay, thank you."
416.0,Provider,yeah so go with your heart go with your gut.
14144.0,Patient,Okay.
416.0,Provider,"Okay, and but communicate that with Sharon."
14144.0,Patient,If you can't no I will.
416.0,Provider,"Yes, okay that that's your choice and what was your question."
14144.0,Patient,Well there's where my memory hasn't improved enough yet I forgot the other questions i'm sorry.
416.0,Provider,"that's all. Right all right hold on i'm gonna get off the screen, where I can see you and i'm going to look at our schedules to see when your scheduled backs. Are you that you are. Make sure that we have our next appointments all set."
14144.0,Patient,Okay.
