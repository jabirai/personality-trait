If you don't mind just listening and answering my questions, but if you could sit up, so I could see your whole face that's good. Until your your screen down. Thank you. Okay, so do you ever feel like the TV has special messages. or the people can read your mind. Yes, okay. So that's why they call it skis or effective. Okay, I don't know what to tell you, I guess, we would go with a schism affective disorder and if he wants I can continue his depakote. And abilify 30 i'm not going to refill the xanax he's been off of it nine days I will give him some valium. To get him off at five milligrams in the am. And if we get back on we get back on. I didn't ask him about suicide, because I, he we lost him here, maybe this is him. Okay, put your video on Giovanni. Good okay you got. super. and use any drugs or alcohol. Giovanni. So I would just complete the hmp with the questionnaire. That he has. And he does have all those psychotic symptoms, that I have in the M mental status exam. He says he has one son one daughter I don't know who he lives with there was construction being done. and Then he said he had a physical altercation last 12 months. And then he's a full time student that's interesting and he has social security. retirement. Okay. and his pH Q nine indicates to us pretty depressed and jd seven that he's pretty anxious so excuse affective disorder. I don't know about suicide I haven't been able to assess that. I will start them on valium he has a curious report indicating that he's getting out prevalent pretty frequently and oxy code on and I don't know what the pain is about. So i'm going to enter the medications he says he's on I don't know if they. need refilling or not, as a MED list. So what you can piece together from the history and from what we said I guess is what will will have in the. In the intake and maybe they can schedule another one, so we can finish it. But the diagnosis so affective disorder and then I listed those meds as in the MED list. symptoms or depression sleep of four hours and had done a panic anxiety phobia your ability angle and sexual trauma. Okay, thank you bye."
