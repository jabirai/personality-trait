298.0,Provider,"Okay, and how's that working for you."
15149.0,Patient,"Well that's okay um I think. I think it might take a little time to really. work its way in my system, because I think those antidepressants take a little while I was on. I mean i'm definitely doing better so you know home and. i'm a. While back and Edit presence, they they bumped me up to 200 milligrams pretty quickly. It was when I went into the hospital, I was on. I started with 25 milligrams and then the doctor that saw me in the er. put me on 50. With the intention of. bumping it up higher over time, but. When I got to last and seen us they they pump me up to 200 within within like a week's time. So that was a little quick, but you know."

298.0,Provider,Okay wonderful. Just circumstances that got you admitted.
15149.0,Patient,"Well, I was having. Basically, so I got the coven vaccine, the first shot. So I think it was. This fall."
298.0,Provider,Okay.
15149.0,Patient,"Go ahead, you know, I was doing pretty well, I was doing pretty well around that time I just for months, I was going back and forth, whether or not gets a shot, I can. be kind of obsessive like that, as far as we over researching things before I make decisions and this one was a big one for me, because I, you know I heard a lot of. You know it's shot is new and i've gotten a lot of misinformation from like family member my sister and some other people and. just trying to decide what the best thing to do is kind of a research there. In the end, since. I I was recently. hired. As a park ranger so I figured you know i'm going to be working with the public, so. I should probably probably do this i'm always a little fearful i'm going to give somebody else coated like if I don't. I don't know I have it, or something so since I was going to be around a lot of people I just went did it. So after that I just started getting. Like I couldn't sleep that first night I was getting a lot of like weird sensations in my body and like this, like burning. tingling feeling like in my neck back my head. sensations like, in my eyes and I also had some of the expected side effects, like the. fatigue and body aches and stuff but there was just a lot of things that were. Just freaking out, and I think I just the insomnia, continued from that I was sometimes able to get some sleep if I took it out of them, but then. I wasn't taking it every day because I didn't want to be depended on it, but then my doctor recommended I take it every day, just to get my sleep back so there was many there are there are many days with insomnia, which i'm. Like last several weeks. And i'm actually still dealing with it, to a certain extent, but. But uh but with that came a lot of panic attacks. Like I was just getting these horrible panic attacks about it that I would just have to sit down and try to breathe slowly until they went away. And then, sometimes. It came to a point where they just they were coming more frequently. and I don't know it just kind of got where. we're sitting. I ended up. going to the er several times, which is. Probably not good. Because I was. With my anxiety me I was worried, I was having a stroke. And there are reasons for that I. There is, there is one time I had like my blood pressure was really high so. I guess I wasn't really realizing the blood pressure, like fluctuates like that, but. But at one point I was. My blood pressure was measured by the. The ambulance staff emt. They brought me and for that reason alone, because my blood pressure, reading was pretty high. And that was worried, I was having. Something. Anyway, I guess, I just. yeah I was just having a lot of anxiety things like that a lot of panic attacks so. I ended up going to the. ended up talking to a psychiatrist. She yeah she ended up holding me for the. For the 72 hour whole thing."
298.0,Provider,Are you having any suicidal or. homicidal thoughts. Okay. and When was the last time you did. Could you hear me. I really can't hear you.
15149.0,Patient,"yeah. Oh sorry, can you hear me."
298.0,Provider,yeah I can hear you.
15149.0,Patient,can hear me.
298.0,Provider,I can hear you. Very delayed.
15149.0,Patient,Oh sorry.
298.0,Provider,Go ahead.
15149.0,Patient,"No, I mean I just felt like. You know just get my life back together, you know I get I get to press times I don't I don't have any plan to do. Okay."
298.0,Provider,What is your living situation.
15149.0,Patient,"I live alone, I have a studio apartment."
298.0,Provider,"Okay, what are your stressors in life."
15149.0,Patient,"um. Well i'm starting this new job i'm supposed to start training tomorrow i'm. A little stressed about that yeah because i've. You know i've lost a lot of sleep it's been going on for about a month I think it's getting better now. I was able to get some decent sleep, the other night. But I just worry a little bit starting a new job. kind of being in this. still dealing with the samia thing. But I think it's getting better and if I make if I make better choices with not drinking too late. what's I take once I started once I start working that'll probably make things a little better. Okay, but a little worried about that. I was worried. I was worried that possibly had coven. Recently, after I got out of the Program."
298.0,Provider,I just.
15149.0,Patient,"I was just feeling, since some symptoms like it mainly at night, like, I was getting a cough at night and. Had a little bit of stuffy nose cold chills like cold sweats. And I ended up I ended up talking to a nurse at the nurse advice line about that because I was wondering if I should go into this doctor's appointment that I had on Friday. and We talked for a little while but I told her I had done a couple of covert tests. And they both came back negative. But she said. hi don't normally I could probably just see if the symptoms got worse if they didn't I would be okay, just to do you know go about my normal life, but she said, since there was someone last seen us there was a guy that started he started coughing. last couple of years I was there, like maybe he was coming down coming down with something so. I told her about that too, but there's no way I know if he was ever tested or. Or what the test result was if he was tested. So I told her, I told her about that, I guess, because of that she was. kind of treating that as a possible exposure because I just don't really know if this guy was. If it was just cough or if he had coven. So anyway, I started I started worrying about that a lot, because I. I want to start the training, this week, a new job. and They were already waiting for me when I was in when I was in last Siemens. My my brother emailed them to let him know I wasn't feeling well. So if I call and tell now that Oh, I need to wait another week. I feel it might ruin the opportunity. So I ended up making an appointment with a with a doctor about it because. that's that's something that the nurse said she's like well you know follow up with your doctor and see what they say. So I told this doctor was what was going on, through telehealth on on Saturday. he's not my regular doctor, he was just he's the per diem doctor they had available that day."
298.0,Provider,uh huh.
15149.0,Patient,"I told I told him what was going on and. He said it sounded mostly like anxiety. I probably did get into as much detail as I did with them there but. But he said it sounds like anxiety, you know, sometimes that can cause the things I described and. Like the recent blood work I did was pretty good."
298.0,Provider,Okay.
15149.0,Patient,couple weeks ago I guess. He said it's probably it's probably fine. So I don't know i'm just i'm telling you all this i'm just trying to give you an idea like what. The things that worry me like I mean it's democrats this that i'm gonna. Like in fact somebody with covert or something. So.
298.0,Provider,Okay.
15149.0,Patient,it's like a it's a like an OCD worry.
298.0,Provider,"Okay, what is your SIP are who is your support system."
15149.0,Patient,"My friends and family that's been helping me so much. My family, especially they've been calling me every day."
298.0,Provider,Oh.
15149.0,Patient,My my brother's. i've been trying to reach out to. Some more friends also.
298.0,Provider,Okay.
15149.0,Patient,"My good friend of mine is just coming back from Florida he's been out there, few weeks, so I want to try to. Try to connect with them, you know this week, sometimes. it's just better for me like. As long as I just did a. Automatic when I get up I just feel a lot. More. I feel a bit depressed. Like. Things that i'm scared of happening. But as soon as I get up I automatically feel a little better, I get up to take a shower and spend some time outside and. Also, trying to do you know productive thing. Like paying bills and. catching up on some of the stuff that lag behind, while I was in the facility over. stuff like that. I definitely. Good or. Camille. she's my friend we're still friends. she's she's. Yes, talk to the my brothers almost every day. Every day for a while, but now it's. Maybe every other day or so."
298.0,Provider,Would you like. To kind of share. And what about the coveted fear.
15149.0,Patient,"I said it's just. it's something that's on my mind, a lot that. I worry that. I guess, especially getting out of the facility, because there was a lot of people in a tight space. And we didn't really go outside that much so it's just i'm. Just just one of the things that I have anxiety about possibly having covered and. Right. Spread spread it to people."
298.0,Provider,you're not. you're not alone.
15149.0,Patient,Oh thanks. I know it's a. it's been a very trying time for a lot of people. That probably already had excited to begin with.
298.0,Provider,Right.
15149.0,Patient,"And then, it just just ramped it up that much more."
298.0,Provider,Right. Like a referral to a psychiatrist within your network of your insurance or would you like to join a mental health program like ours that does group therapy and. You don't have to see an individual counseling or myself who prescribes medications. The group therapy is done once a week for one hour and. The individual therapist is done like once every three months because you have an outside therapist you do not need to sign up with me all your insurance wanted you to do was meet with a provider like myself. and give give you a refill if you need a refill. or give you. or give you. places that you can call for getting a psychiatrist.
15149.0,Patient,"that'd be great yeah and I could I could make the decision about. The group therapy, a little bit later."
298.0,Provider,"yeah sure you can you can, would you like me to give you a refill right now and referrals or would you want just referrals."
15149.0,Patient,"Well, I have. I have this know last for about a month. i'm just a little worried about. Being I mean i've taken any depressants before i've. i've had therapy with OCD before and stuff. So I kind of know usually. You know, it takes a little longer to move up to this. This. This amount of 200 milligrams. um. I don't know, I would like to I guess. yeah just maybe maybe talk to somebody and see if that's definitely the right dose. i'm definitely taking it until I. Okay, good good another. You know until i'm seeing somebody that can."
298.0,Provider,help me manage it. I am just me for now i'll take.
15149.0,Patient,"i'm gonna. Take the 200 milligrams but. I would just like to management manager, to see if I really you know manage it with a psychiatrist to see if I really need. To take much because there yeah there has been some side effects."
298.0,Provider,"Yes, of course, okay well, you are free to go, unless you have any questions, for me, you can also check your email in the next day or two, and we will send over a list of psychiatrists in your insurance."
15149.0,Patient,Okay um. yeah that'll be great and where do I inquire about the therapy.
