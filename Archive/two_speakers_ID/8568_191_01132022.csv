191.0,Provider,"So your depression score screening score was a 16 and that 16 is moderately severe depression, how do you feel about that score."
8568.0,Patient,"I agree with it, I kind of figured it was going to go up a little bit because it just with everything does feel like it's building up on me and. You know I do start to see a light at the end of the tunnel and then, of course I get knocked back a little I don't let it get to me too bad, but it's hard to get myself like out of that. And the whole looking down on things, and you know i'm trying to get myself out of it to where I try to pull myself out, and you know I try to think of other things, but of course it's not always easy to do and it's a struggle and. I begin frustrated more lately and."
191.0,Provider,Okay.
8568.0,Patient,"I don't know if it's just you know, like with everything going on and stuff and then mom and. Your dad your dad or for your."
191.0,Provider,"mom to. Now Okay, and so some of the things i've captured from listening to you, your caregiver for your mom she's ailing. You lost her daughter, less than a year ago, still some grief and you've been dealing with that. In terms of."
8568.0,Patient,"My dad you know, almost two years ago now to."
191.0,Provider,"So back to back. And you know. The little interest of pleasure and doing things nearly every day feeling down and depressed or hopeless nearly every day feeling tired of having little energy nearly every day, but no suicidal thoughts or plans for what you share here. No okay any. thoughts on on yourself or anyone else. No seeing or hearing anything that's not there. No Okay, did you find that medication."
8568.0,Patient,"For your she had that yeah she said, the first thing that she took was zoloft. No she is she said it worked for a little while, but then she ended up getting switched over to something else that that's what she takes down, I cannot think of what it is, oh my God."
191.0,Provider,yeah was it select so cymbalta effexor. paxil Prozac. selects was a very popular wants to tell a program. Okay.
8568.0,Patient,"You know what you got it mixed up, it was she took the Prozac and then went to the zoloft."
191.0,Provider,"Okay, so. Because all off is a popular wants and that's. A very good one, to start with, because a lot of. People can tolerate it okay so let's look at your get seven so you get seven as a score nine it's looking at anxiety, so that that puts you at least like a moderate anxiety, how do you feel about that."
8568.0,Patient,Oh yeah. i'm. ready to hire honestly.
191.0,Provider,"Okay okay katie, and so what causes your anxiety, or do you feel like you have a generalized anxiety where you're anxious in multiple situations."
8568.0,Patient,"yeah say it's not just like one turn thing it's multiple said, you know it. It would depend on the situation, but a lot of situations, just like having to make a phone call to like even before I get on with you, I i've told you before like even before I get on with you, even though I know i'm not in trouble and i'm not doing it."
191.0,Provider,"Right, you know."
8568.0,Patient,"Whatever I start to get you know the anxiety and my stomach's turn in, and you know I start, you know sweat and my hand sweat I do get a little shaky night like to like tremors or anything but I do get a little shaky and. I do pace, a little bit and they get that nervous feeling like you're going into the principal's office and you're about to get into trouble. it's, the only way that I can really describe of you know how how it starts to feel. that's how it starts."
191.0,Provider,"Okay, so i'm going to look here, so I know we've gone over pH Q nines and get seven so we're document that this is not the first one we've gone over. As I recall, we've done some other ones so let's document that we've gone over pH Q nine and get sevens today and prior so it looks like you have a major depression disorder, it looks like it's about a moderate severe. Do you agree with that and how long have you been dealing with depression."
8568.0,Patient,I think i've been dealing with it for a while I don't think it's.
191.0,Provider,"A year or two, or at least one."
8568.0,Patient,"way to say yeah definitely more than that i'd say it. Probably since my dad died back in 2000 early. After that I think the depression kicked in a little bit it wasn't like too bad to where it wasn't like really affecting my life really bad, I guess, I was still able to participate, I was still working I was still doing all that. And then. When everything started going on with my mom you know seven months after my dad died, is when everything started with mom and that kind of kicked it into and. But then it also kind of distracted me, at the same time, but when I was alone, it would like really you know because I wasn't alone, a lot because everybody was around. And then, when everything just kind of started being on me and everybody was you know kind of this, you know dispersion and everybody was going back to their normal lives and things like that which I expected. You know I think that's when it really started kicking in and I just felt more and more alone so it's not really kicked in but obviously are really kicked in after my daughter passed but i'd say since 2019 I think i've been dealing with it and it's just forgotten, you know with okay."
191.0,Provider,So over two years it sounds like at least.
8568.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
191.0,Provider,"Alright, so i'm trying to get this to. trying to get this to come on computer."
8568.0,Patient,If it blows a little bit if the wind is a little too strong around here are starts freezing and messing up all the time.
191.0,Provider,"Okay, it is start at us all right, then. Major depression you sort of return. Okay, major depression disorder record a seat at least a moderate or moderate severe. idea and then generalized anxiety disorder. i'm going to go with let me go ahead and share with you about this oh wow okay. So couple of things we're going to start dissolve i'm going to start very low dose the lowest dose 25 milligrams a day. Okay, could take anywhere from four to six weeks i've had patients say that they noticed improvement after. Two weeks once you're on the medication for several weeks, you will it's best that you not stop it abruptly, or you could feel worse so. You slowly if you get to the point where we need to take you down a dose will do it very slowly okay event the shocker flu like symptoms, that you can develop without it Okay, for some people, it can be very severe they could get very unstable head spinning alright. The Max dose zoloft that I usually use on a patient is about 200 milligrams a day you do want to watch to see if it makes you feel worse better or the same I like for people to journal whenever they're taking their medications okay there's a lot."
8568.0,Patient,Of journaling.
191.0,Provider,"Great so notice how it affects you please observe if you have any any upset stomach and headaches lightheaded dizziness does that affect the way you move or shake. I tell patients, when you start this medicine, for the first time i'm not had people say that they feel energized when I take the law, but you may want to take it in the afternoon, so if it makes you tired it's close enough to the bed time that you go to sleep. So if it causes you to feel tired. taken an evening so that in and then before you go to sleep, if you feel a little bit more energized take it in the morning because i've had people feel different ways on it okay. Please notice how it affects you mentally mood seeing or hearing anything shakes tremors any emotions in your body does you have more dryness in your mouth okay. One of the reasons I start with a very low dose so if there's any negative side effects if you start with a low dose and guess what. is usually more tolerable when you stop it okay. Okay, so the zoloft the other. name for the drug is circling Okay, and then i'll follow you and so so surliness other name for."
8568.0,Patient,So take that as a as a.
191.0,Provider,"As a hmm so take one tap by mouth daily and i'll start you off with a number 30 and I know I see you in groups on a regular basis, and so you just let me know how you feel okay."
