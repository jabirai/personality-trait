15228.0,Patient,"I. met someone who told me about right hearts, I thought I would try it out. After being kind of frustrated with a variety of attempts to seek a diagnosis i'm getting distracted anyway. But in my general life time it's because I passed my qualifying exams in my PhD program and i'm now like standing in front of writing my dissertation. And it was just becoming clearer and clearer that. I was just having trouble dealing with all of the details and managing my time and getting overwhelmed by different priorities. Which made me think Okay, I need to do something yeah."
252.0,Provider,So is it.
15228.0,Patient,I mean. I have anxiety about the fact that I have trouble doing the things that are asked of me. i'm realizing that a lot of my anxiety is not actually anxiety it's just overthinking. yeah that's what I would say.

15228.0,Patient,"I have. been. In the past i'm just like eating like way past where. I never bombed it or do anything like that, I would just eat so much that it would feel uncomfortable I guess that's what I would call it, I was like aware that I was eating to like feel like, for my feelings."
252.0,Provider,"Okay, and is it something that you continually do or you've just noticed that you used to do it or you've done it in the past."
15228.0,Patient,"I used to do it, I do not do that anymore, I mean. i'm not gonna say I never like to eat some ice cream but. yeah it's not something I struggle with now."

15228.0,Patient,No that's fine.
252.0,Provider,"Alright The next question is about the family, you grew up in. And what it wants, or what it needs is to just kind of be me a picture of what it was like growing up in your home with your family. Like. How many siblings did you have, or do you have did your parents stay together the divorce, did they have any issues with mental health. or substance abuse just kind of paint me a picture of what it was like."
15228.0,Patient,"yeah um. yeah I mean I think both of my parents have undiagnosed ADHD. My. they're divorced, they divorced, when I was or they separated, when I was like 10 um. But yeah I don't think things were like my I have one younger brother like I only have one sibling he was born when I was two and a half and I don't I think pretty much things went downhill like from there. Because, at the same time, my dad had started a restaurant. Without having the capability of like running. A business. and So. My mom was totally overwhelmed because of the situation where she didn't help and also like has ADHD anyway so. yeah I think that. My early childhood was. Quite quite apparent I guess the first two and a half years might have been actually pretty nice i'm fine, although I seem to already have been very overactive but. Then you know it was just really hard during the period where my parents marriage was falling apart my brother had some health problems physical health problems. And then my dad like was you know working at the restaurant all the time and then unemployed, once he, like went bankrupt through the restaurant. and There were just like financial difficulties. yeah I don't know my parents. are both very loving toward me and toward my brother. they're very disorganized they don't set limits, they don't. Because they can't really do that for themselves, either. And then both my brother, and I think became. Like really like Okay, well, we have to be the ones who are like overachievers. For that reason. yeah. Although not on chores. Just at school. yeah. yeah I don't know it did that. Yes, that was pretty bad okay. At what I mean yeah so yeah financial difficulties said, my dad. is probably is an alcoholic, although he doesn't identify as such a lot. yeah."
252.0,Provider,UK.
15228.0,Patient,"And my mom has been an Allen on, and I have. Sometimes not down on."
252.0,Provider,For you dad.
15228.0,Patient,"yeah, although not anymore, because. I just don't have. To get it stopped feeling so necessary once I have like so much distance from him. And were like my well being was not dependent on. him him yeah."
252.0,Provider,"um okay so tell me about your education experience. Were you bullied in school at all, did you. Yes, struggle at all."
15228.0,Patient,"I always struggled with. As a child, I always struggled with like social things. it's not entirely clear why. I mean. yeah well. So I was bullied basically. apart, I was very verbal as a child, and then, when I learned to read, I immediately started reading like whole books and I was just like devour them and then I was in second grade, and they were like doing this, these phonics exercises and I was going out of my mind, you know. I was so bored like I was like i'm gonna. tear my hair out and then my mom like advocated for me to get pushed up A grade. So I I skipped A grade, although I had been old for my grade, and then I became young. But like I was born on October 1 so it's like I just made that cut off. But the same time she like started applying for private schools like it took all of these tests and I end up getting a scholarship, and so I moved to this other school. And there again I really. had difficulty with. This was this one girl really just like, believe me, like, I remember she wrote like a note that was like go back to where you know go back to your old school or something like that. And also, there was this other situation where the kids like made up. A. Like nate like a fake name to talk about me as if they were talking about a TV show or something like that. which I then learned I don't remember when. Anyway, so it's pretty it's pretty bad and it and I stayed at that school and they were all the same people, the entire time. But, like in high school. middle school spill hard, but then high school was like. Actually kind of better I mean there was like more bullying in middle school that I then was just like. Fuck you like i'm not going to interact with you at all anymore, even though before I had always been like. I don't know still whatever. not making a break like that I guess and then. yeah but then I became really obsessed with like getting into a you know, like Harvard or something, and also because I read all of this information about. Like like the things that you should do and, like all of this, also about colleges and the cost of colleges and how, if you go to like all of us like really elite schools have this financial aid, which means that they like pay for you know. You so, then I. was just like obsessed with that. Like really just thought about it, most of the time. And then I in junior year I like hit a wall, where I was like just not able to like manage everything. And that was when I actually went to a psychiatrist and she diagnosed me with anxiety and she said, you have ADHD and your dad has ADHD but. She didn't like I don't know if she wrote it down like I don't know like I don't know if there was really a formal diagnosis, she just said that, and then we were like. Atlanta i'd always had like straight a's and, like all of this stuff so they were like I don't know. So we just ignored it and I went on ssri rise. And I dropped ap us history which I could not, I could not read the textbook like. Well, I could read it, but I couldn't. Like the idea that I needed to read the amount that they wanted me to be reading it was just so I was like I can't I don't want to do this, I can't do it anyway. yeah. Do you want me to go on to the rest of my i've been in school, for a long time because i'm a program."
252.0,Provider,yeah definitely.
15228.0,Patient,"So then, in college. I think now that I think about it. I thought oh i'm gonna get to college and I can like experience life and like I don't have to be so serious about school and all of that stuff. But then I actually found that there was no really way for me to have a middle between. Taking it all like this, like perfectionist stick like. It was difficult for me to pay attention at all or motivate me to do anything except from that like perfectionist stick way of proceeding um. And I it it's perfection stick it's also really idealistic like it's not just like Oh, it has to be perfect it's also like. It has to mean something it has to be like really, what I want to say it has to you know what I mean like. it's not. it's not just felt like flagellating it's also yeah anyway. So. You know it sort of was fine ish the first year, but I was like I just kept struggling with like not really knowing what I wanted what I wanted to do like how to proceed in that sense also I really like writing like a. Creative writing but it wasn't really you know. i'd always felt too scary to like try to really pursue that anyway so. Finally, again like after the third year I got like pretty depressed because I just kept going, but I had no idea what I was doing and I would every semester i'd be like Oh, this is what i'm doing and then i'd be like no that's not really what i'm doing, and then I took a year off. And went to Austria, which is where my dad is from and I had been learning German, and so I became fluent in German, while I was there. And it was. It was really great. To like experience life be less stressed out and just kind of like you know not have so much pressure on myself but. But I also kind of got bored like like I still wanted to be doing projects and I didn't know how to really. yeah. Do like figure out where how to. How to guide my attention, basically, or like into a project or something like that. i'm like i'm just kind of like dissipate. And then. And then I like so after that year I was actually really excited to go back to school and I was like okay I wanna do German studies. And then I did that and I wrote a really good senior thesis always in my same style where I just like read stuff and then sometime at the end it like comes together like I read all the random shit and I have no idea what i'm doing, and then I have to like funnel it. Which is always very intense at the end and it's like very exhausting because basically like a switch goes on, and then I can't really sleep through the night. Because I wake up and like go we're doing this. Right it's not exactly fear like it's not actually exactly fear it's just you're doing this thing. And there's no turning like you can't turn it off. Until the thing is."
252.0,Provider,done mm hmm.
15228.0,Patient,"And that is just you know frustrating and difficult because, like I literally like can't relax or. Okay, so then. Then I took time off to be a translator in Vienna for two years. Well, again, it was like this one year, where I was like oh i'm just translating I don't have to do anything, in particular, but then I felt frustrated again with nothing coming to anything. And then, and then I was a column in apply to Grad school and then it was like okay Mike 100% of my life is Grad school that's like everything that i'm I can only think about that. yeah and then, and then I got into Grad school and I came and. You know it's just increasingly been this feeling of like wow i'm like so stimulated and interested. You know, obviously this question of what is my contribution, like how do I narrow that. um. But it's also. You know the first year I was just taking seminars and the next year I was taking seminars and teaching so running a class that was extremely extremely difficult because. Like. Just going between checking things off and actually being able to sit down and like read something or think about something. feels like impossible basically for me like. yeah I don't know it's like. Two different States of being. yeah that aren't. yeah I can't really go from one to the other um. Then, and so i've just been like flying by the seat of my pants like doing all the work at the end of the Semester and I was like. I know I guess my entire life i've just the like maybe sometime this will change like i'll figure something out which it has literally always been like that how how what how did it change um. I mean. Like the one thing that ended up happening is that. I realized that I, I can like sometimes have been through periods, where it's like I can't answer emails or I can't schedule, something I can't do that I can't do that it's just so difficult to switch between. He doing that and actually paying attention and I don't really like how I am when i'm in that i'm. Doing mode. I don't know i'm i'm not sure about that, but. Especially now that i've been on medication like i'm not sure how that has changed. or not, but. In any case, um. yeah and then I just. I got really depressed like after I took my qualifying exams. Although it was like in the depth of the pandemic and it just was like really a lot of things at once. But then I kind of came out of it and also I wasn't teaching. It was doing all this. And it felt really good like I was like I felt like I was. kind of getting to. To do the thinking that I wanted to do like I wasn't just like doing nothing at all, although I did have trouble figuring out what the thing was that I was doing and how to get from this incredibly generative thinking to. What is this like what where is this going. And then. yeah I felt like I didn't want to come back to California, but then a fellowship that I had applied for fell through and. Like I was hoping to be indiana actually and I. was like Okay, well, I guess i'll have to teach and I was like excited because I would teach this. course. On writing like for freshman I was like oh it's a content course instead of just teaching German. Because the German somehow I I could get along with it because they gave us the syllabus like they gave us the syllabus. That didn't mean that you really knew all of the stuff that you had to do, or that it was all there, but there was just this like framework. That I could then shift and then with discourse, it was like I have to completely come up with a whole schedule and keep us on track. And that was the thing that. With and, rather than giving us like models, or something like that instead I I was just barraged with a million different. worksheets that people did for random classes, a million different syllabus that all look different from each other, where you also don't when you see a syllabus you don't really know also what it really means like it's just like. Like if, like if I came into psychosocial evaluation like that might be on the syllabus and i'd be like what is that I don't know what it is in advance. And then, like my Professor gave us like a 50 page handout of like information about it different workshops, you should do, but no, you know all of the logistics all of the structuring that information was left to me, and I think. I think like I was like really traumatized by this like it was just like. overload totally overload. and Then I was like they kept filling out these evaluations for bright heart, where it was like do you feel hopeless do you feel like you can't sleep and i'm like yeah like but. I with this is it's just. i'm I could tell it was falling back into a huge depression, because I was completely overwhelmed. But. I don't know there's a reason why, like it's like I but I kept struggling with the desire to just like escape this situation entirely. And like oh I can't do this I need to just do a different job like I and and I don't even think that's entirely wrong, but it still didn't help me with like what do I do right now. yeah because I can't like. Leave the situation um. And then. yeah I mean that's what i've been struggling with i'm still kind of struggling with that overall of like. Even though, and I didn't mention this, but i've been in a DDT program since February, so I actually have like. not bad week like mental health resources like. yeah. But I was also frustrated because I kept feeling like I kept talking about what was going on with me and they were like it's anxiety just do opposite action and i'm like. And now i'm like Oh, I have a fucking neurological condition and they just kept being like why don't why don't you do the skills and i'm like I want to do the skills, but like. there's I don't know, it was very frustrating to be confronted with these people who really didn't seem like they understood what I was actually going through."
252.0,Provider,"I understand that very much. You know, when I don't understand it does get frustrating, you know. yeah um okay any questions for me."
15228.0,Patient,um. I don't what questions like about what like about. Her you would you be my. Like you might therapist for add or like.
252.0,Provider,"Let me look okay. Sure, let me see who they got. do give me one second I just got to get through this and they don't have you assigned yet. or therapist, but you have Mary and Mary always likes. The patients that she's working with she tries to get them. Okay, to me."
15228.0,Patient,to you.
252.0,Provider,"yeah yeah because we Mary and I really work well together, you know and. And ADHD you know I, in my opinion, the more that you know about it, the better off, you know you can manage it, I do know that. Right, I do know that impulsivity is an issue with it compulsion, you know as a compulsive. issue that you've got to learn how to manage and I do know that medication helps. You know, helps you kind of regulate. A little bit calm down being able to focus. So um what I know is no questions. are too too little or too big so as a if you have them. and We can teach how to learn how to manage these it that comes with it. manage. The frustration that comes with it. And so, these are the kind of areas that we will definitely pinpoint. And we will see who they assign you to as far as a therapist."
15228.0,Patient,mm hmm okay yeah. Right.
252.0,Provider,So.
15228.0,Patient,"Well, one thing you know I, I will say that the that group things iot group. kind of stressed me out i'm. Not reading the text that the text is interesting. it's just like. I don't know."
252.0,Provider,So many people.
15228.0,Patient,"was a lot of people like with differing like. i'm going to know it began with this really intense. Like person having a panic attack and. I don't know I just feel a little concerned that. I mean, I can go there to like talk about medication and stuff like that, but. I felt I felt frustrated to have to be there, like I especially because the DDT does a lot of this like anxiety and like like those kind of learning. My guess i'm curious about my options in terms of that."
252.0,Provider,"And that would be something to really discuss with Mary. Because I. married and I do my gosh 12123455 groups and one of them is specifically for substance abuse and with substance abuse comes a lot of other things. And the other three I we have three of them that were working out of that same book learning how to cope with anxiety. yeah we just started a new group at six o'clock on Tuesdays that really addresses Depression and anxiety, how do we find joy and be happy. You know what does that really look like and it's through the material that we're using is through a Arthur by the name of David burns. And so far it's you know it's pretty amazing but we're just barely getting I mean it's a brand spanking new group Mary has other groups with other therapists that you can definitely ask her about. But I would. Say with her be be open with her. You know. Because that's how you get what you need right."
15228.0,Patient,"I don't know if I get appointments with her alone, no, I guess, I can just read her I don't know on."
252.0,Provider,making appointments through the vc.
15228.0,Patient,"Oh Okay, I say all right okay yeah cuz she just said. Just, I guess, this is just the medication management part. Yes, Lee okay."
252.0,Provider,"Okay, so go to the vc asked to schedule an appointment with Mary. Okay, and discuss it with her."
15228.0,Patient,sure.
252.0,Provider,"and see what your options are so that you can you know, make sure that you're getting what you need you know it's important."
15228.0,Patient,"yeah, of course. yeah I don't. What do you normally do, and I also don't know what our appointment is over, I guess you will tell me."
252.0,Provider,We are ending right now.
15228.0,Patient,Okay alright that's fine.
252.0,Provider,I have somebody.
15228.0,Patient,To go.
252.0,Provider,"So what are our appointment was just getting your bio psychosocial done right and that's taking a look at all these areas, that all those questions I asked you. was taking a look at all these areas of your life. And that's really what it is. and any questions I would answer you know any questions that you have guide you and direct you in the right direction. And so I am telling you, the best thing to do is talk to Mary make an appointment with her asked her what your options are. and follow the guidelines of her."
15228.0,Patient,"That sounds good yeah I mean. yeah I will I just, I just wanted to get some clarity about like also am I actually participating in the group or am I just writing to her like i'm just not totally clear on."
252.0,Provider,"How that group Okay, so in the group, sometimes it turns into. what's called the process group somebody sometimes somebody is really struggling with something. And the group will go along and. add their part and support that person, which then turns into other. Things coming out so sometimes the group turns into that where everybody is is discussing what's going on and we're finding solutions for their issues. Other times it is reading out of the book and finding ways that we can deal with and manage anxiety really taking a look at what the text is teaching us, you know about it. And sometimes there's exercises to do in it, and sometimes there's not so Mary said that the book that we are in, is the gold standard for treatment for anxiety and so that's why she thinks is vitally important that we learn these these skills."
15228.0,Patient,"I mean, I was really interested in the stuff that I mean I tend to be This tends to be the thing that I do i'm like Oh, this is fascinating so um I don't want to take up more of your time but yeah I really appreciate. Your advice on that i'll talk to her."
252.0,Provider,"Okay, good good good, and I hope to see in group."
15228.0,Patient,"Yes, yeah i'll see about when you know. I definitely she told me to come at least once a month, so we'll just see."
