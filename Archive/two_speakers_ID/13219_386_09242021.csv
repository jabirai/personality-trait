13219.0,Patient,So you're saying i'll have to go to group on Monday.
386.0,Provider,"There is a Monday care group, as I was saying before, and that would get you able, if you go to back care group, then I would be able to just send in another bridge for another four day supply for you at that, at that time that you go to care group."
13219.0,Patient,Only need a seven day squad.
386.0,Provider,"Right, but I can only prescribe i'm only authorized with the recommendation that you go to care group i'm only able to do for day increments. Because right now, your prescriptions been reading. The recommendation for your prescription is two days so without that care group I would only be able to do two days at a time."
13219.0,Patient,So what time is the care group I have worked I have worked Monday.
386.0,Provider,and get back into it here.
13219.0,Patient,So you're able to do a four day supply until Monday and then Monday after the group i'll get another four days supply until Thursday. Okay we'll just do that. i'll make it work.

386.0,Provider,Once I get the confirmation and once I get. That confirmation from. There that you checked into that i'd be able to send in an additional 45.
13219.0,Patient,But you're going to send me a four days fire right now. Okay. And then i'll talk to Julie and see if I can get back down to the week.
386.0,Provider,On Thursday that's when you.
13219.0,Patient,"Know does it, what does it say i've only missed one i've only missed one appointment, I called in the other time I missed it wasn't it wasn't a no show."
386.0,Provider,"yeah so what the care intensity reasons are as it says excessive no shows must be seen three times a week. or recommended discharge higher level for higher level of care. And then, looking at your appointments what it. looks like here is that there was a no show on the 23rd of September so yesterday for group. And then there was a no show for individual. therapy that was scheduled on the. And then on 830 of 2021 for individual therapy it's marked out as a no show. And then on. To have a no show. Eight three there's a no show 729. So those are the notion is that they have. Up interference okay i'm sorry I just I I hate to be the you know the bearer of bad news I just didn't want to do to be I wanted to be complete just up front and."
13219.0,Patient,I see I go through another provider as well for individual and they told me that I would have to go ahead. I work full time and also i'm a single dad so.
386.0,Provider,"yeah I get it. I get it man I got four kids of my own, so I completely understand and work is 100% portland so if you're. unable to do that just definitely talked to Julie about it. Julia is the. is the one that could make an override on it."
13219.0,Patient,will be able to do that that's totally up to her.
386.0,Provider,"Really it really depends on how. comfortable you've been in how open you've been with her and how your meetings have been with her so far. It just really depends on if she. feels like she can trust you enough to make sure that you know you're stable and managed and you don't need the additional support. And then, what I would do Joseph is, I would just sit when you talk to her on Thursday just you know. just explained to her like hey look I. I can't go to care groups every. Every three times a week it's just not. Possible and see what she says. Just be. Just be really honest and open with her does, I mean that's the that's The easiest way to you know have somebody understand. When was your last dose of the buprenorphine naloxone. Yesterday, yesterday, they are you currently."
