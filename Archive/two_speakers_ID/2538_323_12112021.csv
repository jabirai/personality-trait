323.0,Provider,yeah yeah he's.
2538.0,Patient,"he's a little mad about that, but I think me hitting a gear, you know, and even though they made him junket I think it probably saved his life because I mean he he was doing reckless too many reckless things. You know, and then he would get mad if I wouldn't dry because he I told him he didn't have a license which he still does so, he was like wanting me to take him everywhere and i'm like look i'm not your chauffeur. Right and then he had heard that I have like money one night and he was like well, let me borrow what money you have so I gave him my right, and you can just use my truck I said. No, I said, because I know how it's going to go i'm going to give you the money and then you're going to be going with your truck all the time and i'm going to be sure.

My son and my son's like So what are you going to do just just have her cremated and Center out there on the shelf with the rest of the other family members. Like being very rude and disrespectful to my dad. yeah my dad's just that up with him. And my dad told me he was like if he says anything about you know call them the Court she was like how am I did it. And so within three minutes me calling the Court has the quarter, called the Attorney the Attorney called trenton he was beating up my door, he was like what did you do. Over like What do you mean what they do. He was like thanks to you, he was like my court hearing got canceled i'm like whoa I didn't do nothing. Right like so somebody called I said, you have grandpa, you have my sister. You have."
323.0,Provider,If anyone who comes in contact with could have called.
2538.0,Patient,"Right, and I think if he goes to jail, I think the girl the girlfriend will leave him."
323.0,Provider,yeah cuz you said she's kind of she's a problem to.
2538.0,Patient,"She is I mean when we were when I first started with with bright heart, on the other place that I had lived at and they flipped me her and her brother had jumped me and put me over my penis or in threw me into a seizure. My son's home in the state picked up domestic violence charges on both of them. because she pretty much lived with us, and it was his girlfriend. So they did domestic violence. Because it was on another family member pretty much. Right, he says well if you love me and you want to see me happy you'll drop the charges. You know so me being me I didn't go to the court hearing. You know, and they dropped the charges, but she still had truancy charges and everything else you know and now here, he is 21 hasn't about to be 21 this is his last year that he can attend school. Right, and you know when I walked in to the Court yeah I finally took the letter to the Court, yesterday I said, this is, I have freakin habit with you, with it, which are really added that point. And then you know. And he is the Clerk of court so may have to take it back to probation and give us the bailiff well i'm right before I started with her, I was on probation. and My old probation probation officer walked out, he was like you look familiar don't I know. And i'm like yeah I used to be used to my probation officer. And he was like what are you here, for I was like i'm supposed to drop this off is on the bail or the bailiff and he started reading it, he was like. Oh, he was like I think we can take care of this, he was like you know because I mean I completed their their program and their probation and everything like I you know they didn't have no no issues."
323.0,Provider,Right right.
2538.0,Patient,"So I think you know and that and in those terms, you know the probation officer was like you know, he was like i'll try to you know see what I can do to help you, you know, I have a little bit more push because i'm the head probation officer of the department. He was like it, he was like i'm sorry he was likely he he's probably going to go to jail on the 21st. He says, I know it's going to suck because he's gonna set Christmas in jail, but um you know and they had me bring in a picture of my mom's headstone as well you know because they're going to try to a wake up call with. And you know I told the probation officer, you know what trenton and you know, stated that the guy that followed them back from Columbus to smoke weed with them through white powder on them and placing them all in drug them. And the probation officers like you know how many times we've heard that story. He was like way too many times, he was like obvious I said, you know and the the picture of him before him on drugs and one of the judge sees him I think it's it's going to be pretty bad. And I mean I. And I think that'll give me, you know time if he goes to jail, to get out of here. Right or another place to live. And and just you know, writing and tell them, you know hey I love you, you know i've tried to tell him. Sorry, my sister's texting me one when she was like what are you doing but um. it'll give me time to get you know, hopefully find a place and get out of here. You."

And he he's gonna end up in jail, I know he knows, I mean they've already told me or you know. fact that he is going to end up in jail. And then i'm. Like, then you know, maybe we can focus on getting you where you need to be in. A way you know from the. The proper is so that way I just I can't get a little more."
323.0,Provider,"Like there's so many sad things about this, but also, I mean you were so excited to move into this. New space, I remember when you were moving in and. Great it was going to be to have him in his own space next door and. Really turn so fast."
2538.0,Patient,"Right and he went to the store the other night and I I had an appointment on on the planet as meeting my sister with.

323.0,Provider,If he doesn't.
2538.0,Patient,"Like I hate waiting. But it's like a part of me that he it's you know when he does finally start to prove himself it's going to take our very, very long time for me to gain any trust back for him. Right, just like my parents did me."

Is quote says that she's selling the House and everything and he's moving and what the other sister, but I just think that they don't want his sister out there, so they found somebody else so. And that's another thing you know, like if she comes and says, but she can't climb steps so you know we're gonna have to find something with no steps. So, but um there's only like four four of us holding this time that you know, like the whole it, but my great is on hospice too so we're stopping to see her on her way out of you know Ohio so."

Okay, you you you stop my career a long time ago by not giving me these these certificates."
323.0,Provider,It sounds a little insensitive.
2538.0,Patient,"Right. And so, he just keeps finding random things to drop off, and so I mean I I think he's just trying to keep himself busy right."
323.0,Provider,say it sounds like his own grieving process is kind of taken over.
2538.0,Patient,"um so I mean i'm hoping this kind of helps him in his in his ways. So I mean I just he needs. He needs, you know, out of his own head and everything as well you know what I mean. So we're just kind of like you know doing our our own thing and on from there. Oh."
