13490.0,Patient,Good i'm like what's going on.
506.0,Provider,"Sorry, I was in a group that ran over so i'm sorry about that."
13490.0,Patient,"No, no worries, how are you."
506.0,Provider,"Good, how is the one for you."
13490.0,Patient,Good I graduate on November the eighth from.
506.0,Provider,This treatment facility oh wow that's good to know and then Where are you going after that.
13490.0,Patient,"i'm going to I was trying to go to a transitional living place but because they have such a you know large waiting list. What i'm doing now is finding a home group a home group next to my brother's house and i'll stay there until one of the places, you know comes available but that's what good my brother and my sister in law or a good support team, so you know i'm not worried about going to their home."
506.0,Provider,it's gonna be all right okay.
13490.0,Patient,"And then, yes i'm still going to meet with you there. easier because I will feel like I feel me. You know my soapbox retreat, it does help me, you know tremendously. Sure sure, so the thing of it is um that's not something that you just like stop."
506.0,Provider,cold Turkey.
13490.0,Patient,"Yes, I know."
506.0,Provider,"You know that Okay, and so in so i'm never gonna let you run out it's an emergency, if someone says i'm running out of you know i'll never let that happen you you, you always call and that will alert me. Okay, because because. Your brain needs that right now. You know, and if you go off of it we're going to slowly taper."
13490.0,Patient,"Yes, okay and that's what they do is methadone. yeah now there is a bird. A has my concern i'm not sure if i'm going to have to switch to methadone only because I know you said, we cannot add another spirit right."
506.0,Provider,"it's you know I talked to I talked to another psychiatrist and addiction doctor and they. there's just not that much evidence showing that for is better than three because all your opioid receptors are blocked, with three so it so. you've got like know you know how this medication blocks opioids so that you don't have any desire to have any opiate. Yes, okay you can't walk a much more than what you use for three so that's what so."
13490.0,Patient,"What is my. yeah my concern. yeah the pain aspect of it, because I know it has the opiate Blocker in it, but it also has the pain medication. And here we have chores and they're really like i'm thinking, maybe once I get home, which is next you know next month um I can maybe take that one away, but right now, my concern is that i'm having a lot of and I expressed that during my survey as well. That you know it was working great in the beginning, but I just don't know if i'm building a tolerance for it i'm not sure if that's possible i'm not sure that's why I wanted to talk with you about it."
506.0,Provider,"So so interestingly, a miracle when it comes to pain. We use lower doses for people who have pain. and So so you're on a dose that's for for someone who's got an opioid addiction issue, and you can have both opioid addiction and pain issues, you can have both. But it seems like lower doses more often treat pain better so some of my patients take this take it four to five times a day they but they'll take something like four milligrams five times a day. So. Take it more often, when you have pain."
13490.0,Patient,"Okay, I don't want to take it more often only because. I am added and, eventually, I want to taper off and be completely off everything but the whole the whole point of me having to take it at a certain time and i'm still putting something in my mouth is bothering for does that make sense."
506.0,Provider,yep yep.
13490.0,Patient,"So I was thinking in my brain thinking that if I added one, it would help with the pain, but, but if you're saying that it will. know it like it is."
506.0,Provider,"I mean, some people, if you want to go that route, some people take one and a half strips two times a day, so they have less to put in their mouth and maybe we think about gabba penton for pain. there's other. Oh, you do, how much you take care of that."
13490.0,Patient,I paid 200 milligrams three times a day.
506.0,Provider,doesn't do anything.
13490.0,Patient,"For you Oh, it helps tremendously with my leg pain."
