15914.0,Patient,"know when she prescribed it, she said, if the side effects were too much, I could kind of take half okay. No, I wouldn't have done that otherwise. At that time I was still working full time hours, I did that, for those fighting dry mouth and nausea while I was at work and it's a really physical job so i'm already really thirsty when i'm there."

740.0,Provider,"Okay. let's see what she says, other than that how the anxiety."
15914.0,Patient,"Is there. I had a dream about work. The hospital. I always had dreams, that it was suddenly get to be like 4pm and I hadn't done anything all day. hmm I had done any work I hadn't assess the patients are given on their medications or anything. Nothing so Similarly, I dreamed that I was at work at the hotel and it was four o'clock and I still had like four rooms left out of like five or six."
740.0,Provider,which would.
15914.0,Patient,"happen, but this is what happened and everyone was in like this restaurant having a party. And so I went down there and i'm like hey I got four rooms left, can you all come and help me and they were willing to help. So we all got into service elevator which then changed into this giant room kind of like Alison Wonderland with all these random doors and everybody started going out with random door, so I went out of door into something I was in a mall. i'm i'm on the third floor I go up one flight and some of them on the sixth floor maybe this is because I watched him a glitch in the matrix videos on tick tock I don't know, but this is what happened in my dream. So try to go outside and i'm suddenly on the ground level of a college campus and it's also suddenly 8pm i'm like nobody's still here i'm going. hi That was the end of the dream I don't remember anything after that but that's. anxiety type dream is to have all the time when I worked at the hospital. huh yeah trying to get my work done and I couldn't, for whatever reason. So."
740.0,Provider,So housings it in real life without the dirty.
15914.0,Patient,"Air I feel it mostly when like i'm coming in from somewhere. else where i'm coming from how long i've been gone or anything. that's, for whatever reason, the first 10 minutes or so i'll just get real tightness in my chest, and just feel really anxious and I don't know why I have no reason but it's there and then. I worry that i'm up late for work. When i'm going to go to work, I have a what I call a soft alarm which is an APP called sleep cycle. hmm that way it's supposed to wake you up and a half an hour window. When you're at the lightest phase asleep so with that I don't wake up during a dream or anything it's really nice when it works. It doesn't always work, so I said what I call a hard alarm which is just a normal alarm for 730 because I have to be up by 730 and then I said, another one for 745 and another one for eight just so I don't lose track of time. So and usually I don't but that kind of helps keep me on track with any to get ready to start getting ready about 815. Particularly if i'm going to wind up in the bathroom. I take leads us and it gives me urgency."
740.0,Provider,mm hmm.
15914.0,Patient,that's not fun. So early enough to deal with that before.
740.0,Provider,Absolutely.
15914.0,Patient,"It happens either right when I get up or right after me. Okay yeah so I can know that and I can kind of plan for it. um that's why I have alarms if I don't go when I first get up, then I gotta eat at 745."
740.0,Provider,list at least you have it scheduled. You can. Get the relief that you need at the end it's timely fashion.
15914.0,Patient,Never do that. But i'm getting old.

740.0,Provider,You find.
15914.0,Patient,Mostly where my blonde hair used to be.
740.0,Provider,i'll really used to be.
15914.0,Patient,A few had a few here and there are kinda like highlights. hmm actual highlights but mostly that's where the grades are starting to come in. yeah.
740.0,Provider,"let's do an assignment. And i'll let you know when a nominee come back to me, so this was an anxiety assignment, I actually like to do this assignment, especially since, you said that the time where you're anxious, the most when you come in the House. yeah but then you don't know why so just kind of like overall assignment it doesn't have to be this situation particular just period in life okay. So we do what could happen versus what will happen, so it says when you are worried about something it's easy to imagine the worst thing that could possibly happen in reality, these worries may never come true what could happen isn't the same as what will happen so. Angela what are some what is something that you are currently worried about."
15914.0,Patient,"I don't know I don't know what prompted anxiety when I come home from somewhere I don't even know what that's about, but I you."
740.0,Provider,know it just started.
15914.0,Patient,"It started when I live with the hoarder. quarter X and I think it was because we had all this stuff in the House, but we don't have that now. Okay, and I got rid of everything like literally I got I completely cleaned out the House I don't even have my stuff left over because I couldn't find it. hmm it was so hard enough, but I thought, by the time I got the House credit I just didn't care anymore I didn't want stuff it was it was the worst and he. felt invisible he would he would argue with me whenever I tried to say anything about it. um I would try to throw stuff away and he'd get mad. And it wasn't stuff that we need, and it was like empty coffee cans and the ice cream buckets and stuff like that. He would keep the empty boxes to like pop tarts go the way to keep the box, he would walk out the ice cream in my coffee cancer was never anything gross like it wasn't attracting bugs or anything, it was just there, I called it, clean garbage. stacks of. ads and newspapers and things like that. And when I first went out the House and put everything in storage and I started trying to go through that and find my stuff and a year later, I hadn't found anything. So I signed up on the storage and let them get rid of it because, like, I was so overwhelmed I couldn't get I couldn't do it anymore. yeah, but when I come home now like we, I mean we have what I would call normal amount of stuff we have dressers and you know bed so bit of furniture. We live in a small apartment but I don't know where it comes from and i've been trying to figure that out like, why is it when I come in the House from somewhere I get a really tight feeling in my chest I don't know where."
740.0,Provider,Now I want to know too.
15914.0,Patient,yeah I like to know where where stems from because I haven't been able to figure out.
740.0,Provider,"I mean, is there is there, something that used to happen when you were living with a holder."
15914.0,Patient,"Not that I can remember, and I know when we used to go out he Okay, so he always insisted on grocery shopping The night before I had to work, the next day, I had to get up at 530 for work. mm hmm he would take for ever to get to the store, even if I tried to like go ahead of him and get stuff that we needed he would just go up and down every aisle himself it never like made it faster. And we would get home and like 11 or 12 o'clock at night and i'd have to get up the next morning for work, I don't know if that's part of the work came from."
740.0,Provider,as possible.
15914.0,Patient,"yeah and then the groceries would just get put in the kitchen and the refrigerator stuff would get put away, but then he would put everything away the next day, while I was at work. So it made it difficult to do anything in the kitchen, because the rest, the houses boarded up anyway couldn't put the groceries anywhere else. So may have started there but it came on over time that I don't even like remember one specific thing and. Now, like we don't even have that problems I don't know unless that's why sorry because I used to have a lot of anxiety about going to work. The hospital, it was horrible I always worry doesn't kill somebody give a wrong medication or something. Because those stressful and it was so. Fast paced but everything had to be correct. So. I don't know why why I had that dream about the hotel this hotel job it's not stressful."
740.0,Provider,At own.
15914.0,Patient,"it's just a bunch of cleaning and rapid fire and it's busy but I wouldn't call it stressful. mm hmm and but I don't want to go back to the hospital because of it, it was so stressful and i've been hearing on tech talk and things that it's worse now because it comin. Right so yeah turn my face he got really bad dry skin."
740.0,Provider,"If. You can scratch, a face."
15914.0,Patient,any longer I got really bad right getting to do something about it um but. yeah. I don't want to go back to the hospital when I get my license back.
740.0,Provider,So anyone who do.
15914.0,Patient,I want to go into dialysis. Oh yeah my husband was on dialysis home for four years.
740.0,Provider,hmm.
15914.0,Patient,"So I want to do that it's boring and that's the way I like it. I don't know how much you know about dialysis but he did peritoneal dialysis at home. And the most stressful thing about that was the stupid delivery every month. yeah the drivers. know. yeah they would start fights with me. It was awful but anyway that's been over because he got a chance plenty year ago. A little bit more, so he hasn't had to do it out. Dallas is since the transplant, but even when they did the transplant, even if he had needed dialysis they would have done hemodialysis because they took out as to. Okay, for some reason. When they did the surgery, and they took the two about it didn't click in my brain that we were not going to be doing PT anymore even. Even houses. And it took like a month, maybe like oh yeah. We. Did we did it, seven days a week for four years. mm hmm it was yeah in it, it was really easy it was. It really easy it was a routine and so hemodialysis isn't as easy but it's not like the hospital. know I want to go into dialysis but they started like four in the morning, so there's that."
740.0,Provider,Was me.
15914.0,Patient,"About four in the afternoon. hmm sometimes later so that's that might be rough but, again, if I do that but i'm because I just want to work part time a couple days a week, I don't want to do well, if I don't have to I don't want to do full time again. Right i've got i've got this bad hip I mean if I don't have to financially. Is what I mean. i'm i've got bad hit. That really was acting up yesterday when it was raining. Here it was storming bow yesterday and the day before yesterday was Monday. Sunday, I was at work, and I was limping because it was raining in my hip was super stiff and I was trying to work and then yesterday it was pretty bad too, because it was storming but today it's better because the brain stopped and the sun's out so. I think the pressure, whatever causes that pain kind of. passed on through but anyway so back to the anxiety, I had a lot when I worked in the hospital just because I worried about everything that could go wrong. mm hmm um but. With the hotel, just like there really isn't stuff to go wrong. Just money rooms and be done. And as far as coming home I don't. I don't know because now and it still feels weird and I don't know why but. I make sure we don't go shopping at night. Okay, and it's all so it's always coming home during the day really early like two three in the afternoon so don't have to worry about. Being a brew the next day or anything it's just the but he. I don't know why he got my head so bad, maybe because he was mentally ill, that our table that. He was diagnosed with schedule typical personality disorder. My older at."
740.0,Provider,Okay okay.
15914.0,Patient,"yeah and I didn't know this until towards the end of the relationship. mm hmm so I knew something was wrong was off. But I didn't my mom thought he was on drugs, I never thought he was on drugs, because one money never went missing too he just didn't act like he was under the influence on him drink alcohol, maybe three or four times in the five years that we were together that was it."
740.0,Provider,uh huh.
15914.0,Patient,"And he smoked a pipe. pipe tobacco. That was it he didn't do any that I ever saw or witness or thought he didn't think he ever did drugs and I live with him. But, after all, the stuff with our kids happened, and my oldest he gives me this box from CPS from years back. he's like here read how they operate. i'm like he was paranoid. So. I was going through the paperwork and I found an old psych EVAL. And i'm on when I read that it made everything made so much more sense. yeah and then I went to the library and I googled like signs and symptoms excuse a couple percent of disorder and everything matched. Just about just about except for like weird dress or something and I didn't think he dressed oddly he just dressed in really old clothes like from the 70s."
740.0,Provider,hmm.
15914.0,Patient,"I never thought he just oddly he wear jeans with a shirt and tuck it in and put a belt on I never thought that was like strange, but his shirts for from like the 1970s, that kind of thing. Or maybe. My new clothes, is what it was. But he was parents are not saying didn't match either. But, but we would be driving down the street. And there would be like a white down parked on the side of the road, for example, with his flashers on. And he would say. Oh they're signaling that we are coming. And I looked at, I was looking at him and I was a signaling to WHO. And he never had an answer he just we wouldn't say anything."
740.0,Provider,hmm.
15914.0,Patient,"I don't know if you realize like Howard Nicholas attended, but he never replied."
740.0,Provider,So he didn't show any of these attributes before I got married.

740.0,Provider,right before yeah and this. happens again.
15914.0,Patient,"I didn't know. Until I read that diagnosis, I didn't know what was wrong. And it got way worse after his dad died. Like. way worse yeah. The hoarding the skits a typical everything got way worse after his dad and his dad died in 2010 we got together, and it was seven. uh huh yeah everything got way worse after."
740.0,Provider,I graduated high school.

15914.0,Patient,And self esteem.
740.0,Provider,Well yeah is necessary.
15914.0,Patient,"But it's more about it was more about the self esteem than the common sense but anyway so. I just I knew something was off, but I just thought he was different. Like. I was had an open mind I didn't think that he had like an actual mental illness until later, and then I found the diagnosis and i'm like."
740.0,Provider,And then also Google.
15914.0,Patient,"Things that hoarder say and every one of those came out of his mouth. So he's never been diagnosed with hoarding, but I think he was a hoarder before hoarding was called that. rhyme yeah because he's older than me by 15 years. So yeah so he was an adult when I was still a kid. Okay, and I knew him when him and it's extra together and we've got over there, I tried to clean up his house and then it would return, but we didn't know that was courting. It was just a mess and we go help clean it up and then it would it would it would get put back that way, but in the 90s, we weren't thinking about hoarding like that wasn't a term that anybody talked about. yeah and yeah he has a son, who was born in 94. So. And i'm I was born in 79 so there's that."

740.0,Provider,And where are they.
15914.0,Patient,"They live in turlock, which is the. 10 minutes down the road. But their adoptive mom. I think she got really offended by something I did on Facebook and even though I apologized and I, it was just a photo I took it down and I told her I didn't know it would hurt her feelings and I apologize took it down I didn't just replace it, I took it down."
740.0,Provider,mm hmm.
15914.0,Patient,"She never talked to me again after that. I don't know she just didn't, believe me, if she didn't think I was sincere or she just expecting me to be in my I don't know."
740.0,Provider,right but.
15914.0,Patient,"I send them a birthday card every year I don't get any kind of response. I haven't sent gifts with it because of that because I don't even know if they're getting it, but I keep sending it to the last address that she gave me. And that's, all I can do and but yeah unless they decide they want to get in contact with me and and I include my return address every time. has my address. So if they want to get in contact with me they they know where to start."
740.0,Provider,"So i'm being I was it, what was the photo."
15914.0,Patient,What.
740.0,Provider,"You said you say you had to put up a photo on Facebook and I think. Oh, the photo."
15914.0,Patient,"It was a photo of the youngest holding his hands up and a heart to heart mom. Okay, and I saved it to my phone and put it as my profile picture. And I upset her and I didn't know it was gonna upset her and I apologized and I took it down and I replaced it and I took it I completely deleted it I didn't replace his voice he replaced me that people can still scroll back and see them. Right yeah so I actually like made sure I got took it down. But I guess the only thing I can assume that that wasn't good enough, and she was upset so upset by she stopped talking to me. yeah there's I don't she never told me anything different that's The last thing I have to go off of, and that was in I think. So yeah. But anyway, if people are going to get. hurt over a photo."
740.0,Provider,"You probably was just offended by it, because you know the you know, since you gave him up for adoption that she's mom and that and that you yeah."
15914.0,Patient,"yeah from something that she said, I think she has family that doesn't know that there are that doesn't know that she's still in Canada, I don't know she says something about, to the effect of that she didn't want to have to explain it to people."
740.0,Provider,mm hmm.
15914.0,Patient,"I wasn't sure what I dont still don't really know what that means, but my oldest is half black and he he's like obviously half black. Like and the two younger ones don't look anything like her and her husband something can be they're gonna know they're adopted. Right oh sorry."
740.0,Provider,There you got another there.
15914.0,Patient,"Because my oldest was like. 12 when it all happened. So i'm sure he remembers um but. Okay, I don't know what the thing was she didn't want to have to explain to people."
740.0,Provider,mm hmm.
15914.0,Patient,"that's that's where i'm a little confused but that's what she said to me, the last conversation we had people are confused by and she didn't want to have to explain it. But she didn't really go into a ton of detail about whatever that meant. So."
740.0,Provider,So how to I mean if you care to share habit the habit that even become a thing or what what happened to your children has to be adopted.
15914.0,Patient,"So it started with the hoarding and they got. taken a CPS because that my ex husband. and I got the kids back after like a year and cleaning out my house they. Every time I see this people think i'm blaming them i'm not blaming them. In a word, exactly to you have ordered it to everyone else. You see what you think. They came home with behaviors they didn't have before they remove the first time. Okay, they were peeing and pooping on the floor, they were taking food out of the fridge and throwing it on the floor, they were getting things everywhere. One I couldn't keep up with it. Because there's three of them, and one of me, too, I did not know where to turn for help, no one was offering me help I didn't have a support system and things came to a head one night when I was attempting to discipline my middle one. I didn't do it in the best way I admit that, but he started screaming the neighborhood and called the COPs they came out the House was a mess they thought they removed him the second time. I got a criminal conviction for the dirty house. I lost my job. Fortunately, I had my husband, who was falsely arrested and accused of stalking before I met him everything got dropped, but when CPS ran his fingerprints, they wouldn't even deal with him. mm hmm and I didn't have anywhere else to go anywhere to live I didn't have an income. And we were getting along like he's not abusive or anything on Taylor bit more about that later, but. He never should have been in jail. The woman absolutely like it was her fault. hmm um. And it was all dismissed in the end because it's on his record came up when they fingerprinted him, they said they wouldn't replace the kids with us, if he was there. So that was one factor. More than a year had gone by, I was still like. trying to figure out and I didn't have I lost my job, all that I lost my nursing license and so when they approached me about adoption, I felt like it was the best solution for the kids and for myself. Because I. didn't think that I was going to get back on my feet quick enough and I was right because i'm still trying."
740.0,Provider,mm hmm.
15914.0,Patient,"So, and I didn't feel like I was in a good place to try all that, so I agree to the adoption and the couple that adopted them are actually their daycare providers before it all happened. Okay, so it all worked out for the best, except for the falling out but. My that's that's the gist of what happened."
740.0,Provider,"And i'm trying to figure out what did I showed you with with what, what are the choices for their to house."
15914.0,Patient,"Child endangerment. But when you read when so it's it's expunged now, but when you read the wording of the conviction that sounded like I was beating my kids and I was not at all. But that's what it does, how it was worded. it's the same conviction, whether you've got a dirty house or you're driving drunk with them in the car or you're you know doing anything else to endanger them. mm hmm so in my case, it was more of what I didn't do. So. I got the conviction in January is arrested in February 15. And then I got a gentleman under cognizance because I already knew about that and and the first thing I said to the training was can I get on my on my or. So he got me out of it, or because I had a I had a job I needed to go to work at the time, and so I still working at central King general. So I thought it for a year to court, once a month for a year and tried to do something different finally accepted a please great a plea agreement, instead of three felony counts it got reduced to one misdemeanor. And however, this is before ban the box became a thing, and every time I try to go to get a job, because it was still a new conviction, they run a background check, they would they would say no, I couldn't even give away free cell phones."
740.0,Provider,hmm.
15914.0,Patient,"So this was in 2016 I had this attorney, who was a public defender he said to me get all your stuff done don't reoffend basically and when your probation done, they will expand your for you, they have to. i'm like all right so from that day I had my antics punishment, so I did I did all my stuff I even went back to court and got my community service changed from they wanted me to work in a thrift store and it absolutely bores me to tears I couldn't tolerate it. I couldn't tolerate and it was so boring. Like it was worse than the hotel. The hotel is not mentally stimulating, but this was way worse. I get paid to be at the hotel, this was way worse. So I went back to court. Because I like teaching that ELISE it wasn't simulate but it wasn't I wasn't bored to tears either. Right I, and I use my bad hip as excuse. So. So I got a kingdom Tutoring finished my hours doing that. got everything done just like I finished right on time. And then they dismissed my probation just a few months early they dismissed it in August, it would have been done, I think, in December. So just a few months early as soon as they did that I started talking to the attorneys about punishment for some reason I don't remember the whole reason I didn't start that process until the following February, and then it took a year, so I got Max punishment in January of this year. Then. I had to wait like 90 days for everything to update it with co but I thought it was gonna take a while. So, in the summer I started job hunting I applied it to veto they wouldn't work with me, because my license has been expunged and on I mean not expired or revoked and on there, it gives the reason, so they were able to see everything. So, then you. Give me a chance, but then I found out that I can't work in medicine anymore. Because there's something called a medical which is California I don't know where you are it's California virgin of medicaid. Exclusion list. Right I can't work for anyone who takes medicare and medicaid. As pain I didn't know that until after I had to play with the beta.

740.0,Provider,mm hmm.
15914.0,Patient,"This one I applied at the hotel and got it. And when I did the background check at the hotel, I asked for a copy and it came back as clear so fan the box is a California law that they started in 20 enacted in 2018. If anything's been expends dismissed, etc, it will be reported to the employer. If. Something I think is older than seven years it will be reported they only go back seven years now there are certain exceptions to that rule of depends on the type of job, the type of background check etc, but for just like me trying to get a job in hotel it worked."
740.0,Provider,Right.
15914.0,Patient,And they did a background check. And once I get my license back the the Attorney said i'll get removed from the medical exclusion list and that won't be a problem.
740.0,Provider,mm hmm.
15914.0,Patient,"Good news is I don't think i'm on the federal version of that list. Good yeah I tried every which way to find my name on there and cutting that doesn't mean i'm not on there, but it doesn't seem like I am. i'm i'm going to talk with the Attorney further about that. When the time comes, because right now I literally just have to save up money that's where it's at."
740.0,Provider,How much does he get your license but.
15914.0,Patient,"it's going to be expensive, I need 1500 just for the retainer just will they can tell me if they if they think I can win and then they said, if they don't think I can win now they'll tell me how to get there. But there's also a bunch of paperwork, I have to get together and do and that's going to take me hours. So, and I haven't started yet because i've been trying to get settled with this job. Right finally happening, but i've been ignoring the House for over a month, so I gotta get that done, and then I can start this paper and the holidays and stuff so peiser after the holidays."

740.0,Provider,"that she was able to keep those other control and so she was like she just said, take the whole thing and then see how they do this."
15914.0,Patient,"I was thinking, the same thing i'll start that today."
740.0,Provider,"Okay. I got anything. If anything happens between now and then, and you don't see her yet just let me know and then i'll do the same thing I did today."
15914.0,Patient,"Okay, and. This is completely off topic."
740.0,Provider,I don't even know what.
15914.0,Patient,"If you know kids at around 10 years old. hmm, this is a joke, you can tell them, you can tell me have 11 fingers and they're gonna be like no I don't like yeah 10 9876 plus five on the other hand."
740.0,Provider,My dad oh my gosh.
15914.0,Patient,From when I was a kid yeah.
740.0,Provider,"Oh, my gosh. hilarious. But I don't think I run into too many teen years I mean my baby just turned six months yesterday, so when I don't wait a few years."
15914.0,Patient,yeah you got a while. Maybe it'll stick in your head you'll remember it one day we.
740.0,Provider,might be so. Mad so far right into a key if I run into a cave now. I might have to try it out.
15914.0,Patient,"If I see like at my church or whatever, if I see kids run that age, I try to remember to do it. It always confuses them 10 1112 is the perfect age. It always confuses them. yeah they're like. Oh, I use I use the other game I don't know if you've ever heard of a way we."
740.0,Provider,"When you can actually. Well, you could tell them that you know they can pick a number and, as you can tell you can guess what it is. So this is like this. It says pick a number between one and 10 you can say I don't want to always say don't tell me. just pick the number. And then you say add two to it. And then you add three to it and then i'm like don't tell me just figure it out i'm gonna just keep the number of your head, then it says subtract the number that you have now from the number that up. And of course the number is going to be five. don't do it again do it again."
15914.0,Patient,matter what number you start with.
740.0,Provider,Right it doesn't matter what number you saw when dishing. yeah they see.
15914.0,Patient,i've heard that way.
740.0,Provider,"yeah and I sometimes I do like a huge number like i'll say. i'll pick a number between one and 1000. yeah okay we're at 152 okay with this time air to 35 to it okay that's attractive like that yeah but you know you saw saying what the number is it. yeah no do it again do it at the end of the day, no so that's the I know."
15914.0,Patient,"Anyway, so the attorneys 1500 to start the moment they can pick the case that the candle keep the retainer and then that gets me to the hearing, and then the hearing, I have to pay like another 5500 if it goes it's very expensive. But I have a better shot at winning my license back with the Attorney. At not winding up on probation. And having to like do 20 literally 20 things do maintain my license and then it would make hopefully finding a job, a little bit easier if I didn't have to do 20 things."
740.0,Provider,Absolutely.
15914.0,Patient,"For the board yeah. So what I got the packet in my email, and in the mail and I looked at it and I got really overwhelmed. And i'm like I don't think I can do this by myself, so I committed to memory, the first two things I have to do and i'm going to start with that and the first thing is going to take me hours. it's this paperwork, I was talking about, I have."
740.0,Provider,So I square dance okay.
15914.0,Patient,"Okay, and i'm very good at it and it's my favorite thing to do, but."
740.0,Provider,wow.
15914.0,Patient,"We have a building, so we live in, I live in series but pesto riverbank there is a town out here called oakdale cuz I don't know how familiar, you are with California, but."
740.0,Provider,Nowhere I live in Dallas.
15914.0,Patient,"oakdale is east of us since it's like northeast me takes me because. there's no way to get there on the freeway it's about a 30 minute drive through town. But there's a building there, called the brainchild that we all dance it and I clean that building your i've been doing it for. Five years but i've never kept me records on it, so I have to go back and do like performance evaluations, for the last five years. it's like every. camera what she said, every three or four months for five years. And, and the person who runs the building is my friend he's completely agreed to do that, but I just haven't had time to sit down and find one online and print it out and fill it out and all that it's gonna take me a while to. Do those and then he agreed to sign them, so I got to start with that, and then I have to do 30 hours of continuing education, which I thought it was going to be this 1200 dollar continue continuing education class and it's not so that was a relief. yeah you can do 30 hours for about $30."
740.0,Provider,Yes.
15914.0,Patient,"it's not that expensive and then she wrecked the Attorney recommended that sometime between when I submit the paperwork and when the hearing, as I do, another 30 on my best I can do this, no problem 30 hours only takes me about two. yeah it's not. yeah it's not really 30 hours or whatever."
740.0,Provider,Of course man they get those credits you for them much.
15914.0,Patient,"Right yeah I did I did all the time when I worked as a nurse. But it was only the last time or two, so I started, I became a nurse and oh seven when I renewed and oh nine I didn't have to submit continuing education, because it hadn't been two years yet, because I graduated in spring, you are new on your birthday. So i'm the second time in 11 is you said check this box, if you did your continuing education that I checked it had I done it no. i'm sure people do the same thing, because then in 2013 when I went to renew I had to provide the number. Then, when when patient and then in 2015 I had to do the same thing so. i'm pretty sure that, like they started doing that because they knew people were not doing it. yeah yeah but anyway. I lost my train of thought I do this, a lot."
740.0,Provider,No it's fine we was talking about the 50 $500. Oh it's kind of 15 and damned if they can help the new. yeah.
15914.0,Patient,"Well that's where that's what I have to save up money. I do want to be assessed for ADHD. or a dd all three of my kids have been diagnosed with it. um I guess was diagnosed with OCD I think he gets up from his dad, though, because all that and his dad aunt had a lot of OCD like fines for at least one I think she's never been diagnosed that's just my personal opinion. Like to me and with my mom. I think i'm almost narcissistic."
740.0,Provider,OK.
15914.0,Patient,"OK, I think my dad is just passive and didn't want to stand up to my mom that's what I think. i'm."
740.0,Provider,Without low. so low. Low yeah so he just passive you know he just didn't want to set up to yeah such a low blow.
15914.0,Patient,"Oh, he never stood up to my teachers either. Okay, when I was in school, I told you about that right."
740.0,Provider,We didn't get.
15914.0,Patient,"Well, I was bullied by. Oh yeah anytime in it. And my teachers would tell me that if I didn't cry they wouldn't pick on me."
740.0,Provider,yeah I remember.
15914.0,Patient,"Their exact words i'm 42 and I remember that. yeah yeah So when I was in high school, it was worse than when I was in grade school. And we went to have a meeting with, I think it was my science teacher. And my English teacher and somebody else my English teacher was a kid I think it was fresh out of college, he was maybe 10 years older than the rest of us, he should not have been teaching high school, he was trying to be friends with the boys and it was a hot mess. English, but it was a hot mess. yeah um but thinking back on that, like he never should have been teaching high school. I was like the time I worked out now. Summer school when I was 16 they put me I was 16 they put me in a class full of 14 year olds of. Eighth graders that shouldn't happen either. Because, in the same thing they started bullying me and then. One kid through a basketball hit me in the stomach with it, I went home and called my worker and i'm going to tell her about it, and she wasn't there and go back the next day they moved me to a third grade classroom, which is where I should have been in the first place. But anyway, my dad got called in for a meeting with my science teacher. I think it was my English teacher and somebody else and they proceeded to tell him what a disruption, I was in class that was the whole thing a completely putting the blame on me. I would tell him the kids are picking on me, you know i'm just responding Baba blah and yeah it hurts my responses, but I felt it no one ever tried to help me. Right, the only teachers, they ever remember trying to help me with my seventh grade teacher and my ninth grade math teacher and that's it. And I remember their names because of it. My seventh grade teacher her name was Mrs higginbotham and my ninth grade math teacher was Mr Hansen. higginbotham, besides being an unusual name."
740.0,Provider,ma'am yes.
15914.0,Patient,"boy in her class. There was great was great I didn't get bullied in her class nice grade math I did, but he tried to help He really did he tried to help. i'll put it that way, one day, a kid took my sweater and he found in brought to my house, so he did he tried. I think he just didn't know how to do it, you know, he may not have known what to do either."
740.0,Provider,mm hmm.
15914.0,Patient,"um but that's it everybody else Oh, if you wouldn't cry they would pick on you. yeah and I remember this one teacher, when I was in fifth grade my main teacher was Mrs Marino, but then we have substitute I don't remember her name she I just met her looking old and crabby. telus looked crabby. And I don't think she liked me, because every time we had her I got detention suspending I got in trouble. The principal's office so every time we had our and we had her a lot for some reason. But anyway, so that was school, so my dad gets called in there just meeting with my teachers and they proceeded tell him what a disruption, I am. And he's like well, maybe this isn't the best environment for her, and this is his solution let's put me on independent study which wasn't better, but maybe he didn't know what to do either. yeah so yeah but my sisters would pick on me at home, my parents would take the same thing so there's that."
740.0,Provider,"Man, well, we will have to deal with them, because I think that that plays a huge role. as well we don't have time to do all but it is something that we will have some. up and to kind of deal with for see how it plays on the self esteem and how early affects that area of your life and sorry there's something that we will we'll work on that moving forward okay. Have you made your other session yet. Have you made another session yet or Do I need to."
15914.0,Patient,"know but for today they ought to. arbitrarily change the time. And I did. The email, and so, then they texted me this morning i'm like no wait a second it's at four o'clock and fortunately I was able to make it work, but if I don't know if it's a thing, where they can also text me when if they choose the time, but they also didn't ask me they just changed it."
