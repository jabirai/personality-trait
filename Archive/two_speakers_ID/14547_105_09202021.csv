So let's uh let's talk a little bit about how you're doing in this very early recovery. tense how and how frequent are the cravings for you kind of bring me up to speed around that."
14547.0,Patient,"um it's been going pretty good so far it's been it's been kind of tough, though, you know I mean. Definitely saw a lot of cravings and but the suboxone really helps with that, to be honest with you. Compared to like just quitting cold Turkey. But the. there's still yeah I still feel that urge to just. I guess it's more boredom than anything really. That kind of. instigate feelings just. You know. Other than that. All right."
105.0,Provider,"Well, let me have a sense of how intense those cravings were. Zero to 10."
14547.0,Patient,When we were like six or seven.

105.0,Provider,"And you don't have to share, you can just say. yeah i've gone to a couple of times and what i've seen is that sometimes people don't even. Do their name they don't even like turn their video on. So so it's very anonymous if you wanted it to be, but if people had a really great experience with a great you know lecture sometimes people are in it they're really in a in a moment and they're working through something. and Have you you've never gone to any."
14547.0,Patient,i've been to a couple i've been to a couple of a means okay so it's like that. yeah.
105.0,Provider,it's going to be.
14547.0,Patient,familiar with the. anonymous yeah.
105.0,Provider,"Okay, so you have that as support and i'd like to talk a little bit about really where you mentioned boredom. And in a little bit of a longer term plan, what is your plan with boredom what's your plan around that."

105.0,Provider,"you've been looking. yeah okay. All right, and what kind of field of interests."
14547.0,Patient,into much honestly anything i'm probably just going to try to do like deliveries or something like that to make some some extra money something where there's not a huge barrier to entry I got all these legal cases and stuff yeah I mean so there's that issue.
105.0,Provider,"Oh that's right, I did just sign that this morning, you have, I think you said call it a bunch like six."
14547.0,Patient,shades.
105.0,Provider,And so you have an open you haven't pretrial release or. Okay.
14547.0,Patient,drove on.
105.0,Provider,"alright. So let's delve in a little bit too. you're already putting energy into into finding work you, you know i'm not a case manager so that's that's not."
14547.0,Patient,going to be my own.
105.0,Provider,"let's move a little bit closer to when you started seeing. That substance use was a great idea it's like Oh, this is great kind of bring me back into how old you were."
14547.0,Patient,Such a well probably when I first started using any substance you mean.
105.0,Provider,You could think of it like that.
14547.0,Patient,back when I was in my early late teens probably.
105.0,Provider,And what was growing up like for you.
14547.0,Patient,It was pretty good pretty good. Pretty normal.
105.0,Provider,Really bored.
14547.0,Patient,not really no. Not extremely bored.
105.0,Provider,So were you were busy is he doing.
14547.0,Patient,school or work. relationships.
105.0,Provider,"And what did just to make it easy I can either say drugs and alcohol or I can say substance use, but I will mean the same thing. yeah um what was appealing about it back then."
14547.0,Patient,"I don't really know. I guess just just getting on it, I guess, just. Getting hungry man yeah just just the feeling of being high. And then also. Like selling selling weed and stuff like that making money off of it. That type of stuff. And what are the most appealing to me."
105.0,Provider,What was the money for.
14547.0,Patient,"Just just have money, just to survive, you know."
105.0,Provider,So you were in school for it's. working. And you needed the money.
14547.0,Patient,"Because this was well yeah I mean I was originally attracted me this we'd really was people I knew people that were making money off of it. More so than really just getting high off of it. So I went in to learn how they're doing that that to. Then. Money was just to. Just to have money, I mean. Once I was at 18 hours pretty much which are 17 hours out of my own, but from then on, it was that was a means of survival really."
105.0,Provider,"So we started with teens and you, you sort of said everything was fine."
14547.0,Patient,yeah everything was fine I wasn't like unhappy or anything.
105.0,Provider,"So go maybe we'll go into sometimes teenagers at 17 are on the wrong, though, maybe you could talk a little about that."
14547.0,Patient,"Well, just things at home with my mom were very wet very good between between us getting along. So she you know. We just decided it would be better for me to not live at my house, when I was last couple years of my high school."
105.0,Provider,yeah. So at 17 I imagine you felt very adult.
14547.0,Patient,yeah definitely felt way more adult that was for sure.
105.0,Provider,Yes.
14547.0,Patient,"You know, but uh yeah just that was pretty much where I started getting off track with the drug mean."
105.0,Provider,"And when you look at the dynamics between you and your mother now now the older, how do you look at that relationship now."
14547.0,Patient,we're still close we're close we're not as close as we possibly could be or as close as. Her in some way other siblings are but we're close we don't have a bad relationship.
105.0,Provider,"And how is it these other siblings have a closer relationship, what do you think."
14547.0,Patient,"they're just more involved in each other's lives, I mean. Do they do more things together. I mean. You guys. My bad so yeah. i'm sorry she's gonna go with that. So yeah That was a. pretty much that was pretty much when I started using them, we, the most."
105.0,Provider,"This is your first therapeutic treatments set right. yeah Okay, so I do get the sense a little bit like you're waiting for my lead, would you say it feels like that."
14547.0,Patient,yeah a little bit.
105.0,Provider,A lot.
14547.0,Patient,"Well, I mean i'm not really like you know I mean."
105.0,Provider,"it's new for you yeah. Exactly okay i'll talk a little bit about. The way I work and some norms, so that you can feel more confident. You can talk about whatever you want to it doesn't have to be what you think I want to hear about that's not going to be it what's going to be most relevant for you is. Talking where wherever you are for some people it's, not even the talking it's a lot about learning, perhaps for the first time about their on. somatic responses to stress and they learn ways to manage it, they learn ways to pay attention to it, they never did for other people it's working through trauma history. And there will be some interventions around that so you can let me in there for other people it's about communication and they're learning how to communicate with themselves they're learning how to communicate with other people. oftentimes we start with a symptom. Which means whatever's bugging you a nightmare anger depression, anxiety boredom can be one. For some people it's an inability to focus and i'm I don't know your history with memory I don't know if you've been using i'd have to look at your your psycho social if you've been using marijuana daily. sense your teams there's some pretty predictable consequences of that and they might be happening to you. But you can talk about whatever you want. Where do you need support, where do you want change."
14547.0,Patient,um. I guess maybe just learning how to communicate really. seems like i'm not it's hard for me to like get verbalized what i'm thinking yeah I mean okay.
105.0,Provider,"All right, well great."
14547.0,Patient,"yeah I mean I don't know just like. You know, like i've never done this before I don't really know where everything you know I mean it's one of those awkward situations, you know."
105.0,Provider,"Okay. Well, I can get to know that I can get to know what awkward feels like for you so let's go with that this year, and now moment is very relevant so for you and you use the word awkward where do you feel that in your body what is that it."
14547.0,Patient,was aggravated.
105.0,Provider,activated or we might.
14547.0,Patient,"activated uh. I guess just. kind of been a little stressed, you know what I mean like my like a little bit of. I don't know I guess. To my stomach a little bit more."
105.0,Provider,"nervous stomach so. that's somatic so so my means body, so when you feel awkward your stomach signals, probably by the blood flow leaves it and it's not digesting so you have a gastric a stomach response, a lot of people do. And my invitation to you is to pay attention to that first when you're in an interaction with someone. Because the more you become aware of your body, because it's going to signal. Long before you can come up with a word of awkward and I know it works, the other way around, you came up with this word awkward and then I said well pay attention to your body. You probably ignored it and we just went looking for a word, but your body's going to have a response to a relational interaction before you'll even have a word for it it's. Almost instantaneous oftentimes will feel lump in the throat tightness in the chest our stomach churning kind of gets yeah yeah okay that's good for me."
14547.0,Patient,yeah that's the kind of feel yeah.
105.0,Provider,Okay.
14547.0,Patient,Good you need more like my hands and stuff will start moving around.
105.0,Provider,"Okay, and fidget. Okay, so let's now go to a possible alarm that might be going off now we're just going to work on just thoughts for just a second, what is it do you think the worst thing. That could happen here, what is the worst thing that could happen here."
14547.0,Patient,worst thing. I don't even know really I mean you kicked out of the program or something I mean.
105.0,Provider,It kicked out so for a lot of people kicked out makes them think that there's a right way or wrong way to be.
14547.0,Patient,yeah.
105.0,Provider,"They wonder, am I doing it right and then so then we're awkward and there might be a fear associated with will I get kicked out if I don't do it correctly somehow. Okay. um. Now, as far as i'm concerned. Excuse me i'm not recording to to any officer all right. That really does add that that element to it, but at this point there's no wrong way for you to do you so over time i'm hoping that that awkwardness will decrease. You know, probably always be just a little bit of something, because we all do, because you're about to interact with another human. But I want to take away any kind of worried that i'm going to be reporting to someone."
14547.0,Patient,yeah no I hear you I don't think you do that.
105.0,Provider,"Okay, so we talked a little bit about maybe the worst case scenario right so let's talk a little bit now about. The communication. When did you have a similar stomach something was it tight turning sick almost the most recent time you had something like that."
14547.0,Patient,"Yes, maybe at the mvd when I tried to get my car registered I don't know, maybe something like that."
105.0,Provider,"And when when did you go to the mvd. Friday Friday okay. And was that, while you were waiting in line."
14547.0,Patient,"yeah well more when I was at the counter just wanting everything to go work out well, I mean. Not being."
105.0,Provider,And what did you do to manage that that upset stomach.
14547.0,Patient,I just just kind of chilled out.
105.0,Provider,"Okay, so time past."
14547.0,Patient,Time yeah anytime.
105.0,Provider,I guess you didn't run out the door didn't say. No okay. So did you do anything with your mind. And you might think of the mind as a self talk let's say.
14547.0,Patient,"yeah stop thinking, the same thoughts."
105.0,Provider,What was the thought you stopped thinking.
14547.0,Patient,Just that it wasn't gonna work out.
105.0,Provider,Oh negative.
14547.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
105.0,Provider,And what did you replace them with.
14547.0,Patient,pretty much nothing.
105.0,Provider,"Okay that's impressive, how do you get a nothing brain a lot of people aspire to that."
14547.0,Patient,I don't know I kind of good at it.
105.0,Provider,"And for us it. Has. Some people have to know. Okay. Well, it is for right now, it met the need. The need you wanted."
14547.0,Patient,i'm assuming I might need yep.
105.0,Provider,And all kidding always included and not aside when has it been inconvenient for someone else when you have no thoughts.
14547.0,Patient,For my girlfriend when she's trying to communicate with me and I just space out.
105.0,Provider,"There you go. Alright, so now we're getting closer and closer to. really relevant communication back and forth. yeah so it's convenient for you to space out we'll call it space out there's a lot of different words for that there's checkout there's dissociate. there's numb out and for a lot of people that's a great way to not feel."
14547.0,Patient,yeah.
105.0,Provider,So it's probably served you along the way some somewhere somehow inbound will get to know that over time.
14547.0,Patient,yeah.
105.0,Provider,"Well, when it comes to a relationship, give me a story, if you will, with the time that we have, where she was trying to communicate it i'm assuming something important to her and you spaced out and weren't there to maybe let her know you were listening."
14547.0,Patient,"Just a couple of days ago I did that, when she was trying to talk to me about something and I was paying attention to something else and didn't even really know that she was talking to me. Really yeah. Like really I didn't I didn't even know you didn't mean like. Okay, that happens, it happens. Enough you know, like i'm not I can't pay attention to two things at once. So if i'm focused on something like even a TV show and someone's talking to me like I literally won't even hear them talking and so they like raise your voice, or something and then i'm like wait what the Fuck are what the heck and then. they're."
105.0,Provider,In here. you're okay yeah.
14547.0,Patient,"Okay yeah well um anyways well yeah so you know, then. they're upset because i'm not paying attention to them. Realistically i'm not trying to ignore them I didn't even know they were actually talking, I mean. I just feel I feel like I have a. my mind is easily distracted you know what I mean like."
105.0,Provider,Actually um let's back up.
14547.0,Patient,"When I say this, I was. Like if i'm focused on one task. And then I have to do something else that first task i'll completely ignore it or i'll stop right in the middle of it and start doing whatever i'm supposed to do next, instead of just. finishing the last little steps in this part."
105.0,Provider,So what if we rephrased it just a little bit here.
14547.0,Patient,"And my focus can only be on one thing at one time. I. You know, so that creates a lot of issues with just. march pay attention to me or why, why is this. Why don't you finish this the way that I would have finished it while I was finishing this and then someone told me to do this and I go do that you know I mean. Yes, I just my brain doesn't work like that i'm not good at multitasking at all and I can't learn how to do it."
105.0,Provider,"So, for now, what if we make it a little bit more of a positive spin on that and say that you are actually you hyper focus on one thing at a time so let's not say something negative that you don't do this let's actually say that what your brain does. Is it just wants to focus on one thing."
14547.0,Patient,yeah.
105.0,Provider,let's just say that. Instead let's say that it gets hyper focused.
14547.0,Patient,yeah yeah my brain does good.
105.0,Provider,"yeah and so when you actually let's say you have been able to and i'm bet i'll be able to find some history where you have. Where you were not distracted maybe give me an example of where you've been able to hyper focus without interruption, can you give me an example of how you were able to do that. Or we get it."
14547.0,Patient,"Give me an example of service and i'm. Like if i'm by myself, you know what I mean."
105.0,Provider,Okay.
14547.0,Patient,I don't have anyone distracting me or telling me to do this or do that and. Then I can do that really well.
105.0,Provider,"Nice, something you did that took quite a bit of attention."
14547.0,Patient,"I build websites all types of different you know, like tasks like that program things. Just different different things like that."
105.0,Provider,"Okay, so, for now, where i'm just repeating that what you do is hyper focus. It would be good for you to kind of think that was nifty cool not a negative thing would be convenient if you did. Just for our work together okay. And if it was so that it was okay and kind of cool. Then you have permission, maybe I hope to be able to tell the people in your life girlfriend. If I turn my attention away from this. it's very possible I won't be able to come back to it. So let's work out a plan together. So you see what happens once it's Okay, for you to be you there's no shame, which means you don't have to be angry. No defensiveness no insult, but we can get ahead of it, we can start to talk to the people in our life, I think this is how I work best I work well in chunks of time. i'm really good at focusing, but whatever it I turn my focus to that, then we'll have my full attention and this thing I leave behind will get it on attended to. So i'm going to organize my day like this i'm going to do my work here i'm going to take a lunch i'm going to take a break i'm going to go do this exercise i'm going to go back to work. i'm going to go listen to some music i'm going to play a video game i'm going to go shopping so i'm going to organize my date in chunks. And I don't have i'm Is it also true that you don't have a sense of time like it's really hard for you to tell like if I said you'd know what 15 minutes or half hour feels like you really good at knowing time."
14547.0,Patient,From what.
105.0,Provider,You are okay.
14547.0,Patient,Decent but not not.
105.0,Provider,"Not great okay. yeah okay we'll come back to that another time, maybe now that i've mentioned that you might be aware of it, like honestly, if I can kind of feel when i'm focused. Whether i'm aware of time, if I have this this sense of how much time has passed and just go check say I met an hour's past and go look and see check yourself and see that be curious to know. So I want to we're talking, you know about this this thing around focus and just what i'm sharing right now, I want to know how it's landing with you, so I want to know what what's happening for you as i'm sharing this."
14547.0,Patient,"I see I see I see what you're saying like I understand it i'm a little nervous about trying to implement, you know me."
105.0,Provider,"No, I don't nervous about what."
14547.0,Patient,"just trying to have those conversations with people in my life. Okay, no."
105.0,Provider,"Okay, so let's back up remember, I was saying, is it okay. Who, you are. yeah okay well why don't you see if that's 100% true or if there's a percentage that's not quite 100% true."
14547.0,Patient,I mean there's a percentage that's not 100% you know.
105.0,Provider,"What percentage is that that you're that it's not a. 20% okay. And what would happen. If there was even a 10% more acceptance in the coming weeks, that it was even more Okay, for you to be someone who hyper focuses."
14547.0,Patient,With way that's fine probably.
105.0,Provider,"So let me ask. Arguments well, I mean Okay, as you know you think it's okay."
14547.0,Patient,i'm.
105.0,Provider,Always started with you right now.
14547.0,Patient,I don't even know.
105.0,Provider,"yeah so well, let me, let me check on communication, a little bit so fights happen oftentimes because we get offended. So when someone accuses you of something. girlfriend probably and what's the name calling what's the insult what's typically The thing that upsets you."
14547.0,Patient,"um, I think, just like the general like town just. Like you know, the way that the anger like hatred almost find it like your enemy. Energy behind it."
105.0,Provider,Okay.
14547.0,Patient,"Okay, I mean."
105.0,Provider,and And i'm walking in knowing nothing so I can make no assumptions so i've got lots of questions the the tone. Have you used any communication skills to say when you raise the volume of your voice I. I check out and I space out or.
14547.0,Patient,Not I check out Sometimes I get angry too.
105.0,Provider,Yes.
14547.0,Patient,So when.
105.0,Provider,"When the volume and sometimes it's not only the volume, we can get into the actual words that are used, but in general. Have you been able to communicate to girlfriend when there's yelling I feel. Okay. Okay, so no Community."
14547.0,Patient,yeah not much now.
105.0,Provider,"Okay, so when you so, then I see what's probably left is that you show instead of share, because just now, you don't share your anger what you do a show it probably most do until they learn there's a better way. yeah, how do you show that you're angry, how would I see it, with my eyes are here, it was my ears fight I was like oh day he's angry."
14547.0,Patient,just getting loud and costing.
105.0,Provider,You get loud to. And then you start with the F bombs and yeah.
14547.0,Patient,Okay name calling.
105.0,Provider,"him calling got it. So let's back up, and this is where we're going to stay we didn't have a lot of time, so just know this, if you like my theory. That anger and you probably heard little hints of it here and there, and group them and going to too many, but it's pretty common for me to talk about how anger is a secondary protective emotion. And earlier, I was asking you, is it okay that you. Have a particular style style of focus and it come to find out your about okay 80%. So about 80% of the time, someone maybe could say do. you're not very good at multitasking and you aren't going to be offended but about 20% of it you're going to be offended. it's that 20% that concerns me and that's why earlier, I was saying what if you were more okay more accepting of who you are and actually embraced it. There would be less. Or maybe smaller buttons on you that a girlfriend could push because you actually love and like just the way you are you like you are now, this is who you are. So there's now there's less to defend against because you know who you are you likely, you are you're making changes if you want changes there's nothing to defend against you might say, to a girlfriend i'm really hyper which means a lot hyper focused at times. that's kind of how I work it's how my mind works, it makes it possible for me to crank out projects in one day that would take a lot of people that can't focus probably a lot more days, but I can really jam on something if I can just focus on it it's it's my strength. So i'm concerned about the 20%. somewhere along the line I think you have come to believe that that 20% is not Okay, that there is something bad long slog broken and I don't know where it came from, and I don't know what you say, to yourself around it. What what is that that thing that you, you do not accept about who you are, that you don't like."
14547.0,Patient,Exactly really okay.
105.0,Provider,"But just imagine that there's this cool word called ego sin tonic. For disk tonic they're fun words I got lots of them, these are pretty cool reason why I like them is because they encapsulate big paragraphs worth of meaning. If ego sin tonic which means I own it I know it's me and no one can piss me off about it because it's like duh I know who I am like what so if someone says to me. Your analytical you're so analytical i'd say it yeah. and Are they yell you're so fucking analytical i'd say yeah and so i'm not offended by it, I like it about me makes means I can do my job and it's what i'm good at. But there's a part of you, I think that it's dis tonic that your ability to hyper focus is not okay with you. When has it gotten in the way of. Something in your life either a relationship. thing you wanted, perhaps."
14547.0,Patient,um I mean I feel like sometimes it's held me back.
105.0,Provider,From what.
14547.0,Patient,Just from like being 100% present you know.
105.0,Provider,Okay. Well that's interesting because you are 100% present on what your brain has decided to focus on what who is accused of not being 100% present was a you or was it you or someone else.
14547.0,Patient,pretty much against other people in my life.
105.0,Provider,"Okay, so they want your hundred percent attention. Okay, so we'll pick this up when we meet again and I do want to meet for a whole hour next time so make sure."
14547.0,Patient,yeah well.
105.0,Provider,"Hello so. This may have something to do with. accusation accusations that they're not getting their needs, met from you, because, for example, I find you are able to focus here quite well. And grounded it's only been about a half hour, but your eyes are this way and I have worked with people who have needed to get up leave and do and do and do and and our tangential and talk about 10 different things at or there's that painting oh geez that plant my hair this shirt so. i'm not seeing. you're in inability to focus, something has got your attention here you're either interested or you're something but you're you seem like you're attending to this conversation did it feel like that. yeah okay. Well, hold that with you as until the next time that we meet you actually are able to it's just. Once you do like, for example, right now, you're probably not thinking about the hundred other things are balls are dropping and there's deadlines and whatever. you're actually quite present and so when someone accuses you of not being present actually you're really good at it. it's just hold on that and now we'll get to how to communicate because, but first I want you to to fall more in love with yourself. To see that what you have is an amazing skill we've just got to harness that energy, be able to find little tricks and techniques okay okay sweetheart comes in, you say okay. i've got to write down. What I need to do in this project, here or i'm going to lose this you're going to learn some techniques about how you can respectfully. Really honor this natural attribute that you have in it, so that it's not a bad thing you're less likely to be angry when someone accuses you of it being bad. Okay, because once you turn your attention to her it's possible that if you're not arming yourself up trying to defend for the next attack. You, and this is where communication skills will come in handy you'll probably be able to say i'm I want to hear what you're saying i'm distracted by the yelling let's start over. And we can get there and we'll get into the the communication skills that I think will make a difference around that but, first, starting with see if you can have a little bit of change in I think what I do is pretty cool I get to really hyper focus, I can do it. we'll talk later about how you use space out as a way as a way to cope as a Defense mechanism we can we can get into that how the brain might be doing that. To keep you safe all right let's schedule another time. Looking. and, obviously, if you get a job you messaged me."
