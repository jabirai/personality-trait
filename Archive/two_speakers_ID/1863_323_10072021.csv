1863.0,Patient,There yeah.
323.0,Provider,"Sorry, we lost each other, I think it was money, and I think it cut out."
1863.0,Patient,"The House, and now I was like. Just like went to us during the man like what happened."
323.0,Provider,"yeah that was weird um. But what I was saying, is it was reminding me of when we were first meeting each other, and I was meeting both of you as a couple that you used to write your poems and stuff all the time. wow so you know, things are looking."
1863.0,Patient,I mean it's still like an adjustment to get used to like the hours of market and stuff like.
323.0,Provider,That yeah.
1863.0,Patient,"she's like at first is like felt alone and stuff like that, and I was like you know i'm at home right. Right like I don't like to travel anywhere, I was like the drive time I was like I don't have that I was like i'm at home, I was like I get a 15 minute paid break every two hours, I was like you can see me then I can come out and see you."
323.0,Provider,Right.
1863.0,Patient,And i'm.
323.0,Provider,"In the other room. yeah yeah good um. Are you were you did you get started on an antidepressant medication. No okay all right, I remember, at one point we were talking about it for both of you. I couldn't remember what was finally decided for you so you're just you're doing okay."
1863.0,Patient,"yeah for the most part, I mean i'd still like to have like depression. Times, I guess, where I don't know everything could be good, then all of a sudden, I just feel like really depressed and just like want to break down, but I don't tell her that."
323.0,Provider,And do not show that because you're afraid of the impact that will have on her.
1863.0,Patient,pretty much because I mean I know she struggles enough and I just don't want that extra burden I guess.
323.0,Provider,Are you seeing any difference because I thought there was going to be some medication changes for her to.
1863.0,Patient,uh yeah I mean she seems more. I don't know more. I guess okay. blathers like.
323.0,Provider,"Not staying in bed for days at a time. that's good good we don't want them. Okay, well, I mean if you feel like those moments I mean if they're just moments, we all have them if they're days and they kind of linger where you're just feeling kind of blah and sad and. tearful and."
1863.0,Patient,yeah sometimes it's like.
323.0,Provider,"overwhelmed, then the next time you have a medical appointment, I would encourage you to talk about what options, you might have. yeah because you don't have to suffer through that you know, there are some really good mentor that could help and it just sometimes just lifts a little bit so that you just feel better about your day."
1863.0,Patient,that'd be nice shirt there.
323.0,Provider,"Because right now, you have so much to be grateful and thankful for."
1863.0,Patient,"That whole day together, I guess, I think."
323.0,Provider,I mean seriously you when you change your mind you change the in dramatic ways and you make miracles happen.
1863.0,Patient,didn't have a choice. that's why I felt like anyway.
323.0,Provider,"Well, you got really tired."
1863.0,Patient,yeah.
323.0,Provider,"And then, at that point, the only way to go, was to go up."
1863.0,Patient,"No, I know more down I could get I don't think."
323.0,Provider,So you any you don't remind yourself of that because it's important to be proud of the successes you've had in these last several weeks.
1863.0,Patient,"yeah I mean like I told her, I was like you realize we just live in this place now, since all this setup. Not even two whole months. Right and I was like when we came here we didn't even have a couch to set on a bed to sleep on. was like now, we got a house full, why are we, like it. Were overcrowded with things now with like household stuff and like I got a job and it's it's crazy. How quick that term is."
323.0,Provider,"And you were in in your and i'm sure you're an inspiration to others too, but if we just use the example of your friend who came over at a low point. yeah what a story, you can share."
1863.0,Patient,"I mean there was times I reached out to them like even when I was like down and out and I he had a full time job working 60 hours a week. And I mean he probably I don't want to put words in his mouth, but. I know he probably could have spared a little bit of whatever to help me food something. And he never did but. I mean, I still help them out, and I was like well you know i'm still at friend I guess."
323.0,Provider,"cuz you're a different kind of person. Right, and you know what it felt like cuz you were just recently there."
1863.0,Patient,And that's what I don't think exactly like it only. For like 30 years.
323.0,Provider,"At the same time, you still want to have boundaries, you want to see somebody help themselves to."
1863.0,Patient,Right.
323.0,Provider,"You know, so you can always be there to catch it."
1863.0,Patient,"yeah that's what I tried to explain to him, I was like you're too nice sometimes."
323.0,Provider,And then she gets hurt.
1863.0,Patient,yeah yeah she does.
323.0,Provider,And that's the cycle that yeah we sometimes have to stop.
1863.0,Patient,Now I was like you just can't give everything you have a way and I was like because when you're down and stuff was like those people that you're helping won't be there to help you I was like you can't think that everybody's like that.
323.0,Provider,"uh huh. Well, you can be a great example and set some boundaries, when you know as people come knocking on your door true, and then you just say you know I wish I could, but I can't right now."
1863.0,Patient,"yeah I mean no, no, no, my My big thing is I can't if she makes her mind up to help somebody I can't tell her no for any thing ever. Like she spoiled I spoiler a lot."
323.0,Provider,"But what you can do is try to show her the example of when she gets hurt and say let's look at this together, not as blaming not, as I told you so. But just look at how this could have been different."
1863.0,Patient,yeah.
323.0,Provider,Maybe you have to do what you did.
1863.0,Patient,"yeah like I just imagine the shoes are, on the other, feet, would it be the same way, or would it still be one way and then having a different way."
323.0,Provider,Right and sometimes showing like remember where we were. How we were thinking that i'm up for us.
1863.0,Patient,"And kinda reminded her about my buddy toby I was like you remember when I reached out to him and we didn't have a lead, or anything like that, and I was like I messaged him he looked at my message, and not even reply back. Like he asked me for help, and I was like, but what we do, helping."
323.0,Provider,"You help them once you may not want to do that again, I mean you just think about."
1863.0,Patient,You want it and I don't.
323.0,Provider,Somebody start to help themselves too.
1863.0,Patient,"Right I don't I don't think he's on drugs cuz i've seen him on he was but I don't think he is, but then again the woman is with his wife now. She looks like she's on something again. And I told me, I was like I won't give you money, I was like if you need some food I don't have to buy some food. But I won't give you money."
323.0,Provider,"good for you that's setting up a boundary right there. And again, you know what it's like you've been there, so you know all the tricks in the book."
1863.0,Patient,yeah probably too many of them.
323.0,Provider,"So yeah I just i'm so thrilled and happy for you guys i'm really, really proud of your success."
1863.0,Patient,Thank you.

323.0,Provider,"All right, let me so i'm going to send a note this evening and asked, I don't know what the processes for, for I know what the processes to change therapist but i'm not sure about changing the physicians. So let me send a note and ask because. You and I are working together, I do work with Dr sell as well. She and I do an evening group on Wednesdays, and we do Saturday appointments so she and she has other evenings and stuff too, so I think that might just be an easier schedule. I will ask and try to get some information and hopefully want someone of us will reach out to you about it."
