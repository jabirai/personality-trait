He was so hard to shop for. kept trying to find him the ar 15 magazine he likes to read, but I didn't come out with the new issue before Christmas, so I just got him a little pocket juice charger and add a new DVD called the last duel that came out that my brother recommended so. Finally, got him taken care of last minute and everything out. yeah yeah it was really good, though, but my dad my dad had something really kind of embarrassing having his bridge fell out like he had three teeth fall out like right from here to here and. Like the day before Christmas, a couple days before and we were going to get a honey baked ham, but he couldn't he could barely he could barely to anything so we had we got pizza instead. So you know just little wrench in the dinner plans but. yeah you know and we got take out from Texas roadhouse and put it in the fridge for dinner. For Christmas. And like they got.

706.0,Provider,make yourself cancerous.
7489.0,Patient,yeah especially here in the front. And he went to the dentist yesterday and they couldn't even glue it back on. So he's going to have to like really have to see about getting like another bridge or some kind of something done. yeah.
706.0,Provider,"Well, I mean Christmases I mean people have all different dinners. Well, excuse me for Christmas, I mean Christmas Eve, we had pizza. So yeah a lot of people on Christmas Eve have pizza, in fact, you have to put your order at least around here really early if you want to eat pizza because there'll be so many people trying to get pizza that a certain time, they just stopped taking orders so. So yeah they mean it sounds like overall even with a little mishap with dinner everything went really well and you seem to be in a really good mood."
7489.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
706.0,Provider,"So over the holidays, did you feel triggered at all with like the stress or anything like that, did you feel triggered or have any."
7489.0,Patient,"Really um no, it was a happy time for me. It was good, it was good to see my family. You know I missed the ones that we didn't get see like my aunts and uncles Virginia West Virginia, but. hey you know I feel grateful that you know we have my brother and his wife here and my nephew years. They get to come down and see us and. You know the. yeah we have them close by."
706.0,Provider,"yeah no absolutely and it makes it really great when you get to see Christmas their children's eyes, you know it makes it. yeah because they still have all that magic and excitement, and you know it's it's just different I mean I know with my kids it's kind of that and we had it was a long Christmas, you know and. he's we have you know, we had our Christmas on Christmas Eve, and then we had Santa came some we had Christmas Day Plus we went to my husband's. family's on Christmas Day, and then we went to my family my mom and stuff the day after Christmas, and so I mean we just been kind of everywhere and."
7489.0,Patient,Three years later.
706.0,Provider,especially my little guy has. It over. It over abundance of toys that just won't I don't even know where they're going. I just.
7489.0,Patient,Everywhere right now.
706.0,Provider,"it's just there's no there's just no place to play it, I mean there's just so much stuff so I have to do some major rearranging and organizing so."
7489.0,Patient,yeah.
706.0,Provider,But I think every Christmas just kind of is that why there's just kind of a part of Christmas.
7489.0,Patient,Maybe it'll be a good opportunity to get rid of some old thanks.
706.0,Provider,"yeah no I didn't before Christmas, I took a. bunch of stuff to goodwill and donated it, but apparently was not enough because we definitely still have. Like I said kids are you know they're they just have a special way of looking at Christmas, you know."
7489.0,Patient,And about being.
706.0,Provider,"about the age of like three four they really get into it, so we mean he was. He was loving it, I mean every day for like three days it was, like all these presence to open he I don't even know what he's. Like now he wakes up in the morning and he's like wondering where his presence are like know that only happens. Only Christmas in your birthday kind of thing you know. The birthdays right before Christmas, so it just kind of. seems like non stop presence all the time. So yeah. You know he's just little so he enjoyed it but. that's me. And i'm sure with your nephews and stuff being there, I mean it was really awesome like watching them experience Christmas and open presents and."
7489.0,Patient,yeah there are six and 11 so it was definitely a. time of high excitement.
706.0,Provider,"And sometimes with the high excitement comes high stress, you know and it sounds like for you, that stress was like a good stress like it made you happy and excited and motivated and."
7489.0,Patient,yeah.
706.0,Provider,"Those kinds of things so that's good, because you know, in the past, before you were in recovery. Or maybe even in the time that you've you know, had been using math had you had a family get together like you had over Christmas. It would have been challenging for you, because you probably would have been under the influence or wanted to be under the influence and you know, maybe you would have felt the judgment and guilt from others around you. right because they knew that you were using or whatever, and then. really difficult because you feel like you're kind of an outsider."
7489.0,Patient,yeah or well you know that if I was using they might not have you income. So. yeah i'm just glad. i'm here and i'm playing and doing good and.
706.0,Provider,Did you make Christmas cookies.
7489.0,Patient,"know my sister in law makes the best sugar cookies in the world, so I left that up to her."
706.0,Provider,"yeah there you go. yeah I made I made Christmas cookies. I mean a couple of different things, and then I had Christmas cookies but. Am they're still sitting in the container that I made them and they didn't get frosted yaks I got so busy I didn't have a chance to pass them, so I have to fresh the sugar cookies but at least I attempted. will have Christmas cookies and tell me yours so that'll be good."
7489.0,Patient,We made to pumpkin pies so. yeah that's. That was our cooking attempt. We ordered a brownie and a cookie from pizza hut because we didn't get any other desserts.
706.0,Provider,"You know, whatever works like I said around the holidays you just. You know you kind of you have to go with the flow."
7489.0,Patient,But.
706.0,Provider,"Just stress yourself out, you know, and you know people. get really stressed out in the wanting to be perfect can like weddings you know, like you want to be so perfect and so you stress yourself out. and get yourself all crazy, but really I mean if it's not absolutely perfect, is it going to ruin the holiday it's not you know, like you know I you just kind of have to kind of pick and choose I guess your battles per se. You know everything's not going to turn out absolutely perfect when is it going to actually run the holiday know so you know you just kind of let it go let it roll off your shoulders."
7489.0,Patient,"I got a couple video games that are going to keep me busy, and here at home, too, so i'm not out like trying to shop and stuff. So. That that's going to help me a lot."
706.0,Provider,going.
7489.0,Patient,"Better better mom's still been just having me pick up stuff through the online places and if I go in anywhere I just don't take a purse and I even told mom about my failsafe method, I said, if you I said, if you get a call for me, and I say I just need to talk for a few minutes or something. it's because i'm in the store and I want to steal something. So I said don't be surprised if you get a call for me when i'm out somewhere, and I say I just need to talk for a few minutes, and you know. I said I was talking with my counselor and we were working on a safety plan for me to not be stealing things. You know, I just wanted to share it with her today so she knew I was working on things, and you know she'd feel a little more at ease about me going out to. And that way she can feel like she's helping to."
706.0,Provider,mm hmm.
7489.0,Patient,cuz I know she wants to be part of the solution to.
706.0,Provider,Oh absolutely. yeah and how do you think they did she have a good reaction to that.
7489.0,Patient,"Oh yeah she said, Sarah you can call me anytime."
706.0,Provider,"Good so she was really supportive. Definitely that's awesome. So. So your safety plan you initiated and you talk to your mom so that hold you accountable, because I knew let her know hey I have the safety plan. So if you don't follow through and then you do something like steal something, then you can be held accountable like widen geez your safety plan you told me that you were going to call me why didn't you call me, and I think that that's really important. And then also to be able to identify at those times, where you're feeling like hey I want sharp left. um what why why you know, like what are those feelings What are those thoughts and that's why we talked about that journaling like when you have that sense of you need that rash or that feeling or you know that sense of hey I got away with that and that feeling of kind of. Energy but it's negative energy. Know like what's going through your head, you know what are you feeling, what are you thinking. What triggered that those kinds of things because that's what we need to identify in order to work towards not doing those things if that makes sense."
7489.0,Patient,"So. yeah I mean it can be anything honestly that can put me into doing it, I mean I can be I can be stressed uh, but it can be to i'm having a good day i'm having a bad day it can be. You know I had a fight with mom it can be. i'm depressed or it can be i'm really happy. Or it can just be i'm in there and I I see something you know, and it can be an impulse thing. You know. It it can be premeditated or an impulse thing. it's just it's just a huge issue."
706.0,Provider,"Well, it has a lot to do with replacing the feeling of you thing with. That same feeling but you're getting it from something else I mean and so that's why you know, identifying so you said they called me me my mom and I got in a fight Okay, so your mom and you get in a fight and that triggers you."
7489.0,Patient,Typically.
706.0,Provider,"for you to want to use, but now it triggers you want to shop left. What is that. What is that shoplifting going to do for you like what what is that feeling it's going to give you what is it what is the benefit to shoplifting in that situation."
7489.0,Patient,um it gives you that rush and then. I have new stuff which kind of makes me happy. Okay.
706.0,Provider,"So after you do the shoplifting and that rush wears off because it wears off, just like with any drug your rush wears off. Right feeling worse off than what then were you at."
7489.0,Patient,Then I just have new stuff and. Probably in the same spot.
706.0,Provider,So.
7489.0,Patient,mom yeah and you still feel bad about the fight with mom and dad didn't go away.
706.0,Provider,"Right, so now think back to when you used, you know, so you would use because something will trigger you to use and use and and after you use for a while you feel great you have that. That sense of excitement, you have that rush, you have kind of that whatever was making you upset doesn't exist at the moment, you know, like you're too caught up in that moment of everything else. When it wears off and the drugs come out of your system. Then what. Then Where are you at."
7489.0,Patient,right back where you started.
706.0,Provider,"So do you see the similarities, do you see that you're you're going through the same patterns. Basically, using shoplifting whatever it may be to get that feeling and to escape for a moment."
7489.0,Patient,But once that.
706.0,Provider,"you're right back where you started and so it's more so it's like it's it's a Defense mechanism you're escaping something, but then you come right back to it so it's not solving the issue it's just post. So. Instead of being triggered to, for instance, go shop left what would be something you could do in replacement of that that maybe potentially could help you."
7489.0,Patient,In this doesn't really exercise. If I can channel like if I get pissed off or something if I could channel that anger into exercise oh my God.
706.0,Provider,"So. So what about let's say like you get angry. And maybe you leave the House and you go for a walk. You know yeah first things like okay I just need to get away, I need to escape because that's going to get that escape part you know. I missed a break for a few minutes gotta get away."
7489.0,Patient,Right.
706.0,Provider,"You come back you'll probably be a little bit more calm, because even except you know you have exceeded that energy that negative energy, but your mind is still going to be chaotic So then, when you get back what can you do to help the situation, so your mind isn't chaotic."
7489.0,Patient,"um. I can try playing my video game to relax or. I got a new book called palm palm pokemon you take it you take yarn and you make your own little POM poms and. You make them into pokemon. it's it's really cute. that's cool. I went mom bought me some yarn last night. She ordered it on walmart and let me go pick it up and the little POM POM maker she got it for me at join works and Let me pick it up there, they even have curbside service."
706.0,Provider,"Every place does anymore after the pandemic, which is nice. I know it's so nothing has gotten really lazy. Go to a store you just order it on and drive up and they bring it to you it's gotten really lazy."
7489.0,Patient,"yeah but it's it's it's nice for my situation right now, it really, really."
706.0,Provider,Perfect because you don't even have just to stop looking store.
7489.0,Patient,"yeah yeah and. It makes things really nice right now. it's still all is tempting. But yeah so i'm you know i'm trying to look into doing like crafty little things, or you know just. trying to find stuff to do at the House like you know. i've got a backlog of laundry. If. There was a while there if I didn't get my laundry done in time my parents would load it into trash bags and just throw it in the back bedroom. So I could never find my clothes, so I would just go steal new stuff to wear. So there are probably like five or six trash bags of clothes, that I need to wash in the back bedroom. That. I haven't seen even what's in them, and probably like a year or two. I know I unpacked one of them. Last time I was doing laundry and then I found some cool stuff in there."
706.0,Provider,"I think I even have this. What I want you to. Work on before we meet again is if you're upset anxious your mom and you get in a fight, whatever it may be, I want you to go do something physical go for a walk. it's obviously colder snow, you can want go outside and go for a walk but you could just."
7489.0,Patient,hey I can take my dog to rural king and walk them around their. Big pet store pet smart. yeah you. know people walking around there. Fine.
706.0,Provider,"i'm solving. yeah yeah. No yeah no that's awesome so yeah do something like that, and then I want you to come home and then figure out the the mental chaos, so you can focus refocus your head to do something productive but eventually, you have to come back to that problem and solve it. So once you're once you're feeling a little bit more calm and kind of centered with yourself, I want you to try and figure out how to solve it, whether you know, maybe sit down and journal, how you feel about the situation and then think about okay. i'm in a better place i'm more calm, is it something that I can go and talk to mom about can we solve this issue you know, like. We had a fight if I go talk to her, can we solve it, you know, whatever the fight is about is that you know, is it something that you just have to come to grips with like and hold accountability like I messed up I realized why moms mad. Right, you know I like or you know I haven't done my laundry in two months, I understand why moms man. You know, like whatever it may be. And then is it that you need to go to her and be like you know what mom i'm sorry that we got in a fight about this you're right like this isn't right, I need to change this, I apologize. You know, is it something like that you know, is it something that maybe your mom and you just don't agree on and you just need to agree to disagree, but yet you need to have that conversation of. You know mom I really don't agree with your opinion, just like you don't agree with mine but let's just agree to disagree, because I don't want to fight anymore."
7489.0,Patient,Right.
706.0,Provider,"You know, you know so that way you come to a place of peace, you know that you've solved the you've solved the issue, or at least attempted to. Rather than just run away and avoid it and bottle it inside and still keep those feelings inside, because then eventually they come out and sometimes they come out negative ways."
7489.0,Patient,yeah and we don't like to go to bed angry around here so. We always try to. You know figure out things before the end of the day.
706.0,Provider,"yeah so that's what I want you to work on before we meet the next time is kind of that step process because we're working on, obviously. Maintaining your mental health, as well as your recovery so in order to do that, you have to have those pieces of you know, being able to problem solve being able to use coping skills and so that all falls into that so it's I feel this way. Rather than do something negative like shoplifting or drugs i'm going to go something physical to get out that negative energy. Then i'm going to do something mental to Center me, so I can problem solve the issue then i'm going to go and i'm going to implement that so that it starts to solve the problem, or of the problem can be solved just agree to disagree."
7489.0,Patient,That sounds good.
706.0,Provider,yeah that's what I want you to work on before the next session because then you're you're you know you're kind of doing that okay do with how I feel think about what the problem is try and problem solve that.
7489.0,Patient,And those are the.
706.0,Provider,"steps that you need to take at any time in life when something is happening, that is not. You know, making you feel good, whether it be something making you mad or sad or even something that's making you like really like almost manic like really happy. it's almost that Okay, you need to calm yourself down Sarah go get rid of some of that energy calm yourself down Center yourself okay. it's awesome that you're really happy and it's okay to feel happy and exhilarated but that doesn't mean that you have to go find a rush somewhere to enhance that just really feeling of being happy and excited. So so yeah and you mean you're doing great you know, like I said, you know we will you were so close before to going through discharge and his we just you can't medicate methamphetamines you know and that's I. told you like, I just wanted to be really bluntly, you know, we want to help you Sarah, but there is not enough medication in the world. That we think. That the methamphetamines out of you, you know you're still going to have all these health issues, because the methamphetamines are finding any drug that we can give you and. Once you did that and started working towards you know. That piece of recovery, I mean you've made a complete turnaround and you've got a job and your family is you know proud of you, and you got to spend time with your brother and your nephews. With no guilt like there's no guilt there because you weren't doing wrong things you were just enjoying them."
7489.0,Patient,yeah i've got a friend who's it's it's actually. My last best friend I have left and she's so strung out on us. and You know I don't see her often because I know I can't help her.
706.0,Provider,She will make you relapse before you'll get her into recovery.
7489.0,Patient,Exactly and that's why I don't try to see her.
706.0,Provider,mm hmm.
7489.0,Patient,"Because I know and it's it's hard, because I love her and but she's about as big around as a twig and. She I don't know i'm really worried about her lately because she told me she like I text her and check on her. But she told me she switched from suboxone or methadone for no reason, except, except that the guy she lives with her ex boyfriend. goes to the methadone clinic and like it's not easier for her to find a ride from here to Columbus every day, then it is for her to find a ride to her weekly suboxone appointment every day. So I don't know why she did it. And she told me she she didn't make it up there one day, and she did fenton all and then. siri it scares the crap out of me yeah so i've just been really brand for."
706.0,Provider,me. You know that's all you can do is you know pray for her.
7489.0,Patient,is to.
706.0,Provider,"distance yourself from her because, like I said she'll make you relapse before you put her injury every and. And it's hard it's hard to cut those ties, but you have to put your recovery first, you have to. Make priority."
7489.0,Patient,"yeah we've we've both had to do it with each other over the years. I mean, because it seems like every time one of us gets clean the other one not mm hmm and we have to stop talking to each other and it always sucks. But that's just the way it is and. You know i've told her. If she wants help. She knows where i'm at mm hmm."
706.0,Provider,"yeah I mean, and then you need to direct her to a place that can help her."
7489.0,Patient,yeah oh yeah I wouldn't try to. do so for anything.
706.0,Provider,"No, you can't you can't put yourself in a situation."
7489.0,Patient,I tried to get her into a domestic violence shelter or rehab place. Because the place she lives is horrible.
706.0,Provider,"Oh, speaking of friends the neighbor across the street, did you take over the gift card and introduce yourself."
7489.0,Patient,"Oh, my mom just got the card fixed up and just gave me the gift card. I I have it all fixed up and i'm going to take it over so I was going to take it over yesterday, actually, but I had some errands sure on and I didn't get back until like 845 and I was afraid that it was too late to take it over so i'm going to try to take it over today."
706.0,Provider,"Okay, good."
7489.0,Patient,But yeah i've got the card all fixed up so.
706.0,Provider,"All right, well, we are at a time, Sarah, but I want you to work on those Problem Solving goals before I see you again. And then I will see you in group tomorrow or actually I would say you i'll see you next Monday."

7489.0,Patient,"We. Just had like a real short run with Julie, just to get our message."
706.0,Provider,"Oh, because. They said they were going to message everybody and let them know that we weren't having group, and they were going to just bring your men, so that was something different, that they must have done."
7489.0,Patient,They didn't tell us.
706.0,Provider,"Okay, so there was a message sent out okay."
7489.0,Patient,Does I must have not told Julie either.
706.0,Provider,"Well yeah that's so weird okay I don't know what happened because I actually had. A patient messaged me that said that they didn't realize that we weren't having group and now they're having trouble with their mad, so I don't know. anyways it's will have to just figure it out individual individual by individual but i'm glad that you got to see Julian get your month at least. yeah okay yeah."

706.0,Provider,"Sarah simpkins long term goal maintainer mental health, as well as her recovery goals that she'll be working towards before next session include. At the time that she's feeling some kind of stressor or even exhilaration from being happy, whatever it may be to channel that energy into something like physical activity going for a walk taking her dog for a walk. And then, when she comes back to try and send receptor herself to work on the problem to journal it out to think about how to problem solve it. And then also following that when she feels like she's in a good place then she will try and implement that, whether that be. For example, getting into an argument with her mom that caused her stress being able to try and problem solve that issue with her mom after she has taken some time to kind of re Center herself. So that she is in a better state to be able to deal with it."
