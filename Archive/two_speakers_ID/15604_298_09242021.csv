I remember taking a big big puffers stuff. down here in the US. zero dollars and then call me Should I be grateful. i'm alive. I want you to know something, because it could be a bad man he might be able to begin the process of incorporating this into any kind of treatment program that you jump into. The money I get every month is retirement money from. But for seven or eight years, for I was given the same amount of money. I was being treated for anxiety and panic. I think they began quite a while, before I actually some treatment for the. and beyond my and is it about what I need to go through to begin this process, the withdrawal symptoms very concerned about. That thing because my level of anxiety was you know prevalence of the worst pain, I can imagine seconds men see my hours today and I was in my mind. I don't know it's really yet where God. I have some real. Personal issues coming from different directions so. I won't bore you with the details, but."
298.0,Provider,"i'm so i'm wondering if you would do better, for the first week to go on buprenorphine alone, and not the naloxone added. Would you want to try that."
15604.0,Patient,what's the last Sunday or solution. is number one the opiate problem.
298.0,Provider,"Yes, and then the lock sewn is the Blocker."
15604.0,Patient,Perfect this one.
298.0,Provider,"And, but we only do that for one week to get you. On to the drug okay right. Okay, do you have any medication allergies. Okay, what happened, the consequences of your drug use."
15604.0,Patient,everything bad in my life that has or hasn't happened and I will emphasize that has an APP and the thing is that should have happened is do the drums.
298.0,Provider,mm hmm.
15604.0,Patient,"I mean I should be a millionaire. I was well on my way out a very, very glamorous talking about. A very, very glamorous career or made quite a bit of money, I was basically paid that front, I was a sales engineer and learned a lot of technical information. Related to communications hardware. So I covered large geographic regions at a job for five or six years where i've covered Oregon Washington Alaska selling a very unique and wonderful product. To. Top fortune 500 companies both ship oh."
298.0,Provider,wow. yeah what's motivating motivating what is motivating you right now to want to get on to suboxone who've been our thing.
15604.0,Patient,"I want to. i'm 67. saga Nice that it's just amazing some religious person by god's grace and extremely good now, all things considered. boy bored to tears some more money. daughter daughter that I care about very much as any hope of. Restructuring my life and going forward in some fashion. and doing the things I should do for my daughter is not going to happen if i'm on drugs."
298.0,Provider,As.
15604.0,Patient,"Part of. My treatment program that's why i'm trying to tell you, is, I need to medicate my way some fashion, through this anxiety is anxious about you know so okay i'm very, very anxious about getting through the initial let's call it week to 10 day adjustment that. will come with going on the suboxone for the dead serious about. about changing my life and interactions that are just spoke about. need to. Take care of the things I wish, so an opiate replacement, yes, the man you describe, is a blessing. I can see. But. i'll just have to see how it goes, but I know that design is going to be a huge issue for me and. Whereas the opiate replacement thing is a different level on it. I need to be prescribed something lots of trust, because, as it tries to tell you. I. period periods of anxiety, I went through were. As painful as any pain, I can imagine. And the thing is i'm not I don't feel I didn't feel and have felt in my life depressed and I don't know whether it's just some mental trick I plan on myself or whatever, but you know i've I have been prescribed antidepressants and I just don't see a need for them just."
298.0,Provider,Greg. um any medication allergies any medical problems that you know up your heart your lungs.
15604.0,Patient,A large prostate. Okay that's a big problem.
298.0,Provider,Is.
15604.0,Patient,best described by the doctor I worked with the suboxone previously and she gave me prostate medications like phone I say bring her up because she also prescribed me. A particular drug that was very effective for the anxiety it's called to as a restaurant or as a bouncer.
298.0,Provider,"Okay, I can't help you with those kind of meds I know that i'm a psychiatric but that's not what this program is but I agree that you do need to get out because that's an underlying issue of your usage."
15604.0,Patient,"I I will find a way to get high well or door to treat my anxiety. Regardless be above and beyond my desire my frame for opiates which hopefully. I mean currently I you know. I think, to my mind, a $20 a day. What. Did you do that, then it also educates my anxiety. When I feel anxious or I can sleep I do go to the street and buy one once or twice a week. Just one. So I guess the same. However, it happens if this program is going to be successful and see me where I want to go or assume you want to take it as well. Please give me some direction to to. anxiety yeah I gave you that car down down. down for your Gal. So it's. Very harm reduction. I think you're sitting there a standard yeah I thought you put in, it should be written behind one."
298.0,Provider,"Okay, so I am writing your prescription now I need to go over some of the side effects with you have this medicine."
15604.0,Patient,Okay.
298.0,Provider,So it can upset your stomach and how you use this medicine is nothing in your mouth 15 minutes before or 15 minutes after put it under your.
15604.0,Patient,15 months.
298.0,Provider,war or after. You put the little tablet.
15604.0,Patient,Under your time for that part but therefore i'm eating.
298.0,Provider,know the tablet.
15604.0,Patient,You don't you don't drink or eat for 15 minutes.
298.0,Provider,"Okay, let it completely."
15604.0,Patient,yeah.
298.0,Provider,"Let it let it completely dissolve the longer you can leave it in your mouth up to 15 minutes, the more it's going to be absorbed through your body, so you can swallow it but it's not going to do that much in your stomach it's all absorbed through your mouth."
15604.0,Patient,Right and I do remember. One day how big it yeah. He chased it so.
298.0,Provider,yeah. It does.
15604.0,Patient,I enjoy. The sounds of. Coffee syrah.
298.0,Provider,yeah.
15604.0,Patient,"yeah, I would like. description I don't know what you're writing for usage in the morning and another one later and."
298.0,Provider,"that's what I just wrote for, and it can put you into withdrawals, so the longer that you don't use minimum 12 hours, but if you can go 24 hours, even better, without using it's easier for your body to get."
15604.0,Patient,"I. Should you say the medication you're giving me. Is without the op and blocking or yeah so, so why why you want to withdraw I was trying to explain. The suboxone is is also like part of like like the suboxone is what puts you in a buprenorphine will put your camera. So it does. It does yes."
298.0,Provider,"Glenn i'm gonna leave any instruction with him i've got to go right now, I have another appointment and if. you're welcome and I sent your prescription to the pharmacy and i'll see you next Thursday between 11 and one."
