480.0,Provider,Hello. how's it going.
15238.0,Patient,work.
480.0,Provider,"You just got off yeah. I don't know how you do it, you take NAPs though during the night right."
15238.0,Patient,"um yeah like I have to get up every two hours. Okay, oh I get like an hour. Every two hours like."
480.0,Provider,You do three nights a week.
15238.0,Patient,"So my schedule actually changed now so like I went in on at 9am Monday morning and I got off at seven this morning and I just got home and then I go back. At 9am again today, and then i'll get off tomorrow at 7am."
480.0,Provider,"OK, so the days when you're not working at someone's house, do you sleep a full night, are you still waking up every hour."
15238.0,Patient,Because I still wake up. yeah yeah my body's trying to do that.
480.0,Provider,yeah that's tough.
15238.0,Patient,I don't get very much sleep. Have you ever.
480.0,Provider,"Like i'm not. i'm not usually a big fan of like pushing meds but with sleep, I feel like it's a little different you ever take anything that night your home to help."
15238.0,Patient,"Well i've tried melatonin and it doesn't work at all for me, not at all, and then they had me on seroquel for a while, before I started with you guys and that would make me so in a fog the next."
480.0,Provider,Day yeah.
15238.0,Patient,"That I really couldn't even function very well, so I get off of that."
480.0,Provider,"I was thinking like a tragedy, or something which is. An anti anxiety, a lot of people, you can take a low dose and you don't feel hung over the next day. uh huh um but maybe something to mention, too, is chantel your provider now. yeah Okay, maybe something to mentioned to her if that's something that bothers you because I know sleep really."
15238.0,Patient,"Well, as I can, like even when I saw how this whole weekend off I have sat on Friday I get off at five and then I don't go back to work so Monday. But even when i'm off for those three days like i'm so antsy. yeah like I can't because i'm so used to being so busy. yeah that even when i'm home i'm like. Going crazy like I can't just relax."
480.0,Provider,"Well, and that was something that I noticed with the transit home because i've been on and off of it for a long time, like i'll go on for a couple months and then i'll go off of it. And when I am it using the transit own my anxiety throughout the day is way lower because technically it's an Anti anxiety meds it's just. It just makes you really tired. So that might even help because you don't have to take it every night it's not a medicine that you have to take every night you just take one. Nice, if you only get on weekends, when you were home. That might even help with the anxiety throughout the day too."
15238.0,Patient,"Oh yeah cuz I like even my daughter, and my husband are always like can you just stop like can you sit down coming and i'm like I I tried. I honestly it's, not that I don't want to because. My body's exhausted. But it just my body won't let me."
480.0,Provider,So how are things with husband.
15238.0,Patient,"Good good we've been doing good. We kind of have left it to i'm not gonna invest myself at all into his family. So. No it's just like it just causes fights between us, because, like, I feel like that's his family so that's his place like. And if it was my family I would be I should be the one that's talking to my family and he's. He doesn't see it that way, he was like i'm not going to get into my sister's drawing with you and i'm like Okay, but if I say something to your sister it's gonna go around completely different than what was really said and it's just going to cause more problems so. i'm like i'm in a no win situation here like you don't want to deal with it cuz to you it's girl drama i'm like, but if I stand up for myself to your sister then it's gonna get so twisted that everyone's gonna hate me again. yeah so i'm like I just don't want to be involved anymore like i'm and he was like well you want it i'm like yeah I didn't want it, I go, but even now it's they're not really genuine."
480.0,Provider,"Right and that's The difference is you crave having a family, but you don't necessarily crave connection with his family, because of how they are in their personalities. So there's those are things."
15238.0,Patient,"very bad very like it's it's so crazy they just lie so much and i'm like. i'm just not a fake person. yeah it's really hard for me to smile at you. When I know you're talking crap about me like I can't i'm not that person so it's really hard, because that whole family's like that, like they all talk crap about each other behind their backs they all are nice and SMILEY to each other's faces and i'm like. it's it's really toxic free so i'm like dude this is hell like. yeah I can literally know that you guys have all sat there and talked about each other and now you're all sitting there playing games together like. i'm just I can't deal with that, like it's just too much for me and causes. me to have major anxiety to be around it."
480.0,Provider,yeah absolutely.
15238.0,Patient,"that's The point is, because, like, I will say like like I told him like i'm not gonna let your sister disrespect me. i'm like that's not gonna happen and he's like well if you say something you're not gonna be welcomed anymore and i'm like i'm not gonna go off on her. I go but i'm just not gonna allow that like that wasn't that's not okay she's not allowed to call me names she's not allowed to put me down and, in all honesty, she has no right to get in our business anyway. Like our relationship, our relationship and I don't really like that. Your whole family gets involved in it. And so. Like I."
480.0,Provider,"Do they get involved, like they try to tell him to get rid of you."
15238.0,Patient,"Oh, they have plenty of times um but no like so i've never had a wedding ring in 22 years. ever so for Christmas, he said that he would get me in the ring that I chose. And so there was a big misunderstanding, with the doors, because the jeweler was telling me that the ring was able to be ordered already because it had to be custom made. And they were telling him that it wasn't, so we are getting cross communication. So I was getting really frustrated i'm like if you don't want to buy the ring like i'm fine with you know buying them but don't tell me you're gonna buy it so we got into this huge fight over it. And a sister like called me and was like you're childish and you're greedy, and this and that and i'm like whoa i'm like I don't even know where you're coming at me like that for but. You don't know the whole story, and she was like you want this and you want that one, like everything I have i've worked for my."
480.0,Provider,business.
15238.0,Patient,"I know, but I was like your brother has never given me shit yeah i'm like so I don't know where you're coming out me being greedy i'm like. I go I don't even care about getting the ring it's the point that he said he was gonna get it, and he should follow through are not just telling me don't make up excuses. And she's like she's like you just expect too much from my brother, and so I hung up on her i'm like you know why you don't want to listen to what and she like flipped out she like told me, I was reading the I tch that I was a gold digger and i'm like. yeah."
480.0,Provider,You have. Jobs and he doesn't work.
15238.0,Patient,"yeah I know and i'm like oh my God, are you kidding me, and I think i'm better than everybody and i'm like and i'm into my husband like how do I feel like i'm better than anybody I."
480.0,Provider,know. You are better than that. much help.
15238.0,Patient,know I know I go and I. Am better than every single one of your family members.
480.0,Provider,yeah.
15238.0,Patient,"i'm like I don't see kids like crap I don't you know cause problems for no reason but. yeah so we just ended it if it has to involve his family, unless I go up here for holidays or whatever, but i'm not gonna help out i'm not gonna invest my. I was just dumbfounded I was really cuz like I do want a new SUV. But I still on my car that I have. And so I would need him to co sign for us to get the car. Okay, he has better credit so that's why she told me, I was a gold digger cuz she's like oh you're not even happy with the ring you want my brother to buy you a brand new car and i'm like there's a difference between buying you on and co signing, so I get a better loan rate. A my God never once asked him to make a payment for me."
480.0,Provider,Ever yep.
15238.0,Patient,"yeah they. use in their head yeah it is it's like. You can literally tell them something, and they will go back and it will never be anything close to what you say."
480.0,Provider,"it's insane I just like I don't know i'm every time I talk to you i'm just shocked at how you've been able to put up with it, as long as you have."
15238.0,Patient,"It. I know I don't even get it like I don't and it's weird to me because, even in my family. Like I have cousins that have been married four or five times like they don't put up with men's prep at all. Like, and these are the cousins I grew up as my sister's like they just don't deal with that, so I don't know I don't know why I have not walked away, to be honest, like it's not it's not something that I watched growing on."
480.0,Provider,"Right well and I, but like we've talked about before you so desperately wanted a family unit so for a long time that made you blind to how toxic everything really was. And then, by that time you're in it with a kid it's what you know, like there's a reason that. there's a reason that's not entirely. you're doing you know what I mean like a lot of it was trauma responses from stuff that happened in childhood, even though that wasn't modeled to you, I actually this is interesting i'm going to share this with you because it just thought this morning um. Let me see if I can find it. OK, so the four different trauma responses we talked about flight fight freeze, but then there's fun so there's four different trauma responses flight is workaholic over thinker anxiety panic OCD difficulty sitting still perfectionist. Fight comes out as anger outbursts controlling the bully narcissistic and explosive behavior. freeze is difficulty making decisions you feel stuck you dissociate and you isolate and then fine, is the people pleaser a lack of identity, no boundaries overwhelmed codependent so it makes sense because you have all four of these responses and."
15238.0,Patient,Different just gonna say. Every one of those.
480.0,Provider,"Exactly, and I think a lot of people do a lot of people have a combination, especially people that have had multiple traumas not just like one you know what I mean yeah so. I think that's where you have to give yourself some grace for tolerating it as long as you have because you didn't know how unhealthy, it was in the beginning, because it was serving your illusion of needs, because of the trauma responses right. So now, all you can do is exactly what you're doing set the healthy boundaries, so that you take care of yourself, first and foremost, instead of people pleasing taking care of them and abandoning you."
15238.0,Patient,"yeah that's, so it is hard, but I did actually put my foot down last week to about that because I got i'd worked 13 hours and I told my husband before I go home i'm like I am extremely hungry and tired. he's like okay well i'll make this when I got home he had even had dinner already. And I was kind of pissed off about that because i'm like dude I literally just worked 13 hours and you're sitting in the driveway working on your project truck."
480.0,Provider,yeah that would that's a justifiable reason to be angry.
15238.0,Patient,"I did, like, I was like you know, usually I wouldn't say nothing and just let it go but i'm like no that's not okay anymore."
480.0,Provider,Godfrey.
15238.0,Patient,"Did he got mad for me saying something, but then I think afterwards, like the next day he kind of noticed it, but he was still kind of a brad about it because he was like Oh, let me make sure I have dinner for you, so you don't throw a fit."
480.0,Provider,"huh yeah. See Okay, and with him. that's progress for sure, even though he still feels the need to be passive aggressive at least he's recognizing that that's not fair, I should have like it's a it's a really messed up way to apologize, but I feel like that's his version."
15238.0,Patient,"of an apology yeah it is he doesn't he will never flat out tell you sorry. yeah never like he'll either act like nothing happened and try to be extra Nice, the next day or do something, but yeah i've never really heard him honestly say i'm sorry for very much in our whole relationship."
480.0,Provider,wow that's crazy yeah.
15238.0,Patient,"he's just not, I think the only thing that he said, like straight out that he was sorry for when he got sober was that he used to beat me."
480.0,Provider,Okay.
15238.0,Patient,"But I think that was more like. I don't think it was so much for me, I think it was one of his steps you know, like. Trying to make amends."
480.0,Provider,Oh for sure.
15238.0,Patient,yeah he's been sober for over eight years old.
480.0,Provider,Oh wow does he still do a or anything.
15238.0,Patient,"um no not all the time, but our church has a meeting so if he. feels anxious, or like antsy about something will go up there and talk to me because it's like so in the beginning it's women and men, but when you break out to your actual like time then it's just men so."
480.0,Provider,Oh cool okay.
15238.0,Patient,yeah it is and i'm so i've even talked about doing couples counseling but he wants to do it with someone that's to a church and i'm like well that's not fair because.
480.0,Provider,They know.
15238.0,Patient,"The person that you want us to go to is your counselor for your group so they've already been put into like your version of everything that's happened i'm Like you, we need to go to somebody that neither one of us and talk to her seen so."
480.0,Provider,"Yes, that is. that's the thing like if the counselor at the Church is ethical he won't see you guys as a couple because, like I wouldn't see you guys as a couple I would. You if if you needed support for something and wanted to bring him in for a session, that would be appropriate, but it wouldn't be appropriate for me to couples counsel because I didn't know your side."
15238.0,Patient,yeah and that's what I tell him like and he even tells me he he gets mad about counting he's like he's like all you do is bad mouth us like he's like you don't tell the whole story i'm like I tell my version of how things appear to me. Right like that's what counseling is i'm like your version of what the same situation is going to be different. yeah i'm like but. You can't tell me that my counseling isn't working because you don't even have any clue to what we actually all talked about right.
480.0,Provider,"Exactly exactly, and I think, just so you know which i'm sure you do already when you tell me things you also tell me your part in things which leads me to believe it's a more accurate description right i'm sure when he goes and."
15238.0,Patient,doesn't mean that. He doesn't think that I take accountability for what I do wrong.
480.0,Provider,"Well, I can vouch for that."
15238.0,Patient,He just I mean I don't know he.
480.0,Provider,He probably thinks that because he doesn't take accountability yeah right yeah.
15238.0,Patient,"Like every time I even like trying to put a boundary down it's always like. don't take your aggression out on me to deal with your childhood your childhood issues that's why things don't work out with us that's why we fight and i'm like you're right, I do have childhood issues but for 22 years you and your family have been the trauma and the issues. So."
480.0,Provider,that's exactly right he's not understanding that he's triggering all of these issues because his behavior is very similar.
15238.0,Patient,So.
480.0,Provider,"Yes, you're having. No."
15238.0,Patient,yeah he doesn't understand that.
480.0,Provider,"And that's why i'm like couples counselor would be beneficial, because if I said that. He might get mad, but he would at least start to hear it from someone other than you."
15238.0,Patient,"Oh, even even when he hears it he he'll tell me I don't even listen to nobody. Like he doesn't want to hear that he has any fault in anything like it's always a give I spaz out it's because I can't control my anger if. I get upset and emotional and start crying it's because i'm too sensitive like it's never. Like there's no getting through to him really yeah like and I don't even know couples counseling would even help but either because he's in such denial, he think honestly he thinks he's one of the greatest men on this earth."
480.0,Provider,that's unfortunate.
15238.0,Patient,"I know, but, and I mean like I do love him and I do care about them, but I might do you have way too many faults, like everyone has faults i'm not saying that but. Like and even when he'll say he'll be like oh you're lucky to have me or this or that or you'd be nothing without me and i'm like. Okay."
480.0,Provider,"delusional but okay. yeah Okay, so when you when you talk about things going well, and I assume you're staying at his house more."
15238.0,Patient,Right yeah I mean basically for. The last three nights.
480.0,Provider,"Okay, so when things are going better Do you still in your mind want to leave when your daughter's graduated or is this like hope for it potentially working out permanently like where does your mind go I."
15238.0,Patient,"mean I would I would love for it to. work out permanently, but that is not out of my mind. Right like I don't because it's weird cuz even though things go good like we do have our fights and arguments, but. Like i'm always still waiting for the other shoe to drop."
480.0,Provider,"Like which is. A good thing like Sometimes I feel like that's a bad thing, but in your situation I think that's your intuition just. letting you know, like hey."
15238.0,Patient,yeah.
480.0,Provider,You know from past experience something's going to happen eventually so.
15238.0,Patient,"Well yeah cuz even he even told me he's like I don't know why you've been paying rent where you're at you're always here. And i'm like. whoa because when you get mad at me, you told me to get the hell out of your House like yeah. it's kind of like a safety thing, and until I feel and I i've told him that i'm like I don't really feel like this is my home you've never even let me feel that. yeah like every time we get an argument every time we have a disagreement it's your House it's yours it's not ours it's not you know it's it's always This is my house, this is my stuff this is. Like and that's not how a relationship should be."
480.0,Provider,"To be honest, not at all."
15238.0,Patient,"So we have a hard time with that, right now, like i've tried to express that like that our relationship is not a partnership. Like i'm like your stuff is your stuff and that's it I go, but you know, I have to take care of our daughter like 90% of it, you get 10 i'm like I work two jobs and you still expect me to come home and cook and clean and. run all the errands for our daughter and do everything on like that you have, I am a lot of stress that I shouldn't have to deal with because you're supposed to be my partner you're supposed to be your daughter's Father like that's not fair and I don't know I just. I don't get it, but like I think a lot of it has to do with his culture, because even his mom was homeless like Oh, I worked, I did you know I did seem interesting and I want the kids to him from school and me i'm like okay well that's good that's. Right that's that's still doesn't make it okay like. that's not how it's supposed to be yeah, but I think that's just their beliefs and that's that's really hard for me because. I wasn't growing up like."
480.0,Provider,"That and it's hard for anybody, given the fact that it's 2022 now right like they live in America and it's 2022 so. that's, the problem is that if you're clinging so hard to your cultural values that are now outdated around the world, not just in America, then you're going to have problems living your life successfully. And that's a perfect example like he's never going to have a healthy relationship with anybody. Until he's willing to look at the fact that maybe how he was raised and the thoughts and ideas he has about relationships about. housework about different gender roles they have to change if he wants to have a healthy relationship with somebody and that's the part where i'm hearing you say he's not willing to change so. I don't think a relationship with him is sustainable, with you, continuing to grow and do work, I think, like. can make it make it work for a period of time, but you're never going to be happy in the relationship."
15238.0,Patient,"yeah and that's why, like, I mean I hate to say that, and I think he knows it too cuz he's always said, oh you're here just for convenience it's nothing as convenient because it's really."
480.0,Provider,Not it's there for you.
15238.0,Patient,yeah but I really feel like if my daughter my daughter state for college I would probably.
480.0,Provider,"yeah I think that's fair and I think it's good that you still have that perspective, even though things are going fairly well. Because I wouldn't be concerned if you are back. To like nope we're all in just like that."
15238.0,Patient,"I don't know I don't I think I mean I would hope that I wouldn't be like that, but I feel like I will always be one foot like halfway out the door. yeah just because i'm so used to how things go. But i'll never put myself in a position where I will lose everything again."
480.0,Provider,"Exactly and that's what I was gonna say that is a very valid way to protect yourself and your needs is because he shown you that you can't be all in with him because he won't. he's not a partner, so I think the fact that you have one foot out the door is not necessarily unhealthy at this point."
15238.0,Patient,i'm not giving my all when I feel that way but.
480.0,Provider,"But you shouldn't give your all to somebody That gives you breadcrumbs. that's The difference is like he gives you. bare minimum if that in a relationship, so why would you give your all yeah."
15238.0,Patient,"Well, and I told him that even the other day I was like you know. You weren't feeling good you feel like you're going to need to go to the hospital i'm like I called in to all three of my jobs took the day off stay with you. i'm like no questions asked and i'm not trying to throw cuz he's like Oh, you always do everything in my face like i'm not trying to throw in your face i'm just trying to show you that I am always unconditionally there for you. And you can even. Give me the decent courtesy or respect to have dinner made after i've worked 13 hours like that level is not equal i'm like you sit there and tell me like oh I love you you love me twice as hard i'm like, but everything you do shows the exact opposite."
480.0,Provider,exactly like.
15238.0,Patient,Your words and your actions never match up. Never i'm like so.
480.0,Provider,words and actions not matching up is manipulation.
15238.0,Patient,"yeah. Like I think that you're using like that i'm actually like not acknowledging that now. Yes, we getting he gets really upsetting like defensive about it, but I tell them all the time i'm like you can tell me you love me 100 times a day. i'm like, but when you show me no respect and don't have any like value towards me that doesn't show love i'm like some words are meaningless at this point. Like I don't like you tell him, you can tell me, whatever you want to tell me it doesn't mean i'm going to believe you. Eric until he."
480.0,Provider,and
15238.0,Patient,"He gets mad he's like I don't know what to do show you i'm like it's little things every day like just having like color respect and common courtesy like yeah I get that you have that you stay up all night because you can't sleep, because you never had a flippin job in your life basically. But I do like I have to get up I work non stop to help support your daughter, because you do the bare minimum, for her, which is not fair. yeah i'm like but you can't even give me respect about that, like that's mine that's not the way it should be."
480.0,Provider,"Not at all. So February, you good with the same day and time for February okay."
15238.0,Patient,If something changes in my schedule i'll let you know but.
480.0,Provider,"yeah just email me like you normally do but i'll just go ahead and schedule, all of them for February and then. Just show up to whatever once you get so. This your time slot. You don't have to worry about last minute cancellations, because i'm not going to fill it with anyone else, so no worries I think last week you're like i'm running late like that's not a big deal to me. So okay cool well, I hope you have a good week. And remember, on Monday to mentioned to. know. The true positive."
15238.0,Patient,"Okay, already done right now."
480.0,Provider,Okay cool.
15238.0,Patient,"All right, thank you."
480.0,Provider,See you next week.
