15713.0,Patient,Getting over a cold.
740.0,Provider,"Oh sorry to hear that i'm sorry to hear i'm glad you don't better. yeah I mean, even if."
15713.0,Patient,"it's hard because we live on the porch. To go inside it when it's warm so it's back and forth. that's one of the reasons why I was I don't know and I didn't know if I wanted to do group, because I, but I know you brought your background so that's I do that because I embarrass so where I live, and i'm comfortable with it, but. I don't. I don't. See how I live, you know."
740.0,Provider,"Absolutely, I completely agree with it, I just keep my background so data. Because HQ. uh how's everything going, as this is the last time we spoke, I know, the last time it was pretty pretty short and sweet, but I have everything they wanted me to even fairly."
15713.0,Patient,Good the medications working so.
740.0,Provider,Okay.
15713.0,Patient,"I like it, I feel alone until is tense when I go into certain situations into stories about that."
740.0,Provider,that's really good i'm happy to hear that. i'm happy to hear that it's working for you. Oh what's been up.
15713.0,Patient,"Again, and nothing really has really changed at all i'm. Signed to my sister, but there is no better off because every time she wants to talk to me it's always she wants me to take her here take her there do this or do that, like. You can't ever just come and hang out and. You know. i'll just be a regular person is you know always want some for me, you know. Every time I asked her if you want to hang out you want to you know just. You know, watch a movie together no nothing. But she she wants to call me i'll even oh my own car that's my girlfriend's mom's car I don't have my own car So how are you expecting to go and pick you up at you know 10 o'clock at night 11 o'clock at night, like you know hey i'm not on drugs yeah I know you're on drugs. Things I gave me down because our relationship is horrible like. What kind of family are we anymore, you know."
740.0,Provider,My yeah.
15713.0,Patient,"that's that should be everybody got thanksgiving and then nobody wanted to come over not none of my brothers and my sisters knowing like. What, what are we even doing it anymore. So I took her sanity so when your mom passes i'm probably in most in nebraska because it's I can do it, I hear anymore. it's better I tell you I get treated better my family out there that are more distant from them, you know. They treat me more as a brother than anything out there yeah. No worries the reason i'm not there, right now, is because I have kristina here, you know. That her mom still alive, so I don't know it's better to move, you know."
740.0,Provider,"I think. That is definitely. The hardest thing because, especially considering what you just. What you just experienced with your mom passing things like that, like this upon for us as families to come together, you know, and the fact that you know. You can't have that because people doing my own thing that own agenda. And then, when when you have a feeling that, because. that's a no go."
15713.0,Patient,"Then, my brother told me it happens, like that bro we all grow up, we all have our own family, I like oh yeah I know that but I didn't think that we'd all just our own separate ways. I mean."
740.0,Provider,"You know, even if I mean yeah we're not going to act like it's one thing to go your to have your own life and then come together. You know i'm saying to kind of like bring everybody together we have like family outings or thanksgiving Christmas stuff like that, but the fact that now we asked them like we strangers, and we can't stand each other."
15713.0,Patient,yeah so there really as well.
740.0,Provider,"And so I know that can be pretty hard I know there's definitely hard, are you considering they're the only family, now that you have is in another state. And in the family that you do have in this state him saying basically this this immediate family, yes, I need a sibling we are really good."
15713.0,Patient,"yeah. Well, I don't want to reach out at all, but I got. People thousand miles when the brassica asked him how. how's everything you know."
740.0,Provider,yeah.
15713.0,Patient,"I went out there, probably like two three years ago, I had a really good time yeah."

740.0,Provider,mm hmm.
15713.0,Patient,"My cousin just died my cousin Diego he died from covered. So I got his name tattooed on my arm so. He treated me at the best out there who he was treating me more like a brother than anything. You always tell me to come live with them, and you know take me under his wing. It was really nice to me. yeah really devastated when he passed away he passed away in August of this year and we found out about my mom in November so that's what I wanted to get into therapy when when they both died."
740.0,Provider,hmm.
15713.0,Patient,"Two people that I was like really close to just like gone, just like that. He died he died in six days. wow yeah that he never he had diabetes too so."
740.0,Provider,How yeah.
15713.0,Patient,"It wasn't all of that means, maybe, maybe about. Four years old he's 38. hmm i'm 34."
740.0,Provider,yeah.
15713.0,Patient,"But just amazing how fast, you can go one minute here next to God."
740.0,Provider,that's why you know and that's why they have afraid to say you live every day like today.
15713.0,Patient,sure.
740.0,Provider,"Because you never know tomorrow is going to be the day. But I know you've had a lot of grief and I know that being heavy on you, which is why. I want to always make sure that i'm that i'm sensitive, I never want to push you to talk about things. Until you're ready because i'm send this to feel fresh and it's only been a few weeks, saying you. heard of your mom testing so. there's one other thing that I want to go at your pace and not mine."
15713.0,Patient,"Okay, thank you, I respect that."
740.0,Provider,"Absolutely absolutely so one of one of the goals that you said that you want to talk about wanting a treatment, those that you know you just have someone to open up to with that phone just so. What are some things that you feel comfortable disclosing or that you feel comfortable opening up about. that you would like to talk about."
15713.0,Patient,i'm not too sure I understand the question.
740.0,Provider,"So, like so you didn't you didn't give me like direct. Treatment goals you just say basically my goal is. That I came to therapy thought to have someone open up to without them, just so my question to you is open up to about what regarding what what are some ways yeah."
15713.0,Patient,"My basic goals, I want to when when I go outside to be less aggressive, I want to be able to go outside and be okay. Oh that'd be. paranoid, you know. When I like a obviously build a better relationship with my family but it takes two to tango. Right, so I want to have better communication skills, with people."
740.0,Provider,Okay. yeah they helped me out a lot. So let's let's let's go with the first one let's start with the first one so. Which one you want to do first the paranoia or aggressiveness.
15713.0,Patient,aggressiveness.
740.0,Provider,"Okay, so tell me how it started when you say aggressive aggressive half."
15713.0,Patient,"I don't like people tell me what to do. Okay that's one of the hard things like. Mainly why I don't have a job. that's one of the main reasons. You know, rather than being paranoid by going outside. and What was the question i'm so sorry."
740.0,Provider,"We cannot aggressiveness Wayne on the paranoia but let's move on aggressiveness today so we've been aggressive you don't like people telling you what to do, how did this start, what are the."
15713.0,Patient,"lessons from school cuz I used to have a psychologist when I was in school itself someone that I follow me around like throughout the day it was weird. I don't know what should follow me around but should you know talk to me talk down to me try to give me to calm down certain situations. Like I had that a ADHD who knows. That I had like the special lady like I never knew her title or what she was, but she would always follow me around, and you know if I saw again to find something she tell me to calm down. I was wearing this messy can fly and I went to school, it was on a T shirt and the principal told me take it off, I said no, I don't think it says it's like why such take it off, and then I end up swinging at him than the policeman grabbed me and he pulled me down to the ground. And I gather for assault then i'm searching my locker and i'm calling my my grandparents tell me, I was like really aggressive like no I wasn't I think that's it I said I want you to. Tell me take off my shirt for no reason. So, ever since then I had life someone follow me and school well you know I like I didn't go to the same Timothy is like a Catholic school my grandpa paid for. That, I had a sidebar on that because I needed some like II II II II classes like special education classes, so I was doing special education on my life. As souls rooms that you see in the back of high schools and stuff we're like the special people go. Now they have one of those. yeah my my pen when my penmanship was never good my math skills are never good like I tried to go to college to and I guess they don't offer those kinds of classes in college because that's how you I failed horribly. they're moving so fast just in the first day. They want. Three page essay and blah blah."
740.0,Provider,yeah.
15713.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
740.0,Provider,So.
15713.0,Patient,That that's cool did not prepare you for the world's i'll tell you.
740.0,Provider,Absolutely man. yeah I can I can agree with me with a half who don't prepare you for nothing but memory again and remember.
15713.0,Patient,"And I can't blame my grandparents because they tried they hired me a private tutor I remember. It was like 75 bucks a night every time you come over and you gotta try to teach me like Oh, they algebra one geometry like man I couldn't I couldn't understand some of that stuff. So I can't I can't knock them because they did try now the hired me different tutors in different places I just couldn't get it yeah."
740.0,Provider,"it's understandable everybody had their mom and. I think when I was in college, I like. I like to do this, one time. Because I feel I want one thing teach me how many different perspective than the other one."
15713.0,Patient,"yeah and every time I try apply for social security, these are the judges like no you don't qualify i'm like that's all my Laura said haven't given me an IQ test I bet your. melon not that smart you know."
740.0,Provider,yeah.
15713.0,Patient,"I think some smart or whatever, but i'm not that smart about that. Right, which I not and i'm not that bright side, it takes me a long time to learn stuff like especially like therapy and all this stuff it takes a long time to learn. I saw my grandma you know I just had to go to therapy when I got shot and she was like oh you don't want to go there they're going to put your trends and mads. crazy, you know, then you're already are saying get out of their own like well it's helping it says ox somebody. So now that's how I get you so, but my grandma was always against that. been going there. Ever since I spoke to and I had a therapist and all that she's like no I don't want him on a medication just talk to him. So it's hard to wear that I have family support to. My brothers don't don't think i'm you know they think oh you're fine you're just bullshitting like know if I was fine I wouldn't be living outside someone's House you know in their frickin backyard I would get a job and have my own roof over my head if I was okay."
740.0,Provider,But you know.
15713.0,Patient,"If I was okay I wouldn't be you know going to food banks when i'm hungry yeah I wouldn't be sitting there struggling. You know i'd be working or doing something, but obviously you know i'm not all there but they don't understand that, and when I try to open up to them they're like nope nope nope you weren't raised like that, well, I know I wasn't raised like that I was raised in a nice house with."
740.0,Provider,You know.
15713.0,Patient,"You never struggled for anything whenever needed for anything yeah and there were the exact opposite, you know they circled and probably all their life."
740.0,Provider,You know.
15713.0,Patient,"My phone, but I was raised with my grandma and grandpa. that's a sort of guy that's where that some of that jealousy comes from it's from how I was raised to how they were raised, you know. My brothers like we got to a fight with times, like all the golden students falling out of your mouth, I see. Anything and I don't know what do I said Fuck you. So they all treat me like that, like you know, because the way I was raised, you know versus how their race. So, then, I used to having any of that family stuff like I was. A young athlete we went to nebraska all the time seemed family over there, a tipping the Mount rushmore nascar you know I start to see hockey games baseball games had a good life they treated me really good both of them."
740.0,Provider,And the good thing about it is that you do have a good life.
15713.0,Patient,yeah.
740.0,Provider,"And sometimes if you that you can't make the seven gelatin they came from. When I am i'm your, however, they want to show it."
15713.0,Patient,"I think I still have a good life, you know. christina's mama hundred dollars for the rent. And then that's it, you know and. Obviously, by by my own food. But you know, and I came here I you know basically we do whatever I want all day you know I don't have anybody tell me what to do, or you know. Should I do this christina's mom just lets us all basically chill here we don't you know. She pays everything she pays the water, the gas, so the mortgage you know everything you know. So yeah I almost feel like there's so jealous to me until this day like because they both have to work like I don't know so my fault, you know. You got dealt those cards and I adopt these cars, you know. Like Oh, it must be nice to sit there and play video games all day you know my but they don't understand the stuff I go through the. The paranoia of nine one to go outside sometimes you know, or you know me being shot and then you know stuff yeah i'm gonna tell you my own sister said that she wanted me dead, like her texting me like oh you weren't supposed to live, you were supposed to die. Like what the heck you set that up did you want me to die, and then. years before that, when I was living with my brother and imani he ended up shot I shot a gun on me, because I was on unemployment. When I was working for less I told you don't have to leave the room, but you have to leave the room, so I can write it out, so you can say in the living room. And I have to run out the room, so it can make the rent know he ends up on a shotgun on me I didn't know what was going on my girlfriend got paranoid at the time that I was with her. She ends up blocking us in the room, called the Swat team, so the whole House surrounded helicopters flying over he ends up going to juvie for like three or four years, and so you know the old that to my over my head, to this day. But you're the one pointing the gun at me. was shot. And then just. Just just last year, my other brother like oh yeah I bought all these guns, so I can kill you like make me feel like you, you all want me dead. Man all three of you want me dead, for no reason I can't say my other sister because I really don't talk to her at all that's I got this time, you know my head, I put most hated. Because my own family, wants to be dead like they all want me dead. us probably makes the old crazy to. me dead."
740.0,Provider,"No one of the things I will say, though, this is because, because the fact. That their relationship is not good, and the relationship that I have is not healthy and there's something that you're actually trying to gain is mental health. It may be better to. not communicate with them right now. Because it doesn't seem like it's conducive to your mental health."
15713.0,Patient,"A message with my mental health really bad does that say yeah I saw I tried to talk to him, and then I pulled back real fast. It does, though. i'll agree with you right there 100% that does. Your own. Your own family and it's also wants you dead."
740.0,Provider,"right then let's hurry and then one of the things I will say is that you know you can love them, but they don't mean you got a full with them."
15713.0,Patient,yeah.
740.0,Provider,"And that's just for your own sanity because that's a lot, the first day the first day you. Excuse me experience on the ocean medic. In dealing shot, and of course yeah you get paranoid. And things like that it's very it's a very traumatic situation, and for them to. save those evil. me i'm saying again to you are they they're the that is. A fuel to the fire. You know the of what i'm already going through so it's kind of like being insensitive so what i'm going through and saying our you said no you're not doing anything but then, at the same time you have done the same, the same day that my mentor was impaired by going through such. Such a tragedy. yeah i'm saying we're being shy I could manage it and i'm so grateful that you survived because I couldn't imagine neither what I wish that on anybody. And so. I think, maybe the best thing to do. is to leave them alone."
15713.0,Patient,"yeah. Quick rundown of my life is everything was fine I had a great childhood I struggled a lot in school, you know. i'll probably start there how everything started I started when I was probably about 15 so certainly a lot in school lifestyle a lot that's very hard, the more the school hired not even my grandparents are the psychiatrists for me. After I graduated high school I made some big mistakes I end up. tapping into my ground with bank account, and I drained all her money out. that's all I got kicked out of there as soon as I hit, excuse me, so they kicked out of my grandma's house that's when everything started to go bad you know. I was introduced to drugs a lot, you know my mom was you know, a prostitute so that that. scene, all that other stuff flowing from a straight Christian home where we go to church every single Sunday rain or shine to see in the dark side of the world, I was you know my mom saying jugs my mom's prostituting you know. Just is it a lot to me yeah. yeah then from the time I moved out, you know I had this girl that I was with yeah that messed everything up because. there's some were people out there and I never knew that growing up in a Christian home this girl was into witchcraft i've never seen anybody into witchcraft. Like she had like dolls and stuff like that, like it was just weird you know. yeah you never think that people are like that, and then she's like. No, I don't need me just tell me when we got together she's like I don't need anything anybody gives me a lie, so, because you never know what they put in it, so what the heck it says so, you only at the at the potluck anything like nope oh wow."
740.0,Provider,everybody's paying note about different things I guess.
15713.0,Patient,"yeah then she had like this weird thing like she would like. Her boss's name, she would write it on a piece of like a. Paper like almost like the bag paper. She wrote it in pencil. And then she'd read it 12 times and she put it under foot and she believed in their mind that would give her the power to overthrow him. Like should step on it whenever he come around. Like it was so weird like shit like that, like oh like what the heck. But you would never notice just from looking at the person, you would notice like. When you actually live with them what's what's going on. Things like that, just like weird."
740.0,Provider,"It just sounds I mean. You can tell, why the jealousy is there because. Of course, with you being raised by your grandparents and then with him being raised by your your mom. Did shame, I mean just the lifestyle is completely different."
15713.0,Patient,Like a bad night situation.
740.0,Provider,"Man, let me say something, and I mean it's what I do speak you gotta leave some people alone even even when they your family, because you got to go or dopey you're already going through a lot, I know that you're trying to get out of so."
15713.0,Patient,"All that was before everything happened like a pilot in 2012 Min now may of 2010 I am working on i'll still working with less I am getting an apartment because I can make the drive out there, like. me and the boss orbitz would date and we ended on bad terms you know she wanted to break up I wasn't having it. And I couldn't keep seeing her every day, so it was really messing with me so i've told corporate they put me in a Sam teacher and they put her in anaheim that drive from San Diego to our money is no joke that thing was far take like an hour just to get there and back. So anyways I got an appointment and then from there, they my brother had a meeting this girl so then. I had a meeting her cousin cousin like damn grandkids doctors, we don't have enough money to pay for the rent I didn't know my mom didn't pay for the rent we're living in the room, so and i'm starting living with her. Eventually, we got our own place and then my brother, in that, and then they come and move in with us then that's that's the before I even got shot my brother we're not moving out he didn't want to go to school, he was already like 1516 didn't want to go to school at all. My mom's welfare ends up getting cut off because of him not going to school I didn't know they cut off your welfare for not going to school. But they cut his off or hers off, I should say. That you don't have to leave, but you have to live, you know, have to move out of the room say around the room, so we can make enough money to buy now he wasn't having any point the shotgun at me that's an hour they ship when really down. The only choosing here with me now something that case the cases, you have my sister lives in there her boyfriend you're living in there, your girlfriend my mom and her boyfriend none of you can call it 500 bucks. wow you're in a room together so man. Then, my mom has the gall to call my grandma and tell him tell her excuse me that i'm in my own room with my girlfriend and we're fucking all day."
740.0,Provider,one.
15713.0,Patient,"Oh that's what he's talking about. Yes, I don't know she thought calling my grandmother would do but. She thought you know. So that it made the situation worse."
740.0,Provider,So when have an answer to that and.
15713.0,Patient,"And living on my own for a while. i'm. I made a lot of mistakes and same with the girls still. I started smoking smoking dope a lot and I made some really bad mistakes. My unemployment cuts off the year after. We got kicked out of there so having a lot, a lot of riffraff over we I kicked out there by the city for gain activity. I don't know that the city can kick you out of your own apartment which I still paid rent but the landlord give me the rent backs and so now, the city once you out, so I was like okay so and moving to a different place. By unemployment runs out. Somehow we and her came up with this idea that she was a prostitute and i'll be in the other room with a gun, so we end up going to motel six off the 10 freeway renting a double room. So that one that has above. The door to go to both sides. So I end up staying in that room with a nine millimeter she ends up doing her thing in the other room So things are going good we're making money like ridiculous amount of money. gram by even buying a car like and within two weeks, when I buy a new car. Somehow. She got so lost I said, well, we have enough money for rent let's before done splott now just want to keep going so on if you're doing such as like. You know, keep putting up the ads cuz cuz she was like an escort, but it was on a website so people will just under she wouldn't have to go outside she was just saying that room all day. So she ends up getting rid of foundation going away with the client ends up leaving me there in the room for one night I was like her, she had I went over there she's gone the room was mtl at what the Fuck so. Obviously that didn't end well my and going back to our apartment. Her mom's there, I guess, your mom moved in there, so i'm just getting my little bit of stuff and I head out there, I am living with. Her mom's orphans brothers, you know how I got into that situation that didn't last very long I lasted there, maybe like a week or two, and I see they told me to kick rocks. And to find this other place I lived there for about a month or so. They end up throwing me out and we got into an altercation my sister ends up hitting me up a week before I kicked out though. She has a talking to me. I don't know what got into her, she bought me like this old. Honda car like. I even asked her if she just shut up with a study. To the keys is the title, as what the heck so she ends up giving me a car, I call her and tell them getting kicked out so she's like Okay, just like come with me we go to a zoo now and now we're just bouncing around motel motel. shanna Robin her dad for like 15,000 cash. Those Mexicans that then believe of banks put all the money in a safe and has been under his bed. let's see and then taking the heck. Of a lot for safe, with all the cash in there. Somebody in a dancing motel for a while her boyfriend ends up talking to his cousin here in pomona and we end up I said I ended up here so to end up in a trailer park for a little while. I was giving her money to pay for the rent she wasn't paying for it, she was buying drugs I find out, we got kicked out of there then. Now i'm here."
740.0,Provider,With the with the same girl.
15713.0,Patient,"Know different. Different yeah that girl she left with the client and never came back. But the. Two small world because my brother that's his baby mama he has four kids with her with her cousin so I still know what's going on in her life with I want to know what's going on, because she lives out there in victorville to with them, but she lives, like a couple houses down. So he's doing better now so i'm i'm glad cuz I was. I had a lot of guilt for that, so I was going to therapy for that back in the day. So my therapist said you can't make someone control their actions they do what they want absolutely. I was going through that a lot soon just had like Gil and it right into her telling her i'm sorry for everything and then. yeah I felt really. really bad, but I was in my right my my. My my. Right mindset there we go. and, obviously, neither was she so. But I understand my peace and all that so she she was. Okay, with it, except that. We haven't talked at all my brother told me, she has two kids now with a boyfriend so that's good. I just got her name covered I had it right here for a long time, probably slightly cover maybe last year. playing a lady I had some kind of hope that we get back together but. never happen."
740.0,Provider,"Yes, a good thing."
15713.0,Patient,"I really wanted to, though."
740.0,Provider,yeah i'm sure now mean I went through a lot together.
15713.0,Patient,Every other six years. yeah that was Christina like. Nine years that have been with Christina.
740.0,Provider,How did you end up meeting her.
15713.0,Patient,"I was there don't connect at the time I was saying he either coming to me that's how I started talking. and and stopping that because the girl, I was with the. She she was on getting the dope and I was on selling it. She. ended up meeting somebody else then she had me jumped right there. In front of the motel. Like six or seven guys started me up. that's what I want to be with her anymore, and she lost it so we're here saying that you know, all I think he touched one of my kids get him on like what the Fuck are we talking about so they all started jumping me stuff shadow me. make me have a bad name. And my name but. man. That was most abusive girl ever been with my life, am I stuck there as long as I did I can't tell you. me because I don't live my sisters anymore, we had a motel room we had it for a long time. But man every time I was like man i'm out of here she was sorry hit me with kinds of course trying to find me like you're not going anywhere, you know Fuck you get over here like right now it's take that shit and I never knew why I stood still with her. That was probably the most visible I should ever been in you and things like because i'm 66 i'm a big guy I could I could have taken her. She has like a buck 25 but I never had her anything and she was always hit me and stuff. Tell me not to leave to stay there. Then relish like Oh, I made your fair to come back home now. call me Daddy, and all this shit. I love it for two years, I didn't read. It maybe I thought I deserved it I don't know. Because in prison, now, though. Ever for a child neglect I guess she had a kid and she dropped the newborn and I guess he's mentally to say. predation yeah they put her in sugar in chino.
