105.0,Provider,mirabelle. hi.
17168.0,Patient,I was taking a minute they like they said I didn't have an appointment today.
105.0,Provider,yeah well.
17168.0,Patient,And I texted me.
105.0,Provider,"So one thing I can add for you or encourage you to do if that happens again or anything where there's a disconnect between what the virtual clinic is saying and what you believe is true. You can message me and just say they don't seem to have an appointment for me that's all you need to say. And then I can real quick I happen to look, because you you weren't here, I was a couple minutes late myself, so I looked and I, they were asking if you have an appointment. I said yes, they said we'll get a hold of use those a little a little lag but you always can just say hey there seems to be a disconnected they don't seem to have an appointment for me, but. You can do that. Okay okay all right so i'm going to just take a minute, while i'm setting up a note for us. i'd like you to. select how you felt what you thought about after our last meeting and just spend some time in your mind around that. Getting your body. President get the video, so I can see more of you, because i'd like to be able to see at least sort of from waist up charger tissue water, this would be the time to get. 30 more seconds. what's on my mind."
17168.0,Patient,"um I thought from the last session, it was really cool how you're explaining the Vegas nerve. Okay um or even how we have like different parts of ourselves that aren't necessarily like who we are, like internal managers and whatnot I thought that was pretty interesting, I have never been told that by therapist before, so I was like she knows what she's talking about um."
105.0,Provider,"Okay, good."
17168.0,Patient,"yeah that was very new to me so it's almost like yeah it's like part of me but it's like sometimes I have to like take a step back. You know. yeah that's a great. it's not you. yeah so i'd be interested in obviously like learning more about that i'm still weird or just kind of I guess i'm nervous about like the self talk, you know. Oh yeah I know you said you'd guide it, but I just feel kind of funny about it."
105.0,Provider,"And that's right on time. The feeling, not only do might you feel funny or silly you might just laugh and just go This is ridiculous, I feel ridiculous. yeah that's okay. Everybody does yeah they giggle or they. it's all right. yeah i'm not worried, I welcome it, I have a sense of humor and I realized how goofy it can seem. And i'm not i'm not concerned. you'll you'll know through experiential learning. Actually kind of how serious it is. OK, but always with me it's just this nice flow serious and playful whatever's needed at the time okay. yeah um and the other thing I heard was you had a curiosity about the Vegas nerve and I think what I do is do a lot of education about it, but I didn't teach you how to do it. yeah I didn't do it."
17168.0,Patient,yeah sometimes it can take the whole session to learn.
105.0,Provider,"Well, what do you want to do you want to. I don't have to because I did all the blah blah blah. I did all the science, I did it with you last time. it's up to you, we can dive right in, and you can get to know some of your Parts one two."
17168.0,Patient,Yes.
105.0,Provider,"Okay okay so maybe next time and we'll we'll explore having this practice of the belly breathing i'll can go over that. The reason I like people to have it as soon as possible, if they ever have moments of dysregulation. And if they they tend to do things like if they cut their own skin or they start doing some self destructive behavior it's nice to have this this one thing in their tool belt like. I do not have to completely fall apart, I can take care of myself in this moment I can do something, and they can do this practice so. that's why I like to help people have that right away. But let's see what kind of put a pin in that we can construct back to. Okay, all right let's do this so. One of the things that. I had pointed out, and I don't know how it lingered with you, was the voice."
17168.0,Patient,yeah.
105.0,Provider,And it's interesting because it moves so when you first got here was there and then you caught it maybe unconsciously and. you're on it out. So you started with and it went.
17168.0,Patient,So.
105.0,Provider,"Well, but still, you know here are this almost perfect stranger is you know saying these things to you what was that, like how did you leave the session last time without being highlighted."
17168.0,Patient,"um well obviously like already notes, like a part of me, you know I do use that voice. It doesn't make me feel any different like i'm you know, maybe like a little bit more aware that I use it, or like i'm way more aware like what i'm using it for now, because I didn't know what I was using for or how it served me um but yeah I mean."
105.0,Provider,"So you weren't offended. I don't have my other note right in front of me, whatever you and I had started it's somewhere over there it's not right here. So let's go to that acknowledgement that you have of what it does for you."
17168.0,Patient,um.
105.0,Provider,"Well, wait wait wait. Now you're in analytical mode and. Okay, so this is a little bit more guidance than probably what you're used to. yeah so let's ask whoever was about to do all that summarizing for me about all that interpretation let's ask that part to go hang out, and you know watch the Sally jessy Raphael or donahue. Show or something Rhea self help book or psychology today or some thing."
17168.0,Patient,yeah.
105.0,Provider,"The one that's analytical. The one that. sort of. The therapist right. So just begin to care less about the the face that you're seeing on the screen with me and turning more to a curiosity of your own inner landscape. The parts that might have messages for you today might have some sort of communication and we're starting today with just this idea of. This voice. And the analyst asking Alice to step back if it's okay if it takes more work than that and just finding way to get permission from it say hey would it be okay, if you know, one of your and I just. spent some time healing and inside to understand different parts. Without all of the pre analyzed summaries."
17168.0,Patient,Looking.
105.0,Provider,That easy for you to blend from that part.
17168.0,Patient,i'm trying to.
105.0,Provider,All know pretty quickly if you did but. One way to do it is to close your eyes minor closed. me see i'm not staring at you. And picture what your inner therapist looks like.
17168.0,Patient,I feel like it just it's me they're just different parts of me.
105.0,Provider,Just describe what you see in your mind's eye it's. What teachers.
17168.0,Patient,"Have glasses on. We, like the same. um professional clothing like business casual. I don't know well versed like they speak well they present themselves Hello."
105.0,Provider,"Professional. So look at that part. And now pay attention to your own body as its arms are crossed, and just notice how you feel around is it a her what's the front end will use for."
17168.0,Patient,"Their employees, yes, she her, she."
105.0,Provider,So just notice how you feel emotionally and physically around.
17168.0,Patient,"kind of shy. shy. kind of silly. Like i'm vulnerable, but I don't I don't want to open up."
105.0,Provider,yeah.
17168.0,Patient,yeah.
105.0,Provider,"Okay, so so staying there also pay attention to your face as it smiles. yeah so I i'm going to invite you to shift it to first person, and this is where the silly we might need to discharge with some laughing at first that's right on time. But it'll be something like. I feel silly talking to you, it shy. yeah and see what happens with even a part of that just talk directly to her to the therapist."
17168.0,Patient,Okay okay. i'm talking to her like directly right.
105.0,Provider,You are.
17168.0,Patient,um yeah I feel I feel very silly. almost ridiculous talking to you her talking to her.
105.0,Provider,Help talking to you.
17168.0,Patient,talking to you yeah.
105.0,Provider,"In or do you see her there. yeah okay so slow down or beat really slow down. Okay, take a breath. And look at her reaction okay. and say it again, a little slower tempo."
17168.0,Patient,Soon silly talking to you. kind of ridiculous. And I feel I feel very shy right now I feel very nervous.
105.0,Provider,And look at the reaction that you get back and. first thing that you see and notice is what.
17168.0,Patient,A smile. She says okay. Like everything's okay.
105.0,Provider,everything's okay. let's see. What do you respond when you hear everything's okay and smiles.
17168.0,Patient,What do I respond with.
105.0,Provider,"What do you experience so i'm going to say what do you experience, and that includes thoughts physical and emotional reaction so i'm going to say experience, because it encapsulates a lot. Okay yeah."
17168.0,Patient,Like validation reassurance. um.
105.0,Provider,"So share it with her you just told me we're going to do, one more time go to her and sort of say something like I feel kind of validated by you."
17168.0,Patient,"I feel validated by you, I feel reassured by you. Thank you."
105.0,Provider,What do you notice in the response from that part.
17168.0,Patient,you're welcome smile here welcome.
105.0,Provider,"Can you ask that part and be very careful don't take your eyes your inner imagery off of the therapist. Because you're going to hear a question that you're going to ask that you may not be accepting this can you ask that part hey, what do you think of the little girl voice."
17168.0,Patient,"What do you, what do you think of the little girl voice. I tell you my response."
105.0,Provider,Well it's it's. You absolutely do absolutely as soon as you can before other parts start popping up it'll happen awfully fast.
17168.0,Patient,"yeah unless she said, I think she's great she's a part of you. she's meant to be there."
105.0,Provider,Can you ask the therapist. What she does for the system.
17168.0,Patient,What do you do for the system. She helps she listens she. i'm. blanking out.
105.0,Provider,"Okay, so just notice how you experience with the blanking out okay got it we got a little bit of information. be present with that and then taking a look, if you haven't already to this little girl voice this helpful part. That listens. and see if you can also see that as a separate part of you. Just kind of bring me into the imagery you get it only helps just so that I can support."
17168.0,Patient,My books.
105.0,Provider,"yeah sometimes it happens. Just sort of support dual awareness, if you can describe it it'll take a second with your cat there but come on back. And just picture the little girl voice again. yeah and tell me the imagery you get so that I can write it down and help keep you in that duality."
17168.0,Patient,"um the imagery i'm getting for the little girl voice is me, but my younger self so like my child so. it's anywhere from like five to eight. Little kid. Long hair. sneakers jeans T shirt. yeah."
105.0,Provider,"Do you remember from maybe the last time we did this, and I could be mistaken, but was there a sense of this coming about at age five. There was some essence of. Like."
17168.0,Patient,don't.
105.0,Provider,ask too much of me there was something you had said.
17168.0,Patient,"about the voice. yeah um I said, well, I said it, I use it it like go easy on me."
105.0,Provider,So it's sort of tagline it's hashtag is go easy on me.
17168.0,Patient,I hate him.
105.0,Provider,"So, looking at that little girl part. As a protector, not the one. Not the wounded part but just the one that serves you one that says to the world. Go easy on me."
17168.0,Patient,My protected.
105.0,Provider,it's actually it's actually another the little girl voices. So protective part yeah. And it says go easy.

17168.0,Patient,Okay.
105.0,Provider,So for you. Just spend a second and just share some gratitude with that part that one came on showed up to take care of you very early on.
17168.0,Patient,With a little girl with my little self.
105.0,Provider,"Specifically, as a protector, though. Really isn't a role of taking care of you managing making sure that nothing bad happens. In your own language, just watch it closely. and share your gratitude toward it first person, if you can."
17168.0,Patient,"Thank you for helping me. get through hard times, or even when i'm uncomfortable or nervous, to say how I feel you help me. You help me feel more comfortable more ease."
105.0,Provider,And how long does it see us.
17168.0,Patient,"Now, like my age now again."
105.0,Provider,"Okay, sees you as an adult. Can you ask it, what is it concerned will happen. If it didn't work as hard."
17168.0,Patient,"What, what do you. say to him what, what do you think."
105.0,Provider,yeah what are you concerned will happen.
17168.0,Patient,Okay.
105.0,Provider,You don't do your job so much.
17168.0,Patient,"Okay. What are you concerned will happen. If if you do your job or, if you do it too often."
105.0,Provider,If you do your job less.
17168.0,Patient,Do you have the less.
105.0,Provider,might need to say it again you've got to watch that imagery wonderfully and wait for the response and then tell me what is.
17168.0,Patient,"She saying, she doesn't she doesn't think she'll be heard or seen. Like no one's gonna listen."
105.0,Provider,i'd like you to respond to that part. out loud.
17168.0,Patient,Just silly.
105.0,Provider,"Okay. It might have something like it might be like this. So you're afraid, no, no, listen to me."
17168.0,Patient,yeah.
105.0,Provider,"If you back off. you're worried, no one will listen to me. yeah okay so find your own language, not this therapist."
17168.0,Patient,Okay. So you're afraid no one's gonna listen to me or help me.
105.0,Provider,So feel how much is that feel how much of that is true for you feel into it is this part correct and it's assessment of what will happen.
17168.0,Patient,i'm blanking out.
105.0,Provider,"Okay, so notice your own face."
17168.0,Patient,notice yeah yeah.
105.0,Provider,"Present with just just feeling the cheeks mouth. be feeling the posture the head down. yeah being aware of it. Something that has to be changed, but just gently tuning into it being there. Right now notice how you feel towards the little girl voice."
17168.0,Patient,Like I feel about her. she's chillin.
105.0,Provider,she's challenge. How do you kill around her.

105.0,Provider,Okay okay.
17168.0,Patient,"Like i'm like I feel like i'm the one, taking care of her."
105.0,Provider,I got it right. What does she need you to protect her from.
17168.0,Patient,"The world everything my parents, especially."
105.0,Provider,"i'm suspecting this is more about. A wounded parts so for a moment, continue to because probably what got triggered was a wounded heart. Okay, that got blended it's all right that that's. Really normal really, really normal. Because the go easy on me as deeply rooted in little girl yeah what's the emotion that little girl had from those parents."
17168.0,Patient,They anger lots of anger. Little.

To ask this angry little girl this history H5. huh to not be full energy just not overwhelm you today, we can listen to her message you can hold space for her you and I were both do that, but can she not overwhelm us today because all of your protective parts will show up and it'll just we won't be able to. really feel compassion and empathy for her."

105.0,Provider,chill out. And we can be with her.
17168.0,Patient,"So I say that, though, like in first person."

Hold space for her. So just look at her crying and not wanting to look at you. What emotions come up in you, as you are with her going through that."
17168.0,Patient,It makes me sad. Like I feel for her.

17168.0,Patient,"So i'm sitting down with her. And i'm trying to get close but not like aggressively. And you know show her that i'm i'm safe. So i'm not hurting her, I want to help her. and i'm like opening my arms i'm just like waiting for her to respond. because she still closed off."
105.0,Provider,"You know what the delay is in her being in your arms, do you know what what's in between you and her."
17168.0,Patient,I think she just upset. She does I don't think she wants to be touched.

17168.0,Patient,Her.
105.0,Provider,Look at her was there anyone she could trust to trust touch trust. Then you gotta let her know that you get it and it's not enough to just say I understand.
17168.0,Patient,it's hard explaining it to a kid.
105.0,Provider,"I know we're doing it together, though, so just stay with it something like all baby girl goodness, you know what you see is all this scary stuff going on with mom and dad and. You don't want to bug anybody or whatever, the truth is not one of errors made up story. You were there. yeah that's how we talked a little ones. With us prosody we raise our voice just a little bit. His words that a child can understand."
17168.0,Patient,"Really to. see that kind of silly I know how to talk to kids though it's just like talking to myself, I think, is like you know."
105.0,Provider,What part knows how to talk to her.

105.0,Provider,That what she needs she's. Trying to trust you.
17168.0,Patient,"i'd say no, she doesn't need that. I feel like she just need someone. Just like arms out just just putting themselves out there, like no no bs. hahaha you know."
105.0,Provider,Why don't you ask her what game YouTube could play. So that she could get a little closer to so she could trust you that you're safe.
17168.0,Patient,"I asked her. What game, do you want to play so. You can."
105.0,Provider,I can earn your trust.
17168.0,Patient,So I can earn your trust.
105.0,Provider,Watch her closely.
17168.0,Patient,Coming up is like cat's cradle.
105.0,Provider,"Okay, can you guys do that together. yeah sort of do that and then she's a little closer."
17168.0,Patient,Okay.
105.0,Provider,what's your face look like.
17168.0,Patient,more focused. Less less crying. So she looks like she's upset but she's not actively.
105.0,Provider,You let her know that you want to earn her trust.
17168.0,Patient,"just say no, I want to earn your trust, I want you to be able to trust me."
105.0,Provider,She do.
17168.0,Patient,She said okay. She went like this and said okay.
105.0,Provider,"All right, okay. Do you want to be trustworthy."
17168.0,Patient,me. yep yeah yes. Okay.
105.0,Provider,"Looking at her what is it that you think. That will bring for her if you are someone who's there for her in a consistent reliable way. Oh, that helper."
17168.0,Patient,"that's like her lifeline in a way. she's not alone. She has someone who's real, genuine."
105.0,Provider,"She has a message to you, maybe she shows up in some way through anger or hurt. He thinks she's trying to tell you."
17168.0,Patient,i'm not entirely sure.
105.0,Provider,"yeah that's a big one, I I probably went too fast. What we'll end with this idea, keep looking at her. See if you're willing. To more often. check in with her and see what she wants and how you can help and how you can be there, so she's not alone."
17168.0,Patient,Go talk to her.
105.0,Provider,yeah sure.
17168.0,Patient,it's a fantastic kid like what in what ways can I be there for you i'm feeling right.
105.0,Provider,"Now, yes it's okay it's okay. Well you'll get an answer by the response. I think it might be a bit demanding. Because she's probably already doing so much work and be good for us to to just do what we know she needs. But she was listening just now, what happened when you said, is it appropriate, you checked it out first you won't really careful, you can get checked it out to see what's developmentally appropriate. yeah. What was she doing when you did that."
17168.0,Patient,"I think just just chillin not doing anything. Maybe maybe kind of listening, but. Nothing no response."
105.0,Provider,So why don't you do it in a little whisper voice.
17168.0,Patient,On whisper to her to.
105.0,Provider,tell her something like. Can I ask you what you want.
17168.0,Patient,"Is it Okay, if I asked you what you want."
105.0,Provider,What is her face do and her body.
17168.0,Patient,She she goes.
105.0,Provider,"yeah Okay, so we got bit of an answer, how do you interpret that sideways."
17168.0,Patient,Maybe she doesn't know.
105.0,Provider,"Which yeah that's right, so we don't want to add more pressure you got an answer. yeah it'd be good for us as adults. right to do some work. In not put more pressure. huh right Okay, but there might be other times that she does know what her messages to you. She might be crying she might be angry. and your willingness to at least listen and be there, say, what is it that you need and want. In a sense, by just showing up. And being present for that. How can you show up and be there for her in ways that the therapist cannot."
17168.0,Patient,um. i'd say more like a friend.
105.0,Provider,Okay.
17168.0,Patient,right then like or like protector then like. doctor or like like a stranger you know.
105.0,Provider,you're more familiar.
17168.0,Patient,More or.
105.0,Provider,Less professional.

105.0,Provider,Okay.
17168.0,Patient,we're not there. Yet i'm not there to like pick her up hurt you know.
105.0,Provider,"Oh yeah not deconstructing figure apart. yeah yeah you're there, though that's."
17168.0,Patient,weird yeah.
105.0,Provider,Your screens frozen.
17168.0,Patient,"That sucks. Okay i'm going to. hi hi so yeah i'm watching my my screen spin around it might actually be me it doesn't often happen that it's my end but maybe the middle of the day, everybody's online at all yeah you know so. If you can, if it's not too uncomfortable shoes, you can just share a little bit about what you noticed about today. um well kind of almost like what I said before, like I didn't really know there were like other parts of myself. and actually let go through this exercise with you, and like do it myself. I feel like it's obviously more what intro it's more I come, like diving into like the parts of myself. And it was interesting because it's like I just like I said I just didn't know they were there, and so it's like now i'm like more aware of their their you know, maybe it would do some good to acknowledge those parts and like talk to them. You know. and I noticed, and I could be incorrect, there was no what I call aspect um. There was an absence of crying there was seat you saw her crying yeah but at any point. Did you DG who feel her sadness oh yeah I I feel like I was holding it back for sure. Ah, OK, I got it got it. I just didn't like I was so focused on like talking and like doing like the you know exercise that I was like I just yeah I could I could definitely cry right now but I don't want to get distracted with that i'd rather stay in it. Yet. OK. So those um so right if we were. You know. And we're doing it now i'm talking about it now. Because this is so new mm hmm. The parts that have been cut off. won't know that you really get it. If you don't have an empathic resonance with it and i'm glad you have compassion that's wonderful and you did have a sense of feeling could have potentially felt with her. But it is. Something very special and unique to have her witness you really natural experience was like okay. it's a whole lot better than you know how we might placate kids and say oh they're there it's not that fast will be okay yeah it's very different than. them seeing. You hurting with them yeah. And so, if those thoughts ever come into your head like i'm holding back it's like I could cry with her like something like that yeah free to narrate those to me, and then I can be guide more I can ask different questions. But this is it you know, this is a process. And so i'm just saying anything that comes up oh I just noticed, I was grinding my teeth or my stomach just turned right, I want to pull up or you know I feel like crying you know, whatever it is, and that's why that work, you know what are you experiencing. it's more than just what the therapist would say Oh, this was really interesting parts, this is introspective very cool. it's narrating to me as much as you can. so that I can get in there and kind of get dialogues going that may not occur to you mm hmm yeah yeah I mean that's just how I can be useful as as the clinician yeah. Certainly, could do this stuff on your own you don't necessarily need me but oftentimes it gets a little confusing yeah women mucking around in there. and For an extra. Very at home. I don't remember, I remember that I couldn't see you again this week um and he said that's fine i'm right and then we'll just come around to the idea of US seeing each other twice a week next next week, but I don't remember setting a date. i'm looking right now. Well let's figure it out, because i'm sitting here with these days they'll disappear um so right now i'll tell you what I have, I have 11 o'clock on a Monday 11am on a Monday. could be followed up by 12 o'clock on a Wednesday, and it could be one o'clock on that Friday it spread out those days. You could have Monday Friday that's a cut some time in between yeah so you could have 11 or 12 on Monday, which sounded better having real close times like Wednesday Wednesday or Monday Friday I can't remember. If you have certain days are easier than others. um it's not a big deal to me like Monday Friday is fine i'm to write this down, it would break December 13 at 11am OK. and December 17 at probably i'll say one o'clock but if i'm running late. Because i'm running I have an 11 and 12 o'clock group. But just message me and say hey i'm here, you know i've already check in or something like that I should only be if I am later when only be like two or three minutes Okay, and the 13th was at 11am and 12 yeah 11am OK. And then December 17 at 1pm okay. And then they the clinic told me to check in with them when I get done with my appointments. When you get done yeah they're like when you get done, could you come back and I was like sure, but I didn't do that last time because last time they're like oh let's get you your appointment and I was like. cool, but then we already scheduled it, so I was like I need to do it, you won't be going back to schedule anything I don't know what else they're doing. that's up to you, but I will say if you've already checked in which I think you have, I think I got a message there's she said Angelina said i'll send her now you know. that's up to you, like you, could I you scheduling your appointments with the all my clients do it's kind of rare I think most people go through very hard. But i've scheduled them directly okay yeah that's what I figured. All right, well cool and then I will see you on Monday Okay, thank you i'll see you there Okay, thank you bye."
