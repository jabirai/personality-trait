706.0,Provider,"Alright sorry about this crazy, and so my group ran over which wasn't a bad thing, but then I was trying to get into my personal room and it kept kicking me out and then, when I finally got in I couldn't I didn't have any sound, so I had to fix some stuff so I apologize."
3290.0,Patient,you're all good.
706.0,Provider,How are you feeling.
3290.0,Patient,"um I just had my last surgery, the other day."
706.0,Provider,Okay.
3290.0,Patient,Though i'm still nauseous.
706.0,Provider,"yeah I bet I bet it. So I haven't seen you in a few weeks, how how how things man."
3290.0,Patient,"it's been going okay i'm still bed bound right now but. Okay, and just nauseous since I said, they said, give me about two weeks I should be okay okay."
706.0,Provider,how's your pain.
3290.0,Patient,"i'm about an eight. Okay, give or take some days okay."
706.0,Provider,Have you did you get anything for pain or dad okay.
3290.0,Patient,But I take my soapbox and so. it's either take the suboxone or take them both and puke and. uh huh it's too much.
706.0,Provider,So another action and you would have to speak with your your medical provider that provides the suboxone who's your doctor.
3290.0,Patient,says me. zach. yeah Isaiah.
706.0,Provider,And Isaiah is out.
3290.0,Patient,"Okay, I hear you. Okay. Now I can hear you."
706.0,Provider,"Like there's some like weird zoom fog or something it's been really bad today i'm. Sometimes, what they do for people that aren't on suboxone I know it has talked about it in the past and with other patients that I have with him. is sometimes temporarily they'll increase the suboxone dose because suboxone going to work better on your pain than any other artificial opioid because your receptors are plot, so you have to take so much of it for them to even get any kind of effect. So you know, for instance, when you're on the right dose of suboxone you plug those receptors in your. Brain so that's why, if you go in you use heroin that can do anything you know you would have to use so much and that's why people odd because they have to use so much more. than what they used to, to get any kind of an effect. So what the suboxone though that is what's plugging those receptors so they increase that a little bit a lot of times you get some pain relief from it, too, and just temporarily increase it to get you through this and then. You know, and then dropping back down to your black dose so that's something to definitely consider unfortunately Isaiah is out. I don't know what's going on but he's out for a little bit um it might be something that if you go into the vc clinic you can ask if there is a provider that's kind of covering for him that maybe you could set up an appointment with. And maybe talk with them, because I don't know how long he's going to be out, but I would hate to see you be in pain and I don't want you to take too many opioids where you puke, which is what you were doing."
3290.0,Patient,When you took the good at. Once. And I did it again oh wait no.
706.0,Provider,"yeah exactly so and you don't want and you don't want to do that so it's kind of like that one or one or the other kind of thing, and you know, because otherwise you'd like you said you got sick and so. I definitely my after we're done here just pop back into the BC and kind of explain the situation and see if there's another doctor that you might be able to speak with. Okay, so."
3290.0,Patient,"As I know I was supposed to see him like right before my surgery, and then he just get. That link they did something I got a phone call and then all of a sudden. He was like well and then all my prescription came i'm like. what's going on. yeah she."
706.0,Provider,"was out for a couple weeks. And he dredged everybody's prescriptions basically for those two weeks, then it came back and now he's gone again. So they've got some other medical doctors kind of studying and trying to help out so um yeah it's makes things a little bit more complicated definitely doable so maybe, just like I said happened to the vc when we're done and just. Initially, what they can do that to hook you up with somebody that maybe you can talk to you about what's going on. Because nobody wants you to be uncomfortable I mean that's not something we want so. So, but um now that you've had your final surgery like is this going to solve the issue, because I know you were really sick."
3290.0,Patient,i've lost what before this started I weighed 160 i'm down to 135 wow.
706.0,Provider,"I mean most women, women complain about like losing 25 pounds, but the way that you did it probably not the best. yeah. it's not that it's not the right kind of the right kind of diet. So um how you feeling mentally how's your mental health."
3290.0,Patient,"You know I don't really. With all the surgeries and everything that's going on, I just I really have not had time to think and slow down. I don't really."
706.0,Provider,"You feel like your thoughts just kind of race, all the time."
3290.0,Patient,"it's just they're always going. Okay, I don't have time to settle down mm hmm. it's just I think it's because i'm stuck in this bed."
706.0,Provider,"Well yeah you have all you have to do is think like you have so much time to just sit there, and thanks for your mind just goes and goes and goes."
3290.0,Patient,"that's, the only thing I."
706.0,Provider,mm hmm.
3290.0,Patient,And then the TV i'm watching the same thing so i'm getting bored anxious and. can't wait to get out of this bed. Nothing I haven't had any panic attacks.
706.0,Provider,positive sign um are you sleeping okay.
3290.0,Patient,yeah.
706.0,Provider,"Okay that's good that's good that's really important when you're recovering from a physical or mental health or anything sleep that sleep is so so important. You know, and just taking care of yourself physically it's going to affect your mental health, as well as your physical health, you know as well as you know, recovery as well you know, like. All of that. All those things together, and then making sure that you have a really strong support network, which I know you said that you had family that lives with you that's really supportive."
3290.0,Patient,yeah I have a lot.
706.0,Provider,"yeah so you've got that support that you need, especially during the time that you're recovering from surgery, you know."
3290.0,Patient,Just have.
706.0,Provider,is having people there that can help you because you know you're very limited to you know what you can do after surgery. So um so did they tell you that this is going to fix the problem.
3290.0,Patient,"they're hoping, but they they did find out that because of all of this, that my kidney my right kidney. is starting to shut down."
706.0,Provider,Oh no.
3290.0,Patient,"Because it's been so inflamed for so long, but they started me on some medication that. it's like I look like a pharmacy that's maybe gonna. stop it, and like. go down to size it some find its large okay too big."
706.0,Provider,"Okay, and that's The other thing too why it's really important to get a medical appointment with one of the fighters because, with all the medications that you're on. We need to know what those are to make sure that there's not going to be some like weird reaction with the suboxone or something like that so. i'm just being able to meet with them say hey, this is what i'm on i'm having a lot of pain, because I just had this done. You know, is there, something that you know you can do, because I got the medic, but when I take it, and i'm taking my suboxone It makes me, really, really L and you know there'll be able to help you figure out something, but we definitely need to know any new medications that you're taking."
3290.0,Patient,"Okay, I will do that then."
706.0,Provider,"Okay, so. I mean you seem for everything you've been through you seem to be in good spirits, I mean. I don't know I mean you've been through a lot in the last few weeks, I know, the last time I saw you, you were pretty much in tears, because your doctor, just like took off and left and you're like did you forget to do something, before you left."
3290.0,Patient,They gave me a new doctor.
706.0,Provider,I did a. yeah so did was that a positive change.
3290.0,Patient,It was because I really thought that I was going to die.
706.0,Provider,"Okay okay good so Dr was attentive and. You know, take care of what you needed good good good um you know and now you're just in recovery, you know. Just recovering from your surgery, and you just have to let that happen you just have to let your body heal as long as that takes for it to happen. You just have to let it happen take it easy take care of yourself, you know, try and stay positive like I said surround yourself with those really positive supports. And you know that's really all you can do, because your body's just going to heal on its own time, you know you can't push a fast forward button, unfortunately. Right so. So you just hang out and bad read a good book, do you like to read."
3290.0,Patient,No really I do read when I need to go to sleep i've been journaling.
706.0,Provider,"journaling is excellent to journalists excellent, especially when you have all those racing thoughts. Getting writing them on paper, sometimes get somebody or head, so you can kind of shut down a little bit um you know."
3290.0,Patient,hollering i've been coloring my daughter got me in the adult coloring book time.
706.0,Provider,"I love those I mean i've always loved to color but now they have all these little like intricate things and oh yeah I didn't keep you busy you lose yourself in the picture. And it's so satisfying because, as you go like you just create this like masterpiece of like are you know and so it's just really satisfying to watch how it progresses. So I think that's great to um you know, and I think you know anything that you can do to occupy your time. You know, to get you through this like rough spot is going to be great because you know you have idle hands a lot of time, do you think a lot and sometimes thinking a lot is not the best thing, depending on what you're thinking about so. Definitely um Have you had any urgent cravings you know triggers or anything since you've been going through all of this to us or."
3290.0,Patient,"um no but i've never use, so I wouldn't even know what that even. That contains."
706.0,Provider,I lasted about 10 seconds what was last thing that you said.
3290.0,Patient,"I said i've never used any drugs, so I wouldn't know. How that would even. I don't know my body's never done that mines all for pain."
706.0,Provider,mm hmm.
3290.0,Patient,So I wouldn't even know if my body was even telling me to use.
706.0,Provider,"Like. While you were on you, you have you were using pain, you are using medication for pain and then. To go off at you went on the suboxone so you don't have you've not had any like urges to go back to just using pain medication and kind of it. And that you understand what i'm saying you haven't had those urges to just kind of go back and be like. I just want to take the pain medication, because that just worked, you know, like I don't want to be on the suboxone anymore, or I want to quit this suboxone or you know those kinds of things."
3290.0,Patient,"No, because I use the sandbox they told me, I was using the suboxone for pain, so I don't. i've never even thought, even taking it."
706.0,Provider,"Okay Okay, so your suboxone is for is for your pain management. To kind of get you over so maybe yeah maybe it needs to increase a little bit then."
3290.0,Patient,"Typically, people."
706.0,Provider,Max on it's because they were on like pain medications or other opiates and they're coming off of them and then they go on suboxone so.
3290.0,Patient,Know mine was all for pain.
706.0,Provider,"Okay, so, then that makes more sense so yeah so I definitely think that that's something that you would want to talk to the doctors about and definitely get through it take about get their take on that and then let them know the other medications as well. But um. So, as far as pain pain affects people in so many different ways, like psychologically, physically, you know just all of these different things um if you're at an eight pretty consistently. What is that doing to your quality of life."
3290.0,Patient,"I don't know because bed some I just I just feel worthless, most of the day, but then I start coloring or my daughter comes down. or my granddaughter comes down she's she keeps me good but she's sleeping right now are she'd been here."
706.0,Provider,"For you have those those positive things to kind of keep you. guys mm hmm so and are you getting are you getting a lot of rest because typically when you're in recovery or you, you know you rest a lot."
3290.0,Patient,"Are you getting enough sleep a lot. Usually, if this light is off I fall asleep but. I turned it on her I wouldn't have made it."
706.0,Provider,um So is there anything that you want to talk about is there anything that's kind of weighing on you at all.
3290.0,Patient,"Not right now, no okay i'm actually pretty good right now i'm good."
706.0,Provider,"Well, I don't wanna I don't want to keep you too long, I think your rest is important, and so, if you feel like. You don't have anything that's really major that you have going on any. New not having any thoughts of like hurting yourself hurry."
3290.0,Patient,Other oh.
706.0,Provider,"No all of those things you feel pretty good with your mental health. Obviously the physical pain is is there and it's real and you have to deal with that, but I think you're coping with that well. We came up with a plan to speak to a medical doctor, let them know about them new medications you're on as well as. Possible pain management, a little bit maybe increasing because obviously you just had surgery. So yeah I mean if you're if you're. Good. place we don't have to have a real long session today because I think that your your recovery from your surgery is it's going to be really important and getting that rest and taking."
3290.0,Patient,care.
706.0,Provider,Of the call.
3290.0,Patient,"Okay yeah I have a little issue, I think it like a week, we can."
