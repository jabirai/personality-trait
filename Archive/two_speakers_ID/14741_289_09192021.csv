And then, after I was born and grew for another. 15 years. pie, I don't smoke anymore, but it is completely legal in California. And I have nothing bad to say about it. Nor will I ever feel any different about that. too, so you know. But and I don't you know I actually missed smoking weed in the past when i've stopped drinking.

14741.0,Patient,"i'm. Not on like a daily weekly or monthly basis, like once a year, I might. dabble and a recreational. Drug use. It is. Definitely in the consistently once a year for the last five years."
289.0,Provider,Like what you want more help in. That.
14741.0,Patient,"Sure yeah I have no really i've the whole like. Recreational drug use, once a year has been like. fleeting moment of like you know my early 20s kind of you know hanging out with some people that I used to hang out with and, like, I know that i'm just trying hard. You know, remembering. Certain times in the past, and I really have no interest in doing it anymore."
289.0,Provider,And well alcohol when was the last time you had any.
14741.0,Patient,It was the 28th of August.
289.0,Provider,"Okay, so it's been a while. wow that's the first time you."
14741.0,Patient,"The first time was stopped. Is that what he said. i'm no. i'm. Like two years for about a year before my first daughter was born in 2012 I stopped for. About a year. But since then. Since a. sounds like I don't know a year. No longer than that, I think. About 2014 I started drinking heavily again. I don't think I really quit since late 2014."
289.0,Provider,"And if you like, this time, like be different."
14741.0,Patient,yeah it's it's definitely a different.
289.0,Provider,more about that.
14741.0,Patient,"um. Well, I don't have my. circle that I grew up with you know I don't have. I don't live in the same area where I you know. Is. How much it is depressing to say that I mean it's a beautiful area it's gorgeous there's beaches is mountains just there used to be rivers. um but those drugs ramp it drags everywhere, I mean just pot, you know it's there's. People getting busted for math people were getting busted for heroin people getting busted for. what's up stuff called fentanyl. I mean, like every day, and then you know there's. Probably 1000 legal grows where they pay money to the State and then there's probably 10,000 illegal grows and like. 10s to hundreds of illegal get grounds get busted every day. And then there's just regular people that smoke and it's you know the fog that rolls in off the Pacific Ocean and come up beds. You know the the freezing cold the wet cold i'm used to the dry cold, where I live, now. it's so like you know the depression sets in from lack of vitamin D there's always fog. And then the circle that I grew up with like you know my mom's here by my brother's nearby. You know where I grew up the House I grew up in Oh, the other House I used to live in oh that's where that thing happened and that's where. You know 10 years I got jumped in front of that building oh that's that job that didn't work out that's that you know that's where one my ex girlfriends you still live, you know. I don't have that, where I live, now. Only thing I have that similar to that, where I live, now is where i'm I moved out here to or Fino. Which is outside of Fort Jones California students just keep county. The most northern county before you get to medford. Oregon and but I moved out here from Humboldt with this buddy of mine i've known for 20 years I used to grow weed for him. back. 15 years ago. and grow I moved out here with him to grow hey on his alfalfa farm and we had a falling out over unpaid wages. And i've known him for like on the air is my mom was his T ball coach growing up, you know, like known them for a long time. And he just decided not to pay me so i'm. In the process of working for him, I met my girlfriend and we have a brand new baby together and we lived on the street and still like I still have a little bit of that. You know, like to welling animosity towards like childhood memory and it's just down the street, but you know it's it's one of my stressors um but it's been a couple years since he talked to me over so. it's not like something i've. it's like only when I bring it up through I draw on it, and then I kind of just. let it go."
289.0,Provider,and When you were drinking how much did you take.
14741.0,Patient,"um. I pretty much limited myself to how much money, I was willing to spend. There wasn't ever really like. Because I don't drink and drive period, you know. Not into it, I don't want to lose my rights to drive ever That is ridiculous, you know, and you know, possibly cause self harm or harm to others or property damage, I mean that's. insane that people willingly do that on a daily, especially in this county fairs people drinking very every day, and you can see it in their swerving you can see it. In their drinking, I mean you can see him behind you driving behind so he i'm drinking something those were veins do decide to pass on you see that it's an alcoholic beverage. But so like I don't know if I had $100 in the bank and I was waiting to pay day i'd spend 70 have it on our call. um and I. I truly have, in the last few months have been going back and forth, but. You know hard i'll call i'm unbelievably hard to deal with, I mean I I think i'm funny I think i'm. exciting, you know positive, but nobody else thinks that way. So I switched to beer or malt liquor or you know what liquor is like. Like the mike's hard lemonade all cans they're like 8% and they're like 24 ounces so you know, three, four or five of those. quickly you know i'll drink to i'll pretty much chug one or shotgun one and then i'll maybe shock on another and then slowly drink two more. And by that time I do usually either. Do something foolish or you know pass out. Then i've just. it's not about that one."
289.0,Provider,"Okay. So, what are you hoping to get on a break apart, are you looking for something specific."
14741.0,Patient,I think. Mainly. Looking forward to. partnering with somebody. Be part.
289.0,Provider,"yeah we definitely that's a requirement. You have you come to weekly group meetings. and on top of that, we have you do individual one on one sessions. So that would be very helpful. Were you thinking about any medication. Or do you feel like the therapy would be the main thing."
14741.0,Patient,"So that's. interesting because I mean I don't. You know i've never been diagnosed anything, nor have I ever went out of my way to try to be diagnosed with anything um. I. I you know I think everything is a choice, regardless of addiction. You know i'm it's like i'm still choosing to use tobacco there's no. Yes, I have like a. Underlying feeling that, like once I finished smoking my hand reaches for another one without you know my subconscious is telling me that I still need to smoke, so I do it without. You know. Choosing to to per se."
289.0,Provider,"Okay, to plenty of people who continue without any medication."
14741.0,Patient,"yeah I just i've never i've never taken any. I think like back to my early. Early you know adolescent drinking beers, I would like take supplements Prozac and drink like five or something with it and it never. I don't even remember doing anything I don't know why I thought that it would. But I mean the only thing that is in a friend of mine that has been free of drugs and alcohol for like 10 years was telling me it's totally normal. But i've just been so freaking angry. About I mean just everything irritates me and like i'm a big guy I don't like being mad because when i'm I mean I would never like inflict harm on anybody because I don't believe in violence but. I mean. I just get so freaking upset about. The littlest stuff you know it's hard. Stop drinking yeah. Okay."
289.0,Provider,yeah I think your friend is probably right to and that it's hard on your whole body actually see been drinking for a while.
14741.0,Patient,And all the way.
289.0,Provider,Up to taken away all those feelings kind of start coming back and you don't have the up all those numbers down.
14741.0,Patient,A real feelings.
289.0,Provider,"yeah really yeah they're emotional but also like your body has a lot of senses to like there's a lot of fight or flight. Something or temper temper down and then so when you take those away here constantly feeling like even your body is feeling like there's something wrong so that could be normal just withdraw eccentric time to go me. So I suspect that will get better with time, as your body used to being without alcohol. yeah yeah so some interesting. it's it's really bad I can prescribe medicine, but it's totally up to you, depending on how bad, it is to just kind of help your body calm down so it's not feeling that anymore."
14741.0,Patient,What would it be.
289.0,Provider,And it could be something like. Quantity or. Does that kind of common one gather penton small.
14741.0,Patient,me and I freakin servers.
289.0,Provider,yeah just some options. To calm your system down. yeah. What I like that.
14741.0,Patient,What affects my driving.
289.0,Provider,"and occasionally a side effect can be can get drowsy so it just depends on you, if you're here. I mean worry and might choose like one or the other that's less likely to do that."
14741.0,Patient,"I honestly would. have never see this the hardest part for me is like. i've never been willing to ask for help. So, like. I mean like i've had several life altering bad experiences, the last 10 years like at least. six. Like major life disasters. And like i've never followed through with help i've just always drink, you know. So, like. Even asking for you to prescribe me something feels weird to me."
289.0,Provider,"Okay gotcha yeah and. Totally okay and i'm glad you're reaching out for help, at least, you know, open to it. What I can do is I can just prescribe one maybe something called presence and you don't have to pick it up, but it'll be there if you need it. and If. You take it as needed once or twice a day okay far withdrawal symptoms, or that feeling that you have injured or things that you just haven't felt before. Like you can't sleep that night because your body's ramped up from it. And then, when you don't need it, you don't have to take it. The big side effects, is it can lower your blood pressure, sometimes So if you feel dizzy from it, that means you need to stop it. Again, you don't need this is not a necessary medicine. yeah you don't have to pick it up."
14741.0,Patient,So hey if I have the five slightly elevated blood pressure would that be like a counterbalance.
289.0,Provider,"If I was worried about it. It might lower your blood pressure, but it's not the best blood pressure, medicine. has high blood pressure and it wouldn't be a medicine at choice."
14741.0,Patient,"Sir, no i'm just. yeah either."
289.0,Provider,yeah yeah it's not the past or do you have a primary care clinic.
14741.0,Patient,"I do have a primary care clinic but it's not where I live. And I haven't transferred it over to the county that I live yeah. Probably. i've been really. It took me three years to get a primary doctor I used to live. And then I moved to the cause like to it, I want to keep my primary doctor because there's no way i'm going to go through another three years without gaining one. um but I guess you know no time like the present."
289.0,Provider,"I mean, I recommend that for everybody and bret Hart, we can only do so much all so. it's really. You know if you have any other medical issue."
14741.0,Patient,You mean like the issues of any kind.
289.0,Provider,yeah yeah like you're talking about your passion.
14741.0,Patient,"Well, the side I started a new job, a couple weeks ago. and I mean I. I believe it's from the job, but at the same time, when I used to. drink a lot. of it was because of for pain. or. It was for what I thought was a pain reliever but you know, everybody knows that alcohol doesn't reduce the pantages reduces how you feel. towards the pain. But my hands of installing like crazy. so bad that I can't I can't use my thumbs in the mornings. And I don't know if it's related or, though."
289.0,Provider,"yeah that could be many things. So yeah I would definitely recommend primary care for that to. All we have to do like. Testing sites that. Sometimes it is related to like alcohol and you're listening stuff, so I think we could also see how it goes they might this calm down also."
14741.0,Patient,occurs.
289.0,Provider,Do you take any medication.
14741.0,Patient,i'm right now i'm taking just over the counter like. thousand milligrams of tylenol and at least 1200 milligrams of ibuprofen a day.
289.0,Provider,"Every day. Okay Okay, and for your hands."
14741.0,Patient,for everything. Everything okay.
289.0,Provider,"yeah just be careful, I usually say try not to take those medicines more than 10 days in a row, because they will reset your pain receptors in your brain so after a while your body starts to feel more pain. Until you get that out of your system."
14741.0,Patient,So you might want to take.
289.0,Provider,"A break here and there, yeah so you're not everyday."
14741.0,Patient,stuff more than 10 days.
289.0,Provider,"yeah you gotta kind of reset your brain I think every so often. So I might do tylenol only for 10 days, and you can switch to motoring or something like that so you're not doing the same thing that one."
14741.0,Patient,"I was taking it for dental pain, the sweat the to a once the. 400 milligrams I preference 500 milligrams of tylenol at once, and then it makes sure that i'd stayed on that same dose I would take it again after four or five hours."
289.0,Provider,yeah I think that's okay generally it's just not forever. forever yeah. yeah like for any cute that full pain that I think it's an awful.
14741.0,Patient,sure.
289.0,Provider,something to think about.
14741.0,Patient,"Past I would definitely you know if my mouth hurt, I would just. drink. You know, several our drinks alcohol, you know so like the counterbalance. Taking. You know, and it works, to an extent, but it doesn't really work. that's you know that's why i'm here again so."
289.0,Provider,"yeah that's right here, I think it sounds like there's a lot that we can work on, and I think the therapy will be really helpful. Just kind of reset reset your life really. Start fresh and making sure, and then I think you will feel better over time to. Okay well do you have any questions for me."
14741.0,Patient,"I don't I imagine that you're. worried, where do you live."
289.0,Provider,"i'm in contra Costa county. yeah. yeah we have people from basically anywhere in California, and I agree. yeah so you might I don't know if I have any idea right now."
14741.0,Patient,You should talk. To.
289.0,Provider,Costa so it's near the San Francisco area.
14741.0,Patient,"yeah my grandma lives in livermore. yeah. And so it goes up throughout the bay, but."
289.0,Provider,"Okay, can. We do is we have you come in, once a week or virtually to our group meeting Okay, and then they'll they're going to contact you after this to find you a group. fun if you're with me i'm on Wednesday afternoon. But anything that works for your time is good and then outside of that you'll be setting up one on one appointments also with your therapist OK. So for any of you said you want to continue your medicine and that's also when we do results at the group meetings. yeah anything, no."
14741.0,Patient,i'm good.
