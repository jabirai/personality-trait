298.0,Provider,"I tend to be a person who avoids conflict, and if you give me conflict, all I want to do is go to bed and sleep, how do you deal with conflict."
17859.0,Patient,"I mean, is a mix. Sometimes I wanna sleep, sometimes I pace. yeah and it's kind of a. All over more. It makes my anxiety go crazy and. And yeah either puts me to sleep or. makes me run around like chicken Hello. So just depends."

298.0,Provider,Okay. Sam.
17859.0,Patient,"I. guess my high. would be a. not really a Karen what people think about. or people like not understanding me or hating on me around their opinions. I mean unhealthy manner, like people that like judge you I just whenever I got out of prison. I was a I came to a point my mind roads, like a two I care too much about if I was being too harsh with people or too opinionated or stuff like that, where I just stopped expressing myself as much as I like to. And I don't know i've just found the healthy like. In between, and I realized that this week there's just like. A realization I guess that i'm more comfortable with being myself again and not being so worried about what other people think about it. So that was good feel."
298.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
17859.0,Patient,"and low I guess would be. Just a. Certain people that. I don't talk to anymore, because I was over. I mean it's like. The same the same low that I had last time I talk to you it's like. Almost is like now that i'm sobers like people that I care about are still fucked up and. When I read and try to talk to them about it, or like a you can get help to they're like totally not on that level at all, just like what the Fuck every now. Oh that's so."
298.0,Provider,"It is love and sometimes I mean correct me if i'm wrong but, as you get healthier, you can see, the more root of their addictions like you can see what's bringing them down. yeah, whether it be shame or family problems or loneliness or. I mean there's so many routes to addictions that. You guys are."
17859.0,Patient,"deceived like people are just like. They try to act like. there's nothing wrong. yeah. you're like. Well there's obviously something wrong yeah they're fucking dirtbags if you're a. If you're acting like that, and you know it's like a like a certain friend of mine she's been through a lot like got a. Sex trafficked in. These horrible things have happened to her, she got molested as a child, and she says she doesn't carry any kind of. Any kind of remorse or guilt or anything for it, but then she's out there, using and sell in her body like. I want to try to talk to her about it, she was like there's nothing wrong with me, I feel great and it's like."
298.0,Provider,"You know, you know and it's hard if somebody doesn't see how sexual abuse is a route to addiction if they're if they can't see it. You really can't help them. I think one of the things that I see often here is grief. People have really deep seated grief as one of their roots of addiction that they've not you know."
17859.0,Patient,"Address maybe that's one of the. event, even if there's like other see of things like that's really rude. briefing you know."
298.0,Provider,"it's paying yeah. And you know any of any of the abuses physical abuse. Sexual abuse. mental abuse emotional abuse um. What else would there be even spiritual abuse, I mean those abuses are very deep seated and later in life, you can definitely take and see where where you could attribute some of the addictions to those that type of abuse, would you agree. yeah yeah. very sad, you know, sometimes my job I call myself a story keeper because there I hear so many stories that just are like wow people are hurting out there there's a lot of hurting people. Thank you for sharing that was that was interesting. Okay Ryan."

17859.0,Patient,"I just I love space, and especially the the theories around black holes and should and gravity and what. You know how little we know about it, how it had been space and time. So kind of revolved around that."

17859.0,Patient,"So, and my low was having to end my relationship with my boyfriend i'm glad I did it, it was just a hard thing to do. to actually put it in motion it's been ending for a while, but to actually cut them off completely and off of social media and phone and everything so."
298.0,Provider,yeah. And not easy.
17859.0,Patient,"No, but it was easier than I thought it would be, it was just something I had to do from for myself so."
298.0,Provider,"What do you guys think of this that addiction is a disease, do you agree with that, or do you believe that addiction, because there's others that believe that addiction is a choice."
17859.0,Patient,"I believe it's a disease, but I also believe this and choice to get treatment for it."
298.0,Provider,"Okay, so you sit more on the disease side that therapy can help this disease. Okay, I like that what. Are you all let's see a show of hands who's Garrett things that it's a disease raise your hand. Okay, what did what did Stephen say."
17859.0,Patient,"Oh, even Stevens a vulcan."
298.0,Provider,Okay.
17859.0,Patient,"He was a he was a. Training by the CIA, to be a SAS and so he didn't really say much or do much. he's a trained killer yes. I do it. words. point out my gosh. trained and trained in the article probably. See. i'll be sitting there talking to him cooking on the stove and i'm like seeing all this stuff just waiting for reporting and just keep talking. i'll make more comments more comments waiting for something and he's just looking at me okay say something just something everyone's laughing. Right."
298.0,Provider,So I have a question how has your. relationship changed from when you first started using a substance that has gotten you to where you are what's changed what changed in you. With that relationship with the substance.
17859.0,Patient,"There was no relationship with myself, since I was using it."
298.0,Provider,Okay did it change from like when you first started using it. The amount of times that you used it. What you thought of how you used it how how have things changed from the first time you used to where you are today.
17859.0,Patient,I would trigger I don't really want to talk about it.
298.0,Provider,Okay that's fair. You don't have to.
17859.0,Patient,"Are we are we going in a row, or is anybody talking."
298.0,Provider,anybody can talk I don't want to. I don't want to trigger you guys but.
17859.0,Patient,"It wasn't it wasn't a necessity for me. First, you know first of party, but a necessity to get things done. I you know I needed to get things done so I needed to use that That said, when you get it that. Then it became a way of coffee what's the situation with being homeless with not getting anything done it just coping to delve a pain to stay sane to where you are now. I can stay sane without it, I can get stuff done without. That kind of. Time."
298.0,Provider,So that's that's huge progress. Huge.
17859.0,Patient,"And, and knowing that I can do things and function. And coke without it. is a huge step, but if I ever think about faltering i've realized I don't need that crutch it's not what I need because i'm living proof right now that i'm doing 73 so."
298.0,Provider,good job. that's awesome so you have definitely changed the way you're thinking towards. What you need. it's completely changed him. And it's not a necessity love it. anybody else want to share how their relationship has changed from the first time they use to what it is now anybody want to share. Your story.
17859.0,Patient,"yeah so uh. Whenever I first started using. Drugs when I was a kid it was started off as a smoking weed. I was a. My brothers and sisters are all older than me and they thought it was cute to give me we now call when I was young, and I loved we bought from the first time I tried it now on our women feel, but I was never like an addict type back then I didn't feel like I was anyways but. I liked doing hallucinogens when I was younger I sold them and I took a lot of them, but I didn't need them. But so as later years came after I had a. Accident not far from here up in crescent city I hit a Redwood tree we run road trip from Florida, and I lost. My first love, I was trapped in the car with her face to face with there was a stairwell was shoved in her to her chest, and the blood was pouring out of her mouth and. She was you know I remember vividly like you know, like even like blood spit bubbles and just for this horrible experience, and I could. I felt helpless to do anything, and then I was crushed to and, but it was just really, really traumatic experience with grief and after that is whenever. My drug addiction started I started drinking and I started drinking all the time to get fucked up because I realized that I didn't have to feel that grief anymore, and then it went from just you know not needed it and being. You know just happy with or without it to I needed it all the time to feel okay and. psychotropics didn't help me that much I didn't like the way they made me feel. And even if I stayed on them for amount of time I didn't like them. And, but drugs did help and I started doing math and but whenever I really got into my. addiction is one of our I found opiates it was an oxy cotton. And desperate ever it just got out of control, with a needing it all the time, I can never get enough and. I was always chasing that rush of. From the needle. I would i'm the type of person that will have my dope in my pocket for hours being dope sick before I have to be like Okay, I have to snort it or I have to smoke it because i'm addicted more to that rush than anything because it's just the closest thing that i've ever found to. Just. Straight euphoria. You know there's nothing that compares to the feeling of that rush nothing. Not set, I mean the only thing that does compared to it would be like sex, you know, like an orgasm but that. And like whenever i'm on heroin if you gave me the choice between one or the other, I would pick the hair. So there's nothing like that ever compared to that rush, you know, and after that is that's whenever I truly do what addiction was. Is whenever I got addicted to the Russia the Needle, and then it just got to where I can never get enough and that's. that's whenever I really realized, I was an addict and that I wouldn't do anything, besides Selma because you know, whenever you get hooked on heroin and that rush you're either going to sell your body when it comes down to it, or you're gonna rob somebody. There so it's either one of those choices if you're down and out, then you really need it and you're that willing to get it and i've watched tons of people that have come to that point whether that addicted do one or the other. You know that's how thinking it is so that's that's just how addicted that's how my addiction is just Brown. From you know bad to just worse out of control, you know I especially with the death bang and then whenever I got married and had my kids and then. I was sober for a while and she wasn't willing to work with me on it as a as a disease like state whatever she left me out so for six months and I relapsed and it wasn't even a hard to relapse she just woke up in snot out all my breath. But now that I know what her she's a very narcissistic person, but whenever she left me. That grief I couldn't handle that grief either so within grief, on top of. That death and her leaving me is whenever I really got out of control and just didn't care about my life of all. interests were just. All I had or. What I chose."
298.0,Provider,"I I really appreciate you talking, thank you, that was very transparent i'm curious also how, how are you confronting those painful memories what's what's working for you you're not using drums what's working for you now."
17859.0,Patient,"just learning how to change. My thoughts and. I realizing that I dwell on those negative things just like we talked about last week that 8% of our thoughts are negative now on really just like focusing on whenever on what would be a. Recognizing it. And realizing that that's what i'm doing is i'm dwelling on it on negative things and whenever I do realize that tell myself you don't gotta do that you don't sit there and think that should. have been some people, they want to, they want to let go of it, you know, like they just want to romanticize with the pain, I guess, just hold on to it, because they don't want to leave behind like if some kind of dear precious gem. that's how i'm dealing with personal. it's just recognizing it and changing it."
298.0,Provider,"love that um anybody else want to chime in on the front page, how do you confront painful memories painful emotions."
17859.0,Patient,"So. First off, I mean different. yeah I mean that's what i've done over the years i'm trying to be more outspoken well my ship. out really know what what to do yet that's why I was trying trying it out."
298.0,Provider,"I think. that's 99% of us is we're just trying things out finding out what works for us, I love that. You know, there is a bit of a dopamine release that comes with getting it out of your mouth, you know letting people know you know, this is what i'm upset about this is what i'm grieving. Instead of holding it in which, if you can get dope for me to release in your brain that's you know that's a feeling of of wellness. So the for you Ryan good answer. Does anyone else have a story of how things have changed from the for them for their relationship with the first time they use to where they are now."
17859.0,Patient,"My guys here we go how. Well, I started, by having fun it definitely progressed a lot into me just using it as a crutch to not feel. And and progress like that, over and over again would be like a cycle and stop for a week and then just go back down per week and. get worse and worse and yeah so. it's pretty much in a nutshell. I was one of those people you don't like a very young kid didn't even really know what drugs were exactly I am. I I wanted to. I wanted to use drugs and I romanticize the idea of it before I never tried it. I don't know why now it's from. 11 to 12 years old, I started doing like 13. yeah drugs have always been a part of my part of my life. Whether it was you know be raising me or a brand so."
298.0,Provider,"Do you guys find that you're having more emotions, the further and further you get into your sobriety."
17859.0,Patient,Yes.
298.0,Provider,"Do you feel like you're in a safe place to to go through those emotions. Sometimes, sometimes sometimes. And one of the things that I do here at breitbart health is I type train people off of benzodiazepines that would be like San X out of ban those type of medicine."
17859.0,Patient,volume clock in.
298.0,Provider,"Exactly we have. It. I mean, this is a little off topic, but I won't admit somebody to my caseload who is using those from the street, because it's so easy for someone who knows how to get those off the street. For me to do with hydration is a waste of their time in my time because they'll just supersede me when I start doing the tie trading down. And they can't get it from me they'll go to the street, to get it and i've had no success, so I won't take any street tight stay tight integrations anymore. Anyway, that was a little off topic, but I do do temptations of benzodiazepines and one of the things that I watch for. Is because you start decreasing the benzo they start having a lot more emotions and start feeling things. And if they have not had the counseling to deal with the root problems, then we've got another problem on our hands like there it's there, all of a sudden, they start feeling everything because you're taking away the. drains from them."
17859.0,Patient,"yeah that's a. Actually, from beyond heroin and Ben does for so long. My emotions are not been done as a opiates my emotions are so like almost like. buyer you know I mean it's like. What you know what I just like sitting with them is so are just feels like they're just like my whole body's on fire, sometimes."
298.0,Provider,"Exactly that's exactly what i'm talking about that if you've gotten such a if you've learned to shut that part of your brain off and then you've got to start feeling it it really takes some work. But we don't want people to really be looking for help, I mean it's hard to do counseling when people are still on medication, because we need them to fill feel F G, we need them to feel when we're in counseling not be totally turned off."
17859.0,Patient,So it's called processing your emotions right.
298.0,Provider,yeah we need them to have some emotion and not be so flat. yeah interesting stuff I find it all very fascinating. So let's just move a little bit forward thinking. Anybody want to share anybody want to share a new year's resolution or any goal that they're working on right now and we'll end with that.
17859.0,Patient,Space over. is over. Resolution was changed my thinking.
298.0,Provider,"change your thinking, I like it, have you been studying all the cognitive distortions."
17859.0,Patient,"No, but i've been studying on how techniques, on how to do it, you know. How to keep my mind busy. Just not being idle is a big thing."
298.0,Provider,"Right that's huge not being idle not letting yourself dwell on negative emotions. Not doing black and white thinking. yeah I love to stay sober I think we could everybody raised their hand that's their goal this year. Good one since you're all in rehab. single alright guys i'm gonna let you though anybody wants to stay behind and talk to me, you can."
17859.0,Patient,"Okay, thank you."
298.0,Provider,Thank you bye bye.
17859.0,Patient,you're a. you're a drug it out all counselor. Already.
298.0,Provider,i'm more like a psychiatrist. So i'm the person who does prescribing medications and giving diagnosis first but i'm also the medical director for your facility there and they did not give us a therapist so i'm doing my own therapy.
17859.0,Patient,"Oh, Sir you're the medical director here. I am, did you say that you were an addict at one time."
298.0,Provider,I was not.
17859.0,Patient,"Oh, I thought i'm sorry I thought you said that you."
298.0,Provider,"know, although i'd have to say that is every person were to say that they're not an addict i'd have to say you have tendencies and maybe it's not as substance use it might be a non substances, but we all are having indices. To like wanted to. crave dopa me but no I don't have a background myself."
17859.0,Patient,What What did you say what did you call it the. My working on a DJ and what for for cheat sheet. For.
298.0,Provider,Are you learning cognitive distortions. what's that okay and there's about 10 cognitive. distortions that people have. That it can be.
17859.0,Patient,It just a second. hey Kevin did you want to talk to her about something yeah. After after you explain this to me i'll let him talk to you. I love it needs to get something office just.
298.0,Provider,So next week i'll introduce the 10 different cognitive distortions it's like black and white thinking romanticizing. And will we did it a couple months ago we went over cognitive distortions and we use it we look for examples in your thinking that. Was we.
17859.0,Patient,"Basically that's like 10 different ways to. recognize what you're doing. Exactly. Like, if you like, it do that's that's cool because that's what i'm trying to do is like recognize my. What i'm doing like what you said, a black and white, the thinking romanticizing you know and another thing that I realized that i'm doing is i'm thinking about females too much whenever i'm not in the position to even be thinking about anything like that right now. stuff like that is like i'm starting you know it's like I don't want to let go of some things because it's an addiction in itself as well you know what I mean."
298.0,Provider,It was dope.
17859.0,Patient,mean it comes with the you know. Right now i'm starting to recognize. Those things.
298.0,Provider,"So, if you would do me a favor and tell the people in group if they would research, the dip the 10 different cognitive distortions, so that we can talk about them next week. That would be like fortune telling jumping to conclusions minimizing people minimize all the time or then catastrophizing or they say Oh, I should have done this, you know and they miss label things Those are all part of the cognitive distortions."
17859.0,Patient,"Okay, so, but can I can Google it the 10 cognitive distortions. awesome cool Thank you."
