15308.0,Patient,"I have a psychiatrist through the va that's partially i'm a combat fat, so that a lot of that attributed to my demise. i've reached out to the va I worked with a psychiatrist there but it's very slow moving. And even a crisis appointment doesn't get scheduled until and they scheduled or crisis appointments it doesn't get scheduled until like a month out so."

15308.0,Patient,Now my not so us. I wish I was.
298.0,Provider,And I feel bad at a day when. Somebody is in crisis.
15308.0,Patient,"it's been rough because i've i've been spiraling and i've been reaching out to them and it's just not been sufficient so they do prescribe my medication it's your Regiment i've been on for a while that historically has worked. I might need something different now. as per the doctor from Lawson siena's who only really spent an accumulative hour with me so i'm a little wary about his scripts i'm willing to try something new, but. Based off the information he's able to gather in that short amount of time I don't know if he knows me well enough. But i'm just very. Not quick to try to just fill myself up with minutes. Okay, so."
298.0,Provider,Because ptsd is a super hard. thing to even treat with medication.
15308.0,Patient,"Right, which is why i'm pursuing an alternative care Center we're waiting to hear back on whether or not they take try care."
298.0,Provider,which I believe in do it's called first responders first. So I like it.
15308.0,Patient,"it's really a good plan, I feel really optimistic about it. it's been. A lot of things that sent me into the spiral and. done so in a safe place by. yeah by a population that understands that kind of Sharma."
298.0,Provider,All 100%.
15308.0,Patient,"And that's really important to me so, especially in light of the current events that we're inundated with his combat that's right now I served in Afghanistan so it's really. been overwhelming. to the point where I couldn't really differentiate fact from negativity anymore and and that's what led to the incident. upon other things, but ultimately. predominantly what sent me spiraling."
298.0,Provider,"Okay, and so I need Could you give me a little bit more detail, did you suicide, how did you attempt it."
15308.0,Patient,I took both bottles of my sleeping pills.
298.0,Provider,"Okay, and what were the names of your sleeping pills."
15308.0,Patient,"One one's a benzodiazepine which is today's a Pam and one was when I had just started, which was presented in. Aha for night cares."
298.0,Provider,Right.
15308.0,Patient,I had only been on that one like five days without today's a pan. And it did not seem to be effective. So I was really disappointed about that.
298.0,Provider,"Sorry, so what are you on right now."
15308.0,Patient,"i'm currently was prescribed. today's a Pam and Dexter amphetamine for ADHD since I returned home from overseas, and I was prescribed that before deploying and it has been a really great regimen but right now, since getting out of the hospital, you must be take. capital for. penton know gabba trill yeah I said that too, because I was like i'm not interested in fashion. yeah gabba trill. If I understand correctly, is to address what he believes, I have called a condition like PM rl or something and it's like Russell SLIM movement during sleep affiliated with ADHD and night terrors. Oh it's almost above my pay grade. I was, I was surprised. That they have this drug and I hadn't heard of it, because it seems really almost too good to be true, because it doesn't it's not a benzo so it addresses alpha intrusion and rem cycle and allegedly not habit for me. Can you i'm so curious about this drug."
298.0,Provider,let's try and let me look it up. turn help me spell it.
15308.0,Patient,I think it's G a B a i'm not sure if it's two b's so let's try GA EA T ri l I could go get the script when i'm afraid. i'm activity.
298.0,Provider,"you're there that gap betrayal yes. Okay okay it's an anti-convulsants medication, which would make sense that it. Right restless leg. Right, let me pull my site book here. Sure, and i'm your stories interesting keep going."
15308.0,Patient,"Thank you. So he the past couple of nights that it really felt like I was locked up, it was not conducive environment for my treatment, really. It. I was on it and I don't really know how effective it is because my roommate was skits Franek sure. I didn't really sleep well both nights and i'm used to i'm used to living alone up until I moved in with my boyfriend recently. And I don't sleep, while. Not alone, so it was really tough to determine whether it was effective or not, but I did end up having to take an Anti anxiety as well, and I think knocked me out, but I really I really don't want to have to take it. it's out of rats or something you're at it at it."
298.0,Provider,yeah it's a cousin to benadryl.
15308.0,Patient,It is a.
298.0,Provider,yeah it's not it's an Anti histamine.
15308.0,Patient,"Oh really no wonder, I wasn't confident. I had a lot of. Congestion probably from chain smoking from stress. A high. yeah I came back negative from my coven test which was a plus but i'm still coffee and it's a scary thing to be enduring in the midst of a pandemic."
298.0,Provider,Right yeah and everybody looks at you like he's. gonna let her see um.
15308.0,Patient,For sure.
298.0,Provider,Oh yeah what's. So you mentioned you're living with your boyfriend is he's. going.
15308.0,Patient,"So a lot of things are changing and my boyfriend is the one that saved my life. This has been really traumatic for him. In many ways, even seeing the spiral and turn. into a different person was really traumatic for him. Because he's historically set on the strongest person he knows, so he also has his own trauma, so this is all the really triggering for him. And when I got released from the hospital he did warn me that a lot of the stuff out of the House would be moved. And he. is still in communication with me, but he needs time. And I need time. To get my head straight. And we're just taking it day by day I don't know that we will withstand this into, but I hope so, because he's my best friend. But it's really hard to look in the mirror on this one. it's really hard to see that i've caused someone I care about so much pain."
298.0,Provider,"Oh, I can only imagine."
15308.0,Patient,"i'm not home right now I stopped at home to get some stuff to pack in case I do go to this well when I go to this. residential facility, but I might go back there to get my dogs and then bring them to different location. it's overwhelming and it's a drag but I told him I respect his time and his well being just as much as my own, and that I hope we can fix it, I hope I can fix what i've done. or amended and move forward, but ultimately whatever he needs me to do, I am on board with and he's not used to this part of me. Because if I. It all started with him meeting to check into a hotel, because I was having such a bad flashback and alcohol was problem in the mix too. and I came home and you wanted to Shell and. I was not having it. And I started seeing read again and. He was like this is crazy I need to sleep i'm going to check into a hotel and I felt like at that point, I couldn't mend things. And that's. Not top of everything else I lost my grandma. My grandma passed away last month and then before that fourth of July really shouldn't be spiraling because they just moved to La from Prescott Arizona."
298.0,Provider,yeah wow.
15308.0,Patient,"It was not a good time. To move there because the whole Sky was on fire, all the time, and it really triggered me. So. it's been rough and then. I was forced to just chill for a minute because i'm only in the army reserves, and I was between contracts and my civilian jobs and I just had a lot of downtime and I finally had to just. About I finally started experiencing. A lot of flashbacks at that point and realizing that it has totally consumed me, and it was really terrifying to know that, after having not realized it because I lived alone for so many years and then moving in with the love of my life I was like I don't know what to do. So i've jacked up several friendships because i've been so unavailable. And i've heard some loved ones and i've crossed my parents in arm and a leg to come out here from Chicago and deal with my dysfunctions so. I felt really guilty and I don't know. I felt like I couldn't fix it. And I felt like I couldn't fix my brain. And everything felt really dismal and alcohol was a huge influence in that, but it had been. Eating at me for a long time, and it was keep it at bay without alcohol and alcohol exacerbated the whole problem and it just got worse and worse. So, so far, so far and became a thing and then. Self medicating became a things i'll call it wasn't an addiction, but it was every day. yeah. So I don't want to do that, I want to get sober and I want to go to his treatment facility, which seems to really understand the concept of that. All the things that lead to those behaviors. And the value in. A peaceful environment for someone that's have has very complex ptsd. and vocational ptsd. They understand the value of being at peace in integrating back into being stable in a normal society. whatever that means normal society. But that's kind of my backstory on this current situation. I also have i'm not sure if you're familiar with mst military sexual trauma. But I have endured that. Which is affected my relationship, and I have also endured outside trauma the same nature on my way to connecting with my unit to deploy. So everything kind of centers around the military and. it's really hard to stomach on my own."
298.0,Provider,"yeah yeah I I am so happy that you might be going soon to this place and get some help if you after care of that would like to come back to us. Sure don't hesitate to reach out to us and I don't know if we'll be a good fit for you, but. You know we're here if you need us."
15308.0,Patient,"yeah right now i'll take any support that efficient that I can get. I really like your bedside manner so. The very way more personable than people i've met with it the va out here, so I had a great team impressive, but there are other outside factors that were also pretty traumatizing that kind of pushed me to immediately move to La so. It was there was a drag I lost that team, and you know, in a city this big I don't get the kind of care that I need."
298.0,Provider,"I don't this has never happened to me but you're choking me up. pain, I have, I have a daughter, who served in Afghanistan. And and she's in the army, right now, and she's phone now she's she's stationed in Washington. i'm wondering how much do I not know. jack has."
15308.0,Patient,"guess my parents had no idea, they had no idea. They had an idea towards the the. the height of the incident, because my boyfriend call them in a crisis crisis leading up to the final I hope the final crisis, I know the final crisis because my head's already clearing. This was a hard look in the mirror, I mean when you're locked up, you have one of two ways to go about it in a facility like that you can sit and meditate and really look at what. A mess you've made and how you can start slowly cleaning up. and cleaning up your mind, or you can just be better and i'm tired of being bitter but my parents didn't know and i'm not one to really be kind of beaten into you not to reach out for help, and when you do and it's not sufficient it's like. it's a steak it really."
298.0,Provider,yeah yeah for you've got a lot going on.
15308.0,Patient,yeah I do have a lot going on.
298.0,Provider,So what methods are you actually taking.
15308.0,Patient,I have a script right now for the gab betrayal and the Ad or whatever I might take it as needed since i'm going to be in a strange environment. um. But I want to get off of that eventually. And then obviously I have no more prison or tomatoes or Pam because we all know what happened there.
298.0,Provider,yeah.
15308.0,Patient,and Oh sorry go ahead.
298.0,Provider,"The the personal son would have lowered your blood pressure and bottom two out that's what that is is a blood pressure medication. Anyway, you were gonna say about the adderall or."
15308.0,Patient,"The adderall I should be okay on until. dots the one I don't have the most of. Because I refilled it before I got the garbage or the prison. yeah. And then i'm also on micro justin for. me endometriosis the end to end. and That i'm going to need a refill on and i'm not sure how to go about that, with the va because they're so slow moving and I have to, I have to go to this facility, but i'm a little afraid it's going to hinder my progress if I get. On the rag again and experience endometriosis symptoms."
298.0,Provider,"Ah, you know I don't know how to prescribe that because i'm i'm mental help. I wish I could help you. But that's okay. it's okay not my it's not my domain."
15308.0,Patient,that's okay okay.
298.0,Provider,"All right, well, good luck and. I hope things improve."
