148.0,Provider,Good Thank you how. Have you been since we last met individually.
17078.0,Patient,"i'm good i've been doing really good yeah I mean I feel like the group sessions are really working as well, too, and the dialogue that happens after. It seems like it it's like the right amount of people or the right mixture of people, and it seems really good so yeah I get a lot out of it."
148.0,Provider,"i'm so glad to hear that back, thank you."
17078.0,Patient,yeah no worries.
148.0,Provider,Is this. Your first time in a group.
17078.0,Patient,"Yes, i've never been in a group."
148.0,Provider,So group sessions are really powerful because. You always you're never in the same place as the next person right you're never in your recovery or you know going through exactly the same things but there's also so many similarities.
17078.0,Patient,yeah there's a lot of similarities.
148.0,Provider,yeah so much learning opportunity and group sessions.
17078.0,Patient,"yeah which is. I think the most I guess the most similarities, I noticed is that I have like Olympic dema gout on my my leg my left ankle. And it tends to go to my right leg as well, too, and I noticed that there was quite a few of the ladies that were mentioning that that they have that. And I don't know if they had a traumatic ankle injury or foot injury like I did and that's why we're all experiencing the same thing, but it definitely. It was definitely very alarming to me that we all had the same thing, like. You know, after this traumatic injury, then it goes to the swelling of the leg and the swelling. Is excruciating but was worse is when, after the swelling of comes down it's like it puts so much pressure on the bone it's like really bad so. it's just amazes me how because nobody ever told me when I was in theaters here hey you're going to have a traumatic you have a tremendous foot injury now you're going to have X, Y amp Z but It just seems like we all have the same thing. The same exact same thing with a gout or the the cellulitis or. limp edema so weird."
148.0,Provider,yeah it's almost reassuring to know that you're not alone.
17078.0,Patient,Right right. There like.

I related so much with him, because I was like. He was talking, I was like oh my God is he understand like somebody understands my pain so deep in the bone it's nothing you can rub out so it's a horrible feeling so horrible yeah."
