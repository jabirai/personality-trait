298.0,Provider,"Okay, and. who's the loft. Has there been talked about going up on them so."
14221.0,Patient,"Many, many times and now psychiatry's have done that."
298.0,Provider,Oh. So you have somebody else who's prescribing that medicine for you.
14221.0,Patient,"know I come from Argentina and i've been on the treatment, since 2018 I got to the States. Three four months, and before that I had many, many psychiatrists because I felt none of them were helping me achieving the goal of understanding what's happening to me or give me a full diagnose and Helen me with a medication, because I feel and I noticed. Without the appeal of the medication i'm not able to sleep well. And so I came. With so yes."
298.0,Provider,"So i'm prescribing the ambien to you, am I going to be prescribing the zoloft to you now."
14221.0,Patient,If you're. I mean. to you.
298.0,Provider,"Oh well, this is somebody else prescribing it to you."
14221.0,Patient,Not at the moment you're the only one.
298.0,Provider,"Okay that's what I wanted to know, are you willing to go up on it, because it's not very high."
14221.0,Patient,"I mean, I thought it was to live in La to co op because i'm doctors told me today, maybe. it's been a long time since i've been taking that and it could be turned into an addiction and I i'm concerned about it, to be honest."
298.0,Provider,"It. It doesn't have to sell loft is not something that is the body doesn't get addicted to zoloft body, the body gets addicted to the ambien. ambien is the one that really concerns me. Because that's a big gun and it's really a big gun it's just big it's a big medicine."
14221.0,Patient,"They have seen similar names, but this extra Lena I call it said turning customer that's got any Spanish but has solved I."
298.0,Provider,yeah.
14221.0,Patient,I don't know. yeah that's I don't know.
298.0,Provider,The same thing start to lean and so laughter the same name and you're taking certainly at 50 milligrams and usually you see certainly go higher if a person's. not getting better we go higher on it until we start seeing improvement if there's no improvement and you go higher than you go lower and you try something else.
14221.0,Patient,"And let's improving. Worse, to frame not improving and improving."
298.0,Provider,You if you felt that um. If you felt like you were less sad had were less anxious. Then you would be improving. If you worried less than you would be improving. So if you're less depressed that's how we measure it does that answer your question. yeah OK.
14221.0,Patient,"So the only way. that we can continue the treatment, but have this set up on my way, I never have problems. Getting in shape even exercising and I feel it's harder."
298.0,Provider,Okay.
14221.0,Patient,"Well i'm taking the medication is, I have never taken any pills, not even for headaches until the treatment and. It gets harder. For me to be in shape. In something that concerns me and. it's a cycle, because it makes me sad makes me depressed and makes me not want to be. Myself, because I don't recognize myself to make sense. Okay, secure, but this is also a sickness for me."
298.0,Provider,At this moment right right. And i'm. Here is what I recommend. let's leave this circling leave it the same. Because it treats serotonin this time and then add a medication that treats dopa mean dopa mean will give you more energy focus motivation you don't have anything like that happening on your machine right now. What are your thoughts.
14221.0,Patient,What.
298.0,Provider,I know you don't like why.
14221.0,Patient,"No i'm just I take the medication that's necessary to control the. feeling see my head i'm concerned about my physical health, then what the things that I. cannot control over the medication, the side effects or the secondary effects."
298.0,Provider,"So wellbutrin will help combat weight gain because it gives you energy and so well wellbutrin is actually. it's used in some weight loss medicines, because people start feeling more energetic with it the downside to wellbutrin is, if you are one of those people who. get more anxious on the medicine, if you get anxious on the medicine, then it's not the right medicine for you, but a lot of times it's it's just what people are needing because they haven't been treating the dopa mean."
14221.0,Patient,yeah no I don't I don't wanna I just want to take out no I i'm not gonna. race my health anymore wait side and stuff I. When I take.
298.0,Provider,"Okay, so I heard you say no, you don't want to try well. Okay gotcha. Okay, what would you like to do."
14221.0,Patient,Natural things.
298.0,Provider,"Okay, have you. gone through with nature pathak doctor."
14221.0,Patient,I don't know what that is.
298.0,Provider,um there's a natural doctor it's called the innate nature path and they do natural things.
14221.0,Patient,I. it's an association see.
298.0,Provider,"They probably have some association, but they're not like regular medical doctors they're more into natural things. Okay, they don't have maybe you should look into one of those is what i'm suggesting. It might be what what would help you so would you like me to refill your medications for you the zoloft at 50 milligrams and the ambient."
14221.0,Patient,I don't know i'm not a doctor to know how the treatment has to continue.
298.0,Provider,So you just told me that you don't want to do any new medication.
14221.0,Patient,know him.
298.0,Provider,"And i'm asking you, if you want me to continue the medication you're already on."
14221.0,Patient,"Well he's continuing education, I know he has also any faith in every bump. Failing so i'm counting on you to let me know if I have to continue or lowering the amount or doing gradually I haven't studied psychology or psychiatry. Studies I don't know how to tell you like, yes, I want to go and then it's contra towson. that's what i'm here to listen to you. Are you able to help me with this decision. As I can feel you not getting an answer and I don't know if you need an answer from me to get an answer from you. But that's the case. I don't know that i'm doing. To actually."
298.0,Provider,"OK, I can feel we're frustrated you word i'm trying to recommend something that you said now and so i'm like okay well, what is it that you really want. And if you want to continue what you're on I can do that if you don't want to continue what you're on I can stop that. I need to know what you would like to do, are you sick you i've already suggested a medication to work on dopa mean you've said no. you're currently on certainly an ambien one is for sleep one is for depression and what I hear you saying is. I don't know I don't know if i'm supposed to continue if I take those away you're going to have a hard time sleeping if you don't have the ambien if you don't have the zoloft you're not getting any serotonin which makes the depression worse."
14221.0,Patient,"But that's what i'm saying I don't know. it's like managing my treatment managing the dosages in medication, where I can decide at this moment West managed for for me is to decide to not add more medication just because I want to feel. That i'm not adding more pressure me the signing more education, you know what I mean like to fix this one pill to fix this one pill to fix this one, I rather continue. With an attrition is or a society and for all the things since she's told me that that's what I supposed to do to reach out for help outside the session. By within the session I expect you to tell me, I suggest, for example, then you continue with me and I you continue or I suggest that we lower the dosage of. solo and i'll say yes, I will i'll follow your suggestion, because if I if I said to me i'll say, of course, no medication who wants to follow medication so who has to have pills, to take in their body what i'm saying is I need an icon here in two part of."
298.0,Provider,"killing them now recommending. i'm not recommending that you go off of this medication. I recommend that you stay the same, if you want to go find a nature path provider a doctor who does just natural things you're free to do that on your own."
14221.0,Patient,"yeah no, I know I can do that for. The way for gaining weight what i'm saying is right now, at this moment i'm under to medication and it's not going to be healthy and it's not going to be. appropriate for me to say, I want to discontinue from today because that's not something that a doctor would say or recommend. Some hearing say I want to hear your suggestion, whether we lowered the dosage for we'd already quantity during the week or during the day that's what i'm here but i'm not under sequences and when I say. I don't want to take this medication from today, just like that, because many doctors have told me that that's not possible, and they cannot do that, even if the patient says, I don't want to take it anymore so i'm kind of confused. about which answer you're looking for, or what kind of. Or are you looking for me."
298.0,Provider,"Okay, very confused."
14221.0,Patient,By you're saying.
298.0,Provider,"Okay i'm. i'm asking. I think you and I are on the same page, and I think i'm i'm saying I don't want you to go down on your medicines and I don't want you to stop your medicines."
14221.0,Patient,"Okay, then dusty acid so. Okay, you already know, then. That we have to continue for the treatment so. i'm confused, why are you asking me this question about if I want to not continue with the medication when you know that I shouldn't shouldn't."
298.0,Provider,"Because that is a question I always ask my patients is is what would you like to do where where can I help you with this so. It may be just a difference in style, this is usually how I react, this is how I interact i'm going what are, what are your problems, and do you see yourself doing this and, just like you said no, I don't want to add a medication, I made a recommendation, you said no so."
14221.0,Patient,"yeah I pray for I understand. I can understand because it's something new and I haven't taken it I haven't. got used to it so it's easy to say no, obviously, but they want that i'm taking scenes almost two years. it's difficult for me to think that I should be able to say no, you know what I mean. that's why i'm kind of confused so, of course, Sir, at this moment for your question about that now, then you want by the one that i'm being my body has been all my immune system has been used to far away."
298.0,Provider,Okay. So I am refilling your so loft and your ambien.
14221.0,Patient,All right.
298.0,Provider,"Okay, I am done you're good to go."
