And she put it in in the morning, I went around four o'clock hoping it would be there and I was so mad because it wasn't even ready and i'm sicker than a dog and i'm waiting and waiting and waiting for my prescription so they're like unreliable so. You know when Arthur has a medicine there I get it, but I, you know I don't have to get it right, then, and there.
