726.0,Provider,"Can you hear me, yes, can you hear me."
13697.0,Patient,"I can hear you now. Oh well, you can't see me, can you."
726.0,Provider,know I cannot.
13697.0,Patient,Let me see your share screen no and that's. what's weird.
726.0,Provider,"it's right next to the mute button, all the way in the bottom. of your left. All right. sorry about that. It was my computer, I think it was something on my computer so."
13697.0,Patient,you're an expert. So how are you doing.
726.0,Provider,"i'm good i'm good, how are you doing I haven't seen you I was checking on your chart since August 30 I think."
13697.0,Patient,"Right that's amazing. yeah I missed a meeting because of i'm in a different time zone, and I was confused on time, the time. I thought that I, I had the ties on down right but I guess wrong, so I missed something."
726.0,Provider,that's okay um how have you been doing since the last time I saw you.
13697.0,Patient,"i'm doing okay. I was, I feel a little more sluggish than it was before all this. happened, you know, like I got to that manic. stage where I was. kind of felt like I was on top of the world, you know in control of everything and it's almost the opposite and not not the opposite, but i'm not. i'm not as sharp as I would like to be I feel kind of sluggish and so yeah that's kind of out other than that it's been fun."
726.0,Provider,"Okay, and. The damn thing is, do you feel like the sluggishness is. Partly in the anything related to medications or just in general you're just feeling sluggish."
13697.0,Patient,"I would like to think I was it said it's got to be the medication I don't think it's I don't I never felt like this way before this is kind of i've gone from one extreme to the other. and With the only thing I could think of it'd be different in that respect, I mean i'll feel depressed I just feel kind of dopey you know i'm talking a lot more kind of. Well, I mean it was an extreme case, where I was before the manic state, I was talking so fast, and you know I sit on top of the world, but yeah so I, the only thing I could think of as medication, maybe just seems to be fine tune."
726.0,Provider,"Oh, how long you manic episode, for how long. Were you feeling that way."
13697.0,Patient,feeling the way I am right now How long have I.
726.0,Provider,been when you said you were feeling manic how.
13697.0,Patient,"It wasn't for very long, I mean maybe a week or two and that's when I was in hospital, as I hospitalized see I wouldn't have had a hard time saying that word before. that's kind of I feel like my tongue is thicker than it should be, you know i'm stumbling over. Words and. And yeah, but we have for that, I would say, maybe it was two to four weeks that I was in that manic state."
726.0,Provider,and You said when hospital was is that.
13697.0,Patient,"We I mean I was put I turned myself in and was in a 5051. board for three days and then for 14 days I was. A behavior hospital. And they found medication to give me to sleep at night that was one of my problems, so I was manic I was, I was staying awake all night on it. Or we got any sleeping well. So they finally got it, where I was medicated enough to sleep, but I kind of think that the medication that could be described is getting me to sleep. i'm getting a lot more sleep than ever did before, which is good, but I just don't feel 100% I guess what i'm trying to say."
726.0,Provider,"How long. How long have you been feeling, not a short."
13697.0,Patient,"pretty much since I left facility so it's been well over a month, and so I mean I just. yeah it's it's been over a month, but at least site i've been sleeping. And i'm not. i'm not thinking that i'm a master of the universe anymore."
726.0,Provider,"So, now that. Now that you're home, it looks like you're holding in your space and everything. um How has it been with your wife, and you know kind of because i'm remembering talking about some projects house."
13697.0,Patient,yeah we were waiting for house we've built and so we're we've been living in a. trailer for the last lessons by June and we're actually doing a trip right now we're going all the way back from California Arizona to. New York where we're in Ohio right now and that's that's our project for right now don't have any chances to do like like real hobbies like woodworking and no fixing up the House I just we're just basically traveling which is nice it's we're having a good time.
726.0,Provider,"With your. phone with your wife, for a long time was she bought a pointed out when you were on manic or was it something that came to your own awareness that you were in the matrix thing."
13697.0,Patient,"I think I noticed at first, but then she started realizing that there was something different. and actually it was her her saying you need to get help. Because something's not right and that that forced me to to to. Turn myself in I know it was kind of a weird situation we were we were not near home, so I couldn't just go see my doctor, so I I. actually turned myself into the police, because. It wasn't really any other alternative where we were at and that's how I got into. And then into the to the behavioral health facility. So, but she did she knew something was wrong, it took her a little longer than me I think she just thought I was kind of hyper and not hyper manic. That, I think, after a while she realized. Something was I needed help."
726.0,Provider,And how did you find your experience when we were in there.
13697.0,Patient,I say that again.
726.0,Provider,How did you find that experience when you were in there in the behavioral health net.
13697.0,Patient,"It was. It was very I don't know I wouldn't want to experience it again. But I wasn't really free or upset about it, I just thought if I you know they were going to help that we're going to provide help for me and. And that's what they did, and I just kind of let let the and just let them do what they needed to do, basically, and I didn't fight it or anything like that I just. went along with the Program."
726.0,Provider,Did you find it helpful at the end when we're done with the program was there anything like that came to that was. Give me some insight or.
13697.0,Patient,"You know it wasn't very head before that there was a real problem that I had. You know I thought that I seem to see a psychiatrist and I was the only thing that upset me was that was taking them so long me being in that facility. I thought i'll just released me and i'll go to a psychiatrist and they'll prescribe the drugs for me, but they know we're gonna we're gonna hold you until we've got you, you know, in a good state and I. So I guess it wasn't until the very end that I realized that yeah there were right, it was something I needed. But. I just think that it went like I said it's gone from very manic to not depressed not anxious just sluggish."
726.0,Provider,Richard for how long have you on. The deal with. This.
13697.0,Patient,"This was the first time ever had this happen. to know people say there's one. It took so long is not only manic. emetic episode using slack in your 20s I never experienced that much to this extent. that's where I could say I can pinpoint yeah I remember that back in when it was my 20th so. This is so it started in July. And I got. To help, I think it was before even i'm i'm sure when I got out of the place, but it was, I think, very beginning of August."
726.0,Provider,So I know that you're traveling on. Do you find you like if you're under a lot of stress it brings up more of the mental health.
13697.0,Patient,"know I I don't think, so I think i've been handling my stress pretty well. With me ask my wife she's in the training room Diana, would you say i'm handling my stress well. yeah. My wife said that you know I the stress that i've experienced has not been where i'm out of control. yeah This is also. That when the things that would have made me really happy in the past. don't really impact me. as much. I don't get us excited i'm kind of. Maybe i'm just more even keeled but. You know kind of flat, I think, is probably a good way of describing it. Just gave me a thumbs up, I feel flat but and it's amazing how much sleep I get like 1011 hours of sleep well I couldn't never slept past five so that's. But the the stress, I really haven't had much I know that when we drive Sometimes I get into a tense situation like I got to make a decision right now neverland my wife tell me don't make a right or left here I don't. give this up. I think that's a good thing um. But it's just at the same time things that I used to be able to figure out without anybody's help I can't figure out after. No, it was really very almost everything was very intuitive to me as far as computers go. And now, my wife is. is to figure out stuff on the computer, for me, I don't that's where I feel like i've kind of got a i've taken dummy pills. So just yeah I don't know it's weird."
726.0,Provider,And then.
13697.0,Patient,"Talking I I don't have a real um. I can hear carry on a conversation a two way conversation very well, I can listen, but when I start to talk I just can't get my point across as easily."
726.0,Provider,"Okay. So it's almost also sounds like your body's just not used. You know where it's at right now, because. yeah I mean How long have you been on medication now for for this."
13697.0,Patient,"How long has it been to another. couple months. get out of the facility. yeah that's right sharing it really reduced it a little bit last call, but apparently For that reason, so yeah so. Maybe made a difference, and I think one thing, she also suggested is take the dopey pedals at night, instead of the first person in the morning really mess pipe day up so that might have helped a little bit it's helped some. More. I think that was that was kind of just going through the motions. before she made that change. Education. Change the time I took but i'm still I don't know. i'm. I am better definitely better, but I kind of hope to eventually get into a better state that i'm in right now."
726.0,Provider,yeah. I was just looking to your chart because I can kind of see. what's there so. It looks like a treasure hunt at night 100 milligrams.
13697.0,Patient,dress it up Davis. Take a day yeah that's what i'm taking it back.
726.0,Provider,"So it might be worth it, you know. Until your next appointment, you can discuss with the way that you're feeling if you're continuing to feel that way if i'm if there's anything you in the psychiatrists can work on to like we are not feeling as drowsy or not, as sharp as you were saying."
13697.0,Patient,Right yeah that's a good work sharp. sharp adult.
726.0,Provider,yeah.
13697.0,Patient,I listened is laughs and Sheena that's a good word bill boring.
726.0,Provider,Richard what were some of the. The behaviors that you were exhibiting when you were manic.
13697.0,Patient,What were some of the.
726.0,Provider,behaviors.
13697.0,Patient,"behaviors wow I was, I was super friendly amount of very much shy reserved person, and I was going up to people I didn't know, and I would just carry on a conversation, and it wasn't like I was anointed I think it was kind of I don't know it certainly wasn't me and talking really fast. And I thought, like I I got all the answers in my brain i'll sudden those are the those were the things that really. stood out. I felt like I knew what was wrong with the world and how I could fix it. And finally, when I got medication I realized no I don't think that's going to happen. It was, it was a fun ride one and half, but I mean same time it was I was out of control yeah."
726.0,Provider,"Well, it sounds like you're not feeling super depressed like it's like you may be right, I hide it doesn't feel like it doesn't sound like it was a sharp you know."
13697.0,Patient,Down i've seen certainly not haven't had any suicidal thoughts and i'm not you know reclusive or anything i'm i'm trying my best to you know i'm not saying that this has been a. negative situation it's just it's a temporary situation. So I think if I felt depressed that I would think that because I would think that was the spotted because there wasn't going to be. there's no options or. I don't know. How to put into words but i'm not depressed.
726.0,Provider,"yeah yeah. it's good maybe tracking doing like i'm. hoping to track how you feeling today to kind of have inventory of like where you start off in the day and how you end your day. it's far as moods and. Things like that, because I wonder if there's a pattern to this. kind of keeping track of a pattern or either you know if you're thinking about. Within the context of a month like what a month looks like for you and then what's the next one if if there is any pattern. That. We can kind of follow on or if it's just kind of all over the place, it could there might have been no pattern at all."
13697.0,Patient,"I don't there's a you know, like there's no highs and lows I could put down and I felt low today and. Tomorrow, I felt really happy I just feel I mean I feel even keeled and I don't think that could I don't think there's any drastic thing that I could document that would say oh yeah today, I felt like this yesterday, I felt like that I I just feel the same. yeah kind of boring, you know I mean I kind of feel boring. dull and boring."
726.0,Provider,yeah.
13697.0,Patient,"yeah but if I you know, I do have extreme feelings i'll talk in and try to see if, like you said if there's a pattern that you know, maybe it happens on Fridays only but. All my days are fried all my days of Saturday. i'm retired and that's you know, and I think that's still has something to do what triggered my whole manic episode is."
726.0,Provider,"All of a sudden, I didn't have."
13697.0,Patient,"Any character in the world, I I was retired, we were everything's going great for me and my wife and. Just was. That something to worry about."
726.0,Provider,I can't hear. I can't see you.
13697.0,Patient,"that's. A. Computer at all I know, but. Anyway, oh your video froze. Under you ever. Okay, can you see me, can you hear me."
726.0,Provider,"Yes, I can."
13697.0,Patient,Okay. i'm out in the middle of nowhere in Ohio. So that might be.
726.0,Provider,that's okay.
13697.0,Patient,Hope hands up. yeah i'm not sure what that's the same that happened twice now that i'm muted well.
726.0,Provider,"Okay, I had. I had this issue earlier with somebody else I don't know there's something in the air out there and. The connections are kind of spotty at time so don't worry I understand this, if you know you're traveling is not happening."
13697.0,Patient,yeah okay.
726.0,Provider,And so on so Richard when do you when did you officially retire.
13697.0,Patient,"I should know this by heart April April. wasn't even 59 yet I was 58. And my wife, she was able to retire about. Six months later, so, then all of a sudden, we had nothing, no, no worries we. Only thing we had going on before this all happened was just we were under a lot of pressure to sell our House. And I put a lot of. A lot of pressure on myself sell the House and I, which was unnecessary but. yeah I have nobody but myself to blame for that."
726.0,Provider,Would you say that that's when the mental health issue started. Now before.
13697.0,Patient,"It was no, it was after it was. I would say after I was, I was having a hard time sleeping, but I think it was just it wasn't like was when it finally really came to a head. I mean I wasn't in it at all and night. But I was just waking up early in the morning, like five in the morning, when I didn't need to get up. No, I don't think it happened until we were we were sitting in our trailer. And we were in middle of Arizona when, during a heat wave and there was nothing for us to do couldn't even get outside because it was so hot, and I think that's when it really came to a head. to know my. Nothing to do and we couldn't do anything if you wanted to, because it was so hot."
726.0,Provider,"Right. yeah. So Richard I don't know if you're interested, but I do um there's this therapy this whole in DR and it's it's based mostly. For trauma work but it's also very helpful for many other things as well as far as mental health and I didn't know if that would be something you'd be interested in doing on some because it's um. I found that sometimes it gives my clients a bit of insight as to why or what was going on that brought things have happened to happen um. So I didn't know I could send you information on it, and so that, for the next appointment, you know you can read through it tell me what you think about it and see if it's something that you'd be interested in doing um. I mean it's it's it's specifically made for people with trauma, but I find it helpful for people, even if you don't have big traumas maybe there were like event small events in your life that that may be affected, you were trigger something that happened. In some clients find it helpful to get insight on on themselves, or just get a better understanding of what was going on with them at the time, too. So. What i'm gonna do. yeah because we, I think I saw on your chart we we already have something scheduled on the 29th. right on so i'll i'll email you on that information. And you can I mean we think about it and see if it's something that you're. Wanting to try out and and if it's something that that you you're like i'm not that interested that's fine. You don't have to you're not obligated to do anything you don't want to so. Just alright."
13697.0,Patient,"i'll look it over. Okay, good, I had a one issue before our session today. I got a. survey AC."
726.0,Provider,yeah At first I am tired. Experiences survey.
13697.0,Patient,"Oh yeah. I don't know if you were it was your. department that sent it or if it was. But I filled out the answer the questions on the first section, and when I click on next it just started the whole thing over again and I tried it. So I never was able to finish, and I don't know if that was for your benefit or if it was for somebody else's benefit."
726.0,Provider,"wings I think they send that serving to everybody that's that's that comes into the program so no matter what program whether it's substance abuse, whether it's mental health or whether it's eating disorder week everybody gets that seems survey."
13697.0,Patient,"For some reason I kept on it would go back to like the first section would be your name and birthdate. And then about six questions I answered, and then I hit next and I got right back to first and let you know name and birthdate and the same questions over again, so I might I can try it again."
726.0,Provider,Actually i'm looking on your chart and it's all set. it's already put in that you completed that survey.
13697.0,Patient,So maybe that's why I did it that way. yeah.
726.0,Provider,yeah you're also with it.
13697.0,Patient,All right.

13697.0,Patient,"Right yeah. that's that's where I got messed up last time I was in Texas, and I guess wrong on on my the I thought that they had compensated for the time in my calendar. But they had. So if I was there two hours like instead of I thought I was right on time."
726.0,Provider,"it's okay. It happens to the best of us. I think everybody on the calendar for braveheart anytime they schedule, they their time zone is in California time so. um yeah and then you will have medical follow up on October 1. And that's at 615."
