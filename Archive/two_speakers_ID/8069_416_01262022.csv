8069.0,Patient,"yeah and I, and I still have like lingering symptoms too so like even though i'm no longer contagious and it's been two weeks, I still like can't exert myself physically at all, or I start getting like really bad headache and lightheadedness like it's really weird."
416.0,Provider,where you can I ask where you vaccinated.
8069.0,Patient,I was fully.
416.0,Provider,hmm.
8069.0,Patient,"I wonder if it's because I have celiac so technically, you know. hey I was weird I was at the park yesterday and I felt totally fine and then I just kind of I was walking my dog and then I kind of like ran him around a little bit and I just got so light headed, I felt like I was gonna fall over."
416.0,Provider,gosh. Well i'm glad you're slowly but surely getting a little better.
8069.0,Patient,"that's right yes i've just been like. resting a lot my sleep schedule has kind of. I mean it hasn't gone bad because I can go into sleep late i'm going to sleep at like. 1112, which is what I usually go to sleep at where I usually wake up at like. Like eight or so."
416.0,Provider,Now you're waking up at noon.
8069.0,Patient,Now i'm wake up at noon so i'm getting like 12 hours of sleep.
416.0,Provider,Your body's healing it needs it.
8069.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
416.0,Provider,So you've been down for like down and out for two to three weeks already.
8069.0,Patient,"yeah I would say that, as like really, really down and now for like a week. And then another week after that is like this weird in between kind of thing where it's like my body is feeling like it's Okay, and I can do some things, but not all. and"
416.0,Provider,You know i'm sorry.
8069.0,Patient,"it's okay that's that's how my mom felt as well, she had it as well."
416.0,Provider,Is that where you got her from.
8069.0,Patient,"Probably. And it's just kind of how her how she had it, as well as like like tricked her into thinking she got better, but it would just kind of like go and come back and go back."
416.0,Provider,"yeah yeah I mean your body's fighting against something it's never had to fight against before. yeah so it's your body's just still figuring it out so it's going to take a while. So. I mean, I imagine that you haven't really had time to like do the homework, we discussed or I mean."
8069.0,Patient,I mean I I did get the book. But i'm i'm far from like reading it productively. I haven't really. been reading. That much I haven't really had motivation to do much things lately. yeah so.
416.0,Provider,You get a pass.
8069.0,Patient,"But I did. And I am doing my actual homework like school, which is good."
416.0,Provider,You still have been able to keep up with that good.
8069.0,Patient,"yeah it's it's definitely really easy. I think I might have made things a little too easy for myself, but. I would rather make things too easy for myself and then gradually ramp it up, then vice versa."
416.0,Provider,"I think that's so wise. yeah okay. So you are. Tell me, which classes, again, are you taking right now."
8069.0,Patient,"i'm taking English class and a math class they're both like very. Like basic level. Just to like. help me get into the groove of even having classes, just so I can learn how to balance that with like work and life again. And also like just learn like not only like relearn the foundations, but also just get a refresher because I barely remember."
416.0,Provider,So and you're finding it to be really easy that's great.
8069.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
416.0,Provider,"Have you been have you been I mean because you can say, have you still been working or you."
8069.0,Patient,Know Definitely not. told my work once I felt like started feeling like a little off. And then I stayed home quarantine did the whole. The whole thing yeah.
416.0,Provider,good for you glad you kept yourself and everybody else safe.
8069.0,Patient,"yeah, of course."
416.0,Provider,"And so um. So you're thinking that maybe next semester, you might ramp it up a little bit."
8069.0,Patient,"I don't know if i'm going to ramp it up in the amount of classes that i'm going to take. But i'm I am going to ramp it up and like it's a difficulty of the classes, I because I remember what it was like to have three like difficult classes at once and that's way too much time it's way to latch. So I think two classes would be good."
416.0,Provider,"yeah perfect okay. So what am I know you're feeling kind of crappy what's important for you to talk about today, we want to work on."
8069.0,Patient,I did want to talk to you about these like recurring nightmare that I keep having. One of the reason i'm so tired right now is because it woke me up at like 4am. um. I would say that i've had this recurring nightmares since. Probably since like middle school. And it's like. Nothing like a bad happens in the dream it's an and it's really hard to explain this so bear with me.
416.0,Provider,Okay i'm listening.
8069.0,Patient,"it's like i'm in the dream and then i'm like sleeping in the dream. But I don't want to be sleeping so I just keep yelling until someone wakes me up. So, like. I would be I would be like. Let me come like the dream I had last night I was like walking around the House, and then I just fell asleep like on the ground, and I couldn't move. And I wanted my mom to come wake me up, so I literally just kept yelling over and over again, and then I kind of saw things from like her point of view and then she like came in woke me up, but then I actually woke up in like real life. And, and then, when I yell in the dream I yell in real life in my sleep as well, which is very it's very annoying like I used to I used to like wake up my family. For a while. And it's especially kind of like freaky cuz I just I just wake up from the dream and i'm like kind of disoriented for a few seconds because it's all like dark and i'm confused and i'm like oh wait, that was a dream and then I I sit there waiting to see if I need."
416.0,Provider,"To and you said this started happening, when you were young. And it sounds like tell me if you can describe in your own words sort of like what are the emotions that you feel in the stream."
8069.0,Patient,"If I had to describe the emotions and I feel i'm glad we're doing this now because it's very fresh in my mind. I would say it's just kind of like fear. it's just fearing I would say just. not really. it's it's mostly like not being in control I guess. Because i'm like. not getting control of my state of mind. And, and I remember like another variation of this dream that I would have. is like I would notice that i've been dreaming, you know how some people they like notice they're dreaming, so they turn into lucid dream and stuff and they're totally fine with it for for me growing up when I would notice that i'm in a dream I would immediately start. panicking and then like just yell until I would wake up."
416.0,Provider,"So um you. Okay, so you feel scared i'm hearing lots of like loss of control. And then i'm also hearing. I mean what it would it brings to mind immediately. For me, and I know this wasn't the case when it first started, but is some of the D realization."
8069.0,Patient,That you have right yeah.
416.0,Provider,it's just like probably a similar feeling for you right.
8069.0,Patient,It is yeah it's weird how that that it predates why like actual actually feeling this way.
416.0,Provider,Well it's not really that weird.
8069.0,Patient,"I mean, I know you've been telling me that, like it's always been underlying."
416.0,Provider,"yeah. But also, even if it weren't and you know that you've had the underlying fear of that sort of loss of control right. And that's what sort of fuels both things the nightmares and the. Deep realization."
8069.0,Patient,mm hmm. That makes sense.
416.0,Provider,"So it would be interesting to notice like when these nightmares come up for you, is it is it at times like is it after. hmm."
8069.0,Patient,"Interesting like 100%. This is a that is the number one factor and it's completely reproducible like i'm telling you right now like, if I if I go to sleep tonight, and I will leave the window open and the fan on and I won't put on like too many blankets, I will have a nightmare it's whenever my body is called."
416.0,Provider,That is a really interesting okay.
8069.0,Patient,yeah so and I have.
416.0,Provider,What do you think it is about the cool the triggers.
8069.0,Patient,idea I have no idea at all.
416.0,Provider,it's just the discomfort of being cold or something.
8069.0,Patient,"yeah i'm sure that if I Google, why do you have nightmares when cold don't be a bunch of studies by MIT or something about it i've never looked at."
416.0,Provider,me let. me see. The content of dreams may be largely influenced by the body sensations and what's going on in one's mind. it's just because you're uncomfortable. being called is it's not causing the nightmares and unless the nightmares are specifically about freezing being cold or temperature related in some way.
8069.0,Patient,"Because it's just very repeatable for me. Like I know that, like some people might be like. might be like oh you just would feel cold when you wake up because you're scared and i'm like I get that but it's like. it's very repeatable but regardless from from that of course that like I do feel like an increase of nightmares of not only this kind but, like other kinds when i'm more like stress than I thought. yeah going on."
416.0,Provider,"I would say, but your brains just processing stuff yeah."
8069.0,Patient,"yeah my factor is usually. The. it's called. The. what's the word for like the time between things frequency the frequency of the nightmares like I would say that I probably haven't had a nightmare in like. Over a year. Which is fantastic because I absolutely despise database. But there were like times, especially during like high school where I would be having nightmares almost every single day for like months on it. That was."
416.0,Provider,You described high school is being pretty brutal so.
8069.0,Patient,"And as you'd imagine like. wasn't. Helping with my sleep schedule having to wake up, like every single night and stuff yeah. So yeah it's mainly like the frequency of it and. I mean sure there's stuff going on right now, but like, but nothing compared to like. In the past."
416.0,Provider,"Well, but you've been sick and I wonder if that's connected. Right, I mean sickness, is in a lot of ways, like a feeling of loss of control over your body your health."
8069.0,Patient,yeah that's true.
416.0,Provider,Right.
8069.0,Patient,"And I haven't been able to like go out and or go to the gym and get exercise. And I am dealing with a lot of like life changes and stuff too, like my brother's going to college where. Are you we're moving to like just just to another house that's close by my family bought a house, for the first time ever."
416.0,Provider,Know congratulations.
8069.0,Patient,"Thank you, so the move is a little stressful."
416.0,Provider,As your mommy handling a move.
8069.0,Patient,"or not well because, of course. she's still like she doesn't really know how to ask for help, and she insists on doing everything herself."
416.0,Provider,And then gets angry with you when you're not helping.
8069.0,Patient,yeah and so it's a little stressful in that regard.
416.0,Provider,it's very stressful for her to I mean this is a move is like pretty much a nightmare for somebody with a CD.
8069.0,Patient,"It is it is. But we'll get through it it'll it'll suck for a little bit, but that it'll get better. yeah. and What else. And then yeah my whole girlfriend in college thing she is still here visiting she she'll be going back in like a week or two."
416.0,Provider,"Because, are they not in person, you."
8069.0,Patient,know they keep like. Like changing stuff. So yeah I definitely don't blame my son oh yeah and my brother is going to college and my best friend just moved to Vegas so it's like there's definitely stuff going on in my life but. I would say it's not affecting me as badly as it was during high school.
416.0,Provider,very sure i'm brother going to college.
8069.0,Patient,He is going to ucsb and say.
416.0,Provider,I know a lot of people who go there it's a great school.
8069.0,Patient,It is.
416.0,Provider,"yeah it's not super far from you guys, is it."
8069.0,Patient,Though which is nice because we get to see him like almost every weekend.
416.0,Provider,yeah it's like just far enough for him to be able to be at college right like be somewhere else but close enough that if he wants to come home every weekend he can do that yeah.
8069.0,Patient,yeah it's a really good like in between like that two hour drive from home. yeah nothing is like. The perfect distance.
416.0,Provider,And how about your sister How are things going with her.
8069.0,Patient,"usual. she's still like. trying to find out what's wrong with her and how to. deal with it. Like. I I believe she's now taking. Like she's now enrolled in this assessment program where it's like All they do is assess you and I think that was recommended to her somewhere. Where they were like well if you keep going to different doctors and they keep assessing you for different things you just need to go to an assessment place. yeah and my thought is how do you know that the assessment place will just assess you differently, but it looks like from what I can see their. process is more thorough."
416.0,Provider,"yeah, and I mean if that's all they do they're going to have a lot more tools at their disposal and diagnostic you know tools that other places, probably don't use. Also, usually if it's an assessment Center it will be a psychiatrist and or psychologist who are doing the assessments. And then the leave the the actual treatment to the therapists but it's usually kind of like a higher level and. degree doing the assessments themselves rather than like going to a therapy Center i'm making the sound like I don't know what i'm doing, but it is true, but like a psychologist is or a psychiatrist is more qualified to do like a comprehensive assessment than I am."
8069.0,Patient,yeah yeah and. I don't even think that they do treatment over.
416.0,Provider,"Right, so what they'll do is they'll diagnose and then make recommendations and then send her to someone like me to do the actual treatment. No."
8069.0,Patient,So she's doing that right now. So.
416.0,Provider,Good that's a good stuff.
8069.0,Patient,yeah hopefully it works out hopefully it's different. than the other. way what you said.
416.0,Provider,You said I know you're worried about her.
8069.0,Patient,yeah I. kind of. have to but. it's been okay lately. yeah.
416.0,Provider,Are you going back to sleep after this.
8069.0,Patient,Probably.
416.0,Provider,"you're still a little tired, I can tell."
8069.0,Patient,"Yes, especially because I. wanna hang out with my girlfriend later, so I don't want to be completely dead from waking up like so much earlier than i'm used to okay."
416.0,Provider,"Do you want to well, we only had a half an hour this morning anyway."
8069.0,Patient,So okay.
416.0,Provider,You want to. Get scheduled.
8069.0,Patient,"yeah let me, let me bring up my calendar."
416.0,Provider,All right.
8069.0,Patient,"i'm glad I was able to make it to like oh. I was, I was looking at the my alarm last night and i'm like oh God, I really hope I don't oversleep and miss it. So i'm glad."
416.0,Provider,"Well, the good news is, I have a much more flexible schedule in February, so if we wanted to look at two weeks from today that puts us at February 9."
8069.0,Patient,yeah.
416.0,Provider,"And I have 9am and then I also have. I have 1145 9am 9am OK, and then two weeks from. The 23rd. yeah and you want to do 9am then too."
8069.0,Patient,yeah let's do it.
416.0,Provider,"Okay, so the ninth and the 23rd."
8069.0,Patient,cool.
416.0,Provider,"So okay um. I think for this week or for this next little period of time, like just work on getting better, and if you can get in and do the homework that you didn't do before that would be great."
8069.0,Patient,yeah I want to and that's another thing and i'm like really struggling with like my motivation. Especially being home and stuff I find myself like slipping up on stuff that I usually wouldn't.
416.0,Provider,"Okay. I mean. Some of that's natural and people kind of come in and out of that, especially when you're sick. So give yourself a little grace. yeah and then you know as you start to feel better take it, step by step, you don't have to do it all at once, just little things. Like getting out and going to the park yesterday was Gray. you're still doing your homework."
8069.0,Patient,yeah. How do I force myself to. It it's like if that book wasn't so thick I feel like I would be able to just read the first couple pages a lot easier. something about it being like that it's overwhelming.
416.0,Provider,yeah okay well. Tell yourself to start with just one page you don't have to read you're not going to read the whole book. So watch your messaging to yourself right. Is there any one page could be from any book.
8069.0,Patient,I could do one page.
416.0,Provider,that's the message to yourself right there I can do one page.
8069.0,Patient,So you are literally the first chapter right.
416.0,Provider,yeah oh. i'm working but i'm wrapping it up i'll be right out.
8069.0,Patient,"I wouldn't be pages, is that chapter."
416.0,Provider,"First, half time. it's 32 pages, but you don't have to read the whole thing just read as many as you can."
8069.0,Patient,"Okay, I mean even then it's like if two weeks so like to look at."
416.0,Provider,"The pages, a day i'll get it there yeah."
8069.0,Patient,"yeah okay all right, I will get working on that."
416.0,Provider,"Okay, all right."
