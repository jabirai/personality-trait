408.0,Provider,Right and then. There is something to that mutual aid right the 12 step is designed as mutual aid. group of people walking the same path. And that is unique.
12263.0,Patient,"yeah you don't have to be a sponsored you know, two people along in and Program. I figured it out and then talk."
408.0,Provider,You can just.
12263.0,Patient,"When I went in and he can't read real well. And it was only a second week doing I went in and he had me I read everything that he needed to read, I was I pretty much I guess would be like the whole student forum. Because I read you know how what you know the prayer and you know the the welcome statement and and amy I did I read it off you can't read well, but it was a good time."
408.0,Provider,Good that's good to give you two are stronger together than Archer.

408.0,Provider,What did you think of the prayer.
12263.0,Patient,"It was all right, I liked it."
408.0,Provider,In a particular part of it.
12263.0,Patient,"give you one for later. i've never been a prayer type i've always you know resented any type of you know I know it isn't religious based on that. You know I know i've never been the type to pray you know, so it was it. it's got me thinking, but i'll be i'll be there i'll be there, Wednesday next week."
408.0,Provider,"Right, I was thinking of, apart from the actual prayer as an APP as an action to connect to a higher power, I was wondering more of the words themselves if there was any resonance or if any of the words echoed or board."
12263.0,Patient,"room. not really just. You know I always said it when I was young, my mom went through it, so we all my mom used to say, say that forever, you know what I mean."
408.0,Provider,"you're in a place now, though, where there is a lot. More to accept. In terms of the losses."
12263.0,Patient,Right and.
408.0,Provider,"Being being in limbo right. This holding pattern, so I wonder about that part of the serenity prayer where it says, you know the courage to accept to. Get that."
12263.0,Patient,"wisdom to know the difference oh. yeah i've owned by i'm like I said when I was a kid young kid my mom went in and day and she used to seeing it say it to us all the time, like when she would get pitched all over irritated or she would you know rear say it and I guess it would probably calm or down or whatever, but."
408.0,Provider,"Some are you personally finding ways to accept some of these things that are going on in your life, now that you can't change that you wish."
12263.0,Patient,"I cry every morning when I wake up. So I don't cry during the day that cry before I go to sleep at night. Just to get it out, I never cried. I lost it lots and lots and lots my whole life. I can't you know I find myself just breaking down during the day, so I don't cry and cry under today, you know I own my own business so it's hard to sit there doing crying in the corner, when you get work with them to make."
408.0,Provider,sure.
12263.0,Patient,"i'm just i'm in maintaining my kids call me twice a week I see him twice a week my daughter I go to her you're cheering. Just spending time with people that have shown. That they really are they're. Not to be fooling around because I was buying their drugs or selling drugs, you know the so called friends now I got true people that I know. don't want nothing out of me, but still check on me call me invite me out to dinner, do you know, to go heavy or. Go ice fishing or. Nice."
408.0,Provider,that's that's a real gift that's again.
12263.0,Patient,"You said, it is very much fun I enjoy it. um so enjoy this this whole aspect of radar like I missed my group one week you know I literally broke down because I. During our group I speak, right up and whenever I feel like I had something I want to say, or you know, be able to. Help some people and it's like I can I, you know, in the rooms of people are like fucking around she's my friends were there, or there for one reason and not there to actually be there. You know the whole their whole life. turned upside down the room may die they lost everything they had to get kicked out crying in the next week, no one even bring it up. You know don't make no sense to me. Right what it is what it is that's why i'm going to grab it and run with it."
408.0,Provider,"So part of what I hear you saying, Mr Greg is that in the past, when you are using that a lot of your relationships were what we call instrumental relationships, so they weren't actually intimate. They were there for. us to they were there for a instrumental reason, so you know you did things together, but it was not out of friendship, it was to to. A transaction."
12263.0,Patient,"yeah yeah I get my drama keep or sell their drug forum, or vice versa, whatever you know what I mean but."
408.0,Provider,"right because so. Of course that's kind of the nature of being in that user life is that it's all about getting the drugs, taking the drugs finding the next drug. yeah and the the time you spend on other people are is also oriented that way."
12263.0,Patient,"That makes sense, yes."
408.0,Provider,"And therefore, you only have the opportunity and the time."
12263.0,Patient,For relationships.
408.0,Provider,That are instrumental that are those kinds of like business transaction.
12263.0,Patient,"Nothing you don't care about you don't care about in relation and you know losing you know friends that aren't using that you know you might. not talk to a woman that holy should have been six months or a year you didn't even call your best friend and say it, because they did live the LIFE you live, you know what I mean."
408.0,Provider,"Well, because they the changes that the drugs. Make to your brain the person's. Brain orient. It makes. Your brain becomes tuned. To the substance as the main source of reward and the main goal that's part of the actual biochemistry change of the addiction."
12263.0,Patient,"yeah like I used to not sleep at night, because I do I have enough to get committed work in the morning, or can I have. A good day and. There wasn't even know weren't just me I had to support my you know my. My girl too, so it was always a constant battle is going to be seeing how I could make it through the day if I didn't have or if we if I would be able to get it through old today but enough to get there, I would lose sleep over it now i'm sleeping. Right, I can tell you have not slept a full night's sleep I don't even know how many years, and now I do enjoy."
408.0,Provider,"Well that's wonderful. And that helps your brain to be clear also. yeah the night's sleep is very, very important."
12263.0,Patient,"It is, I figured it out one more I especially my i'm getting older, you know what I mean and i'm not easy on my body. So, like, I feel I feel pain and I never felt before, because I was always high on drugs, and of course i'm not gonna feel if you put in technology or you're not going to feel pain, you know right."
408.0,Provider,"Right, well, I mean that's what Sentinel was actually developed for was the worst sort of cancer pain. that's what it's really for. me it was her people in the end stage of cancer. yeah the worst sort of pain and nothing else really addresses that's what it's really for and it's still you know it's still a. One of the few things that can help at that point for that disease."
12263.0,Patient,"yeah I just went through it, on my own with my girl."
408.0,Provider,"Right, I know that's why i'm talking about it."
12263.0,Patient,"She is we spend a lot of money, making sure she was comfortable."
408.0,Provider,You know what that's. You know about what i'm. Talking about.

408.0,Provider,Right.
12263.0,Patient,We take a day off now it doesn't hurt my feelings.
408.0,Provider,"So that's a less driven lifestyle, what do you think about that and more relaxed lifestyle."
12263.0,Patient,"You know i'm not used to it at all, but i'm getting used to it and I enjoy it. I enjoy like you know sunday's watching football not doing enough about eating food yeah. It."
