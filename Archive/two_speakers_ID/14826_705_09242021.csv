705.0,Provider,How are you.
14826.0,Patient,"Like not mostly the same as usual. Especially bad, but not great."
705.0,Provider,hi this. Is is this you say kinda as usual Is this how it is all week is kind of back back and forth or.
14826.0,Patient,"um it's not really back and forth it's just kind of like. Like when somebody asked me how I am going to to and i'm like fine usually means that i'm like. Not doing well, but it's like the usual amount of not doing well."
705.0,Provider,"Thank you, thank you for clarifying so it's not that it's up and down it's just like this is what. is going on."
14826.0,Patient,"yeah it's just like. But but anyway, but so."
705.0,Provider,What are some of the things Melissa that you've done like you know this week to manage.
14826.0,Patient,"and Then going on walks like a lot. Different gifts today, I went on a walk with twice and like throughout the week I get been taking like at least one a day. or. Like yeah i've been like going on walks are like. Trying to. do things that I really don't want to do that i'm supposed to do, like. Eating myself and drinking water. Trying to write things down. As today, I was feeling like kind of in crisis, so I like invited my like really good friend over and they stayed with me tonight. and"
705.0,Provider,"That right there, Melissa I am so glad to hear that you did not like in that moment, you were in crisis and you recognized it and you did perfect by reaching out and getting the support you need it."
14826.0,Patient,"In this really hard. Do it feels like those like even after i've done it it's like not really being like i'm so stressed about like how much i'm asking from someone else after, even if, like, I know that it was like what I should have done. My brain this looks like. So I gave that like I should have I should have been could have handled it myself."
705.0,Provider,"it's still that that judging piece that, even though this is exactly what we talked about as coping strategies until you learn maybe some of the other tools. Do you think them alyssa that from that kind of perspective that yes, so you would love to do these things on your own However, until you get there could could this be something that each day you're like look i'm, this is what i'm doing today, and this is my best."
14826.0,Patient,"um. yeah I don't I think when it comes to things like that it's really hard, because I like I I have like I don't know i've been going to therapy for like. Like a decade now, and i'm like I even I like wasn't going to therapy, I was reading like DDT books and like doing research and and all that and so i'm like I know what i'm supposed to do. But um I feel it feels like i'm doing it in a really like sterile clinical way and I don't actually feel any of it, like, I feel, nothing about any of those things and even when I see them to other people I don't really believe them."
705.0,Provider,"And someone's some ways, Melissa when you do have all the techniques like you're saying, and you have all that knowledge. That it's almost and sometimes more difficult because you're feeling like I already know this and, like I said you're filling isn't matching up it doesn't feel authentic it's just like i'm just going through the motions."
14826.0,Patient,"yeah and I. don't know I think like. I think like i've script like part of my therapy hasn't worked for me in the past is that i've like skirted by and like. On like sharing things that are like surface level vulnerable and not things that are actually hard for me to talk about. Like I can I can very plainly like. Concretely, like layout an explanation of something that's like really like clinical and like sterile and like see what it has caused and why it's caused that and like analyze it, but like. don't but I don't usually like say something that makes me like incredibly emotional and like have a realization."
705.0,Provider,"And I know that you, you probably have studied about what we use as Defense mechanisms and that this keeps people at a distance and this keeps you feeling safe."
14826.0,Patient,Right.
705.0,Provider,Do you connect with any of that.
14826.0,Patient,yeah I think like there's some amount of like this connection. Where like it's kind of like. Like when someone's doing like an analysis of like a book or like a character.
705.0,Provider,mm hmm.
14826.0,Patient,"When I talked about it, it feels like that feels like i'm just like this is fascinating research or something rather than like doing work on myself."
705.0,Provider,"yeah it's like a form of removing yourself where it's just like okay I can't let this in because of maybe things that have happened before, but. One of the things i'm hearing, too, is the trust and I think. For me yeah i'm hearing that you don't just come in and go hey this is me, and let me share my most you know deepest thoughts with you that it takes time to earn that trust and for you to get more comfortable yeah. yeah, and so I just want you to know, Melissa that this is not there are no expectations here I. go by what you want to talk about what you're willing to talk about and sometimes people will say you know what Valerie today I want to. You know 15 minute check in i'm good to go and other times, people are like you know what I want to step out and say something, but I don't want to explore it any more than that, and then I have the opposite where it's just like let's get to this."
14826.0,Patient,If.
705.0,Provider,"it's going to be up to you, Melissa."
14826.0,Patient,"yeah okay that's that's good that's really good to know. I. think like it makes me think about when I like first started going to therapy. Like 14. And my first therapists. I like had this problem, or maybe not maybe problem isn't the right word, but like I had this habit of being dislike selectively, or like. The kind of like part time nonverbal so basically like I would just I would just stop talking to anyone at all and stop saying things. And I. wrote my mom like a note. To tell her that, like there were a lot of things wrong like wrote it down on a piece of paper handed it to her and then walked away and like. I somehow she like found out that at my school they had like a therapist who would like pull you out of class to like see you for 30 minutes or something. So I started going to that. And I know this, that or I remember, now that a lot of the sessions, that I had with her were just like us sitting in silence. And I would be like this is a waste of time I don't want to be here it's so stupid like. nothing's being accomplished, I could just be in class right now i'm going to be behind everyone else like that being mentally ill, is going to. make me like being mentally ill and trying to get help for it it's going to make me even worse off because i'm going to be behind everyone else in school, and it is inevitably leading me to like. Like not doing well in school. and um. yeah I don't I don't remember I said all that, but. I. think that that that being like the start of how I experience therapy is like. So I don't know something maybe important."
705.0,Provider,"I think so i'm chillin I appreciate you sharing that with me, Melissa were again to like i'm saying you know it's up to you, and I feel like with that approach, but I also. hear that it's awkward if we just sit here in silence, I believe that there's therapeutic silence, but there's always also too awkward silence. And that is not. At that level, yet you and I just met. And I you know, like I said I don't think that. For me, and we all have a different approach, but I don't think by sitting here and waiting it out that that that would be therapeutic for for today. yeah yeah."
14826.0,Patient,"And also, I think I think i'm like. i'm 50 different now if there's like I have a lot to say it's just maybe like not always like. Maybe like a. Like a. template of like an act someone expressing expressing emotions. Know like i'm sad about this, and then I cry and then you're like it's Okay, and then i'm like thank you, it is okay like it's not I don't know I just was like. Sometimes it takes a lot of course like a lot more steps before I like actually feel any of what's being said."
705.0,Provider,"I agree, and if it doesn't feel authentic and it feels like you're forced like I don't I like to have a choice of what I do. And that's including when i've thought therapy is i'd like to have a choice. Of I move at my pace and and not to is really important is to move at your pace. I need sometimes the expectations that you're just going to come in and identify all these feelings so we're going to go from there, and put them in these different categories."
14826.0,Patient,you're like i'm gonna i'm gonna be like. I don't know why I am depressed and then you'll be like let's unpack that and i'm like well when I did. My dad died and you're like that's why the bridge.
705.0,Provider,"And it's like they're okay you're healed you can go on and on, on your day and it's like, no, no, no, no that's not how it works these things can help enlighten somewhat and we can take a look at childhood and connect it. But it's not as simple as like you are saying that's that's it's it is where sometimes people believe that it shouldn't be that way like okay. You just say that and it's like and I love that you use the word unpacked I try not to say that word, because in therapy, I was always like unpack do I have a suitcase. However, I will be very I will disclose towards the end, though I do visualize I utilize then they call it the luggage so maybe that's why i'm okay with it. But the luggage, for me, is when I go into my private life, I dropped off the luggage from my professional and vice versa, where I don't carry it throughout my way my my day like a form of letting go. So just thought when we're talking about suitcases that's what it reminds me of."
14826.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
705.0,Provider,Oh.
14826.0,Patient,"I think, also sometimes that terminology like. When it when it doesn't. Think. Wait it doesn't like. Again this like thing happens to me. You know i'm sure it's related to a lot of things, probably related to dislike my personality and whether or not a late to like a metaphor that someone else is giving. And like also probably relates to like having difficulties with like attention span where like sometimes someone will say something to me and, like the meaning and feelings of what they just said to me don't sink in it's just like there was like words coming at me. and Like. there's just no sort of like audio processing or there is but it's like the surface level times, where i'm like I understand the words that you said. And I think that happens to me when people use like therapeutic terms like that sometimes. Like. My like expert you're used to say, like i'm like i'm holding holding space for you. And I would get really bad like I would I would be like thank you and then but, like in my head i'd be like I don't know what. What the hell, that means like what are you saying what are you trying to say like if you're listening to me to say you're listening I don't know what what i'm holding space for you means like it's too vague. And I think that's yeah I don't know that's why I like said unpacking that like sit theoretical way because i'm like I don't I don't even know what that means to like someone else saying that to me."
705.0,Provider,Right right and coming up with your own terminology that's why you know I share that here's something to think about but do put your own words like when I talk about affirmations. The affirmations if you're using my words or somebody else's. it's probably not going to work as well.
14826.0,Patient,As you.
705.0,Provider,"see something to you, you know you're like."
14826.0,Patient,"yeah totally I like i've tried i've tried listening to those like affirmation. sleep videos where somebody just says, like you, are worthy you are loved you will attract money, just like over and over again for like three hours and i'm like none of this means anything to me and yeah that makes complete and total sense that. I would be my own specific like things to say."
705.0,Provider,Is there something that you do tell yourself on some days that it helps you manage that day it helps you just be like you know what neutralizing what's going on.
14826.0,Patient,"um yeah I mean it's different every time. But most of the time it's like. Most of the time it's like nothing like I literally like. Look, I like stare and just like clear my brain of like any thoughts and i'll just have those be like elevator music or something. Like I don't know if i'm like really in crisis and, like. I can't handle processing all this stuff by myself, I just like. go completely like nihilistic and i'm just like. little bit about the buck, but none of the air in front of me, is a real thing and i'll just like be really goofy for a while. And, but like you know it like it changes based off of like what it what it is, I think a lot of the time I start thinking about like the past. And how different it was and i'll be like I could have never predicted that I would have ended up here and so, if I couldn't have predicted it then, then that means I can't predict the next one, the next like phase or era, or whatever the next season on this show. Which means that. And everything is random, which means that but I can't predict the next era, or what i'm going to feel next. The probability that is is good, is just as much as the probability that it's good."
705.0,Provider,"yeah I took away that you call it out where it's just like we're not saying you know, sometimes people talk about positive psychology you probably have heard that where everything is is you know just put a positive spin. Might not work that way. Here it's coping skills, I think more in like coping strategies or coping techniques, whatever you know, like you were talking about the elevator music. It doesn't have to be then an affirmation, because that probably, in that event doesn't work for you, but the elevator music. In some situations. is working for you."
14826.0,Patient,"yeah and like I know it's not gonna always I don't know I think like sometimes when I do stuff like that i'm like is this healthy and I was having a conversation with a friend. who's like how so staying at for like a week and I was like this is like a friend i've known for one of my like old this as i'm like i've known them for the longest and. Like every time I have conversations with him it's always really I always feel like I learned something, and we were talking about like the word healthy like if it's a useless term or if it's a term that even means anything. And I was like well I think sometimes it is the best word to describe what you're trying to describe to someone else and they usually understand what you mean, but I think some other times it's like it's just impossible. Like what is what is like what is it what does it mean to be like healthy mentally and anyone be that. I don't think so. Technically it is healthy being perfect. I I don't think so. But. yeah I don't know I brought that up because I was like a lot of the time i'll be like it's not healthy to like distract myself all the time when I feel things and I was like what is healthy and like. Maybe if i'm doing it all the time now, it just means that those aren't things I can handle it now, and it will always be like that. And part of what like gets me into crisis mode is when I think that, like i'll be doing something forever."
705.0,Provider,such as the thinking healthy.
14826.0,Patient,"Like when I like. Like, for example, if I think that i'm gonna be doing, like the elevator music thing forever like oh i'll be like so before me and i'll be like. Does it matter and then i'll be like, but I don't really I don't think you want to do that, for the rest of my life. and yeah I know I think just generally about any sort of like regulation that I do currently if I think that i'm going to be doing it for the rest of my life it's like makes me really sad."
705.0,Provider,And with that too is even the term healthy is we each interpret that different of what that means. And you found something that for right now works for you.
14826.0,Patient,yeah.
705.0,Provider,"Could healthy even mean if you're in crisis and you're doing something to help relieve even a little bit. Is is that healthy. And so, your interpretation of what your needs are today, it can even change like maybe the elevator music or you know won't work for you in a different situation or maybe you change it up, it."
14826.0,Patient,"Like yes today. I. went for two walks and I walked like and I didn't walk very far one of the reasons i've been forcing myself to like go for walks like. When I was talking to my. Like. I had the psychiatrists who I was talking to it when I lived with my family in La and he, like. I had appointments with him and they like were like. Like I never. was able to have those appointments like they were just kind of like skipped and I found out after like a couple of them I was like i'm see Mexico just in a while I don't really know what's going on i've had no communication. And like it turned out that he had like died. and So, like a lot of things that we were like getting in to and talking about like didn't get explored much any further at all. Like. That like I was like this person died, and I was like I don't I don't know what like which do, or what to feel about this but, but like so when I talked about like things that I talked about with him i'm like yeah I don't. I don't I don't like really know how to like. Talk about them, or like. If are like I guess like they they weren't really like explored very much, but like. Maybe I don't know what he's I don't know what he was thinking and I can't like. talk to him, so I can't figure it out, but like they were like a lot of like. Things that he asked me about it basically what i'm trying to say is like there were a lot of things that he asked me and told me about that they don't really understand now because they don't have any more context for them. And one of the things that he talked to me about is like, if I had some form of like a cool phobia. and Yesterday, and I was going for a walk I noticed that I am. scared a lot of the time. and i'm like scared i'm like scared and like catastrophizing about things that are perhaps very low probability. Every time I come into my house and I go into my room I lock the door and I don't feel comfortable until the doors closed and locked. If my doors open and i'm in my room I don't feel comfortable if i'm in my living room I don't feel comfortable if I am standing on my porch I don't feel comfortable if I walk outside of my gate. things start getting more like creatives like i'll be like i'll walk out of the gate. walk down the street all Catholics some sort of service vehicle or something and i'll be like they're going to spray gas that's going to kill me, I have to hold my breath when I passed by this vehicle. Like something something bad is going to happen if I don't hold my breath when I pass by this vehicle. And like if someone like talks to me i'm like this is bad, this is really bad I don't even have any like. Reason i'm just like this is bad somebody sucking to me it's just bad I gotta get home as soon as possible, and in my room with the door locked and like even when i'm in my room with the door locked if I like have to crack my window open to like let Aaron i'm like. there's no bars on my window like that's not see if I had to get out of my window like i'm too high up I can't jump from this window i'm not strong enough to open it. yada yada yada like blah blah blah i'm just like I just create, like several reasons to be scared to be a human every day. And I like."
705.0,Provider,Is that turn into phobia how much isn't is that what i'm hearing two part of your question.
14826.0,Patient,"i'm. Like. I think like I try my hardest to mask when there are other people around so that I don't seem like i'm crazy. So, if someone says, do you want to go take the train with me to San Francisco. I will be like. No i'm really tired today like it sounds it looks very normal to other people I would imagine. um but, like in my brain i'm like i'm going to die if I get on that train. i'm like going to die by step outside or like if i'm like asleep and there's like a little bit of like some sort of like shaking because, like a. Like big car like band passes by the street i'm like this is it, this is an earthquake and I need to get up and figure out what to do and i'm going to die or like. Sometimes i'll hear something in my house and I like think about how easy it would be again under get under my bed, and they could leave us a space under there for myself to like get in. or like oh like Sir this really feeling the fear that I would feel if someone started breaking down a locked door. hey. yeah that's that's a lot of roundabout ways of saying that i've been forcing myself to go for walks every day that's really terrified."
705.0,Provider,"start. that's a start to challenge, some of the things that's going on internally."
14826.0,Patient,"it's like like logically about it i'm like that's so silly like. Oh. Like what i'm saying I was passing by the. The like truck and the truck was like running and I had to hold my breath what my past by the truck because I was like. This I was I don't something about the way that it looked like this person is going to try to hurt me in a really discreet way. And I was like just thinking like I needed to hold my breath because they were going to like spray something like toxic at me. On purpose and I wouldn't be able to tell until I was like suffocating, and then I was like i'm going to be the one who like hold my breath and doesn't fall for it. Like as I was passing by like held my breath for as long as I could. And I was like. I I fooled them and then I like walks, on the other side of the street on the way back to my out, so I was like I don't want to walk by that again and have them know that I survived. I get so silly logically but. that's that's somehow what my brain did."
705.0,Provider,"and Melissa when I hear it, I don't think silly what I think and knowing with anxiety is it feels real at that time, and so, if, at the time it feels real. That eliminates the silliness you were trying at that time, just to be like okay like you said you were going to hold your breath, because at the time that was what you knew to get you through that situation yeah. And also."
14826.0,Patient,"Like to to like get back to what I was saying earlier about how I was like and someone asked me how I am actually fine because, if someone asked me how I am, and I say. i'm actually like doing really bad right now and then they say why I have to explain this shit that makes me sound like fucking crazy like. I can't like I i'm not able to just be like my dog died, like, I have to be like I think every car outside is out to get me and like I like can't go outside but, like, I have to go outside or have to figure out how to go outside so that I can like literally like. make money to survive. and live and have a house and yet I like can't do it, and so i'm like I don't know how long, I will be able to live and survive and have a House when I like can't figure out how to do this thing. without it being like horrifying to me every single day and I don't know what that's causing like what long term. I don't know what like forcing myself to go outside. And experiencing like an a large amount of fear, every day, constantly is like doing to my body, but it feels like it is doing something like physical, that is not good."
705.0,Provider,"And not sure what ifs and and the the what IFS are usually it's about a lot of worry, a lot of catastrophizing the worst case scenario. And I know, Melissa probably a lot of things, maybe you've tried in the past where sometimes but you know. taking it to the worst case scenario, so an earthquake happens what What would you do in the event and again, some of these techniques will work on some of the events that you're having going on, and some of them will not. But it is calming for you to go there and be like in the event that something did happen. I would manage I might not know how. But I would manage. Yes, just like you were saying you've adapted to when a person asked you how it's going and instead of saying fine or something like that. That you've adapted to have what you're going to be saying, maybe not how you feel about that, and even in time, I mean those things change to have what you're willing to you know, open up. So people, because not everybody is going to understand right if we talk about some of our irrational beliefs not everyone's going to have that capacity they're thinking, something you know they think things different they feel things different. To say you do and others."
14826.0,Patient,"feel. I like um since i've moved in here i've been like pretty good friends with my housemate. And there was one time, where we were talking. And she told me that I was like a mystery to her or something like that. And I was like What do you mean just like like I just feel like there are a lot of things I don't know I don't really know what's going on all the time. I guess I didn't like realized that I was like a secret of person. I thought I was just like sharing the. Like the. One okay one thing one one of the reasons why I think i'm like on the autism spectrum is because I have an intense rigid like. Like strict fixation on like rules. And sometimes the rules are like completely fake and like no one else has them. And so i'll be like I, I think the rule for normal human interaction is that you shared this much and i'll be like this is the rule, this is how much you say to people, this is what you say to people when they say how are you. Because i've heard it from someone else and I copied it, this is how you respond to someone when they like walk into the room that you're in because i've seen other people do it i've watched other people do it, and I know that this is how you respond to it. And so, like when someone talks to me about how i'm feeling and it's like casual conversation like rule that I created was that it's just polite to ask. So I don't I don't actually answer for like I slightly actually answer like i'll be like not great, but it's fine or something or i'll be like i'm fine like that's like i'm fine it's like. Answering politely not great, but it's fine or like not great, but i'm holding on or something like that it's like. letting them know that like i'm not doing that grateful we don't have to talk about it. And I thought that was like the rule like I didn't I don't really know how much you're supposed to share with other people and. I I have like good boundaries or I have bad boundaries, the opposite way that most people think of them, like most people think of like. guide boundaries it's like you overstep and, like you, over share, but like i've got boundaries in the waiver like I don't know what to share so I don't share anything."
705.0,Provider,"yeah and what that Melissa and i'm glad that you're bringing this you know out because. you're right if you're thinking different and you're doing these things to kind of put it out there satisfy what you feel like as it is like giving yourself that permission that you know what. it's okay that you don't answer the question you don't have to if you don't want to. If you're if you're feeling like you would like to give more because the level of trust after you meet someone and build some rapport then Okay, but being able to just say you know what i'm not going to put that pressure on myself. And Sunday, so I mean, I will just share with you some days I feel like sharing more and maybe more get into it and other times. it's just not that kind of day and that's okay to realize that yeah."
14826.0,Patient,yeah make sense.
705.0,Provider,"roles to. there's within rules in our guidelines we set for ourselves, especially right. And you use the word rigid and and with that you know it can be helpful if we set our rules, because then we don't have any question about it, we just do it, and that makes us feel comfortable. So that's the part where I feel like with some of the rules, it can be a. Pro you know of okay this this helps but that other part of it is, then, when you break the rule, then you feel like oh Why did I break this rule."
14826.0,Patient,yeah.
705.0,Provider,"And having some flexibility, and so we talked about the word even unhealthy and sometimes I use the word balance like what do you think about the word balance."
14826.0,Patient,um yeah I think that's. Probably a more accurate word to describe like. Things that we are the complexity and like non black and white area of things that we're talking about.
705.0,Provider,"And from the outside, if you didn't know me what i'm looking at is my balance, I know you know my balance someone else might not understand that."
14826.0,Patient,yeah.
705.0,Provider,"And that's part of it, too, can be. stressful and trying to figure it out and how do we keep that balance, how do we. strike a balance. But part of it is also exciting when you take back the empowerment of you get to choose what you want to do as far as being in balance or not. In your years of therapy has anyone mentioned like you know OCD like obsessive compulsive with some of the rituals."
14826.0,Patient,"um. I. have never had a therapist mention it, but I have had trends mentioned it."
705.0,Provider,"Pal. it's one of those things that if that's something we'll have said down the road that you want to look at a little bit more and do an assessment, I can see with the prescriber because. You were asking like about agoraphobia or other phobias, or maybe you know, is it a little bit of OCD I mean there could be different things that are coming to play."
14826.0,Patient,"yeah I yeah i've never had any sort of likes I think my my therapy is always has pretty much always been specifically like depression related. i've never had therapy related to any. Anything else that could be like. impacting how anything any like other thing that could be impacting how depressed them, but I have like. You know I like at the very, very beginning of my therapy, I did have like that first therapist say like Have you ever thought about it's like. Some, like your depression is. worsened by your anxiety or fear depression is worsened by something else going on. So, like it would make a lot of sense if, like it hasn't been successful because i'm not like targeting the right things are like targeting multiple things at once."
705.0,Provider,"And it's hard to know too, because a lot of the disorders may mimic a different one and it really is like you were saying with the depression is what piece belongs, you know, or maybe more geared towards depression. Whereas the other more anxiety, especially if it comes to sometimes you know people create like a ritual, as I have to lock the door so many times, and this is what I do at night, in order for me to go to sleep."
14826.0,Patient,"And it's so it's so funny that you say that because the friend who I like invited over yesterday, when I was in crisis. Was I was talking to them about how I when I get in a car it's really stressful for me because. I start like in voluntarily playing this game or there's like a laser coming straight out of my head and I have to like lift the laser over every house and every car or something like bad will happen to those people and they were like. Look, they were like yeah dude you got OCD. And this is something that i've done since I was a very young child like it just like is Simon it's like satisfying and distressing at the same time, and I like when I sit in the passenger seat of a car all like be doing this. Because i'm like lifting like being from my head over all of these like people."
705.0,Provider,"it's allowed you to get in the car it's allowed you to function in that way, where, again, is taking a look at. Is it something that out of necessity to get in the car that you create it or is it where the patterns are a little bit more, because sometimes two people will say. I have some characteristics of it, but not all the way that it's not not diagnosable and that's that's good too, because you just learn about okay if i'm more prone towards this, let me look at that some more, and is it going to be helpful, maybe."
14826.0,Patient,"yeah yeah I guess i've never really thought of it that way in terms of like. It being something that, like my like child brain like some like. Little small distracting video game that I like child brain created to be able to go outside and get in the car really like frame it that way."
705.0,Provider,"How, though, especially at that age how smart is that to already internally figure out something of how you could navigate through the world and in that driving situation."
14826.0,Patient,"yeah yeah I don't even know how or when that happens, or like. All I could have thought about how we could have thought of that like if I use like the big that they have now they used to reason through things to try and like figure out that solution, I wouldn't be."
705.0,Provider,"Some are coping strategies to is, if you know somebody say look, you know what Melissa if the laser is working for you, if that is self soothing when you get in the car and allows you to drive in the car ride in the car. Then, then okay if it gets where it's problematic and it's causing you more stress and you reevaluate it and you say okay well, maybe this is something I want to maybe adjust. Then that's also a different way to just take a look at it like. Well, you know what, if this is where I am right now and I need to do that. Okay."
14826.0,Patient,"Okay yeah it's like it is, it is distressing and stressful to have to do, but also perhaps better than perhaps it is like harm reduction from the. Experience of just being present and afar."
705.0,Provider,"Right rate and what's acceptable for one person may not be acceptable for somebody else and it's like i've had people were you know they'll say that they always carry a water bottle. Because they're still doing that distraction like you're doing a form of distraction, with the laser they do a distraction, with the water bottle. or I have someone you know else that maybe does different tapping on their face because that works for them it's the same thing, but in a different way."
14826.0,Patient,yeah.
705.0,Provider,"Having that ability to adapt by you know you talked about earlier is like tying it to you know, some people like to go down to childhood and think about that, and why we adapted did these things but it's like the key to me, is today. That still at ability to adapt when you need to adapt the willingness to to make the changes that you want. To pay you want, and at the pace that you want."
14826.0,Patient,Okay. yeah.
705.0,Provider,friend to that you had once you talked about the laser did you find it to just like after you said it. Did you get the just like you know what I said it now it's out.
14826.0,Patient,"um. um. yeah it felt like. It felt like it was like. I think I have a lot of like imposter syndrome about like whether or not they have it like as bad as other people, or whether or not the things that I experienced or big deal or like worth talking about at all to anybody, and so what they they they have like they have like like. Like like OCD. Clinical like if mentioned with like OCD and if I talked about it to therapists. psychologists it's been like a big thing in their life that they'd like really worked really hard to like improve in and i've i've seen them improvement like i've seen them like. get better and more comfortable in their life like this thing so like when I talk to them about something that I experienced that I didn't think I would I even like. I didn't think was even worth mentioning to anybody and they're like yeah dude you're able to be I get this felt like. Like. I think this whole time I thought I was like overreacting or something like that. So it was felt yeah so like a confirmation, but not necessarily in a bad way."
705.0,Provider,Right.
14826.0,Patient,"Like oh other people other people who like seek treatment for this thing feel, similarly to how to."
705.0,Provider,"And the whole because he you've been able to witness your friend getting some of the healing done to and making adjustments. And so you know it brings it back where it's just like okay well. i've witnessed this i've seen the changes and. Also to I can choose to do that it. I think that. To have a friend that you felt you could share and you did. Is is great it's sometimes people don't have one person in their life that they feel like they can just. Be yourself. Had sometimes I don't know when when all this it's almost like a take a deep breath and just like. You know, it can get sometimes. In session, just like okay i've let it all out and it's just like. Well i'm glad that. That you signed in today and I was able to see you, and you know talk about some of these things that have come up. I did want to check into Melissa I always check in with, especially when it comes to suicide, because I know that that can happen at times like today, have you had any thoughts."
14826.0,Patient,"um, no, no."
705.0,Provider,"Okay, if there's a time that you do please let me know and we'll you know I will support you through that I know, sometimes there's been a fear that a person will say you know I follow you justin going to. Call and maybe the police and things like that I want to share with you, Melissa that you and I, working together, and we have that safety plan that we did as talking about that safety plan and just like you were the other day in crisis. You did what you needed to do to keep yourself safe. And that's where you know I work with people on different levels, sometimes if people do need to have the support, then we work on that too. I will reach out to. Your prescribers to just see if there's if they do any testing for assessing for OCD. Is that okay. And then they'll reach out to you, and then I think to amanda was reaching out to you for the eating disorder to do an assessment."
14826.0,Patient,She called me today and I said at the spin appointment.
705.0,Provider,"awesome. And again it's just trying something else to see because that's probably another factor of what's going on. yeah. So, in your words today if you had one takeaway, what do you want to take away today."
14826.0,Patient,"um. Things. Like. I spent a lot of time trying to figure out how to disconnect myself from situations that feel. Like distressing. and Something that I have to do in order to in order to get better it's like. Experience like actually experience like. or be present for like things that i'm saying about myself or thinks of other people say to me. and My my habit is so like disassociate or like focus on likes like some sort of like psycho psychosis. And I am talking very clinically about. Something that has happened to me, maybe that is a moment where I need to like try and practice being more present and actually in my ability to feel it. And that. I don't have to beat myself up for like creating the seal to not feel."
705.0,Provider,"That word shield. I am, like, I want to highlight that because that's your word have to me a shield is your protection and when you need it, you have it, and when you don't. And if visualization works for you, you can sometimes and distressing times put up the shield."
14826.0,Patient,yeah.
705.0,Provider,"I appreciate how open and honest and then I got a chance to know even a little bit more Melissa of. You know how how things are like what you were saying about the unpacking is I get that and that was the the humorous part and that we can laugh and have humor and you're also, though. able to shift gears and we talked about some things that were a little bit more to you know and that's how that's how I want to make sure that. In this space that you're comfortable, so please if ever there's something that is either said or a way, you know that i've turned something just let me, let me know and let's let's talk about it, or you can choose not to talk about it and just put it out there."
14826.0,Patient,yeah. makes all the sense.
705.0,Provider,Good. If you like to it looks like Melissa I don't think after today have you set up any individual for you and item meet again.
14826.0,Patient,"No, this is the only one that I have scheduled."
705.0,Provider,Would you like to schedule another one.
14826.0,Patient,"Yes, okay good."
705.0,Provider,"let's see today so Friday is Fridays, the best day for you, or is there, another day of the week."

14826.0,Patient,"Yes, 30 for me."

And I can go ahead and schedule that and. And i'm just bringing up the calendar takes it a minute. i'm bringing up the first and we said I was going to be a one him not am. Always."
14826.0,Patient,Make sure I didn't put it in. yeah.
705.0,Provider,"Great so that saved in and so let's meet again next week and then you know I i'm happy to hear with amanda that you're able to connect. By next week i'll have at least some update on what I found out through the prescriber if that's something we do, or if we need to do an outside provider. So i'll check with that. sounds good to me to what's going to be on the agenda for the rest of the day."
14826.0,Patient,"um well the friend who I had silver. was still here when I started in the waiting room. And went to a book, I really cool bookstore with my housemate and they said that they would look out to see if there were any books that I might like and that they were going to get. There right next to a boba store so they're going to get uber can get me something and they'll probably come back and i'll hang out with them until they have to go to work."

14826.0,Patient,Thank you so much.
705.0,Provider,"Thank you, Melissa. Patient and saying that today she's not suicidal no plan no intent so still the low to moderate risk for patient she has her safety plan I, the other day she did have a crisis, she implemented. The plan by seeking a support person that she called over and had them spend the night so patient is doing well with that and so right now it's still the low to moderate on the suicide risk assessment."
