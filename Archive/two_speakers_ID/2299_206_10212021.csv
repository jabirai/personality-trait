206.0,Provider,"yeah I saw her yesterday, and she added a new prescription new medication. Okay, on which is an antidepressant. Because the, the one that I was on abilify it's not really antidepressants for like irritability. But previously I don't know I I didn't really enjoy being on it and I depressants in the past. But it's kind of at this point, I think I was probably necessary."

2299.0,Patient,"Okay, all right."
206.0,Provider,"I want. To try pick it up, but yeah didn't work out."
2299.0,Patient,So I have things changed at all since last week in terms of kind of your ruminating over what am I life choices and that sort of thing or have you been able to do a little.
206.0,Provider,"I mean yeah i'm still kind of. In that space. In the Funk yeah and i'm like sleeping a lot I don't know if it's like. I mean, I want to blame it on like the winter coming like the change of seasons that i'm sleeping more."
2299.0,Patient,I mean could be part of it.
206.0,Provider,"yeah but i've been sleeping more like for a while. I mean, I guess, like the days have been gradually getting shorter so."
2299.0,Patient,"Like when you say sleepy more what are, what are we talking about like how much."
206.0,Provider,"i'm. Like. I don't know 1011 hours. Like just going to bed super early after work at nine in the morning and I keep thinking like oh i'm going to go to bed like super early and then i'll just like wake up early and then i'll like do a bunch of stuff in the morning. Like all like stretching do yoga and then i'll like do a little bit of my homework because i'll have like a couple hours you know, like if I was sleeping like eight hours, like normal person. But then my alarm goes off and i'm just like yeah no no way."
2299.0,Patient,Have you been to a primary care Doc anytime recently.
206.0,Provider,"i'm not super recently. I mean, I had like a phone conversation about like some stomach problems, I was having."
2299.0,Patient,yeah like blood work or anything done you.
206.0,Provider,"Go yeah no I didn't I, the last time I had blood work was probably like a year ago."
2299.0,Patient,Maybe a little you have any history of like a name er or anything like that.
206.0,Provider,"No, not really. Okay, is this ever happened to you before us like select a lot. No, not it's very it's pretty unusual because I usually like stay up late, I usually have a problem, going to sleep like I usually be up to like midnight i'm kind of a night owl. And then I would basically. end up missing sleep, but still be functional. But yeah I used to stay up really late. And now it's like. Like eight o'clock rolls around and i'm like well it's almost time for bed."
2299.0,Patient,yeah.
206.0,Provider,"Like nine o'clock Okay, this is yes, good on your what else, am I going to do. Like I just feel so depleted of energy that I don't know what else I would do like with my time. By nine o'clock besides, just like lay on the couch and watch TV."
2299.0,Patient,"You know, it may very well be worth getting into see your primary care Doc also and just ruling out a physical cause for any of this. I mean i'm hopeful that the wellbutrin will sort of. kick kick into gear and help you get some relief, but."
206.0,Provider,it's just depression honestly. You don't get the feeling that it's like. some kind of physical thing is out of whack.
2299.0,Patient,"So tell me about your thoughts, a little bit. How have they been going in terms of like I know that the thoughts come in, but are you able to pause them and provide counter statements to them at all, or are they just taken over."
206.0,Provider,"They come to take over. yeah. I had a really rough week at work. I almost want to quit my job. I really thought about it, like all day to day I was like I think I think i'm really might need to quit this job I think this might be too much for me."
2299.0,Patient,Oh no what's going on.
206.0,Provider,"So the babies with I don't really know what's wrong with her, but she was just like super fussy and like maybe like super bad separation anxiety, like her, just she just having like full on like meltdowns like a two year old and she just turned one. And she just a lot of crying and craftiness and i'm stuck in their apartment so it's like. it's hard to get away from the parents they're like coming and going in and out of their room they both work from home so every time she sees them she wants them and then she cries all over again so like. Like it's I can't walk her past her like the office door because she'll like hear her mom like basically we have to like stay in this like enclosed a. play area it's not very big otherwise she'll get too close to her mom and then hear her mom talking and then have another meltdown. And like spinning that many hours in like a playpen it yeah with a baby with like a crabby ass baby i'm like this is too much for me."
2299.0,Patient,yeah. sound like fun you why can't you go anywhere.
206.0,Provider,"Oh, they won't let me. yeah just wanna. They won't Let me take her out to the park or for a stroll or anything. yeah so it was bad a."
2299.0,Patient,neighbor a reason for that.
206.0,Provider,"I think they're just paranoid about coven. Being like away from her because they've been with her like since she was born because they're both work, working from home, and I think I think the mom has separation anxiety."
2299.0,Patient,It sounds like it yeah. This is our first.
206.0,Provider,"mm hmm yeah and, like the mom definitely has. Like maybe OCD she told me she did she's like like I self diagnose like i'm like i've never been diagnosed with it, but like i'm pretty sure I do i'm like yeah i'm pretty sure."
2299.0,Patient,she's given it to her daughter to.
206.0,Provider,"yeah. It sucks because I kind of feel like it's super unhealthy for like a kid to be cooped up like. In such a small apartment you know there's no yard, or anything like this kittens to get outside and like breathe some fresh air and we see some new things like. i'm sure she's hellebore. And it like under stimulated."
2299.0,Patient,"I mean yeah, what do you even do with a one year old to that, I mean."
206.0,Provider,For six hours yeah it's it's up.
2299.0,Patient,"i'd be fussy too yeah. yeah what yeah one year olds you want them out and about and stimulated and stuff staying inside is hell with them at that age. smell like you're playing a game or interacting right, I mean how long can you like. They don't they they're not even capable of interactive play at that age parallel play if anything right."
206.0,Provider,"yeah yeah no she has like a pretty short attention span, I mean she's one. Like you said yeah like. I mean like taking one year olds on strolls is like perfect for them, because then they can just like look around and the scenery is like change. And you talk to them and tell them about. Then they can like get out and run around on the grass and. I don't know stuff like that."
2299.0,Patient,So that's a hard rule of thirds you can't revisit that.
206.0,Provider,Oh.
2299.0,Patient,alright.
206.0,Provider,So yeah sorry about that I just got a phone call and it like.
2299.0,Patient,"interrupted the zoo I hate that that happens on my end too, and I was saying that is so that's a hard rule you can't revisit it they're not budging."
206.0,Provider,"No, no, I brought it up like pretty early on to and and she was like well i've never been away from her I don't think I can handle it and. And I was like well how about you want to go for the walk with us. We cannot go together you. Go yeah like I should get out of the House like I should go. I should go walking i'm like yeah you probably should like she doesn't leave the House at all the mom. Or the kid like they don't leave."
2299.0,Patient,"Like every time this might not be the best fit for you, I mean I can hear why."
206.0,Provider,"I mean it was already like bad enough, and then and then now not being able to take the kid out to let her walk around the House like being stuck in the playpen like it's just like another level. Of like hell. I mean, especially like with my mental health like yeah. I don't know like if it's like affecting I don't know."
2299.0,Patient,"Why, it seems like it is affecting yeah it sounds like it's affecting her too, but it does seem like it's affecting yeah."
206.0,Provider,"yeah. yeah I don't know if it's like my mental health is shitty right now so i'm just like looking at it through a super negative lens or if, if this is actually like making me like more depressed because it's like so strenuous."
2299.0,Patient,"Well it's strenuous and it's also it's confining there's like that feeling of. What is yeah I mean. I don't know about the rest of the world, but I would have a really hard time with that, too, that sounds like hell to me. yeah that would impact my mental health and my I mean I would imagine it would be hard to go to work every day, knowing that that's your day."
206.0,Provider,"yeah so I mean I really seriously it this this just happened this week with the separation anxiety and the fits and stuff. And i'm just like okay so. Is this really like. Like I don't know i'm just like well what else, am I gonna do like I guess I could like drive like do lift again I was doing that, before coven uh huh. Or look for like another child care gig. But this is like the third one i've gotten where. The parents are weird and i'm stuck at home with the kids and the parents and the kids usually cool. But the parents usually have some weird quirk."
2299.0,Patient,uh huh.
206.0,Provider,"yeah, this is the third nanny gig that i've had during the pandemic. And i'm like. Thinking maybe it should be the last."
2299.0,Patient,"uh huh maybe i'll. Either like when you think about. a job that might be kind of fun for you can you think of anything that me does anything come to mind when you're like Oh, it would be fun to spend my day doing this job."
206.0,Provider,i'm. not really like. I can't really think.
2299.0,Patient,"You are out here, but. I feel fairly. Okay sorry so not really have you had a job in the path that you've been like pretty cool."
206.0,Provider,"um. yeah I mean when I was working for myself, I had like periods, where I was like this is inspiring and I could make my own schedule and kind of just do what I wanted to. yeah i'm not like really qualified for a lot of jobs, so."
2299.0,Patient,What were you doing when you're working for yourself.

2299.0,Patient,yeah okay so um.
206.0,Provider,"Okay, I don't have a great resume because, like most of the time i'm not even going to like put that on there."
2299.0,Patient,"You don't have a bad resume though either. I mean there is such a Labor shortage, right now, people are really looking hard for people, I mean, and I think they look more for like the quality of the person. Often than their technical skills or experience right they want to know that you are. You know that you're reliable and that you're nice to be around and but I don't think you have to have a ton of experience, right now, because people are really, really hoping to get good people and that they can count on to go in too high to be hired to work, the."
206.0,Provider,"yeah I mean, I can see what I could see what's out there and like look on craigslist."
2299.0,Patient,yeah.
206.0,Provider,I don't know.
2299.0,Patient,"yeah I mean, of course, you know you it's your decision just um. It just sounds like you're pretty unhappy there and it is hard to know if it's the depression, but I mean, I can tell you from an outside perspective that would feel really yucky to me that situation."
206.0,Provider,miserable okay.
2299.0,Patient,"yeah I mean, even with my own child when he was around that age, I would be out for hours every day because I could not stand being home all the time just just like what do you even do and I didn't want to turn the TV on right to like. The kid that age your there's only so much one way discussion, you can add you know. hmm and it's easier to have one way discussion when you're out about our how many books, can you read really right how many songs can you do."
206.0,Provider,yeah. that's to do and then just do it all again.
2299.0,Patient,yeah. I used to have every single one of my son's books memorized because we just read them so freaking much. I could just recite them.
206.0,Provider,I mean yeah I can't imagine being cooped up like with my own kids like we were always out. I always take them on outings. The different parts and stuff.
2299.0,Patient,yeah constantly hikes whatever. Just take with you and go do something.
206.0,Provider,Totally. yeah even just to go run errands and stuff.
2299.0,Patient,"Absolutely so much better, I remember, I was telling somebody the other day about the. The aim target trips I don't know if you ever did this, but when I was on maternity leave, so he wasn't quite one, but when I was on maternity leave. And even on the weekend after I was done with maternity leave, you know they wake up so early and i'd have to wake up to it, it was hilarious because I don't know I just needed something to do right. I didn't know what else to do with them so. I would just get them up and i'd get up and we'd go to target that was what we do and there's a starbucks there. And it was hilarious because he would I would see like it was me and every other mom have like a really, really young kid we were all like zombie like you'd walk in and with like going straight to starbucks getting. Coffee and then like wandering aimlessly around start buying stuff we don't need it was hilarious."
206.0,Provider,"yeah I used to take my kids to target when they were like a little bit older just to like look at all the toys, just like the aisles of toys, you know it's just like a toy museum basically."
2299.0,Patient,yeah like.
206.0,Provider,"And then get like one of them, but just the whole like process of going and then looking at and playing with all the toys, it would like it would take like ours. And it was great I would I would go to starbucks and get coffee and then we'd go up to the toilet and just let him, let him loose."
2299.0,Patient,"Oh man yep that's right. yeah have added kids I mean I think parents do that all the time. Like it's fantastic for that stuff but yeah when you, but when you can't leave yeah. shutter a bit about that. Okay, so. And then. yeah. Well, I mean that's the JET. mm hmm and definitely amplified by feelings already have like what's going on what am I doing have I made the right decisions."
206.0,Provider,"mm hmm. yeah. yeah no it definitely makes me think like. Like where did I go wrong when i'm like you know in like the fourth hour of like being in this play pen and i'm just like oh God. Like what did I do wrong with my life like Why am I, like the one in this playpen and not the one like working from home like these other people who are like basically my age who have normal jobs and are in their office working."
2299.0,Patient,"there's probably been different times in your life, where people have looked at you and said the exact same thing. Right like Oh, it just looks like she has everything I wish I could be like her."
206.0,Provider,yeah maybe.
2299.0,Patient,yeah. This.
206.0,Provider,Or that one yeah there was definitely times when I had my shit like a lot more together. yeah and it was yeah kind of fun I know a fun life.
2299.0,Patient,"yeah, and I mean you've had this these big upheavals in your life. Pretty huge ones like massive massive life changing upheavals and now you're just trying to find all that again in bed a different version of it right."
206.0,Provider,yeah.
2299.0,Patient,"it's it so it's you know sort of naturally going to take some time and adjustment to get there. I mean you know anytime we find ourselves in a position where where we're miserable right, we have a challenge with a problem or multiple problems we we have the same choices, every time right, the choice is to stay miserable and do nothing. And the choice is the second option is to. not make a move or not necessarily do anything but sort of like accept it and choose to use your skills, whatever you have to tolerate the situation. And then the third choice is to strategize and figure out a way to use your skills to change it. I mean there's really no no other options right, those are your choices and every every challenge that you face. So here you are."
206.0,Provider,yep.
2299.0,Patient,it's tougher went to know what to do that when you have multiple challenges right and so much coming at you.
206.0,Provider,"yeah I feel like there's. A lot coming at me right now. and i'm here i've been kind of like butting heads with my partner. Like. Really, I don't think. yeah because I don't she doesn't really have any like experience with like. Like mental health problems or depression like I don't I don't think she's really prone to it, but I know she's not prone to it. But I don't think she's like really been around people who get it, or I don't think she really like understands it. And so to her it's just like. I don't know. I don't do like very like she's not like super. compassionate I guess about it."
2299.0,Patient,How are you are you able to talk to her about kind of expressing what you need from her and. How you want to. or yeah sort of like what you need in terms of support from her are you able to express it and.
206.0,Provider,"I don't try yeah I mean last night we got into it, because. I was complaining about I mean I said, like one little thing and i'm in a whole conversation that we were having. About. She was talking about how like not diverse living in the Midwest was. And, and how she didn't like it. And then somehow I said something about alameda. was like well meat is like pretty fucking white it's pretty like i'm having a hard time living here I don't think I would make it in the Midwest."
2299.0,Patient,Are you in the actual town of alameda.
206.0,Provider,mm hmm. yeah it's a former military.
2299.0,Patient,area right.
206.0,Provider,"mm hmm. yeah it's it's weird. Like it's a weird city it's not diverse. yeah there's not much going on and but you feel like really isolated because it's the island mm hmm so even though places are not that far, it still feels like like I feel like i'm living on an island."
2299.0,Patient,Now.
206.0,Provider,"And it's taken adjusting like i'm definitely still like trying to adjust to it but anyway, she like was like well, you and I need to reassess our Libyan situation then. And, and I just felt like she just she came in like really hot like it was almost like really like school D or something you know, like. It was just very like very negative and I was just like whoa whoa like I just I just said that one little thing like it's just alameda is not diverse like I understand you like to live here, and you feel safe here and like whatever that's cool like i'm not judging you. But then yeah she was like you should just move out because I don't want you to live here if you're not happy and like you know you're depressed and you should just you should just move out. and I was like well I can't. reach out yeah totally and also i'm like we signed a lease I can't just move out. she's like whatever like i'll figure it out. You know, we should just go our separate ways and. I was like well I committed to live here for a year and I signed a lease so i'm going to give it a year and then how about we make a decision when it gets closer to when our leases being up. she's just like well so i'm just supposed to like wait around for you to just like decide that you don't want to live here in whatever how many months and. But like okay so basically I was like, finally, it will take explain like listen I don't know. If it's that I really hate alameda or that i'm depressed. And so, like everything sucks. I don't have a lot of clarity, right now, so I can't say like what if living in alameda is really like detrimental to me because I don't know what is because there's so much going on. yeah and she always goes she'll be like like what. Like oh my God. Like it doesn't she doesn't. She doesn't get it."
2299.0,Patient,"yeah. sounds like she's having a hard time I thought is there, and if you ever want to bring her in for me to support you in any of those conversations i'm open to that so you know."
206.0,Provider,I don't really do like couples work but.
2299.0,Patient,"i'm happy to support you and maybe even and help explain kind of like. facilitate some conversations or. help with whatever might you know come to agreements around asking for what you need in terms of support and all of that, I know that can be really hard."
206.0,Provider,yeah it is really hard.
2299.0,Patient,"Especially with somebody who doesn't have a lot of experience with it yeah i'm happy to do that. Just let me know in advance, so that I can kind of prepare for it but um yeah."
206.0,Provider,Okay.
2299.0,Patient,"But I like the way you said that a lot, I really can appreciate the way you said that that. it's like I just don't know I just don't know if it's you know if this is depression or if I really hate it here like give me some time to work it out sort through this and I hear that she liked didn't really get it, but you said it perfectly."
206.0,Provider,"Well, once I said that she was like she got I don't know that seemed to be like sufficient, but she was like why didn't you just say that. Only because I so hard to figure out how to talk to you. Though like shouty she gets so like just firing you like, and just. yeah it's really. it's not the way that that I like to engage."
2299.0,Patient,"it's rattle was it like that, before you guys nicked it."
206.0,Provider,yeah yeah she's always been like that.
2299.0,Patient,"well. yeah I my offers is open, I think i'm a big proponent of. On this may not be the time for you, because you've got so much going on but i'm a really big proponent of communicating to partners about how. We want to be talked to right."
206.0,Provider,mm hmm. Like.
2299.0,Patient,"let's I really want to solve this with you, I want to partner with you, I want to stay together, I love you all of those things. And when you raise your voice to me, and it makes it really hard for me to stay calm. and have these conversations, or I feel worse and I start to sink into depression, rather than having a productive conversation for you so like i'm a big fan of. Being able to actually speak about how we need to be spoken to right please speak with speak to me calmly, if you can't do that in the moment that's it's fine to walk away until you can or whatever right."
206.0,Provider,yeah. I mean I yeah I don't know. I don't know how how far she's capable of like transforming the way I just think it's very like deeply ingrained. and very like yeah it's like old pattern stuff she probably got from like her parents or you know just really old ways of communicating.
2299.0,Patient,at her family. So you you're speaking with authority that's how it is.
206.0,Provider,yeah. I mean it's hard to say. I think I think it has to do with with that yeah yeah.
2299.0,Patient,So I.
206.0,Provider,"Think it's very it sounds like a child, like popping off or something like."
2299.0,Patient,Like that really reactive.
206.0,Provider,"reactive, and like raw."
2299.0,Patient,"yeah, as we say in the field she's not in her wise mind when she's communicating yes just purely emotional."
206.0,Provider,"yeah yeah. Action emotional and she just like gets on like a hair trigger. Like it doesn't take much to set her off. mm hmm. Especially like yeah she works, a lot like she's already like stretched really thin."
2299.0,Patient,uh huh so she's depleted and she doesn't she struggles with her communication style so it's. yeah kind of a perfect. perfect storm. huh yeah.
206.0,Provider,yeah.
2299.0,Patient,"So we're about out of time today because I have to run go run a group and a few minutes but i'm in I were already scheduled for next week right we're doing and next week is a longer appointment and. So between this week and next week. What, what is the most helpful, I mean I have things that I can suggest, but I would like to hear like what do you how are you going to manage what are your strategies here."
206.0,Provider,"I don't know I need to. I need to reassess I gotta do something like. I either need to like quit my job. Or, I mean I might need to drop a class. that's another thing that's like stressing me out."
2299.0,Patient,took on.
206.0,Provider,yeah yeah I took on a little much for sure OK.
2299.0,Patient,"So those are options. So we can take the next week to just kind of consider your options. that's not okay. yeah and then somewhere in there, can you build in I call them mood boosters but like. Some mood boosting activities right I don't know."
206.0,Provider,"Oh yeah I went to I tried out a Kung fu class. Good yeah. How was that definitely boosted my moon it was good, I mean I found I can't sign up for the school because it's too expensive, and you have to commit to like six months at a time. which I can't do."
2299.0,Patient,Can you do drop in or. No okay.
206.0,Provider,"That so that's unfortunate I don't know I might just go back to the place, I was training before and Albany just deal with the traffic."
