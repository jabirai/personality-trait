14961.0,Patient,"Okay i'm. Sorry. Sorry, I forgot the door. i'm sorry it's been stressful. stressful a couple weeks. He wanted me to talk to you with some like you know that I mean you, you know you've had a specific groups and symbols of us and we've had a lot going on, you can see that it's high stress. High stress testing quite priceless lately um keep kind of going into a huge crisis mode this weekend granddaughters left the House burning down. The argument with his mother blew up really, really very good in the middle of all of it and it's been a nightmare. And i've been trying my best to just keep my levels normal so that I can provide some kind of pin level piece for everyone and. And he has, we have also also speaking, and he has some to realize that that when he is in crisis, mode, he cannot medicate himself in the proper way to medicate and now he is a point where he is very concerning. To continue using Linux and wanting to know the best way to be able to type trade off and he literally took his last few this morning."
298.0,Provider,"Okay, so he did not pick up the prescription that I wrote four days ago."
14961.0,Patient,No he picked it up.
298.0,Provider,And he took 42 tablets in the last four days.
14961.0,Patient,I wasn't that many was that I have no idea.
298.0,Provider,"It was 42 tablets, it was yeah."
14961.0,Patient,yeah no idea. Is that he got two weeks that it was one twice a day or something that was all I don't know. Oh.
298.0,Provider,Three times a day he's done 42 tablets and.
14961.0,Patient,"went into huge crisis mode and I mean. i'm i'm a person, but i'm not the one who can stop someone from something they're going through. Okay, and."
298.0,Provider,"This is pretty major i'm not going to do this on via the Internet i'm not going to do a tight ration I was worried about doing a citation with them anyways but if he really has gone through 42 tablets in. In four days, that means that he is addiction level to this medication."
14961.0,Patient,that's why he wanted he actually. stated that he wants to be put on mental health records that then it's not a medical term because he cannot unfolded.
298.0,Provider,"yeah she needs to go education taking. yeah he needs to go in patient at this point so. I can call for some help or you can go to the emergency room. He can go to the emergency room and get some help off of this, but this is where I bow out. To this is way too above my head serious have an addiction for Internet."
14961.0,Patient,"kind of all, I. think I can, I can tell you, industry, this is not something that fumble like something that is the failure current that's The thing that like literally everything like trashed him on like he was like. Like breaking down and sobbing and crying and mean it was really, really, really, really genuinely really tough these last few days with and I honestly have not seen him in a mode like that, for over 10 years. And I mean i've i've known him since I was 15."
298.0,Provider,"I totally believe you but but three milligrams a day is my absolute top dose and that's three milligrams a day. He got 42 milligrams oh that's like 11 milligrams a day that he was going through his dependence on this drug is going to be super high, which means he needs to be supervised to come down off of it because he's going to need medications to come off of it."
14961.0,Patient,"None so something that I absolutely no he won't do. He will go I know he won't I just I mean like I said known him since i've been in the game, and he would suffer and."
298.0,Provider,"they'll go into seizures he will go into seizures with that kind of and and I told them that you know, I was really nervous about giving it to him. But he's got to go into the emergency room and get more medication. Do you guys have a family doctor."
14961.0,Patient,"yeah he he started Dr Linda Honda I mean I mean I could. try and get Oh, I have an Roi was hurt you and I can try to get a hold of for tomorrow. and see he just he just he's like I have to get a hold of the oldest one, probably because I know that I can't control this and I need some help and I needed on my record that this is the medication that can't be prescribed to me again in the future."
298.0,Provider,"I agree, he can't do this is. He needs a higher level of care and he needs it right away and. we're not the we're not the right setup for him. And if I have any information for you tomorrow. I will reach out to you. But other than today he could start going into seizures and my recommendation is to take him to the hospital. and"
14961.0,Patient,"He is not going to go there and it's like the hospital here right now there, they would look at him and tell him go home and I mean literally they went to my granddaughter not three, then they said she's fine get her out of here, we got 20 phobic patients so that's. Like, not even a possibility to even get in the hospital right now. it's like quite literally an impossibility here. Even if I if I even if I had the fitness and lose the ability to talk him into doing something like that it's just they're not. yeah I honestly say i'm sorry there's a little bit of that hospital of me so mad when my granddaughter couldn't breathe and they literally told her to. Take her daughter home because he didn't need help i'm like oh my God, are you kidding me. So I definitely know they're not going to see him they deal with people here off those people at a time and hospitals with the heroin addiction and stuff and he would just be implemented in that path, and they would not be him. And i'm just being brutally honest with a hospital."
298.0,Provider,"yeah I I I know what you're talking about. I am so sorry I, this is where I bow out and he's got to get to a higher level of care i'm going to ask a lot i'm going to ask around tomorrow, maybe you need to travel him to a detox down south. and get him into a detox somewhere where it can be supervised coming off of it. i'm going to put in a call to my supervisor and tell them what happened but i'm not going to prescribe any more xanax. At my can't even that the pharmacy will shut me down so fast."
14961.0,Patient,I. I he pretty much just put it into know how what wait what is gonna happen and stuff enough why i'm sitting here talking because I don't.
298.0,Provider,think you know.
14961.0,Patient,"Like I said. isn't something like i've known him my whole life, this is this is honestly, one of the first times i've seen him in such cases, I mean it was like the. house nearly bringing down the grandkids living with diabetes care realizing that he hasn't even like grieve the loss of his grandparents. Because the House burning down like literally made him realize, I have an all my life I have seen him and not and not kind of a crisis before and I did everything that I knew how to do with my social work degree and began his life to be my advice to you. Often, through the whole thing. Thank you, please just a second, please. All right, sorry."
298.0,Provider,"that's okay I my heart goes out to you guys right now he's really hurting he's gotta get into some sort of benzo taper somewhere. And i'm all I may have something by tomorrow morning i'll talk with my supervisor, where he could go or what to do, but my again. My recommendation is go to the emergency."
14961.0,Patient,"Like he's not he just he definitely he said that to me or that even to put the federal on on the on there, and everything because he knows that's an interesting thing to they put that on his his behavioral health mental health records that those medications. or not non advisable to."
