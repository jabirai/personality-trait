705.0,Provider,"that's good. That floating sensation are able to escape you know all the other of how you're feeling for a few minutes. Oh. I know this is this has been a tough one, for you."
10170.0,Patient,"yeah I can't get out of this one, for some reason, like I have days, where i'm fine, but then it just kicks back in it kicked back in a little while ago."
705.0,Provider,"And nothing was like a precursor for you, this one just doesn't have any any rhyme or reason."
10170.0,Patient,I think it's my sleep I couldn't really sleep again last night.
705.0,Provider,"That makes sense, then briana is that. Was sleep decoration it just makes you up and down and all around where you're so out of stores. Okay. Do you take anything for sleeping to help. How many hours of sleep, are you getting per night."
10170.0,Patient,"Last night I don't know because I kept waking up like every hour and having to move and rotate and then, who is just a pain."
705.0,Provider,"Okay, and. How they so you're having interrupted sleep. And so, really, maybe, an average of four hours. Maybe okay. and has this been going on, like all week."
10170.0,Patient,yeah on and off all week.
705.0,Provider,Prior to this week hasn't been happening like almost all month.
10170.0,Patient,"No, it just started."
705.0,Provider,"Okay, so you haven't had a history of like insomnia, or anything like that, before."
10170.0,Patient,I had way like. Like maybe a year ago.
705.0,Provider,"Okay. And when you had it a year ago, how did you resolve it."
10170.0,Patient,"They try getting me track it down, but I ended up getting serotonin syndrome, so I had to work through it myself basically."
705.0,Provider,And are you are you open to marry just seeing if there's anything else that she could give you that's different than treasured oh.
10170.0,Patient,yeah possibly.
705.0,Provider,"So part of it is the the sleep, I mean that definitely once, you said that brianna I was like that makes more sense now of where this would just because, just to appear out of nowhere seemed a little bit different for you."
10170.0,Patient,"yeah it's it's been coming and going and it's really, really like draining me."
705.0,Provider,"mm hmm. To make it through you know I just say take it day by day, are you going to stay on the boat, or are you going to go and maybe be with your grandmother."
10170.0,Patient,"Yes, i'm gonna go see my mom she needed some help with stuff, so I think it'll get me away for a little bit and see some people and i'm hoping that will help."
705.0,Provider,"I like that plan, and I think that why you're going through it, that that would be good to have your supports there, especially with the not sleeping can really make where the thought patterns are off your mood is so off."
10170.0,Patient,"I had I have really bad thoughts, the other day, when I was driving like whenever i'm driving and i'm not a good headspace I always think I should just crashed the car and I don't know why I get into that headspace."
705.0,Provider,When you know when you thought about crashing the car what stopped you.
10170.0,Patient,My mom I can't do that to my mom and my grandma.
705.0,Provider,"mm hmm. And, did you pull over."
10170.0,Patient,"And I took a couple deep breaths and turn the music up, so I could just kind of like zone out my thoughts."
705.0,Provider,mm hmm. And that worked.
10170.0,Patient,And then I pulled off and I just kind of like relax for a little bit. And I texted my friend.
705.0,Provider,"mm hmm. You did everything right Rana. Taking the deep breaths to put in the music got to pulling off the road to calling your friend. I mean, even in that that that where you're filling at the most you're still able to intervene and you did it. Are you having any of those feelings today."
10170.0,Patient,not yet.
705.0,Provider,"Do you feel that it's you know, like to go to your moms which I think is great, especially right now, like you said, while you're in that headspace to surround yourself with your loved ones, do you feel it's it's safe for you to drive to go see them."
10170.0,Patient,"Right now, I feel okay to do it, it just happens, while i'm in the car like out of nowhere like i'll be driving and then these thoughts just popped in my head, while i'm driving like I don't think about it, when I get into the car, but then it just happens, while i'm driving."
705.0,Provider,"And you just had this happen, yesterday, but you didn't you didn't act on it, which was good and it didn't proceed from there, I mean did you have yesterday any other advanced thoughts of doing something else to yourself. So it's mainly in the car and when you're driving. Could you have your mom pick you up today and just explain to your mom."
10170.0,Patient,She still can't drive her arms still messed up.
705.0,Provider,mm hmm. uber or anything like that.
10170.0,Patient,i'm going to try driving i'll just turn the music up brief. And just see how that goes.
705.0,Provider,"yeah and even if an inkling of any of this comes to just pull over call call your mom just to be able to do like you've done before. I think definitely with the sleep and talking to Mary I mean, these are things that you can do with the medication piece, and then you're already doing some of the coping strategies. But the medication is going to take you know, sometimes a couple of days to get in there and to start to really work and so. How can you create the strongest supports like can you stay then where you're not alone, and on the boat."
10170.0,Patient,yeah I was going to stay at my grandma's House tonight with my mom and my grandma.
705.0,Provider,mm hmm.
10170.0,Patient,Okay.
705.0,Provider,"When you're driving in the car if you put your mom or somebody on speaker phone. Does that distract the thoughts. Can you do that today, while you're driving. yeah right and, if at all, if you get to where you're about to and you're nervous with it, then I would suggest not not doing it and finding an alternative like uber or something like that."
10170.0,Patient,yeah.
705.0,Provider,They will go okay. I like to know that you're in agreements with getting somebody on the phone who can you call it a day when you decide to head over.
10170.0,Patient,My mom.
705.0,Provider,"And mom gets it. Okay. So it's getting you there today, having it, you know it is part of it is that waiting period of getting your your sleeping again where things can start to connect and and you'll feel better. says school work does it does provide a destruction."
10170.0,Patient,and worked on it yesterday for a few hours and then went to the pool.
705.0,Provider,yeah. And you were able to focus on the work.
10170.0,Patient,"yeah I was able, I told myself, I can work through these four assignments and i'll take a nap and then i'll go to the pool."
705.0,Provider,"And then you did it. yeah yeah. that's like the belief in yourself Rana is just like look I know right now is is tough on you, but you're still pulling yourself together and going, you know what not going to let this stop me i'm still getting my work done. And you did it. And going to the pool and having a limit like that that's that's a great technique. yeah mm hmm. Is there today like are you to do some more studying two."
10170.0,Patient,"Or, more like I don't know I haven't decided, yet I want to work on it today."
705.0,Provider,"mm hmm does it take you out of your head, while you're working on assignments."
10170.0,Patient,"not always because sometimes depending on the assignment like I had an assignment I don't know few months ago, where it was on a raid case and it just brought back some bad memories, so it depends on the assignment that i'm doing at that time."
705.0,Provider,"yeah now that that makes sense, is that you have a topic like that, and where you're relating to it than that yeah that would be difficult. May I ask what your topic is this time."
10170.0,Patient,"I think it's just not sure it was. I forget where it is right now, but I think i'm safe with these simon's right now."
705.0,Provider,"Okay, so something that because right now, you know if it's something like that, where you're relating probably not the best time to. yeah who work on this i'm into knowing yourself. And then the now. If, today, you can put in some naptime if you're tired to just take the couple hours, when you can. Is it your grandmother to that has the pool or pool."
10170.0,Patient,"The pool is in the Community, and my grandma's house. So it's or the Community so it's a little bit. Just a walk up the hill."
705.0,Provider,"The the pool to me sounds like a little bit of your pool therapy where you're like you know what I can just be in the sun get my vitamin D and then relax for a minute. Do you have your cat to on board with you right now. Oh, oh. wow alright right. Oh, I see helping you out."
10170.0,Patient,"yeah she's she's been a good girl. She hasn't left my side, since last night because I got in last night, and she hasn't left my side because she knows something's wrong."
705.0,Provider,yeah as she she can sense it. mm hmm now. Does she stay on the boat when you go to your mom's or she goes with you.
10170.0,Patient,Now she stays on the boat my grandma's allergic so my cat is on the boat.
705.0,Provider,"Oh, a cat is probably like, though, has so many things to do this entertaining throughout the day."
10170.0,Patient,yeah and then people always come by to check honors there's everyone loves around the dog so.
705.0,Provider,"Well, I think you know, like he said she's on a is willing to wear a collar and alicia she's probably famous by now and that area. yeah. Well, I know brianna it's. It does seem like, with your medication, that is possible that you were at the therapeutic level and now something. changed, you know and trying to figure that out if it's the sleep component, with it, or if it's just the medication piece that's not allowing you to go into deep sleep."
10170.0,Patient,yeah yeah i'm hoping that once I get the lead to to after a couple days i'm hoping it'll help.
705.0,Provider,"mm hmm. Are their thoughts and things like that too that's that's part of the, the problem with not sleeping like when you we when you wake up, are you thinking of things."
10170.0,Patient,I don't think so.
705.0,Provider,"i'll cry and my apologies for asking you so many questions for, and I know it's just like i'm trying to go through it and see what it is and rule out because to me, then, if it's if it's thoughts that are coming up, you and I can work on that part."
10170.0,Patient,Knowing no.
705.0,Provider,But that doesn't seem your case right now.
10170.0,Patient,"No, I can't I can't figure anything out, the only thing I can figure out is I can't sleep and I can't figure out why I can't sleep."
705.0,Provider,"yeah. And that makes sense, with going back to the medication it's the the medication that's going to kick in and then help you with that that extra piece."
10170.0,Patient,yeah I hope so.
705.0,Provider,"Can you, then, I know that they haven't had it yet if let's say your pharmacy doesn't have it can they can they send it to somewhere fairly close by that does have it."
10170.0,Patient,yeah I had to that one time before so if they don't have it i'll see if I can pick it up from another location.
705.0,Provider,because to me this is like a higher level of concern where it's just like no I need I need that MED. You have your safety plan close by.
10170.0,Patient,What do you mean.
705.0,Provider,"The safety plan, where it has like your coping strategies and things like that to do an event that you go more into a crisis."
10170.0,Patient,i've never made one before.
705.0,Provider,"I am checking your chart right now. And you're absolutely right, so I think it's time to start a safety plan, do you mind. Because what you're explaining right now it's a good time to at least have it to focus on. And it's just like this is what i'm going to do, can you tell me three warning signs that when you know you're headed into crisis, and they can be thoughts images mood or situation or behavior."
10170.0,Patient,"um I just get a feeling that i'm off. And then, like I get fidgety."
705.0,Provider,Okay.
10170.0,Patient,i'm not sure about third one.
705.0,Provider,Do you get where. Maybe the lack of sleep or too much sleep.
10170.0,Patient,can get out of bed.
705.0,Provider,"Lack of sleep. And then, if we think of internal coping strategies, and these are three things that can take your mind off of your problems without contacting another person so that can be relaxation or physical activities anything like that."
10170.0,Patient,i'm reading. Listening to music. and yoga.
705.0,Provider,perfect. And do you think to another strategy to add in there is to either depending on which House you have in which which pet that you have there. is maybe spend some time with with okay. And then social settings. These are things that people are social settings that would provide you with distractions. Such as going to the pool without if that's something that you could continue to do.
10170.0,Patient,yeah I can only do that when i'm in California.
705.0,Provider,"What are some other things, and then that way, I know, depending on where you are it's going to look a little bit different."
10170.0,Patient,i'm going for a walk.
705.0,Provider,mm hmm.
10170.0,Patient,going to the gym.
705.0,Provider,And who are your main three people that you can call if you need help.
10170.0,Patient,My mom and my two best friends.
705.0,Provider,"what's your mom's name brianna. debbie debbie. db db IE. Yes, Okay, and then your two best friends names."
10170.0,Patient,jaden and Jessica.
705.0,Provider,"And it's jaden J a y di n. yeah Okay, and then with your your mom and jaden and JESSICA, you have their phone numbers, probably in your your phone contacts. yeah okay. there's them with professional numbers to there's always the suicide intervention line which is 988. Okay, but if you can't remember that just dial 911 and they'll give you the help that you need or if you're having thoughts and stuff to the nearest er. And then texts wise, have you tried the 741741 the crisis text line."
10170.0,Patient,"No, I haven't."
705.0,Provider,"it's a counselor and it's not specifically for suicide so let's say two in the morning you can't sleep, you could reach out to a counselor and just be like look, this is what's going on, and you text back and forth."
10170.0,Patient,Okay 741741.
705.0,Provider,Right. And i'm going to i'm going to type this up today and I will send you a copy to front brianna but the 741741.
10170.0,Patient,And the other 9812.
705.0,Provider,"Right, the 988 is the suicide hotline and so a counselor crisis counselor for suicide will talk to you, there is some 41741 is more of a crisis counselor for a broader range of things. Okay, and then there's always two bright heart health is to call us if i'm if I have a cancellation or something I will absolutely meet with you um let's say in the event that I do not have availability someone else will talk to you to just get you through that time. So those are some some of you know, the different people that you could call what are two things to that you can do to keep your environment safe."
10170.0,Patient,What do you mean.
705.0,Provider,"Sometimes people will say like not have weapons they're like if sometimes their thoughts tell them, you know, to take a gun or something like that that they don't have weapons on site."
10170.0,Patient,I can't think of anything.
705.0,Provider,"One with animals, especially is when they're your support, you know, is to have wherever you are your pets is that pretty much each place you're at you have your pets."
10170.0,Patient,I have one cat in California and other cat in Arizona.
705.0,Provider,"And to keep your environment safe to could be just to know that you have people, you can call. Can you give me a couple of reasons why life is worth living."
10170.0,Patient,family. and friends.
705.0,Provider,"family, friends and how about all all of your kiddos. Your kittens."
10170.0,Patient,Oh yeah and then.
705.0,Provider,"Do you feel any sense of hope for for the future, like with career or things like that."
10170.0,Patient,No.
705.0,Provider,"Okay, said, probably right now, just to it's just like let's not even focus on that let's just bring it back to the other things. yeah okay. Good good yeah definitely what this is let's just take it day by day and what we don't want to do is like with yesterday you did exactly what you needed to do to keep yourself safe Rana. You turn up the music, you did the deep breathing called a friend, like all of those are great skills we don't want you to just have those thoughts and then it turned into you have a plan and then you act on that plan. And today brianna you don't have a plan to harm yourself."
10170.0,Patient,No.
705.0,Provider,"If it did get to that point, who would be your first call."
10170.0,Patient,My mom or jaden.
705.0,Provider,"Good and it's more of just keeping this automatic, where it says like i'm not going to listen to these thoughts i'm going to do what I need to do to keep myself safe. And then, today, I know what the pharmacy is getting that. You know where you can get your medication and then with Mary i'll let Mary know to that you haven't had sleep in a week is that pretty correct and about a week it's been interrupted."
10170.0,Patient,hits been on and off like there's some days i'm flying some days i'm not so it's been on and off all week.
705.0,Provider,"mm hmm. So I will email or just to let her know that we met today and that you know we have a safety plan, and so, when I send it to you if you can. Either print it out or people will just keep it like in the phone notes or anything and then, when you're having any thoughts just take it out and just it's like this is my roadmap. Okay, this is what i'm going to do. All along and if you need to start you know, sometimes we need to adjust it where you start to add different things there to that you happen to. So what's next for you after after we end this session, what are you going to be doing."

Or, then you have it, and it's easy to see. And if you have any you know questions later on to for me. i'm just gonna put hi that we all just send it off now."
10170.0,Patient,"Okay, thank you."
705.0,Provider,"With what we have planned so far brianna is it does everything seem like stuff that you can do, and you can carry on. Okay, I just want to make sure that again that it progresses, and that you can't sleep you're really feeling like you said, where you're where you're even more so off to don't hesitate. You know if it's really bad go on to that nearest er just to check out to roll out, you know, sometimes there's men, you know, sometimes people may have medical or whatever else it may be, is just being able to get the help that you need at that time. Okay Okay, and then I know you're going to pick up your mess and then you're going to go to your moms and just hang out with them and get all the love and hugs that you need today. yeah i'll cry.

She is sharing that she will contact her mom today to drive to her mom's House why her mom is on the phone so there's safety measures have been put in place, but. Today her her risk is more of a moderate risk she's saying today that she's not actively suicide there's not a plan there's not intent but yesterday, she she did so that is it for right now."
