15858.0,Patient,hi.
484.0,Provider,i'm got this worked out and were you able to speak to your pain doctor great I spoke with her and it sounds like she seemed very on board with everything. Okay yeah is that and she kind of tell you what we discussed.
15858.0,Patient,yeah kind of just reiterated what we talked about last night.
484.0,Provider,"Exactly Okay, so now that that's confirmed, I guess, I didn't want to send a prescription before I knew I will go ahead and send over that prescription i'm going to just put in the chat so I can. I was thinking of X sort of a slightly easier way for us to do. let's see. Okay, let me put this in so that. And this is what will be in the prescription also. i'm just putting in the chat So you can see it written down and then maybe copy it."
15858.0,Patient,Okay.
484.0,Provider,just give me one second. Still sound like a good plan to you.
15858.0,Patient,"yeah. Sorry, I didn't sleep well last night okay. I push myself too much. packing and yeah so to the chiropractor this morning for my neck and oh. Goodness I just hit a wall."
484.0,Provider,Okay sorry about this. and
15858.0,Patient,"it's okay to take the suboxone with everything else I you recorded that I am taking currently my supplement and my blood pressure, medicine."
484.0,Provider,"Yes, I am not looking directly at your meds right this minute, can you just remind me what they are."
15858.0,Patient,So take the low certain. And now I take it in the morning for my blood pressure and. The travel don't I take sometimes your sleep. yep and then I have all the supplements for my naturopath. And then I take my hormone. Unless i'm on my cycle progesterone.
484.0,Provider,Okay yeah all of those should be find you know what progesterone dose you take and what dose of the last certain you take.
15858.0,Patient,Certain is 100 100 milligrams and then it's 12.5 so it's it's combos the edge of course I died.
484.0,Provider,Oh okay.
15858.0,Patient,"Well, certain. So it's 112.5 and then the progesterone is. Generic for premium 100 milligrams at night. Or what am I, my period."
484.0,Provider,"Okay, and let me just update the low sartain real quick. let's continue. So all of those are fine, the trouser Joan is the only one that has any sort of potential interaction so there's something called serotonin syndrome, which is when people are."
15858.0,Patient,worried about that.
484.0,Provider,"yeah several medications that interact with the serotonin system, which is one of the brain hormones and chemicals. trouser don't it does have that 100 milligrams is a relatively lower dose it's used at lower doses for sleep, it was initially developed this anti depressant and it was used in much higher doses like even it like 250 milligrams. Though I don't anticipate you need to get a very high dose of the buprenorphine, and so I don't think that will make a difference, but. Just you know, in the interest of extra caution the things to and again i'm really not at all worried about it with these two medications at the doses you're taking them, but the the dose the sorry the symptoms, you would look for like muscle rigidity stiffness. Sometimes, like feeling sometimes will get feverish or or confusion lethargy again i'm not really worried about that, but that's that would be the only theoretical otherwise there's really no shouldn't be any issue with the other medications that you take."
15858.0,Patient,It doesn't I don't feel like it's really worth it for me to take it don't feel like it's helping me get a good night's sleep and still waking up in the middle of the night mm per hour. yeah so it's not even helping me I don't even. know why. yeah and silly.
484.0,Provider,Who prescribes that one to you.
15858.0,Patient,and pain management doctor that you think.
484.0,Provider,"yeah I might I might say let's not make two changes at once, because I would hate for you to feel unwell and not know if it was due to stopping the transit owner starting to buprenorphine, and so I might rather we kind of stay, you know make one change at a time. Okay, and then we could."
15858.0,Patient,Take it every night I do.
484.0,Provider,"yeah yeah, so in that case, then I think it's fine either way since you're taking it every night. But the that would be i'd say that's not make two changes at once and not know what the differences and and I know buprenorphine does have side effects, like any medication so under which stomach upset and. Is one or not, yes, and you feel light headed or dizzy again we're starting at these very small."
15858.0,Patient,"nuisance to get those feelings, sometimes with a purpose. right here, I think enough."
484.0,Provider,"yeah and but if you're feeling that, then obviously we want to know about it but we're turning it at such low doses that I don't anticipate you'll have that issue, but I think so form for us to. You know, be mindful of I mean just think. Okay, so let me put that in the chat Can you see that."
15858.0,Patient,yeah. My kids iPad so I don't know like i'm just gonna take a picture of it.
484.0,Provider,"So, on that day, five would be the day that I die I don't want you also taking the percocet obviously we're gonna be talking and so will."
15858.0,Patient,yeah well know how it's going. And I think that in my notes.
484.0,Provider,yeah we'll know how it's going but that's kind of the goal is that you should feel better and not. not feel like you want to take the percocet.
15858.0,Patient,"Okay yeah okay. And then I know. You had mentioned before, and I know in my email I like I want to have a plan. To we know."
484.0,Provider,Yes.
15858.0,Patient,"So i'm not on it too long, and then a good partner."
484.0,Provider,"yep yeah so that. Absolutely, I think you know once you're feeling kind of stable and that's why i'd rather we stay at as low dose as possible, so you know you might not even need to go up as high as a dose if you're doing fine at three milligrams you know one milligram three times per day, then great."
15858.0,Patient,Okay.
484.0,Provider,"You know that's that would be fantastic it's just hard to predict. And I don't think people with chronic pain respond to lower doses since people know friend is a pain medication and it's actually a pretty potent pain medication that. That you may be fine on even a lower dose and some other formulations we use for pain are really small doses, so I don't want us to be you know stuck with this, I want us to adapt to see what you how things are going."
15858.0,Patient,Good.
484.0,Provider,"Okay, so you know in putting in the prescription. I will order it as films there's a two milligram film and so i'm going to order it with the two milligram films just because they're easy to cut in half."
15858.0,Patient,So for me to cut them with like a little further.
484.0,Provider,"yeah yeah it's fine you know it comes as like a rectangle so it's fairly easy to to cut. But so you can cut the two milligrams I think it's It also comes as a tab and you can cut the the two milligram tabs into quarters, I think it's probably easier to cut the film's. into quarters, but if there's any issue getting it like I said, I have the pharmacy and. Then just let us know right away because I could always like if they have the tabs like I was whichever tab so there's really no difference, other than what i'm thinking is going to be easier for you."
15858.0,Patient,Okay okay.
484.0,Provider,"So you'll be using you know, a quarter of a tab and then a quarter of a tab twice a day, and then a half three times so it'll be kind of like I said very small amounts."
15858.0,Patient,"Okay okay yep. So I know we're doing a nightly check in at 6pm next week. yep um. If there's anything that happens, like this emergent or any like pressing issue, how would I reach out to."
484.0,Provider,get what contact info do they have the ability to send me like a direct message what info do you have the care navigators.
15858.0,Patient,"I don't I mean I have messages they've left me I have email, but I don't."
484.0,Provider,I mean i'm sure I can ask.
15858.0,Patient,As far as like a direct line with. Your question about care I don't. Okay i've never been given like it.
484.0,Provider,"Okay, let me actually find I don't know because typically the messages that I get. come through the internal system. You see what she says waiting to hear back. Not hearing back from the care. navigator since I usually work in the evenings I think the care never good are usually with is not working right now. I just see, let me ask this person actually hold on there's somebody on I can ask. Did you get a new reminder for this appointment just out of curiosity or did you just."
15858.0,Patient,set an alarm last night.

15858.0,Patient,So let me.
484.0,Provider,"erase that picture and i'm sending you a new one. thing, as I was reading the prescription, I noticed that. Alright, let me correct that. i'm gonna make it even more specific to one quarter film."
15858.0,Patient,Now going forward we just do this prescription week by week basis right.
484.0,Provider,"First yeah and we can do longer than that, if needed, also. Okay, here we go. Do you have the compliance virtual clinic link. i'm not i'm going to copy it and. i'm sending i'll put it in the chat after put this thing in. That there's like a there's a. There is a like a zoom like basically clinic that you could just pop into."
15858.0,Patient,Okay i'm 13 my email.
484.0,Provider,Just double check out of our system one fourth film one fourth film twice per. gram would have filmed price per day one milligram one half three times per day one from yesterday okay there we go that's the correct one. And then i'm sending you the link for the virtual. You may want to cut and if you can cut and paste that link. I can put it in the email to you also.
15858.0,Patient,"Okay, that would be helpful, maybe I can always manually but it's just easier to."
484.0,Provider,yeah it's not make a mistake. Let me do that now. Okay. So you have that link as well.
15858.0,Patient,it's like a zoom meeting it's always.
484.0,Provider,Like a virtual meeting room is what they kind of caught like a virtual clinic.
15858.0,Patient,yep anytime. OK. And then.
484.0,Provider,"let's say. So. Alright, so back to. Alright, so i'm just putting in the instructions that it's. For the patients are actually going to see see written instructions for initiation because it doesn't give me enough characters to write that whole thing out. i'm going to give you enough for seven days that way, we have a little bit of buffer in case there's difficulty getting it."
15858.0,Patient,Okay.
484.0,Provider,Even they're not going to start until Monday.
15858.0,Patient,"And I just. When I wake up, I would take that first. Instead of a percocet."
484.0,Provider,"Correct. On the first day I wait well I would give yourself an hour to see how you feel. from taking the medication. But then that day sort of when you feel like you're needing that you would normally take a percocet the same way you feel you should take the percocet again if you don't take the percocet you will feel the withdrawal right. yeah okay. So you know the times that people feel withdrawal with this process is because you're not taking what you would normally take because you're thinking about not taking it. yeah so what it should be as a more natural process where you don't feel like you need to take it. Okay first day I expect that you'll take perks that right. Okay, you know but, but then that'll decrease OK OK so i'm putting it in it'll be 12 films that you'll get for the week you know because it'll be. You know if we get you up to the one film three times per day and again we may not but that's Okay, if you i'd rather have you not run out, because that would be worse than you'd have control. And then i'm gonna i'm changing the pharmacy again it's defaulting to that one it is defaulting excuse me to that. That same."
15858.0,Patient,united.
484.0,Provider,"United so sorry. If, at some point, you may want to update that with. However, you got that registered in the first place. But i'm changing it to the rite aid. it's thinking, but I know it popped up yesterday. still thinking. Not. not finding the pharmacy but I know it found it yesterday. it's like it's frozen. let's say. Try that again. Try that again. hey can we go through the whole thing again sorry about this. There we go okay rite aid 1720 aviation boulevard now it's working. Okay, so it's 12 films seven days. let's see. Alright looks like it's all set."
15858.0,Patient,Okay.
484.0,Provider,"All right, so yeah you can give them a call like obviously take some a little bit, but and then. Certainly reach out to that that clinic if they'll be able to connect there's a whole list of people that work on the prescriptions so that clinic could also like you would let the. If you popped in there, you would let them know there's an issue with prescription and needs to be changed. And then they would also have the pharmacy we actually usually call directly to the prescriber if they're having an issue, but if you need to navigate you could do that and then there's a whole list of people that work on the prescriptions and they do work on Saturdays. Okay yeah. Okay okay."
15858.0,Patient,"All right, all right, so I won't talk to you before i'll talk to you a six o'clock on Monday, but you'll take again just it's one quarter of the film see how it goes that first day and then we'll go from there."
