298.0,Provider,"Well they're very fat, I mean the pristiq is at the very beginning, starting dose and so, if you're going to treat. If we're going to treat anxiety and depression, we need to continue to climb, I imagine, somewhere between 204 hundred, is where we would find the sweet spot that.

11092.0,Patient,I worked in insurance.
298.0,Provider,Okay.
11092.0,Patient,actuarial analyst.
298.0,Provider,"Is the benzo trope pain. If you want to divide the tablet in half, if you don't need that much to control the restlessness. You can divide the tablet and half. One of the problems with benzodiazepine is it can cause dry mouth and. Yes, things like that. And that's no fun, but it does take away that agitation restlessness that the abilify is causing. Now, as far as the seroquel they gave that to you for sleep."
11092.0,Patient,than to treat sorry the.
298.0,Provider,manic.
11092.0,Patient,"Yes, yes yeah that's."
298.0,Provider,"um. And so, and the other thing that I have you taking is. zyprexa. Two tabs at bedtime."
11092.0,Patient,A spin off.
298.0,Provider,say that again.
11092.0,Patient,Separate says that.
298.0,Provider,The 2.5 milligram. olanzapine olanzapine. That number five.
11092.0,Patient,I don't think i'm taking that right now we have four different.
298.0,Provider,"Okay, then i'm going to take it off. Of I kind of don't want you taking it and. here's the reason why. You had with that one you have three anti-psychotics that's a little heavy for somebody to have three anti-psychotics one. is good, so when going up on the pristiq the pristiq in the abilify they work together really well at Depression and anxiety that seroquel is used for sleep, but if we can stabilize you and get that to come down that's less of an anti psychotic and the benzodiazepine is for. Side effects. So you can try this it's called gabba penton you can take it at bedtime and see if it keeps you asleep. Okay, if it keeps you asleep yay. I will say take. i'll put take two tablets two capsules at bedtime two caps, but the first night just take one capsule to take two caps PO. Q hs sleep. prn sleep, so you only need to use this as needed like if you're exhausted don't worry about it."
11092.0,Patient,Okay it's.
298.0,Provider,"what's this medicine is been studies are starting to show, is it increases Stage three and four sleep there's not any other medicine out there that. increases those. Those time periods of sleep there's a lot of medicine out there, that will help you fall asleep, but it won't keep you asleep."
11092.0,Patient,I see.
298.0,Provider,"A long term plan for you would be to start getting you to sleep and you only use the seroquel as you start to feel you're getting manic. Then you would take the seroquel and so that we, you can start to self regulate we're not there yet. But that's where I want to be. Is that you start being very in tune with your emotions and. yeah so that's that's my thought that way. how's your home life."
11092.0,Patient,"Oh, my is fine, good."
298.0,Provider,um anything new happening in your life.
11092.0,Patient,No.
298.0,Provider,"Nothing nothing okay. Alright, so we're we went to two pills of the antidepressant pristiq okay all right and we went down on the abilify just five milligrams. Okay, good deal all right, do you have any questions about your medications."
