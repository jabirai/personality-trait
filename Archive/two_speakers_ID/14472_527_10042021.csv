Okay, so. A lot of counseling and they stick me. In a mental hospital for two years, because it was supposed to be for a quick 30 day thing right well they got an interview with my parents and they wouldn't release me to them.

527.0,Provider,Okay.
14472.0,Patient,"You know, which I mean maybe that would be a healthy way to begin with, for a lot of people instead of just cramming tons of extra food in and they're overweight and then. What do I do, then they starve just to get back to their weight and then they overeat so you know I had two parents are always overweight not not obese but but pretty darn close couple times and him my dad actually died in January. And he had put on. He was heavier than i'd ever seen him in his life and. He died a coven and because he was. He couldn't recover like you're supposed to. shoddy work. You know, sugar."

527.0,Provider,"Okay okay. yeah so as far as if you walk me through a day of meals, like a typical day of meals and food intake what would. What would that look like like. let's do. It. will do like the last 24 hours. Like what what."
14472.0,Patient,"To make it easy. Yesterday I don't remember I need to start keeping a lot, because I thought about doing that, just so they'd be able to tell you that kind of thing."

I don't even remember. it's almost like I have to look at the food in there to know what I had I had I had. To. Nice delicious tortillas that I put in a pan and I put some couple three for about four slices of cheese, because these were I took two tortillas and then you know, put the cheese have won shorty on top of another, so you don't have a small. city and then I sliced couple of. Like, what do you call them the red. bell peppers red peppers. chop those. slices slice them like thin strips and then I. put that into it, and so I just had like a case study I basically. Have the rest of the day, I had a few handfuls of like when I feel my stomach hungry or fill my head light or whatever or take my blood sugar and it's a little too loud us in the 70s, I go Okay, I have a handful of something missy or your toast. Okay, so because I get real low energy and I just can't do anything i'm just exhausted, and I know that's why that's one of the reasons anyway. um, and so I have like handfuls of whatever you know I keep I keep like right here, I have a bunch of pistachios and then I threw in some reason or a chop up like dates."
527.0,Provider,Okay.
14472.0,Patient,"Dates hustling date i've had honey and. throw a Punch in here for you. Anyway, so you know, and I can tell and pictures that i'm thinner than I was before that's, the only way I can tell. I can't in the mirror. That doesn't work, not for over 40 years hasn't worked. yeah I wish I could see a true picture, and I only I can do that is by taking a picture and then looking at it. You can't sit here you just don't see what other people see."
527.0,Provider,Sure yeah definitely.
14472.0,Patient,We get to suggest that when I think that that would solve about a quarter of the problem. yeah you don't have a realistic view sucks.

14472.0,Patient,"And by the way, a lot of just regular I went to one on one for that two years I was in I was a high interest once a day. Okay, five days a week, and it was so I mentor a lot of shares self examining and you know. You try to figure out what that person has this is issues. You know and it's hard to learn to examine every little thing you come across and they require, where you automatically do it."
527.0,Provider,"So what do you understand about your diagnosis, at this point, Melissa like. You know what your current diagnosis and what you're being treated for and. understand it."
14472.0,Patient,"I think I have. I get panic attacks I get. I get that leaves. kind of. i'll say leads to, but I think it's like fuel fuel and fire. Panic attacks and that, just like knots up my stomach and kind of gives me a reason not to eat like a true reason I just like I can't keep anything down. So you know I try to. not allow that to happen, because I have enough problems just getting it down I don't need you know. arguments that people that make it so that it's your stomach wants to make it come back at. me. um I don't know I don't know if that's like lack of digestive enzymes that could be part of it, and part of its just nervousness. So I don't know you know it's like kind of."

OK, I walk myself, through them, you know, if anything, make myself go watch something try to focus on something besides what led me to that panic attack and. Also, you know examine first you know you do deep breathing and then you go well what what caused me to get there, what am I supposed to do differently to help with that not happen it's not always that simple never. sure."
527.0,Provider,Pretty early yeah any history of like diet pills or laxative abuse or.
