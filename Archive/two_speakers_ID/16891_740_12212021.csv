You currently work from home, but you find it difficult to do your job lately, some of your physical activities include yoga almost every day and walking for 30 minutes let's stand by right."
16891.0,Patient,yep.
740.0,Provider,"Good deal so i'm going to actually some more questions if that's okay like I said, have any questions that I actually don't have comfortable just let me know okay so growing up what was your family life, like."
16891.0,Patient,"My I mean, I think it was pretty okay my parents good. We live in minneapolis I went to school my parents it wasn't like crazy volatiles but there's definitely constant screaming for a long time and then. They did get divorced, and then. My dad lived very close, so I saw him a lot and then he moved really far away, and then we moved very suddenly. So it was like a few things that but, for the most part, I think it was like relatively stable. And like I have good relationships with both my parents and my brother and my you know even my parents so for the most part, it was Okay, there are definitely a few tumultuous times, but ones that I don't think are super unique you know. For the most everything was okay."
740.0,Provider,"Okay, and how many siblings do you have."
16891.0,Patient,"I have one brother and then a one step sister who have known you know, since I was like 11."
740.0,Provider,mm hmm. And you kind of have a relationship with them.
16891.0,Patient,"yeah I have pretty good relationships, I think, with both of them. yeah."
740.0,Provider,And so i'm sorry Alexis. I didn't want you to know baby in the.
16891.0,Patient,No worries no worries.
740.0,Provider,i'm sorry gotta got a whole six month okay.
16891.0,Patient,"Oh, my God congratulations that's okay."
740.0,Provider,yeah i'm Alexis going don't me we just got started baking the cake. Even have their own room even other but he's so loud.
16891.0,Patient,yeah i'm sure he is.
740.0,Provider,"Anyway, I apologize for that. um so with your with your parents do you have relationship, do you still have a good relationship with them. yep and mom and dad are where they together or."
16891.0,Patient,"No, so they got divorced, when I was like I don't know nine ish."
740.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16891.0,Patient,So yeah.
740.0,Provider,"Okay, so any the anyone in the home ever struggle with mental health substance abuse eating disorders growing up."
16891.0,Patient,"Did you win mistake, I think, like, I have come by my like depression, anxiety pretty honestly, because I do think there's some. Probably on both sides, I think, on my mom's side my grandma and my aunt have pretty serious anxiety I think my dad has some on managed. anxiety, or maybe even like could my dad be a little bipolar perhaps or something along lines where he's like. super manic a little bit and then like depressing man he, like anyways, though, and my grandma you know was on, you know as definitely has a long history of depression on that side, so I do think I have it a little bit on both sides, you know um. But we also are like not I don't think particularly good communicators, so I think, maybe that compounded to me because, like, I was first diagnosed with depression, when I was like 11 or 12."
740.0,Provider,um.
16891.0,Patient,"You know, so this is like, not a new thing, but I just like. I don't think we talked about it much. Which is fine, but it's definitely like something as an adult i've had, which is why I go through these periods, where maybe not why but it's definitely like. I just need to stay on this damn medication and continue to do therapy and then I just like get lazy about it, and then I just feel completely out of control and feel like absolute garbage."
740.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16891.0,Patient,"So anyway, but yes, I do think there's definitely some on both sides for sure I mean there is stephanie. But no, you know major you know I what I call like I don't know not anything debilitating like everyone was gainfully employed and stuff like in that way, but but yeah."
740.0,Provider,"And um you mentioned your inconsistency with their European your medicine. yeah and is there. Is there a reason why you feel like you, you do on and off or you, you have good days, and then you get lazy and then it goes by like is there a reason."
16891.0,Patient,"Because there's I think two things number one is that whatever I tried a bunch of stuff when I was kind of younger or like me man, and I was like in my early 20s. and end up being like okay so left probably is the best for me, but it makes me honestly so tired that I think I take it, I take it, and then I changed jobs and so inevitably my insurance changes and. I just go off of it because i'm like maybe i'll be fine and then but also like genuinely hate talking to doctors like I gives me so much anxiety and stress and like. I feel, like every time I have to go to New therapist I have to like explain all the like there's like some to matt like I just hate talking about this so much, let me see so stress and so like I don't do it, you know I mean. um but but anyway, so I think it's like late i'm lazy I think I like get it just like kazmi really like a lot of anxiety and stress and then I also like the medication i've been on has been i'm just traditionally made me pretty tired and sluggish and and um yeah anyway."
740.0,Provider,"So one thing I will say this understanding can be really difficult repeating yourself over and over and over again, and you know, in the crazy part about it is of course it doesn't add to them, it doesn't take away from the anxiety, so the anxiety makes you more anxious. um and I can understand it, I think one of the main things is this Alexis, and this is something I will tell you. My thing, this is a sometimes and we do families and i've told the class before there's sometimes we feel like okay well i'm our capital under control medicine i'm doing good my counselor so i'm good. And then, and then we stopped doing what we're supposed to do, and then we realize. And, and you know what I really feel like it comes from the desire to not have to have medicine. Like I now feel like I want to be strong enough to do this on my own. And that's a good desire right and it doesn't mean that in the long haul you all. And I you know it, it doesn't mean that you're not going to be doing on your own it's just there right now. You in order for you to be able to do it on your own in the long haul you have to be able to get on a consistent Regiment now. Right, and so I mean I hope. i'll be your therapist so you found a girl. But you know. It is tough and just know. That I do empathize with you and I hear you right. And that's just it's just one of the things I hope that we can be that consistent place for you, so that we can get you back regulated so that we can get you back on a good ground and on a good foot and. But I do want to let you know I know that this is it. is very. Tough. And it does add to your anxiety and I see that and I, and I want you to know that I do acknowledge that and I do appreciate you being willing to just ask for help. One more time. Absolutely. So. um how was school as a kid growing up our school."
16891.0,Patient,"um I mean, I think I. was always a good, very good student. So I liked school I didn't really struggling in school night definitely had friends, I feel like it was pretty normals I didn't it wasn't typically you know bullied or anything like you know I think I had like a relatively smooth school experience. My I thought I was going one place for school and then for high school when I left eighth grade to high school and then. My mom got engaged and I was with my dad that summer, and so they didn't tell me that she'd gotten engaged and then she So when I got back from seeing my dad for the summer in California. I got back to Minnesota it was like okay we're moving to iowa in two weeks, and it was like I still feel like that is like I don't think they would have done it again this way, but it was so. So the I guess the first couple years of high school were very hard and I so honestly feel like it changed the trajectory of my life in a way that took me a long time to like right side from. So it was like that was like. Definitely, the second time that I was like after being kind of diagnosed with having kind of depression as a very young kid and then, once I got to high school again. Again i'd gone off, I was on maybe a little medic I don't remember if I was on, but I was definitely like that's when they really began that like medication journey was around that like high school. But you know it didn't seem to affect my grades, and I was, but I definitely had like for sure I can now look back and be like oh i'm so anxious I just like. was so worried about grades, and like getting straight a's was so unbelievable and like getting things done, and doing everything off was super so I can definitely look back and see like that was not super well managed anxiety, but or something but. You know, bordering on maybe a little obsessive about stuff but you know, otherwise, for the most part, it was fine. It was it doesn't I don't like I don't know anyway, it was it was mostly fine."
740.0,Provider,"How far did you complete in regards to education period, how did you go."
16891.0,Patient,I have a master's.
740.0,Provider,"Oh, so you."

740.0,Provider,And what do you do for a living now.
16891.0,Patient,"I work I work in marketing for kind of tech companies very, very Bay area I live in the Bay area very kind of like Barry a demand generation marketing for tech companies so. Which is why i'm still remote, are we have just never we just haven't gone back, yet in our offices and close so."
740.0,Provider,"Good. yeah i'm. Good. gosh. Sorry, my question slipped my mind. i'm there anything ever stand out to you. growing up like your neighborhood amongst your friends family than anything ever stand stand out to you."
16891.0,Patient,What do you mean in what way.
740.0,Provider,Like events like it could be good or bad like something that you always hold on to something that was near and dear or something it was tragic or.
16891.0,Patient,"From my like from my childhood you're saying I. mean there's definitely like again this like moving really quickly and not going to the high school, I thought I was going to stands out to me. was being again not great thing. My dad used to for a long time, he was just like really aggressive in like Houston hit us wouldn't me my brother my little bit like. he's like not it was like a period of time and I managed and it was because you maybe they're getting divorced, and he lost his business and stuff, and that is unfortunate memory that I feel like I think about a lot. But I mean we had some I i've been on some memorable I have been on one or two kind of memorable vacations. That I was you know, think about. I don't know and dream about my like childhood home all the time. Like just it's not even childhood it's just like stuff happens in the setting childhood home, so that, like first home that I lived in was clearly had some sort of impression upon me, so I do think about my old House a lot. And I moved out of that 20 you know 20 years ago. 21 years ago, maybe so for some reason it's definitely very stuck with me but. yeah I don't know if that's what you were talking about."
740.0,Provider,"yeah that's good. um, so this is currently do you have any financial any legal issues that you're concerned about. Good are you in relationship well nevermind. This regard honey mom mommy brain just slip there, and that was a mistake. i'm sorry. Okay, do you have any children. No okay good so. You tell me what are some things you want to work on, while you're in treatment with me."
16891.0,Patient,"I i'm just like. I like just want to be managed, though, because, like when I have like anxiety attacks or panic attacks or I have like. Occasionally, when things get really bad will have this like these, like flashbacks that I like can't wake up from. Or, like, I just want, I do not want that I want to be i'm just like super open I feel like i'm like pretty lucky in my life like I don't have any financial worries I don't have a bunch of kids like at home, I don't have like i'm sad about my relationship, but like. i'm on a freedom that most people on this planet, do not have like a job, but like I just feel like absolute shit all the time. And then i'm just like super overwhelmed by. need to like go outside places where i'm very comfortable, so I think I get like i've just like stay at home, like I just at home, all the time and I just don't want to be with other people. I was like. diagnosed with ptsd after was like raped. um it's like assaulted or whatever, and so, like, I do think about that a lot and just like don't want that to be constantly at the forefront of my mind especially know that I have to like I guess start dating again that sounds so horrible to me. Like I feel like I must have i've never been diagnosed they feel like I have there's no way I don't have some sort of eating disorders, I just feel like i'm so not in control around food and no matter what I do many things I try i'm just like super overwhelmed. But food and late."
740.0,Provider,Sunday you bet you means he.
16891.0,Patient,"Yes, definitely like I just like it's not even that I like. Binge eat in a way that I think that, but I do like for sure, but I also like there's so many foods you just feel so horrible and I just like can't i'm just like such a hedonist I guess when it comes to like food and restaurants that i'm like. i'm just like this is bad for me and I don't feel good and I don't feel healthy and like really want to do that I want. anyway. yeah I just like genuinely don't think I like myself very much though it would like to change that I like. don't think i'm particularly himself as self esteem."
