706.0,Provider,Good morning. How are you.
15924.0,Patient,"i'm Okay, how are you."
706.0,Provider,"Good good so um. It is nine o'clock your time, so what time do you go to work."
15924.0,Patient,"um I work from home, so I work. yeah yeah."
706.0,Provider,Okay okay.
15924.0,Patient,"Well, I wouldn't my God, so I work from home."
706.0,Provider,"So typically when people pick the early morning appointments is because they go to work like you know, right after that so that's why I was wondering so yeah tell me about how things have been going for ya."
15924.0,Patient,they've been getting better.
706.0,Provider,Okay that's good that's good.
15924.0,Patient,"I mean me and my ex. talked out our problems, and it seems to shine light on. What will we both actually needed and want so."
706.0,Provider,Okay that's good.
15924.0,Patient,yeah.
706.0,Provider,"that's good and it's really important that you have you know a good support. You know when you're working through trying to you know get into recovery, you know, because with your drinking being as frequent and as heavy as it was. yeah and what triggers being a relationship you definitely want to make sure that there's some stabilization there so you're not triggered to you know continue that kind of behavior."
15924.0,Patient,From.
706.0,Provider,"You know, because obviously through therapy you're going to learn coping skills and tools, but just avoiding those situations is obviously the best thing you know to be preventive epic ass. So um does he drink or anything like that."
15924.0,Patient,It is not drink um he is actually 10 years clean of. Drug use.
706.0,Provider,"Okay, so he also is in recovery, so he he knows what's that like especially like in the beginning, knowing how not only you know the. how hard it is when you have cravings but also the change that people make because you are a different person than when you were using, whether it be alcohol marijuana any other drug than where you are when you're sober so how you process things differently. is different, how you. relate to him, will be different. Your needs are going to be different, because when you're under the influence, most of the time those things don't really take priority in your life. right because you're just intoxicated and an intoxicated states up it's a happy place to be so you don't worry about all of the things beneath that, like the trauma. The you know issues in the relationship, the stress of everyday life, you know all of those things take a backseat to the during game. yeah so so, but he knows that when people stop using that they change because he's been there, so hopefully that will be a benefit to your relationship to have somebody that knows what that's like. So. Has he been supportive so far of you're not drinking."
15924.0,Patient,He has he actually. wanted me to stop drinking forever ago. Part of our problem.
706.0,Provider,"hmm I was gonna say is that what kind of added to alcohol. Even though it's legal I feel like that is the one that's the hardest one to cope with because it is legal. And like. Everywhere you go there's alcohol, like everything all the fun activities that the society has happened, you know live music and outdoor events and all of these festivals, and all of that. It stems typically around drinking, I was like oh let's go have drinks, you know let's go party it up you typically don't see those like a dry event like okay we're having a concert, but no alcohol is being served. To go, you know what I mean so that's why alcohol is the hardest one, so you can say. You know, you need to stop you need to stop you need to stop, but every corner is a bar and you know every commercial is a drinking commercial and every event that you go to is always alcohol being served that's challenging. yeah you know when he quit whatever drug it was that he was doing you don't go, you know into a grocery store and see it sending there on the shelf right. You know what that mean you know, like it's very, very different. So your your struggles going to look a little different because you can't avoid necessarily the environments that there's alcohol because they're kind of everywhere."
15924.0,Patient,"And now, he when we go on dates he's always tried to when I like try to quit before. he's like are you going to be okay going into a restaurant with alcohol or do you want to go to like we went to this like mom and pop type of thing to where they didn't have alcohol."
706.0,Provider,mm hmm.
15924.0,Patient,"No, it wasn't there for me to attempt to get."
706.0,Provider,uh huh.
15924.0,Patient,"yeah and I did. That whole you know, like."
706.0,Provider,"yeah so you don't have that trigger you know you know, maybe i've been trigger you at that moment, because with him sitting there you're like. Oh, I probably shouldn't drink, but it triggers your brain and say like Oh, but when I go home i'm going to want to drink so i'm gonna have to figure out a way that I can drink. And then you fall into some some sometimes that may be in your case I don't know, but sometimes you fall into that line to see like. You you know hide it, you know, like drink without people knowing because you feel triggered and you need that at least in your brain you think you need that. But you don't do it up front like right in front of somebody yeah because you know what you're doing is not right, you just don't have enough control over it to say Okay, I need to you know, whatever i'm trying to deal with right now I need to do that without alcohol. So um. So, have you ever done like a haze or anything like that have you ever gone to meetings."
15924.0,Patient,I went been to one.
706.0,Provider,What did you think.
15924.0,Patient,I don't I don't know. It was a literacy one and i'm. i'm not a reader out loud type of person. So it was a little different but.
706.0,Provider,we're reading out loud.
15924.0,Patient,yeah they're reading from the book.
706.0,Provider,"Of the big book. yeah that's a really good book, I have a copy of that book it's like a woman's blue it's the alcohol anonymous the Blue Book. yeah um it's actually a really good book there's a lot of really good information in there, it talks about the history of alcohol anonymous how it came to be all that. But there's like different sections in there, which is really cool because they have like. kind of like it's almost like a letter a letter to your kids a letter to your spouse or your partner, a letter to. You know, and it basically just explains, from the perspective of somebody who has an alcohol use disorder, you know what it is that they're going through what what it is that they have now put these people through what it is that they need it's actually a really good book. But if you're not a person who can read it out loud in a group I recommend just reading it just getting it yourself and reading it. yeah um there's a lot of different age groups out there. they're not all the same. yeah just like you know every group that we haven't bh he isn't the same if you go to one that has one therapist and you go to one that has another therapist you're going to see distinct differences and how they run their group and. I run my groups more on like kind of like. A free basis, so I facilitate it, but I let the actual people in the group basically decide what they're going to talk about and then have them support each other, because I find that advice from somebody who's been there as good as far more valuable than mine from a clinical perspective. Right, you know so that's how I run my groups but everybody everybody runs there's differently. And with a typically you have an a member that runs the group and so whatever worked for them in the past is typically how they run their group. Good things about a is around people that are struggling with the same thing. They hold you accountable, they also celebrate your successes, you know, like 30 days clean 90 days clean. And they also provide you with maybe a support like. A sponsor so when you do feel those triggers you have somebody that you can call and talk out talk it out with them, you know so that you don't go and have that drink yeah. A lot of people with an alcohol use disorder will get right to the point of literally staring at a drink and just sitting there staring at it for like an hour. And maybe they drink it maybe they don't, but a lot of times they just stare at it like it's a war like who's gonna win this this war, you know may just stare at it and stare at it. And that's those those are the people that are further along in their recovery because typically. In the beginning, if you've got a drink sitting in front of you and something's really upsetting you you're going to drink it further down the road when you've been in recovery, while, then it says battle of wills like who's gonna win um. And so, sometimes it's just good when you're in that kind of a place that you have somebody that you can call. That can come and be like hey that's great that you didn't drink that you know let's push let's put that away let's talk about what's really the issue, because the issue isn't the alcohol. Right it's everything else, and I think we talked about, you have a lot of trauma throughout your years you've had relationships you've had a lot of things happen to you that it's just easier to black it out. You know it's just easier to forget that it happens, and the best way to do that is to distort reality and a chemical will do that, whether it be alcohol marijuana whatever drug of choice, whatever it is. it's going to distort that because that's what drugs do they give you that drugs and alcohol give you that immediate gratification so you use it and you don't have to wait a day or two or a week or. Whatever for things to get better. They get better right away. And so that's that's the draw because if you go to therapy you don't go to therapy one time, and the next day you're cured and you're like Oh, I feel great life is awesome it takes a lot of time and a lot of work. it's the right way to do it, but it's not the immediate gratification whereas if you are sad or upset or having flashbacks of something traumatic. You drink enough, and the more you drink you're like Oh well, that doesn't seem so bad anymore, you know and so it's basically changing the way that you think. So immediate gratification it gets rid of that, but when you sober up it comes flooding back and sometimes even worse because now you feel crappy too, because you drink because you're hungover because maybe you, you know didn't do something that you want to you're supposed to do. Because you're you know not feeling well or you're feeling depressed because alcohol is a depressant so obviously when you are done using it you're going to fall into that depression know low energy don't want to do much. I don't know if you experienced that after drinking but that's typical response to after."
15924.0,Patient,"yeah there's days, where I wake up and i'm like what did I post on Facebook and i'm like delete delete. or sure. hmm the whole world already seen it I. yeah I need to not have my phone when I was drinking."
706.0,Provider,"uh huh like the whole like the whole eight guilt and shame. thing like because you don't. You don't you have no inhibitions. Nine whatever you posted you thought, this is a good thing to post, you have no inhibitions you have no filter. yeah and you're the influence you know and no inhibitions that's why people when they drink a lot, the people that you get angry when they drink they fight because there's no inhibitions. And they just have this they have little impulse control, and so you don't fight, but you post add things on Facebook or things that you're like oh I should not have said that. you'll find people will like air their dirty laundry so they'll get really intoxicated over some event that's happened and then they'll just spew it on Facebook, so now everybody knows your business. yeah I didn't really want to do that."
15924.0,Patient,yeah you know.
706.0,Provider,"Especially if you've got co workers on there, or you know. Family that maybe is a little bit more judgmental. Because, then you have to explain. plate, you know who wants to explain something that's happening in your personal life that's causing you that much grief, you know, nobody wants to get raked over the coals about that you know be put in the hot seat. because all that does is make you want to drink more because. The easiest way to get rid of it. So um. So yeah so I mean it's just it's just this way of thinking, how you've been dealing with all of the stress and the anxiety and the trauma that you've experienced. What you were doing before was drinking. And it hasn't been working out so now it's time to change that way of thinking. Because, for you, especially with as much as you drank the day that you dig it your Oh, why are we call them oh wi here, but I think there you're like a dui."
15924.0,Patient,"Well, was a dui their changes to oh VI in April."
706.0,Provider,"Okay, so what's the difference."
15924.0,Patient,There is no difference. A dui was driving under the influence. and open guy is operating vehicle.
706.0,Provider,"Okay, so I don't understand the difference between."
15924.0,Patient,The two of them there's not.
706.0,Provider,"And so we we call it an old wi operating operating while intoxicated here in iowa so that's just weird anyways they just put a bunch of letters and they call it, they call it, but i'm like the good thing is you didn't hit somebody in hurt them. hurt yourself I you know there's so there's so many worst case scenarios. Especially when you're that intoxicated typically when you're intoxicated. you're like I probably shouldn't drive but i'm probably okay to get home right that's always the thing you tell yourself yeah. I probably shouldn't drive you know, this is probably not safe i've been drinking a long time, but I can probably get home it's not that far. You know, but then you know you have this really slow reaction time because you're intoxicated so you know if i'm. A van have a family in a van pulls out in front of you can you hit the brakes on time to not hit them probably not because you have that reaction time that's like three to five seconds delayed. uh huh so I mean that's The good thing that's a good thing that it was just a charge, you know it's something you have to."
15924.0,Patient,go through.
706.0,Provider,But it's also a wake up call and the wake up call could have been far more traumatic than just getting pulled over and getting a charge from the police.
15924.0,Patient,yeah.
706.0,Provider,"You know, so in that respect, you know. What happened is. Even though very expensive. is a very good reason to make changes. So let's talk about so your alcohol consumption, we talked about that the last time I guess My first question to you is, will you be able to stop completely, are you going to try and moderate your drinking."
15924.0,Patient,So I tried to moderate it um but I took an oath myself as of December 1 I haven't had a drink. Okay okay so i'm less stays it now.
706.0,Provider,And how do you feel.
15924.0,Patient,"I mean, I feel fine honestly I I feel more hungry, because I really didn't eat that replaced it, you know i'll go replace my eating. you'll add. Sugar yeah I did have like a headache the past two days but i've also worked two doubles the same time."
706.0,Provider,"Okay. I have my. floor over there just a second i'm going to grab it. sorry about that I heard it and I got it buzzing i'm like we're in a. Good place for it. So, but physically you feel good."
15924.0,Patient,yeah.
706.0,Provider,"Okay okay that's good you don't do you feel like you had any physical withdrawal symptoms, when you stopped completely."
15924.0,Patient,I don't know if that could have been my headaches that will never go away the past two days could have been I don't know.
706.0,Provider,It could have been.
15924.0,Patient,I mean. I think I took ibuprofen twice a day yesterday and Saturday and it's noted stop it.
706.0,Provider,"yeah so sometimes depends on the person, but alcohol withdrawal is different, everybody extreme alcohol withdrawal is the same, you have seizures delirium tremens when like you have some really significant things. Where you need to be medically supervised when you come off alcohol because you've drank so much for so long. um alcohol withdrawal is the only withdraw that can actually kill you because it messes with your blood pressure. yeah It could also be because, if your blood pressure is too high or too low, you can get headaches, too, so it could have been a little bit of that, but you just didn't have the extreme case of you are having delirium trams, or like tremors or seizures those kinds of things. But it definitely could have been do you feel like you've gotten better at the more days of the past."
15924.0,Patient,yeah like today i'm good. i'll try but it's only you know what 930.
706.0,Provider,"yeah yeah. So your body, also be could believe it or not be going through sugar withdraw because alcohol. So."
15924.0,Patient,yeah.
706.0,Provider,"it's kind of like caffeine, if you just stop caffeine cold Turkey typically you get a headache if you've been drinking it all the time."
15924.0,Patient,yeah.
706.0,Provider,"Well, you know I drink like one cup of coffee a day. And if I don't get that cup of coffee mid afternoon i'll get a headache and that's just one, so people that drink it like all day every day. And then they they quit cold Turkey they're going to have a reaction to that typically their headaches yeah sugar can be the same way, because typically people that stop drinking start craving sugar candies and all of this kind of stuff because they're trying to replenish that sugar."
15924.0,Patient,"yeah cuz I noticed like when I was drinking, I never really eat sweet."
706.0,Provider,uh huh.
15924.0,Patient,Right almost rarely. y'all have sweets.
706.0,Provider,"yeah when when you're when you're drinking and, depending on what you're having typically sleeps don't go with alcohol. Unless you're having like. Wine or something you know but beer liquor they don't typically mix with a brownie."
15924.0,Patient,or a piece.
706.0,Provider,"or a cookie. You know you're thinking greasy food typically people think of drinking and greasy food bar food wing stuff like that those are the things that you're going to eat when you're drinking, you know they don't serve chocolate cake at the bar because nobody's going to get it. You know, like, I will take a Bush slide and and a piece of chocolate cake you're not going to hear that, at a bar you just know. So um so I mean that makes sense that makes sense i'm The one thing that I can say, well, hope that that because a lot of people are like oh my gosh i'm going to gain so much weight I quit drinking kind of like smoking. Did you replace. You have to replace like oh my gosh and I gained so much weight eat fruit because fruit is very high in sugar, but it's natural sugar so you're going to burn it faster. Because isn't it doesn't have to break down in your body so like apples things like that something that gives you that craving you know satisfies that craving that sweet craving grapes apples really sweet fruit."
15924.0,Patient,berries.
706.0,Provider,"strawberries get those all of those will help because you get that immediate sugar. yeah that you would get if you ate a chocolate bar but it's not going to wreak havoc on your weight like a chocolate bar three times a day well. So I mean that's the best the best option, and then you know also when you feel cravings rather than reach for sugar, replacing it with some type of coping skill to get your mind off of it um. You can you know some things that have worked for some of my patients is like journaling like journaling how they're feeling that day getting it out on papers gets it out of your head sometimes just doing that. redirects those thoughts of Oh, I need to have sugar or, even worse, I need to have a drink. that's a good one, also music is good music doesn't trigger you some people music triggers because a lot of their fun times are attached to songs so you. have to. figure out, you know if that's you."
15924.0,Patient,there's also traumas attached songs to.
706.0,Provider,"Exactly so just. Make sure that whatever you're listening to put you in a calming place so you might want to make a playlist because you can't control the radio. Right, you know you have your circles of control what you can control what other people, control and when nobody controls and. The things that you can control, you want to control as much as you can to stay, stable and consistent in your life so if music is something that you enjoy. Then, making a playlist of songs that put you in a good state of mind that have happy memories attached, not necessarily party memories, but just happy memories. songs that remind you of your kids or you know things like that things that are going to uplift you rather than make you depressed or make you want to go party. that's a good one pets are really good therapy I don't know if you have pets, but one of the big things that people do is like go walk their dog, because if you're out of the House typically you're not going to walk by a stand that they're serving alcohol at you know. yeah what a lemonade stand but typically you're not going to see you know, a stand for an alcoholic beverage yeah. You know so and there's just different things, and you just have to figure out what works for you, you know, some people decide they're going to take up exercising. So then they'll start like zoom the class or go to a gym or go for a walk or you know, whatever is yeah. You know, so you just have to figure out the things that work for you as a person, and then, when you feel that that little voice in your head be like Oh, I need to drink Those are the things you want to go to and redirect your attention to something else. The more you do that, the more second nature, it will become your your mind will automatically do that, that when it says Oh, I need a drink of public nope i'm going to go do this. Rather than now, when you're feeling upset about something your brain says Oh, I want to drink and it just keep saying over and over I want to drink, I want to drink, I want to drink and now you're literally fighting with yourself to not take that drink. So you have to change those pathways of your brain. it's hard it's really hard and i'm not going to tell you that it's easy, it will get easier, but right now it's going to be challenging and that's why so important to be in a supportive environment. yeah so um we are out of time for today, did you have any questions or comments concerns anything."
15924.0,Patient,So um my probation probation officer said he hasn't received anything about our calls.
706.0,Provider,"Okay, so I sent one last week because that's the first time I saw you so he would have gotten one for last week, and it should be there. Because that's the first time I saw you so. And I felt that weekly."
15924.0,Patient,"He texted me on Friday. Okay, he hasn't received anything."
706.0,Provider,Okay.
15924.0,Patient,"Well, let me double check."
706.0,Provider,"It out but. I did all of those last week, let me pull it up here. We don't want you getting in trouble that's for."
15924.0,Patient,"I know I to accept some back I said why see them Monday, Tuesday, so I will see what happens."
706.0,Provider,yeah means i'll check care. So when I do these then they go to our social worker and then the social worker typically sends them out so i'm. double check. how's group going for you.
15924.0,Patient,"feel like. They got more problems than I do i'm like when they're talking about their triggers and their stuff like. That like I. don't relate, but I kind of do relate ish. um i'm not saying that their problems are more worse than mine but it just was like. I don't know that addiction part of the drug side, so I can't really relate, and all of them. Are addiction on the drug side so i'm just like. Oh, I don't really. Have those triggers like that."
706.0,Provider,mm hmm.
15924.0,Patient,But it's still eye opening of how they're coping or you know how they. get through it so it's still that still the same honestly. But it was just different for me and so.
706.0,Provider,how's your depression.
15924.0,Patient,"it's gotten. See, I think it was really just really depression, I think it's just more or less. The event that i'm going through at the time, but it could be depression, at the same time."
706.0,Provider,Okay somewhere situational and I know we talked about before to anxiety irritability racing thoughts all of that house.
15924.0,Patient,um I mean I really haven't had. Much of that.
706.0,Provider,And then kind of those feeling really faint dizzy.
15924.0,Patient,I haven't had none of those and a half and along minute so I probably months yeah.
706.0,Provider,that's good.
15924.0,Patient,"Then again, like this week I also or last week I also worked Wednesday Friday Saturday Sunday."
706.0,Provider,So.
15924.0,Patient,yeah yeah So when I that's why I have so many jobs because that keeps me busy.
706.0,Provider,uh huh okay.
15924.0,Patient,Working on my away.
706.0,Provider,"Okay okay. So um are you seeing you said you're seeing is it Dr sal. yeah okay so definitely have a conversation with her even about your kind of mood and things like that, like I said before she can help you. To potentially take something that can help you with that anxiety depression, a lot of medications have that dual purpose, where they work as kind of an antidepressant, but they also have. properties that help with the anxiety. And you like, I said new might feel oh it's just situational but then you get on a medication and you're like oh wow like I feel a lot better. You know a lot of times that's what's reported is I didn't realize how not great, I felt until I took something to level out the chemicals in my brain and now I feel much better I have more energy, I have a better outlook those types of things."
15924.0,Patient,yeah i've never been a.
706.0,Provider,Tell based type of person mm hmm.
15924.0,Patient,"To help with the only thing i've ever done, you know was alcohol. Because I i'm even I was always scared to take anything."
706.0,Provider,"mm hmm yeah I know that's what you had said, and I mean it's not necessarily something that you have to do, but a conversation when would be able to she'd be able to tell you, if that's something that you need. well. And she's not one that's like a pill pusher I guess she would say I mean she's gonna you know you, for the most part, will direct how your treatment looks so. um and I will tell you that I sent three progress reports and so far, because I must have gotten some kind of notification that said hey do these progress reports. So even if I hadn't seen you so like the very first one, I hadn't seen you yet so I just kind of was like hey i'm not able to assess it this week and then there was another one son on December 1. And that would have been for the week prior to that because that's when you did your bps and then there was a one sent on December 3 which is Friday, it looks like at 732 so there should be three progress reports that your probation officers should have received so far. Okay, so if, for some reason, that is not the case, get a hold of the vc and they will send an inquiry out to find out where those are. Okay. Did you have any other questions."
15924.0,Patient,I don't believe so.
706.0,Provider,"All right, well, you take care, and I will see when a couple of weeks. Okay, all right bye bye."
