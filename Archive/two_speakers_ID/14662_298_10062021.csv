298.0,Provider,hi Eric. How are you.
14662.0,Patient,"i'm doing good, how are you good good."
298.0,Provider,"Did you do the research, I told you to do."
14662.0,Patient,um. No. Okay we're gonna look. Lately forgotten about. any mention of research so.
298.0,Provider,"um well, I had asked you to look up lamictal Cindy ox and study. neuro chemicals of the brain. Know small stuff they're pretty big."
14662.0,Patient,"yeah okay. Well, I did not, unfortunately, I. missed the boat on that one so."
298.0,Provider,that's all right tell me tell me what is your mood been like.
14662.0,Patient,"um let's see I started with the increased dosage on the bupropion on September 27 so about a week ago and. My I felt a kind of an increase in pet you know my energy levels, a little bit higher. But i've noticed my mood swings have gotten stronger in both directions, you know, I was previously kind of sailing along at a. Always depressed but at a very. consistent."
298.0,Provider,level uh huh.
14662.0,Patient,"um, and now it seems like I i'm feeling better some of the time, and then I get really, really depressed other times like."
298.0,Provider,"it's so This is so true they teach this they teach us this in school that we have to really watch our patients when we give them antidepressants because they have more energy and a little that they can carry out. Suicide when you start treating them for depression, because they have a little bit more energy and a little bit more that they just didn't have before so not that you're suicidal. Please don't think take it right back."
14662.0,Patient,I didn't take.
298.0,Provider,"it's just that, when you when i'm finally giving your brain a little bit of pick me up it's enough to really take you at the same time. it's that sounds so crazy to me here I am giving you a pickup but, yet it makes you feel worse."
14662.0,Patient,"yeah yeah. So. yeah there as crazy as it sounds, I kind of makes sense to me so. So is this it's kind of sounds like this is typical with."
298.0,Provider,it's not. That it's.
14662.0,Patient,Possible okay.
298.0,Provider,"it's possible and it's and you see this in people who have extreme depression we're talking major depression here, not a mild depression somebody who's had something go on that that depression, for a while. When they finally get on a medication that starts to bring them back up again that's when we see the mood swings happen."
14662.0,Patient,"Ah, OK."
298.0,Provider,"So the next question logical question is, you know how long is this going to last."
14662.0,Patient,"yeah it's just something that like kind of tapers off and spoon salad or, should I be considering a different medication, or you know what, what do you think."
298.0,Provider,"I just have the answer in my head as you were talking and then I got listening to you, it. was what do I think Okay, I know what I was going to say is you know i'm not a big fan of years and years and years on the same medication, I think that there needs to be trials. At coming down off medication and then going back on medication and the reason being is your brain heals it's it's um there's a lot of neural plasticity going on all the time, new pathways are getting built there's things happening that your brain is healing. So I say a year is a good time to do a trial if you're stable to come off of the medication, but you don't get to hit that year until you're stable at your medication for a year. And we're not there yet so we're not always going to be on medicine, but at the same time, I think you need it now let's talk about how long you've been on the different dosages did I go up or do anything for you or did that happen somewhere else."
14662.0,Patient,"No, that was elsewhere. Okay i've been on Prozac for. Oh, my God probably 23 years roughly. And my dosages on that have stepped up, I think the most I ever took was 80 milligrams a day and then right now step back down when I added the bupropion and I stepped back down to 40 milligrams of Prozac and added the 300 milligrams of bupropion."
298.0,Provider,How long have you been on the puppy on.
14662.0,Patient,um I think about two years.
298.0,Provider,Okay.
14662.0,Patient,"Maybe maybe three, I think it was 2018."
298.0,Provider,So this combination of the wellbutrin and the flow blocks team and you've been on it for quite a few years.
14662.0,Patient,"Yes, yeah."
298.0,Provider,"Okay, and the depression is still there you're still having mood swings. Would you like help with that."
14662.0,Patient,um. I mean yeah I want to. I want to do whatever it takes to snap myself out of this depressed cycle that have been in for several years now and um.
298.0,Provider,"it's called treatment resistant depression is what. I yeah so it's called treatment resistant depression my recommendation is a very low dose of an anti psychotic to break the resistance. I recommend zyprexa or a lot it's also called The Lancet team and we're talking 2.5 milligrams where we have people who are on 3040 milligrams i'm just wanting to give you enough to work with Prozac. to break some depression, if we had to go to five milligrams I think that's the top, we would ever go. The downside of this medicine, the good side is it's very strong and it works really well with Prozac and the two of them combined is. Like a designer medication called Cindy ox and I mentioned it before to you yeah. The downside of this medicine, when you get into if you gain weight on this, I would need to know, because then it wouldn't if you gain more than seven pounds, then I would need to know about it. Because it wouldn't be having said that, because we use it just for depression we're not using it for psychosis like people who have delusions and. hallucinations that's the higher doses that's what those doses are used for, but when I want to use it for depression, I use it at very small doses to augment the Prozac. Another side effect of this medication is the side effect of sleepiness so you have to take it at bedtime because people go to sleep with it."
14662.0,Patient,and
298.0,Provider,"It just knocks you out so that you're not tired, I again I don't know your doses just would be high enough for that, but that's what I tell people if you want to if we really want to treat this depression. And I don't think I want to give you any more energy. Because I don't want you to have mood swings the more energy half the more possibility because we've never treated the depression part not really adequately. Right So those are my thoughts, what are your thoughts."
14662.0,Patient,"um. I don't know I mean going on a new medication it it's scary because I don't know what it's gonna. be like, then, you know it's it's a kind of a bit of. A gamble I guess i'm."
298.0,Provider,"Now here's The good thing with this medicine is it's not like a anti depressant where you you don't have to wait four weeks to know. Like you're gonna know within a week. you're going to say oh Okay, I do think this is working or no I don't like this."
14662.0,Patient,Okay.
298.0,Provider,So if. we're not going to lose a lot of time if we try this.
14662.0,Patient,So would this be in addition to the bupropion and the Prozac or would be taken to be.
298.0,Provider,So the appropriate on treats dopa mean. that's what is for motivation your get up and go your your energy levels that's what will be appropriate entries flow walk city teen it treats anxiety mood swings sadness. The zyprexa works really well with the flow walks a team to help with the moves to bring the moods back up that's that's what we'd be looking for that this meant to do.
14662.0,Patient,"Okay okay um. I also wanted to talk with you about the program overall, I have my first meeting with Andrea at the therapist and. I she she said that the group therapy. was like a non negotiable thing for the program and I really. was not."
298.0,Provider,Like.
14662.0,Patient,I was getting more depressed after each group therapy session that I was going into it so.
298.0,Provider,"I don't want to lose you, but I understand if you need to refer out I can't take that away. I can make it last but I can't take it away."
14662.0,Patient,"well. How much would less speak because I Andrea said that it could be lessened to like maybe once a month, but that wouldn't be for quite some time down the road like months down the road and."
298.0,Provider,"Say that. That that um so I. What if we make some sort of agreement at twice a month for one month and then i'll talk to her and get you down to one month, if you do two times in a month and do it for one month, then i'll bump you down to once a month."
14662.0,Patient,"Okay, I can I can look at that yeah."
298.0,Provider,"Okay, I am making a note right now that i've made this agreement with you, I can't take it off the table completely, but I can. Okay."
14662.0,Patient,"So basically two times in October and then one time in November once monthly after that. Okay. And i'm also. Seen another therapist outside of bright heart. And I want to make sure that there's no conflict with that there's no conflict building lies for my insurance it's fine, but I don't know about treatment program wise some."
298.0,Provider,Now there's.
14662.0,Patient,People have a strong opinion with me now okay. that's fine.
298.0,Provider,I don't. I don't have a strong opinion on that. All very good questions.
14662.0,Patient,Good.
298.0,Provider,how's your sleep.
14662.0,Patient,"Over the last week and a half it's been. More interrupted. I tend to be waking up. spontaneously, you know at three or five in the morning. And you know, then I go back to sleep and sometimes it takes me several hours to fall back to sleep. Sometimes i'm able to roll back, and you know 2030 minutes later i'm knocked out again. But it has been. It has been it has changed since I increase the bupropion."
298.0,Provider,Okay. That you notice that you're more awake.
14662.0,Patient,"i'm um. yeah, I guess, I mean I do notice that i'm happier in the mornings. i'm I tend to really have the opposite side of that like in the afternoon like around. Two or three o'clock and i'm ready for a nap."
298.0,Provider,way.
14662.0,Patient,"That, I guess, I should also add, I take the the extra 150 of bupropion I take that, at noon. And the Prozac and 300 milligrams of reprogrammed I take that in the morning around eight o'clock."
298.0,Provider,"Okay, love that needs to get that updated that would have been my recommendation to do the. Around noon."
14662.0,Patient,yeah I think that's why I decided to do it around noon on your. Okay.
298.0,Provider,"Good all right, I need to go any suicidal or homicidal thoughts."
14662.0,Patient,"No, no."
298.0,Provider,Any other questions for me.
14662.0,Patient,"um no so i'm not sure where that leaves us with the medication, or are you going to be writing in for."
298.0,Provider,I am i'm gonna get i'm gonna ask you to take a half of a tablet for the first week. So I want to add to that time take a half a tablet and. My concern is you're going to have to figure out when the right time is so that you don't wake up groggy like. i'm not sure when that will be maybe you'll need to take it at eight o'clock at night or.
14662.0,Patient,You know.
298.0,Provider,"i'm not sure you're gonna have to figure out the timing, so that you wake up pretty. ready to go for the next day. yeah Then again, some people may not even it doesn't even faze them as we're trying to break the depression."
