13205.0,Patient,"It was, it was very bad very, very, very, very, very bad I cannot even stress on that. And I don't know I think I don't know why my, it has to be something with a medication because i'm not I don't know. i'm. My combination, a long time, you know. It took like about three months. right for me to. Also i'm not sure i'm not sure what it is. i'm not sure, but. Because like i'm not doing. Like. It was not last night the night before. Now I understand I have trigger depressions."
705.0,Provider,uh huh.
13205.0,Patient,"Like something triggers me, I know that and i'm like Okay, you know i'm Okay, and then all of a sudden. Like the other night I was looking at the news, you know just just to just get my you know get look at something just scrolling over I saw her name, I was very familiar. I mean, I heard familiar I knew the name. uh huh but but anyway, it took me back like to my childhood. Because I knew the person, when we were children."
705.0,Provider,Okay.
13205.0,Patient,"And anyway, and then I looked up looked him up on Google and oh my God is so successful in there in Dubai. Because I lived in Dubai when I was a child."
705.0,Provider,mm hmm.
13205.0,Patient,"So, then, I was friend with his sister and looked at the sister. I saw my God how successful they are, of course, they were from a very rich family of from the beginning but. But anyway, but they're very successful my friend, the girl is an author now and she's. Like and we were in the same school and you know and then i'm thinking like that the trigger was like oh my God look at her. where she is you know she's accomplished so much in her life. And she's you know so. Active and everything and where, am I, so I was this this thing that you should people I know we shouldn't do and we shouldn't compare ourselves. But it was just like I felt very, very worthless were worthless. And that was a trigger and I was just crying I was really. Not doing so. So this is how things are happening now. Right this mostly. triggers."
705.0,Provider,"He right, but your knowing your triggers Now this is huge that now, you know that that is a trigger for you."
13205.0,Patient,"yeah I know because, as soon as I saw the things it's just on my email, I felt very, very, very bad. About myself and. Just just that word where they worthless like I didn't achieve anything I didn't do anything I just got married and have children now. And then I wasn't feeling well for now almost 20 years now i'm dealing with my Depression and anxiety. Often on often on. So anyway i'm just saying that. that's how things happen."
705.0,Provider,"mm hmm and acknowledging that you felt like you, you called it shallow when you said yeah that that it's a form of comparison, where you'll compare and then you take it in word. To where it then works on your self esteem so try, now that you know that you can be mindful that if that starts to creep in and let's say you find something out about someone is you know, sometimes even a different word like envious like if you're envious of them and what they."
13205.0,Patient,"Do yeah I mean. envious and there's not enough. yeah maybe yes yeah i'm envious but not in a thing like I don't want them to be you know I don't want them to. suffer, I mean I want them to do great, but I just want to be I wish I had done, you know something to. You know that's that my envious it's not called envious you know. You just want to. I even told my husband about it, but he kept saying like well. You know, maybe there's their life isn't you know they're the LIFE isn't they have all the money in the world, and they have this or that or that maybe inside they're not happy, or they have some problems. And I said I don't know that i'm not. I oh you don't know if they're happy, you said you don't know if they're happy I said I don't care about the happiness part I know nobody's really, really happy happy, you know. So dumb you become maybe happy or, but I just was talking about the achievement of sucks you know. Because I went to I got my degree in bachelor in business management. and afterwards I never pursued anything I just got my degree went back home and that time it was very hard. To get a job, back then, and I wasn't I think I was always like I can't. I was always. Maybe I was always like I can't do these jobs, you know i'm not able. I never saw myself as a person to be in an office, and you know working or. Doing or telling I don't know I just. never happened never happened."
705.0,Provider,"Achievement those you know Shamil is many different things, and for me when I hear that you got your bachelor's and you were able to complete that that's achievement. And all."
13205.0,Patient,"But you know. yeah cheap that. I was. When I was a kid that and I. have to do something more, you know I don't know I don't. I mean my I have my diploma wherever whatever it is it's in my closet somewhere. Right don't want to even look at it, but. People you know go to school, and then they go get a job, and then they get you know. promoted a little higher do something, you know my aren't actually the one she's like talk to she divorced her husband and then she had no nothing she knew nothing no English no but I mean she had no school degree nothing. But she. was hard in the bank in Dubai and should learn, you know she was she worked for a long many, many years and I always say she did it she didn't even have a school degree she's she's even finished sixth grade. So you know these things come to my mind and. yeah and I wanted to be honest with you, I would I wish I had. succeeded, and I was so I could. be able to. earn what is a self sufficient like take care of myself I didn't have people even my husband I don't want him to take care of yeah I don't like him spending money. You know I feel I wish I had that power that I would be able to contribute. To the household right. To my children."
705.0,Provider,"And i'm hearing Shamil you won't you, you wish that you could contribute more and do more things there's also to. Knowing that with getting your diploma that you did achieve that and there, there are many people that either too afraid to go to school. To go to college, a lot of people don't finish high school and so, if we look at different achievements you've achieved some things that maybe you know. A person doesn't even sign up for college they don't even graduate from high school or you have someone that starts college and they're not able to finish it that there's too much pressure and stress. And so you were able to accomplish that and and you would want more and to maybe do that you know something. That financially can help you but you did do you know what I mean, so you can start to start, you can start to see some of the positives to and acknowledging that maybe it's not where you want it to be today. But there are some things that you could look at and go, you know what I I did that, because to get I mean you went. to school, how many years."
13205.0,Patient,University like three and a half years I.
705.0,Provider,yeah three and a half years being dedicated and that the standard for College has way up here and you were able to do that and to be able to continue and to graduate.
13205.0,Patient,"yeah, but that was like 45 years ago and. But I don't have anything right now to show you know anything. I you know I write I used to do good but right now I can hardly write anything you know, like. I don't know i'm just. There, to improve you know, then improve in that field. and career wise nothing, nothing, nothing. i'm my marriages, I think I was married before this husband my I have this is my second husband. So I married when I was 23. And back then I married not out of really love or anything. It was out of. just getting away from my home, you know my parents and my home in Dubai. I came to the States I stayed with my cousin for a while and then I had no, you know Green Card, you know Green Card. Right or residence I wasn't a citizen here or have it. So, then, I met the sky and then I said Okay, you know his Nice is a nice guy whatever it was 10 years older than me. But then I married Mary and at that moment, I thought things that I don't know I wasn't really thinking, maybe that much. I made wrong decisions, you know. mm hmm I got married I wasn't a good marriage, but I was thinking Oh, if I have a child, a baby, it will, things will be okay that. When I had my daughter. But of course didn't fit things didn't get better. and eventually I left him and went back to Dubai with my child with my daughter, she was very two years old, or something. I stayed in my again my parents house. And I wasn't working again so you know it's just. I was always like having somebody I need somebody. To take care of me is either my parents or my husband. So I never would you know that's the Part I. I think about I. Have. It hurts me a lot. But I can't change it, of course, you know I can't change anything. But I always say what if this What if that but. This is thinking large you know my my mind is. That the all of this say I don't like me. I don't like."
705.0,Provider,"that's where she millas you were talking about things you don't have control over and things that that you do and that's where part of you and I, working together is to help with doing you know this different. Having a different way to look at things having a different way to look at yourself. Where you know to me when we first met and started working together you've made such great progress and and I know from hearing you you're like, but I want more. And I think that's great, and I think that there's different things that you can do to build to where you are or where you want to go but it's also for today to be like you know what. there's some things that I do like about myself. Like for someone to go through more than you know, to go to college and successfully pass and get your certificate, I know, can you can you say something about yourself that you appreciate with that. I could quality that you have."
13205.0,Patient,"honestly. know. Quite honestly, yeah. I was pushed I did good I studied. as hard as I could I wasn't like all a's or whatever, but. But. you're smart I did. What you know. And the other thing is either friend and she didn't know where the English. and I. Well, she was one of the few friends. At that time I had a boyfriend there too. and I use English either. So I used to write essays for school for for one of the classes, we are to write essays and I used to write two essays. For with one. subject you know. But I would write one for me and one for him. So we cheat I mean we cheat me he cheated, but I helped him cheat."
705.0,Provider,"At the time, it felt right right and you're."
13205.0,Patient,right because I just wanted to do some you know when you love somebody you do things you know.
705.0,Provider,And plus you're super smart shema so.
13205.0,Patient,"I was able to dry. You know phase. One subject and different wordings and different things, so I thought. and that's you know. I know I can write one sentence, but I don't know how I did it but. yeah but yeah I did good, but then that friend another girlfriend I had which I helped a lot and everything now I don't talk to her anymore that's another story, but she I know she is a real estate agent. And she's doing she's very successful. I saw her on Facebook. But then again. i'm the one who helped her get her degree. And i'm the one who is here, and she is you know working and she's you know she has very nice, you know, whatever I don't know personally but. from outside. You know she's."
705.0,Provider,"Would you be surprised melon at some time, sometimes, the more people are on like Facebook and things like that, where they have to externally show things. That sometimes that's a good indicator that they don't feel secure about themselves and that usually by posting things they're getting their self esteem built that way and I don't know if that's the case with that, but i'm just."
13205.0,Patient,"Saying no I don't know I don't know. I know sure ship seems happy well, maybe she's not I don't know, but I just see her, she has a career she's doing she's working she's."

I don't know, for me it was always about that issue. And that's why I feel very again worthless and inferior to everybody else I look around. That why couldn't I work get a job, what couldn't what couldn't."
705.0,Provider,"You were saying chmela that you had your daughter, and then you had your son right."

705.0,Provider,mm hmm.
13205.0,Patient,"And it felt like you know I miss him and all that but I don't know if it was deep in slide was a way for me to escape again my. away from my mom and dad's house. You know I have doubts about that. That. It was like okay. This is a way to get away, and I have found somebody who loves me and. Well, I loved him, I guess, I don't know and I thought moment, I think I. But. I don't know I don't know i'm just make stop me stop like. Because I came here and then again I wasn't working at all and. Then I had my son and then. The depression hit and then. Have we had good times good times but.

But you know what do you do you know. i'm so happy to have you i'm so happy to."
705.0,Provider,"i'm not sure where you might have not been paid to be a parent, but you were working all these years where you raised, your daughter you raise your sons and then that could you really put a price on being there for your children."
13205.0,Patient,"No, no, no, I in that. department of having children. I was. I think i'm lucky because. I some trouble with my daughter at first or know when he was she was teenager and for years, but. she's now you know she's okay. But my son's. I don't remember ever having a problem you know, like oh my son did this, and I have to do this and. There were always very good kids you know they're good kids. And that's what my husband was saying last night, you know. Look at your typical our kids look at the kids. they're not in drugs they're not you're not. You know, doing bad things they're good people you know. Right you. were raised good people in the society so they're not that successful you know but they're doing good now okay."
705.0,Provider,"You had a major role in that chmela and that's what I mean by it wasn't a paid position. But then any amount, you know of what you did, for your children and the knowledge, you had by going to college and and being resilient and having things like that that you did help to with your children and how to communicate with them and to share."

Because in my my mom and dad I know they love me somehow but i'm sure, but we, I never got that old like loving hugging hugging love and you know, no, no, none of that. When I was a child. It was like this is my mom, and this is my dad with my dad I didn't have at all, a good relationship. I didn't like. My mom was a good but I don't remember maybe I forgot maybe i'm not I don't remember hugs you know. mm hmm verbally saying on sharmila I love you might your this you know I know I didn't see those things in my child's room. They took care of me yeah."

705.0,Provider,And that's a great achievement.
13205.0,Patient,"yeah i'm like I like doing things for people, you know it gives me satisfaction. It just I love giving I, and I don't like. Receiving that much you know, like I said, sometimes people give me a gift i'm not very good at getting the accepting gifts it's weird oh."
705.0,Provider,"i've heard the you know before shema that's that's actually pretty common and a lot of times because you were saying how your parents didn't show you that affection. That it's common then as an adult or even as a child that you learn not to express yourself, you learn not to feel like worthy of maybe receiving a compliment or a gift and so these types of things sometimes happen."
13205.0,Patient,"yeah I feel weird. My friend comes and gives me like something I said. Why you go. yeah but if I, if I can give something oh my God, you know."
705.0,Provider,"It is coming from, then more of let's say you know when the parents weren't on you know. I just say like dysfunctional family where they weren't there as far as the nurturing part and a lot of times, then, is just working on, if someone does give you something and it feels awkward at first it's just saying thank you. or things you know I appreciate that it's coming up with your new ways I just had worked with someone before you should milla. Some of the similar. And so what they're doing is working on say you know I appreciate it or two thumbs up or something."
13205.0,Patient,"But deep inside. yeah I feel like. Then I have also, I want to give something and, if I can. First of all, I don't know I don't know if it's even a matter of mental thing or anything but I never know what you always want to give somebody like the right thing, but never know what's the right thing, so that's why I usually hard for me to buy."
705.0,Provider,mm hmm.
13205.0,Patient,"All right, it's hard for me to buy things for myself even. I can decide, you know i'm very bad a decision making, but I go to a store should I this. This this, then I get all anxiety out Walker."
705.0,Provider,mm hmm.
13205.0,Patient,"You know so that's why I can't buy things for other people, either because. My friend, my friend neighbor she's just goes through just picks up things and just. You know very easy buys this for this that's and that's how I do buy things for people I can buy one pen for myself. i'll go like Oh, is this pen this one, this one should I this color that color and I think, and I think like if."
705.0,Provider,"People have that ability Shamil, and that is, you know, maybe their talent and gift. where you have other talents and gifts like you know telling telling your children that you love them and that they never had to question that they were loved. You are able to do that were a lot of parents they're not able to verbalize or they're not able to show that physical affection and so your your talent and and your gifts is being able to do those you know."
13205.0,Patient,"I I reached out to you know read a couple of. The last time I told you, I had that one friend that she just didn't talk to me for a."
705.0,Provider,While right.

705.0,Provider,mm hmm.
13205.0,Patient,"i'm not gonna lose you know. yeah the way I was putting I said. i'm gonna die we're all gonna die, and nobody would know if I remembers who I called or if she won't remember, so I was making it like that to myself."
705.0,Provider,mm hmm.
13205.0,Patient,"But it's not a big deal, you know. So I just called her and she actually she didn't call me right back she just send me a text and said i'm driving i'll call you later, and I was like wow. But later later later she called she texted me Oh, I was busy whatever so she but still I don't accept it because she has all been busy this are doing this and this happened, and this and that but still I don't expect to accept it because, when you're very good friends.

But then eventually she responded to me, she said she saw reframe it says i'm at a friend's house right now. When I go home i'm going to call you and are you okay. And I wrote back yeah I just got word that I didn't hear from you now that you're okay i'm happy to hear from you. So it wasn't really for me, you know. So I get that feelings of like. What if you know this person, what if what if. I get back things thoughts in my head, you know negative things all the things.

705.0,Provider,"You can use that chmela because now you've had experience, where you know that that's where maybe you tend to go. And now to be able to tell yourself those things like maybe they are busy i'm going to wait, you know and see if they respond because you've had some very positive outcomes, where people are helping you where you can see, you know, because sometimes that fear of rejection is debilitating."
13205.0,Patient,I hate. The rejection rejection is and the problem is mostly my rejections were. Some girlfriends you know. that's. i'm suffering.
705.0,Provider,"yeah so you would be. yeah. you're finding out she Mila though more and more that you're able to reach out to people and that you know, sometimes. With rejection that it can be debilitating and you don't reach out and then you just let things happen, how they happen. But you are bringing it back and saying you know what i'm going to try, one more time i'm going to put myself out there, despite having these past experiences. and see if things change and that you're making that change and that's why you know Shamil earlier, you were saying you were feeling better. The medication might be part of it, but a lot of it is the work that you're doing that you're willing to do by you coming into therapy going to groups you're going and where you've made yourself do walks every day and taking this all in those are things that."
13205.0,Patient,"I found it. I know i'm doing these things, but to be honest with you when I was really, really bad. I mean there wasn't no way no way I could do one teeny weeny thing that i'm doing right now. yeah I couldn't I mean I was just bawling my eyes all day and I had panic attacks anxiety attacks, you know the whole day was. I was in I was. In a very bad situation, but when I got a little bit. I felt like I I am. So. Then I said okay i'm gonna work for but i'm gonna talk to a therapist because at that time I couldn't even think about it. But. No yeah no the therapy. I wasn't good when I started talking to you, I remember that. So it was something that I did it, to be honest with you right because I wanted to, because I was pressured into it with my husband and I always thought I can't talk to anybody. I can't talk to a stranger I can't I can't I can't do this so much know what am I gonna you know I had all the anxieties of talking to face. So I always like to say I can do it, I can do it. For nothing but now, when I when I first talked to you, you were. I was, I felt comfortable you know you made me feel comfortable. and Now it's like yeah I want to. Talk to Valerie you know I want to talk to him. So thank you, thank you."
705.0,Provider,"Thank you for taking a chance you know and Shamil again on those achievements, most people suffer in silence, for many, many years, and sometimes never reach out. And so what you're doing as i've had people tell me they would rather do anything else besides come into a session and share how you feel."
13205.0,Patient,"yeah that's what I was that's what I was, I would just just because, like one time my husband took me to a therapist many months ago, when I was really again very about just crying that time and she just made the appointment and took me there, and he took me to. I said I thought i'm going to an office or something, but then he drove like for far from the our place and then I thought where's this and it was somebody's house. And the lady had like a. house with the like. stables, you know, like type how he had shared horses and hands and. That type of thing. So she took me there he took me there, and she was asking me like, why are you crying. I don't know. i'm I didn't have a reason I was just crying oh I couldn't stop crying. It was not like something happened to me at that moment, but then she was like she wanted to take me, I think it was a third like go and be with the animals, you know."
705.0,Provider,yeah like a as Korean or is query with the horses into therapy.
13205.0,Patient,"yeah something like that so she she said let's walk and he went to the stable and we were like oh this or this is this on this is that the hands and the things were running around and sure, but for me oh my God I hated it I. hated it I didn't want to touch."
705.0,Provider,you're like I want to touch the animals. Because germs.
13205.0,Patient,"This moment smell of the stench you know the stables have a stench I didn't want to establish. And I was in such a bad bad shape. That there, it was just more chaos for me. No, it was just more chaos and more like oh my God is dirt have to like what am I gonna i'm walking in this thing this noises, and this is just so it. backfired you know it was like I my husband got upset with me I. Just i'm sure she told me just give me one one month and i'll help you know. I said I don't want to be I don't want to be I don't want to be you don't want to take me take me, what did male female. So. yeah you know, this is one experience I had that that's not fun."
705.0,Provider,"You were willing, though, to give it another try and you haven't given up chmela and so acknowledging that. that's one of the good qualities about you is that you are resilient and you really are like no i'm not giving up. i'm going to keep doing it, and sometimes with with therapy, especially external forces bring a person into therapy, it may be a significant other. Sometimes criminal justice system may bring someone here all kinds of things, but. it's you that's doing the work and so giving yourself credit where credit is due it's you that decided to do the work it's you that's coming in here and being open and honest and so you've been really able to overcome that fear that a lot of people have about therapy."
13205.0,Patient,yeah.
705.0,Provider,yeah even when you had an experience that wasn't a good match for you.
13205.0,Patient,"My husband says i've taken either. I don't remember I don't remember ever being in a really therapy, I went once again with my husband and my son my husband had a therapist few months ago again. And he took me he said come and join us. But I know, there was a guy. I am, first of all i'm sitting with my husband and my son in a room. I cannot say anything you know. First of all. But the other part, is was very uncomfortable that office, again I have i've OCD and keep saying that I know no I heard maybe I don't but. That office I didn't want to sit on the Chair, it was, like you, you don't miss it. The SOFA so old I can sit in here, I was sitting like on this on the edge of the tech on the edge of the. chair like like I was so uncomfortable and. So it's also those things you know and the guy I didn't get I think he was the one just talking and talking and talking and talking the whole time. and I said, you know what I don't wanna. I wanna."
705.0,Provider,"i'm glad you took a chance and that you're here, and you know with. Where you were saying the OCD and if sometimes the things like wanting things sanitized is that the more that you understand it, you know, the more that you understand that piece of you that are more it's like okay well learning to do things to help manage through that too. and"
13205.0,Patient,"I do, that like right now. I don't want to go to a hotel I used to go, but now I can't think of sleeping on a bed that I known many, many, many people have slept on it."
705.0,Provider,mm hmm.
13205.0,Patient,"I don't know I want to. Get that out of my head, you know."
705.0,Provider,"yeah sure Mila is thinking you know things like that and it's great that you're like Okay, I have a desire that I still want to stay in a hotel, how can I make it where I feel secure and safe in that environment. And so thinking outside the box where could it be Jamila if you brought your own blanket to put across because you know you."
13205.0,Patient,Look at me says to. him is bring a blanket this.
705.0,Provider,Your blanket that you know that you washed it sanitized to put that as a barrier.
13205.0,Patient,"yeah. Well yeah Oh, to be honest with you right now I don't want to go any."
705.0,Provider,mm hmm.
13205.0,Patient,"My aunt is like really, really insisting like insisting but she's like. Just come come and visit, please come, and you can do what you can do it just. really wants me to go and see you know, be a trip to Australia. yeah but it's true too much. Too much."
705.0,Provider,"Right now for right now but i'm also hearing Jamila that for right now it's not your priority but you're willing to take a look at it. And, knowing that you can build up to it because you're right now you're laying a really good foundation of your you're doing these different things like your walk that you're doing each night, are you pretty much doing that every night."
13205.0,Patient,yeah yeah last night I did the night before I was so windy and horrible but I.
705.0,Provider,Did it.
13205.0,Patient,"Last night I was just about to leave I wasn't doing well at all last night. I said, you know what just a Christmas, the work, so you have done something yeah so I went on a la la you know dragging myself and I put was putting my shoes on I saw my husband downstairs as oh i'm going to costco. Do you know what do we need doing it this and that, and this is, and then you said what's your gut said and did you want to go to class and I thought about it, and I said well. Okay, you know, so instead of walking there. Maybe i'll just go to costco. So I was able, actually to go to a store, you know."
705.0,Provider,that's great you successfully went to costco.
13205.0,Patient,"I went to successfully to costco I. Actually, looked. Around but you know needs they need, we need this, we need that we need that we need. And I was like again my energy, all of a sudden will from like our blah, I was like no rain here and looking at this, looking at that dinner, and my husband was kind of a little I felt he wasn't doing so good, but I was the one just like. carrying this I put this put their i'll take this to the car don't worry you sit down i'll do that oh."
705.0,Provider,yeah that must have felt good chmela because costco it's a task to get.
13205.0,Patient,"That test but but, for me, I but I always enjoyed it."
705.0,Provider,yeah.
13205.0,Patient,"I always before, when I used to go long time ago I used to enjoy it."
705.0,Provider,"it's being creative like that I love you know Shamil and that you wanted to go for a walk and you were willing to be flexible, that you're like you know what i'm going to invite something else, and today i'm going to go to costco and then you did it. So you did your walk and you went to the store and you're able to get things that you need and things that you liked, I think that that's a big highlight for you for this week."
13205.0,Patient,"yeah yeah was. It wasn't nice tonight I am I will go, for I know the weather, whatever I think it's doesn't look good outside maybe it's too cold but i'm gonna. Go for a walk my cup my friend Kelly friend she called me, we talked last night, she said, maybe tomorrow. we'll go together, but she works, she because of her heart and her legs, you know and things I work very fast right now but I always have to it's very hard for me to have to control myself like okay i'm really I have to walk slow now. that's also a thing you're not I can't walk slow."
705.0,Provider,mm hmm.
13205.0,Patient,"When I go for a walk I start slow, a little bit, but then, all of a sudden it's like I can't stop. But so she's i'm going to call her maybe maybe I can spear and it will be nice to."
705.0,Provider,Get out and do a walk.

That that would be great, and you know she Mila to is now building on if I know your goal before was to get out of the House at least walk five minutes but building on that so maybe if it does get too cold and you wanted like. You know, do a YouTube video of some type of Zuma dancing or something else. Or maybe."
13205.0,Patient,No dancing.

705.0,Provider,"Okay, well, I am glad Jamila that you are able to set a boundary where you're like like i'll go for that walk but i'm not dancing that's it. Ah. While sheila it's been great seeing you and I am just thrilled to hear some of these things that have been your successes."
13205.0,Patient,"Thank you, thank you, it wasn't it's nice it's like I can report to you and get a feedback, you know."
705.0,Provider,"yeah we all need some motivation Jamila and sometimes it's just that is just putting it out there and saying things and being like you know what. Because I have this support i'm going to try that five minutes, and then you start walking and you're like you know what actually I could maybe do 10."
13205.0,Patient,"And yeah no I should i'm doing half an hour now. wow yes, I 2530 minutes yeah yeah so I feel like it's like this around that block thing. Right, but the good thing that I can walk is like I can leave the gate and go somewhere or to sit in a car go to a park and walk I can do that right now. But for me just walking just in my own little circle around my neighborhood inside the gate and I can know I can come back and i'm passing my house and if I want I can go in the House. Right, it will time me."
705.0,Provider,"Yes, you know I can go."
13205.0,Patient,"Ahead no I can i'll go another time another run. But again, my house is here, and I can just walk in the House again. yeah so I have that comfort. That. I have my how my comfort place very close to me. But I will decide to do one more and i'll do one more but, again, oh that's my house, you know you know what I mean."
705.0,Provider,"I do you developed a system for yourself that works. And so, you know that there's your House and you're like hey i'm going to do one more, but I know my my."
13205.0,Patient,"few minutes you know 10 five minutes i'll be back there again. Right, so it helps it helps to me that's why I can go out and walk if you tell me walk now maybe to. somewhere outside the gate I don't I can't do it."
705.0,Provider,And right.
13205.0,Patient,"I guess I right now just. Talking about that gives me it gives you the children, the anxiety."
705.0,Provider,"And chmela there's no reason, right now, but even that that's something I mean you're you're already working up to. Half an hour of doing your walk and that's terrific and so being able, just to be like you know what i'm getting the blood flowing it's good for your mental health to be outside. You will then find other benefits, you know, so I think it's great and then tonight to hear that you make a walking you know, and maybe one of your neighbors it's the neighbor lady you're talking about that you might go walking."
13205.0,Patient,"Yes, yes, my friend yeah."
705.0,Provider,"yeah on to because it does get where if you're a fast Walker and having to kind of you know, get your."
13205.0,Patient,"dad i'm just saying like it's. Like now she always told me you look so fast, because she was the one before always doing that that's your wishes, even my husband one night she came i'll go one time with you and said, my God you're so fast. And I told him I said you're not going to catch up with me, you can catch I said oh my God, are you bragging to me. I said yeah because I know you're not gonna walk like me."
705.0,Provider,"Oh, and that is nice to have that competitive spirit, where it's like you dang right you can't keep up with me way too fast."
13205.0,Patient,"Or you. Can one time and said oh my God i'm done i'm going to go home. I say okay you go home. But I could keep continue, you know."
705.0,Provider,"Exactly and that's giving you two more and more self confidence chmela that then that comes out and other areas of your life too. And so you're regaining like a sense of self where you're like you know what there are things that I can do, do I wish I would have achieved some of the other stuff yes, that did not work out that way and did I do some other achievements like with my wonderful kids yes. here's where i'm going to build today huh."
13205.0,Patient,"yeah i'm trying i'm trying, I just have it still my issue of eating thing I don't know how to. go about that."
705.0,Provider,Are you are you trying Jamila to eat a little bit more words more I know you talked about you have your shakes mixing up with hummus and bread and.
13205.0,Patient,"yeah I still like it, I want to eat but it's just like always with. If i'm eating this or I shouldn't eat this you know, because the problem is, I know we will have time, but I know i'm a very every day, I take the scale. And I if. Like I don't know what i'm although i'm eating like very little and very, very. Healthy I mean I eat like. chicken chickpeas you know some chickpeas some pumpkin seeds and. Last night I did just one slice of bread with cheese. I was very hungry, but then i'm not losing any weight. And it's. I don't know why i'm up i'm got obsessed. obsessed with this. weight think. Right now i'm Okay, I look over my head no it's not that bad guy i'm good, but I just don't want to because i'm afraid if I eat a little bit more."
705.0,Provider,mm hmm.
13205.0,Patient,Then i'm gonna gain more no i'm not eating anything i've stayed at this. voice right now. And so. With that.
705.0,Provider,"that's your next thing that you want to work Okay, one of the things to Shamil is remember that the brain the food, food is our brain food and so being able to feed our brains. and being able to know that a lot of the way to if you're walking more it could be muscle mass and there's a lot of you know, sometimes a medication might."
13205.0,Patient,"might make a medication yeah. This medication Doc sipping i'm taking. yeah yeah. It says, you are. it's very hard people gain weight a lot I gained on it and then now that i'm trying to not. eat, but during the day i'm not hungry that's another issue."
705.0,Provider,"Right, he said, if."
13205.0,Patient,"I cannot eat. i'm i'm fine but evenings at night I my appetite as well, but anyway so yeah it was it resistant. Resistance my body's you know it doesn't it's the medication i'm sure it has to be the meditation."
705.0,Provider,"And it can be chmela and especially if your body's getting used to it and so being able to do like sometimes it's like yes. Can it make you have some weight gain some medication, yes, but the flip side of that is can without the medication, you may have other stuff so you're starting to see medication be therapeutic. By you walking and things like that too is helping with that, so you know, and I know you know before we meet again next session is trying to think of it as you're eating more for your for your brain, I mean your brain to function properly."
13205.0,Patient,"I haven't lost. Any vitamins, you know I take these supplements. yeah but. yeah I have to, but I wanted to just. yeah you're right i'll try i'll try."
705.0,Provider,"Now, will you try and like one maybe you know, one day, this week, see if something else to Piques your interest that you might try to eat that you haven't been eating in a while, just to see if you have a desire for it and it might like satisfy you."
13205.0,Patient,yeah i'm saying it's like late at night. And it's very hard to. Have a food available at that time you know.
705.0,Provider,Right.
13205.0,Patient,"to eat and then, even if I have it my husband, I actually went and got me one of my is a Persian dish I love that dish I use, but even that dish i'm I take little portions of it. And I just usually eat it with bread. Excellent dish. It did with bread, but I i'm not eating the bread, you know, oh no I can't eat the bread, so I just like little little sports, you know teaspoons and I just."
705.0,Provider,yeah.
13205.0,Patient,"So get that craving of that thing food, you know."
705.0,Provider,"Right part of this will be to like other things Jamila like where you took the healthy risk where you called your friend, you know you texture we're at first, you were kind of like. yeah Oh, and then, what do I have to lose is being able to think of it differently to that the food, if you have the bread. The bread isn't the issue of going to make you gain weight and that this is more of a healthy nutrition and that your body needs it. and being able to be patient with yourself to that right now it's like for for weight management and stuff like that is getting where you're feeling better and then take a look at Okay, let me look at my diet, but to make sure that each day that that you're eating as much as you can."
13205.0,Patient,i'm not starving myself.
705.0,Provider,i'm quite good.

The other thing was just this home was and carrots, which I thought about one time, I tried and it was good, now, last night I went to bought a big bag of carrots from. costco and some Homeowners. So. yeah that's that's one of the newest things I right."

To continue to walk every day or to start to include other activities, such as like she went to costco and getting outside of the House."
