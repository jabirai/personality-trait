383.0,Provider,"yeah if you have an appointment scheduled, you can check in 24 hours in advance, you don't have to wait till like half an hour before your appointment to check in. yeah because sometimes the wait lines, the weights are can be lengthy sometimes people get kind of. This is just feedback from other people that i've heard that you know it's sometimes a struggle to be waiting and they don't like that so it's just good to know that you can check in so much you can check in 24 hours in advance."

17960.0,Patient,"yeah it was really great because you know when I was struggling and I relapse it was like we're kind of like not everybody's in recovery, but there is a recovery aspect to it, especially so many people being formerly incarcerated and. It was easy for me to speak up and be like hey i'm struggling right now, and you know it's just really great to like have you know not many people can tell their job, like a relapse and have everyone be really supportive so that's been good."

Okay, and it might you know they only known each other for like three months, when my mom. When you know. They can see me and my mom was like only 18 the my dad might have been like 21. And my relationship with my mom my mom is my best friend i'm talk to my mom like 24 seven we're really, really close. And she's always been like a stay at home so she's married, so I have a step dad he's wonderful his name is Derek. And he's been in my life, you know, since my parents divorce so since I was 13 years old. um and then see in my mom's always just been kind of a stay at home mom and now you know she still she doesn't work now, but my step dad does. And then my dad he owns a franchise business called snap on tools and my relationship with him, has always been pretty rocky and I would say he's just. I don't know if it's like I like to people like I like to throw around like he's has a bit of like narcissistic personality disorder like. But I think also he's an addict but I wouldn't see his vices so much drugs, not all the time. I know he does like coke and stuff but not, you know he he manages his life so you know, but he gamble's like on sports he's really you know. Like if the raiders would lose when I was little it was very chaotic, it was like the whole household is like he would just tear rice, the whole House, you know break things. wow yeah it was really bad and you know he's got very like knowing the definition of fanatics like it's like they're obsessive compulsive you know and there's a lot of like mental illness that runs in that side of the family, like my grandma was bipolar."
383.0,Provider,"Okay, just just hold on one moment we're going to get to that in. i'm just going to capture a little bit of this. Okay, so your relationship with him has been rocky."
17960.0,Patient,"Yes, and recently um I mean i've gotten, to the point, especially like I think I have 20 days clean today. And like I held a lot of resentment towards my dad but recently i've kind of let that go and even things like he said something is so we are talking again I didn't talk to him for like. Almost two years or like maybe a year and a half. But I recently reconnected with him i'd say about. A November. um and he actually I would say he's been helpful like he was the first person I told that I relapsed you."
383.0,Provider,Okay.
17960.0,Patient,"So we do have a relationship where like I can talk to my dad about a lot of things, whereas my mom has never dealt with addiction really. So. He doesn't really like understand where I feel like my dad does so, he is really cool sometimes but we definitely like buttheads."
383.0,Provider,"All right, thank you um do you have any siblings."
17960.0,Patient,"I do so, I have a I think she she's young how old is she 24 year old sister we're also really, really close, but she lives in Santa Barbara so I don't see her as often as I would like, but we're always texting, we have a group chat with my mom. And so we have the same mom and dad Okay, I have a brother. We share the same dad is he's 14."
383.0,Provider,Okay. did your father remarried.

17960.0,Patient,Oh no chrissy.
383.0,Provider,What is your relationship like with with her.
17960.0,Patient,"I have it, we used to be good At first it was really bad really, really bad, but it was kind of like that stereotypical like evil step mom just came in the House like took our pictures off the wall like moved her daughter in, and it was just a weird situation you know."
383.0,Provider,mm hmm.
17960.0,Patient,"And she you know my sister really doesn't like her. But i've kind of just let it go, because after I had my son I stayed with my step mom and my dad for a while, so me and my step mom you know I forgave a lot of things which I feel pretty justified in like that yeah she was in the wrong for that, but I let it go, you know. That yeah but now I haven't talked to her when I stopped talking to my dad and her and she you know when I stopped talking but. I, there is no like you know resentment or anything, there was just like you just stop talking um so I haven't really talked her even since I reconnected with my dad."
383.0,Provider,I see.
17960.0,Patient,"So I guess there's just no relationship, you know."
383.0,Provider,"Okay Okay, thank you um now, just to clarify is Sebastian the son of your current partner or."
17960.0,Patient,"No, he is the son of. Ex husband, who we have a rush, I was actually moved by the district attorney of alameda because of his abuse in i'm in like the safe at home Program. Okay, so we have this restraining order it's still temporary because cove it all got all these court dates just keep getting pushed back so. I am right as of right now he has no visitation or anything with Sebastian in order to get phone visits, he has to do, anger management program and there is a pending criminal case against him for stalking."
383.0,Provider,"So um. He doesn't have any visitation with your son, including phone calls. Right, based on the court order."
17960.0,Patient,yeah he was having supervised with the Supervisor was like Dean TIM unsafe and so those got canceled after about three months. So I since like 2019 he's probably seen Sebastian like 10 times that most.
383.0,Provider,"Okay, so he he was having supervised visits up until When did the those supervised visits."
17960.0,Patient,"August of last year. He had they only lasted about. Three months every other weekend. Sometimes, he would miss or he would call you know. So he didn't seem that much."
383.0,Provider,"Okay Okay, thank you we'll kind of circle back around to that in a bit, but. If you could describe your childhood, in general, how would you describe it in a few sentences."
17960.0,Patient,um it was chaotic. It was chaotic but and I spent a lot of time in my room reading.
383.0,Provider,mm hmm.
17960.0,Patient,"Because my mom that my parents were really over protective but then it's like my household was. You know, like my parents were always fighting my dad was always really angry. And yeah, so I think like I found one thing was like I feel like I really invest in myself in school, not knowing it, or the school always came really easy to me. But then I you know became really rebellious because of like issues, I was having at school, but I was like. In the gifted and talented education program and I think a lot of that had to do with like we lived in a bad neighborhood so I wasn't allowed to go hang out after school and stuff so I spent a lot of time by myself in my room. mm hmm in reading, like my, even if I used to get to my mom or take my book, sometimes because she's like Well, nothing else bothers you."
383.0,Provider,Okay. Where did you where did you grow up what.
17960.0,Patient,"So I lived in Pittsburgh California until I was about 12 years old, and then we move to Martinez."
383.0,Provider,"Okay, and was Pittsburgh, the the bad bad neighborhood. um yeah i've ever even a part of Pittsburgh."
17960.0,Patient,"Oh, really."
383.0,Provider,I yeah I mean.
17960.0,Patient,"Has conquered. Okay looks like there's Pittsburgh, and then it's antioch. If you've heard of antioch. Yes, but I never went to school in Pittsburgh, we would sit in traffic to drive me out to school over here and Martinez um so I wasn't really socialized in Pittsburgh if that makes it, you know. Okay, my peers were over there and Martinez, but we lied about my address so like I think that was another reason, looking back way. I couldn't go to my friends houses or they couldn't come to mind, because my mom didn't want them to find out their parents to find out we're lying about our address."
383.0,Provider,"I see. Okay, thank you um right so with regards to the substance, use, can you tell me when you were first exposed to substance use."
17960.0,Patient,yeah I was 12 I was in the Eighth grade and I started with lead.
383.0,Provider,"Okay, and was that at school."
17960.0,Patient,yeah i'd school some peers.
383.0,Provider,"mm hmm. And, and then, how did that unfold, how did your substance use unfold, from that point. Oh, it escalated very quickly like I think three weeks later, after I tried lead I haven't already done left."
17960.0,Patient,"In like my my middle school was connected to a continuation school where continuation schools, like you know where they send the naughty high schoolers. And so they you know it was easy like I had easy access to getting drugs and the people I hung around with that that's what we were getting into you know. escalated quickly, I mean within a. Week, so it was already like i'll i'll try anything you know."
383.0,Provider,Okay um and was that mainly math or other things as well.
17960.0,Patient,"Other things I wouldn't say I did I did get into math like pretty heavily i'd say like 19 but I had tried it at like you know 12 or 13 and. Because I remember my birthday is in February, I think I tried. We over winter break, so I had to have been 12 and it was like in December, the end of December so, then I turned 13 and February so around that time you know I. I tried math but I didn't like it, and then, then, but I really liked coke and I tried coke but I was like 13 I do a lot of coke X to see when I was like 14 I took a lot of Ecstasy for like throughout you know high school and then drinking. A lot of things."
383.0,Provider,"Okay, and. Did that just sort of continue on until a certain point, did you go start a recovery process."
17960.0,Patient,"yeah so you know, there would be times like where I would start and i've always like as soon as I turned 15 I got a job, but my motivation for getting job was like so I could buy more drugs right, so I could party harder. But I always had a really good work ethic, and so you know I learned like how to maintain right so sometimes I go like a few months without like using right. And then I would when I would use it's like, then it would I binge and then it went so i'd say I was in a jail this year of like 2014. I was selling drugs for my uncle I was going to jail I got a felony I almost went to prison and but, fortunately, the judge allowed me to go to rehab so I did a 90 day out, p yeah Inpatient i'm sorry."
383.0,Provider,"Okay, and how old were you at that time. You i'm sorry I was 25."
17960.0,Patient,Is 20 yeah 25.
383.0,Provider,"Okay, so this period, when you were selling drugs and then you were in and out of jail, you mentioned. You would relapse when you'd go when you get out of jail and."
17960.0,Patient,"Oh yes, so from you know the times, where I would be clean for a little bit, I would say that was like from the time I was like 19 to the time I was like 22 but then from. Up until I went to that out, it was like my entire life I stopped working, which was crazy because i'd always held a job you know my whole life revolved around drugs. Everybody That was all I did I made money from drugs, I did drugs 24 seven that was my entire world."
383.0,Provider,"Okay, and the drugs they were mainly doing at that time was meth."
17960.0,Patient,meth gh be drinking a lot. xanax.
383.0,Provider,"Okay. Thank you for sharing that and then you said you went into your ordered or the judge agreed to it into treatment and you went in to residential treatment. Yes, and conquered yeah. Okay, and. How long was that residential treatment."
17960.0,Patient,90 days.
383.0,Provider,"yeah I know you, you did mention that just capturing it all um and was that effective for you at the time."
17960.0,Patient,"You know what it was, it was um Unfortunately, you know I wish that was like the it, you know, like the end of my use, but what I realized in there was like it didn't like I had a time where I had some clarity and I can really think like where's my life going, you know. And then I found out about the organization that. i've worked for Kurt now and that really their formerly incarcerated students at uc Berkeley so and I found out about that I was going to meetings, but like just to get out of the rehab because if you get a pass to go to a meeting."
383.0,Provider,You know.
17960.0,Patient,"So I didn't get a sponsor I wasn't you know I. I didn't get it, you know, but I will go to meetings and that's where I found out about the underground scholars and. I swear like in that moment, I remember it so clearly like that's going to be redemption story i'm going to go to Berkeley and i'm going to be good. So it didn't start like I had a moment, and then I was like okay i'm going to go to school. And I did start once I got out of the rehab I did start going to school, but I also like with dibble and dabble every now and then until I got pregnant with my son, and then I was cleaned for almost three years."
383.0,Provider,Okay.
17960.0,Patient,"So it did, allow me some clean time, but it was like I didn't have any recovery, you know."
383.0,Provider,"Okay, thank you for that. So then, you had this period of three years, when you were clean. Okay. So, in terms of you did mention that there's some family illness, excuse me, family history of mental illness. And that's on your father's side."

17960.0,Patient,"No, I understand yeah like i've gotten really ain't like I feel like when I get angry. And like, especially if i'm feel defensive, you know, like i've definitely say, like the most hurtful things that I possibly can to like people that I really do love, like my mom or whether it be like my partner. up and sometimes I feel like in my head i'm like shut up like don't say that you know because I know i'm going to regret it, I know that i'm going to regret it. But it feels like in the moment. it's like I can't help it."
383.0,Provider,mm hmm. Any other kinds of outbursts like. hitting I mean it's trying property or throwing things.
17960.0,Patient,"yeah oh my gosh yeah and I, and this was like I haven't done it so long, but I was like. break my phone all the time, I used to like throw my phone and break it all the time."
383.0,Provider,mm hmm. But costs. and
17960.0,Patient,"That was before the iPhone so like you know your phone would just go quiet and you could put the battery back in and to be okay, so I don't know like. The fact that phones costs, you know, almost as much as a car nowadays that might prevent me from doing that, but also like older, like, I feel, even though I still do have behaviors that I want to fix I say as i've gotten older they're not I don't feel as Rachel. You know, there has been times i'd say like. Big i'd say because I was using that it was more like I couldn't control it, but I feel a little bit more level down now. But there's definitely some behave like I you know I feel like I know that I can be super controlling and I never saw it that way, until recently, because I, in my head i'm like I just want the best for everybody it's like I would, I think is best for everybody, you know. And i'm working at 12 step program now and I. Like it's really gave me some clarity, there you know just through hearing other people sharing like oh my God I didn't see that that was controlling behavior you know."
383.0,Provider,Good i'm glad you're so you're in a 12 step program now.
17960.0,Patient,"yeah and I have a sponsor and I just you know i've done a meeting, since I was 13 years old, like off and on. And I always felt like everybody gets something I don't get and I felt like i'm never going to get it, and then. It just clicked one day it was like I just got to the point of a call like the gift of desperation in like that surrender. And it's like I get it now like I don't feel left out of the club when I go to meetings anymore it's like I really know what these people are talking about you know."
383.0,Provider,that's wonderful and how long Have you had your sponsor.
17960.0,Patient,"sense the second day I was clean so it's been lately i've had my sponsor for like 28 days now, or 27 days okay. And she's got 25 years clean she's great."
383.0,Provider,"Okay, great. When did you relapse."
17960.0,Patient,"I would see my relapse started in. But it was like I will go through periods, where I was okay I didn't see it as a relapse then, but now looking back it's like it was a relapse you know. I would say in like I think march of 2019. But it wasn't like full blown. But it's like that's what I kind of lose my head like Oh, I can do this, you know."
383.0,Provider,uh huh. But there was some consistent substance use since.
17960.0,Patient,"Yes, and a lot of that started in. Because. With the court case that's been my number one trigger I would say, and I, you know I blame that for a long, I was using that is like well life's really unfair in this court, like every time I had a court case. I mean a court date and it's like I will go like that my biggest fear is like the courts finding out that like i'm some piece of shit drug addicts, you know. And then I would go a long period, or you know few months clean and then i'd have this court date and after the Court date, even though things are going in my favor it brought up so much for me and I didn't have a you know, a recovery support group or a network to deal with my feelings. That I would start using again."
383.0,Provider,I see. yeah.
17960.0,Patient,"You feel justified it it's like what have ptsd you know, like it yeah there is, I have like I know I have like a. Physical the ptsd I have physiological effects like I have nightmares sometimes i'm you know, I feel, like you, I feel like i'm fighting off a bear. When I feel that that scared because they i'm fighting for me son and his safety, and I know this person's nc you know it's like when I feel like that I just want it to go away cuz it's scary."
383.0,Provider,And the substances. provide you with a sense of buffering.
17960.0,Patient,"yeah they were, and then it was like when I don't have those those problems are still there, it feels even more scary because I know i'm not bringing my best self. And that's, the only thing i'm worried about it's like i'm not keeping my side of the street clean and I feel like i'm still letting him control my life. And I become like disappointing them, and I would say, like. When i'm clean like i'm a confident like happy person. For the most part, like, I do have my issues which I want to work on. But like I you know i've always been social like I don't have a i'd like I hear some people like they use because they didn't have confidence, and it gave them more confidence using for me does not give me confidence I eat me so."
383.0,Provider,"mm hmm, but it seems like what it's providing is a buffer from feeling afraid."
17960.0,Patient,yeah yeah.

383.0,Provider,"did that, how does hospitalizations help you or did you feel like they were helpful at all."
17960.0,Patient,"No, not at all, looking back i'm like those were horrific like Why were the doctors not seeing like that this child is acting out and just listening to my parents it's like. Why would a child be acting like that at 13 you know what I mean and they're just like you, are the problem you know diagnosing me, and it was like that's now looking back like that was totally wrong they were totally just like putting all of our family issues on to me."
383.0,Provider,mm hmm.
17960.0,Patient,"Instead of being like like who hurt you or like what's going on, you know, and I became very angry at that, and then I realized like my parents like when they didn't want to deal with me. They would just send me there, they will get points they got point they'll be like yeah she said she's gonna kill herself again when I really hadn't you know. And then they would just say that because they realized that that was just a way to get rid of me and not do like my mom had a new boyfriend my dad was like pissed off and my mom for cheating on him like nobody wanted to deal with me I didn't even want to deal with me."
383.0,Provider,"When you were 13 and you would say, I want to kill myself with you have any kind of little plan you know squirreled away or with that."
17960.0,Patient,"No, no, like some days I think in my head like Oh, if I just took a bunch of drugs, they can die, but it wasn't like I ever really thought it was going to do that, you know."
383.0,Provider,Okay okay um. Did you go to the same hospital. Those four times.

383.0,Provider,"I see, so you discharged out of the hospital to one of these a group home per month. yeah I just stepped down."
17960.0,Patient,yeah yeah okay.
383.0,Provider,um any current financial or legal problems you're worried about you did mention the legal but.
17960.0,Patient,"yeah it's not like you know legal against me, but having that i'm gonna have to go testify and there's a trial coming up my lawyer says it's going to be like a two day trial of like things you know I haven't been with this person and like. Probably three years and even when we were together, he was incarcerated for the majority of it, it wasn't like a real marriage, you know, like. in prison. So it's weird because, like it sucks because, like knowing that I have to go to trial there's certain things I can't forget, because I have to. kind of have them fresh in my mind I feel like because i'm going to be questioned on whether or not these things really happened. Which is frustrating because i'm sure you know, the dynamics of an abusive relationship like even for me to. Tell for me to finally come to the realization that yes, this is abuse into finally leave and shut that door was hard and it's very invalidating that i'm going to have to go to court and prove myself like I already had to prove it to myself, which was exhausting enough."
383.0,Provider,mm hmm.
17960.0,Patient,"And now it just court process just feels very invalidating. And I you know they have to keep these memories right and they happen, years ago, like, I want to just move past it, but I."
383.0,Provider,"can't right. Well, maybe there's a way of. Of. Looking at this as further solidifying your understanding of your of the boost that you. received and just just making that ball more solid you know if there's a way to kind of make lemonade out of lemons you know."
17960.0,Patient,"yeah no I like that, and I, so I actually i'm certified as a domestic violence advocate and I work for this organization called stand. In their domestic violence agency in contra Costa, and so I actually there's a survivor all she's also in recovery and i've been connecting with her and she's been through the Court like the legal process and she's been really helpful in stand has like. When I have court they're going to allow me to use their office i'll have people their support me because it is on zoom. i'm starting to build like. How am I going to approach this without the use of drugs and alcohol, because I know that's not the solution, I it just you know I love this saying like it's like poisoning myself and trying to hurt somebody else you know."
383.0,Provider,"yeah. yeah, how can you. fortify yourself in a healthy way."
17960.0,Patient,"Right, exactly, and I think you're right, you know, there is a way that I can go about this in a way that's like. I guess the word would be empowered and like you said, like it's solidifying like I got out of this and nothing and knowing like i'm not lying I know i'm not lying so. I can you know if I feel like I have more clean time I can be more confident in myself, please I don't feel like. i'm doing something wrong like are they going to find out a bit using you know, and I can go in there and I can speak my truth and you know, like, I know, in my heart that i'm not making anything up you know. And I feel like as long as I go in there with that, like confidence and just speaking the truth from from my heart, then things will be okay."

383.0,Provider,"Okay, great and what what is a main worry or fear."
17960.0,Patient,"The Court situation. Okay, and like what is that going to you know just the whole I worry about my son a lot to. Like I tried to see him for his four and a half year old self but I catch myself worrying about like 30 year old Sebastian which takes away from me, being in the moment with four and a half year old Sebastian it's like. You can have a drug problem like i'm an addict his dad's an addict in that worried and I see behaviors that he reminds me so much of myself that scares me. But then I try to remind myself it's like mean i'm not like the what you know, like I i've had my own journey and it's like I think as a parent accepting that like he's not an extension of me like he's his own human. Right like he may be like, just like I didn't even graduate high school but it's like I go to Berkeley now and it's like. it's definitely like a hard, because when you're apparently you just want to protect them from the world. And I you know I worry about so much because I just wanted to be happy and they don't want that to go through our things, but like that so realistic like that's how we grow as like humans like we all go through things you know we all have our own story. So I think that's something to that I want to work on it it's like. How anyway, just like let him be his own human and like I said i'm super controlling so I don't want that to like manifesting like quite parenting like of course i'm the parent I have there's some decision to have to make for him. But it's like. Also, how do I foster him being like his own person, you know."
383.0,Provider,"So the the some of the goals for you, for therapy are around your son raising your son your own fair and vulnerability any other things you can just think of now about that are some goals for you for your for your own treatment here with binary health."
17960.0,Patient,"yeah I really want to work on like my irritability. Like I feel like I just get irritable sometimes, and one way, I want to learn to cook I am I am going to get some like essential oils in start working on the more like affirmations and so just like grounding myself. You know, like taking. And it's like I know a lot of grounding techniques, but it's actually like doing them when I need them, because I feel like when I need them the most is the time i'm not even thinking about doing that you know, so making that more of a daily practice like. prayer meditation stuff like that."
383.0,Provider,"Okay, thank you um what are you most important hopes and dreams."
17960.0,Patient,"Most so my biggest long term goal right now i'm my hopes and dreams, well, I want to make it to one year clean not like i'm going to get to one you're clean and then you know stop you know. be like okay now I can use, but I just feel like that, having that one year and recovery will feel really good. In the you know and then graduating. From Berkeley. mm hmm and. Eventually, want to get my master's. it's hard to say though i'm right now i'm kind of in the mindset it's like I used to hear people to like if I just put my recovery first. And then, like you, can't put your recovery first like you have to worry about your job, and your school and now i'm like no like if I don't put my recovery first everything else is going to fall apart. So right now it's just like my focus is like working the steps, but doing it at a pace, where i'm not rushing myself. So that is a long term goal, I guess is like eventually I want to have like worked all the steps. yeah and graduate."
383.0,Provider,"Okay, and graduate from Berkeley or graduate from your recovery process."
17960.0,Patient,yeah or no from Berkeley sorry I get my recovery process is like you know I know that I have accepted that's going to be a lifelong thing and i'm happy with that.
383.0,Provider,"yeah yeah. Okay, good So is there anything else that you feel is important to share or to say. Or do you have any questions for me."
17960.0,Patient,"No i'm not like I feel like I got you know, this is a good start, I feel like you know enough about me and like where my issues you know a lot of the things that like consumed my life. Especially like you know with the ptsd and like things like with my dad and my ex and I think those are things like I look forward to working through those."
383.0,Provider,"yeah great Thank you so much i'm just one one thought is just the about the irritability and. If you can engage in some of these things that are calming for you that you. That you notice viscerally after you participate in them, whether it's the yoga or the running or. or whatever, and you notice that you're calm or afterwards that you feel more grounded really soak that up and pause and just and just like. it's like it's like after drinking a glass of water, you know pause and just go okay i'm just read i'm fully hydrated now and i'm me feel this. rehydration let me identify with it, let me just like really soak it up, you know, whenever you're not feeling irritable and whenever you're feeling like. calm and there's not really irritability happening in your in your consciousness and you're being really be with that for for a little bit you know, even if it's just like two or three minutes, just like really so good, like so good, but but that let your all your cells like soak it up."
17960.0,Patient,"I, like all yourselves, I like that thing."
383.0,Provider,"yeah because I think that if we wait to use the coping skills and and we're not just like cultivating when we're not triggered our baseline of like good saturated. healthiness then then we're more susceptible to the triggers but if we're really. Working on the soil of our a good nurtured itself other times, then run it's like when the spark hits it will, it will be hitting something that's. You know kind of ready to be exploded."
17960.0,Patient,"Right right, I like that a lot. it's like i'm i'm lowering like my baseline of like Okay, where i'm about to like snap or just like if i'm already Lino like kind of balanced, you know. it's not like. it's not so ready to just snap."
383.0,Provider,"Right yeah. Good so. Now we're going to make another appointment, then let me just call the things up here that I need to. access."

You know, wishing that she could evaporate or. history of you know those kinds of thoughts history of childhood hospitalizations due to statements related to a suicidal intentions, but she does not report any current. suicidal ideation any current intent or any current plan and or no recent history of the above, so let's have her a suicide risk assessment on this initial treatment plan to be no risk, but if you could please identify those risk factors and protective factors are engagement in treatment. Again, no stated intention or plan no current suicidal ideation and strong social supports. As protective factors okay Thank you so much."
