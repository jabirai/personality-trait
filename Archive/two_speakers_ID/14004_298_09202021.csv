298.0,Provider,Hello there.
14004.0,Patient,Are you doing.
298.0,Provider,"I am doing well i'm just looking over our last note, can you turn on your camera."
14004.0,Patient,"Oh, I don't know how to do that let's see this is all kind of new to me how to oh wait, I think I got it. Here we go."
298.0,Provider,"Perfect perfect okay so um you're taking out of on point five, as needed how much have you needed it."
14004.0,Patient,"depends I usually take it if i'm going through some stress and I don't think I can you know, like, for my anxiety is pretty high. I might take it. once or twice and then I won't take it for a while. Okay last. lesson we took out of him was like maybe two and a half, three weeks ago."
298.0,Provider,Impressive okay that's how it's supposed to be used good job. Okay.
14004.0,Patient,I know that sounds funny but I actually probably there's times when I probably should take it more i'm just not really a go to it doesn't occur to me to go oh I should go take this pill right now help me out and sometimes i'm like oh my God that's right I got something but.
298.0,Provider,i'll be like.
14004.0,Patient,"You know. You know I mean but it, but it works pretty well what I like about it is I don't really feel like I have any lingering effects of it. mm hmm, in other words it doesn't like make me all loopy you're making want to go to sleep and I don't wake up the next day and feel like I you know. Sometimes the seroquel that I take, I have to watch how I take it, it really I feel the effect of it a lot, the next day."
298.0,Provider,yeah yeah and some people need to cut it down to 25 milligrams.
14004.0,Patient,that's what I tested it still.
298.0,Provider,"it's still iffy Okay, are you in need of any refills."
14004.0,Patient,I don't know I forgot to check i'm also taken in or tripling.
298.0,Provider,nortriptyline 10 milligrams once at night.
14004.0,Patient,"Now that one I know i'm going to run out of because I take it every night, no matter what. Was I think my prescription is set for 50 milligrams on the circle. But I have a pill cutter and so sometimes I cut those in half. And i'll just refresh it on this, I think we discussed it, but I wouldn't expect you remember, but um if I wait until i'm ready to go to sleep and take the seroquel it's going to make me to groggy in the morning, so I almost have to remember to take it an hour or two before I go to sleep. it's just how it is and if I wait too long and take the 50 it's going to mess up my next morning and so that's when i'll take the 25."
298.0,Provider,Okay.
14004.0,Patient,"So that that's kind of how I use that. But it really makes it hard for me to get up and get motivated taking that that circle really I can really feel it and I don't even take that much, but so."
298.0,Provider,"I know, and there are people who are take 700 milligrams and i'm like. How does it not flatten them."
14004.0,Patient,"I know I talked to a therapist and she almost was kind of condescending about the matter was taking because, just like I have patients to take out like what you said 300 and i'm like okay well I don't hope and how are they are, but I can. tell you I."
298.0,Provider,Would flattened me too so.
14004.0,Patient,"i'm not. i'm not used to medications, I can tell you a couple times, where I took the 50."
298.0,Provider,mm hmm.
14004.0,Patient,"It was scary to me I woke up in the middle of the night and I felt like I was going to die, and I was afraid to go back to sleep, but I was so drugged that I was so tired, because the drug was in full effect, but like. I i'm going to over exaggerate this a bit, but not by much it was fear that kept me up, I felt like I had to get up and watch TV for a while the middle of night because I was afraid to go back to sleep. And I was taking i'm just saying how a bunch of hit me now now granted i've gotten used to the drug more now. I think that's part of it too. So that was when I was initially trying to take it, but it was it was like scary to me I I really felt like I went to sleep by myself preaching and i've only got one recently happened but i'm just telling you that's how drugged I felt, you know I mean that was not a very, very good thing. So. If I don't take it, I won't get enough good sleep. So i'm trying to find that balance with that."
298.0,Provider,"To me, I prescribe to you the 25 milligram tablet."
14004.0,Patient,"Well, I really rather, not because I I try and take the 50 boy i'm saying it's it's too late in the day too late i'll cut that in half, so I can still take some, but I just don't want to take the full dose."
298.0,Provider,Does that make sense yeah.
14004.0,Patient,"Often, not because I was trying to get myself up to getting used to taking the 50, which is what i've been doing."
298.0,Provider,"And seroquel, not only does it help you sleep it works with calming the brain down it helps with depression, so I mean it's got some other components to it that."
14004.0,Patient,I didn't know helpful.
298.0,Provider,In your life.
14004.0,Patient,I thought it was just for sleep I didn't know it did anything else.
298.0,Provider,"It does a little bit more. How how's how's life how's your anxiety, how are your moods."
14004.0,Patient,"Well there's things that I can't change and that's where a lot of my anxiety comes from I actually think i'm handling it pretty well, I think the lack of sleep for a long time was affected me a lot, you know not getting deep sleep so circles help with that getting the sleep. i've kind of learned to identify when my anxieties high they go oh yeah I should go take the out of, and you know kind of a thing, and I can take the advantage anytime when I mean, is it won't usually be in the morning, it will used to be like maybe afternoon or early evening. But I realize i'm stressed out and so i'll go ahead and take that to kind of. Things, but I know if I told him when winter, but I went i've gone through a big legal thing and."
298.0,Provider,"That was very strongly, no."
14004.0,Patient,"Well, because I couldn't find an attorney to represent me and I basically got my clock cleaned and what's sad about, that is. So my husband kind of declining for few years but i'm self employed, so I I just work less. I probably would have been fired if I work for somebody else but because i'm self employed I just I just I don't advertise anymore I don't you know I just kind of keep my work with thing going. Through something that up is I don't make not making tons of money, but I have no debt and my credit spread because I manage my money well here's the thing I found out about how the law works. Is I was up against an employee that I had a problem with that work for chase bank filed restraining order against me but. What I found out and I won't bore you with all the details again but. Because I had to learn how to do a thing called discovery. And I ordered stuff from the police, because she made these all these claims that I was doing all this stuff so I asked for the videos of the police, you know when they come out with the body cam. And they didn't want to give that up so that that took like about five months to fight them to get that stuff. And, but I could see the conversations that they were having. and basically she wanted her employer to file a restraining order against me and they wouldn't do it because there was no evidence to back what she was claiming. uh huh so. Somehow out of the blue, she got this detective to come and interview her and just he didn't he didn't talk to their security, but they have a thing called global security. And everything he she said he just took us true meaning he didn't talk to any witnesses and getting proof and then. So I got a rest of based on that well the district attorney threw it out the next day, but I didn't know that for three months because they give me three months, out of the Court. So, and I never got the police will give you are, you may not know this, but when you're accused the police will give you a copy of the police report."
298.0,Provider,On that yeah.
14004.0,Patient,"yeah so, even though I was arrested, I had no right to get the Doc the police report. So, once you go to court, I would have got a public defender and then they can access it at that point well when I finally went into court, I found the hand me a letter and found out the day after, I was arrested. And by the way he charged me with two felonies so it cost me for bail agent a discount I got a discount so 7% of that was 40 $200 it cost me to get out of jail. So I could either sat in jail for 10 days, because they said because of covert it would be a 10 day wait to see the judge. Because I thought I will okay i'll spend the night in jail, see the judge in the morning tell them I got a business, you know I. go over whatever and you can reduce the bail, and maybe this, let me go on my own cognisance right well, they said no it's going to be 10 days, and it was also I was in they put me in a room with this guy that was coughing so I didn't know. How sick and work was up with him, and then they said you'll. be here for 10 days, so I said I got again I have animals and stuff to take care of and I have a business, you know that I run and. So I had my option was to like you know, use the credit card to pay the 4200 so that was a pretty big hit financially um but what was worse is when I went to get attorneys they were. I went down. Oh, so, then a couple months later, I get Sir okay so i'm out of jail I go to this court thing about a week and a half after my court things bad I get served. A guy comes up and he said he comes up to me, next to my truck he was following me and says, you know you've been served and so that's how I found out about the restraining order."
298.0,Provider,uh huh.
14004.0,Patient,"And so I. started working on that, and she made all these claims, and so I went and found out there's a thing called discovery and i've said look i'm going to need to see. What are you using to base your claims on because you've offered nothing here to support that I know I went didn't do these things so. At that point, reason got gentle at that point she left her employer no so you remember, I told you for employer wouldn't file for one and I saw on the video telling police one of our co workers actually on one of the videos was saying. Our employer won't do this thing."
298.0,Provider,yeah.
14004.0,Patient,"And so out of the blue suddenly this other detective comes to gang busters now i'm going to jump around a little bit what I found out later because I was told some people, the story they go doesn't make sense, why would they arrest you without evidence right. And I don't know. The branch manager is married to a police officer, I found out in the videos from her talking."
298.0,Provider,mm hmm.
14004.0,Patient,"And she was complaining about how the person in charge that she'd been that was in charge of her complaints wouldn't do anything. that's, for example, he won't do anything so something happened, where they got rid of the one guy in a new guy came in and he did everything she wants it's really not hard to figure that out, looking back for karate. police officer husband made a call with somebody and said, my wife wants this thing done and he said no problem where COPs we're going to do it right, so the da through the whole case out because there was no evidence to support it right, but. But the guy came and they searched my home that he got one nobody ever called me. Nobody interviewed me I was leaving for work, one day, I got about half a mile from house I got pulled over and they told me they were going to search my home they're going to confiscate any guns. such and such but I don't own any guns, and so the heat she had one of her claims was that she said she was shot at. It okay okay wait wait. No bullet right no boy."
298.0,Provider,No.
14004.0,Patient,"But she's saying that she felt like she was. shot at inside her work so something broke a window and she said that she made it sound like it was an assassination attempt or something. And so, of course, they didn't file, it is that because nothing happened, but when i'm jumping ahead, I found all this out months later. So I got this restraining order thing, and this COP comes out and what he does is he said yeah i'm gonna rescue and. And we're going to search your House and we're going to confiscate guns and anyway, I don't have any guns and they went through everything that I own and all my vehicles and my home and my shop and they didn't find it, but what I do have is a slingshot. So he says Aha, this is it, this is proof that you shot at her literally. and use that and then he also I had a folder on my desk that said chase dispute. Because my reason for my complaint with the branch managers I threaten to take legal action because they had committed fraud It took some money out of my account like autumn. So this went on for a while I find a lot of yelling at her and saying i'm going to subpoena you directly into court under oath and blah blah blah was she felt like she was threatened by that. Legally there's a difference between threatening legal action and physically threatening somebody that's very distinct difference. But they went him just went where she says she feels threatened, so this COP said i'm going to have this guy thrown in jail, but you, but I honest to God think that he thought that she was shot at, and I think they thought they would find guns. So when they don't find what they're looking for that should have been the end of it, but that wasn't gonna be end of it, because this was a. COP doing another COPs favor, and so they. They took that and then they found my folder and I had her name and contact information and it. Was I looked her a moment I even found because I was going to subpoena her. And so, he said Aha This is proof that you're stalking her. Because you have her personal information, but it was in a line to have all the information for the Bank and the contacts were to mail and then, and then it had started my log of things that happened. Her name was in the line of that right and oh and, by the way, nothing happened at her house nothing happened to record the woman and I had never met in person, so neither one of us knew what each other look like."
298.0,Provider,So yeah.
14004.0,Patient,"So when you ask him about how my anxiety is. This has caused me a lot of stress for something arrested and not knowing what's going to happen for three months. yeah and I get the restraining order, and let me tell you something else i've learned the hard way. So she they have a thing called improper you know what that is where you represent yourself in court."
298.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
14004.0,Patient,So both of us.
298.0,Provider,was called pro se or something that is that. there's different projects but. it's okay.
14004.0,Patient,"So she and I were to say when I served her with the discovery saying i'm going to need to see what you're basing your claims on. She contacted her employer and honest to God, I really think that they were had like a pardon my language, I think they had an oh shit moment you had him thrown in jail. We weren't we did not do what you wanted, because there was no. Evidence or you know, like, I was ever seen anywhere I wasn't you don't mean it wasn't like somebody saw me doing. Fine, but then because their corporate America forgive my cynicism they go well, now we got to cover our ass because our employee had this guy thrown in jail. So they grew up with this high end attorney out of sacramento California. And they spared no expense so so I started getting stacks of papers mailed to me. Things all these terms that i've learned there's things, called interactive tory's. Their special interactive stories or form interactive stories there's admissions there's a request for documents and they bombard me with them all, and if you don't respond to these things like a bait say. thing called admissions is a good one, the mission said, did you did you will you admit or deny that you did this. Well, if you don't really. respond to it in court it's it's considered that you admitted to it."
298.0,Provider,"hmm well, I have to have a formal response right. So right."
14004.0,Patient,"time I go to these attorneys and I scanned all the documents and put them on a CD and I recall IP attorneys and most of them don't deal with several harassment it's kind of a new thing. Because it's not like a domestic violence it's civil rights movements, like a different category it's literally like between people that aren't related and. The last attorney spent two hours with me and he basically said. For how much they've. Basically, want to show them what our I was dealing with he said he was going to be 25 to $40,000. And I don't have that. I and so he said then, you know we can't help you, because this is what it's going to cost right. Well, what I didn't know. is ill, so I end up trying to represent myself, I had to go and spend I probably spent probably 300 hours over the last year of. I mean I can't even tell you how much time reading online learning about love learning this going to the library having to figure out how to find copies of forums doing I did it all myself. And then I went to court thinking well you know, if nothing else, the truth is what it is they have to prove which is accusing me of and you can't prove something if I you know I didn't do it so but um. I went to court and the judge basically said i'm not giving you any if you don't have an attorney i'm going to treat you like an attorney. So if you don't know the law that's your tough luck. And so I had tried to read up on you ever hear court where they go objection your honor objection your honor yeah just object, you have to object and then say what type of objection we're making."
298.0,Provider,Great.
14004.0,Patient,"Okay. Well, if you don't make the right objection. It doesn't fly, so it doesn't matter what the truth isn't all this and that and. that's why i'm going on, what matters it until after a while the judge was like God was getting angry at me. Because I didn't know how to be a lawyer and I apologize to her and so your honor I don't have a where i'm doing the best I can i'm not being disrespectful I mean I I do my best. And she got really angry with me and long story short i'll jump ahead, I lost the case. But she awarded them now, I have to pay all their attorney fees. So the. I haven't got the bill yet, but the but the guy that serve me the paperwork they gave me $2,000 just for that. wow because they sent a guy from sacramento which has over 70 miles and he says he made three trips in sacramento trying to serve me papers. wow hired somebody local but they use a private investigation for, by the way, not not a document servers they used to. So they charge $99 an hour and 70 cents a mile. And he's saying you can three times but, even though I won't go into it, I even added up the hours that he said he spent for their kind of a it doesn't even add up to like they said they wanted like 18 hours at night 999 bucks an hour or so it's like $2,000. The attorneys fees are still to come. hmm um so that 25 to $40,000 I didn't have to represent myself i'm gonna have to. i'm going to get a bill to pay their what they ran. that's stressful you're asked me about my anxiety, this is what i'm dealing with. yeah so the only way i'm going to deal with, that is, have to go into bankruptcy. So i'm 56 years old i'm hoping to buy a house soon i'm just waiting for the market, whenever it's going to drop that's my last chance to buy a house, for I get old and I figure okay so um. When I attorneys went to see him I had had like $10,000 saved up because i've been saving for down payments, you know for home and I, you know I said I got this much money and I got credit, but again, the guy said it's gonna be 25 $40,000 so I didn't have that much. And, but ironically, I will now have to pay their money."
298.0,Provider,"20 oh i'm so sorry. And because he was saying that they spared no expense, so I mean they were just sending me just."
14004.0,Patient,"I mean ungodly amounts and they're like the $2,000 service thing that was nobody would have done that normally if he didn't have tons of money right. So, so they won their case and the judge yelled at me got really mad at me at the end and said she actually cut the case off and said i'm done. i'm making a judgment, right now, so I didn't even get to do my closing arguments. And, which was that there was no actual proof of anything I was being the Jews died they made this big show and all paperwork, but there was still no proof. Oh, she got on the stand and cried and said she felt terrorized and which, which you know i'm not about the. shouldn't be scared and you know i'm not a physical I don't have any history physical violence, I don't own any weapons, you know um that's not my thing but. You know becomes like an act where she's up there, and the judges like well she's crying and she says she's scared so that must be true and i'm thinking what What about the proof, you know so. I lost. i'm trying to look into how to do an appeal so it's a whole nother thing. appeal was different than the case so I still have to go back and try get an attorney. So I may still need my my point being is is i'm either going to go bankrupt I got to take everything I have and invest it. Because it's do or die it's do or die either appeal and win or lose and i'm going to put this much data on this much debt and i'll just have to go bankrupt, but that's stressful to me because I pay my bills and have my credit rating, so you know over 800. buy a home, you know someday. So anyway."
298.0,Provider,"um I need to get going, but I appreciate the refresher on everything you've been through is there anything other than a refill that I can help you with."
14004.0,Patient,"Well, I know that my last guy was saying when he's retiring and so i'm probably going to need a refill for the seroquel and the advantage I just don't know where i'm at on those."
298.0,Provider,"Okay, well, I did send the seroquel I did not send me out of and i'll See you in group, and you can ask me for the advantage when you know how much you need."
14004.0,Patient,"i'm not out of that yeah What about the nortriptyline can you do, that one."
