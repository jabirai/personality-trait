177.0,Provider,person just. well.
12952.0,Patient,hi JESSICA.
177.0,Provider,How are you.
12952.0,Patient,Good how are you. So I don't know why they scheduled me for five they know I work till 5pm. Oh sorry I thought she's still with me at six.
177.0,Provider,"Okay um yeah when I thought you weren't showing up, I told another client, they can come earlier, I emailed them, so if they happen to show up, then I would wrap up but they probably didn't receive it so i'll keep that in mind. For six okay okay."
12952.0,Patient,Or do you need me to call do you need me to call them.
177.0,Provider,"Know we'll just keep this appointment now. Okay, that way because I want to. have that opportunity to connect with you it's been a while, since then, and then you said that you weren't feeling well so. Okay yeah It makes no sense it's a new way of the other clients that here."
12952.0,Patient,i'm sorry about that. crazy. Work mostly. yeah and then home to a little bit it's just been crazy.
177.0,Provider,But.
12952.0,Patient,Have.
177.0,Provider,what's been what's more concerning for you what's going on at work or what's going on.
12952.0,Patient,"Go um, I think, just like the motivation part. Again, and then i'm. Just like how know i've just been really down lately I don't know why. Like just real like like low energy and just. So I talked to the doctor on Tuesday and she she prescribed me well wellbutrin it's an. Anti depression, but. I haven't started it yet, because I had a couple of questions for her so i'm hoping that I can maybe get with her. Before the end of the week, and maybe ask some questions about it cuz she started she started me out at a high dose and that concerns me a little bit. Knowing that I haven't taken up medication before um and then also it would be my first antidepressant medication that i've ever taken in my life so i'm kind of nervous about."
177.0,Provider,"That that's a valid concern and number 10 that should have been enough awareness, to look at it and to feel confident enough to be able to. explore gather more information before taking the mix right because other individuals will just say okay we've aggregated to me i'll take it. Like having an old girl esteem and confidence and being able to say hey I could use judgment to so. I would empower you to do that, to discuss some of those concerns with a valid concerns you know starting a high dosage who's never been on antidepressants before and I could imagine if this was. discussed in a group setting it doesn't allow for you to really explore as far as you would like to go as in depth, because you have a group setting."
12952.0,Patient,"You know, but i'm hoping that will get me back on track and. let's see I don't know. I can't say how i'm going to feel because i've never taken antidepressants before but let's see my dad just started some and it's been helping him so hopefully. Hopefully it'll help me."
177.0,Provider,and medication.
12952.0,Patient,mm hmm.
177.0,Provider,So yeah same diagnosis.
12952.0,Patient,"Might he has a lot more. Like mental issues, I think, but I think my dad has also struggled with depression his whole life I don't know yeah and I think like i'm. more so now, now that he's getting older and just like how I mentioned, with my brother and my sister situation I think he struggles, with a little bit more now. than ever so but it's been helping him like he said he feels better and he feels like energized he said he doesn't like worry anymore, he can sleep at night. So."
177.0,Provider,How have you been on the medication.
12952.0,Patient,he's been on it for. Like like I want us to maybe close to three weeks now. Okay mm hmm.
177.0,Provider,"Yes, information, you know, two clocks by friends happy accident, you know, a side effects or a problem negative experiences with having a medication."
12952.0,Patient,He said he hasn't had any side effects he's on a low dose so. he's on 10 milligrams right now so.
177.0,Provider,i'm going to the doctor prescribing. Oh.
12952.0,Patient,"I know. that's hard. yeah so i'm thinking i'm thinking Maybe she she thinks that maybe i've taken the medication before because she did ask me. If I taken any medication, I told her that my previous doctor recommended wellbutrin at one point, but I never but I never took it, so I don't know she may be misunderstood me and in thought I had taken it at one point, and then stopped and then just trying to get me back."
177.0,Provider,On.
12952.0,Patient,But yeah I think that's a pretty high dose.
177.0,Provider,And you should explore that further with the doctor.
12952.0,Patient,"Yes, yeah I emailed her So hopefully she'll get back to me."
177.0,Provider,"Yes, she's very responsive so sure."
12952.0,Patient,Oh Nice. yeah yeah she's on it show like messaged me. yeah so solving scold me and everything she doesn't care. she'll call me i'll.
177.0,Provider,play around with so.
12952.0,Patient,yeah. she's really nice.
177.0,Provider,"I know we missed the last, as she mentioned that you weren't feeling well. And then i'm a curious if you got call it, because i'm our last section we're talking about. The vaccine and some concerns you have, and you feel a little."
12952.0,Patient,"ambivalent about. What happened yeah so my daughter she started getting sick. She called like a cold well I don't know if it was a cold, because I didn't take her to the doctor I didn't I wasn't going to take her unless you really, really needed to go cuz the. sum of all those sick people that are there right. So I think it was just maybe allergies or something, because we had like a cough and like a runny nose and all my gosh I started getting scared like what if we have cove it. And, but we stayed home and I rested for a couple of days, and it went away."
177.0,Provider,So.
12952.0,Patient,I don't know if it was like just like a book or. yeah mm hmm.
177.0,Provider,hey Lucy season. Like I got some generic to text about getting the flu vaccine so much up.
12952.0,Patient,it's low yeah true.
177.0,Provider,But how are you feeling physically mentally and emotionally.
12952.0,Patient,i'm feeling okay today i'm feeling good. I think just. I don't know so weird I can't even explain some trends how I feel. Because I don't have anything to be depressed about I just don't know why sometimes i'm just like down.
177.0,Provider,"know the seasons play a part in that as well. And I see you really like emotionally activated right so allow yourself to feel that so that you can bring more awareness. About perhaps what the connection is because I know in other conversations you mentioned like I feel this way, but I don't know why you know. People tell me this thing, but I don't think that's the case so I hear a lot of uncertainty when it comes to you and i'm wondering where that comes from."
12952.0,Patient,"Sorry, I apologize."
177.0,Provider,This is a space where you get to cry without apologizing.
12952.0,Patient,And then I don't know if it's like me just tapering off the medication to I don't know if that's taking effect or what but. We think just annoyed think it's just everything really I think just a lot of changes right now I think that's one of the major. Things that i'm late good trying to focus on is just tapering off the medication and it's just hard.
177.0,Provider,What are some of the thoughts and feelings that come up for you need to think about slavery.
12952.0,Patient,"or just say. No, I just i've been on it for so long, I just kind of feel like it's just. it's like without it, I just feel like I just i'm just not like to seem like it just doesn't know me like it doesn't. Like it just paranoid because bb realities hitting me I don't know. But they taper you off pretty quickly with this program so. We mean she's like really. Like the doctor she's really like um. I don't know how to see it she's just like role. She she doesn't like if you kind of want to stop tapering or if you try to communicate that with her like she doesn't really she starts questioning you like, she just. You don't really feel comfortable telling her like I just need to slow down for a minute or, again, I see here for a while, like."
177.0,Provider,yeah.
12952.0,Patient,"it's not that easy to communicate with her about it is because then she she'll just be like well why like it, and I understand you know where she's coming from but. I don't know if it's just like. i'm just like not just used to it, this is the first time that i've ever tried to taper off this medication, so I don't really know what to expect."
177.0,Provider,"So I hear that you have your personal thoughts. About you're taking process, and you have every right to have those that your body that's going to face and has a hue, you want to express those concerns with the doctor. But also, he that there's some form of intimidation fear about expressing those things, and then I heard that, as you were discussing you almost felt like you also have to protect the doctor because he said I understand why. And I want you to know that what we discussed in this session is confidential and private between us too. And so, if you don't understand it that's okay as well because, like I said this is your body, so you have every right to discuss the concerns that you may have about having a rigorous tapering process, as well as having a high dose of anti depressant medication. To this program is not tailored you know to want to enforce intimidation of any kind, so what I do encourage you to do is explore your concerns with adopted and even if you're uncomfortable for a short period of time and saying listen. I I don't feel comfortable the table presses, and she actually why tell me why exactly why because jocelyn, I can assure you that there's probably other people in your group that have the exact same feelings and thoughts."
12952.0,Patient,You seem like a lot of them hold back to. Like to get intimidated by her.
177.0,Provider,"Because it's a fear of and it's a power, dynamic and it's not meant to be set up that way, but because it prescribing doctor you don't want to mess up you know upset the doctor right. At my other job you know I also okay I don't want to you know say something in the wrong way in my supervisor you don't get upset and I. Do I really care i'm really expressing my true but it's that power dynamic, that is just set up in work environments as well and be structures right so. I understand that if I was in your position. I would feel some level. But the system is not meant to be intimidation, you know. I would empower you and encourage you to speak up to the gap. And I think that would be a good activity, because what I believe is that you have so much in different mode certainty and length is because you're not really being authentic about your thoughts and your feelings. And the way you communicate it your medical concerns in this discussion i'm making an assumption that. How you communicate in other situations. where he wants to speak your truth but they feel the need to protect someone else, so they you refrain from what she really don't think so that you can just make peace. refer. You suffer as a result from."
12952.0,Patient,mm hmm.
177.0,Provider,And the impact is your depression.
12952.0,Patient,"You know. So weird because I guess they see that the. I don't know, like the they say that the medication gives you like it can cause Depression and anxiety, but it seems like. is barely like that effect is barely hitting me now it's weird I don't know if it's the medication or but I I just feel like I didn't suffer from depression or anxiety like. Like six months ago, like it's weird it just all of a sudden just started hitting me like even at nighttime I get really bad anxiety and I haven't going down a very long time. So I don't I don't know what it is, I don't know I don't know phoebe tapering off. mm hmm maybe I don't know."
177.0,Provider,A multitude of things. They don't try to pinpoint just working.
12952.0,Patient,"You can be aware of those things, it could be the medication."
177.0,Provider,It can be you know the seasons changing weather changes since know depression is a very real thing. So many things the pandemic you're working from home the kids are at home there's so many things that can happen in this space. Just wrote down figure out what the heck is going on in your mind.
12952.0,Patient,mm hmm that's true.
177.0,Provider,"I want to share something with you um my son had a doctor's appointment today and I noticed that throughout the day I had like stomach discomfort. I ate something that I typically don't eat like I had like this chicken sandwich French Fries animal chip, and never really do that. um and then it was time to leave to pick them up for the doctor's appointment actual domain like Oh, let me put this in the car Oh, let me go back inside and get water like just doing these things, and in my stuff and I said. i'm nervous i'm nervous about this doctor's appointment, for whatever reason, and so my anxiety is presented itself. By eating things that I typically don't eat. And now, my stomach upset that's typically where I carry my anxiety. And now I procrastinate. procrastinate. So I realized all of those things were outside of my normal. And because it was outside of my norm. I stopped myself, and I said why am I doing all these things differently and realize it was my anxiety worry about this appointment, so I give that example not to take the full stack with you. But to give you a real life example of how."
12952.0,Patient,If you.
177.0,Provider,"think differently. Now we have to have that awareness and say, this is not me. i'm really question. What is going on why am I, you know behaving in this way. so that she can really explore the root of it. So that's what those series of steps looks like like literally positive I stopped. To really focus on what I was feeling and why."
12952.0,Patient,I never thought about that.
177.0,Provider,"So if you were to like pause in can use in session of the opportunity that you know list out all the different things, I know you mentioned the medication, what else could be a reason why you're feeling worried at night be depressed during the day."
12952.0,Patient,"What do you think home. As your daughter, what do you think. that's that's a good thing i've never really actually sat down and thought about what could be causing me to fill out we i'm sure if I really sat down i'd have a list for you. From. Your free. Doing getting off for. The I think like the anxieties just kind of like maybe, just like yeah like just getting off the medication now and just. I think i'm just so focused like on what am I going to do, like when i'm off of it completely like what am I gonna. yeah like, how is it going to affect me like what am I gonna like I don't know all these things just go through my head like. It might going to have thoughts of like using again or. Like what other substance or what are their issue like what are the thing, am I going to fall back on or what other addiction, am I going to replace with this one, if I can't like you know just a lot of things are just going through my head."
177.0,Provider,"And you don't trust yourself yet. And i'm going to point out something to. You don't need to trust yourself to tell me directly, or you feel depressed and anxious and action mom. Your mom experiences of witnesses your life, but she is not you."
12952.0,Patient,Right.
177.0,Provider,"So I want you to get comfortable with trust in yourself. Okay, what that looks like is practicing more right so and I like what you did at the end because you said you know what if I really sat down and wrote it down, I can probably tell you. He you and I record was asking me. I need more time. to think this through. yeah so I want to give you that alternative when someone asks you a question and you are really sure what the answer is. To ask for more time because you want to reflect on it."
12952.0,Patient,Okay okay.
177.0,Provider,"That helps you with getting more comfortable and being in your shoe up into excel being able to say don't know right now. Okay. And then, when you show up and you do know, I know that you've given me the truth, I know that i'm getting jocelyn. mature into jocelyn because, like I mentioned i'm a mom is part of your everyday life. But she really can't tell you. What makes you depressed today. True, what makes you anxious."
12952.0,Patient,You.
177.0,Provider,know that.
12952.0,Patient,that's true.
177.0,Provider,To me.
12952.0,Patient,"When I write down right here what I. So tonight i'm gonna write down i'm going to make a list of what things are are interfering or that's what's causing me to be depressed or anxiety because I think sometimes I just like. Like I know i'm feeling depressed like I get anxiety, but I just kind of shut it down and just put it behind me. And because I don't want my kids to like see me that way. have to put notes everywhere, because offer. See so. list Okay, and then i'm sorry What was your other question for me."
177.0,Provider,"I want, I want you to have more awareness of. Being able to when you don't know the answer for something. Making the request for more time."
12952.0,Patient,Another thing that we're working on to and group is about saying no.
177.0,Provider,we're talking about okay.
12952.0,Patient,"And instead of saying like sorry all the time for everything and I had such a hard time because they kept saying oh i'm sorry and she's. Like no don't use sorry and there you have to try to say it like to where you're not being apologetic and. You don't have to say, sorry for everything it's okay to say no to people, you know, without feeling bad or feeling guilty or so we've been working on that So hopefully that'll come along."
177.0,Provider,All of these different skills that are used to. benefit you in learning. How to establish boundaries internal boundaries within yourself as well as external boundaries. But also helps to build your your confidence trusting yourself.
12952.0,Patient,Okay.
177.0,Provider,"So, when you say yes to things that you really don't want to say yes to. that's not you presented at your office itself that's the part of you that wants to please others. so easy yes. And then you'll probably show up or do something and then you have like this remorse like your life or resentment even like they know I didn't want to do this, but here I am right so. In yourself, like in the victim state. Because resentment is victim anger. So you feel like someone has kind of forced you to do something you don't want to do. Nowadays, continue to build those resentments. And then maybe you just have like this outbursts or mash out on someone for something that is like you know very little, but because you've been building up this resentment over time, it just kind of it eventually has to come out. and resentment over time it builds up it comes out in the most unhealthy and unproductive ways."
12952.0,Patient,"Years that's where I think it's good for me to work on, you know say no, and. Not the you don't always have to say it, like in a rude way you can always see it. in other ways. They gave us a list like of ways to how to say no to people or how to make it sound like you're not being rude about it stuff like that. Because I know that's one thing i've struggled with the law, even since before like forever. i've always have a hard time saying no. yeah even during till this day, I do not drive my husband crazy. He says you're always given to everybody."
177.0,Provider,"yeah. yeah it does play an impact on, especially when you're in a relationship because typically don't have two people that say yes, all the time. there's someone that's the yes person is the vs to everything, and you have someone that maybe they're not necessarily always saying no but they you know they have a bit more balance with that. Industry meeting yeses and noes. Until the person that is more equipped and capable of saying no they start to look at the other person and they start to build resentment to. So, because of you saying yes to different themes, the person, on the other end that has a better balance of that says, every time she says yes it is she has to say no to something else. And that no impacts me."
12952.0,Patient,"yep. that's so true. there's a bunch of scenarios, I can just go into my head that."
177.0,Provider,That. That in anything costume.
12952.0,Patient,"yeah cause a lot of tension. fights you between you know, two between a husband and wife or whatever or. Two partners. cuz I know a lot of times to like. Finally, would like with my sister I would always give her money and stuff like that, and then my husband would say no, but I would do it anyways and. You could just never tell her no and. For I would say yes, but then I wouldn't have it, and then I would just sometimes like like if people ask me for something and I say Oh yes, like i'll do it. Or, I can do it, and then I really. can do it. yeah like all try to find ways to try to do it just you know it's yeah it's really bad if you have a hard time saying no you put yourself in a lot of awkward situations."
177.0,Provider,"But I think to what you should really want to know is what's the fear, what do you think will happen if you say no to someone else."
12952.0,Patient,"What what do I think what will happen. I don't think anything bad will happen, I think they would understand. I think. I think my kids might have a hard time, maybe. Hearing no for me because there's always used to me, giving in, or saying yes or. giving them their way. So I think my kids would struggle with that a little bit more than anybody else but as for my like siblings or anything I think they would understand."
177.0,Provider,"What that means, you are in a good environment. That will support you. bring those boundaries, because most people that ask this question to fear of saying no is that person so i'm gonna be upset with me i'm fear that our relationship is going to be affected in a certain way. Well i'm afraid disappointing others, but if you are saying that your experiences will be different than this is the perfect environment to practice that skill of saying no. And no one of the things are moving so, you know as a mom of when I say no, I give the reason why i'm saying no. And if there's another alternative that I can offer I give that option to them too, so it's like either take this now where you can be this and then sometimes it's just a hard no it's a no with the period and that's it. And that's okay to. Okay, because kids need to learn from early age, what minutes look like and. They have a mirror that always says Yes, they have no awareness of limits and boundaries and they grow up to be both adults, that you see that have no boundaries. years, and if you ever been around somebody that has no boundaries."
12952.0,Patient,comfortable yeah.
177.0,Provider,So practice that sometimes it's a know what the period. is sometimes know with a comma.
12952.0,Patient,"yeah my my mom she always she was good about that, but my dad were always you don't want to give in and say yes for everything so but thankfully we had my mom to teach us what know was and to teach us our boundaries and stuff like that, because if not, we probably be. yeah we're software, where we are now."
177.0,Provider,"yeah. minutes are good, though, because you know if you haven't rolled without limits people would show up to job interviews were no clothes. And you know there wouldn't be about signs, there will be an incident. Our world and our system operates within limits. We as individuals and citizens need to get it together. you realize that limits are good."
12952.0,Patient,"they're not bad us yes. that's another thing or need to work on too. Because a lot of times to like. Let me guess, just like relationship wise and maybe i'm not the only one that goes through it, but. I think yeah just. I know, like when my kids were younger. That would be like a lot of our fights a lot is me not saying like no and or like if my husband would say no, and then they would come to me, and I would say yes, and he would get upset because he already told them no um. So I think just maybe focusing on trying to be on the same pages him because he's a little more strict than I am like. he's his mom was really strict and I kind of had both strict in district so. It was kind of like you know I still did what I wanted. But then I had mom you know you know but. yeah, especially now that they're older and i've also learned to like communication is a key kids don't know. Sometimes we think they know and we we expect them to think like adults and we don't realize that their kids and they really don't understand. what's going on around you they don't understand certain feelings or why you know their mom feels this way or their moms going through that, so I think sometimes explaining to them, you know that sometimes they don't have money. To give them what they want, but because you know I have bills to pay. Instead of to say no, I don't have it, or just. Getting frustrated I just need to explain to them like you know i'm sorry, but like I have responsibilities and maybe them understanding, I have bills to pay them, they would take know a little bit more than just me being you know say no. yeah we're getting frustrated with them."
177.0,Provider,"yeah or if they give an allowance it's a real good like object lesson. yeah $5. And they go to the store and they spend it and you say open your wallet do you have any money left and i'm like no. Okay, so if you wanted to go in the store pick anything up, could you buy it look in your wallet this you know so that's not always mommy situation not saying that mom his wallet is empty but. there's moments he doesn't just appear automatically so we're going to need restraint. and see that sometimes we have to say no to certain things so that we can you know how things within our reach it up and I learned about savings and discipline."
12952.0,Patient,"And then I think just accepting the fact of saying no it's Okay, I think that's the key right there is i'm. realizing that sometimes saying, though isn't hurtful to others, because I think sometimes they worry too much like if if I say no, then i'm going to hurt their feelings or. they're going to feel sad or they're going to. You know I think I worry too much about that so that's what gets me to just want to. give in and say, yes, even though I know in my heart, I can do it, but um I think i'm working on that, so it was a relief."
177.0,Provider,"Because they make it sad and they have every right to get sad right want to be able to allow people to talk about being authentic right, so you kids are sad. i'm sad you're sad I get it, but hey it is what it is you allow them to feel that emotion that temporary discomfort. short term discomfort for long term benefits, because when they become adults they're going to be telling the story how your tongue my mom used to say no, but it helped me it was helpful that she told me down. So we have to sometimes considered the short term discomfort to experience long term benefits. And I solely believe as a parent it's our responsibility. To do that for kids they have to do sometimes."
12952.0,Patient,"Right and I never believed either that like tough love is. Like sometimes kids want like that tough love and I never understood like i'm like I would always think when I was young, like a younger mother, you know when they first had my kids like. Like how would they you know want tough love like how do kids how would they even want that, like, but they do like they want discipline, they want structure, they want. They don't always want to be, you know they don't want things handed to them all the time, like and i'm speaking just for maybe my kids, but I think they've already been to the point where they've had everything and we're spoiled and then now they're like well what else. Can we get or have like we have everything you know so they like the discipline and structure. yeah sometimes. mm hmm."
177.0,Provider,Well we're about to wrap up So what are some of your takeaways but so many things you made me reflect on after our session.
12952.0,Patient,i'm writing just making that list and then maybe we can discuss it or next edition.
177.0,Provider,"yeah yeah. For sure i'm like really wants to hear your thoughts about that and. what's because those are two extremes to feel depression in a day worry at night, you know those are different emotions, those are tapping on different receptors in the brain. Deletion defect chemical so i'm curious to know what are the things that's occurring that produces these emotions or experiences for you."
12952.0,Patient,Okay.
177.0,Provider,"So I do have the 20th, which is, I know where i'm a bi weekly schedule right that's insane it's not cheap for six o'clock."
12952.0,Patient,"Okay. tomorrow, Wednesday okay. Work for me i'm 6pm my time right mountain time."
177.0,Provider,"Yes, yes."
12952.0,Patient,Okay yeah that'll work.
177.0,Provider,"Okay, great site for that um that makes us and um. But maybe for still showing up."
12952.0,Patient,"Oh yeah. Thank you for taking me, I appreciate it. Sorry, I missed the last couple of sessions."
177.0,Provider,For problem does happy you're here. Think about the best way you want to communicate your needs to the doctor as well and. If you're uncomfortable. short term discomfort for long term benefits. Give push through it okay.
12952.0,Patient,Okay bye. Have a good day.
177.0,Provider,You too bye.
