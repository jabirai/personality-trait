383.0,Provider,How are you. Oh can't quite hear you.
15605.0,Patient,The usual you know same as usual.
383.0,Provider,"Okay, to. not sure I know fully what the usual is. So could you maybe tell me what what how, what is the usual for you."
15605.0,Patient,"i'm a lot of positive a lot of negative, at the same time. Like I know how to count my blessings but. there's a lot of work that needs to be done and it's a lot of pressure. And I need help with it and people aren't like you know that willing to help, and I feel pretty isolated."
383.0,Provider,Okay.
15605.0,Patient,I have health and I have. A car and I like I have stuff to work with so i'm thankful for it.
383.0,Provider,Okay well that's good i'm sure we just kind of talk a little bit through some of the difficulties that you're experiencing.
15605.0,Patient,yeah sure whatever you feel whatever you feel like talking about.
383.0,Provider,"Okay well our last appointment, you were looking at this property in. Texas, and we talked about that at great length, a decision that you were sort of pending decision that you're going to make so I just wanted to check in with you about that Where are you with with that particular situation."
15605.0,Patient,"um I don't know if I checked in with you, but I like after I went and checked it out, but I took a road trip to Texas, to go."
383.0,Provider,I talked to you after that.
15605.0,Patient,"Okay, oh yeah because it was during the road trip that I was supposed to talk to you that's right. So the guy said he was going to work with me and I haven't got an email or text from him so it might have fallen through so i'm I might not be able to get it. i'm waiting on it, but at this point i'm going to start looking elsewhere. Because it's been a few weeks and. it's not really a piece of land, I want to pursue. So, if he doesn't want to like. If he doesn't feel like giving it then I don't really you know and that's fine with me i'll go try to find something better."
383.0,Provider,"Okay okay well i'm so. So that's some that's change and that. seems reasonable. Where are you in this relationship, you mentioned, also in that session that you had gotten back together with your girlfriend. That had you know with what you've had some of these domestic. issues where is that right now."
15605.0,Patient,"i'm not good, she did it again the same exact thing after like this time was bad because. Well, it wasn't like as bad as it was when all that happened, but it was bad in terms of hurting me because. She was actually ready to start a family with me this time and we were working on it, because we know each other in and out like we know each other back and forth, and she said she was finally ready, this time. To like not do that. And then we got in like a petty argument and I just wanted to make sure that we were not going to have that same thing happened again. And she just didn't respond at all, which is what leads to my mental. illness coming out on her is when she just can't even. have anything to save for everything that she just told me, which is. Like I promise you like, I know, when I did, and I promise you that i'm going to try everything I can to not do it, and then sitting there and just doing it right in front of me. After like we were good for a couple of weeks, this time, and we were really honest, this time, and we were really working on it and then. We were even ready to start having that kid and start moving in together. And maybe that was just too much and maybe that's just like she just kept saying things. And that's what I don't understand about people because it doesn't click in my mind that people can just say things without meeting them. And so, she said, all those things, and I know she meant it somewhere, but then the next day she didn't mean it and then the next day she doesn't mean it and so she has like really severe issues with that and then that just makes me really sad and alone like she just abandoned me again."
383.0,Provider,uh huh. uh how long ago was that that that she abandoned to you.
15605.0,Patient,"Probably last weekend, so a week or week and a half."
383.0,Provider,"uh huh. and But well. Looking at it from this perspective that you have now are you still really kind of mainly experiencing the pain of of having her separate from you, once again, or are you."
15605.0,Patient,"i'm just in shock and. Like it doesn't make sense to me that people aren't honest because i'm honest I don't understand how people say shit. without thinking about it, and without meaning it. It doesn't make sense to me because it's not how my brain works, and I know everybody's brain works different some people go out and kill people, some people. I don't get it, why would you kill something for no reason it doesn't make sense to me I don't want us I don't want to be compassionate with the psychopath like I don't want to understand. In my mind that she's just not okay so like just lying to somebody it's one of those things and it's not on the same level. at all, but it's like just one of those things that's wrong you shouldn't lie, especially about wanting to start a family about your love and wanting to move in and after everything you've done to me sending me to jail that's wrong that's just wrong."
383.0,Provider,"mm hmm. Well, are you resolved that the relationships over."
15605.0,Patient,"know her, she gets here like. and I don't think she wants it to end the same exact way that it has over and over so I don't know she's gonna take some time and then probably we're going to get our shit and hopefully say goodbye, I guess, I don't know. I don't know you. see what happens."
383.0,Provider,"well. I think that. Well, perhaps i'll ask you a couple other questions. How are you doing with regards to the alcohol use are you still."
15605.0,Patient,"On. I was planning on quitting in December. But I was drinking pretty heavy on beer not like I guess not pretty heavy but pretty consistently before December and so when December hit I wasn't able to I was able to for like a week and a half. And then ellie goes getting cravings that whole time. and other stuff was going on in my life and. So I took a minute and did some meditating and talking to your universe or talking to God and whatever you want to call it your inner self. mm hmm um before I drink and I asked it, you know. Should I is it all right. What should I do right now and it said just get your shit together you already know that you know you got to get healthy just do it, you know don't do it all at once, you don't have to do it tonight you don't have to do it into summer now have a beer it's not a big deal it just like. quit putting it off quit making excuses, you know you got to do it and so. I had beer that night after that, or if I think I didn't even have beer that night. I was planning on it, and then I just didn't. And then about like a week later, I think I had beer. And then so since then, I mean it's only been two weeks so it's only been like once or twice. And I plan on quitting in January for good on alcohol for at least a year so i'm planning on taking without it. And I think this time since it's not like consistent drinking to nothing it's more like okay he's an off it and then ready to start I think i'll be able to easier."
383.0,Provider,Are you talking about this group. That.
15605.0,Patient,"yeah last time I checked in. um. I mean, I was completely honest, but I don't know if it even got around to me because sometimes we don't have enough time for everybody to talk. So i'm not really. And I don't really have a great memory either so i'm not really sure what I talked about, but if it did come around to me, I would let them know for sure i'm not gonna be dishonest about it."
383.0,Provider,"Okay okay well, thank you for your honesty and sharing that you, you, you know. have been drinking a little bit. appreciate that."
15605.0,Patient,"yeah and if it was a bit like I think that, on my road to recovery and health i'm pretty aware, and I think that I can fit those couple beers in in December, while still maintaining on track. i'm pretty confident in that. i'm pretty confident that I have the right track in my head and i'm ready to take it out, especially because i'm getting a job now, which is going to get me off the couch."
383.0,Provider,yeah tell me about your your job search and what how's that going.
15605.0,Patient,"So I was updating my resume with express temp agency. So I was calling them to get the dates that I worked for them and. I just let them know that I was looking for work, no."
383.0,Provider,mm hmm.
15605.0,Patient,"They did like a little on the spot interview right there just determining what my new qualifications are and what i'm looking for now. mm hmm and then a couple days later, the guy that usually hooks me up said he has a landscaping job for 18 bucks an hour full time."
383.0,Provider,uh huh.
15605.0,Patient,"Pretty close to where I live, so I was like oh yeah sounds like something i'll do."
383.0,Provider,uh huh.
15605.0,Patient,"I just don't like looking I could probably find something that pays better. Maybe, something that gets me more active and it's healthier more fulfilling but at the same time with me I kind of just settled with. What comes to me, so it sounds like it's going to work out, I had to interview seemed to go pretty well and then we're waiting on like my license to get checked. At least that's the way he told me so if the license gets checked i'm pretty sure that I got the job."
383.0,Provider,"Okay, is it a light landscaping job with the company or with it, is it."
15605.0,Patient,"Yes, it's an evergreen if you know murphy's market, and if you know humble the area um it's towards blue lake."
383.0,Provider,mm hmm so it's a company that we're basic attempt position I through the.
15605.0,Patient,"mill he's looking for a foreman so he's looking for somebody to even look over the guys that are there so um because his he's a guy that usually does that drives a water truck during the summer. And so, he wants me around to do that in the summer well his guys doing the water truck because there's other guy doesn't have a license. So there's about five guys on the crew it's not a big company, but we just go around for commercial businesses and basically trim hedges and pick up trash. We don't have the market on link building that's a different company Miller farms, they own the dirt and they own the gravel so they make the money on like actual landscaping and all we do is like maintain commercial businesses."
383.0,Provider,"mm hmm okay. So that's do you feel kind of good about that, but you might."
15605.0,Patient,"Remember, I remember i'm at the mail, I was telling you I felt bad because I was dumping oil in the ground and this job will be able to be picking up plastic. So it's like the opposite, I was telling the guy That, too, I was like that'll be a lot easier on me just on my conscience. Good in a way that's cleaner."
383.0,Provider,uh huh and do you have any problems with your license or do you think that that's going to be.
15605.0,Patient,"go through Okay, I mean just like speeding tickets and. crap that's old so i'm pretty sure it'll be cool."
383.0,Provider,"Okay, are you going to follow up with them, just to see where things are at."
15605.0,Patient,"yeah I guess it was like last Friday, or something I might want to check in with them, I was kind of just gonna he's a pretty cool guy so it's kind of just going to give them space i'm I hit him up tomorrow, though, and. Just check in and see if he's still waiting on it and, if not go look somewhere else go find something else."
383.0,Provider,"Okay well yeah I think that I think it's sometimes it's good to just check in see let them know you're you're interested, you know."
15605.0,Patient,"yeah definitely i'll probably do that, tomorrow, just to see if maybe he's still waiting on it today, or something."
383.0,Provider,mm hmm. um and so has your overall mood been kind of down and depressed you seem a little bit down today I don't know if that's.
15605.0,Patient,"yeah it's been pretty bad the past few days. I have a lot like I said it's complicated with me, I have a lot of hopeful i'm hopeful part of me, and then I have a part that's a beast to manage and it's just like. Just keeps me down. and"
383.0,Provider,know that the part that is the beast is that. You want to talk a little bit more about that part of you.
15605.0,Patient,"it's, just like the monkey on your back man it's The thing that stops you from being the best version of yourself, right now, so there's like. Your ideal version of yourself, and some people already met it, and if you manage it that's great and then you don't have a beast, but if you don't meet your own standards. Then there's a gap between you and what you want to be, and then that weighs on you and that's the beast it's like i'm not i'm not doing right. and none of us are so it's like I feel in with me i'm not a localized conscience person like I feel the weight of other people that i'm around in. The Community i'm around because I am that I feel we all are, and I feel none of us are individual we all inherit each other's ideas we all inherit each other's thoughts in a way. So I feel like we're all hurting and that's the beast like we all could do better, and I know it starts with me because i'm in control of my body i've been over this a million times with people, but like. It does weigh on me, the fact that we're all kind of just stuck. And I am too. i'm really hard like i'm trying to get. Through that gap and get to where I want to be. Like setback, because I keep getting support right i'll get support with people like my kind of who support me and then. My mom support me and then we'll get in like arguments over. Like. misunderstanding and then. That just tears it all down and i'm just alone again."
383.0,Provider,Okay. For the purposes of this appointment and meaning that mental health. appointments. sessions with therapists are really to address your individual. thoughts and what. You can do you know how I can help you to empower yourself to do what you want to do for yourself.
15605.0,Patient,"Well, I was wondering, do you think like maybe a Community based approach to mental health, might be more effective, because if you're just talking to one person over and over. What if they have the same issues like at some point. Maybe we all work, like all your patients and all your. Colleagues, get together in a group."
383.0,Provider,"Well that's why we have group therapy, I mean group therapy is really, really effective and I really believe in group therapy and then there's. One on one on one therapy so it's different approaches, you know working individually with people and then coming together as a group, and I don't have you as. You know I run other groups and you're not in my other groups, but you do have a group and that's part of the treatment, but part of the treatment is one on one. So. that's where we really."
15605.0,Patient,"You know just shooting ideas around I was thinking like what if there was cuz group therapy is about 10 people or so and that's helpful for sure. I was thinking like what if there was communities of mental health like like collaboration kind of where 50 people get together and share ideas and comfort each other, you know."
383.0,Provider,"Right right well there, there is a history of that but I don't want to go into that in this appointment with you, because then we're just sort of speaking about. The history of mental health and different approaches and you know that's kind of a different topic than. Talking about your specific experience and what you're specifically struggling with and I, you know a little bit of my experience with you is that that's kind of a hard area to for you to space for you to go to."
15605.0,Patient,What.
383.0,Provider,Talking about your own personal struggles your own individual struggles.
15605.0,Patient,That I just told you about them.
383.0,Provider,"You told me about him, and you, but when we start to go more into it there's a little bit of a sidestep to kind of discussing more globalized you know well, how are we approaching this in terms of so I just want to kind of recalibrate calibrate back to you and."
15605.0,Patient,"It is extremely difficult, because I feel i'm in a stew I don't feel like i'm a carrot on a cutting board i'm already chopped up and stuck in this do. So I am the outside world like I am heard of it, I can't make that separation I don't know why people do it doesn't make sense to me like right now i'm speaking to you and you're speaking to me and we're influencing each other. And that's how life works with everyone you talk to you and I know that. Everyone draws that line because it's your person and it's like your place in time and there's that illusion, but at the same time we wouldn't be the people we were if we didn't talk to each other."
383.0,Provider,yeah so.
15605.0,Patient,"be the people that we were if we never met so we have to adapt to the surroundings and that becomes who we are, we are in a studio."
383.0,Provider,"right but back to your point of agency, you have personal agency, you have personal well, and you have your own personal you know experience growing up, and so it is more a personal type of work when you're working one on one with someone. So you know. that's that's the that's what we're here to do is to to address your your individual feelings of depression. and"
15605.0,Patient,i'm just trying to describe that I can't separate like my individual feelings of depression come from that from not me it's not from me that's what i'm trying to explain i'm just tapping into it it's there.
383.0,Provider,"Okay, so do you feel like it's more of you're tapping into just general feelings of depression in your community and that's how you're that's why you're experiencing your own your depression."
15605.0,Patient,"that's a it's a good way to put it it's not all that it's not all the Community, but it is a huge part of it if that was not. as bad as it was then I would be able to set my own path right and I understand that there is your path the path of the outside world, and I could do anything in between, but at the same time I can't like I can't just. Post up in the middle of town, you know what I mean so there's certain things you can and can't do within the confines of this environment which shape who you are. So you're kind of in a way, and this is a philosophical debate to is just like if you even have free will, in the first place, or if you're just a product of your surroundings and I think that when you address your own mental issues. You should make sure, and like try to track them to where they come from So for me it's not all from eddie like I didn't just come up with this stuff it was inherited I grew up in this messed up world that mess my mind."
383.0,Provider,"So the thing is, is that there's. The freedom to. Free free agency, meaning that you have. We all have a responsibility to make our own choices and."
15605.0,Patient,"live according to your philosophical debate that's not even true but, like. Some people, a lot of people like smart businesses, they think that free will doesn't even exist, the way that most people think it does. it's just like let's."
383.0,Provider,stay out of the I want to speak with you about what your beliefs are do you fully feel you do not have free agency to make your own.
15605.0,Patient,"like that. that's like it's not just me like that's a huge section of philosophy is people that don't believe in free will, because it doesn't make sense."
383.0,Provider,"So ED Edward I want them to know. What are your beliefs, do you believe you do not have free will."
15605.0,Patient,"that's what i'm trying to explain it's like a whole beliefs, is not just me yeah like that's the way it makes sense in my mind it's like asking if you're you know Christian or Jewish it's not it's not this like abstract belief that nobody does this is like a well known argument."
383.0,Provider,i'm not.
15605.0,Patient,"I do, I do believe in it yeah that's The short answer is yeah. And i'm."
383.0,Provider,"Very well, you don't believe you have free well."
15605.0,Patient,"Yes, and i'm not the only one that's what i'm trying to explain."
383.0,Provider,"I don't really like I said i'm not I don't need to be explained about. Other people right now okay I don't need an explanation or philosophical foundation of others, I want to know about you, I want to know what you think. I just like an opportunity to speak. When you wake up in the morning, do you feel you do not have free will to make choices about how you're going to live your day."
15605.0,Patient,"yeah and it may you like, when you frame it the way that you said it's like you said it's like a given and there's something wrong with me for thinking that I don't. i'm not sure i'm just asking a question. I don't know no one does I don't think any of us do. I think it's Okay, I think, when you go to I don't think any of us do and."
383.0,Provider,"What other people think or don't think that is to me a bit of a sidestep it's a bit avoided it's a bit not really, really like taking yourself to to to task to really."
15605.0,Patient,Wake up like that I don't think we have free will. And then i'm.
383.0,Provider,well. none of it up in the morning.
15605.0,Patient,"No, I don't. And I don't think any. creature of existence determines what happens to it. Okay, including myself."
383.0,Provider,"So you don't have a choice in the morning, when you wake up as to if you're going to have a what you're going to plan to do with your day you don't."
15605.0,Patient,know the ego does it's a really complex. argument it's about what you are fundamentally.
383.0,Provider,we're not in a philosophic a philosophy class. This is not a problem any.
15605.0,Patient,Questions that don't have simple answers.
383.0,Provider,"This. yeah i'm trying to have a conversation, but you seem to want to go to a place where we're going to have these sort of global philosophical. debate."
15605.0,Patient,"Yes or no on like really complex issues, so if you're asking me if I have any choices it's like the ego does, but the, the body and the soul dog. it's a complex topic and you're I don't know i'm trying to explain it in like it feels like i'm saying the wrong thing that's why i'm trying to defend it."
383.0,Provider,"And when we go into that place of. Defending a position, a defending, which is what i'm what i'm feeling that we're going into a debate or an argument and i'm wondering if this is happening in your other relationships as well. Because it's."
15605.0,Patient,"Like you framed it. You do have the choice and then, and then you asked me whether or not I believed it so it's like there's a disagreement there and then you made it seem like not having a choice is the wrong answer so yeah I mean that's what happens in my life, and I feel that I can perceive that."
383.0,Provider,What happens in your life.
15605.0,Patient,When when. When people don't like listen to me there's speed bumps in the conversation.
383.0,Provider,Are you listening to other people.
15605.0,Patient,i'm trying and then i'm trying to explain my answer when they asked me a question and then it's like hard to explain when. They don't want to hear it.
383.0,Provider,To while it's just maybe we can just put that on pause and I can ask you some other questions related to your goals that we talked about a couple of weeks ago.
15605.0,Patient,You can ask me whatever you want to i'm trying to answer the best. answer I can give us.
383.0,Provider,We had talked about. You keeping a calendar of things that you know need to do and. And endeavoring to kind of attend to those week a weekly schedule or daily schedule and you showed me the things that you had up the way you had done not overdoing it on a white using a whiteboard. Are you still doing that you still using that to kind of keep track of things.
15605.0,Patient,i'm not as much.
383.0,Provider,We had also talked about the fact that sometimes you kind of go to going into the video games and. Because it's just maybe it's a habit or it's just this wondering where you're at with kind of going into the online video gaming world during the day if that's something that's still like taking up time are. Were with that.
15605.0,Patient,yep it is.
383.0,Provider,Do you feel what was that.
15605.0,Patient,Taking up a lot of time.
383.0,Provider,"How much time, do you think you're on there, and how do you feel about the time that you're using or that is taking."
15605.0,Patient,"I don't feel like anyone who gives a shit what I do. I don't feel anyone supports me. And I don't want to be the only one that cares about what I do. And so, because of that I just fill the day with bullshit. that's how I feel about it."
383.0,Provider,"Okay. Well that's a very, very powerful statement that you just said. And it's. Painful it's a painful. Reality, I think. So do some ideas. When we don't feel supported by others, or we don't feel like other people care about us. One way of. Dealing with that as either repairing. relationships or healing relationships. Where we that we've already started start had you know, like, with your mom and so forth. And or reaching out through our work to. connect with other people and trying to help other people and be supportive of them."
15605.0,Patient,"I don't like them. don't like anybody man everybody's been disappointing me. anytime I get close to somebody besides, maybe two people. They disappoint me. um I don't think any human is a good role model for me growing up, I didn't grow up with any role models on TV like bad people were told to be good people like. The rappers and shit. there's very few good people, and I want supportive good people, but I don't like the people that are around. I think there's something wrong with people right now. they're like not honest. And I think that. lazy. incapable, and like. Just weak minded not thinking about what's happening. And I think that i'm not much better, but at least I can tell that this shift is happening and I don't know how to fix it, which makes it so that i'm not fucking guy that can sit there and tell everybody they're full of shit, but I can say hey it's time guys time to stop the npc position."
383.0,Provider,"well. We can only really control ourselves, we so in that stepping forward to. create a more positive world if we work on ourselves. To be more caring to be supportive to be provide unconditional you know. positive encouragement to other people. You, you may feel better yourself."
15605.0,Patient,"I find that it backfires because I try really hard and then I get close to people. And they see that I try really hard they see that I want what's good in the world, and they fall in love with that within the minute I see them not train. And just failing and I call him out, then it falls they can't hear that, and so I can't be around people that don't try, so they they like me for trying, but they don't like when I am like well why aren't you with me like, why are you with me or no, are you with me on. that's where it falls apart and. I know that I can be more supportive and have people with me, but I don't want those people with me, because if they're not with me on their own volition. that's like that's what i'm talking about these people don't want to take the step themselves, and so I just feel so alone trying to take that step."
383.0,Provider,"Well, sometimes if we. expect less of others, but more of ourself. Things things can move more in in a good direction. You feel alone you feel uncared for you feel you say you feel. that nobody cares and you feel unsupported and so you spend a lot of your day on video in video games in the video gaming world, which you know, is just kind of a time you know time. waster are. it's kind of a waste of time it's not moving you in the direction of productive life and so. You know if you felt. My my feeling is that if you. felt better about how you're showing up for the world. and other people. Without having expectations of how other people should show up. But really giving getting the microscope back on yourself and asking yourself how am I showing up for others, and for this world that you say that you really deeply care."
15605.0,Patient,"um here's what happens I do look, I have tried to reach out and i've tried to bridge that alarm and i'm like I talked to people and. I tell them my ideas and I tell them what I want to do and people can only handle half of what I have to say, depending on who they are, because of the extremes, so I become the enemy immediately, what I want to do, most people are like that's a bad thing. I don't think I don't want that, for the world you're a bad man that's like they want like freedom man, I want the freedom to go to the grocery store and i'm being dehumanized. Being wish death upon and being."
383.0,Provider,Who is dehumanizing you and wish.
15605.0,Patient,"Right House sent out a memo saying for the vaccinated good luck. For the unvaccinated you're going to die, and then you have like New York Times thing it's time to shun the on vaccinated any of Austria and Germany is saying we're going to lock you in prison if you don't take this and i'm saying. i'm concerned about heart issues may stay away from me. And people are like you're a bad guy for wanting people to stay away from you."
383.0,Provider,"So, are you are we discussing a conflict of thinking regarding the vaccination is that is that what. Because I think our long time before that, because. again."
15605.0,Patient,Again again.
383.0,Provider,"Edward Edward. We need to keep the conversation i'm going to need to pull you back to. Are we discussing you and your differing opinion about vaccination, now that means a lot of different things. The mentality."
15605.0,Patient,And that's like one issue but it started.
383.0,Provider,"A one car without one issue, I can only if you do me the favor I can only. I prefer to just like let's open up this I know it's connected to all of these things and that's fine, we can go down the road but let's just thoroughly discuss if right now you're feeling alienated in part due to the vaccine mandate. and your beliefs about that, and how that's impacting your interaction with people in the Community. Is that is, that is, that part of what's going on right now."
15605.0,Patient,or what's going on right now.
383.0,Provider,"Okay, so can you so. You are feeling alienated because you're don't believe that the vaccine for you, you don't want to take it, and just maybe you can fill me in on your."
15605.0,Patient,"I was told it was a good idea, before they were able to tell me it's a good idea, based off the data and the data is coming out showing it's probably not a good idea for me and they don't care. Like I couldn't go to a doctor and get."
383.0,Provider,An idea for you. To get vaccinated.
15605.0,Patient,What.
383.0,Provider,"Is that what you're saying it's that it's not a good idea for you personally to get the vaccine for yourself. Okay, and that is due to health, health issues that you've had."
15605.0,Patient,"A million things I mean like I said, these things you really want to pinpoint them, but there is a bass network, this is the beast inside of my head like it's not one thing so it's not. I don't want it to not take it, for one reason, the whole thing smelled like crap from the beginning, and I look into CIA propaganda. This is what I look into and it smelled of that immediately and now it's pretty down clear that there's a different something else going on it's about the ID. So the digital ID they want to make sure that you comply or else you don't get your food and your your money. that's what's happening and I don't want to be a part of this new system that's The main reason they're putting out a new system. that's like non human it's like against life they're going to commodified life and make you pay for the air man rivers. going to commodified under the guise of saving the planet they're not going to do shit about the pollution. And they're going to make your body isn't all their property and if you don't let them do what they want you don't get to be part of society that's insane regardless of whether or not the vaccine works holy shit."
383.0,Provider,"Okay, so so i'm seeing a bit of what you're thinking is going going on and your perspective about what's going on and in the world, and how that's impacting your mental health individually."
15605.0,Patient,"yeah I mean it's not just started i've been crazy, since I started looking into what the hell is actually going on. They call me crazy and I was like. you're not only crazy you're a playground and you're a threat to society and we got to get rid of you. Do just because i'm like criticizing these people should do."
383.0,Provider,"So, who has been saying that you're crazy what where does that lead."
15605.0,Patient,"to know. news. The news is saying i'm a moron crazy conspiracy theorists Q and on supporting a terrorist yeah they're saying all sorts of shit about me and they're. Like the people that are supposed to tell us about you know the weather and they're telling telling people that hate me it's crazy and not it like reverberates through society I just feel it around. Like I hear people talk in and I talk to people and it's like one side is foaming at the mouth that i'm. I need to get like gone and the other side is dumb man those guys are so dumb that support what I support they're like. Oh, and also, we should like put a bounty on women for abortion like we should just start suing them for getting this treatment and like possibly given their kid a better life, whatever like. fucking I just feel ridiculousness all over and like nobody's sitting down to have a rational conversation that's what it feels like. Before we do these crazy sweeping mandates and these insane laws bounty is like nobody sitting down and just flushing it out, and if they are it's not getting covered people are just like button heads."
383.0,Provider,"mm hmm.

An a good for breakfast that you have some goals for your own life and that you can step forward with the sunshine and the trees and and. The the life that you have that there is. A. good reason for you to have your life and to make your own choices antics have your own good experiences and your own you know positive exchanges with people. Irrespective of of these things that are going on. And because there's many. I think there's there's there's still opportunity in your life and in my life, to have a good day and to decide how we're going to make it a good day you know just for ourselves. And in in stepping out in into our life with some peace and with some gladness. That that's that's a positive contribution. And to. You know, to pursue. A good life, you know."
15605.0,Patient,So.
383.0,Provider,As you're able to create it day by day.
15605.0,Patient,"So just because I don't have agency over whether or not i'm saying this word of that word doesn't mean I can't feel fulfillment. It doesn't mean it's empty it's I don't want that agency, the Agency is a lie it's like you're not doing the right thing, no you're."
383.0,Provider,"doing what i'm saying is the Agency to. to choose to have oatmeal the Agency to you know by a flower or pick some flowers or or have a plant in your apartment in your in your. You know and keep it alive, and you know, create some nice things like the art that's behind you there I don't know if you make created that art but. You know the ability to do art, the ability to write a poem the ability to pick up the phone and say hi to your mom asked her how she's doing, these are all things that. That are small things, but perhaps rewarding things that you can bring into your life, and you have that power to do it, you also have the power to to. To do. Things that are you know hurtful and harmful to yourself and others, so you know what, what do you choose to do when you wake up in the morning."
