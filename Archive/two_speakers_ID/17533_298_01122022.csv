No one seemed no one ever. thought it was necessary."
298.0,Provider,I do you have any abuse or trauma in your background.
17533.0,Patient,Well um my my mom's family were like. Have you ever seen the show shameless.
298.0,Provider,No.
17533.0,Patient,"Oh yeah well it's like this, this Irish family and it's like likes there were two brothers two sisters in like a tiny house, this is my mom's family and they just would her parents would just drink and argue all the time. and My grandpa he died. When I was a baby. And so my mom's older brother, I think he kind of like. felt a little guilty about. So he ended up like like living with my grandma for the rest of her life, like he never moved out but. I think it was like part of mix of like failure to launch and also like wanting to stay and take care of his mom because. His dad left. But he in turn kind of just became her drinking partner. And so they became the ones to like get drunk and argue. And so I you know, like, I was around a lot of this because my grandma would babysit me when I was a little kid and. and And when I was a baby. The same thing was kind of starting to happen with my dad like he would go out to work, and then go out drinking after work and then my mom would have to like go and chase him down at a bar. or like he'd come home late and then they'd get into like shouting matches they were never really physical, I think you know my mom's family, like her brother and, like her dad and her her mom were. And like would get into like you know, like pushing matches and stuff but um that never happened at my house, but it was a lot of shouting and screaming matches and stuff for a long time, when I was a little kid. But. After I don't know what happened but eventually that that stopped."
298.0,Provider,Have you had any surgeries.
17533.0,Patient,I had an appendectomy on like 2008 or 2009 I want to say okay.
298.0,Provider,Have you ever been on mental health medicines. Do you feel like you're a disorganized person.
17533.0,Patient,I feel like I am now I feel like I wasn't and like I said and maybe the last five to seven years I just I don't feel nearly as like. put together as I used to. So it's hard for me to answer that because it's like I don't feel like myself. lately.
298.0,Provider,You know what that might be attributed to.
17533.0,Patient,"Like I said i'm I am assuming ADHD is part of it, and maybe just you know, like being depressed being stuck inside for two years. That kind of thing."
298.0,Provider,gotcha. Is there anything i've not asked that would be really good to know about you.
17533.0,Patient,um. I don't know I.
298.0,Provider,"can't think of anything okay that's Okay, what are your eating habits and your sleeping habits."
17533.0,Patient,"i'm sleeping I always I try and get eight hours, if I can usually it's like somewhere between six and eight hours of sleep a night. I try and keep a pretty regular like. Wake up at the same time, go to bed around the same time, but. that's definitely since like the holidays and stuff and i've been off work. With that, like i've been staying up later and sleeping in and stuff so my schedules, been a little all over the place lately but generally i'm. sleep is a big priority for me. And then eating. Since I used to be a chef I like to cook, so I do a lot of cooking at home and and that, too, I. I trainee pretty healthy, you know I buy organic food and. You know, try and get plenty of vegetables and all of that kind of stuff."
298.0,Provider,Okay.
17533.0,Patient,"And I know like usually one of the first things i'll ask myself when I start feeling like not well like, be it physically or mentally is like have you eaten today have you have you had enough water, you know, so I. I i'm aware of the like how important it is to to eat and sleep and drink water."
298.0,Provider,"Okay, good how much exercise, do you get."
17533.0,Patient,"i'm not as much as i'd like my job is pretty physically demanding but as far as like intentional. exercise. I try and do like a half hour like three times a week, if I can."
298.0,Provider,Okay.
17533.0,Patient,"And that wasn't that's like a newer thing because I was definitely like Okay, if I if i'm feeling anxious and depressed and like. You know i'm having trouble concentrating like Maybe I should start with the very obvious stuff like you know really focus on sleeping and eating well and drinking water and exercising and see if that starts to help you know."
298.0,Provider,"Do you use any substances alcohol nicotine caffeine. Yes, heroin what he is."
17533.0,Patient,"I smoked cigarettes, for a very long time, but I quit a couple of years ago, but every once in a while i'll get an urge to smoke again. So sometimes I will. But. And then I drink pretty regularly. that's something that. i'd like to cut back on. And I. Use cannabis regularly and both of those things I feel like. I feel like I am not. Like sometimes i'll just stop using either one for like long periods of time, but I feel like they're. Like they're crutches for me for like the anger like anxiety."
298.0,Provider,or like.
17533.0,Patient,um. And yeah I just I see them as. Just something I use more frequently than I care to.
298.0,Provider,me eating disorders in your background. Do you have anxiety.
17533.0,Patient,I believe I do.
298.0,Provider,"and tell me more about your anxiety, do you know your triggers what does it feel like to panic attacks."
17533.0,Patient,"um. I. I think work was a really big trigger for me on this was working in kitchens like I used to get really nervous before going in to work, even if it was a place, I had always like I had been for years. I just always felt like I was nervous like it was the first day every single day, you know and. And I like had a really hard hard time like leaving things at work like if there would be you know, like a big event the next day or something like I wouldn't be able to sleep because of you know, like just being worried about it. Like maybe you know is everything did we get everything done is it gonna go Okay, you know if somebody's not going to show up. And so. yeah I feel like you know that was one of that's one of the reasons. Like I feel like I drink so frequently was like i'd be really nervous. About work and just being there and kind of stressed out all day, and so it was always. You know, like you'd get off work and want to drink a beer, because I was so amped up all day."
