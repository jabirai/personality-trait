416.0,Provider,"No, no, nothing."
14943.0,Patient,"it's hard to London. yeah i've never used it before, so it took me a little bit of time figure it out."
416.0,Provider,"yeah you're not alone i'm kind of used to it a lot of times, people have have a learning curve. especially my neighbors come on."
14943.0,Patient,"With my daughter was here she would have been you know my tech support, but I was just completely confused."
416.0,Provider,"Well, you seem to be doing just fine."
14943.0,Patient,yeah we're working on it.
416.0,Provider,"So we're scheduled for what's called a bio psychosocial, which is a fancy way of saying that I just asked you a lot of questions and kind of get to know you and we sort of established some goals for therapy. So it's a little different than our normal session just because i'm going to get some background in history and that sort of thing on you. And then, of course, if you want to ask me any questions, if anything, comes up you're most welcome to do that. All right, so I did read your intake and I was looking at sounds like you were in the hospital for a couple days."
14943.0,Patient,"yeah I had it had these attacks anxiety attacks, since my daughter was born, she was born with what we thought was neurological issues. turns out she's autistic but I didn't really get a diagnosis for about a year and a half, and I was incredibly anxious had my first child, so my anxiety over medical things which seems to have a theme that when there's a medical issue, this time with her that I. just got overwhelmed and it all it's like the distraction I don't know if it's a distraction, but it all just kind of winds itself up into me obsessing like OCD about sleep. So."
416.0,Provider,"which, of course, then means can't."
14943.0,Patient,"Right right and with in with her it started going, you know oh my God i'm not gonna be able to sleep i'm not gonna be able to be a mother and I already have a possibly disabled child what am I going to do, etc, etc, so i'm. I saw psychiatrist and she put me. On paxil and xanax for. A couple months yeah."
416.0,Provider,"i've been how many years ago, is that."
14943.0,Patient,"A 2024 so i've been on 20 milligrams paxil for 24 years. She started me on 40 but then tied me down and i've been on and off the xanax. I got to the point now where i've only needed the xanax when i've when i've traveled or go somewhere so i've been pretty well functioning before I got sick with the Perry card itis my have been functioning, probably the best I had in my entire life and I felt really hopeful."
416.0,Provider,Okay that's good.
14943.0,Patient,Though.
416.0,Provider,"And then, so we know that there are things that work."
14943.0,Patient,"Yes, it's just the xanax didn't work, this time, so they tried trouser down that didn't work and then they added seroquel and that helped so. I now i'm one and a half pills of seroquel which I think is 150. And trezza down 200 I think and 20 milligrams of paxil. In addition to all the other drugs i'm taking for my incessant pericarditis."
416.0,Provider,tell me what pay card itis is.
14943.0,Patient,"inflammation of the sack around the pair of carpe diem it was a number of things can trigger it heart surgery. viral illnesses, the most common is like an enterovirus in my case, it was the vaccine and I had a terrible reaction to the second Pfizer shot and within three weeks I developed half a liter of fluid around my heart that I was going to die within an hour, so if they didn't drain it."
416.0,Provider,Oh wow.
14943.0,Patient,"yeah so I actually The night before they did the draining I was it was like I was connecting with my mom she's passed. And that was really wild almost like well i'm not afraid to die my mom's my mom's reaching out to me so that was a really wild I haven't I haven't actually. Stay awake if I fell asleep, just so because that's how I just felt I was close to death and they kept telling me oh it's just a virus, you have to tap it out. And so the next day, when I went to get my echocardiogram. That had been scheduled three weeks before they basically said you got to go in and have the emergency procedure get the fluid drained and I was in the hospital week with the fluid drain around my heart. And then. I got better in about three months, but I was given it's a very rare disease very rare illness I wasn't given the best information by the best cardiologist so I started to exercise again and I relapsed. got better. tried to get back out and do things tried to go back to work relapsed and. Then I relapsed. Every it was relaxing like once a month, so they finally put me on a new drug that's called Rolando sceptre Arc list, which is a. And it completely immunosuppressant you so I even though i've had the vaccine i'm my my interleukin system is basically been blocked. So that means the interleukin cascade which helps you fight off, especially viral illnesses is not functioning and they have to do that in order to stop what's called the auto immune process it's similar to gout except with your heart okay. yeah I understand and the, the only ultimate cure, for it is a Perry cardiac to me where it's open heart surgery they go in and they they take the pair of carpe diem from your heart."
416.0,Provider,And is that something you're considering.
14943.0,Patient,"I can't even think about it, right now, this way ilana SIP they've got me on i've got to keep working in order to pay for it, because it's $12,000 a dose."
416.0,Provider,"Oh, my gosh How often do you take it."
14943.0,Patient,once a week.
416.0,Provider,and insurance doesn't cover that.
14943.0,Patient,"They cut I pay $100 copay. So that's $400 but i'm medicare doesn't cover it so if I went on disability, I would have to pay for it out of pocket."
416.0,Provider,I say.
14943.0,Patient,"Okay it's a class for something something so my my work has been really good but i'm i'm expected to be back probably part time by February so right now i'm doing good i'm doing four hours a week, no for four hours a day, three times a week so it's a sitting i'm doing admin work. Okay, and i'm away from people. But pretty much if this stuff doesn't. is sometimes i've heard you're on this stuff for like two to three years so i'm just gonna have to take my chances but."

14943.0,Patient,"Okay, so I mean i'm. i'm in i'm having a lot of complicated medical issues right now."
416.0,Provider,"Okay, and then complicated medical issues, the medical issues themselves are the things that really trigger your anxiety. Yes, okay all right, and then so let's backtrack a little bit into your earlier years so tell me a little bit about who you grew up with where you grew up. Your childhood like."
14943.0,Patient,"A group in the sacramento area Davis dad was a dad my dad owned a shoe store and he was a functional alcoholic and my mom married my dad. Because her parents wanted her to so she told me, I never loved your dad and i'm like yeah no kidding like I can tell when I was growing up, and then I had a sister."
416.0,Provider,Who was that what did that look like him. functional alcoholic and.
14943.0,Patient,"Okay, he was a functional he went to work every day early in the morning for. He worked hard, we had food and. Things and clothing and we had a house to live in and then he would come home and start drinking and just fall asleep on the couch about 430 in the afternoon and we didn't take him up and I didn't have friends over."
416.0,Provider,Okay.
14943.0,Patient,"So he is and then my mom was taking care of her parents so she was always over at their house, and so my sister kind of she was five years older she kind of took care of me and, fortunately, she was very angry about the situation and she took it out on me. She enjoyed tormenting me mercilessly."
416.0,Provider,"What was what was that, like."
14943.0,Patient,"Well, like. This as early as I can remember, she was trying to hurt me like put my hand under a swing set that would smash my hand, you know if it went up and it's hard to describe that was just my earliest memory of her trying to train a smash my hand under a swing set."
416.0,Provider,Oh wow.
14943.0,Patient,"And she called me a fat queer constantly when I was a child, like anytime i'd even walked by her room she be like hey christy come in here and her friends would be there, this is when I was like maybe five. And she'd be like see I told you, she was a fat queer and then they'd all laugh, and she even wrote it all over the garage. And so the whole neighborhood could see it, it said, Chris Christie is a queer yeah I know I can't stand her, and it was all over the garage. And my mom didn't do anything about it, she was just overwhelmed and she was avoiding. Avoiding the whole situation just she was involved with her parents she had never detached from her family of origin, and she really didn't want to be married to my dad but her parents wanted her to we're talking depression era, my parents were older my dad was 51 when I was born. So they were just I mean what my mom said to me, was she I know she loved me, but she always said, you know I did what was expected of me. And I said Okay, you know so she was a bit cold. um but she did her job she considered it a job and she did her job. Okay, and. You know, we in my dad wasn't really involved with any aspects of our lives, other than providing. yeah and he was he had a terrible temper so you know if, like we weren't allowed to drink water during dinner if we did he would start yelling at us. to eat the food first and then drink the water, you know things like just. I would go to other people's houses and i'd be like. Okay what's wrong with my house. I knew there was something wrong. I just didn't know how to fix it and I wanted to fix it, I was always trying to be the pleaser."
416.0,Provider,What i'm. what's your relationship with your sister like now.
14943.0,Patient,"um she wants to try to have a relationship, but you know she made fun of me and and just tormented me up until I was in my 20s and she even recently, she said. isn't your life boring aren't you bored because your life so boring. So she's had her issues my mom ended up raising her child. And I call her an emotional surface. Peter she's not a deeply emotional person she just writes the surface of the waves."
416.0,Provider,"Okay, and it are your parents still."
14943.0,Patient,"I don't know I took I took care of my mom you know we came from a not a traditional Jewish family, but my mom was Jewish on her side. And she always she always said, you need to take care of your family, you need to take care of your parents, so I took care of her. The last 10 years of her life, she had some type of lung issue and idiopathic fibrosis. And so I took care of her I took every Friday off to take her to doctors appointments and make sure she was comfortable and you know she's just always complaining like. She wrote letters we found after she passed she wrote letters to her friends, saying that nobody had time for her, and then I didn't have time for her well, I was raising an autistic daughter."
416.0,Provider,So you have you have two kids.
14943.0,Patient,"No, I have one my my one daughter."
416.0,Provider,Just the one daughter okay and and so she's 24 I think you said wait.
14943.0,Patient,For.
416.0,Provider,It she's living with you so.
14943.0,Patient,"No she's I worked with her and the autism intervention Center at ready children's where I work. And I started investigating what programs would work that were double blind that have been successful and I found a program at rady children's where they did one on one with her for five hours a day when she was a year and a half. And it was through university California San Diego they did brain studies, she was part of an early study with Dr Eric or cheese about looking into seeing if these children could be paired with neurotypical children. And also, and also have one on one training, basically, I used to call it. cheesy cracker training like if she would do anything desire to get a cheesy cracker. And we found out that she had a very high IQ when she was in second grade she was doing fine you know she was. She was getting the point where she was starting to talk, which is really awesome and when she started to talk, it was in full sentences, so I had her in an IEP Program. And she was doing fine she had a huge sensory issues century issues blonde beyond belief and i'm beginning to think that I might be on the spectrum, because I have sensory issues as well and."
416.0,Provider,The more than have sensory issues with or without autism.
14943.0,Patient,"yeah more I look at her and the more I look at me and she's now been diagnosed as aspergers. I got her diagnosed in high school so she could qualify for some some. More time. long story short, with her is she's doing amazing she was in school, she graduated from university California Santa Cruz, with a double major and in our and a minor in Japanese and now she's in Japan teaching and she's on her own. You sound so proudest moment. of my life. I will see her in two years. So coven."
416.0,Provider,yeah you guys talk regularly.
14943.0,Patient,We facetime. yeah she's she's not a hugger you know she's not physical like she's her friends have taught her how to hug. But the fact that she's happy and she has friends and she can make friends and just never experienced the trauma that. I broke the cycle.
416.0,Provider,You sure did wow amazing okay.
14943.0,Patient,So really I think about her I miss her so much.
416.0,Provider,yeah I can only imagine my my kiddo just went away to college and i'm already like.
14943.0,Patient,"Oh, my God, I know it's here, well, I went up lot Santa Clara. Santa Cruz is close to close enough to San Diego so we we drove up and visited and she had her own dorm room we had accommodations for her because she needs to do her little OCD dancing around and touch walls. She likes to go around and she has a rituals. So anyway, she is i'm so proud of her, she doesn't know the the extent of my illness, because she gets really upset. So i'm just kind of told her you know i'm I didn't died and pass away i'm getting slowly getting better, which I am very slow, but this drug has enabled me to at least be able to go outside and go to work and and go to the grocery store without being exhausted. But what triggered this last event was that the drug really wasn't working for the first couple of weeks, and they had told me it would start working right away, and I had a relapse. yeah and I didn't feel like being around anymore, because that was the last drug before surgery before a surgery, but the 10% death rate. So that's what triggered it."
416.0,Provider,So you got really suicidal huh. yeah it wasn't just not sleeping it was. Not flipping anxiety.
14943.0,Patient,"I just didn't. I just thought if this drug isn't working yeah because to Dr different i've been seeing like three I see three doctors cardiologist rheumatologist and I had pushed so hard for this drug with them. Like they didn't know much about it, so I did do a lot of research and I actually had to present to them and say here talk to the doctor at the Cleveland clinic talk to the Skype. let's see if this can work and they said oh yeah it's gonna work like within five days and I went out to exercise and I just had a relapse. So it just needed more time to work I got onto Facebook and there's a there's a Perry card itis group on Facebook and a lot of them had said, you know, sometimes it takes three months to work fully. mm hmm so. They you know it's a group of people who are kind of going through what i'm going through and they had. A different set of information, but by that time I had already set the trigger the anxiety triggers and it kept getting worse and worse and worse, and then I finally told my husband, I need to go to hospital i'm not feeling like myself right now."
416.0,Provider,"yeah so tell me a little bit about so, is it just you and your husband in the House."
14943.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
416.0,Provider,"Okay, tell me a little bit about you, too, and how are you getting along and."
14943.0,Patient,"he's wonderful he's been very supportive he's a retired engineer for into it and you know money's not an issue Thank God we own our House we're financially stable I don't have to work, other than for the insurance. I need what's called commercial insurance and so that's why to pay for this drug so he's. I know he's. Very invested in my care and feeling better and he told me, it was the right thing for me to do to go to the hospital."
416.0,Provider,yeah.
14943.0,Patient,"At first, he said no, no you'll get through this you've gone through this before and i'm like I just don't have any reason to still be her."
416.0,Provider,I bet he's pretty worried huh.
14943.0,Patient,"yeah yeah yeah he he he kind of stopped playing golf after that and that's his favorite thing to do, I wish she'd go back and play golf but I can't force them to do anything. So yeah."
416.0,Provider,yeah well as you get better he'll probably feel more comfortable do. yeah stuff again.
14943.0,Patient,"Right and he has support he has a few friends and he's working on a garage project, you know redoing the garage so he's keeping busy."
416.0,Provider,How How long have you guys been married.

416.0,Provider,"Okay, so he's your daughter's Father as well."
14943.0,Patient,"Yes, yes yeah I had I have what I call a starter marriage, but that didn't didn't last long or wasn't good wasn't good for me, really."
416.0,Provider,yeah. It happens.
14943.0,Patient,lesson learned.
416.0,Provider,yeah that's right.
14943.0,Patient,don't take bad boys on the motorcycles.
416.0,Provider,Oh that's funny i'm about to marry one.
14943.0,Patient,he's not that bad of a bad boy he's not.
416.0,Provider,Far from it. we're way past that.
14943.0,Patient,"yeah that's it, it was growing it was. It was a growing relationship, and it was a way for me to get the heck you know I didn't even graduate from high school my my family life was so bad I just left. and had to get away from it, so I at 16 I just declared myself an adult and went to Community college and I found solace in education. I found, even though I had no idea how to study it took me two years and Community college to figure out how to do, six months worth of class work, but I kept going and I kept going and I finally graduated. At cal poly San Luis obispo when I was like 26 and then I went on, and got my masters and then I had a very nice Professor who helped me get my PhD. So I had a lot of."
416.0,Provider,"Work yeah you did very cool. yeah so um in terms of therapy goals have you wait, I should have asked you have you been in therapy before. Like okay. tell me what was that, like."
14943.0,Patient,"um it was good, it was an older gentleman, and he really helped me separate myself from my family. used to make a joke that I still think about today or a comment, he goes just pretend you're at a dance, and he goes, you can look be on the outside, on the edges, looking at the dance and watching people dance, but you don't need to participate in that dance. I he he said look you got you were dealt a bad hand of cards with the family. But you have a second chance to have a new and wonderful family don't Fuck it up. already very pragmatic very pragmatic good dude son was a professional baseball player nice guy it just got a little weird because he kept wanting to talk about sexual stuff and I wasn't comfortable talking about that okay."
416.0,Provider,So I wonder why.
14943.0,Patient,Something going on my husband and I were a good fit. And that eventually we were going to have to pay the piper let that are our relationship was to based on too much sexuality and. It just got uncomfortable for me.
416.0,Provider,I could say that.
14943.0,Patient,"He you know, he was wanting to talk about my past sexual endeavors and stuff and I was just getting a weird feeling like a voyeuristic feeling. He was. I don't know I just. We just separated ways and I haven't had anybody since then. So I saw him, I think, for two years."
416.0,Provider,Okay. And so it sounds like remember.
14943.0,Patient,He was really good for the family of origin excellent excellence. Like he helped me. really put that in perspective and be able to go and focus on my family without feeling guilty.
416.0,Provider,"yeah so there were things that he did, really, really well and then there were other things that you."
14943.0,Patient,"Know things that were I wasn't comfortable with. Okay, and I wasn't comfortable with the direction it was going and yeah. Just decided not to see him anymore."
416.0,Provider,It sounds like you also felt a lot more stable by that time.
14943.0,Patient,"Yes, yeah kaylee was doing well, we had her in a in a therapy program and a treatment program and I was no longer I we had gotten her a proper diagnosis. It was hell trying to get her a diagnosis, when she was a kid I had a neurologist say she needed to be institutionalized because she had broken my nose with one of these, you know where they think yeah. yeah and kids do that regular kids do that."
416.0,Provider,"They do. But, especially neuro divergent kids."
14943.0,Patient,"rolla just was also upset because. She was crying she was insolent while she didn't like strangers shouldn't like strange places so. It luckily Luckily, we got Dr steamer, who was the head of the program say look I think she has potential, we had a speech pathologist evaluate her and that speech pathologist says she has a lot of potential, I think this program would be good for her so Thank God for speech pathologists."
416.0,Provider,Thank God for speech pathologists. I agree. Patients who are a speech pathologist so.
14943.0,Patient,"yeah I am forever ever indebted. To the speech pathology department of children's they. They got her into the program and the rest is history. But, as you can kind of see from me, I kind of bulldoze through stuff until I get what I need, and so the problem is. I think I use the sleep issue as some kind of distraction where okay I I can't sleep all right i'm gonna roll everything into that and it's like it's a distraction from all this other stuff that i'm trying to deal with."
416.0,Provider,I think that's why I think that also you grew up having to assert a lot of control and take care of yourself and. and your life I kind of on your own. yeah so. um. Sorry.
14943.0,Patient,"Go ahead, no I used to call myself a free range kid. i'm oh yeah didn't have a bb gun and a bike and I got 50 cents and it's like don't come back to the street light comes on."
416.0,Provider,"yep. I mean some of that is the time I was raised, like that to to some extent that's. That was the those days."
14943.0,Patient,i'm sorry I interrupted you so. that's the control issue.
416.0,Provider,"Well, when you're used to having a certain semblance of control over your life, and this, I see this a lot in well educated women who are. Educated strong willed have overcome a lot of adversity in their lives. Oh, the feeling of being. powerless are helpless is pretty much intolerable it's it's it's not something that you're going to be comfortable with, and of course it's going to produce anxiety for you right anxiety is an evolutionary response to something that's dangerous for us."
14943.0,Patient,"Like not trusting the doctors and like even when I when i'm on a plane I don't trust the airline pilot I don't try, you know there's there's also a trust issue there as well."
416.0,Provider,"yeah absolutely so there's a lot to be said for that, I mean you, you have a lot of really good reasons why that will give you anxiety, you know. It makes perfect sense to me. How you're feeling out of control or feeling feeling vulnerable would be a huge trigger for you, of course, of course, it would so okay that's all right. that's something we can work on for sure."
14943.0,Patient,"Okay. i'd like to let go i'd like to be able to. I keep thinking, maybe spirituality is the answer, but that has its own set of issues from my childhood so."
416.0,Provider,"You know, do you have a spiritual practice right now."
14943.0,Patient,"No, no, I mean my my mom was my mom was Jewish and the Community in sacramento back in the 19 in 1960 found out that she was Jewish because they saw her taking. my grandmother to a synagogue one of the neighbors, and so my dad had a liquor store at the time in sacramento so we were rum running cakes and no one would let their children play with my older sister so that's why we moved to Davis, it was more liberal town. gotcha so after that my mom never ever ever discussed being Jewish ever everything stopped she was afraid she lived in fear of being just."
416.0,Provider,"So sorry going to faith healers she even got a faith healer for me one time, when I had mono."
14943.0,Patient,"So there was a lot of fear around medical things as well, when I was sick, she would want to bring in these faith healers and Christian scientists and all this other stuff and it just got it's like she focused on it so much that made me think that I was going to die or something."
416.0,Provider,So there's a lot of this is wrapped up in your. yeah and your.
14943.0,Patient,"yeah I had, I had a Gore phobia when I had mono because she wouldn't let me outside and I developed the Gore phobia when I was about 12 and then I developed anorexia because my sister wouldn't stop talking about my weight."
416.0,Provider,yeah you I was actually gonna ask about that you fit kind of the the profile for eating disorders in a pretty heavy way.
14943.0,Patient,"I had, I saw I saw Dr. Philip zimbardo I was one of his first patients that is eating disorder clinic at Stanford and he was wonderful."
416.0,Provider,How is. How is all of that now.
14943.0,Patient,"Oh i've. I want to make a joke then i'm going to put a shirt on saying I conquered anorexia yeah I have actually now I still have eating issues, I still have. I always will, but I couldn't lose weight or gain weight like i've gained weight, because the seroquel i've gained like 10 pounds like in the. Like in a week it was crazy so i'm i'm supposed to be eating very clean because of this illness and I was. After my breakdown I kind of just went screw it I don't care so i'm slowly getting back into it i'm starting to eat my apples again in my my organic food and everything so it's something that I, I manage. I got I got over the agoraphobia a lot of it, too, by. starting to I got really fat during the during the agoraphobia because my mom would let me out of the House she's afraid of getting sick so she kept me out of school for a year. Okay, and brought in all these weird doctors and stuff to try to give me all these homeopathic things anyway long story short, it. I started wanting to get out and wanting to get healthy and wanting to cure myself, so I started riding my bike non stop and then I started going to the university gym and that's when I developed anorexia. I just quit eating because I. didn't want my sister to call me fat anymore."
416.0,Provider,"Right yeah. Okay, so um. Okay."
14943.0,Patient,And what about I know i'm alone i'm sorry.
416.0,Provider,"No you're not, no, no, no, no, actually it's it all aligns perfectly, which is why i've been asked you, the next. question, what is your relationship with alcohol."
14943.0,Patient,"um it was I mean I drink, but not to excess so i'm very aware that my dad was an alcoholic very aware, so I have had times in my life, where I have have had too much to drink. Do I consider myself an alcoholic I have, I have great potential, but so far I haven't I haven't gone over the edge."
416.0,Provider,Okay kind of glad to hear that. So.
14943.0,Patient,"Some aware of that. I don't want to get into patterns, like my father."
416.0,Provider,Okay yeah good.
14943.0,Patient,"let's avoid that when when I was running the coven I had to start the coven lab at children's. I can't even go there, it was so stressful I started drinking a lot when I got home. So I stopped doing that my husband says hey what's going on, you have another drink, so he. He puts me back on the proper path."
416.0,Provider,Okay.
14943.0,Patient,But it's there i'm gonna be honest with you it's there it's I I know i'm I know I have great potential.
416.0,Provider,"yeah yeah yeah So when I when I said that it all fits together. It does right so based on your history and kind of your and everything that you've told me so far there is definitely like. All of the stuff that you've talked about the eating disorder or the anxiety, the childhood with."
14943.0,Patient,"lacked obsession with exercise. Which i've always had a couple hours a day in the gym. And I don't have that anymore that helped me cope so much. yeah. And I when I couldn't go anymore, because of. The Perry Perry card itis it was like a part of me was ripped away so I didn't have that I didn't have work to be. Confident. And I didn't have exercise anymore."
416.0,Provider,yeah.
14943.0,Patient,And i'm. Just I don't I hope I get better. What I call a chronic illness.
416.0,Provider,"You do you do. And it's a it's a brave new world that you're having to face. You know and it's it's scary, especially given your history. yeah yeah to feel like that so um Okay, so I definitely am hearing some pretty big themes is there anything else that you want to make sure I know before. I stop asking questions."
14943.0,Patient,"No i'm just trying to right now i'm just trying to look at. Other coping strategies. and Okay feeling alone is one of the hardest things right now I don't have my gym friends, do I have genuine friendships yeah I have a few, but most of my friendships are work based or gym based and I don't have it it's like my life has just been the rug has been pulled."
416.0,Provider,"yeah I could see how that would feel that way for sure. So um yeah. So I hear definitely that that coping skills, increasing your coping skills to manage all of this right, and then i'm also hearing a lot about control versus flexibility right because you grew up in a home where you had to assert a lot of control and or be in control to be safe right."
14943.0,Patient,yeah I mean like my sister would set me up she would just. Say hey christy let's play circus and then she she say stand against the wall and then she throw knives at me. And i'd be like this is supposed to be fun. Eric or she would. she'd love my anytime I got an animal she would of course like a hamster or something she would set it free let it go thought that was hilarious.
416.0,Provider,yeah see a you dealt with a lot of like emotional torture.
14943.0,Patient,And there's a lack of trust. Because yeah that that's my foundational relationship that I had growing up.
416.0,Provider,mm hmm.
14943.0,Patient,"So that's where I think I felt my lack of trust and I, you know I want to trust the medical professionals, I do i'm just also going to have my stick my nose in there and try to. Say hey if you looked at this look at that."
416.0,Provider,mm hmm so.
14943.0,Patient,yeah yep.
416.0,Provider,"Okay, so um alright so definitely i'm hearing to increase coping to start to work on. Some flexibility some control and then definitely there's I hear a lot of grief. A lot."
14943.0,Patient,i'm grieving my my previous life.
416.0,Provider,"i'm on your also grieving you're missing your daughter your grieving for a childhood that you didn't have I mean I care, a lot of grief and you. check sense."
14943.0,Patient,i've just i've just had a life of spinning plates. Hoping that someday I could stop spinning them and be happy. Like.
416.0,Provider,"Has there been a time in your life, where you felt like really truly happy."
14943.0,Patient,"i'm probably when I was in in in college, I was happy."
416.0,Provider,And what was it about that time that. i'm really happy for you.
14943.0,Patient,"I felt competent. I felt like I was doing something for me. No one can take it away from me, no one can make fun of me. I could be I could be proud of what I did. And it gave me something to be proud of something to feel like I accomplished something in my life."
416.0,Provider,Okay.
14943.0,Patient,"yeah, of course, my daughter, it was. it's difficult with a child that has special needs and you don't go to the park and you hear the other mobs talking about stupid things silly things."
416.0,Provider,yeah.
14943.0,Patient,"it's not silly to them, but to you it's like my God, you have any idea what i'm dealing with right now. it's like i've had. You know i'm angry because i've had so many blows in my life, and we were just getting ready to start traveling again I understand koeppen but. Am I, like the one person got almost died from the vaccine what the hell. You know it's like I understand people get cancer and i'm grateful it's not cancer. But. i'm just having trouble adjusting."
416.0,Provider,yeah no I hear that and I hear that really loud and clear.
14943.0,Patient,"The group meetings. Sometimes, I just want to shake those kids. and go cheerily so lucky you're you're healthy. And I realized that they have their other issues and it's none of my business, but really when you lose your health everything else, takes a real backseat. Yes. And the only antidote to this is time. The only thing that heals this is time and, of course, they tell me don't get your stress level to hide it's like oh my God. Okay."
416.0,Provider,"yeah lots of grief, I hear a lot of that a."
14943.0,Patient,"lot of struggle, I mean no one's ever said that to me."
416.0,Provider,Really. Does that ring true for you.
14943.0,Patient,I don't I don't know if I knew what grief is. I don't know if i've ever really grieved for anything i've been too busy trying to fix it.
416.0,Provider,mm hmm. it's exactly right.
14943.0,Patient,Like when my cat died my 16 year old cat died June and I had to put them down hold them in my arms. And first thing I wanted to do was go ahead and get another cat that day.
416.0,Provider,"that's right. do for you in the Group, where we talk about trauma responses."
14943.0,Patient,um yeah.
416.0,Provider,And we were talking about fight flight fun or freeze.
14943.0,Patient,yeah.
416.0,Provider,"i'm flight, you are big time flight yeah big time big time, so your trauma response doesn't allow you your trauma responses to not grieve. To not feel and here you are, this is why i'm hearing so much grief here you are in a place for possibly the first time in your life, where you don't have much to do, but feel and there is nowhere to go to to fly it to flee away from this right."
14943.0,Patient,"there's nowhere to go i'm stuck with me. Yes, feeling sorry for myself."
416.0,Provider,"Well, the good news is that it's actually an okay place to be it's going to feel like shit it feels terrible. And that's what you're experiencing, but the good news is that it's actually really healthy to feel, and if we can help you feel it in a way that's tolerable for you and to get used to it and to not be so scared of that grief and we'll get through it."
14943.0,Patient,"yeah I didn't even agreed for my mom I agree like one day I cried and then I got on the business of. Getting selling the House getting rid of stuff you know. yeah it was a business like yeah and my first husband left me and left me with bills like paid until I got married again so it was, like all right get on with it."
416.0,Provider,Right.
14943.0,Patient,whenever something hasn't worked i've run away from it.
416.0,Provider,"uh huh. Like except for that when you do that, it doesn't go away. it's been there, the whole time. So it's just built up and here you are not able to run away anymore. Your body's like I know you're here. So here we are. It makes sense that you're feeling so crappy."
14943.0,Patient,"yeah I don't know how to do I don't know how to deal with it. yeah I mean, I know that there's steps in the grief process that I don't even know where I am in that, because some so detached from it."
416.0,Provider,I don't know that you are you're you're you sound like you're in the middle of it to me you're deep in grief. I mean this these tears the stress this stuff that's grief.
14943.0,Patient,"You know I mean every everything that I had spent my life, trying to make perfect. Good it's you know they basically said well you know your job that's over with in February, unless you can come to work part time which i'm fine with part time but I will be doing what I used to do i'm. i'm basically nothing now you know because i'm i'm all year, the sick, one. People tiptoe around me."
416.0,Provider,yeah. Lots of grief lots of change that feels awful.
14943.0,Patient,"And I keep being reminded of it every day oh take the code vaccine yeah Okay, even though I was the first one to take it in December, I took it in late December last year it. It almost killed me and get I have to remain silent and be i'm still pro backs my daughter got the vaccine I but it's same time it reminds me of it every day when people talk about co but i'm like oh."
416.0,Provider,So yeah you were the. The rare person here about this terrible reaction. yeah. Okay.
14943.0,Patient,sounds I just want to know. I asked the doctor some if i'm going to get through this and they say yeah you're going to get through this so. i'm trusting him.
416.0,Provider,"i'd say from my perspective, not from a medical perspective, but from an emotional perspective, I think you have lots of potential to get through it on this end on the emotional side, if you want to do the work. Oh yeah."
14943.0,Patient,yeah.
416.0,Provider,"I think you could feel a lot happier. If you want to do the work, and if you, I think we can do this."
14943.0,Patient,yeah.
416.0,Provider,"Well, very optimistic for you."
14943.0,Patient,"Well, I tend to be very clinical person and look because that's what i've done my whole life, you know doing research and looking at looking at it any any potential bias or any anything that. Could could bias, the experiment or and now i'm. I I like to approach things clinically and have exercises and."
416.0,Provider,"And that's going to get them. Okay, absolutely that's exactly what you're going to get from me."
14943.0,Patient,"As I just couldn't when I went to the hospital I couldn't function anymore, I was up all night pacing the halls they they were like."
416.0,Provider,You were just rolling really at your limit.
14943.0,Patient,i'm just such a failure.
416.0,Provider,"you're not a failure. that's not a helpful to have. Not and it's also not true you're far from a failure you're survivors, which you are."
14943.0,Patient,I just don't know how much I can survive.
416.0,Provider,"Well it's understandable that you feel very much like you're at your limit, because you are like this is a lot you've been through a lot it's too much for anybody to feel like they can handle and. you're going to be okay. you're going to get through it i'm speaking from the emotional end. of things, obviously i'm."
14943.0,Patient,"Eating it. yeah I mean i've even known people who've had the surgery they do it at two places in the United States Cleveland clinic and university Michigan and there's one doctor that does it and it's like, if I have to do that i'll do it. Good speed another experience."
416.0,Provider,You have survived a lot in your life. This isn't going to get you.
14943.0,Patient,Okay.
416.0,Provider,yeah.
14943.0,Patient,"I feel guilty about my husband he's super healthy he's 70 he's super fit super healthy, we were planning on doing a bunch of stuff and we're like okay well after coven now it's like. i'm hoping, you can still happen yeah."
416.0,Provider,"Well let's hold on to that hope. But you know it could have just as easily been him right, I mean this is what we sign up for when we get into a lifetime partnership we sign up for the, for better or for. Worse, and if the tables were turned."
14943.0,Patient,What would take care of him he's already been through two knee replacements and a hip replacement right.
416.0,Provider,"So I think he's batting an eye over this. Okay, and I think you guys will still have plenty of time and. opportunities to do great things but we've got to get you into a place where you start to feel a little better. Right, because the this is. Right, this is the rub is like you, you have a heart issue, and then the heart, he gives you anxiety which exacerbates the heart issue, so we got to work on some coping skills here."
14943.0,Patient,They said that this recurrent pericarditis. gives you ptsd because you keep you keep feeling like it's lurking there waiting to come back.
416.0,Provider,"yep absolutely absolutely. Okay, so um okay. Well, I would like to see you so you're scheduled for group every week right. Yes, okay i'm going to see you in group every week and then I would like to see you at least twice a month and then, if we need to increase it or decrease it, we can do that, but that we all see you six times a month."
14943.0,Patient,"Okay, great."
416.0,Provider,And so. let's see do you have your calendar out with you.
14943.0,Patient,"yeah on pretty much Tuesdays and Thursdays, of the best for me, but. i'm pretty much open anytime this time of day is perfect for me."
416.0,Provider,"Is there anything. Earlier, that you have available yeah. i'm going to be switching my hours so i'm not going to have. evenings Okay, except for on Thursdays actually I will have Thursday evenings but. We can, if there's earlier that might be better."
14943.0,Patient,I mean basically. I I i'm off work at two in the afternoon on Monday Wednesday and Friday the Tuesday Thursday i'm available all day.
416.0,Provider,Oh perfect okay. hey ready.
14943.0,Patient,"know we have group on Thursday, so that, so we can't do."
416.0,Provider,yeah and it takes.
14943.0,Patient,An hour to get home so anytime like three I know you said you're not having evenings.
416.0,Provider,"I can do absolutely. Tuesday okay let's look at so for now let's look at the 26th of October, so we can get at least one more session. Okay that's two weeks from now. All right, um. So let's see."
14943.0,Patient,My aim for. Free.
416.0,Provider,That day. Perfect okay so let's do that and then maybe we can see if we can speak without time and. And then so two weeks from that would be November nights a week could do 1215 that day too.
14943.0,Patient,yeah that's fine.
416.0,Provider,And then two weeks from now we'll just get you scheduled. Is the 23rd and we could do the same time.
14943.0,Patient,23rd is Tuesday okay.
416.0,Provider,"All right, so then we'll just try to stick with that."
14943.0,Patient,"Okay, good good and i'm turning off at a seroquel. Just as far as I know, you're not in the MED MED thing but that'll be i'll be training that damn it gives me a sense of control. You know, being able to train back down on the sleeping meds."
416.0,Provider,"So, and can I give you your first assignment and. My first assignment for you is mindfulness it's the simplest easiest and yet quite difficult in so many other ways, but it is the sort of quickest way to cope with anxiety is to develop a mindfulness practice. mm hmm, so there is there are about a million. websites devoted to mindfulness there are Apps that are free, or some that aren't. But mindfulness is basically being present in the moment and breathing. What anxiety is. is stressing about a future something that hasn't happened yet. or it's ruminating over a past right. What it isn't is being present in the moment. And so, this is where mindfulness comes in, because mindfulness brings us into the moment. So I want you to do a little bit of research, since you're a research person on mindfulness. Okay, and come up with a daily mindfulness practice for yourself."
14943.0,Patient,"i've been doing gratitude, which does help."
416.0,Provider,"gratitude great also come up with a daily you can combine the two actually come up with a daily mindfulness practice. Okay, that it needs to involve being present and breathing other than that I don't."
14943.0,Patient,Know whatever works.
416.0,Provider,"there's so many versions of mindfulness out there, you know, some people do mindfulness while they're doing the dishes right where they're just not thinking about anything except for the dishes they're feeling. The water."
14943.0,Patient,that's like going to the gym yeah. You feel nothing but just your heart pumping in the.
416.0,Provider,"Exercise there. that's right yeah so um this and I know, since you can't do that right now."
14943.0,Patient,I can walk around the block.
416.0,Provider,"You can do it, while you're walking actually mindfulness is fantastic while you're walking it but anyway, you can look up walking mindfulness. All right, get get a bunch of ideas so. that's my short term goal for you. And and that's going to be the first step in working on some coping for you. And and. And then the other, the other, second part, part two of your assignment is is a grief piece, and I want you to work on not being afraid of grief. Of crying a feeling I promise you I 100% promise you that nobody has ever died from being sad and grieving. from expressing their sadness and being with their feelings."
14943.0,Patient,"I just always thought it was a useless emotion. it's like what's the point Moving on, you know."
416.0,Provider,"that's sadly it's not I mean wouldn't it be nice if it were and i'll tell you i'm so similar to you, like my i'm a i'm a flight girl to i'm like hey i'm out of here I don't want to feel, but the problem is that it builds up it literally lives in your body that trauma lives in your body. And so, when we push that stuff down it's going to come up."
14943.0,Patient,"Now it's like a calculator that's never been reset. yeah and what and i've never i've tried to talk to my sister about how she heard me. And she just said, oh that's she goes I did that, because mom and dad were so mean to me. And so i'm like Okay, what do I do with that you know slow."
416.0,Provider,Nothing nothing right now right now it's about you. So just try to be with any feelings that come up and express them feel them. Let them out. And we're not going to mask them with anything just let them out just be with him and then working on setting up a mindfulness practice those two are connected.
14943.0,Patient,"Okay sounds good, give me something to do."
416.0,Provider,"All right, kristin."
14943.0,Patient,All right.
