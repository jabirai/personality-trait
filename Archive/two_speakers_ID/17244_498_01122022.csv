498.0,Provider,right there you're welcome and.
17244.0,Patient,I think sometimes i'm harder on myself. You know what I mean.
498.0,Provider,"Absolutely, it is not something that you decide to wake up, one day, and you just say I think i'm done with that i'll leave it in yesterday. Something I can do that, but for most people, and I do stress this most people, it does not work that way so kudos to you for working in way down to two to four pack two to four cigarettes a day that's huge in anyone's book. Should you decide that you would like some information on it, you can always call one 800 quit Qu it now in order view for additional information and then, of course. The therapist that you see here can also assist you with continuation of smoking cessation and just because every every every cigarette that you eliminate helps so that's i'm stressing the monumental reduction that's you. you're welcome with regard to the insomnia, that you're facing. i'd be more than happy to provide you with some trials and it's an antidepressant that we many, many prescribers have utilized for temporary asleep. The tablets come and 50 milligram dosages but you could take half of that which is a very, very low and initial dose. In order to promote sleep temporarily while you're in this phase and then, of course, is your sleep improves independently of the medication, you can you know stop it. You know, as you see fit, but it's safe to use in combination with your zoloft while you're experiencing some difficulty with regard to falling asleep and remaining a sleep sleep sleep quality a duration."
17244.0,Patient,"Okay, I have tried transit on in the past and it gives me a terrible headache."
498.0,Provider,"Okay, I was just about to go into like the headache."
17244.0,Patient,"Good yeah I cannot take that and I was going to ask. You taking the zoloft Can I take like costco has the sleeping aids over the counter and I take i've taken I haven't taken any with the zoloft because I was afraid of mixing you know. Because i'm not a big pill taker I don't like to take pills, but i'm trying it. So can I take like a half of one before I go to bed to help me sleep or no."
498.0,Provider,Is it melatonin.
17244.0,Patient,"it's not melatonin let me, can I get the bottle real quick. Can you see me because I can't see myself but."
498.0,Provider,"No, but I can hear you, and if you could spell the name of on the bottle that. i'll take that. take up too much of your time with. technical difficulties."
17244.0,Patient,"Okay it's kirkland sleep aid and it's doxey do X, Y la Am I n E. Another word Su CC I in a T. And it's 25 milligrams so I take a half one. So it's like 14 when oil. Well, and a half milligrams that I take with you know that I could take before I go to bed."
498.0,Provider,"Oh docs a lemon. it's. Basically, an Anti histamine. So it is that you could take a long it's kind of like benadryl, which is actually what I was going to recommend after you said that you had a successful trial with tries it on. The Anna histamine that we write prescriptions for is hard drugs disease. And it's it's like it's also like a benadryl So if you want to go with the duck Fleming salt fascinate than that that's fine as well, tell me the milligrams that you."
17244.0,Patient,Have so it's a whole pill is 25 milligrams so i'll be taking one half. Because I when I take a half I kind of wake up groggy in the morning and I so that's like plenty for me i'm pretty. What do you call a lightweight when it comes to medication effects me problem for the most. Now I take. zyrtec in the morning for allergies.
498.0,Provider,mm hmm.
17244.0,Patient,Should I not take that since i'm taking the sleep aid at night.
498.0,Provider,And I you're taking our tech for. Allergies for prevention. And what's the dosage on those are check.
17244.0,Patient,Let me find out hold on. 10 milligrams I just don't want to feel groggy in the morning too much you know what I mean. Working stuff.
498.0,Provider,"On the combination, the usage of the tsar tech could. It could cause like an increase some. sedated effect and CNS depressant effect with regard to the sleep way that you have. Which you're taking half of it, so my best recommendation would be to. be mindful of taking those are taking the morning when you will take this or take in the morning and then take a half like you're planning to do have this link bait at night and then monitor your. Your monitor your the way that you feel the next day if you feel like you're slum or you know prolong for tea or. You know if you're feeling overly sedated they're both very, very low dosages a whole Internet the whole tablet have to sleep baby is 25 and some people even take to for 50 so you should be okay, but I would just say go slow with regards. To trying it first."
17244.0,Patient,"yeah I don't have to take the Zola I mean the zyrtec everyday. Look at this, but the weather that we've had it, you know I just my doctor because I got sick with the sinus infection, so I just continued it, but I don't have to take it every day so."
498.0,Provider,"yeah give yourself a break in between anytime you're combining medications with implausibility to call CNS depression, I tell people to go slow and monitor it, because you're starting at such a low dosage I wouldn't expect any huge effects, but just for your own functionality. To just you know Steve take it slow go low and slow and see how it affects you for the next day because that's going to be more the determining factor anything is how you feel the next day. Right, because you don't have to have this art techniques that you could always skip the next morning dose."
17244.0,Patient,"Right now, how long does it take for the zoloft to fully work, I mean I read two weeks, but then i'm thinking now I don't think so."
498.0,Provider,"No, no, not. If you've never had an asset an antidepressant before then, it takes two weeks in order for you to receive some initial benefit. For for full therapeutic benefit you're looking at anywhere from six to 12 weeks that golden spaces right around eight but you'll initially see some proceeds benefit at around two weeks, then four weeks, then six weeks eight weeks when it kind of comes all together right."
17244.0,Patient,"Well, I noticed like with the depression it's definitely helping with that, so I have noticed a change with that my moods aren't. You know, except for the you know, a couple of days, the last four days, just because asleep issues, but I know that when I sleep, I feel so every of course everybody feels so much better, you know what I. mean, so I don't feel that, but I have noticed even my husband noticed that my my moods are more stable and i'm not crying i'm not. yeah you know, so I do feel better that way it's just the whole sleeping thing that i'm trying to get under control, and I know I have to be patient which i'm not when it comes to medication."
498.0,Provider,"understood understood. I would say, give yourself a week on the sleep aid. See how you feel i'm willing to bet that you're going to feel a lot better and then. If you're concerned about the reliance on the sleep eight it has a very low propensity for addiction potential, but if you become concerned about it, you can go to every other day, you see. In order to give yourself, you know some time to modulate your own you know sleep rhythm cycle."
17244.0,Patient,Okay yeah I don't have to work tomorrow so i'll take it tonight and that way i'll get better night's sleep so. Okay right.
498.0,Provider,Okay um any any i'm seeing or hearing anything that isn't there. No any thoughts about harming yourself. know any panic attacks.
17244.0,Patient,"um I know i've had like I said that I had a couple little anxiety moments, you know, but with meditation I. have learned how to control that a little bit you know and exercise so."
498.0,Provider,But.

498.0,Provider,"I will sleep, is something that we can handle. yeah and have you been admitted to a group yet Lisa."

498.0,Provider,"you're very welcome, have a good day see you Monday."
17244.0,Patient,"You too, all right bye bye."

With regard to major depressive disorder in anxiety today reporting difficulty with regard to sleep on her new regimen of zoloft 50 milligrams per day reporting good management of mood and anxiety, but most recent. few days difficulty with insomnia, so i'm patient is denying transitional due to a previous. intolerable trial of the tribes don't opting for over the counter kirkland's dogs dogs lemmy designate patient has 25 milligram tablets and is opting for half of the tablets in foregoing the hydrox xen. prescription and so patient will utilize it over the next four weeks in order to improve overall sleep and report to me and group with Lisa peers to Kenya on Monday January the 12th and i'll follow up with her i'm in January 17 i'll follow up with her at that time recording stuff."
