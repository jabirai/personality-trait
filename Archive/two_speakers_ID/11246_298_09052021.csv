298.0,Provider,Did you pick up the murtaza pain and try it.
11246.0,Patient,"No, I didn't yeah I was hoping, I could get like an anxiety pill, so when I feel anxious I could take it, and then something for sleep at night."
298.0,Provider,"Okay, so I sent you murtaza pain for sleep at night, I said that two days ago. Okay, and so I want you to try that and have you tried the visceral twice a day."

298.0,Provider,"I still want to keep it on because it doesn't have a lot of side effects to it. Okay, and. i'm will turn in a prescription for the clonazepam and. I want to spread that out over like i'll give you seven tablets, but that means that I want you to take it like as far spread it out as far as you can. A minimum two weeks. Okay. Oh no that's like every other day, and hopefully you don't need it at all."
11246.0,Patient,"So I have the nightmare and anxiety mad, and then I have a panic attack, though."
298.0,Provider,"Yes, and no I so i'm going to look at doing. A monologue for calming your heart rate town and it lowers your blood pressure and calms your heart rate, you can try it if it doesn't work, it might be that it's too low, of a dose or it might be but it's not. For you."

Working on that. So."
298.0,Provider,"Now, on the nighttime medication start with a half a tablet and take it on the weekends, because I don't want you to wake up to groggy. Okay, and so definitely try it when you don't have to wake up in the morning and if a half a tablet doesn't count cover it for the murtaza pain, then you can take a whole one. Okay, and I sent over Oh, I still have to send over I sent over the NASA Pam but now i'm sending over the propranolol. And it's propranolol is not like a big gun medicine. But it does."
11246.0,Patient,Work okay.

11246.0,Patient,"know about this weekend I feel like it's just been a lot of new information so i'm just trying to like self sooth and like. To stay in bed, to be honest with you."
298.0,Provider,"Okay. Now propranolol can lower your blood pressure, so not not enough to make that much of a difference, but if you jump up and you feel light headed just know that it's the propranolol calming your body down. So don't jump up. Okay, and. And you're doing good to just keep appointments with me as we find out what works. I like. I like the trend that we're doing here we're getting into less and less heavy medicine. yeah this there's the trend here of good things happening with you. yeah even though. You have more anxiety right now it's kind of understandable because of your new job."
