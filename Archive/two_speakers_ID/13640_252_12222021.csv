252.0,Provider,hey oh. Okay.
13640.0,Patient,"No, you know I go through this. A lot where I won't sleep really good, for I mean because I always have trouble sleeping i'm not always gotta knock myself out, but I have. Even when I take my marijuana that night take it usually about 738 and kicks in a couple three four hours later than I usually am able to fall asleep through that. But then there's. Already, a couple weeks, where I won't be able to fall asleep, no matter what what I mean it takes a lot for me to fall asleep. and And i'm like this and I just I don't know what it is. I should be used to it but. I don't like it when it happens."
252.0,Provider,yeah it's a cycle.
13640.0,Patient,Is it.
252.0,Provider,"If it's repetitive. You know you go into the cycles it's it's. it's a cycle you got to learn, if you got we got to figure out ways to break that cycle. yeah so that it stopped. Right. that's how we learn everything our body does too and learn cycles. You know. You have a hard time sleeping. Do you try to take NAPs during the day."
13640.0,Patient,"I can't take NAPs during the day if i'm asleep don't wake me up because i'm either really, really needed yet or i'm sick. I cannot sleep during the day I wish I could but it's always been that way and i've always had trouble sleeping I remember, even as a little tiny kid. Like sneak out in the living room and watch TV because i'm wide awake at two three o'clock in the morning and back then they didn't have TV shows. Where the hazy after."
252.0,Provider,yeah.
13640.0,Patient,"I would be up, I remember getting into more coverage of the flashlight and reading books, because I couldn't sleep, I was wide awake. always been this way."
252.0,Provider,"And, have you been diagnosed with ADHD."
13640.0,Patient,"No, no. Thanks so."
252.0,Provider,"I was just wondering, because sometimes you know that's surely an indicator."
13640.0,Patient,yeah my son my son my daughter both have sleep issues my son's very ADHD so.
252.0,Provider,Right to be well. came from someone is.
13640.0,Patient,"dad I blame everything on his dad. out every time. No, I mean i've never. I don't know i've never really had trouble in school, I was really like a A and B student all the way through and."
252.0,Provider,it's just sleep.
13640.0,Patient,"The sleep, is the issue."
252.0,Provider,Always. what's your process when you go to bed.
13640.0,Patient,"anymore. i've been trying to pay more attention to it, since the LIFE coach told me to. But normally i'll go to bed around eight or nine o'clock. And i'll watch TV for a while play on my phone read a book whatever until the weed kicks in but i'll tell you even back in the day. When I was like in high school my music at night, I have to have noise, to be able to go to sleep, and I would I would do the same thing i'd have music on at night and. Finally, fall asleep in the wee hours."
252.0,Provider,um.
13640.0,Patient,"I know what i'm doing now isn't helping the situation, but I don't know what else to do, I mean I can't just lay there for six hours. You know I mean because I will literally laid out right at eight or nine o'clock every night the dogs make me because it's bedtime and then i'm awake if I i'm easily awake for four hours. With the week. If I don't take the weed I can be awakening. To 35 o'clock seven o'clock in the morning I won't go to sleep and that's laying there going to fall asleep right a rollover puts up mom where my brain won't listen to it too much, but there's noise i've tried all kinds of crap. And it's just and i'm going through that cycle, right now, where no matter what I do i'm not falling asleep peacefully enough and plus i'm i'm waking up just like I haven't even slept. it's been that way for as long as I can remember."
252.0,Provider,"i'm trying to think, because there are other things that you can do. To try to help with that. cycle like. There are, have you tried not watching TV before you go to bed, not of being on your phone before you go to bed reading a book is good. um. and trying to make it the book that you read. Making it a good book a happy book, something that puts good thoughts into your brain before you go to bed."
13640.0,Patient,i'm all for free.
252.0,Provider,or something.
13640.0,Patient,"i've always did Stephen King he's my idol I remember one time at the House on in the Bay area. Some people were visiting one of my roommates and all of a sudden, they heard a screen. And then they freaked out those middle of the night and it freaked out what the what the hell is that what's that oh words just she's got on TV on the horse movie and they said she sweeping through that and yeah i've only been woke. Maybe two or three times in my entire life and maybe a couple times with bad nightmares other than that I sleep I sleep through all of it. But I have knocked myself out just even get to the point where I sleep."
252.0,Provider,"Well, he gets to a point to. Where like melatonin good example melatonin works for a while. And then it's like it quits working."
13640.0,Patient,yeah nightmares yeah.
252.0,Provider,A marijuana can have the same effect. It can work for a while and they don't quit working. um what happens if you try. Not. taking any marijuana.
13640.0,Patient,Oh i've done it before yeah.
252.0,Provider,And i'm setting the mood basically i'm really do you take a shower before you go to bed.
13640.0,Patient,i've been trying to do that. It helps somewhat it relaxes me puts me in the mood. But i'm still awake.
252.0,Provider,"So. it's your brain, so you know, taking a shower. Putting something on that is sleep producing. Right. Whether it be, not a horror flick but trying something different, like there is all kinds of meditation shit you can get off YouTube that can help with promoting sleep. And there is there's even this certain. Oh, my God it's like a radio frequency but it's music. it's the weirdest thing ever because I tried it, but he and I just had it like there was a roomful I had like four or five people at my house and I put it on in the background. I was mellow. Everyone in the room stayed mellow. And it what it does, is it really just kind of float. That feeling that Meta that mellow feeling that sleepiness and it's about really paying attention to what's in your mind when you go to bed. Right you've got your happy place. You need to be in your happy place when you go to bed. That place where you feel safe. We feel loved. Where there's nothing that can get you in there, because if you're happy space, nothing can get you in there. Right."
13640.0,Patient,"i'd have to lock the door. lock the fucking door. yeah. I sleep with my head. Normally I sleep with my head away from the door i'll be in a room and i'll be up against the wall. i've never been in a situation where I was attacked in public or in my bedroom but yet it's only been recently i've been laying across my dad. And my head is up again, is facing the door and not really bizarre for me to fall asleep that way. very weird for me to lay with my head anywhere near the door."
252.0,Provider,Okay.
13640.0,Patient,"don't even know yeah I don't know why I feel that way never been in a position to. Now, with. Really weird do not like it."
252.0,Provider,But you've been doing it.
13640.0,Patient,i've been doing it yeah.
252.0,Provider,Something says that there's something that's been going processing through you. If you've been able to sleep with your head by the door. something you released.
13640.0,Patient,"could be. For maybe. Just this last year, maybe. Where I can actually way that way."
252.0,Provider,Maybe you're subconsciously coming off the ledge a little bit. And you don't even realize it.
13640.0,Patient,could be yeah I mean I think it's weird. I never do it anytime I you know when you move and you're setting up your room I gotta have my bed as far away from the door as possible and where I can see something coming. totally ridiculous for me. I don't but I gonna have to think about that. Think about that a little bit.
252.0,Provider,"You think about you know being safe and think about a lot of the things that we've been talking about processing through and taking a look at you know what I mean and little movements like that show that you have a piece inside of you that says we are safe. We are say. And it comes out, you might not even know what's happening, but it comes out in little behaviors like what you're describing to me. And so you have to just continually remind yourself that you are safe you're in a great spot. No one can get can hurt you where you're at. You know, loving that little girl. You know. And it happens in little increments. And then, before you know it it's like. you'll feel it here you'll feel it here you won't be sitting on the ledge you know but you've been on the lead for very, very long time, so it's about time that you started coming off of it."
13640.0,Patient,"very nice yeah. hey my daughter I hurt my daughter's feelings by talking to her, the other day and I told her how I feel about Christmas admit it makes me anxious."
252.0,Provider,mm hmm.
13640.0,Patient,"inside and she says, well, I never knew that growing up so she goes and tells one of her people at work that I told her this and the person who work said well you've been your life has been a whole life. And that's the way my daughter feels right now is that i've been lying to her all this time she's biting no you didn't like Christmas that's not what I was saying, I love Christmas. And I explained to her, you know how her father would make me feel every time you know that was going on, I never knew what was gonna happen, and then a. week later, she comes by the pickups email and as they get the packages here for safety and she says, you know you really bothered me saying that I didn't know you didn't like Christmas we don't ever have to do it, he said, your that's not what I said. I said I love Christmas, I loved every minute of it with you kids but. But your father made it very difficult for me to relax to the you know where I was enjoying everything, because I mean. I remember one year he made me go back to the store day before Christmas, with my own money, thank you very much and buy more gifts, because he didn't think there were enough gifts under the tree, I mean I was always know, I was always on point with him. And so we have that conversation and so she came back to me a few days later, and said, you know. i'm sorry to drop something off at her house and she says, you know I don't think it was all my dad's fault. So what do you mean i'm not trying to blame him for all my shit and just that's the way I felt she says well you know my grandma and grandpa were there too, and they were terrible and she proceeded to tell me how she hated have my mom and my stepdad there because it was always. There takers you know, and it was always something's got to be this way and it's not this way it's not good enough, I hated taking my mother out to lunch. She always bitch about the food it's like well then give it back food back and then I get it, she saw their negativity which was even worse than my own, and she says, maybe, maybe they were part of the problem and then she pointed out that maybe my current. Partner can be very, very grumpy at times. and We can, and he was almost unlivable for the first couple years moved here, so now he has his little hissy fits around the holidays, which you know I try to avoid you don't fight really you just. ignore the other one till the other one gets over. Well, he doesn't do is quite so well and it's like she was trying to tell me that other people have impacted my holiday your ability and worry. I said well i'm gonna have to think about that, because now, you know, and I don't I don't know if she's right or not I mean if she could be my I hated my mother, but you know don't we all but. And yes, he's been. he's almost a different person, but when he's grumpy and shit I just you know go to your room, you know just leave me alone I don't want to be around. You know, and how I treat them as like. A real i'll do this. Right and, and so I don't know if she's right or not, whether they helped turn me into. worry board or I ain't. i'll tell you. My step dad and her father would get drunk together, and then they pull knives on each other. i'm kind of ship."
252.0,Provider,mm hmm.
13640.0,Patient,"So yeah holidays with them and all everybody in the mix you never know what's gonna happen. yeah you just didn't know what was gonna happen. I mean so yeah maybe yeah they didn't help they certainly didn't help and. His attitude doesn't help either. But. it's a lot easier to live with him, then, with my mother and my stepfather and my ex. And I don't know if she's right or not, I still contemplate there's got to be something I just hurt her feelings and I feel bad that i'm trying to talk to her about stuffs and she'll understand what i'm going through. And I heard her."
252.0,Provider,"I would a. supporter. I would just tell her, even though I thought, a lot about what you said, and you are probably 100% right. It wasn't just one element, and it was you know I bet you, it was more than one. So instead of holidays turning into something that's supposed to be a loving nurturing family, you know event, it was it turned into an all out brawl and they're all ella there are elements that factors in it. But what sticks out to you the most. Is your X."
13640.0,Patient,yeah.
252.0,Provider,It doesn't mean there's not other elements and maybe she just reminded you that there were other negatives that were sitting there too.
13640.0,Patient,You know.
252.0,Provider,"i'm sure that they all played a factor, you know definitely but you lived with him, day in and day out, so it was more than just the holiday, it was a continuing thing that you've dealt with with him."
13640.0,Patient,"Oh yeah I hate football well watch a football, no, no matches in my house. You. know I used to get my ass beat if they want I get my ass beat if they didn't win. football. You still weren't watching it live that's not a problem. watching in my house you nope nope."
252.0,Provider,"yeah i'm not a big fan either, but you think about those things, and the thing that you want to do that, I would suggest that you do. This year I would go to my partner and say hey you know what. I becoming more aware of our holiday routine. And let's change it up a little bit this year. let's make it what it is supposed to be. You know if you're if you're bothered by something you're grumpy you're in a bad mood. distance yourself just a little bit Okay, and then come back in when you're feeling better let's appreciate the fact that we get to create this holiday to be whatever we want it to be, and we want it to be a good one, we need to replace all the bad ones. and have good in our repertory you know what I mean. We need that book, not to be all negative about the holiday season, but really about what it's supposed to be about. You know, and you guys come together, you know as as a team. You know there's nothing wrong with asking that but we've gotten into these patterns. Right Christmas gets close we start Dreading it off air right and the more that dread comes, the more the old memories come, the more you know all of these other things come up, but the great part about it. Is that we get to create new ones we get to create things that are way better than what we ever experienced before. that's our choice that's what's in our power. Right. You don't have to have a Turkey, you can have a ham you don't have to have a hand, you can have pizza."
13640.0,Patient,yeah that's true you know. Not about.
252.0,Provider,"The belly hey. it's your tradition, you don't have to watch, you know. God, what does that show that they show every freakin year. they've done it for my whole 54 years alive. my daughter."
13640.0,Patient,"dark on a Christmas story, we have to have it on in the background, every Christmas it drives my partner Greens."
252.0,Provider,"Why can't you do something different. Why can't it be something. happy and fun and laughing. What would he suggest people are in the background. will be something that he would like to you know to be able to be paying attention to something that's funny not football but something that's funny. Right. And that's the great part about it, we get so stuck in the routines of the traditions and everything else that they turn into being a pain in the butt. Right, but if we change our mindset about it and say you know what we have to create this, however, we want. This is what I would like to see change what would you like to see change and you ask your daughter, what would you like to see different and let's implement those differences in this Christmas."
13640.0,Patient,yeah.
252.0,Provider,And that. makes.
13640.0,Patient,For a happy Christmas yeah. yeah.
252.0,Provider,Instead of the old are aggressively to. write.
13640.0,Patient,About bad memories so.
252.0,Provider,"So. The only way to to combat bad memories, just like that thoughts is create new ones. And it's within our power. To be able to do that. dude last thanksgiving think we had pizza."
13640.0,Patient,it's like.
252.0,Provider,"I came to the same conclusion we don't have to have Turkey we don't have to have you know we don't have to stay home we don't have to not stay home, we can make it whatever we want to be get. And that's what we started doing. Because the connection to the holidays was dread and fear and up can can it hurry up and get over with. yeah right that's not. Oh, and this is supposed to be happy, this is supposed to be about a celebration. Right. This is supposed to be about understanding that all the good that's happening in your life with all the bad that's happening in the world. it's about recognizing the good things that you have going in your life and loving the people that you're closest to. You know. So that is my suggestion I am on this whole change. change this shit."
13640.0,Patient,yeah.
252.0,Provider,The name working anymore oh.
13640.0,Patient,yeah if he gets into a crappy mood all. Definitely talk to him and see what would make them happier because it's his Christmas too.
252.0,Provider,"yeah he's part of it too. And if I were in your shoes I would approach them before and say okay let's get together a game plan all right, because it was suggested to me that we tried to do things differently let's create our own happy memories on this holiday. I know that you know i'm very aware that you don't like this show on TV so let's change it, what are some of the things that you can do you know that you suggest that maybe we try. Except football so."
13640.0,Patient,"Look, for."
252.0,Provider,"Something happy, something you know what I mean funny um and again ask their opinions ask them to to their input and implement those little changes. takes away stress. dread. yeah you know and every time any negative thought or memory comes up you say you. know what. This is a whole new year. we're taking this year out this whole shitty year that it has been. we're taking it out with a happy being. Because next year is going to be amazing. that's my motto. has to be better than this year."
13640.0,Patient,I could stay away from catching a case i'd be doing really good.
252.0,Provider,they're working hard at it.
13640.0,Patient,"i'm trying night i've told a couple people look I would love to counteract what is going on right now but I don't need another case I want this to be over and done with and when that's over and done with thing you can talk to me about pulling another fucking thing, but right now. i'm keeping my nose clean."
252.0,Provider,"they're not so and i'll tell you what. When you learn how to control what you can control. and not try to control what you can't control right you've always been the fixer for everybody, so they're going to come to Laura and say hey you know what this is going on and it's an unjust. And so Laura is going to stand up and be you know that fighter for him, but laura's got to stand back and be a fighter for herself right now yeah. that's what's most important, you are the most important person in the room. You have to become the most important person in your world right now. period. And maybe you can tell them how to walk through it in a healthy manner. Instead of."
13640.0,Patient,My wall of stuff i've got this list of things to do next time there's an issue and I just. I need to just stay calm stay out of other people's business but there's a list so next time somebody comes in screaming in the room i'm going to stop right there and read that little list i've got written down.
252.0,Provider,"Exactly, and you know, understanding and knowing that not everything can be fixed and you don't have to fix everybody else's stuff you can support them, you can love them through it, you can be their ears. You can be the person that they hug. But it's not for your it's not yours to fix. You know. I totally get it, you know he because of that little girl inside and because of the little girl not having those people to defend her like she was supposed to have. me become that person right we become all of a sudden we're defending anything and everybody. All the while that little girls still in there feeling insecure."
13640.0,Patient,Oh yeah.
252.0,Provider,"So you got to make her feel secure Laura. And do some other things, to help with your sleep. Try putting on or taking a shower turning off all the lights dark you can put on. Go to YouTube and look up sleep meditations try to put one on there is this one oh my God there's this one guy I have his CDs his name is eckart totally. And I started listening to him when I went to sleep, because you know subconsciously what he was doing was putting good affirmations in my brain, but his voice was so monotone that it knocked me out right away. It was so boring."
13640.0,Patient,"You said I love the show. Well it's called what what are they calling it now they changed the name to an expedition whatever with josh whatever his name is and the first show, he was on used to be on hulu and hulu used to run all night long. So that was what I would put on his his show. start to finish, I don't know how many times I slept through it and his voice, along with the pot, or whatever medication, I was trying to take his voice would just make me go well and i'd be asleep like within the hour. Then they took it off of you hulu and how he doesn't play all night long they keep you know cuz streaming is expensive. yeah oh yeah. Really pissed me off when they took cuz he just he would just chat and stuff about whatever the hell, it was going on and it's. Like no voice and I still hear his voice now and it's like oh."
252.0,Provider,"boring invoice there it is. I want to see something really fast. i'm. You got to hear this guy. Art holy weird name to. alright. Now the guide to spiritual enlightenment by I could totally. published by publishing a new world library Nevada California. You are here to enable the divine purpose of the universe to unfold. That is how important you are. No i'm Connie hello, the publisher of the power of now in Canada and i'm sitting here with eckhart tolle a. So immediately collapsed, just as, if a blog has been called out of an inflatable taller. than my true nature as President I am. consciousness it's pure state prior to identification with form. Later I also done to go into that inner guidance from."
13640.0,Patient,Very little inflection. Just it doesn't move it.
252.0,Provider,"doesn't move. And so it doesn't have that. That. excitement that comes up you know when other people talk. um but that's definitely something that you can do you can look there on YouTube and find sleep meditations. And just really focus your mind put yourself in your happy place. Right practice, some of the things that we've been practicing like checking in with with each part of your body, making sure that it's relaxed. And something else that I do. When I can't sleep if i'm worrying about two and three and four different things I envision in my brain a hallway. And each side of the hallway or doors. And I will each thing that i'm worried about I will put in there and tell them go good night's sleep slam the door The next thing good night is time good asleep. slam until all of the things that i'm thinking about ruminating about worried about are in their own room and then I am visualized myself going and climbing into bed taking a deep breath and saying it's time for rest. and Talk about sleeping peaceful. Really, because you're doing it in your mind right that's where all the struggle comes from is our mind. And the craziest part about everything, is that we have more control of our brain than we ever imagined. we've just got to utilize that power and say I can do this. I don't need to worry about you right now I need to sleep. good night. That i'm not telling you that it was there were moments that it wasn't hard. Because I envisioned myself on a few of those doors chaining the door, because it kept wanting to come out. Right. But I stayed true to what my purpose was, and that was to get some rest. Go chain that door and then fall into whatever it is that you choose to put on that you're listening to. And let your body relax. time for rest and see if that doesn't doesn't help with you going to sleep getting to sleep. You know."
13640.0,Patient,Anything else I mean.
252.0,Provider,"Just don't have the mindset, if you go into doing it with the mindset it's never going to work. i'll try it but it's not going to work."
13640.0,Patient,"Well then, i'm just setting myself up for failure."
252.0,Provider,Exactly exactly you go in and you say this is going to work it's going to help me get some rest. So you do it with that intent and you have to believe it too.
13640.0,Patient,that's going to take some practice. yeah I know i've always always have trouble sleeping being able to relax and shutting my brain off.
252.0,Provider,"So instead of sitting, you know what i've always have problems sleeping. When you start this process when you do it say Intel now."
13640.0,Patient,or humans.
252.0,Provider,"right nor humans. This has to stop, when I need some rest."
13640.0,Patient,likes it would.
252.0,Provider,Just try that. The goal would be for you to get a good night's rest and wake up tomorrow be miss spring chicken happy and.
13640.0,Patient,"You know, remember the two or three times this year that I actually woke up feeling like that. Really fucked up part is I can actually remember the two or three days, where I woke up the next day going. pretty good. Two weeks right. Now."
252.0,Provider,It goes right back because why. We go right back into that ruminating state.
13640.0,Patient,yeah he just shut up.
252.0,Provider,"So it's just about changing the our thought process and saying you know there's nothing in the past, right now, that you can change nothing. it's you know those chapters they've been written and the longer that you stay back there, the more they have a hold on you. This is about staying in now, in the present moment."
13640.0,Patient,yeah.
252.0,Provider,"Not worrying about the future, but just saying today on this day. i'm going to do this differently. For today."
13640.0,Patient,"Today I get to go grocery shopping in a little while with my partner that'll be. irritating. he's. he's fun to hang out with. it's just. When I first met him, he told me if you give me $1 and I spend a buck 50 I am just the opposite."
252.0,Provider,You.
13640.0,Patient,"know we don't need that either. he's putting the shipping carton and letting him because you know it's his money and. Bringing It cannot, and I, you know cuz I would give them. You know, when I was working it's just here do something with it because i'm busy working. yeah and you know, he would. Just and it's like Where are you putting that because he wants it. Why should I hire you because I know how I am."
252.0,Provider,I can.
13640.0,Patient,"go the other way drastically bad you know, so it when we go shopping. It can be interesting, sometimes. yeah. that's one thing we don't agree on, but."
252.0,Provider,But this is okay so he's the one that's fitting the bill for the grocery shopping.
13640.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
252.0,Provider,"Let him buy whatever you know what I mean okay so that's the one that's not a need. Okay. All right, you know what I mean no fun go to that grocery store and make it fun. enjoy yourself laugh at him. Right. yeah have a great time don't think about the people don't think about the crazy focus strictly on what you're doing God, I have to do that all the time, focus on what i'm doing, because if not, people will drive me crazy do."
13640.0,Patient,I really hate some people.

252.0,Provider,"buy the life that you've led by that little girl inside of you that has faced so much trauma it's not even funny this is how everybody in my world is treating me has treated me my whole life, so why wouldn't I treat me that same way."
13640.0,Patient,yeah.
252.0,Provider,When we place.
13640.0,Patient,"I get that that makes sense because yeah because I never acted as smart, as I was especially around men. And then, once I did it was like you're weird. So I bought I wouldn't I call me an enigma that's like I know the meaning of the word, but where does that come from. yeah so yeah once I decided Fuck you guys i'm just gonna be me, you know i'm not as dumb as I asked you guys to me to be but yeah."
252.0,Provider,But remember okay. Remember that back in our day that's what it was all about it was about you know we're seeing we're not heard. You know and follow we don't lead we. You know guys are afraid of independent powerful women.
13640.0,Patient,"My daughter's got had trouble up until recently last few years, finding somebody that would accept her one day even told her i'm afraid to you. What do you need me for no she doesn't need you mofo."
252.0,Provider,"that's the thing. might be happy that you're wanted. yeah you know be happy that you're wanted don't be pissed off because you're not needed. Right society's not women to stand up on our own two feet yeah you know. And that's the thing, and it does scare it scares people. You know words I have been thought about as these shriveled up. Little babies that can't do anything for her so reality, you know we probably we probably went through more than a guy could ever think of. Because of a guy. maniacs and parents, you know."

13640.0,Patient,that's been the last second week.
252.0,Provider,"Well, again, your sleep spin off. No hungry angry lonely tired. Okay, when we are in one of those states, you know it can spiraling down into believing that holy crap I don't want to face the world today."
13640.0,Patient,"Somewhere i've been feeling, you know. It was."
252.0,Provider,All the past Christmases that were shit. So you get to create one this year that isn't.
13640.0,Patient,nobody's gonna get drunk and stupid it hasn't happened for a really long time.
252.0,Provider,"You got to keep telling yourself, please, I am safe, this is my Christmas to be had. We get to create this."
13640.0,Patient,"Did you talk snot to change your subject, because I know I do um did you talk to the E m Dr lady."
252.0,Provider,"I got an email, she said that she wanted she wanted to wait."
13640.0,Patient,"yeah I think and that's partially my decision because, as soon as she said that I just can sound silly but as soon as she said that I would have to. see her only and not see you anymore, or at least for the time being, I guess, I had a look on my face because she backpedal a couple steps. And it's like, no, no, no, you know, and I explained to her things are working, but I feel like especially right now at Christmas time. I don't feel like i'm far enough along."
252.0,Provider,Okay.
13640.0,Patient,"To deal with it just yet, I need more. I need more under me it feels like. it's a fee, I mean I don't know I just feel like if I started that I would lose where i'm at now I don't know."
252.0,Provider,"You wouldn't lose where you're at and the fear is justified, but it's a process when you go through em Dr and one thing you've got to know more is i'm not going anywhere. But. At some point, when you feel better able to be able to walk through it. you'll see her for a little while but to be right back with me."
13640.0,Patient,"Okay, all right that just terrified me it's like wait a minute I finally figure out some shit i'm getting better and you want to take the one person I can set indexation to no, no, no, no, wait no back up a minute. yeah if I can know that that will be okay, and then we'll be back to our usual stuff after the FDR is over, then it's like okay after the first of the year, maybe i'll give it a try, but right now i'm just like i'm I feel like i'm still a mess i'm learning. But i'm still a mess, you know and and I want to get to the point where Okay, we can do this, one more thing. One more thing."
252.0,Provider,"Can I tell you you're not as much of a mess, as you think you are. I feel like it's."
13640.0,Patient,yeah.
252.0,Provider,But feelings aren't facts.
13640.0,Patient,that's true.
252.0,Provider,"And so you actually I mean you're taking suggestions you're doing what I asked you to do, and yes, you are progressing. This piece this em Dr piece, it is a big piece. it's a big piece of your healing It really is, and once you have that under your belt you're going to know exactly what i'm talking about and there's a freedom that. So no the. First of the air will deal with it later."
13640.0,Patient,yeah I can do it right now.
252.0,Provider,"let's work on you, having the best Christmas that you could possibly have. let's work on today."
13640.0,Patient,Right.
252.0,Provider,"Okay, so when you go to the grocery store, you have a blast don't don't put yourself in that state of picking everything apart, but rather than Okay, I find my i'm picking everything apart, I need to stop breathing. it's Okay, that you have that it's okay that you do that. it's okay. And you could even talk to him about in the store about what are some things you'd like to see change about Christmas. what's going to help you and promote you to be in a better mood for it. How can we help you right."
13640.0,Patient,Like that yeah i'll bring it up.
252.0,Provider,"And then you guys can discuss it. and see what you know, he says, I, like the fact that you listen to your daughter. On her perception and her thoughts about it. And he brought it to the table today. Because you can know that there can always be more than one truth to a situation right and that's her truth doesn't make it wrong. But it does expand your thoughts about other people's experiences at Christmas. It wasn't a jab it wasn't taken don't take it personal because it's not personal."
13640.0,Patient,She has direct your feelings.
252.0,Provider,"This is about saying hey there's other elements to, and you know, sometimes will protect other people we won't recognize their behavior. So she's just made me aware that there were other people there too."
13640.0,Patient,yeah.
252.0,Provider,And what a great thing for her to be able to do that.
13640.0,Patient,"Yes, she. she's I must not be that threatening because she's able to say something I guess."
252.0,Provider,yeah you open the door for that.
13640.0,Patient,I just want to get better I mean. She hated me when I was an Al anon she hated she hated the way I was and I went on like oh let's tell you kept me sane. don't want her to hate me. I don't want her to hate me cuz i'm trying to get better I don't want her to feel like.
252.0,Provider,"that's why it's important that you asked her opinion and you don't take offense to it yeah sometimes you know it's gonna hurt a little bit. yeah but you take it and you think about it, any process it. And you allow her to own it her her own feelings. You support her feelings and again asked her what are some of the things that you'd like to see different we want this to be an awesome Christmas new memories, need to be built."
13640.0,Patient,Do.
252.0,Provider,"You know how can we do that on your eyes tell me some things, and you can support it by saying you know, sometimes it's hard to hear the truth. Sometimes the truth isn't pretty. But when you're able to process that truth, you see things from a different perspective. And that's what she gave you she gave you the gift of being able to see things from a different perspective. Remember that love her asked her opinion. And you guys just make it the best day ever. Okay."
13640.0,Patient,This is so fucking painful.
252.0,Provider,"yeah. It can be. But i'll tell you what, on the other side of pain is relief. happiness gratitude. Knowing that life really isn't doesn't have to be always paid. there's happiness joy there to."
13640.0,Patient,Go to find that. right one.
252.0,Provider,"can look for it instead of always looking for the negative, which is a go to what's what we do a society is there right now to. You know, but we've got to change our thoughts right. and realize yeah, and all this shit that's going on there's still goodness."
13640.0,Patient,"God, so when we're sitting here right before next Christmas. which I totally plan on doing."
252.0,Provider,you're going to be in a whole nother headspace next Chris remind me.
13640.0,Patient,i'm gonna have to be there's no other choice.
252.0,Provider,We become willing to change when it hurts too bad to stay the same.
13640.0,Patient,And that's what i've been feeling.
252.0,Provider,"So you're right where you need to be for this progression to happen if it was 10 years ago you probably wouldn't have been ready. or not, but you're in that headspace in that heart space where you're able to make these changes and take a look at these things. So give yourself. a pat on the back to that."
13640.0,Patient,I don't have to be my own worst enemy I don't have to pick on me.
252.0,Provider,you're strong vibrant. beautiful woman. That wants joy and happiness there's nothing wrong with that.

13640.0,Patient,No cuz we're still fighting.
252.0,Provider,"that's, it is the thing you know the minute that he knows his place, he quiets down and you're able to combat those negative thoughts with the truth, because he's filming a full of lies. And then that voice becomes the loudest the truth. Now what he's telling you. That he's worked for several years."
13640.0,Patient,On long time for as long as I can remember.
252.0,Provider,And he's been confirmed by people in your life right.

252.0,Provider,"But he's not working anymore, because you don't have that confirmation he doesn't have that confirmation. The wood that he's standing on is getting really brittle. And it's time that he sat down and shut the hell up."
