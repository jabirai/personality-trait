107.0,Provider,Hello.
6835.0,Patient,How are you.
107.0,Provider,Good you are in a different space.
6835.0,Patient,"I am yeah I am up in Toronto. And where i've been I guess for a week now and will be here through tomorrow. it's been a wild. We can have for us. We my youngest son. tested was he started feeling crummy I guess what was it Saturday the 16th. And so we tested him at home for Kobe and it was positive, unfortunately, and then we tested him with PCR tests and that was positive. So he's been. We decided to basically. Have I took my older son and the two of us wanted to talk to us so that we can effectively quarantine our younger son. and But we got up to tahoe and then two days later, my older son tested positive for Code as well, so managed to pick it up from the other one before he left town. But my wife and I are so far okay we've got a couple of negative test behind this already, but I certainly feel really crummy and I just do it add another coven tests morning. So I have a I have a suspicion that that i'm it may have broken through and that i've got some sort of mild symptoms associated with code infection, but we'll. we'll see clearly the vaccine is doing its job in one way in one way or the other, and while i'm like certainly operating at less than 100% i'm like not not doing that badly."
107.0,Provider,Okay well i'm glad to hear that.
6835.0,Patient,"yeah. So. yeah it's been a I guess a pretty eventful we can happen in that sense, and then usually we can have. yeah and and a pretty busy time for missions, I spoke spoke to you last. Which i'm not sure exactly, I think that would have been three weeks get today I guess we're stronger together regular schedule um so I don't I guess i've made some. made some interesting progress, probably in the last since we spoke last less than I might like but. You know one thing i've been doing. Really all summer in a sort of beginning in July and through wrap through now. Is that i've been reading the. Big book before going to bed. and And so. I. I sort of read the beginning of it, and then I read the end of it, which is actually most of the book of what I what I didn't spend a lot of time on yet or the actual 12 steps from selves. Which which I I I understand kind of high level what those steps are and and I do intend to read that but i'm also i'm also like. there's an element of that that I think is probably. Better. You know if sort of done with with some help with that with that with a sponsor if I didn't decide to go that route. But the for me, I, like, I was interested in kind of nonetheless consuming as much of that content is like because I could and. that's been I guess like interesting and really helpful like far far I don't I don't I don't need to make a comparison necessarily it's just been very helpful. The what I found most compelling are just sort of all of the all the stories and personal accounts that that folks you know included in that book and most of the stories are pretty dated. But but it's actually in that sense that they're kind of most powerful for me anyway because it's a you know these are accounts, written by people that are long since dad and and. That that lived at a different time and space and yet you know their experience and the things they describe are perfectly. described perfectly my own experience so that's what you hear people say about it but it's just been interesting to read that and sort of internalize those things and and. Understand as you and I have discussed before, just like just how universal this experiences. You know, it really. The the exact sort of. manifestation of it can differ a little bit by by person, depending on the person and the circumstances, but like thematically and and in terms of all of the major even physiological home it's it's it's. You know it's it's totally consistent across the board, which you know I guess you'd you'd sort of expect we're all humans reacting to the same substance and so you'd expect it to be consistent in some sense but it's just amazing sort of the the way the ways in which. It does manifest itself in people's lives and how consistent, they are and how like sort of how predictable and and. And how typical the problems are. So I don't know that's been that's been really good for me because it's sort of helped me. In a much more serious way just identify with the problem and. and recognize, you know I guess what I am or what I become or who I, who I, who I. Who I sit with in terms of like how I how I am how I react alcohol these days. And, and so that that's been really, really good because it's um I don't know it just sort of it's given me like in my own mind like it's like clarity and sort of like power over it in some sense because i'm. i'm not. I think it's difficult you can't read that stuff and then. rationally conclude that somehow it's going to be different for you. that that is what I have wanted to do on prior occasions and like you know when i've made bad decisions i've usually that's usually been part of the. rationale, even if implicit is like Oh well, this time, this time, that would be different for me, and I can I can handle it and you know, whatever that the thought processes there but it's mostly around sort of some sort of. Really unfounded belief that it's different for me and, if not different for me last time then certainly it'll be different for me this time and. that's just not the experience and I can like them like I just point to. You know episode after episode in my life. Where I either thought that going into it or or earlier in earlier stages of this where I wasn't even conscious of it, but where I can still I can still recognize that. You know I kind of started into the drinking episode and it just sort of follow the follow the same pattern that everybody goes through so. it's giving me power in the sense that I sort of I just sort of I can I recognize it, I think, better for what it is, and so, then I just give me power to sort of manage it, because there's not. If there's if there's ambiguity around it then then there's then it leaves room for interpretation and rationalization. And if there's not if there's not ambiguity around it then that's a lot harder to do and and so, if I look at all these stories and then I, and then I, and I spend the time, as I have to sort of relate those stories to my own stories, there is, there is no ambiguity here like. very clear what happens if I hit by. You know, as as as one of the guys wrote in his His story in it just reflecting on on on how powerful it is and how. How how predictable and strong that that that that the control of alcohol is he basically just said something something along the lines of like. You know, it only it only even though he's like considers himself recovered and hadn't had a drink in 10 years or something, you know that it It only takes them three quarters of an ounce of whiskey to get back to that spot and. And that so that's been like an interesting realization to its and I sort of now, I think, understand in a much better way what people when people talk about like the first rank being the most important one. That really that really is true because because you don't even need a full first right. Now you're just part of a first of the first drink and like you're like you're on your way you're on that path, and then you know you know you kind of come to four days later and it's just. So I you know you, you talked about it in terms of like playing the tape forward and I, and I that's a that's a an expression that really resonated with me and that I think about frequently. And I can do that with my own experiences, and so I can sort of like I now, I think I can do that with a lot of accuracy, but then also from that. recognize that recognize that that is the inevitable consequence that there's not a different outcome I can't I can't expect a different outcome that's the inevitable consequence for me and for everybody else that's in that place and so. That gives me the power to make that choice up front like oh I don't want that outcome and so i'm not going to make that. So that's been really good for me and I guess. You know I i've been sort of I don't know underlining are highlighting passages that I thought were sort of interesting and were particularly. Relevant for me or or that really moved me. And I even you know kind of took the time to transcribe some of those into my own notes and. And so that that I think has been helpful it occurs to me that. For a couple of reasons I might like actually sort of try to write my own little narrative. Of the style that i've seen in the in the book. And you know my my The purpose of that would be twofold one is just like to continue dwelling on the this these issues and. force myself to sort of put into writing the things that i'm sort of the conclusions i'm reaching the interpretations that I that i'm that i'm making steps, the first one, the second is. I am kind of you and i've talked about this before I am concerned about like. All of this is sort of like relatively fresh for me right now. You know the worst of it is all happened in the last two or three years, my most recent you know relapse was in July, just three months ago, and so I kind of. You know I kind of want to get down on paper, my thoughts around this while it's still powerful and vivid. Because I don't. I know, with the passage of time, I know this about myself I know this from all of the accounts i've read that, like the tendency is going to going to be this sort of remember it differently remember it less negatively than it was. To read to rationalize that now i'm in a better place and i'm better equipped to handle it and all that kind of stuff which I just I just know isn't true it's just not that I wish it were true, everybody wishes true it's not true. So I, so I feel like there'd be there'd be a lot of use in that, if I could could could create. Some sort of and and I don't I don't mean to like suggest that needs to be some like super formal thing at all, I think this is, in essence, you know a lot of ways. it's no more complicated than what you suggested, a year ago we started talking, which is just like take the time to put in writing, and so it could just be. could just be a journal doesn't need i'm not not suggesting that it needs to be something different than that, but I do want to like I guess I guess what what I want to be different about it is like I do want to take the time to like actually. bring to life, some of those episodes that I experienced on my own as a reminder for myself kind of where I was and how bad it was. And and and I want to sort of also like take the time to sort of like in every one of these stories like. Some some of these folks to deal with it more explicit than others, but they always kind of talk about this Arc that they were on and it's like this slow steady thing and so people sort of don't realize what's happening to them in the moment and I certainly did. But, but in retrospect, and and and after being sort of having some silver. Reflection on it like it's very it's very clear, I can like sort of map out that course that I was on, and so I want to just like put that down on paper as sort of a permanent reminder to myself, something that I can like always go back and revisit. To if I if I begin to lose sight of that or or you know rationalize that i've like somehow move past all this. So I don't know, let me stop there, that that's a I realized, maybe i've made more progress than I realized in the last few weeks."
107.0,Provider,"Well, you always talk about the you've not made enough progress, and then you process, and then you get to a place where you have an understanding that you've made some progress, so at some point you're going to appreciate your progress in the moment or at the time, as opposed to. The initial beat up and then reflection."
6835.0,Patient,yeah.
107.0,Provider,So there's that.
6835.0,Patient,there's that I could do probably do a better job of doing that in in general.
107.0,Provider,"Well that's your team right you acknowledging that you can do a better job, welcome to humanity we're not 100%. Please perfect we all have stuff to work on, so I think that's My point is that you know if you for acknowledging that you are making an intention not to connect to something when you know you quote unquote should that's different than. Your human being, in an effort, and as long as you feel like you're putting in your best effort that's What matters, but your best effort has to be balanced with all the other things that you have efforts in you can't put in a percent on this because you're a husband and a father and. You have work to do, and you have all these other obligations in life, so you have to find the balance and all of that yeah. So, are you keeping an improper bank balance or you intentionally ignoring it or putting it on the back burner, that is your question to ask yourself every day. yeah which leads me nicely into the 12 steps. If you look at the narratives of those stories, they all follow the 12 step process which is they all acknowledge that their lives become powerless and unmanageable that they recognize they had an accountability to something bigger than themselves. That they did an inventory of the things that really were disruptive in their life they recognize the character defects. And what they want to do about it, they recognize who needs the amends and how that played out and who they didn't make amends to because it was going to be hurtful to them. And then the maintenance steps. Which is how did I do today, did I give it up to a bigger power or did I kind of keep myself accountable. So. If you work the 12 steps. Even if you didn't have a sponsor just to look at the bigger picture, you will have an appropriate. connection to what you've been dealing with and then each time you work them you get a better connection a better understanding as this true life, but I do think that this idea of wanting to kind of write it down, you should follow the 12 step model."
6835.0,Patient,mm hmm.
107.0,Provider,"and lay it out and struggle with that a little bit, and you can do it in a narrative format, or you can do the steps in in. In a you know bullet form and then create a narrative from that as like here's the synopsis of the story. And then continue to kind of go back and reflect and it gives you a place to land every time you think about oh there's something I remember that that should that live in my inventory that live in a character flaw should that lives in my amends section that's. The Nice part about is it gives you the frame of reference to organize. The whole thing and to recognize the purpose of all, it is a bigger piece accountability and an acknowledgement of your story."
6835.0,Patient,"yeah. Well that's that's a great suggestion I think it probably is not probably it definitely would be a good framework for that and. yeah it's sort of. As you say that. I. realized that there, there are sort of there are two different. arcs that i'm referring to. And there, I want to spend time on both but they're sort of I think you're talking about sort of the arc of recovery, which is what i'm working on right now and what I was talking about is like the arc of dissent, you know my my."
107.0,Provider,"inner circle, to tell part of it."
6835.0,Patient,For sure.
107.0,Provider,"For sure, and things."
6835.0,Patient,yeah.
107.0,Provider,yeah only as strong as your weakest link.
6835.0,Patient,"For sure I, and I guess men, I said I think about the different things in the sense that they are different from a chronological perspective, but I also appreciate that what you're saying is that they're there, they are that they're further to completely linked."
107.0,Provider,"They are, and it would deny your moments of struggle, when you were trying to be in recovery when you work. And I think that that is dismissive of our human process, you know, we are not linear and we can very much have a mindset of wanting to be better when we're not being better. And do not acknowledge that struggle is to be dismissive of the struggle and that those struggle moments are key to your next steps of being able to make different choices. You can't we don't just. snap a finger and everything's different, we have a pre contemplated State that is messy and. And non uniform and very pejorative. And then it can coalesces into a contemplate of state where you can really kind of say wow something's not right here this doesn't feel good anymore, but you're still in the actions. And it's only until you get to the action state of change that you actually start to really make the changes, but if we dismiss those other two stages. we're missing a half the picture."
6835.0,Patient,What we remind me if you would please like what what how you organize that what were the.
107.0,Provider,What are the stages that Yuri contemplation. contemplation. yeah action. And then maintenance is the last stage one would argue that there's always. kind of an active maintenance versus a passive maintenance can be two parts. hmm some days are harder than others.
6835.0,Patient,"yeah that's interesting. yeah I think I think I get, for I think I get what you mean by active maintenance well how would you what would you like, could you give me from your perspective of example of. Passive maintenance and active maintenance."
107.0,Provider,"mm hmm so as a father, there are certain things you just do you don't have to think about it."
6835.0,Patient,mm hmm.
107.0,Provider,"And then there are other things you have to make a point to do like going to tahoe to create a quarantine situation to provide. You know, a different situation didn't quite work out those very mentioned active engaged. To kind of disrupt life, a little bit with the positive intention didn't quite work out the way you wanted it to but you know your day to day had to be disrupted and then in your day to day there's going to be things that you make an active choice to engage in versus. You breathe in and out you don't even think about it really."
6835.0,Patient,"yeah yeah. That makes sense conceptually and like sort of the definition definition that's that's sort of passive and active. i'm just trying to think about again in your your analogies a good one in terms of how that applies to me, being a father i'm just trying to think about like what that would how that would apply to this topic around. recovery in particular. You may."
107.0,Provider,"not have much of a passive state right now. Because you're still very active it's just that your level of activity is not as intense as it was when you were initially making the efforts. And so, instead of becoming a dry drunk who doesn't pay attention to these things you're trying to find a place of getting. Passive maintenance, where you don't have to actively engage all the time, and that means you have to go through a process of action. 12 ups writing your story laying it out, so that you have something that you hold on to to keep the maintenance alive."
6835.0,Patient,"mm hmm. yeah. Okay yeah, I guess, I guess, I am very much. I am very much active i'm totally in that mode. i'm like actively about all this stuff. And I do sometimes i've been it's been. helpful and encouraging to actually see myself sometimes. Just naturally slip into a passive mode, but with the correct the correct passive passive mode where like i'm i'm like i'm making healthy decisions without actually having to think about it consciously very much just because it's. Just huge be."
107.0,Provider,yeah I began to recognize some training.
6835.0,Patient,yeah.
107.0,Provider,In training in place.
6835.0,Patient,"yeah i'm going to just one second i've got a gap here my son coming up the search a second. Okay sorry about that. i'm not alone, one on one with finnegan and of course he's not in not in school, and they also don't have the remote learning infrastructure in place anymore than."
107.0,Provider,This.
6835.0,Patient,They dismantled all that when the kids went back to school this year so he's basically twiddling his thumbs and. yeah it's not it's.
107.0,Provider,"Kansas, the devil's work."
6835.0,Patient,So I did get them plugged in with with his his kind of counselor this morning and they're going to connect in about. 10 minutes. But he's there's a limit to how self directed he can be as a 10 year old.
107.0,Provider,Oh yeah for sure there are limits of 50 year old so you know 10 is that much harder sometimes it's better just depends on the framers.
6835.0,Patient,"True true. yeah so sorry for the interruption but yeah I think we're like I I I am seeing these like these, like little glimmers for sure where like. The passive aspect of it is is sort of naturally taking over which is, which is great because it's also it's also supporting this like very healthy path that i'm on which is that, like. With each day that goes by, and with as I sort of reinforced the good habits and the good decision making. Then it becomes a little more passive a little more maintenance oriented a little less active and that's I think over the long term pretty critical, because what it's doing is it's like it's it's opening up my cognitive capacity to work on other stuff. Like I really i'm going to have a period of time here, which has really been over the last year. and, especially, you know I guess in in a couple months before I met you and in the several months after I made you where I kind of had just had to shut down everything else, and just only work only work on that and, like make every every moment was active. that's right and it. And it felt like it felt sort of all consuming. It is yeah it is, it is doing and I think I didn't really even understand what was happening at the time, though, I think I think you definitely encouraged me in the right ways to like it's okay to let everything else sort of fall away. yeah so I did I did that, and it was really good. I think it sort of probably confused my wife in some sense or like she I don't think she just understand what was happening. Because I didn't even understand but. it's. I, I guess, I now it's just it's a different way for me to recognize what was going on, that it is sort of like this, hopefully natural and steady. Progress from like emergency active triage type behavior to you know slowly slow and steady moving myself more into a maintenance state."
107.0,Provider,"Yes, but I think it's important at this point, and I said it before i'll say it again, this is a difference. taking time to process at this level now owning your stone story owning choices made before and now. And really. Connecting to that is a significant part of shifting to a positive active state versus a white knuckling dry drunk state. So people who don't drink but don't do the work that's who I would classify as a dry drunk somebody who is just white knuckling it and that's admirable there's something to that i'm not discounting it but it's it's. it's exhausting and an unnecessary way they are literally just holding on to the edge of a ledge."
6835.0,Patient,mm hmm.
107.0,Provider,"Which is a ton of work, I know from rock climbing that's a ton of work but it's you don't need you can just put your feet on another piece of rock. and pull yourself up and do some reflection you don't need to just hang there in a state of exhaustion the whole time who's at some point of fatigue out lose."
6835.0,Patient,"So yeah for sure that it's also. yeah absolutely and I sort of i've i've sort of i've crossed over a number of times in the last year between like you know falling off the cliff hanging on by a white knuckling it and then being on solid footing and I moved back and forth across. That a few a few different times and like I mean I guess the blessing, is that I know what it feels like to be on solid ground and. And so it's it's not like, there was a point in time, and I can see this with other people as well we're like it wasn't clear that I could have moved beyond just the white knuckling part of it. yeah and now that now that's like that's abundantly clear and say."
107.0,Provider,yeah and now.
6835.0,Patient,"It is huge so yeah you're right and I don't want to lose like. Like side of the. Country progress there. Because now I can look at it objectively, I think, and and like just recognize how how silly and what like what an extraordinary waste of energy, it is to like try to exist in that white knuckle state."
107.0,Provider,But again let's not dismiss it with the word silly because if you didn't have those moments you wouldn't be here.
6835.0,Patient,that's true.
107.0,Provider,it's all part of this process and I think for you changing your definition or understanding or appreciation of progress is a big picture item.
6835.0,Patient,hmm.
107.0,Provider,"How you start every session. And it is important for you to acknowledge it and I validate that I think that that's. I agree, but. You you're kind of stuck in wanting to be. negative about your progress, as opposed to acknowledging your progress, you always kind of come back to it and quicker and quicker, which is good but. I think it's another reason why it's going to be so important for you to do the 12 steps do your narrative because it helps you appreciate your progression. And that every step does matter even the ones that are painful and ugly and in fact oftentimes and you'll appreciate this from an athletic training standpoint it's the really ugly moments of push that are critical to the next level of training in those moments, they are ugly and uncomfortable. Critical to the next layer of. You know, training and strength."
6835.0,Patient,"yeah i'm sure not a couple not sure. yeah okay that's great um. I hadn't. I hadn't really begun to process, how the 12 steps themselves could sort of fit into all of this, and so. This is great, you certainly helped me do that and I. really efficient way in a really efficient way. I just sort of. Close the book last night. sort of metaphorically since it's on the kindle but. The. kind of read all those narratives and we're sort of preparing to go back now and look at the but in the 12 steps and and I think now have more inspiration to do that. So I think that's a great next step, actually, because I am finding that like. sort of doing doing this on my own terms and a little more privately is kind of what works for me. And that's that's not the least bit surprising because that's kind of how I process everything you know, like if I you know if i've got an important work project like i'm going to get to the best outcome if I just sit down and clear my desk and I work on it independently. And that's, not to say it's not say I don't benefit from like touching base with other people that are involved in the same way that i'm doing here with you, but like the real progress happens in isolation, for me."
107.0,Provider,A monk and spirit.
6835.0,Patient,"I am no doubt. So yeah so that so that's good I mean, I think. it's I mean this this whole journey has been so revealing in so many respects, but that's that's one of them to it's just it's sort of helped me reveal like how. You know what are the ways in which I I I personally kind of can make the most progress on on these things. So that it's good I, and I think this this framework, you know, is a it's obviously a proven one and it's um. it's one that that I i'm going to do in any case, and then I have we've talked about like I have my I have my. reservations about. I don't want to just I don't want say like a broadly speaking, I just like I had have some reservations about like how whether like going. and doing that in the context of meetings at the moment is like if if that's like the best use of what limited time I have to devote to this or not, and there, you know that that we could debate that for days but. The. The the essence of it, the basic framework of it, the the journey that that everybody goes through, there is is. sort of I think it's sort of the value in it is indisputable, or at least i'll just say that I will dispute the value of it. And so I want to work through it and I may decide that after doing that that it also makes sense to like. ratchet things up a little bit and work through it again with the sponsor and you know I don't know I mean i'm sort of i'm sort of discovering as we go along here that, like, I have been able to. consolidate the gains that i've made in and i'm stronger and I have more capacity to deal with this and and so i'm pretty open minded about like what future steps in that progress could look like."
107.0,Provider,"I think your biggest challenge to the 12 steps and to 12 step meetings is the higher power element. That has been. Your previous block, so I would acknowledge that it's not about a higher power it's about accountability just something outside of yourself. So when you look at that, in the 12 step process if you can replace the verbiage with accountability to something outside of yourself, then you can work through that easier."
6835.0,Patient,"yeah. yeah Okay, I mean that's I think. Second, on this. yeah I think that's I think that's I think that's very well sad and great advice. That is probably a very effective and practical way to sort of move forward on this and make progress. There is a like a like a broader, more fundamental question i'm sort of wrestling with which is sort of like just higher power."
107.0,Provider,Questions in general that.
6835.0,Patient,"People that people have sort of independent of what's called the 12 steps yeah you know i'm like i'm sort of at that. stage of life, I think, where those kinds of questions are like more prominent than they've ever been. And, and so, like you know that's like I don't know i've sort of. been working more passive passively but i've been working in some sense for a long time on on that. You know, I was, I was raised, I was raised in a pretty religious household and. You know sort of I think early in life, like believed in absolute terms. That you know, there was a God and that. You know that that I was accountable to a higher power and that I would be judged and all that stuff i've. i've moved away from that sort of steadily over a long period of time. I am certainly. I guess i'm not. i'm not an atheist. I do believe there's some higher power I just I don't have my own concept camp for what I believe that really is or how how I would relate to it. And I know I know that I know that i'm not going to lead a life that that involves like dogmatic adherence to. Some the Christian doctrine and the Bible in particular i'm not i'm not going to do that. But. I do think there's some place in my life for acknowledgement of and some some form of relationship with whatever I can see, to be a higher power."
107.0,Provider,"Good. The reason I say good is because i've only seen and i'm not 192 years old, although sometimes I can feel that way and I haven't been doing this for a million years. But I have worked with a lot of people and the people who are willing to develop their spiritual self and be accountable to something outside of humanity or even just a bigger picture, regardless of what you define that is always do better. than people who are unwilling to look at that. If nothing else, I think it's a. it's an obstacle that they continue to trip over and choose not to resolve and so that's always going to be an energy sink like a sink sink, you know. it's going to be disruptive to your process, so if you're willing to at least look at things and deal with them and and in its own time and in its own fashion and it's, not to say that everything has to be done all at once, but. If there's a willingness to take stuff on and not allow any part of your existence to have some sort of black hole dark closet I don't go there. Then you will have a happier existence on the planet, when we shut this down and shut it off that's when things are toxic and when bitterness and frustration and anger. continue to prevail. So take the time this may, this is a lifelong. journey, but it is something that you should reconcile and with your. Nx with your folks and all the things that have gone on in the past year it's likely that that you know all of these things are somehow interconnected and. And that is something that is important for you as this true for all of us to develop your own sense of understanding and appreciation, regardless of how you were raised, you need to make your own adult. individual choices."
6835.0,Patient,"yeah. yeah it is all really there's no question. And I think. Maybe one thing i'm struggling with is that. I am I wouldn't say that it's like a black hole that's off limits, but. As I sort of like begin to contemplate these questions around. Higher power and accountability to someone else in the context of. You know alcoholic recovery, then it sort of naturally forces me to ask the question like. What kind of accountability Do I need to have to that higher power in other areas."
107.0,Provider,Go ahead.
6835.0,Patient,and am I prepared to do my prepared to do that.
107.0,Provider,"yeah I think that that's too much pressure, I think you need to separate it out, although I appreciate where you're going with that and it doesn't surprise me because you're an overachiever you're trying to do too much and too short of a time. You got a baby step this one. And that will come all of that other stuff will come in its natural time, if you allow yourself to to start at ground zero. And and do very slow methodical training in this place in your life."
6835.0,Patient,"yeah. yeah that's good advice um. I am. You know there's sort of I guess there's like an overachieving component of it there's also like there's also this broader sort of personality element of mine, that is, it play and which you know I recognize also was very much a play in my drinking problems. Which is that i'm like I am and have always been like an all or nothing kind of person. yeah and so i'm like i'm either out for i'm all in and. And when I when when I applied that philosophy to drinking, you know it led to a bad place, obviously."
107.0,Provider,You can hate all in and curiosity and that doesn't mean that you have to have it all the answers.
6835.0,Patient,"yeah it's a good way of putting it. yeah and I guess it's it's sort of. it's I guess it's sort of like giving myself permission to like explore at least this dimension of it. With without like. I definitely have this it's it's it's I think it's in some ways it's been helpful to me in my life, but in other ways it's like it's a flaw and it's it ends up being an obstacle. Like I just sort of I it's really important for me to have like. Intellectual consistency and defensive."
107.0,Provider,Oh yes.
6835.0,Patient,And so.
107.0,Provider,Your intelligence is the thing that guides you.
6835.0,Patient,"yeah yeah, and so I don't like the idea, for example, of like to like spell it out, I guess, like a flag. Saying that i'm going to try to be. positively accountable to a higher power as it relates to alcohol, but that i'm not quite prepared to process how i'm going to be accountable to that higher power on other issues like I because, in my mind goes to this place of like you're you either are or you are not. You know, accountable to that higher power you can't parse it like that."
107.0,Provider,"Except you've been spending your life person and all along, because you've been trying to say that you can manage i'll call and that you can control it, and that you know you've been kind of living this purse life for a while and it's created a lot of anger and frustration for you."
6835.0,Patient,"mm hmm, no doubt, no doubt, and then I think I think I have to like just have to recognize what I think is true about that situation, even if, even if it's a little uncomfortable, which is that. That it's okay like even even if i'm making progress, just in this one narrow area. And i'm not making progress let's say within these other areas that like. it's worth it just for the positive progress in that one area."
107.0,Provider,amen brother.
6835.0,Patient,"yeah. yeah, so I think it's I guess I need to go find a way to kind of. it'll take time or sure, but just like to become find peace with that."
107.0,Provider,"That is a lifelong endeavor for you, you are never going to be really comfortable with that idea."
6835.0,Patient,yeah.
107.0,Provider,"it's what pushes you right so it's so for every really great trait we have the there is a flip side, so the great part about you pushing yourself, is that you have achieved a lot of things, intellectually physically, there are a lot of fantastic things that you can check off boxes for. The downside to that is that that same push can get in the way you trip over yourself because you're trying to do it all, at one time and that's just we're human beings it's just we don't operate that way."
6835.0,Patient,yeah.
107.0,Provider,"So if you can get to a place where you can uncomfortably manage that, and it will always be an uncomfortable thing because that's the you know if you really gave it up, then you and push on the other side. So you're always going to have tension there."
6835.0,Patient,"yeah. yeah. Well, that makes sense and I guess i'm I am a little a little more energized on on this having talked through it with you. in the sense that i'm like I think I can like pretty actively like. choose not to be overwhelmed by the prospect of like you know this like massive like wholesale change that. I sort of feel I feel myself needing to make and instead just latch on to the progress that I am making and. She needs to continue to take those baby steps, because that is that is working, it is working. And I don't need I don't need to say we talked about like. How overwhelming, it can be to like suggests that you're never going to drink again whatever like it's a it is for the same thing."
107.0,Provider,"For me it is like I don't need to like I don't need to like it, I don't need to like."
6835.0,Patient,"get to the end state tomorrow, like I just need to actually do it seemed to work on it today."
107.0,Provider,"that's right, that is, the joy of that delightful and annoying phrase it one day at a time. and insult to injury, it works if you work if you work it. These patronized annoying phrases are frustratingly true as well."
6835.0,Patient,"yeah. yeah. yeah and I guess you know it's it's interesting as I reflect, as I have done for sure over the last couple months, especially. On like the journey over the last couple of years I that like that phrase was when I didn't I didn't begin to understand, two years ago. I some somewhere on the path of understanding there, but maybe not that far along but it's beginning it's beginning to make a lot more sense to me and and actually like. If if there is, if there are positive things about you know the the relapses that i've had that's among them that's among that the best is that, yes, it certainly is sort of this reminder that it's like it's it's not. it's not a. Like a flip the switch kind of thing and that. You know that I. That I shouldn't get overwhelmed with like. Trying to try to make it something that it's not but instead just you know recognize that i'm i'm in a better place if I make good decisions. And that I have today to do that and i'll make my good decisions today, and if I you know i'm able to build. build on that and string the days together, then that's great over time and that actually it's sort of i'm not using this as a good excuse for a relapse or anything like that, but it actually just takes the pressure off a little bit because."
107.0,Provider,We yeah because you're not white knuckling it your training.
6835.0,Patient,"yeah. yeah no the training analogy is a really good one and I didn't put it in terms that are quite that explicit or make that direct like analogy that you did, although I think it's highlighted that's really effective, especially for me I just I just recognize the like. Each day i'm a little more capable, a little a little stronger and I guess that's the essence that that is the essence of training. So yeah so I guess I am trained I am training and I I do feel that like. You know I. I really like that analogy, I actually just want to make. A special yeah right now. i'm going to come back to that, but I yeah I am training, I think. You know, on the athletic side i'm sort of in some sense i've never been in better shape than I am right now and that feels great. And I, and so I like i'm able to sort of tackle physical challenges with kind of you know more confidence than ever before, even though my body is it a sort of less able than it was earlier in my in my life. and The same is certainly certainly playing out on this on the disaster recovery path. Because I just. Like I just find myself that, as I get stronger each day that like as I find like get into these situations that before would have been really challenging for me. they're just not challenging for me anymore. The you know I like in the first in the first few months, like the idea I sit down to dinner, and like not have a drink was like an overwhelming sort of."
107.0,Provider,possibility.
6835.0,Patient,"yeah now that's now that's just sort of that's just that's just life, but like to the point where like I. You know i'll have like days or meals, where I don't even think about it, which would which, which was like unheard of you know, two years ago. So I yeah so I recognize that that i'm making that progress and actually to make another sort of connection here it's funny it's it is sort of like. I don't know I don't want to lose that fitness, which is how I, which is how I tackle like one day at a time on the physical athletic side is that is that, like hey That was my here's my day today is my day to like maintain that fitness and I don't want to lose that."
107.0,Provider,opportunity.
6835.0,Patient,or maintain or enhance that fitness and and so. If there is a gradual like one day at a time sort of aspect of that sort of comes naturally on that side and that I can probably apply effectively on the other.
107.0,Provider,yeah. he's what you know.
6835.0,Patient,"All right, well. That was a. Productive conversation yeah it was a long yeah it was really, really good I I came into the call not having done any prep work for it in terms of actual preparation for the conversation, but that was really good and I appreciate the. couple of really big takeaways I think from that conversation, so I think i'm good to leave it there, we can talk about."
107.0,Provider,"Okay man I follow up on, if you ever reached out to Dr to beat oh."
6835.0,Patient,"yeah you sure I have not yet I need to do that, in fact, I will put that on my list right now. yeah. fit that in. that's important for me to get back in touch with him and I yeah I owe him an update anyway, but I also I do want to kind of close the book on this just sort of the follow up that I promised to my my business partners."
