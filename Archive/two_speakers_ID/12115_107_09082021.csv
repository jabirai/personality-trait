107.0,Provider,Good morning.
12115.0,Patient,How are you.
107.0,Provider,"i'm good, how are you."
12115.0,Patient,Tired.
107.0,Provider,"So how's it been going we just kind of started the whole thing yesterday, right."
12115.0,Patient,yeah yeah so it was absolute utter chaos yesterday. I am things were not very well organized like I only got a schedule for myself the night before at 10 o'clock.
107.0,Provider,"Oh, my gosh."
12115.0,Patient,mm hmm.
107.0,Provider,thought it was crazy that you were having to get last week he didn't even get it last week.
12115.0,Patient,"Oh no. So um. yeah it was I mean I definitely made sure that I took my 10 minute break and my lunch got cut short but I didn't impact the my ability to eat lunch like it. It was so i'm supposed to get a 30 minute lunch and there was a. mix up with lunch schedules, or something not not like staff lunch schedules a children's lunch schedules, so I only ended up getting 20 Minutes yesterday, but that was fine. and While it was utter chaos, I felt like I did a good job of making sure that I took care of myself and then I was really stressed out though, when I got my schedule, because they had shifted my my work time to end at 330. and Without even talking to me about that and we've never like. I don't like we all just end when the kids and like I don't know what that was about, but so I sent an email immediately when I bought the schedule and said that. I could absolutely not shift my my schedule to do after school supervision, but that, if they needed me to fill a supervision slot I would be happy to come and do morning supervision and. And I don't know I think I tend to have. I think I tend to jump to like worst case scenario sort of thing, but she sent me back the new principal send me back an email immediately saying oh yeah we'll make that switch um so. You know, I was getting. needlessly worried about I mean. Sometimes, if you just like speak up and say say what your needs are it's pretty easy to get them accommodated rather than. Three no. not seeing anything and then like freaking out about it. yep um and then so, then I also found out yesterday did. Our school time and I had been miss printed, so we actually ended 305 and I was like oh God that's, not because I thought it was three o'clock and I was like Okay, well, I can you know get anyway um I finally actually got to meet our principal yesterday because I hadn't met her yet and. I decided that I felt comfortable enough sending her an email telling her and I didn't ask I realized that I told her I said on Mondays Tuesdays and Thursdays i'm going to need to leave school at. Which is 10 minutes early and I said I have an important pressing personal issue that i'm you know medically related that I, I cannot ignore, and I said so for those days, I will. Only take a 20 minute lunch and do supervision for that extra 10 minutes because it worked out just fine yesterday and. and You know this is temporary it's not going to go on forever and. She wrote back last night same that's fine with me or, then I said. I said, please let me know if this is acceptable, because you know, I do have to I kind of laid it out."
107.0,Provider,Later this is this is going to do here's my point. Right that's right.
12115.0,Patient,"And then she wrote back and said oh that sounds fine no problem, she said, if there's anything else, I can do to support you let me know. And I think she said she said lingering medical issues are you know are inconvenient, and I, and she came from a she she had coven this summer and cannot get rid of her cough like it just will not. go away so she knows about the lingering thing. So, and you know so. I still don't really know her at all, but i'm so far i'm i'm thumbs up on her, and I feel good that I just. went out and kind of like took that risk."
107.0,Provider,made it happen.
12115.0,Patient,So.
107.0,Provider,I love it. Especially since you got immediately rewarded with positive results that's fantastic.
12115.0,Patient,yeah.
107.0,Provider,Good.
12115.0,Patient,"So I am feeling like the pieces are falling into place more or less um I, I will say that, like. My. Labor day weekend wasn't wasn't the best like I kind of let stress kind of get to me and. and I don't feel like I tried hard enough to use coping mechanisms, I think. Part of it was because, like. i'm like On Monday I. I still have a schedule, I was feeling like just there, so you know so many changes and so much on my plate, and I spent so much of the day, like trying to redirect and everything and then. And I didn't have I didn't have a lot of stuff set up for myself to do on on Monday and I just got worn out trying to. Keep myself, you know busy and redirected and um. yeah I think that's really kind of what it boils down to but um. I decided after yesterday that I wanted not yesterday, the six whatever. That I wanted to try. And like so Sarah was saying that she was journaling every morning and setting down like her intentions for the day, so I decided that starting yesterday I was going to try doing that in Kenya and i'm so like my I wrote down at my intentions when I have it right here, see. It was about like you know, taking care of myself. I said today, I will take care of myself and I will not engage in behaviors I will use my coping mechanisms, I will be aware, and not dissociate I will not allow the stress of school to impact my self care, I will be proud of myself today and I kind of just let that carry me. Through the day so even when I no idea what I was doing at school or, where I was supposed to be, or anything like that I was just like. You know, nobody does nobody has any clue it's fine don't worry about it and i'm and I kind of like I felt like I carried that with me all day kind of. Great so i'm going to try doing that. Then. I also um. I asked Anastasia if she would be willing to be my. Like. check in buddy so yesterday I checked in with her after lunch, and I was like yes ate lunch did it Okay, and then I checked in with her at night again. And I think it was helpful just having. Like you know I didn't I didn't want to tell Anastasia at the end of the day today wasn't good you know. And so it was kind of helpful having that it's different when I have. Because you know in would definitely be willing for me to check in with him and. But it's kind of different when you're talking to somebody who really understands what you're. going through and what how hard it is to. You know. not engage in these behaviors or like it was it was kind of interesting because I was talking to Seamus over the weekend. Oh, I didn't tell my family like I told Seamus and and also that I had a difficult time over the weekend so. Okay, Seamus. Seamus actually called me to check in with me yesterday evening because I said that I had set up with somebody from group that I was going to be checking in with them, but. Seamus did send me like a message during the day and then he called me later to ask how. How things were going and I like I was like wow that's really sweet that my kid took time out of his college schedule, but. Just you know check in and he didn't talk to me anything about I mean he just said, you know how did your day go and then you know what was you know he didn't really talk about the. The game stuff or anything like that and I didn't expect him to but just that I mean he knew that."
107.0,Provider,you're having a tough time is.
12115.0,Patient,yeah.
107.0,Provider,It can it. yeah yeah.
12115.0,Patient,"So I thought that was really nice of him and. And so you know I I told my family as well you know I told Anastasia and my family, and so you know it's not like i'm. Because I certainly don't want to get a situation where i'm telling some things, some people and other things to other people that way, nobody actually knows what's going on. Because I think secrecy is the biggest. You know poison. And so. I have no idea where I was going with all this, but anyway, something about accountability, and you know Oh, I know I was because I was talking to Seamus over the weekend and. He was like I don't get it, how. You know, because he was like i'm so busy at college, I have like. he's like I want to do this, and this, and this, and this and i'm like yeah great you know just make sure you have time to study and and then he's like yeah and I have to get an on campus job because you know it's one of the. Requirements yeah and I was like I almost said to him well I can't tell you what how difficult it is to work during college and I was like wait a minute. I work 30 hours a week during college what am I talking about I was like yeah you can't you can balance it but it's tricky I said I didn't do anything really like I said, my college existence was working doing my schoolwork kind of. In a mediocre fashion and i'm trying to run also in a mediocre fashion and then having my eating disorder and that was all of my time. and he's like I don't How does eating disorders take up time like I would think that having an eating disorder would take up less time because if you're not going to eat like. How much time does that take, and I was like no shame is like it's not just like the not eating it's also like figuring out, you know if I wanted to binge and purge like when I can do that how I can do that, you know. And that that all takes time and then all the just I said, your mind get sucked into like you can't think about anything else, but like food and. Eating and all that kind of stuff and he's. I think he was he I mean he didn't really understand that, but he's like Oh, you know he kind of as. I think he kind of got that the idea, a little bit, but. i'm glad that I opened up to him, and that he feels okay asking questions like that, because while some of the questions have been you know not really comfortable. there's so far we haven't hit anything that i've been unwilling to discuss with. him and I actually share, he asked me to share my ED autobiography than I did."
107.0,Provider,Okay.
12115.0,Patient,"um and that was a little scary feeling just because you know there's a lot of rapid and. And you know when I sharing something like that. I. Like I don't think that. You know he's going to stop loving me or something, but I. I could see his like view of me demean or dark mean or you know somehow modifying like God my mom did this like us."
107.0,Provider,mm hmm.
12115.0,Patient,"You know there's always that fear of some judgment there, but we talked afterwards and. He just thanked me for sharing it with them, and he asked me. Some questions about you know eating disorders and stuff like that, and I said, you know if you ever said it's not easy for me to discuss this, but if you ever have any more questions you know do ask right."
107.0,Provider,Did you and Ian discuss it further.
12115.0,Patient,"um. well. We had a discussion prior to the 28 about it. And that was the one where he. You know the trust issue came up. And that was. But other than that we, I mean he's been out of the country, so I haven't. Really talked about I mean i've sent him updates on how i'm doing, and you know if i'm you know i've been open about struggling or not struggling and. But yeah we haven't had any like."
107.0,Provider,doesn't sound like you guys have had the opportunity to really have any talks.
12115.0,Patient,"No, not no."
107.0,Provider,Just quick check ins. yeah everyone's still alive. Okay.
12115.0,Patient,I nobody has coven.
107.0,Provider,"Okay, good yeah, these are the two questions, these days."
12115.0,Patient,"But there, they are actually they just boarded their plane so i'll be home this evening."
107.0,Provider,Good good now is he going to go back and forth for a little bit or does this other contract is he stateside her is that the contract.
12115.0,Patient,"Oh, this was actually this was not a job related at all this was he was running the okay i'm gonna get the order wrong but it doesn't matter to either of us world mountain masters running World Championships no I saw a."
107.0,Provider,lot of ways anyway.
12115.0,Patient,They were in the Austrian Alps. So four miles straight up. yeah. At altitude anyway. He took Fiona with him. And I know. I got some interesting texts about that i'll have to say he.
107.0,Provider,"wasn't good for her, I mean Maybe she needs to be in a little bit. kind of in the wilderness in those situations or."
12115.0,Patient,"Well, she did ask to be left there when he returned. But let's see."
107.0,Provider,"easier way, not in a sarcastic smart oh yeah she knows."
12115.0,Patient,She likes.
107.0,Provider,I could see where she would like it.
12115.0,Patient,"But um she did I think one of one day he in described the situation with her or the trip so far with her as grim. Apparently, she wouldn't really express any opinions about what she wanted to do, and so in would give an opinion and she would liberally criticize every opinion. He gave but she would give nothing of her own, and I just kind of like well."
107.0,Provider,Welcome to my world.
12115.0,Patient,"Exactly um, but they did have some fun days were like they went to some castles and that kind of stuff and. She they went hiking in the Alps and she made some sheep friends and he actually got a phone normally she like runs away from photographs, but he got a photograph of her smiling sitting with some sheep all around her petting them so that was you."
107.0,Provider,that's amazing.
12115.0,Patient,"So i'm hoping that it was good for her to get out and then she gets to go to school, tomorrow, which will be."
107.0,Provider,A half oh boy.
12115.0,Patient,I know.
107.0,Provider,wow. If she'll get up early.
12115.0,Patient,yeah.
107.0,Provider,So that'll help.
12115.0,Patient,"it's um. i've definitely felt. A difference in just being around the House without her here like the my anxiety just my general anxiety is sort of diminished, in fact, maybe gone."
107.0,Provider,"So this will be an interesting conversation for you and and to have having he having seen. Her in that environment is Fiona better off kind of doing something with the Peace Corps being away going out to these different kind of environments where she can kind of do her own thing. But there's a purpose and she doesn't have to engage in a lot of people I know some peace corps, I mean I don't know we're just trying to think of something that's a little bit altruistic that she wouldn't. necessarily sign yourself up for but might actually be game, for if it's somewhere else."
12115.0,Patient,"I think. yeah I mean that would be something that she could consider after high school i'm just i'm Glad though that, for you know she's just not going to be sitting in the House all the time now. Can I just open the cat my cat is going crazy. I don't let them out before it gets Nice and light, because we have coyotes and."
107.0,Provider,Oh yeah.
12115.0,Patient,And owls and other things here that will.
107.0,Provider,"yeah understandable. Well, and. How many more years does she have a high school at least two three."
12115.0,Patient,And this is her sophomore year.
107.0,Provider,"Okay, so three."
12115.0,Patient,yeah and so yeah we'll just see I mean. I think you know even in high school doesn't go very well or getting out of the House is going to have a positive.
107.0,Provider,yeah. Okay.
12115.0,Patient,"And it means that you think she'll have less than him to direct it me too. Just because her her, I mean she may come home super anxious and like wound up from having to deal with being a school, but I can easily see her venting more about things that happened at school, like I hate this teacher or. This student just amaze me a little bit."
107.0,Provider,situational kind of where she's at is the thing that annoys her.
12115.0,Patient,"yeah, and so I think. it'll get it'll just brought in her world a band so don't she probably will have less less time stuff to direct it me so."
107.0,Provider,She is kind of a very good example of rage against the machine.
12115.0,Patient,yeah.
107.0,Provider,"Okay, so it will be back and then. He has a contract that he has to take care of but is he going to be back for a little bit before you before you set up for that."
12115.0,Patient,"yeah so he'll leave again on Sunday. To go back to work, and then I believe that he's back on weekends. Okay, and. i'm not hundred percent sure you can I like because this, this is also you know it's all weather and time dependent so. yeah things change. Right um. But yeah i'm glad that he's going to be around for. A little bit. Before he heads out because I feel like I haven't seen him and."
107.0,Provider,He sounds like you guys could use some serious time to just hang out together and debrief and think about different things have been going on for a while.
12115.0,Patient,"And then yeah so and then so then he's gone for you know we can then back on the weekends, but Fiona will be here in the evenings and I realized that even like even though fiona's presence isn't always fun just her like it is helpful. To me yeah have another person around. You and if it's a mean person."
107.0,Provider,it's accountability.
12115.0,Patient,"yeah so that'll be i'm. So, in that sense, like i'm looking forward to having her around I mean i'm looking forward to seeing her again to I. I, Mr. But."
107.0,Provider,Well she's still your child you still love her even though she has big pain in the ass.
12115.0,Patient,"So. yeah and then I think starting like October 8 or ninth, I think, then, it just has a few more days but working out of our port here and then he's done so. Then coming. All the time which will be."
107.0,Provider,"A good transition yeah. Does it affect you. in a negative way at all when the light starts to wane, you know we're starting to get into that season it's getting."
12115.0,Patient,I don't think so. I don't seem to have any late or you know seasonal affective disorder or anything like that.
107.0,Provider,All right.
12115.0,Patient,I mean by like. February i'm kind of like can we get a little bit. Right and shine maybe.
107.0,Provider,"No right okay all right just did it struck me last night, it was getting lighter earlier, so now it's on my radar to ask everybody."
12115.0,Patient,yeah no i've never really struggled with that.
107.0,Provider,"So it sounds like all the big boxes have been checked off how's it going well, you haven't really even had a chance to appreciate it yet, but how's it going with the person helping you out for the cross country team."
12115.0,Patient,"Ah, well, that hasn't happened yet."
107.0,Provider,it's gonna happen tomorrow.
12115.0,Patient,"No actually i'm going to do it tomorrow, because he's."
107.0,Provider,he's here okay.
12115.0,Patient,"Or, he will be here, yes provider that i'm."
107.0,Provider,"Right, there is no. delays and everything right."
12115.0,Patient,So. So yeah he's going to do this week and then so she'll start helping me next week and we've i've met up with her a couple of times we'll talk some more about it and actually today I will be telling the team. Because.
107.0,Provider,You haven't had.
12115.0,Patient,A chance to really not really know yesterday was our first day of practice and we were we're missing a bunch of kids still be. As it was the first day and and everyone play. It was really interesting how overwhelmed the kids for. huh after a whole day of school like. You haven't been.
107.0,Provider,Rising right over here.
12115.0,Patient,"yeah and all of them had terrible runs except for one, so you know they were all exhausted and just like oh sorry guys. So yeah yesterday was not the right day to tell them so i'll be telling them today and i'm actually like I was so nervous about it, but now, now that i've like have that positive experience with my principal and everything like. yeah I feel like the pieces are the."
107.0,Provider,Face it's fine yeah the.
12115.0,Patient,Work you know. yeah. I mean i'm not excited to tell them night um.
107.0,Provider,"But it's coming together, it feels like you're going to have enough support to kind of get through it."
12115.0,Patient,So.
107.0,Provider,"So do you think that maybe you need to kind of change the schedule and your coaching a little bit just in terms of the training, because of the kids being so kind of befuddled or just let them work through it and see how it plays out."
12115.0,Patient,yeah well today we're just doing very they're doing very.
107.0,Provider,Okay.
12115.0,Patient,So yeah i'm just going to kind of.
107.0,Provider,"i'm going to let them as it's a. thing right, I mean it makes sense that that would fit. You know it's going to take a toll on them."
12115.0,Patient,yeah so I i'm just gonna kind of let them go as they feel today i'm intuitive running.
107.0,Provider,"Okay, good. So I wonder if, in this experience I don't know why my dog is having these needs yeah there you go. I i'm wondering it's in your own experience of wellness and and learning about how self care on a different level now, if you will have maybe some adjustments in your training and the things that you share in terms of giving your kids awareness about. You know their own training and and how they're doing. If you're. going to have not this you're not mental health expert, but I mean maybe have. more of a bent to it, though."
12115.0,Patient,But I think we may have to have a. i'm not sure how to pull this off about like a red ass education session. readiness oh sorry um it's relative energy deficiency in sport it's the new term instead of eating disorder. I. think they are feeling like. it'll catch more boys and. it's also doesn't seem stigmatizing.
107.0,Provider,"But it to me again i'm sorry I did this is that's very fascinating to me and I have. This, like my first time which is kind of sad and shocking to me that i've not heard this before that's okay. i'm here to be educated. Read s."
12115.0,Patient,it's an I put it in the chat. Nice so it's relative energy deficiency syndrome in sport.
107.0,Provider,In sport so it's specific to being able to. Actually.
12115.0,Patient,"athlete yeah um and but it's all about how you know getting appropriate nutrition to fuel your body needs and your athletic needs and i'm there's a girl on my team who's really worrying me and i've never had this happen on the team before um. But. You know I don't feel like I can just let it, you know I can't ignore it obviously. But i'm really not sure what steps to take um."
107.0,Provider,"Well, I think you know you're kind of in the learn one do one teach one opportunity. you're learning for your own stuff not that you need to get into it from your perspective, but you know. We do actually encourage teaching in our own programs, so this is an opportunity to even just. Look, something up and educate from the perspective of let's just talk about what this is and what this means, and why this came up and. And how important it is to acknowledge and understand this and know the signs, so that we can support and help each other and somebody struggling with this, how do you how do you start to work through that and and then. If you feel comfortable, you can say I can get where it would feel really scary to talk about this because, maybe you don't really want to make any changes you don't want to feel bad, but at the same time there's some comfort that comes with this maybe and you're afraid to let that go. And then you can kind of speak to it from that perspective and then. Maybe reach out to. I don't know the school nurse or the school counselor and see what kind of resources that district has in terms of education."
12115.0,Patient,"Think very, very."
107.0,Provider,"I was just gonna say it's probably you, you probably have the strongest amount of information just from your own experience, not that I want you to share that but."
12115.0,Patient,"No, I I thought, maybe we could just do like a I could do like a team presentation on read s as a start, and I was, I was thinking about approaching her directly from a place of compassion and using I statements like i've noticed. And you know and so nothing not like you're not eating enough or anything accusatory because I. I actually messaged Sarah about this too, because you know we're both high school and collegiate athletes, and so I asked her How would she wanted to have been approached if she was in that position, like and and you know i'm not 100% sure that this girl has a problem. She could just be growing but I don't think so, I mean she's cold all the time she has to like. Like we were doing a team thing I had to put a blanket down because your bones on the ground we're hurting too much, you know that kind of thing um. So anyway, I and, but I also don't want to just assume Oh, maybe it's because she's growing let's just ignore it."
107.0,Provider,"But anyway, oh yeah."
12115.0,Patient,yeah I talked to Sarah so i'm just kind of like you know I thought oh that'd be a good good brand.
107.0,Provider,It sounded work.
12115.0,Patient,"So i'm just trying to put the pieces together to figure out how to how to do that because it's also you know it's not i'm not devoid of emotion going into this, you know."
107.0,Provider,Right. Good.
12115.0,Patient,loaded topic.
107.0,Provider,It is loaded tough.
12115.0,Patient,"at it, but it also makes me wonder like. How I would have wanted to be approached when I was a high school athlete. No lady or I wish somebody had approached me as a high school athlete I mean I don't know if it would have made any difference, but you know it might have."
107.0,Provider,"well. yeah it's not likely that it would have all of a sudden, you would have been like Oh, my goodness, and change behavior but each time we bring awareness to something it becomes more difficult to deny it. So you have to be really burrowed into the denial behavior you have to be really determined to ignore it, and that makes life uncomfortable too so. Either way, it's a good idea to just encourage the agitation, because the agitation stems from some level of awareness accountability, you know i'm each time you engage in a behavior then you're not doing it just blindly, and all of that factors in. Everything okay and you're a rude. typical of a fire agenda or a siren to go cruising yeah That was a."
12115.0,Patient,Police car.
107.0,Provider,huh. So yeah interesting how life is coming together.
12115.0,Patient,"yeah. i've been I noticed that. i've been feeling just grateful for a lot of. A lot more things lately like being just able to appreciate. Like even in even in a stressful Day yesterday, like, I was really grateful that you know it was sunny out like just like little things were just."
107.0,Provider,yeah.
12115.0,Patient,"You know, things that I could are."
107.0,Provider,noticing stuff. yeah good. So it sounds like this week is about just continuing to acclimate and settle and find. Over and find the rhythm.
12115.0,Patient,"yeah and like yeah I also like I made sure yesterday when school for the start of school I also brought down like a bag of. Like just some frozen like burrito things and smoothies and just things that I labeled and stuck in the fridge and you know, just in case like it's I feel like. You know I don't want to get in a situation where I don't have like a snack or you know, so I just I feel like I. i'm all i'm finding ways, where I can't end up in the same patterns and I, and I know that was kind of one of my fears was like Okay, going back to school like i've done xyz at school for so long, and you know that was. You know, so my fear was kind of like oh go back to school same."
107.0,Provider,thing back to the header.
12115.0,Patient,"yeah but um, I think, for the first time in two years, I packed a totally different lunch like I always used to just bring a bagel sandwich. And I didn't pack a bagel so I packed like a bunch of different stuff and. Just you know I lunch, I saw john and just ate it and. And it was like. I think, maybe just packing different stuff and then you know just following through with like this is different, everything is different now."
107.0,Provider,yeah I like them.
12115.0,Patient,made it made it different.
107.0,Provider,"I like it. So it's a little bit more work because it breaks you out of the routine even further, even though you haven't been in this particular routine to your point it's so easy to slip back into it, because Well, this is what I do when I was school. Right so really making the conscious effort to behave differently into. do things differently you'll have to probably make this effort for the next three weeks. Oh, it becomes well i'm just saying until it becomes less cumbersome to make the effort, but it will take about three weeks to really kind of not feel quite so arduous in the task."
12115.0,Patient,"And I actually don't expect to have a regular schedule for at least the next couple of weeks because it turns out there's too many eighth grade students, we have. We have 34 kids per classroom yesterday we do many, and I mean that's to me, even without code and i'm so they're having to make another class which means everyone's schedules going to get rearranged several more times in the next couple weeks, most likely. wow, but I am just whatever i'm gonna roll with it, I aren't even going to pretend like I know what my because that's that's when I get into like stress is when i'm like oh I bet i'm going to be doing this and then. What totally different than what I think and then i'm."
107.0,Provider,yeah yeah never better not trying to figure it out that's somebody else's job.
12115.0,Patient,"And then, what and since I established that i'm leaving five minutes early Tuesday or Monday, Tuesday and Thursday. yeah or I mean 10 minutes early I I don't care like that's The important thing i've."
107.0,Provider,gotten figure it out.
12115.0,Patient,"yeah well, I mean Okay, and my brakes, but on the new principal seems very concerned about people getting breaks when they need, you know getting their own 10 minutes."
107.0,Provider,sounds like you got a health conscious human on your hands that's fantastic.
12115.0,Patient,"yeah i'm so. You know, as long as I get my lunch break and a chance to use the bathroom and eat a snack and can leave 10 minutes early on those three days I don't care what happens well okay I care something, but you know I can deal with the rest of it."
107.0,Provider,"I like. i'm making note of the. bread so because I don't want to forget about that I want to look that up and make sure the team has done. Well, this is good, it feels like it's kind of been a very. embrace the transitions state of things and a lot of things would come together as a result of that."
12115.0,Patient,"yeah and I um. I noticed that, like. While yes, I did how kind of a. kiki stress day on Monday. Like I have handled this all much better than I ever have in the past in terms of like taking care of myself during it and not just. Totally freaking out like I mean I remember last year when not knowing schedules and stuff like just I could I could feel the tension like just kind of coming in and me, it was just like yeah not good. But I can only like I keep telling myself, I can only control what I can control and I certainly can't control any of the school schedules so like that I can control that I, you know eat my lunch yeah and."
107.0,Provider,How you take care of yourself.
12115.0,Patient,"Exactly, so I just kind of keep repeating that."
107.0,Provider,yep yep. Definitely sounds like there's some interesting stuff going on in your neighborhood.
12115.0,Patient,"yeah i'm not sure what's going on August, but um yeah it's kind of a exciting morning."
107.0,Provider,"So how are you doing in terms of behaviors have you been able to keep things down to a dull roar in terms of purging and all that are you able to stay kind of it, the numbers you're hoping to be up."
12115.0,Patient,"I would say I probably haven't like I haven't kept a tally like a weekly I mean I have it written down, but I haven't added about for anything at all, do you have a Thursday but. I think this week is going to be a bit of an uptick. Just because the like Sunday and Monday we're. Definitely days of struggle, but like yesterday was good today my intention is good. And I today it's it's actually very important to me today that I engage in no behaviors because that is my birthday present to myself for today so."
107.0,Provider,I needed something else. To talk about all right well happy birthday.
12115.0,Patient,"that's very exciting yeah so and I figured, that is the best present I can. Get myself."
107.0,Provider,I love that absolutely.
12115.0,Patient,"So um. And you know yesterday was definitely not a day you know, not without stress, I mean it was busy but. I certainly had the opportunity in the you know once I got home. To venture merge, and I did not so i'm. i'm hoping that, like. No i'm not hoping, I am using. You know the weekend. To you know learn from that and it was really hard for me to do you know share to that you know not keep it a secret I was it you who was talking about the 24 hour somebody who's talking about 24 hour rule last week, I wrote that down somewhere. Okay, and so I was oh. No, no, it was on Sep tember second that doesn't mean anything, though i'm."
107.0,Provider,Thursday group.
12115.0,Patient,"Okay, and so I was like yeah I think that's something like you know I need to adhere to that because. Otherwise, you know if you keep it a secret and wait, then it should yeah. So um. But I really feel like. I feel like now i'm on more on top of things like I feel like I can manage it and i've been thinking about. Like what what coping strategies are probably best for the school environment um obviously distractions a good one because you know there's a million things going on and and then I can do, but just like. I think it's going to be a good place to practice acceptance because there's not I mean. I can't do a behaviorist I mean, I cannot eat at school, but I cannot bend jumpers. will obviously um. So I think just kind of like sitting with it and acceptance, I think, because I used to just not known for everything, so I think again awareness and then acceptance, are going to be I think it'll be a good opportunity to practice that's."
107.0,Provider,Good. I like it. For lots of practice this coming week.
12115.0,Patient,And then next week next week.
107.0,Provider,"So um any special birthday plans for maybe this weekend, since herbaceous getting back tonight or."
12115.0,Patient,"i'm going to a cross country meet this weekend. boy actually it is, it is a really, really fun for us it's probably one of the most fun ones we go to the it's a relay or boys and girls are you know, have to pass off to each other and they actually have to run through a part of a lake so it's pretty funny to watch that. But I know I mean, I have a friend who's bringing me some tiramisu tonight, which i'm very excited about because that's one of. My favorite desserts. Nice um. But I don't know that I mean I don't really feel like I need to do anything. You know hugely celebratory my husband wish me happy birthday, this morning, which was. Nice because he remembered. And so yeah I don't I don't feel like I need a lot for it, but just the fact that no he recognized it that's that's good. will probably my daughter might decide to make a cake, or something like I don't know we'll see. She does like baking, and so this would be an excuse for her to bake something."
107.0,Provider,"Okay, all right."
12115.0,Patient,If she has time.
107.0,Provider,"Right yeah. Interesting interesting to see how she makes this adjustment goes right into school I could be really good for her maybe. yeah. So for next week, should we try and meet again at 630 just because it is what it is, or what are your thoughts."
12115.0,Patient,"I think that's probably best for now, especially since I don't have any clue what my schedule is going to be and I do know, though, that 630 will work because there's no way i'm coming you know there's no way I would be at school earlier than. So yeah. And I have to say it was really weird knowing that I was missing group yesterday."
107.0,Provider,well. that's a good sign. yeah used to your routine so feel strange to not be in it.
12115.0,Patient,But then Anastasia told me that they had to write a love letter to themselves and read it out loud sounds like that was a good balance and in this.
107.0,Provider,Maybe you should do it anyway.
