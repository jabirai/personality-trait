14110.0,Patient,Oh sorry yes. There we go.
740.0,Provider,Good deal so how's everything been going.
14110.0,Patient,i'm like decently i've been. Trying to deal with the medication stuff again. And currently i'm just waiting for it to percolate through the pharmacy so they say they've gotten it so they just have to put it together for me.
740.0,Provider,"Okay, so when you are with the transition with the process is a little smoother this time than last time, or you kind of lesson okay."
14110.0,Patient,Go ahead and I had to go and pay for it nurse visit. hmm everything else little bit kind of like okay well.
740.0,Provider,"The the missionary ever call you because i'd be take. A Dave messaged her after this session that we had. She said that she tried she says you tried after the session we had I had mentioned her about the frustrations, you had in regards to the process and I started to reach out to you to kind of let you know which is."
14110.0,Patient,The chicken and I did. And I haven't seen it so all together possible so.
740.0,Provider,"He tried to reach out to fs and have a message, and I think she didn't get an answer. But. let her know like I said, if you had if you ever have any issues or anything like that, with that process to medication. yeah let her know immediately I like I say once we've got all. Actually, while I was on the session ID misses her and let her know that your process is very, very tedious."
14110.0,Patient,yeah.
740.0,Provider,Other than that.
14110.0,Patient,"I mean I kind of felt like I was being punished for having forgotten that. forgotten that it was, Wednesday, at one day so."
740.0,Provider,yeah.
14110.0,Patient,"So I had to jump through extra hoops it's like Okay, this is the first time I forgotten an appointment and it's already like this oh that's great. And it's like I know the whole showing up for stuff is important, but I legitimately forgot that the day was Wednesday and there was nothing I can do, from that point."
740.0,Provider,"yeah. Well, hopefully we can hopefully something can get regulated to where you don't have to keep going through the hassle of getting your medication feel."
14110.0,Patient,"yeah because it has been two weeks in a row and it's like yes, I know, it would have been better if I been able to just go to the group group session but I wasn't able to do that so."
740.0,Provider,How often do you need me sharing them oh.
14110.0,Patient,I only ever see her during group meetings.
740.0,Provider,I haven't so you never met with her one on one.
14110.0,Patient,"I did the first time there was just the one thing and then it's like, no one has proffered that as a possibility, so I guess I could go ahead and. Pride make an appointment specifically."
740.0,Provider,Where. yeah you can schedule with her at any time.
14110.0,Patient,yeah it was just like the last time that we were in session together if session when law and therefore big. didn't wind up doing personal stuff so the phone like we usually are like like when see normally the routine.
740.0,Provider,So what's the status of everything now.
14110.0,Patient,i'm just waiting for us i'm just waiting for writing to get back to me on tool on when they've got it ready for me.
740.0,Provider,"So well basically me going through this process you just said, Wednesday."
14110.0,Patient,Oh yeah. that's okay I kind of just like well that's what i'm going to have to deal with them.
740.0,Provider,"Well, this is what I will say just schedule a one on one with Sharon and let her know so that she can because the last time I missed a message to her. about that and I talked to her about what was going on, she took responsibility for because she's in charge of the refill. So. So it's like."
14110.0,Patient,Sometimes I just need to go and.
740.0,Provider,"Sometimes, what. Were you think i'm."
14110.0,Patient,Just I. just have to do stuff sometimes and.
740.0,Provider,Like know.
14110.0,Patient,How I feel about it.
740.0,Provider,"But I mean yeah i'm saying that you will have to do things sometime However, I think it will be, since you don't really stay after group to talk to her."
14110.0,Patient,"Then, maybe it'd be better. For lack of trying you."
740.0,Provider,"know I know that I know she get swamped and all that kind of stuff to be efficient, blah blah. But maybe it would be beneficial, just to have a one on one so either you can schedule it with her or I can reach out to her for her to schedule one with you. Even if we don't get this resolved."
14110.0,Patient,it's all right i'll just go ahead and do it.
740.0,Provider,"No, you guys who actually if you go to schedule one with her on the retest the hard to schedule which is which I wanted. I got my phone i'm already messaging which we want to do."
14110.0,Patient,Oh boy my whole not ever wanting to bother people shtick is really getting in my getting in my way for things. Now i'll go ahead and make an appointment with her.
740.0,Provider,i'm gonna let her know that you're going to make an appointment with her so she can be looking forward so that means you got to do it. Because she's gonna be looking forward.
14110.0,Patient,I believe me it's yes do it for other people.
740.0,Provider,"and hopefully that'll be able to assist with the meditation. Because of course I don't want you to have to go through the hassle every time you need to refill or every time you need something middle medication, because I know how problematic that can be tested, considering that you don't like hounding people or feeling like you're bothering people."
14110.0,Patient,Like something.
740.0,Provider,To get something accomplished.
14110.0,Patient,"it's also not. It don't feel like it's something that I should be having to do this necessarily for when i've been on this medication for. A while already it's one thing if, like we were trying new stuff but we aren't doing that, right now, so it should just be a kind of standard thing but it's not happening like that so."
740.0,Provider,"Well, like, I said that the I believe that communication is key, and so. i'm going to continue to communicate and to. Hopefully, get resolved, other than then how's everything else going."
14110.0,Patient,"Mostly more of the same it's like a lot of stuff doesn't change much for me, so a week to week basis so. I, the only thing i've done that is quote new was like when installed blenders so I could start trying to do animation shit because that seems to be one of the only things it's like yeah I can at least play with this, and maybe make. Out of it later."
740.0,Provider,"that's good. that's good. that's a plus. The fact that you've got something new at all is a plus. Well that's good, at least at least you're willing to try something new and wanting to play around and see what what can come out of it so that's a plus."
14110.0,Patient,No yeah I just I don't really expect there to be anything that comes out of it it's like.
740.0,Provider,"You don't have to expect it, but the fact that you're willing to do it that's all the matters, let the rest of a surprise you, if something comes out of it yea if it doesn't if the end of the day is do something productive for you to do."
14110.0,Patient,"Well, given a certain definition of productive."
740.0,Provider,what's the definition. of passion about him.
14110.0,Patient,"Well it's like i'm not working on any projects i'm not actually producing anything so yeah kind of. not really productive so it's only productive in the sense, there is a slight change in behavior and even then that's not really much because it's literally just me using another computer program so."
740.0,Provider,"Well, I was just talking about productive in regards to actually doing something to keep yourself busy versus. being stuck in your thoughts or in. yeah basically being stuck in your thoughts."
14110.0,Patient,"it's like yeah my other video games to do that too, but yeah."
740.0,Provider,So what has been happening. what's been the struggle lately. Besides the medicine.
14110.0,Patient,i'm missing my cat.
740.0,Provider,OK OK OK where's the. time you thought about getting another one.
14110.0,Patient,"or foster it you currently for kittens that we caught. In our own backyard set we're trying to find homes for them. cuz there for them and that's like we really shouldn't do for low. Right yeah but issue with liking, to take in way too many pets so."
740.0,Provider,"what's The good thing about what, why do you like it."
14110.0,Patient,"I mean it's the whole it's the. Oh, what is it what's the term. it's literally the competitive aspect that's the whole point of having cats, in my opinion, at least. And since we don't really live on a farm or anything there's not a functional use for them necessarily other than maybe you know rats and mice not liking, the smell of cat so."
740.0,Provider,they're.
14110.0,Patient,"really not liking to hang out in those areas so there's that. um. it's you know just cats make sense to be generally but 72 dogs, a lot of a lot of the animals, make a great deal more sense to me than people do. Say oh."
740.0,Provider,"We can understand. They communicate, but they communicate in different ways."
14110.0,Patient,"as well, yes, and with humans you're never sure if the message you're trying to give is the one that's actually going to get across. Animals are somewhat more consistent with that."
740.0,Provider,I think you told me was that was. That the cat that you made was that the cat their past.
14110.0,Patient,Right yeah yeah.
740.0,Provider,I mean.
14110.0,Patient,"Our whole family is actually just neglecting. Is the problem and it's just it's pretty much exactly the how I got as bad as I got. Because of this exact same behavior so. it's like yeah I did that to him to, but if it's like yeah it sucks. Because we were absolutely responsible for that getting as bad as."
740.0,Provider,You take blame for that.
14110.0,Patient,"Oh it's. I know I could have done more. But I know that I was not the appropriate psychometric statement do so i'm hoping. Because my mother had just retired and she somehow managed to be more busy than ever. During that time frame and my followers he just didn't do any hey. It was just awful because it just felt like we were just waiting for. Something that's like we knew that there was something seriously wrong but we didn't really do anything about it because it's difficult so she has story of my life so. God forbid, you actual people actually do something. and part of the problem was that I had already fought for last cat that we had gone and had to put down. To go and. Because they didn't do anything for either. My family has a thing or reload to ignore problems until they go away."
740.0,Provider,"Because they don't go away. Well, you weren't."
14110.0,Patient,that's go away.
740.0,Provider,But the problem. It doesn't go away the cast go.
14110.0,Patient,It doesn't go away yeah. i'm not. convinced.
740.0,Provider,"mm. hmm. Quite agree, I mean I animals are part of our family."
14110.0,Patient,"Oh, believe me, I know that part i'm just increase, no one else in my family will acknowledge that we did to have it set. up. Because nobody actually wants to address the underlying issue. So it just doesn't get dealt with all the way."
740.0,Provider,yeah. it's basically bringing the feeling that you've basically been experiencing your whole life.
14110.0,Patient,"it's pretty much that it's like No, this is what I got to be I would have been such an awful place before why wouldn't have trying to kill myself but it's like it's the second goddamn problem. And while it's just it well, it is made up of suffering I didn't care so much it's like no we did it to our cat who is our like. He is a he was a dependent he had no choice. But again that's just how my family has always quote dealt with thing this was by not dealing with someone and tell it or they went away or they became such a catastrophic problem that we had to deal with. Like no we didn't really end up taking him into the vet until he had a huge open access essentially that. So. And I was the one who noticed it, I was the first person because they haven't go well that's that's it. i'm just tired of having a fight with them constantly about other it's just."
740.0,Provider,What do you find within about constantly.
14110.0,Patient,"Oh no it just the whole it's like, why are we not, why are we just. letting the shit happen. But they don't ever want to address it, so therefore we just don't."
740.0,Provider,"You know, one of the thing one one thing I learned about parents is that a lot of times and they they they carry over what they learned as children. And how they were brought up."
14110.0,Patient,"yeah. Oh, believe me, I understand exactly how we got to this situation. doesn't change the fact that it never should have gone this far. It never resulted in me trying to kill myself and never should have resulted in the cat dying. But that was because my family loves to ignore problems that's what happened so. Talk about massive elephants in the room, all the time."
740.0,Provider,You have a lot of resentment.
14110.0,Patient,"Well, I didn't do because these blame others, done a excellent job trying to like. change how she interacts with me and she supported my recovery a great feel. doesn't change the fact that. Much at this neglect does everything else. And i'm but i'm Okay, with my mom because she's actually made an effort. On trying to at least fix stuff with me, my father has not and continues not too so. And he just gets extremely upset whenever anyone tries to bring up anything so it's like great. instance intends to none of us want to deal with that, when he said he just he just don't bother him with anything. And he just doesn't seem to recognize it says own part and. guess there was one specific place I got my whole avoidant personality from and it's mostly him because he does avoids anything he finds one comfortable."
740.0,Provider,"My question. Because. Just because your parents are who they are. and raise you to be who you are right now yep. doesn't mean that you have to say, the way you are."
14110.0,Patient,"here. And i'm just press I guess i'm frustrated because i've managed to pull myself further out. But helpful would be created. Even though i'm. Like what is it a third of their age. it's like yeah okay fine, I guess, I just have to do it myself. But I can't support myself right now so."
740.0,Provider,"I mean you can support yourself by now financially, but you can you definitely can support yourself emotionally and mentally and then that they're plays a major role in the progression in your progression."
14110.0,Patient,"yeah. Believe me, i've already done a lot on that front, I don't hate myself the way that I used to when I don't. hate myself for all the stuff I wasn't able to do and so. Like I still feel. I still feel guilty about it, but I know it's not really my fault. it's a product of circumstance moral. It says again more about. What kind of awful state of mind i've been in rather that you know. My. moral compass as a human so. It still doesn't make it any less bad."
740.0,Provider,Right yeah. So one of the phrases that I heard you say. The thing with this is the story of my life. And in my mind when you said that out okay well how do we change this story. How do we change the story of your life.
14110.0,Patient,pretty much out of here and I keep doing that so.
740.0,Provider,"Basically, you can't progress until you leave your parents house."
14110.0,Patient,"Well, it would certainly help fight it and I have to deal with all that bullshit all the time and. it's like you know the opening and closing and slamming doors which still happens frequently is it throws me for fucking Luke and put me right back into a fight or flight mode. And it's like well that that has the medication and stuff to help buffer for me, but. I still get that knee jerk reaction. So even if there are times, where I feel like doing things it takes very, very little to take me out of that of that mode of being capable of doing something. Sorry."
740.0,Provider,"The environment and just really, really toxic."
14110.0,Patient,always has been. And no one would acknowledge the fact that it was glad my sister secrets to escape to the worst of it so.
740.0,Provider,Can you say she went to college right.
14110.0,Patient,yeah she's doing her master's and it's going. Oh.
740.0,Provider,"Have you ever considered furthering your education, so that you can get out."
14110.0,Patient,"That was part of my problem, though that was part it's like that was why I tried to commit suicide was because I failed to go and get into. I failed to go and get all the criteria done so I go to the College, that I was supposed to go to."
740.0,Provider,So there was a thing. yeah What about now and we ever thought about trying to reapply and see if you can go for it again.
14110.0,Patient,"thing is, I still don't think that I could actually pull it off so. I don't have discipline to do stuff at home when I need to do stuff at home. And I don't necessarily have the discipline to take myself to other places, to make sure I can get my homework and shift that that's always been a chronic issue with me is that. it's like yes that's my teacher is what always complain it's like it's not an issue of whether or not I understand the material it's just an issue of whether or not I do the goddamn homework or not. Just sometimes it's like yeah it just. More or less I don't think i've changed enough on a fundamental level in order to make that work so."
740.0,Provider,What do you mean What do you mean change over the phone minimum.
14110.0,Patient,"Well, I am not to the point where I could readily apply myself to one thing consistently and not just have to back out at some quote random interval because my issues are acting up again either physical or mental it's like."
740.0,Provider,"Well, basically you just need to basically use the discipline."
14110.0,Patient,"I say, mostly the discipline issue but. part is the part of the discipline stuff is I just don't think it's like I have trained myself to not care about things, because that was the only way to kind of just. and not be bought or be bothered as little as possible but what's going on, was just like well I don't care it doesn't matter."
740.0,Provider,What do you tell me what you do campaign.
14110.0,Patient,I certainly don't care about my own success so it's like it just bothers me that I can't do anything.
740.0,Provider,But then what you do care about.
14110.0,Patient,"well. What kind of response, are you looking for it because that's like."
740.0,Provider,"asking what do you care about. So you say he doesn't you don't care about your your thing Okay, but what do you care about."
14110.0,Patient,"thing is it's like even the stuff I do care about is not enough to get me to do shit after all. And yet, even though I did it was nowhere it wasn't good enough to. For me, to actually knuckle down and do more so."
740.0,Provider,Let me ask this. What are what are some goals that you want to reach. Like relief to go. This you want to reach.
14110.0,Patient,"out what's realistic and what needs to happen. Like I need to figure out a way to support myself, so I can go do I can be out of here, but I don't know how."
740.0,Provider,You say you don't want.
14110.0,Patient,I don't know how to make that happen so.
740.0,Provider,"Well, the main reason. Why. Is look you you cut your legs right from under you before you even saw walking. So, like you could have this potential."
14110.0,Patient,reason to believe otherwise.
740.0,Provider,"I understand what you're saying and we're right back to what I said, the last time we spoke. The thing about it is is they. You know the thing is, is that you discouraged yourself before. You even put one foot in front of the other. or even try to make an attempt, because you've already discouraged yourself, not to do it like you said I don't care that i'm successful well if you don't care just accessible, how are you going to ever move out. How you're going to mean that."
14110.0,Patient,that's.
740.0,Provider,"So what that means is that means you have to change your mindset that's what that mean that means you have to change the way you think and the way you see it. that's what they're made because you don't you're upset because of the fact that you want to be able to get out of something that's so toxic. But then, at the same time you have discouraged just have so much power thinking that you're not going to count amount say anything to be able to get out. You got to change the way you think."
14110.0,Patient,About melted anything it's being able to like provide enough for myself to go and be not.
740.0,Provider,"The thing, but you see the change what you think to even be able to provide enough for us to be you know. Even if you apply for a job and another thing. And another State where the where where the cost of living wasn't a much, and you can afford to live there. You would literally, even if you got the job. Would you take it. Or would you find some reason to give you the getting your own way."
14110.0,Patient,"It was a job, I thought I could do, then sure."
740.0,Provider,"So what kind of jobs, you feel like you can do."
14110.0,Patient,Like either i'm not physically or mentally capable of doing most shit.
740.0,Provider,"of job, do you think you can do."
14110.0,Patient,i've never been able to come up with what that what that can do was.
740.0,Provider,"Well, you say you work you do things animations and stuff on the computer."
14110.0,Patient,"Well it's like i'm I play with it. And, as it is it's like even then, I still have to stop sometimes because my arms get stupid. Like my right home that's been bothering me lately because i've been doing a lot more stuff at work. able to help so. can't get psychologically better until my fucking hands could work again and I oh. So far, I did not see anything that's going to actually help me get there, so. cuz yeah human beings hands are kind of important."
740.0,Provider,"yeah. But I know people who don't have any names and then I still successful. I know somebody who hand is inoperable from the shoulder all the way down to the point to where they can't even move when they move with the other hand, and they're successful. It is about nine days."
14110.0,Patient,or people than I am.
740.0,Provider,What is that.
14110.0,Patient,"No, I just said it's good for them, because they're but they're stronger people than I am i'm not you."
740.0,Provider,"don't you don't know what they are. You know you want, no, no."
14110.0,Patient,physical injuries or detriment like that does take a certain number of characters so yeah. The very least curves for that.
740.0,Provider,"Some people just the thing about it is, is that it's all about the way you think and it's about your mindset they're just they're just what it boils down to. And that's just period I mean it without your mind and without your thoughts that you can't do anything if you think if you think negatively and you'll be negative, if you think failure, then you'll be then you'll be a failure if you if you think. If you think. What is it unsuccessful but you'll be unsuccessful is a bath away you fail so as a may I think so, I think, so therefore what you think that's what you become if Alabama."
14110.0,Patient,it's like when I can't perform then it's like yeah it kind of gets in the way of.
740.0,Provider,"It but but see you have a literally. You said that I can't perform but see my thing is, I see you can't perform doing what. You have to be able to identify the things you can't before me, and so that you can at least attempt to practice those things that you haven't tried to then maybe you can perform better, and you know, not one, so you keep trying, you know what you did it."
14110.0,Patient,"Well, I it's like. it's like. it's like yes like good at something is but they aren't exactly marketable skills."
740.0,Provider,"So, what are you good, what are you good at."
14110.0,Patient,Not even that good at this but it's like. What.
740.0,Provider,don't don't don't give me this stuff I want to know what you're good at. What are you good at.
14110.0,Patient,Like yes it's like answer video games does that count and.
740.0,Provider,"Yet, people do you know how many people made Downs available just playing a video game."
14110.0,Patient,Saying oh I follow a whole bunch of them. See but. make that kind of shit work you have to be interesting enough for people don't want to watch you play.
740.0,Provider,"Then true i've watched video game didn't even have no sound on. They just played the game, just to show me how to get through it, I played a video game, to the point where I didn't know how to get to a third level I got on YouTube found the person who played the game they didn't even talk. They just play the game."
14110.0,Patient,yeah and the those doing walkthrough is also isn't particularly like a money making thing it's usually what you're doing the streaming and the other stuff. Currently it's.
740.0,Provider,"Not so much. Death match Ruiz Okay, the one in a while, because, even with the person that i'd be a little thing when I let me see I say anything on YouTube monetizes this person, a walkthrough got 3.1. site so. This walkthrough got 3.1 million views, do you don't have much money they pay people who have 3.1 million views. alive. and They are they have 75 point 3000 subscribers just to do walk through and they don't tell. And they give monetize for that. i'm just saying that is not true. You have to talk all the time. Sometimes people just one know how to get to a game they got to hear your voice to get to know game. So that's something that you're good at, you can make money off of it well, you can make money off of anything."
14110.0,Patient,that's markets is not easy.
740.0,Provider,YouTube I do is create a YouTube okay.
14110.0,Patient,getting people to actually see it is near impossible. How you're starting out it's.
740.0,Provider,"Everybody has everybody has a thought I was we were okay Linda nobody come out then on, by default, with 75 pounds. trap everybody has fun, I was evil. It is about getting funny. let's see what else, are you good at, so we got games, what else."
14110.0,Patient,"Like I do the art stuff that I not that great and the artists necessarily. But it's like I can draw. And i've enjoyed it in the past but. Like I used to be a decent rock climber, but."
740.0,Provider,yeah.
14110.0,Patient,A decent worth animals but that's really not.
740.0,Provider,it's really not worth that's a job. job and a lot of areas. Animal big cleaning lose.
14110.0,Patient,"me for a while I was keeping but you can't do those things when you can't reliably use your head. it's too important to be able to consistent be consistent with. So it's one of the main things about dealing with animals, you have to be consistent."
740.0,Provider,"and well, if you want to get work on your hand see if you can make a an appointment with the orthopedic doctor. and save you can get some assistance with your hand. You say your free time."
14110.0,Patient,To the doctor about the.
740.0,Provider,"To the orthopedic doctor, not your primary care physician your orthopedic doctor I don't have. One so. you're like on. A hold on one second your primary care physician can give you a referral to orthopedic specialist so that you can feel orthopedic doctor you're not going to have an orthopedic doctor, you have to get a referral to your primary care physician. saying a regular doctor, they will know what to do with your hand they don't know what to do with your hand i've had surgery on my wrist before i've had problems with this risk. And the thing about it is, is that, when I was my primary care physician about my hands or whatever like that, because of the fact that I had inflammation in my wrist which affected the mobility of my hand. Then they can do anything about it, but they referred me to an orthopedic doctor and when I went so orthopedic doctor, then they were able to assist me with my hand. And then I let me know, it was the inflammation of my wrist and so once I got my surgery on my wrist I haven't had no issues with my wrist at all. I haven't had no numbness in my hand at all since that time, and so all i'm telling you is maybe you can go to your PCP who have your primary care physician he tell them that you've been having trouble with your hand and you would like to be referred to orthopedic specialist."
14110.0,Patient,didn't happen the other two times I tried.

740.0,Provider,"But, did you try with the orthopedic that's what i'm saying, have you ever been to orthopedic doctor."
14110.0,Patient,i've never even been referred to one.
740.0,Provider,"Despite though that's. What i'm. that's what i'm saying. You have to. Add them to refer you. that's just how it goes they're not going to refer you to orthopedic doctor you call them you let them know hey i've been having issues with my hand, I would like to be referred to orthopedic specialist that's all you got to say."
14110.0,Patient,Well it's like not something that you know inherently.
740.0,Provider,"i'm telling you i'm telling you. i'm telling you i'm telling you this right now, so that you can do moving forward i'm not i'm not digging in the past and what didn't work back then i'll i'm telling you is that now moving forward and you."
14110.0,Patient,"going on, they could maybe send you to someone else but they never really did that they've sent you to physical therapy instead."
740.0,Provider,"I understand what they be a bad thing i'm telling you what to do now it's up to you either you can do it, or you don't but i'm telling you, you have to make the request to be able to be. referred to orthopedic stresses is your decision, but that's what you have to do. and hopefully that'll be able to resolve the issue with your hand."
14110.0,Patient,"Like Kelly, it seems like the issue with my hands a little to do with my bones it's my nerves are all fucked up."
740.0,Provider,"understand it, and they can resolve all those things, usually to go through what the PT docs. This edition is up to you."
14110.0,Patient,"Well, it means I have to go and do all sorts of or to get my dish that's great."
740.0,Provider,Like I said is up to you.
14110.0,Patient,To make it. Do something.
740.0,Provider,"yeah you do so i'm telling you what to do either you want to do it, or you don't but that's how you get it done. You can't you can't expect people to."
14110.0,Patient,You can't really work.
740.0,Provider,What doesn't work.
14110.0,Patient,"Either you want to do it, or you don't it's like you can want to do it and not really be quite able to make yourself do it like insist problem for years."
740.0,Provider,"But see the thing about it is it's not about making yourself do it, I mean it's not about it's not about the. process of doing it it's about like you said you have to make yourself do it. You have to do it anyway, even if you don't feel any kind of motivation and if you're looking for motivation, sometimes it does not come, which means you have to push yourself to do the things you don't want to do. And you got to keep doing it until motivation follow. Like I said it's all on Monday."
14110.0,Patient,Well i've already kept you late.
740.0,Provider,So let me let.
14110.0,Patient,"Usually, just an hour."
740.0,Provider,yeah. I like what you thought it every 30.
14110.0,Patient,"Oh that's right. For some reason my brain would say it's like Oh, we should have been over to."
740.0,Provider,"yeah you know, keep me like I said a few minutes before Monday fish. But I really, really, really, really, really, and I know it's hard and I know you like oh nice up question and i'm going to keep pushing you. i'm just going to be honest with you because the thing about it is, is it that's how that's, the only way that you're going to be in dispute the change that you want to see, and every time you find me back i'm gonna fight you every time you got some back to say I got more back to say."
14110.0,Patient,"my childhood, no."
740.0,Provider,"No know that has nothing to do with what she went through your childhood is not the same, because what i'm trying to do is i'm trying to make you better back then, in your childhood definitely better desktop neglect it's a difference so i'm not i'm not sure mama i'm not show Daddy."
14110.0,Patient,Having to perform for other people.
740.0,Provider,"it's not about performing for nobody you perform for you. Can i'll tell you a secret you don't, let me say something caitlin let me help you out i'm happy I real fast, but we go you're not performing for me Okay, I have a family, I have a job I have. You know performance, for me, I want you to have the same things that I do. And at the end of the day, we've all gone through trauma you've been abused so have I. you've had neglect so have you been abandoned So how do you know my all mama didn't even show them my way so honey, at the end of the day, i've been there and done it. i'm not selling you something I haven't been through so anytime I push you it's for a reason. If you want to wallow in the past, I understand it, but at the same time, you have to be able to progress, despite what you've been through we've all been through things. It has to do with the character of a person it's about the mindset of being able to push past what you've been through and to be successful, anyway. Despite the odds, despite what they say wouldn't work despite what they say couldn't work despite what they said you never be nothing prove them wrong and do it anyway. You just doing it anyway, so no."
14110.0,Patient,"The potential for success, I always had the potential for success. I could just never apply myself in ways that actually mattered."
740.0,Provider,"So do it now. Because the longer you wallow in stuff that you couldn't do in the past, the more it will continue to stunt your growth. You want progress and i'm gonna tell you why, because every time I say something you find a reason not to do it, so my thing is like this, all I can do is continue to give you the options. In order for this to work you have to put in their work, I wish I could do it for you, but I can. And I understand that child hooks up, I understand that the environment that you live in a toxic. i've been there i've been there, I know what it's like to live in a toxic environment. I know what it's like to live in an abusive abusive environment, I know what it's like to do all those things so you're not you're not telling me thing that I haven't experienced that myself, but I am telling you things that you have an experience at all. Which is why I continue to do it, I am not the people in your path they're pushed you to perform for them. I don't need you to perform, for me, this is not Barnum and Bailey this was not the ringling brothers we're not doing a circus I don't need you to perform, for me, I need you to perform for yourself. The only person that's in the audience, the only main character that as a part of the story is caitlin kinnick. Not now, you should wallace. So any performing that you do it will be for you, for you alone. So either you do it, or you don't. It really does boil down today. Because it's all about the way that you think you can either harbor in the pain, you can either let it continue to haunt you and to hold you hostage, or you can choose to be and do something better."
14110.0,Patient,See I just. heard that argument before to.
740.0,Provider,Her what argument before.
14110.0,Patient,know that you just have to do it.
740.0,Provider,Nice he came over.
14110.0,Patient,To and it didn't help so.
740.0,Provider,"I you're not a cancel your age how old, are you how are you. 2727 year old woman so i'm not talking to a seven year old caitlin. i'm sorry i'm to a 27 year Old Testament. They say they're back in the past in regards to forcing you to do something that you didn't want to do. i'm not forcing you to do anything you don't want to do you're saying that you want to move out of your parents house. you're saying that you want to be able to live on your own and be stable and get out of that environment in order to do that you're saying you have to be able to change your mindset, so that you can work so that you can earn a living, so that you can get out of there. Unless you get you a rich unless you get you a rich partner you're saying that they're willing to drop a few thousand all units sure, but I don't think I don't see that I don't see that comment. So the only thing you can do if that's what you want to do, and your goal is to get out, then all I can do is to help see what kind of plane and potential, you have to be able to you to make a dream a reality this is. I guess it, this is not your childhood. yeah the words may be repetitive, but the meanings are different and the circumstances are different and the situations are different. And this situation and circumstances different. I moved out of my parents house. I didn't like the environment that I was in so you know what i'd be I blessed mother and I went. And I just hey even if i'm not good at i'm gonna learn to be good in because I got to work side and as. I said it's all about mindset. We don't keep working on, if I can change in a day and I will change in a week but eventually you won't get sick Academy. And then i'll know what you're gonna want to do this, but. Like I said, the main thing for us to move forward. So. Next week I will be on vacation the whole week. I know you made your appointment already for the for the second one before the month and so."

I just started working here, so I don't know anything about having to do frequencies and all that kind of stuff I mean i'm still learning how to work, the system, so I don't even know how to do frequencies."
14110.0,Patient,gotcha.
740.0,Provider,But if you want to do weekly going to be 30 minutes if you want to do bi weekly.
14110.0,Patient,or bi weekly is probably better because it's not quite long enough.
740.0,Provider,"yeah so that's why I want to make sure, because, like they our I will make sure that you get your hour. there's a theory, because I know you need it so would that's why I, like you, ain't gotta leave I more thing about you kayla i'm not gonna cut you short.
