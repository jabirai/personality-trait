252.0,Provider,"And you're doing amazing but you need that other piece. You know if you talk to people you talk to people that have been in treatment and get out and then relapse every single one of them will tell you the same thing.

You know. Oh, I my choices opiates so I didn't think there was nothing wrong with you're going to beer."
9191.0,Patient,yeah totally.
252.0,Provider,"And so, knowing that that's absolutely true, you know we can cruise for a certain amount of time and stay sober but you want to do the work so it's like embedded and grounded and all that crap is gone and you can have freedom."

9191.0,Patient,yeah it's a little complicated.
252.0,Provider,"Well Okay, so they put in I don't get it, but they put in here this little program based off of the questions that you answer on a lot of your surveys, I think, is what it's based off of and, according to this, it says that you need. Medical appointments quarterly individual appointments twice a month group therapy quarterly drug screens quarterly."
9191.0,Patient,Or do these like what every four months.
252.0,Provider,every three months. um.
9191.0,Patient,I might be done to do the groups like my personal groups every. i'll talk to my group person right.
252.0,Provider,"About that yeah you talk to them um but it's same poor he he argues scores high treatment abandonment don't get it man compliance care intensity. Which is a crap which is crap because you've met you know, every time we have an appointment, you make it, so I think it's sometimes it's a skewed. Because it's not the accurate truth. Oh, I see, so you canceled one one therapy appointment and then one group. And that's what they base it off of. Oh, I see."
9191.0,Patient,"For the cancelled of the group, I told him to reschedule me I don't know why I told them, please make sure that put reschedule and i'm a cancer yeah I got you so i'll call the compliance Center on i'll let them know that."
