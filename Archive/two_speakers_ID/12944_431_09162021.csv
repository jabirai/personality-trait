12944.0,Patient,"What happened is that. I wanted to talk to share, because the medication doesn't help me anymore, because he would have been. pharmacy. is late, every time I suppose, to get the prescription filled their late, because the order is placed and then be done it's not in. Its not being on they don't have it in stock to become for the rest, and then he, like he. Was he was like three days so."
431.0,Provider,Oh no.
12944.0,Patient,"You didn't be yeah in the beginning, I was getting my medication Monday. Then moved. to Wednesday then we'll move to serve the last time I got it on Sunday, because they I mean they. When they get medications on the weekend, they. yeah so the thing is it's like. Every next time I start the cycle it doesn't feel the same so buying now I get maybe two hours really and I, I took the medication at. Six, and right now I don't feel the pains all back plus they have dinner up but it never goes away it's all it's all it's so suboxone doesn't have that at all. Like a pain in my news and thinking my. ankles It is like numb, but when I touch it ever everything flares up and I have a really big spots on my on my tie. Now my right."
431.0,Provider,leg yeah.
12944.0,Patient,"Is this is unknown, but when I when I touch it with the clothes, or like when i'm laying down he just flares up like i'm on fire."
431.0,Provider,That sounds like nerve related pain.
12944.0,Patient,So you know. The.
431.0,Provider,answer is probably not the best one to treat the nerve the are you taking anything for nerve related pain.
12944.0,Patient,"I was taking, but the thing is that I always always with the pain management that went out of business and when they went out of business, I number describe the medication, without taking before. Donna, and I still cannot find the the pain management I got I got with you guys because. colby or couldn't find anybody close to me pain management and because my pain was never under. Under six I cannot have a therapy anymore, and I have last time I had the MRI done, I had a bulging discs. Okay, and. happens if it happened just I don't even know i'm a little heavier on 250. pounds and I can just. suspected my torso is to have it for my lower back, but then my neck is all so."
431.0,Provider,"yeah sounds like you're. The cycle of pain and we probably want you know, we want to manage it to get out of that cycle right because you also talked about because you're paying you can't do some physical therapy or just strengthen your back. So we do well, I know we have a pain management doctor and she does see patients in California i'm not sure if she's still accepting new patients, I can ask and she often will do consults. If needed, but I will have to check in on that as far as. You know some of the symptoms that you reported, I will definitely let sure now it to me it sounds like you're kind of in a cycle, where the pain is not well controlled and then you're chasing the pain whenever you're chasing your pain, it always takes more to kind of treat it. On top of which I think you have neuropathic pain that. We a different medication will have to be prescribed to kind of address."
12944.0,Patient,"I tried to talk to share, about that, but would like no for next meeting and. Because I really want to see what's going on, because. yeah. I was really surprised how well they were. suboxone. And yeah all the sudden nothing like two hours gives me painted white Daddy in the. Nothing else.

12944.0,Patient,"yeah The thing is like a deer either out of medication. yeah they have right now, they have to prescriptions like in the pharmacy description, but still when it comes to the point that they feel they. They don't work they don't work they wait until the last day and then they tell me if they don't have it in stock and then, then they wait for yeah sometimes I mean I told you, the one one they they waited for.

12944.0,Patient,"Seven and four minutes, I was. I was yeah I was, I was first with the cl TV so shields. i'm telling you exactly the same. Okay, because right now, what is happening, they they don't read about the draft agents read the they know that people been dying because of opiates there is a crisis. yeah and their insurance insurance is pretty high. So some of the policies. don't even prescribe the opiates."
431.0,Provider,"And now, there has been. In how obo regulated and it's evolving home in. A better direction but I hear you there's been lots of change, so I guess our so changing pharmacy is not something that you want."

431.0,Provider,"Right So what do you want, what can I do for you, then you have your medicine right now. How can I."
12944.0,Patient,"Be only thing is, we don't want to make sure that they don't run off on Sunday."
431.0,Provider,"Yes, so we can definitely let share know about your situation, we could call in a verbal order for you just to have on file so it's ready for pickup um. And then also I can also double check with them to make sure that they get this you know get the order in before Sunday, when you go pick up."
12944.0,Patient,"yeah that could that could be because you think, then I don't have way because capital. I guess because. steak is paying for my station can refill the cannot refill my prescription two days before. yeah like I explain something so even if you call them today, I don't know if they will call in."
431.0,Provider,"So what they will. yeah so what so. there's two pieces occasion you know, I have to give them the order myself or you know. Once the order is then they can keep it on file, but like you said, the second step is actually filling it and charging to insurance, which is the state. That please tell me until Sunday. Because there's the math that the insurance or the state keeps track, so it won't pay for it again until Sunday that's what that means, but I can still give you order in so it's on file for you. um But OK, and it will you be seeing a doctor."
12944.0,Patient,I will try it.
