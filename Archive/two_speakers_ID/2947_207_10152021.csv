ID,Role,Message
2947.0,Patient,"Alright, how are you."
207.0,Provider,"i'm good, how are you. You feel better."
2947.0,Patient,yeah a little bit i'm sorry I go next week.
207.0,Provider,"Okay Okay, did you ever talk to Dr Jackson."
2947.0,Patient,I haven't had group again since last week.
207.0,Provider,OK OK.
2947.0,Patient,I grew up the day before I talk to you and then we'll take I don't have group so it'll be next Friday we'll talk to her anyhow.
207.0,Provider,OK OK so it's something that has been going on for a while.
2947.0,Patient,yeah.
207.0,Provider,"OK OK, so now you're getting to the point where it's becoming more concerning for you. Okay okay yeah I was definitely is it that you haven't seen your primary in a long time, but the reason why they gave me such a long appointment to wait for so."
2947.0,Patient,"Because it's not i'm also going to have my yearly physical when I go. Man doing r&d my Tele health for the most part, as they can which that they can't. And I somebody was in be out that far."
207.0,Provider,"OK OK and didn't because I know some doctors, the one after that did it with me, I found that was pretty cool is that they make you go do. Your blood work before you come in so once they get your blood work you do your blood work and then, when you go in for that annual they review the blood work right then and there with you."
2947.0,Patient,"i'm good I was expecting that they didn't do that, so far, but."
207.0,Provider,"it's something that you can ask the thing, given that you do have the appointment if. You know if it's a possibility, when. You, the order. ahead of time, so that when you go. There reviewing your global. But that's something that you can. Ask the teacher. Is this is not the first time you see."
2947.0,Patient,It is.
207.0,Provider,"yeah you know either way, the first time I saw this one doctor who did that I That was my i've never met them and they they have in the blood work. With a lot. that's how they did it so it was definitely more comforting because then they were reviewing everything. And so, as a review it whatever questions will pop up in your head whatever concerns and you could just have that discussion in comparison so having to wade into callbacks, and all this different."
2947.0,Patient,stuff right.
207.0,Provider,"yeah I you know if you could I would ask them see if they will be willing to do that because of whatever is going on, and so you know being pretty detailed because. sounds horrible but a doctor. A doctor is only as good as whatever you that you tell them. yeah they're only as good as what you're selling So if you don't tell them. they're they're not going to necessarily want to go down that rabbit hole pro they're like well, I mean maybe you ate something like really for a whole month really. it's definitely seeing about the good work and then going from there, but you. can see your faces so for everything you popped on and i'm like."
2947.0,Patient,Okay that's okay.
207.0,Provider,"that's the thing listen. Like I remember when my daughter was sitting in the hospital she came down today. And when she gained all the weight it was just like it was so good, and then, once she got to a certain number her doctor says, our lesson a stop on the way. So for to look so good, and I know you got your central work and everything, how do you feel about it."
2947.0,Patient,i'm good.
207.0,Provider,Okay.
2947.0,Patient,Are where all the time.
207.0,Provider,"Of course, of course, it does take a conscious effort to get up and. Because of the fact that your home, you make a conscious effort to do things to make yourself feel like you're actually going to like you know, for us, we all in telemedicine or tell us how you do everything from home or from the convenience of a private location. Or have you. And so, because you're not having to physically go to work, you still have to make a conscious effort to still make your. A certain day so it's. All about self care."
2947.0,Patient,Okay i'm sorry.
207.0,Provider,"I was getting a lot of background noise static like feedback. Can you hear me. Okay, this is what am I have to do because there's some kind of feedback going on."
2947.0,Patient,"Alright, can you hear me now."
207.0,Provider,yeah did you disconnect your bluetooth.
2947.0,Patient,"Yes, I did."
207.0,Provider,"Okay, let me see if that's what it was hold on one second. Because I was good to know i'm on my device audio there's nobody in here, so it just made some but i'm on my device audio now. Okay that's fine because I was hearing a whole lot of feedback, so I don't know, let me hold on one second I had to disconnect mind, because I thought it was mine. I thought it was my headset that was doing."
2947.0,Patient,also turn off your fluorescent lamp and that might have been doing it to.
207.0,Provider,know I think okay that's what it is because I reconnected my bluetooth I think it was your headset was giving a whole lot of feedback. Okay yeah.
2947.0,Patient,I can hear you though.
207.0,Provider,"yeah okay Okay, so no I was so how is your husband, in terms of you know, with you not feeling well and you're kind of everything that you have been going through like how supportive in."
2947.0,Patient,"India or whatever, not on it he's doing good. he's doing good. yeah."
207.0,Provider,"Okay, and he's been pretty like helpful and supportive and attentive. to you."
2947.0,Patient,The whole thing with him in general has been great. I couldn't tell you the last time we had an episode.
207.0,Provider,"Now, would you say that after your friend has been gone you haven't had an episode."
2947.0,Patient,Oh no we've had episodes.
207.0,Provider,you've had other soul.
2947.0,Patient,Lessons in frequency but.
207.0,Provider,"And, have you. Have you been able to identify. What triggers them."
2947.0,Patient,"know. It can be anything, and I mean he'll take it as though i'm bossing him to do something and i'm not I can be very mindful of how I asked ask something I mean it will be the sweetest kindest way like i'm walking on eggshells, and it can still send them off. So it."
207.0,Provider,will look like on a regular primary. Here you go and maybe that is something that.
2947.0,Patient,"He isn't a lot of pain, he has his knees are worn out, he was told years ago that he needed knee replacement he's, to the point where he cannot walk very far without having to have something to. depend on to help him, so I mean I know myself pain can be very, very aggravating and i'm sure he's annoying yeah men are the big 12 I can I can handle this."
207.0,Provider,"So mm hmm um and maybe that is something that, because if he hasn't gone in a long time, is he older or younger."
2947.0,Patient,he's older he's 5455.
207.0,Provider,Interesting has he has he had. done like his arm at this age like different exams like a colon.
2947.0,Patient,To stay or the colonoscopy or any of that note and going on to him about that one.
207.0,Provider,And then the reason why all of those things are important you don't mind has he gotten his did you guys get your vaccine.
2947.0,Patient,I did he did not. He doesn't he doesn't believe it.
207.0,Provider,and well.
2947.0,Patient,And I respect that.
207.0,Provider,"I mean yeah. And if each his own and while I respect it as well in in the sense of. It still comes down to your overall health. Because you know, one can feel like you got your vaccine and you know, some people identify you know side effects from getting the vaccine, but then you have to be so in tune that you notice that hey you know what I started. experiencing these things after I had the vaccine, it could be related or could be unrelated. One won't really know unless. i'm you know, some people they don't have anything going on, after you know it really just depends."
2947.0,Patient,i've been getting cold chills ever since I mean I never used to get cold chills.
207.0,Provider,Every.
2947.0,Patient,vaccine yep.
207.0,Provider,"Did you. Even feed into his items nice Nice. So um but, again, everybody has different symptoms or or or side effects or just whatever it is just like even have an actual coven no to people who will tell you they had experienced the same."
2947.0,Patient,coven so I mean you.
207.0,Provider,"know, everybody everybody, and you know the symptoms are different but part of the reason why I asked about the vaccine is just ultimately you really don't know what's going on, if you're not necessarily. You know, getting yourself checked out, and you know, we have our ways of. displaying symptoms of an underlying element. your husband could have a uti and because he's an old."
2947.0,Patient,told me that I remember you told me that yeah.
207.0,Provider,"yeah he can have a uti that our son he's cooking cooking you wondering well baxter is norm, he does, that all the time, but yeah, this is a little Sunday, so you know when was the last time. And so there's just so many different things and and you know, maybe taking it from an angle that just. pound."
2947.0,Patient,"It makes sense, because I know my history of ut is come and go. i'm really bad at eyes and you know beats, and the reason I have him he could probably have them to and. In, then I don't know they come and go, like they do and women, but that would also make."
207.0,Provider,"you're talking about whatever triggers it. um I forgot what whatever I said it's something that's acidic in your body or whatever that causes them and they're very sudden in terms of a shift in that, like a sudden it's almost like. On psychosis almost is what it displays as you become very forgetful your belligerent and it could just be a urinary tract infection and depending on the severity of it. It could all be related, but if you're not going to the doctor to just check up on yourself giving your age and it's just one of those things where. You know, regardless of you want to get vaccinated or not regardless, if you want to do all these different things that they're recommending or not it's silly you it's still good for you to do your due diligence and just getting checked. out just to make sure, because life is not about like my thing is, you know we all have our different opinions eyes it's not all about colon. At the end of day diabetes so exit strokes Elizabeth partners disease phyllis Is this all kind of other ailments still exists, they didn't go nowhere they're all there it's just that right now. Though the cloud that we're living under his coven and so you know, maybe just letting them know like hey it's really important for you i'm just together valuation and see if there's anything going on, because i'm sure you want him to be around long term, just like."
2947.0,Patient,"anybody else do it for me do it for your mom or your dad do it for do it for the rest of us, and something else, and this might help my car my case here is that his health insurance is offering him $100 and he'll go physical so."
207.0,Provider,"Our physical. I put 100,000 physical 90 and 100 hospital vaccine, because you know what have you ain't gonna do nothing helped me with no side effects the hvac."
2947.0,Patient,"Guy right right right but. First, physical."
207.0,Provider,"Just for the listeners don't get listings go get the physical and after we get $100 after you get your physical, we will get something he will go out on the big about that. So it is something yes to to try to help the case is because it could be anything in terms of you haven't gotten these certain um you know things like afterwards, after the age of 40 because women, we have to get certain on examination."
2947.0,Patient,"guilty i'm guilty, as can be on this one, I put it off put it off and I can't pull it off and."
207.0,Provider,You come on mammogram.
2947.0,Patient,i'm talking about pap smear.
207.0,Provider,Oh yeah I mean I hear you I mean nobody wants to run.
2947.0,Patient,"I know I mean i've already had issues in the past, my mom had issues and."
207.0,Provider,"yeah and it's just one of those things that. We avoid it we procrastinate. or anxiety goes up and it and all of those. descriptions that i've given you comes from a place of. You don't want to get bad news, but the truth of the matter is bad news comes with a normal rate of blood test. You understand, so it is. Going and getting it on your own in comparison to something horrible happened you're passing out or something bad happening, and you don't know and then they tell you that an intervention could have been taken had you done it. long ago so. it's a you know, and I know you guys are not in my group anymore, but that's one of the things that I I I encourage everybody to do and I don't know if i'm I think levada whoever your facilitator, is that. Julie Julie, is that what Julian yeah Julie, is the facilitator about rejection, the writer, but. it's just important for us to. go and get checked out what is internal because even though, yes, we work on the mental health component, but the truth of the matter is a lot of. Why, we have all of these things that mentally, whether it be anxiety, the fear, all of these other things is because something is going on within us. and listen, I have seen P patient. This close to being diagnosed with dementia or having a diagnosed and being on long term. Medicine i'm anti our psychotropic medication and it was as if you see it. Good good good good take the magic pill, and the beauty is gone. And you're back to yourself, but let anything left on treated eventually become a lifelong problem. Because we live right through that, and so I will definitely encourage you to do the things that you need to do him sometimes once we start our body starts showing indicators severe in the symptoms are there a difference of your sentence is because we ignored mile one. Right, you know, and so I really encourage both have that on to happen."
2947.0,Patient,"Other he can be having other problems, and he would never tell me."
207.0,Provider,"This man it's. unfortunate that you're looking at them and i'm like I know you live in I know your line. I know nothing is wrong. So, and because they don't want to worry you or if you lie, a lot of pride lot of time. alone."
2947.0,Patient,"yeah it is, it is a nice yeah he's one of those that will not ask for help you know he's from that old mentality you don't ask for help you just do it, you figure out a way and."
207.0,Provider,Your friend on the back and then the whole different story.
2947.0,Patient,"And then you're fine, no, no i'm fine i'm fine if I promise."
207.0,Provider,yeah yeah no I.
2947.0,Patient,"mean he I mean he had his appendix ruptured and he was he said he was fine this before I met him, but his mom is telling me about it and he's just he's he's that type."

2947.0,Patient,about it.
207.0,Provider,We gotta do we gotta.
2947.0,Patient,"that's The next step, but we're gonna. we're gonna hold off on that one."
207.0,Provider,Sometimes you gotta call out and big guns in time yeah.
2947.0,Patient,It.
207.0,Provider,"So it's you know it listen you just do what you have to do just to just to keep it's all about our mental physical spiritual. Just balance in all of it emotionally all of it just needs to be in balance and you'll find that, once all of it is in balance, I think you know you think about like the piece. That you have it's like One of those is is. it's a biblical saying that a peace that surpasses all understanding is when you think about peace that surpasses all understanding is like all of it is imbalanced you can't explain it you just feel it you just know it. And that's ultimately what you work on you know, yes you're working on your mental yet, but you know what about your physical and often times we neglect our physical it on get up because we're just so hyper focused in one area. how's everything else going. In terms of. The boy you're going."

207.0,Provider,"Are requested requesting if they would be okay with you going one point since you're. On your profile and everything else and pretty much been progressing you don't understand like when you do the program like you get these things, and they wonder like why.

207.0,Provider,Oh you're in La so come by or you don't.
2947.0,Patient,"I don't know it depends on what the plans are with my husband's brother and their kids and all if they do something with them, we won't but otherwise we might. It just depends, I mean we're we never really do anything."
207.0,Provider,gotcha gotcha gotcha getting called up area.
2947.0,Patient,"Not cold mm hmm I haven't had to have a jacket, yet in the evenings I have to wear long sleeves but that's because i'm called nature, now I get cold chills all the time, so."
207.0,Provider,"I will, when you go to the doctor I would even tell them that you know, once you got the vaccine you found that right after the one thing, the one big difference is that you get you get cultures all the time."
2947.0,Patient,"And I know they say that that's a possible side effects, but it should go away Miami."
207.0,Provider,yeah yeah and because I think it's six months after your second if it was a two one What did you get I.
2947.0,Patient,had to I had to I had the booster.
207.0,Provider,Hopefully you got the booster already.
2947.0,Patient,"you're already yeah. I didn't have a third one, I had the second one in two weeks after two weeks or a month after it was it was all right there together."
207.0,Provider,"Okay, what is it i'm gonna burn and you."
2947.0,Patient,know I got the Pfizer.
207.0,Provider,"Oh cuz I know one of them, you have to get another the third one. So they've been talking about it."
2947.0,Patient,Either I don't want the third one.
207.0,Provider,"Okay, so they announced it on the news that you don't get the phone."
2947.0,Patient,Because I didn't know that okay well. And she's not getting the third one.
207.0,Provider,"They like I or my sister I said honey you gotta you gotta get the other one too, you know they just made the announcement that you know they're coming out with a third one that you have to get. And they said that the Madonna think is more effective than the other ones for the third one, and you got to the chicken soup. So, but but either way, I would still have a conversation with a doctor that hasn't gone away, yet you don't you never know, is it is it related or is it unrelated again always keep in mind a doctor is only as good as what you tell them."
2947.0,Patient,"Right I realized that and I mean i'm also in menopause and i'm not getting hot flashes so maybe these are called flashes. Oh, I know that's a possibility as well."
207.0,Provider,You are young you're getting your premenopausal.
2947.0,Patient,Already menopausal I haven't had a period of three years.
207.0,Provider,"Oh. Wonderful. it's great. Well, again still talking and because you know, again, you know my philosophy when you're dealing with medical stuff and as much as I have. The body is so complex, and I know one person on earth really understands it and it's still just everyone just funny the body and so. You know you don't know when you when we take any vaccines or any kind of medication or anything you don't know if it throws off one thing. to fix or another, and so, those are things that you talk to the doctor about and they can help you before they offer you another pill to take it's just saying hey what are these things, but again, given that you are in menopause it's definitely also talking to your. and talking to your. gynecologist. will make those appointments on, I think it will put you at ease. Regardless of your family history, I think it's also good to know that you are in good health, nobody wants to know that very something wrong, but at least, knowing that i'm in good health is always make me rest easy and it takes away at least that part of the anxiety. But let's make our next appointment one. You want to do the same time."
2947.0,Patient,"yeah this is, I can remember 11 o'clock."
207.0,Provider,alright.
