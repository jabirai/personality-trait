724.0,Provider,"That definitely helps. But obviously it's like everything else so close to that you get to it, the more expensive, it is you know because they're getting desperate. If you try to like plan out tickets to an advanced when gas prices are good, because you know jets run on fuel and if the price of oil is low, like the cheaper the ticket so like. Going when it like right after a hurricane or something like that, where you know gases like three something you know 350 a gallon like that the Prague, and I mean that your gas can be expensive or your trips going to be expensive.

724.0,Provider,"Okay um. You were thinking about like tapering off to a lower dose That way, you can I mean if you're going, you know every other day practically with it, if you went to a lower dose you could eventually taper off not need to be on it at all. I mean that's that that's kind of like a long term goal that everybody should kind of have."
12908.0,Patient,"yeah I mean, to be honest, like what Why do take it is like half of it sometimes whole thing but, since it is half of it. I just it's like I said, like sometimes I have I got a product page on my legs. yeah like in sleep so like a nice little I always rock myself to sleep, since I was really little baby. And then, when I have like these, chronic pains on my leg of my foot I can't sleep So then, then I have like I got a ticket and then i'll take a full one. Then 20 minutes later i'm knocked out sleeping all right."
724.0,Provider,"All right, well keep it on the back of your head that's possibility. You definitely need to start showing up because there's a red flag, and here it says, like you, must be seen three times a week or recommended for higher level of care. Basically, they would recommend you for like intensive outpatient someplace else. So missing the appointments is not helping you, with your compliance that's what it looks like."
12908.0,Patient,yeah sure. i'm so sorry but we'll see what happens.
724.0,Provider,yeah. yeah let's see what it says. How often do you see how often do you see chantelle.

724.0,Provider,"Oh that's cool. I was getting nervous about those things like TVs or. they're not as heavy as I used to be well, but they are most certainly costly, I always get nervous that they're going to like fall down or like break out of the wall, if you got like like a like a bad start or a band pokemon just collapses."
12908.0,Patient,it's happened to me before like I live in Massachusetts. And I come back from work my tv's on the floor. The plugin a chunk of the walls. yeah. that's what it is.

724.0,Provider,yeah when it comes to stuff like that you don't want to you don't want to go cheap on that because long term create a whole bunch of financial issues for you.

12908.0,Patient,"Research, you know."

724.0,Provider,And where is it is he in San Francisco to or no.
12908.0,Patient,"So I live in the Bay I say San Francisco as reference, but in Jose looks like a little like an hour from."
724.0,Provider,"But doctors, like in your in your general area right. orange county to get done."
12908.0,Patient,"I know. 10 minutes at first, I had to go travel back to La. But then I translate everything got a new doctor. I don't that's good."
724.0,Provider,"um how's the House of mental health any issues, I think you, you always like the band seven and the pH Q survey so it's hard to tell. Where you're at as far as the surveys go."
12908.0,Patient,I don't really need to I mean I gotta do it because it's my responsibility. right but i'm good with mental health i'm not. I don't want to say i'm mentally strong.
724.0,Provider,"Stable no issues, no, no. pressure in the past month or so feel good."
12908.0,Patient,"No, no, no, just like so the only thing I think about like what gets me down into the rest of fighting my my my addiction and stuff and all that stuff but, like other than that, like i'm good i'm good with like with HIV and those thoughts to and. Then every day that goes by, I feel better you know me about a bit more."
724.0,Provider,And you haven't had any slips the past month.
12908.0,Patient,"With drugs. yeah I remember, I told you."
724.0,Provider,"Why, I haven't talked to in a bond so since then."
12908.0,Patient,"Oh no I yeah I had that time. I was here remember, I told you, it was that the media and he thought it wasn't there, so I said at the meeting."
724.0,Provider,So you probably all right yeah yeah okay.
12908.0,Patient,"I spect out that I said it was everybody. On Tuesday. But that that day didn't like I did it for like four days in a row, and then I was like Fuck it. I stopped again. Okay yeah."
724.0,Provider,"Well it's good it's a obviously you're still you're still in the recovery process so you're going to have slips here and there, it's a it's more important that you bounce back quicker than you then just going off the rails. So, as long as you're. Being insightful and learning from the experience it's not a failure, you just gotta be you gotta be careful of like the pitfalls of it. And yeah getting back to it right. tolerances aren't what they used to be, you know I mean you might think that they still are, but they're not especially if you've been on suboxone for a little bit. So yeah you just got to be be mindful, and I mean don't take any unnecessary risks."
12908.0,Patient,"yeah sure I doing like shit That was a slip that it only happened because of the situation like I didn't go look for it, you know. No."
724.0,Provider,"trouble will find us even when we're not looking for it, and I mean just you got to be aware, for it."
12908.0,Patient,"Especially now that I do want to stop it feels like it's like more temptations, and like more like there's like the pressure is harder I guess."
724.0,Provider,"yeah that makes sense yeah you're looking for you're looking to make like positive change with this still a like a portion of closure that's going to keep creeping up on you, you know what I mean like letting go is super hard to do. yeah just about anything and but you're close to that commitment, and you will be tempted so progress is progress, no matter. how long it takes or how little it takes as long as you're actively trying and that's progress if you get complacent and you get you catch like a case of the. screw it's you know what I mean like that's where it gets risky so just you know, keep working hard and then eventually you won't have to work hard anymore it'll just become your norm, but in the meantime, you know just."
12908.0,Patient,"That That was what I was gonna mention, too, is like like you said, like my normal again I happened for so long, it became kind of like a routine and kind. Like doing it anymore, so I kind of feel like you're missing something but you're not."
724.0,Provider,"Right yeah I mean the. Wer were pre programmed to settle into routines and when we change a known pattern. or a behavior that's where anxiety comes from, because then you're like oh shit I used to do this now, not a note to do. But they say like 30 days you know you're just going to fill that time, whatever that thing used to be, however long it used to take you have to fill that time with something else, and that becomes a new thing. it's like smoking cigarettes right so like most people that smoke, you know. One of the first things they do in the morning with their coffee smoke a cigarette after dinner smoke a cigarette with, especially if you work in restaurants, after the rush smoke a cigarette and it's like. Five minutes is really from start to finish, is the average time it takes to smoke a cigarette so it's like you're going to find something that preoccupied those five minutes in the beginning, it sucks."
12908.0,Patient,yeah.
724.0,Provider,"Two weeks into it it's like oh yeah yeah I used to do that it's whatever and in four weeks you're like oh yeah I got this whole new thing that you do after the rush I clean up. or first thing in the morning, I get coffee and I I walk outside for five minutes go get a check the mail I leave I leave the mail from the day before out there, so it gives me something to do for five minutes in the morning, so like little little tricks. That you can start setting yourself up for."
12908.0,Patient,yeah.
724.0,Provider,"you're gonna you're going to fill that gap, maybe it's not five minutes for you, maybe it's 20 minutes when you start occupying that time with something else that eventually the anxiety goes away the disruption goes away and it just becomes like your norm, you know what I mean."
12908.0,Patient,Exactly exactly and like they say what did you do something for like 23 days straight it's like you're automatically.
724.0,Provider,"yeah. Yes, I like that, like you, can you can learn new routines and new habits like 30 days they call it like 30 day challenges right so like. Like you, pick that thing where it's like yeah we do 25 push ups, a day and you challenge yourself and you make sure you get it done, you know it's like a 30 day challenge so. You."
12908.0,Patient,Already.
724.0,Provider,"yeah yeah sometimes it takes 60 days, whatever or a three month challenge you know but. Just setting the groundwork will eventually lead to successful outcomes, you know, but a lot of people who are you know they're scared of change, nobody likes change, but sometimes you have to do it long term it's it'll better you for it does that make sense, yes, it does yeah."
12908.0,Patient,And it was gonna be gone with the. right on day like you said in like fastest this process there's no like timeline for it yep.
724.0,Provider,"yep yeah I mean if you if you look at, like some of the old school a guys and stuff like that you know what I mean like you know that. they've been in recovery for 20 years but before that they had 10 years of like rocky roads so really they didn't like in an active pursuit of recovery for 30 years you know what I mean like talk to someone the old salty guys. You know what I mean and it's. it's progress but it takes a long time, have you ever heard of late, like the Greek mythology his Sufis."
12908.0,Patient,know.
724.0,Provider,"Did you have it so. You might know so like the story of his of his that he was like condemned to hell and part of his trial for eternity in hell. was a push a giant boulder up a hill all day just push this giant boulder up a hill all day and then, when he got to the top the day would reset and the boulder would fall down and crush him. And then he would wake up and have to do it all over again, you know what I mean you just push that rock up the hill every day and it crushes you and you wake up you just keep doing and that's like the story of progress, you know. Hopefully you don't get crushed to death it's a it's a horrible like like metaphor, but but that's what it is like in the beginning you're just pushing it. pushing the rock push the rock which the rock eventually you'll get to the top and it might fall back and crushes and just do it again and you do to getting to it again and eventually you won't have to do it anymore, no you'll have been successful and you would have mastered your time. You know, but it's it's hard work."
12908.0,Patient,"it's everything's hard work, I think ED."
724.0,Provider,"yep yep the existential outlook on life is that it's super difficult, you know you know and we haven't pretty pretty easy and a lot of things are accessible here in this country. You live in other places it's even worse, you got to deal with environmental factors and cultural factors and no running water, you know we got it relatively easy. But still, the struggle is real for anybody."
12908.0,Patient,i'm from Brazil so.
724.0,Provider,yeah what's like the biggest export that brazil's got it's like a Brazilian jujitsu. Good looking women and then homicides. Like that that's that's Brazil. yeah a huge tourist attraction down there the favelas. yeah. i'd imagine it's pretty dicey.
12908.0,Patient,And I don't want a coven but. visit soon.
724.0,Provider,"yeah I haven't heard anything about Brazil and a long time, like there's no new has come out of Brazil."
12908.0,Patient,gone.
724.0,Provider,"yeah it's crazy all right. Well, good man i'm glad, things are doing good for you. start showing up the group."
12908.0,Patient,yeah I will.
724.0,Provider,"set an alarm, you only have to see me twice a month, so that's pretty easy you know what I mean like we have four weeks to get two sessions in don't need be, but those a. You can't make up the group, if you miss the group you can't make it up so it's only for an hour, you know what I mean I keep it pretty short for the most part."
12908.0,Patient,So yeah i'll be there i'll be there.
724.0,Provider,"Alright man, do you need anything else that you're talking about."
12908.0,Patient,"i'm good man, are you gonna get these compliance back to green."
724.0,Provider,"yo yo yo to surveys, you got group and four days so. i'm done. All right, buddy be good. For transcription That was the individual session for the souza why. discussed his compliance concerns. I updated his care intensity. And we'll see if he shows up on Tuesday, for the group, thank you."
