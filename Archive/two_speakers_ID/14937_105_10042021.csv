Or if you need to take a little walk around the room just let me know whatever you need to do to take care of yourself because i'll be kind of tacky talking about some some history that might be triggering for you, I won't be getting into the why again it'll just be quick, short answers. I want to just quickly at least introduce myself so Jeff some idea of who you work with."

And I just seemed very intrigued i'm. intrigued with it, so that."
14937.0,Patient,"Everybody has something to use it seems in their family, now I mean it's. it's part of the world today, so you should be interested now it's pretty interesting."
105.0,Provider,"The majority of the work that I do, though, realistically, is will end we're going to start well i'll be getting a history of your substance use history, but the treatment itself. As you heard me talk about in group is going to be addressing that early trauma whether it was just neglect or French suffocation or whatever it was in in. You know whether it was a complex trauma situation or sometimes people have shock events that happened through car accidents through abuse neglect, we have an opportunity to reprocess those things in therapy. But today i'm going to be asking you questions and what will be most useful that i've seen work is i'm going to be saying things like age of first shoes, what was the progression how much so they'll be. Okay, so my first impression here today is not a great one because i'm sort of very definitive and just trying to sort of meet this objective, but that's.

I said it's simply something i'm i'm doing my own I need to find somebody who will listen to. And after all is said and done, I sent in all of the required paperwork my license etc um that's when he said after it was often as well we don't treat with your type of medication, but we do treat with suboxone. did some history on it and I seen it was created for pain, but I don't know if it's still not approved in the US for that I don't know but I thought, let me try it my body might adapt i'm in pain and i'm miserable and if you mean is health. I don't know. i'm not sick."
105.0,Provider,"Oh so sherry, thank you for sharing that let's persevere through the assessment and then continue to see if we need to schedule something with a physician one on one because it does sound like you could use some some psychotherapy as support for whatever this. This other. So we can look at it from that perspective. Sure, but we won't have that option if we don't continue so let's continue any any a or na attendance. No treatment history, please transcribe we're going to shift gears when a change. To a category of this is what you were alluding to earlier. Which is the sake, is stray.

105.0,Provider,"Okay i'm unclear, if it was the effect of the medication or not. I gotcha. All right, and so we have volume cymbalta and then there might have been something else but you're not sure, and you can. There are a few okay."
14937.0,Patient,"yeah some of them, made it like very much like a homicidal. i've never in my life had been so violently angry inside that I was concerned, as I want this. And it went away."
105.0,Provider,it'd be good to get to know what that is.
14937.0,Patient,i'll get i'll get.
105.0,Provider,It doesn't have to be right now okay so we'll continue i'm going to be focusing now specifically on. Things like suicidal ideation now was there ever a time when you were younger that you thought about ending your life.

105.0,Provider,"Well, I heard it yesterday. Yes, yeah if that can be the case. Sometimes people have passive ones where they are reckless they won't wear a helmet they won't wear a seat belt they sort of hope that they accidentally die. So yours might be passive um those are things I definitely want to know about, I want to be able to help so don't feel shy about telling me okay i'm glad you did just now, you told me. i'm separate from the suicidal ideation sometimes people will engage in self injury, they will burn their own skin cut their own skin or excessively tacked to to bring relief, ironically, from the mind, they will sort of. you're nodding your head tell me about what you do."
