706.0,Provider,"yep no bad happens, so we have about 20 minutes so tell me what."
13419.0,Patient,And then yesterday they I don't know what happened yesterday I think they sent me to a different room or something like that.
706.0,Provider,"yeah because well I I saw that you checked in. And so I was sitting in my my waiting room and then nobody showed up and so Finally, it was like I don't know it was probably like. 20 after I called it, I called it a no show, because obviously there was nobody that came in, so I don't I don't know what happened a couple of times just a happened with another patient too, so I wonder if. there's somebody maybe that's newer something that maybe accidentally sent them to the wrong room but. yeah things like that happen. So so what's been going on."
13419.0,Patient,"um. it's you know the same same stuff just just trying to deal with work and. I did have some some issues you know time to stay on track. did have a couple of a setback, so I need to talk to him."
706.0,Provider,yeah let's talk.
13419.0,Patient,"yeah. um yeah I think it's just been. Like with stress, maybe you know just doing with everything and I don't know I don't know what caused it for me to just. To just have a setback, you know just I was thinking about it, the other days like I don't know why I. I. let it happen or. Just something I just tapped and then I think button so after you know it's like. What a big mistake and."
706.0,Provider,So. Before you had. Your relapse what what was going on.
13419.0,Patient,"um. I think he says his word because it's just usual stuff you know, like with work. Because I know we're working a lot over time and then, of course, I have a. You know my family members, asking me. For favors and you know I just sometimes they get overwhelmed and you know I just i'm that type of person, where I can say no to my family, you know, to help them out. And then. So I have and i'm a i'm a single father and my daughter full time, so you know that's another. that's a lot yeah I have to deal with the House and you know. Making sure she has everything she needs and. The. Food So yes."
706.0,Provider,So. Hold your daughter. she's 1717. You don't look like you should have a 17 year old daughter just just.
13419.0,Patient,yeah no I get that a lot.
706.0,Provider,So um and she lives with you how's that relationship.
13419.0,Patient,"that's really good. she's oh she's been really good she's not really you know. The type of girl to be you know, on the streets, you know with friends that she shouldn't be with. and easily. easily on track with school and you know not gain are falling behind or. shouldn't so and then our relationship is real good like ever since. me my mom split up and she decided to stay with me like a relationship is got done a lot closer we. Have a lot more. are more open with each other and. Of course I tell her I try to tell her everything cuz like the only person that I talked to the most you know."
706.0,Provider,When you open with her about your relapse.
13419.0,Patient,i'm in a way yeah I. I started to told her and and and I can tell yeah she got a little bit upset that upset me to. let down so.
706.0,Provider,"yeah well, I mean she's she's upset because she's worried about you, because you're her dad. But yeah you know sounds like she's supportive and you know loving as well, so."
13419.0,Patient,I mean yeah.
706.0,Provider,"All of those things are really good. So you think it's just. Just the stress of it, or do you think because um. How long have you been on man's."
13419.0,Patient,"um. And even under new meds. yeah, so I think now I think it's been. it's been like a month since I started so or maybe like a month and we started. I did have. I did have a issue, of course, the first you know, the first week, you know how to live up and then, when I got right back on track. It lasted for about like a good to to a little over two weeks, I was doing good and staying on track and then one day it was just no. No, I had I not had an issue with medication. To at one point, but that shouldn't be an excuse, and I was thinking about it, like oh I didn't get my medication on time so."
706.0,Provider,"yeah yeah so. I think the one thing to look at potentially as maybe meeting with. The medical provider and talking to them to make sure that your doses cracked and that you don't need like an increase, like a bump up yes you're so new. You know, also just being able to recognize kind of those. warning signs before you. Have a relax. Is there anything that you kind of see yourself thinking or doing before you actually have a relapse."
13419.0,Patient,"Maybe. Maybe try to like talk to somebody I guess I know when we had our group meetings on a mentality to try to. kind of find like a. Like another I guess like another group meeting, where I can you know just go to whenever I you know can. You know they told that there's a lot online a lot of different places online record just log on and talk to somebody uh huh."
706.0,Provider,"There is, and then. there's other like so i'm Fridays, I have what they call a care group meeting which. is for people that are kind of struggling and so as long as your insurance will cover it and you don't have another appointment that same day with anybody from bright heart. to attend that group as well if you need a little support, so you can talk to the virtual clinic about potentially if your insurance will cover."
13419.0,Patient,Okay.
706.0,Provider,Do you think that'd be something you might be interested in.
13419.0,Patient,yeah I think so okay.
706.0,Provider,"So yeah we just. have to the virtual clinic even when we're done here go back to the virtual clinic and just. inquire if that would be something that we could do, and we could increase if we needed to increase your care intensity, so that you could do two groups, a week. You know just you know for a certain amount of time, just so that you feel more stable."
13419.0,Patient,yeah.
706.0,Provider,Do you think that would be helpful.
13419.0,Patient,"yeah I think it could be, you know i'm not sure what other what other ways would be helpful to, but I know I know you know talking usually out because it's. You know it's there's not that many people going through you know what i'm going through so. Not like anybody or I could just I used to have a friend that you know that did. go through going through the same issue, but he passed away so he was like going first. And it was just recently too so it's. it's too bad. He was."
706.0,Provider,friend that passed away mean that's a lot to weigh on you as well.
13419.0,Patient,Oh yeah. yeah.
706.0,Provider,Did did they pass away from substance use or find something else.
13419.0,Patient,"i'm know from something else he um he needed to get on on a program and I was helping out but um. He had cancer years back, so I can go with just from yeah he got he got real sick and. I think it was from the cancer is what what made him more sick again. You know. in and out of hospital but. yeah. He was doing good on his Program. And and yeah that's what that's sort of one of the main reasons that made me you don't want to start doing it is. always told him that I wanted to. You know, get clean and stuff so okay."
706.0,Provider,"So and um yeah there's I mean there's a ton of different forums and meetings online if you just type in you know. Meetings for opioid disorder support meetings for opioid disorder it'll pop them up, and most of them are virtual and you can attend them across the country so. You know Ohio you can attend one in California, or you know, whatever. it's um so it's kind of cool that way because some people are afraid if they go to like a local meeting somebody might see them, and you know and yeah and this way you're just kind of a stranger to everybody."
13419.0,Patient,"So I think I did try to like be. blogging on talking, you know I didn't really talk sort of sat and listened and uh huh. How to get. familiar with everybody and well yeah that's so. that's what they said in the group, you know you get. Sometimes you'll find a place to where you log on all the time, where you know there's people there that are. there all the time and then they get to know you so. To be open and talk."
706.0,Provider,"yeah yeah you can you can form kind of relationships that way you can also kind of find your leg home meeting you know we always hope that you're bright heart the meetings that you attend you kind of have that make that becomes your home meeting kind of like your recovery family. And I feel like you know the groups, you know that I facilitate that's really that really happens like people really come together and they're supportive and non judgmental and you know I really push that because that's the whole point of having a group is."
13419.0,Patient,is to be able to share.
706.0,Provider,That feeling that there's going to be backlash. So um since.
13419.0,Patient,"My group meetings that I, on Friday, with everybody everybody's nice yeah good."
706.0,Provider,um so i'm. sent you had your relapse how long has it been.
13419.0,Patient,"um it's been. been more than a week and then. So the other thing too is that our supposed to i'm supposed to have my. The urine test. and And I didn't want to do it, while I was dirty so I kept off from doing it because I wanted to get back on track and then since then, I guess, my doctor saw that I didn't do it so she didn't give me my medicine Friday. So. Well, I got you know I try to get myself back on track and then I that's what I did yesterday, I took the test and and and hopefully she'll see that you know I took the test and. And then. and hopefully she'll give me my my medication by I think."
706.0,Provider,Your doctor.
13419.0,Patient,"Santo Escobar okay okay yeah Oh, they told me to she wanted. last group meetings I should have a to make sure people had an appointment with her once a month, all the new people and. And I made an appointment with her um. I think it's under 13 or 16 on to see her."
706.0,Provider,Okay.
13419.0,Patient,"i'm not sure if she'll see you know, on the Friday in group, you know everything should be caught up on my side so."
706.0,Provider,yeah. If you just let her know that you went ahead and did that then she can check the the record and it'll show that you're backing so that's good.
13419.0,Patient,um yeah.
706.0,Provider,Since you had your relapse till present how have you felt.
13419.0,Patient,"yeah not good it's been. You know it's just full of regret and. then go like my old South you know square comes out, you know. Forget about things, or you know be too lazy to be to do things and. yeah it's just a feeling that you know I don't like and it just you know I just get taken to. To a dark side, where I just know I just feel like blocking people out sometimes okay. yeah."
706.0,Provider,Okay um when you relapsed did you get high from the drugs that you used like making you normally did or did you find that the effects were last.
13419.0,Patient,"um. yeah I guess it was. The same like I usually do it out that's that's what kept me going after that you know I did. It wasn't like one time and then that's good yeah it was. A day after that and then another day yeah that's right I just started from there, so okay."
706.0,Provider,"So when you meet with chantel definitely let her know those things, and definitely let her know that when you used you still felt really high. hmm um. Because I think that's important for her to know."
13419.0,Patient,Okay.
706.0,Provider,"um. So, and since your relapse Have you had have you been triggered or had cravings to us again."
13419.0,Patient,um yeah pretty much yeah okay.
706.0,Provider,And what are you doing when you have those.
13419.0,Patient,um. I usually. Just. Take a pill pretty much swallow it.
706.0,Provider,"Okay, so what other coping skills, can you utilize when you feel like you might be slipping to kind of get your mind off of it."
13419.0,Patient,not too sure.
706.0,Provider,Do you have any.
13419.0,Patient,hobbies or anything that you.
706.0,Provider,"Like to do that, you can kind of just get lost in."
13419.0,Patient,"yeah I mean. I think sometimes like the. occupy play sometimes my brother he does play games with me online like the video games. Online from his house, you know. Well yeah that's usually you know when I when I have time to do it. You know. yeah usually I stay busy and that's The other thing you know."
706.0,Provider,"Staying busy is really important. I think that. anything you can do to redirect that energy that you're putting into the cravings and being triggered into something positive, is going to be really good like maybe. You feel like you're kind of having a bad day you're feeling like you have some cravings or you're being triggered."
13419.0,Patient,You know.
706.0,Provider,"Maybe go for a walk or you know spend some time with your daughter or um i'll play games online just something to redirect your attention. yeah because typically they pass so just like when somebody stopped smoking, they have those cravings to smoke a cigarette but if they get themselves busy doing something typically that that that trigger and that craving will pass for the time being."
13419.0,Patient,until the next.
706.0,Provider,One comes on and then you just kind of do that same thing and then the goal is hopefully those cravings and triggers will be less than less.
13419.0,Patient,yeah yeah. yeah so i'm hoping so i'll tell my doctor that you know that yeah definitely.
706.0,Provider,"You definitely want to be very open and honest with the doctor, as far as how you're feeling your relapses. How you felt when you relapse does far as like you know how high you got how you felt how long you were using all of those things is that makes a difference to how your medication as prescribed."
13419.0,Patient,yeah yeah I like science yes i'm ready okay.
706.0,Provider,"Well, I hate to cut it short today, but I have to get to my group um do you have another appointment set up with me in a couple weeks."
13419.0,Patient,um no I don't think.
706.0,Provider,"So when we when you leave my room go back to the virtual clinic you can ask them about additional groups, if your insurance will cover that, and you can also have them schedule your next appointment for two weeks out."
13419.0,Patient,weeks okay.
706.0,Provider,"yep two weeks so that to be in compliance, you have to meet with your therapist two times a month, so, and you can schedule them both at the same time, if you want to get on get them on the books, so he can just talk to them, and they can help you with that."
13419.0,Patient,"Okay sounds good. Okay, all right, thank you appreciate it."
706.0,Provider,yeah you're welcome we'll hang in there.
13419.0,Patient,"Okay, I will thank you."
706.0,Provider,yeah bye bye.
