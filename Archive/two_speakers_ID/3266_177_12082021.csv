177.0,Provider,Are you.
3266.0,Patient,"i'm good, how are you."
177.0,Provider,Good nice to see you one a month.
3266.0,Patient,I know. doesn't happen that often.
177.0,Provider,We have you been up to.
3266.0,Patient,pretty much just working like work is work in school is literally my life lately. completely.
177.0,Provider,No talking about that and grouping and me just working these expensive hours and additional school and transition of being Roma.
3266.0,Patient,"And that's the hardest part, I think, is not being able to have him, like all on the weekend, you know because we started out when he was first born, of course, I was with my daughter, for the first week. And then. Just you know, having him just to give her a little bit of time to wind down because she's back at work full time so just to give her a little bit of you know alone time or rough time or whatever, she needs so that transitions been a little difficult but we'll get through it."
177.0,Provider,yeah he is he's the child's father is he involved and see after.
3266.0,Patient,"they're married. Great yeah and he's really, really good my. So me my husband my daughter, and his side of the family and then my son we're very spiritual and so she met him at the church and so. You know I mean, of course, things can always go sour but you know, thankfully he's a he's really good family, so you know everybody's really good and his parents, a lot of times we'll watch the baby, so that the baby doesn't have to physically go into daycare. And then he's not with strangers so. huh. yeah so. But. I was going to talk to you about something something that's been weighing heavy on me for a little while. So you know the trouble that i've been going through with my mom. Or, and I have had like a I don't know on a strange relationship for quite some time. I feel like when I moved to new Mexico like I moved back to new Mexico to try to like be more with my family and like be really supportive cuz my sister had a baby that was born with a lot of medical issues. And so we all kind of like move together, just to kind of help her and I took on my nephew I would pick him up every Thursday and then I would take him home every Sunday just to give my sister that break. And so I haven't seen my mom now and probably a year ago. And she lives here in Rio rancho and. Like it's not it's not. That I miss the relationship I just I have. there's something that like I don't know like holding over me as to like if something were to happen to her, you know how would I even know about it, you know what I mean and i'm trying to be like the bigger person and. I don't know like just suck it up and maybe just go over cuz she moved into a different place. And so maybe just go over there and talk to her, but it just feels like every time I do that something else opens up and then I have to deal with that issue for months, you know, so I don't know it's it's definitely been tough lately."
177.0,Provider,"So, would you say that when you try and make that attempt to visit her it's like, then you spend much time over here from the impacts of whatever happened during that visit. So what if there were different barriers that can be put in place to give you that sense of connection or like checking in with your mom but still doesn't have to want such an extensive period of opinion, could you maybe just do like a phone call instead of going to visit her in person."
3266.0,Patient,"Well, I know that would be you know okay to the last time I sent her a text message, just to find out because my sister had. had talked to me and said that there were some things going on with my step dad which for the most part he's more or less my dad because I mean my real dad he died recently and we didn't have a whole lot of connection I mean it definitely affected me but. it's not the type of effect when like a really, really close loved one were to pass. You know what I mean. So I didn't. have a lot of like emotions and connections with him, but that was like what he chose when we were younger so. When I tried to reach out to my mom the last time she had responded in a text message, almost as if I was a friend and she was relaying a message to me. So it's like talking to me, and a third person well my kids don't care about us and we're going to be moving and my kids just really don't care and as if I was not a kid you know. relationship yeah so, and you know after I got that text message I turned and I just you know I thought to myself for just a minute, maybe i'm just overreacting and then I gave the phone my husband and I was like just tell me what you think about that response. And he was like it seems to me like she's talking to a friend door, not even talking to her daughter. And that's like my biggest issue is that me and my husband, have always been there for her she's moved I can't even tell you how many times, I mean when we were kids growing up everybody used to think we were in the military because we move so much. yeah and so she's moved a lot. Probably about six months ago. When vinson my husband and I and the kids were younger we used to take a bunch of different family photos at different seasons well she mailed all of those photos back to me. of her grandkids of me of my husband. And I don't know what. Think about that."
177.0,Provider,"Well, that there's a separation, which she did that's on her side of the street. And though it impacts you that's not for you to take on to our lives and figure out what did you do wrong for her to respond in that way. And I know it feels uncomfortable that you have a lover that's alive, you have not seen her for a year, but it sounds like there's been a repetition of mom just not treating me well, and you had to put up boundaries. And maybe those boundaries weren't expressed to her, but there were boundaries that she put up maybe unintentionally, and you have this piece, but because you're also for one that's responsible that you also feel this responsibility to be a present for your mom. And that's understandable but. Your your relationship with your mom may require me to be a little bit more to think differently, as opposed to traditional way of what a mother daughter relationship and look like. So the way you show your responsibility because that's one of your core values is it may look different it may just have to be limited to phone calls or, if you do in person visits you put like a timer on. Like I gave myself Max 30 minutes, just to lay eyes on her see her well beans intact. And then i'm making an excuse, I go. You know. compacted in a way, where it forces you that even if you want to stay longer it forces you to leave just for the sake of not compromising these boundaries that you put in place to protect your peace."
3266.0,Patient,"yeah yeah it's just hard because i'm like I never really allowed any of this stuff to like really affect me and. You know now that my daughter has had a baby she talks to me a lot and she's like mom you know. I don't know how you go the way you do it, you know, working on going to school and then you know you were there for because I stayed in the room, with her the whole time she was in Labor. And then you know I went to her place and I made sure the House looks cleaned and sterilized and everything because we're bringing a baby home and coded you know. Just kind of like really freaking out about that, but then you know my daughter just sitting there and asking me she's like to do have that when you were going through all that."
177.0,Provider,And I went no.
3266.0,Patient,"I didn't have it, you know so it's Nice that you're able to have a husband, that is there for you to support you, while you're there during childbirth, you know, bringing a child into the world. And then you also have a mom and a dad that I am We obviously care about you, because we're there for you every step of the way you know, whatever my kids need we set boundaries for them and they're very responsible they both work their butts off. You know they take care of their bills and just I mean really, really blessed with really good kids. But just heard you know, asking me these questions about you know what my childhood was like it's just at times, I just want to. Like secure her from knowing a lot of the stuff that I went through because I don't want her to. doesn't really need to know it all, you know my kids have never really had a really good relationship with my mom because my mom is always put me and my kids or even like my older sisters kids to the back. So as soon as she got married to john which they've been married, since I was very. They ended up having a kid he's got a boy, so they have a son together but he's older. And they do everything for him, they bought his house for him any trust that he's ever wanted they bought a truck for him, you go to my mom's House and you look on my mom's refrigerator and my mom has his kids on the roof, on her refrigerator and nobody else's. One year for Christmas she gave my daughter back the presence that my daughter gave her the year before. And so it's just little stuff that you know hit me and i'm i'm not really like emotional about it because I feel like i've already gotten to the. Point where i've allowed myself to become numb because i've cried and cried and cried and told myself, you know I don't know what you expect from me yeah don't ask her for anything. I don't go to her for any issues any problems my husband and I both work. You know we're not into hard drugs and alcohol there's not commotion going on, we literally go to work go home go to church go home. there's nothing in between, and so I don't know what she wants from us, the only thing I could tell my husband is if I were to ever win the lottery, if I were to go to her house, she would welcome me with open arms, and then in that same conversation, she would ask me for money. So I don't know I don't know how to feel about any of it yeah."
177.0,Provider,"And that that was gonna be my follow up question you mentioned done the work to get some point where you're not as emotional you feel numb. But I think the more helpful emotional will be peace, because what i'm hearing is even though you protect yourself from villain extreme emotional distress you still don't have peace about. where you are in your relationship with your mom and I think that when you recognize that what you've done has held value in having boundaries and despite of all the boundary violations that your mom has done you've been able to be in a position to be a good mother to your children. And so it tells me just like some of the behaviors that you've mentioned about mom is that she has her own things that she needs some path, maybe from her childhood. And because a lot of this stuff is like really is on our side of the street and being a child and how old you get that still your mother so it's hard not to be impacted by what she's done yeah."
3266.0,Patient,"it's just weird stuff I mean I asked my husband's mom all the time, would you ever send like your son's pictures back to him. You know, we spend money to have these done so that you guys have them, but we would have my husband's family House and our wedding picture is right there as soon as you walk in the front door I can't or on their refrigerator. You know it's just little things and I mean maybe it's still minor than I shouldn't allow it to affect me as much but that's just like one piece of the pie."
177.0,Provider,And it's not just me.
3266.0,Patient,"it's it's a big deal because I used to be really, really close to my mom anytime he had surgery, I would take off. If she moved I would work all day stay up all night to help them move, I would go back to their house help them unpack. i've stayed up late night painting and. Taking her to different stores i've taken her out to breakfast and done pedicures, and I mean I could just go on and on and on about different you know the times that we did have that were they were good times, but those good times still don't. Give me the sense of relief, just to walk over to her and go hey mom like how are you doing because there's always something else that comes about. You know, while you haven't been around for a year, so. How would you know what's going on, you know it's this stuff like that, instead of just. I don't know allowing me to come over and just allow things to be as they are, you know getting the met a new grandbaby yeah. So I don't know."
177.0,Provider,"Are we share those experiences that you sell me my mom had a good relationship, maybe i'm missing something, but all those experiences shared you were serving her. You were like in a care taking roll. It wasn't like we had this great conversation we had a laugh or we were drinking coffee we watched a favorite show, like all of those experiences that you shared with me, you were in that care taking wrong. So, as long as you were doing something for her. Then she was happy."
3266.0,Patient,"yeah and it's so funny too because. i've always wanted to be in the medical field always and. We struggled I mean my husband had multiple surgeries he has severe rheumatoid rheumatoid arthritis. he's been a lot of pain all the time. His body can't tolerate any type of opiates he goes into like. I don't know like a shock syndrome not like anaphylaxis but his body just kind of shuts down and he becomes very fatigued very fragile can't really do much of anything. So they're trying to see if they could do a bunch of different like injectables on them like human error or something like that to help with the pain and so. I don't know just you know all the things that you know him and I have been through. And then just not I don't know like they've never been there for me when we him and I have struggled my brother got or half brother got married to. his girlfriend or whatever what used to be my kids babysitter. And I graduated medical assisting school and then wanted to go into nursing school right away, well, I couldn't because I had my kid I had to worry about daycare and. I just couldn't afford to do school full time and not have an income, so I had to put it on the side well, they have kids to my mom paid for her schooling and her transportation to and from for her to get her nursing degree and i've had to struggle to get mine. I don't know yeah."
177.0,Provider,"The challenges, when you put yourself of trying to understand why she do what she did you continue to wrestle with confusion. And I think when you started to realize my unbeknownst to you that I want to be her daughter don't want to be in this caretaking capacity. yeah that's when that distance started creating you look up and you're like whoa it's been a year. And you see that as a detriment, but to me that shows you positioning yourself of all, I wanna I want to represent a new role in my mother's life. And i'm i'm uncertain that even when you go to check in if she has the capacity, me you see that there's been different experiences when she she says she's not willing, but I think she's not willing, because, for whatever reason she does not have the capacity. To see when that mine."
3266.0,Patient,"I don't know man my sisters, have always you know talk just amongst ourselves just saying you know, when will we ever be. good enough for her you know when our kids ever going to be good enough, and then I just got to the point where i'm like Why do I have to try to be good enough. You know I struggled with that, for many, many years going through you know, an abusive childhood and you know everything else that i've gone through with one of her brothers. And just now, having at 48 going to be 49 just having that peace in my mind to know that. Honestly, if she were to pass tomorrow, I honestly feel like I would be okay, I mean I don't want to see her go, but we don't have that relationship that I desired so many years ago, you know I just allowed myself to just you know. I don't know, at times, but we used to always say that I was the adopted one because my sisters used to get in all kinds of trouble, and I was just the good child I always make sure I had good grades, then. I did chores when I was supposed to, and you know I didn't sneak out of the House I didn't go to late night parties I didn't do any of that, but just bad things happened and I left home at 14 and I never turned back, and I think because of that i've allowed myself to become. more of an adult to consume everything. And then, just over the last couple of years, I think, with just being able to talk about it more to somebody that doesn't really know me nor her and just to listen and be able to. Continually be able to say what happened to me as a child. But allow it, not to affect me as bad as it did before."
177.0,Provider,"yourself to move through the pains, and that you can heal and then you know, often people said well if this person passed, you know I want to have on the ground where I could have done, and my thoughts regarding your your mother in the diamond because you know I heard in days. she's going to come to the realization that she missed out on a great opportunity to have a good relationship. yeah so it's not you that necessarily has to have this Void or fill this regret about creating the boundary. She is going to miss out when she's already missing out on an opportunity to be a part of a loving supportive family, I mean. The value and the consistency that you've been for several Members of your family it's not just limited to your daughter was your sister was your nephews your mom like all of those attributes who would not want that. And the evidence that supports that there are some faulty thinking on your mom's path is that if she does not want that. Then, maybe that's that signal for you up hey I really do need to be consistently creating and maintaining my boundaries."
3266.0,Patient,"yeah. And I think the hard part two, is that because of my brother and witches witches my step dad son i'm. Like he's a police officer for San Diego county, which is where we live. About 10 years ago my step dad had had open heart surgery. And the doctor had came out and we were all sitting in the lobby and the doctor said, you know I think this would be a really good time for you all to donate blood. And so me and my sisters were gung Ho you know we were just going to go donate blood and he was like wait a minute, and he turned into looked at the doctor and he goes well, I don't know why their blood would make a difference because they're not even his kids. And, unlike well, I mean okay like if you really want the whole public to know that we're not his kid then. Really, maybe we aren't maybe we're not posed to be who we thought we were all these years, you know we were in the picture way before my half brother, but you know so that's affected us to like my sisters and I talked about it all the time, you know, but I don't know. Like I try not to get like really emotional or think about you know the past so much because. The life that I have now like, I have a really amazing husband and my kids are really good everybody's healthy. And even though my job works me to death. I love where i'm at you know I love the patients that I take care of and you know, at times, it is hard, and you know i've struggled but. I don't think I could have it any other way, like i'm finally at a point in my life, where no matter which direction I turn. there's no turn that I could turn where I would have a frown because every part of me is thankful for the life that I have you know."
177.0,Provider,"But even when you have several areas where we have opportunities to be gratitude gratitude doesn't have to discount sorrow, so you can still have those moments where you're like it's a shame. That my mom doesn't value me. it's a shame that that narrative was played that I mean he had to be fed that narrative to verbalize that. Where did that come from How does that fields, when you feel comfortable to say something like that yeah."
3266.0,Patient,"I don't. We talk about it a lot. Like I said it is what it is, so I try not to allow it to affect me that much. it's just another hateful something that has come about whether it became my step dad or my mom. You know, when you try to just avoid the situation because no matter how good do try to make it, it still ends up bad and there's really no point in trying, you know, like i've called her and texted her and I talked about my step dad and how he's been feeling."
177.0,Provider,and
3266.0,Patient,"I just get talked to us if i'm the next door neighbor so. You know, maybe it's just time just delete things the way they are, and when she's ready to make ends meet, and you know allow herself to be the mom that she needed to be so many years ago, maybe the door will still be open, I don't know. I don't know."
177.0,Provider,"Because I know you value me and responsible, you know who may consider what you can do as a gesture of showing i've done what I needed to do right if it's something that to buy a drop off once a month we'll have to really engage, but you drop off just to show like this is what i'm doing. it's just something to think of it's not a suggestion to do it. But i'm getting the impression that there's the starting to that feel like there's something you should be doing on your end and there is, I want to honor that. So I want you to protect."
3266.0,Patient,"yeah and you know that's something that my husband said, because the other day we were shopping and we normally get. Different Christmas cards for like his mom and my mom and different than you know what we would do for like aunts and uncles or just read you know our friends and so he was like well, maybe we should just go ahead and send your parents of cards this year and i'm like. yeah sure. So I don't know, maybe i'll start off at that and see what that you know kind of about. I don't know."
177.0,Provider,"If you choose not to that's Okay, too. yeah I will just. suggest that if you plan to visit her that you should really make sure that you are intentional about giving yourself a time frame. So they can get out of there. Because you know, trying to continue the path and then expect that she's going to give a different result there hasn't really been a new evidence to support the she will change."
3266.0,Patient,"yeah. I mean, other than that, like like I said, things have been good, I mean definitely been kind of crazy with work and school, but I mean it keeps me motivated and you know just being. Well disciplined and just really driven to finally get this chapter of my life done with, and you know we'll we'll see where my nursing degree takes me I don't I you know I I don't really want to leave where i'm at now, but you know if they would happen."
177.0,Provider,"yeah there's lots of opportunities in your path and it's just a matter of what you want to do um and then I think to what brings you kind of like thinking about just all these little transitions is when have a grandchild It makes you see life in a different way. Because now, this is a new generation it's being created, and so legacy what footprint, do you want to leave and his memories of what family looks like and you get to create and copy those values William do your actions that narrative does not have to include your experience."
3266.0,Patient,yeah yeah. yeah.
177.0,Provider,"And it may be helpful to process that when your daughter is to bring her into that and to remind her that how you've come to a place of you know your resiliency and why do you value family so much because yeah you had a position where you didn't feel about it. And so, rather than going through a destructive path to creating a new generation of. Not feeling valued you chose the other side."
3266.0,Patient,"yeah that's a good idea. And Florida, and I got her very smart she just turned 28. She very smart. she's a good girl."
177.0,Provider,"You have to go back into work, or you."
3266.0,Patient,Know i'm done for the day I actually get to go home and actually get to relax and yeah not going to do much of anything.
177.0,Provider,"Good good for you, it was so nice seeing you being able to catch up. i'm just wondering if. Something had come up with your mom. yeah."
3266.0,Patient,"But it's okay i'll get through it i'll get past that I always do i'll figure something out and then we'll go from there, and the next time we talk, will be able to that it."
177.0,Provider,"was on the forefront of your mind, maybe what you should get next steps look like."
3266.0,Patient,"i'm i'm just going to send him probably a basket or something for Christmas, and you know just. Put a little note inside there she's got my number and i'm just going to tell her you know I love you and I miss you and Merry Christmas happy holidays, you have my number, if you ever want to talk so just leave it at that and see what happens."
177.0,Provider,Good I think it's the best way to navigate that.
3266.0,Patient,That.
177.0,Provider,"That difficult, complex relationship that you know that happens, but it's really you know something that she has to work through and you're out of the shower that that's not within your power source what's in your parents let you can do. So."
3266.0,Patient,yeah right.
177.0,Provider,yeah you have any lingering thoughts or questions before you.
3266.0,Patient,"Know good, how are your kids doing."
177.0,Provider,"they're doing good doing good I was actually thinking about a conversation I have with my son and a car today, when I was talking to you about how we can kind of. Give kids a glimpse of what our experiences were like and show them, you know, a different story so. I I knew I wanted to pick up my kids from school I didn't want them to ride the school bus, because in middle school, I had to catch the bus and because my school so far, there was a period of time, where the bus what it should work. Summer missing school and getting anxious about it my. Parents will be working they couldn't leave work to take me and eventually they advocated to the school and they fix the situation and I was. picked up from the bus, but I don't remember any positive memories from writing the school bus I remember thinking of wanting to be a good student of what situations at school, but then you get on the bus and now there's new dynamic. yeah i'll try to not get in trouble with the boss. So I told them that they have a job that I have flexibility and i'm not confined to a can't leave work like I can pick the other children and they don't have to take the bus. And you know my boys, they were willing to listen to that, and they were like wow you know, and I thought i'm not making it seem as though my parents were wrong but i'm sharing why I value so much picking them right. yeah no that's some context to of how you share those things with your daughter that's yeah necessarily shaming your childhood, but it's helped me her to see why you do certain things the way you do."
3266.0,Patient,Right right. yeah.
177.0,Provider,"And it was so solid insignificant, but I thought wow like those move things have an impact. And that's why i'm doing things that I do now."
3266.0,Patient,"that's right that's right. All right, my dear well you. Good catching up and I will see you, week after next."
177.0,Provider,"Yes, yeah take care of the baby for me."
3266.0,Patient,I will.
