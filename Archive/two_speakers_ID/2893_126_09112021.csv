126.0,Provider,yeah a lot of people.
2893.0,Patient,"weird I never I always wondered what the difference was because some people in group would take tablets, and then I didn't know until I got pregnant and I always wondered what what the difference was. But I guess that."

2893.0,Patient,that's what usually starts it.
126.0,Provider,"Exactly that's. Just like a no go can't can't. I would. toothpaste on my finger and kind of rubbing on my teeth and just because, like sticking the toothbrush in my mouse would automatically just cause a gag reflex."
2893.0,Patient,"that's where i'm at, and so I like i'll take my medication first and then let it dissolve and then whatever i'll brush my teeth and i'm like don't throw up don't throw up. it's just grow I can't muffins anymore, yesterday I ate English muffin with my favorite like white cheese on it anyways I ate it. One minute later it was coming back up So can I. had to take a break from peanut butter and jelly is because those came right back to."

126.0,Provider,mm hmm.
2893.0,Patient,But other than that. Nothing yet really.
126.0,Provider,Good good yeah. smelling the. color kind of work overtime.
2893.0,Patient,"it's coming anytime I smell, something that does not sit well i'm just like when I smell. or cigarette smoke, or like food that stinks or yeah and i've noticed this is a really weird when like dishes like if they're not if they're in the sink and they still have a little bit of food on him like this sight."
126.0,Provider,God.
2893.0,Patient,I don't know it's weird.

126.0,Provider,That was the best thing to me it was like.
2893.0,Patient,weird little cramps and then they feel like period cramps but they're not and then that makes makes you realize like oh yeah i'm not that's not period.
126.0,Provider,"Right right there's there's a baby in there, moving around. yeah in my my smell sense of smell just went into overtime and I would cut into people's houses and I would walk in I go you guys have broccoli yeah a week ago. You know I smell something from or my mom take me out to lunch and after a while she knew to just like walk into the restaurant first and I had to smell. Because half the restaurant smelled. Yes, though nasty."
2893.0,Patient,"If I weren't Mel Curry right now, like. I would yeah."
126.0,Provider,"yeah so it'd be so funny because she'd want to take me out at least once a week, and I say you know I know like what restaurant, do you want to go to I don't know it just depends, how it smells. yeah because it was two or three."
2893.0,Patient,days in there and it's like magnified.
126.0,Provider,"Yes. And and i'm a person I have allergies and I used to couldn't smell anything but my nose became alive, when I was pregnant."
2893.0,Patient,it's weird.
126.0,Provider,it's weird.
2893.0,Patient,Some days i'm like wow i'm in an Internet and then I really think about it and i'm like. that's weird.
126.0,Provider,"And and and the thing is it's it's going to keep changing as you go along there's going to be weird that it, you know, after a while after like well when you're in your about your fourth month you'll probably be able to eat, most of the future, you."
2893.0,Patient,"wow. I am hoping, I can only really I usually can only eat dinner good like I can eat a lot and not be sick usually but during the whole day I just i'm hungry, but I everything I throw up I just literally eat salting crackers yogurt. or sit like or soup. Or you know. Like that's all I have."
126.0,Provider,yeah.
2893.0,Patient,And then at nighttime I can eat anything. it's weird.
126.0,Provider,"So no that's great that you know your morning sickness is more apt in the morning, in the early your get up. you're catching that morning sickness right there so that that does make sense."
2893.0,Patient,yeah.
126.0,Provider,it's so exciting.
2893.0,Patient,"It is there's a lot of i'm I am really excited there's a lot of things that need to change soon, so I can actually take it in and enjoy it and be excited, but I am. I have to find figure out what i'm gonna do with my grandma and find some more vertigo and she's getting worse and being pregnant, I cannot take care of her. And self and a baby."
126.0,Provider,Right no that's.
2893.0,Patient,None of my selfish they don't care they don't want her.
126.0,Provider,so sad but yeah. You need to protect yourself make healthy boundaries and yeah that's a tough job to be pregnant and taking care of somebody that you've.
2893.0,Patient,"grown ties toddler. yeah it's it's yeah it's pretty much to that point. And I just cannot do it, and I just get frustrated all the time, and I feel bad though i'm always stressed out and it is just."
126.0,Provider,How long has she been living there.
2893.0,Patient,"Like three years. But yeah and then those three years she's just declined so much and it's like she's got to go somewhere, you know my cousin who doesn't even have a house is applying for apartments you know, so you can take her and it's like you know how long that date."
126.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
2893.0,Patient,"But i'm going to give in the. New this. I said something's got to give in the meantime, because I cannot do it for much longer, like it's hard for us to be. Like enjoy being a couple and being pregnant and try it, you know when it's just constantly having to take care of her."
126.0,Provider,After working yeah. So now does she collect social security.
2893.0,Patient,"yeah and she has to she makes too much to have in home supportive services so they're actually being aid. But probably not enough for an Assisted Living or just close enough but they're never have any openings like it's we're gonna have to start just putting applying for the helium to hear but we're gonna have to start applying for them, but."
126.0,Provider,"i'm hoping to put your name on the waitlist. Because somebody's going to die and lot of these places, will take whatever social security, the person has."
2893.0,Patient,"yeah that's true we it's she needs to be not like in a nursing home, but like assisted."
126.0,Provider,"Living right The difference is she needs someone to feed her cook for her clean, for her shower her."
2893.0,Patient,make her food give her her medication.
126.0,Provider,That that's Assisted Living.
2893.0,Patient,yeah that's what she needs. and fallen like three times four times in the last month.
126.0,Provider,Oh no.
2893.0,Patient,"yeah she's fine every time she all she somehow falls perfectly I don't. I don't know she just like a founder in the parking garage I don't know how long she was in there, she was home alone and that's The thing is it's scary to leave him alone, you know. And I found her on the garage floor she said she was only down there for 20 minutes."
126.0,Provider,"10 minutes, but how does she. know she has no idea."
2893.0,Patient,"No, she has no fucking clue she's you know what day it is. So i'm like I have no idea how long she was just sitting on the ground floor my garage floors concrete. yeah. you're fine and then she fell. In her bedroom after she took a shower she went to send her bed just missed and then woke us up in the middle, the night one night just sitting on her force somehow fell out of bed or miss that so it's like she's not falling far but she's just falling right on her bed, and she can't. get it. And if i'm home alone I can't get her up."
126.0,Provider,"You know, no, no."
2893.0,Patient,"it's just crazy too much to deal with, and I feel really have not been able to enjoy my pregnancies, as long as to take care of her."
126.0,Provider,"Well, and they're gonna have to let go with the guilt feelings about feeling bad."
2893.0,Patient,Because I gave up on that knowing care of her for three years.
126.0,Provider,you've done your part. And you know you didn't you didn't agree to keep her for the rest of your life and.
2893.0,Patient,"I did not, I was supposed to disappoint you are not capable to continue taking care of her. If and that's the thing, so my cousin has added her. To her apartment application so, hopefully with her income and everything and will help but it's like Okay, what are you going to do, you might have her for another year, but then you're definitely going to have to put her somewhere yeah yeah. And my cousin i'm like you know what you're taking on right like that's you know what you're about to be having to do right and you can't just leave her home alone and. So we'll see. it's just sad my mom or my uncle like none of them are even trying to help they're not trying to take her my mom's like take her to your uncle's it's like they're just stupid. wow so selfish."
126.0,Provider,That is so cold blooded.
2893.0,Patient,"Oh, she she didn't really raised my mom but she raised my uncle until he was literally 40 and all six of his fucking kids and he's the one that paper and he wants nothing he doesn't want it. yeah it's just a shit show, but she did a lot for my mom was my mom had kids she did a lot for me so it's like yeah mom you're still entitled you still should help her."
126.0,Provider,"Yes, exactly and guess what your mom wouldn't be here without her."
2893.0,Patient,"i'm like it's just it's crazy there's so much to it come on sorry my cat scratching. Is it like right now she's gone, which is nice my cousin has been trying to take her and get her out of the House because i'm at work all day I can't I don't have anywhere to take very she just sit here all day by herself, which also isn't helping."
126.0,Provider,"No, not at all there's no social."
2893.0,Patient,"interaction oh yeah, and that makes me feel bad she's just bored she fully hasn't she does not understand COPA whatsoever, she doesn't understand why I can't take her walmart why can't take her. We go to my uncle's House like every weekend so she can get out and see all the kids and put you know hang out whatever but it's like she doesn't understand why she we can't just up and run to walmart and play around and walmart do all the stuff because. If she were to get club at you die flat out she worst asthma ever."
126.0,Provider,"yeah. yeah i'm didn't understand that either she would. She would all during coven she'd say Oh, she would call me let's go out to mom we can't go out to lunch. yeah sushi we can't mom we can't go in there. She did not understand either."
2893.0,Patient,And I don't want I don't like she thinks i'm just like keep holding her hostage and don't want to take her anywhere.
126.0,Provider,Right exactly.
2893.0,Patient,"it's just a lot and that's all like that's where 95% of my stress comes from. And the other one is like when she goes that's her portion of rent going that's her other bill to going, you know so it's like all of that, at once, and then having a baby so it's just so crazy."
126.0,Provider,yeah yeah So do you think you and your boyfriend on your own will be able to pay the rent and all that stuff or is it going to.
2893.0,Patient,"lead us to this is our fourth house, but this is our nicest most expensive house. You know, and they just raised our rent so I mean we could do it, but we would be broke. You know i'm gonna look for a better job so you can get something that pays more than."
126.0,Provider,What.
2893.0,Patient,"I was going to look for like other houses, because we don't have to stay here but there's no. houses in this town so it's just hard."
126.0,Provider,gonna have to start really crescent city right.
2893.0,Patient,"yeah we're going to really hurt learning how to save and penny pinch, and all that."
126.0,Provider,"yeah it's a shame, when you have to pay like you know more than half your paycheck on rent."
2893.0,Patient,"rent is 1350. Plus power, plus cable plus water plus phone. nothing's included, but trash."
126.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
2893.0,Patient,So it's just a lot. Can can't I would I would rather have to figure that out and try to do all of it at once and taking care of her you know. yeah hopefully.
126.0,Provider,"Well, and you know you can also call they have these like senior advisors that people that you can call. That give you referrals and references and information about senior living places that could be matched up to your mom."
2893.0,Patient,"that's a good idea, because we, I mean I work at this I work literally I sit next to I just says adult protective services and I just said that like I literally sit right next to them. Many cow to be on to be eligible for he says, you have to be a medical she's over income from an account so it's just. That, in general, trying to get her on that so she could have a care provider or show somebody could get paid to take care of her you know."
126.0,Provider,Like you can't get her on that type of Program.
2893.0,Patient,she's like. $300 over.
126.0,Provider,wow.
2893.0,Patient,"What we could do. If it worked was we'd have to go to social security, ask them to change it from survivors to disability, but then that could potentially hurt the price, like the amount that she gets. And then, if she was disabled, we could put her on it, because she'd go on the working disabled program where all she has to do is say she waters, a plan or take the trash out or something. Right and then she would be eligible for that, but the problem there is or social security office has never opened it's all over the phone and that would probably less than the amount that she gets so it's just a big show. yeah. yeah because she's already been where she can't work physically and mentally incapacitated by her doctor, so I didn't go. to social security and see what they would do, but then I don't want to risk like she makes a good amount normal normally people only get anywhere from 900 to 1300 and she gets."
126.0,Provider,She gets what. 17 oh wow.
2893.0,Patient,Which is high and it's my dad my grandpa died it's his social security so. I J it probably wouldn't be that much.
126.0,Provider,yeah. But it just just if going to find out about it.
2893.0,Patient,doesn't mean you.
126.0,Provider,"have to change, I mean, even if they tell you well, she would get blah blah mount on disability, as opposed to blah blah mount on social security that doesn't mean you have to sign the paperwork to go and do it."
2893.0,Patient,that's true that's true.
126.0,Provider,"You can just find out the information, and if that is the fact that if she makes 14 or 15 on disability and that makes her eligible for medicare well then that's what you."
2893.0,Patient,"would fit because she barely has. yeah yeah that's a good point. Definitely, a good point."
126.0,Provider,"But I know, with all the social security office is closed, I was trying. Oh, my God, I went to three different social security offices during the summer."
2893.0,Patient,We only have one.
126.0,Provider,"Oh well, between my route from from my house to work there's three."
2893.0,Patient,wow.
126.0,Provider,"I was in oaks there's one of them turn there's one and OPS our. aim, all three of them, and they were all closed and I needed when I needed something for them to sign off on. I can't remember it was so freaking frustrating, and then the signs on the door like okay just go online, for whatever problem you need well I need them to sign something for me."
2893.0,Patient,hey are you going to get that done online.
126.0,Provider,I don't think getting online is going to help.
2893.0,Patient,It well.
126.0,Provider,It was ridiculous.
2893.0,Patient,"or no yesterday, yesterday I her wallet is gone it's lost but it's in that has her ID her social security card everything we would need for social security. Everything my cousin needed today to put her on her application and they're gone because she lost her wallet I know it has to be in in her mess of a bedroom somewhere, but i've already. Had Oh, and also heard of the card."
126.0,Provider,"Oh, my God."
2893.0,Patient,"I have looked everywhere, and I cannot find it. i'm gonna have to but i've only been able to look a little bit because i've been at work and stuff so like tonight or tomorrow, I will tear."
126.0,Provider,Is she not going to be home for the weekend.
2893.0,Patient,"Now she well. Oh, but at least I won't have to go to work, so I have time to tear it apart and put back together."
126.0,Provider,yeah oh my God.
2893.0,Patient,"we're supposed to she's gonna be gone all day tomorrow but i'm supposed to be there, too, but I want her to go and spend the whole day there and be out of the House and i'm only going to go half a day."
126.0,Provider,Oh good good yeah. Exactly and you deserve it and you know.
2893.0,Patient,"My family looked at me like I was horrible when I told them that last weekend. Literally I said i'm going to leave we're here for an hour and great and they were like Okay, but the way they were frickin looking at me and talking to me they're they're selfish."
126.0,Provider,"Okay, well, maybe you might want to just worded another way and just say I have errands to run i'll back later. Rather than. You know. I need a break from her. You know what I mean. I got. errands to run don't ask you where i'm going. You know."
2893.0,Patient,Last weekend I said I need a break i'm going home sick nap she's bored.
126.0,Provider,yeah you're allowed to do that there's no reason why you shouldn't be able to do that.
2893.0,Patient,"yeah and then my aunt wrote me later it's like she's ready, I would have her stay, but I don't think I could get her upstairs they bought a fucking house, they have three extra bedrooms yeah."
126.0,Provider,But you're all upstairs.
2893.0,Patient,yeah except for that they have a ginormous couch she would have been just fine on. Not that I would ever wonder sleep on the couch when i'm saying they just said that because they didn't want to deal with it. Right right through this.
126.0,Provider,Is.
2893.0,Patient,"Trying to realize like I can't just hate them all, because I."
126.0,Provider,know.
2893.0,Patient,So.
126.0,Provider,This is pretty normal there's usually always one kid out of the bunch that takes the responsibility.
2893.0,Patient,"i'm the only one that works, the only one, with my own House my own everything they all don't none of them work, none of them. And that's insane. yeah I mean my aunt my uncle work, but all of his daughters that should be taking care of her none of them work. One have. One has four kids she has a really, really ghetto apartment but she's on welfare so welfare pays for it."
126.0,Provider,I understand.
2893.0,Patient,For kids and she would help more if she could okay I kind of get that.
126.0,Provider,"Okay, for kids that's a good excuse."
2893.0,Patient,"My grandma literally raised her Okay, the other one who my grandma raised her and her baby is a tweak or that lives in the swamps she's the one that got my grandma evicted from her house made her lose her car and end up here with me. yeah she does drugs and lives in the swamps of DEMO account. yeah the other one has a baby lives with her mom and the other one just works nighttime and has the entire day to do whatever it could totally helped me, but she does. And then I have another and more cousins don't get me started, but those are the ones, those are the four that they rate that she and my grandpa raise that should be. Right one Facebook page should be feeling some kind of obligation to. Maybe helps me, but I have to give her gas money every single time and I usually have to like pull teeth to get her to help me. I don't mind giving her gas money but it's like I have to beg her to help me pretty much. I don't know, and I feel like i've been. Really hostile towards old them lately, and I need to tone it down, but I because of the way I feel it's all coming out and they've been asking for help and i've been crying work so now i'm just mad."
126.0,Provider,"Right I, and I know you've been talking about this for a long time, and no one, no one seems to want to."
2893.0,Patient,And it's getting worse now my hormones are through the roof I quit smoking so everything just irritates me.
126.0,Provider,"that's so funny because I just was talking to. Oh, you don't know yo JESSICA. You know just know she's in another group Okay, she is living in a camper with her mom they sleep in the same bed."
2893.0,Patient,Poor girl.
126.0,Provider,"Oh, my God she she says, I would quit smoking, but that's, the only way i'm retaining my senate was."
2893.0,Patient,Put a pillow over her mother she.
126.0,Provider,"said oh so you're smoking you're saying you're smoking is what's helping you keep your mental health, she said yes. Because little there, she has no room of her own she has nowhere to like go to be alone or private."
