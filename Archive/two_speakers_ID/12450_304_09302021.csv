We have court in October, so we're scared how that's gonna go."

12450.0,Patient,"we've been separated for over a year now and. He cannot stand, the fact of another male being. Around so then he tells my son that. You know mom's not supposed to have people around you which isn't true, but you know my a girl doesn't know any different he thinks that i'm going to get arrested and go to jail if there's somebody else here. Or we go to my friend's house or whatever, a male at all, and then Eric instead we'll ask him multiple times countless times, who else was there that was mom around and my son should feel that way."
304.0,Provider,yeah no to me like. interrogated.
12450.0,Patient,"And he's eight it didn't our rules you're not supposed to do that. Right right. And I still haven't received, you know everybody's getting these child tax credits or the stimulus checks and things like that I have not seen one, and you know we've been without milk for five days and. i'm really struggling. I need to find a counselor. i'm still trying really hard."
304.0,Provider,"i'm so sorry Rachel your you have so much that you're dealing with right now and. it's a lot. it's a lot, the financial stress on top of everything else."
12450.0,Patient,"I don't understand you know when I was on pills, or whatever I always found a way always why can't I get by now i'm not doing it, you know."
304.0,Provider,"yeah well in your addiction was driving that and that sort of selfish pursuit of. You know, getting high, no matter the cost. And now you're seeing like you probably did you think that, but you probably did let bill slide or you were behind or you were. You were out of milk or you know it's yeah. So. it's not that it was better than I think you're just now, you have you have all your bills all of your expenses. Are you guys on food stamps."
12450.0,Patient,Or you just know God i'm after a year.
304.0,Provider,Because yeah you should also beginning like for the pandemic with food stamps there's it's it's extra right isn't there an additional.
12450.0,Patient,"yeah like. day because i'm supposed to be getting except for tomorrow, but I just have an A check because of the the kids that are in school or whatever, sometimes they give you the extra and I happen to have 100,000 there today, but you know, of course. I am going to take care of us, but my problem is my step sister My big support I guess you could say. She. she's a very, very, very, very, very unstable. I don't know how to tell her to go the hell away from me, because I cannot continue to carry her issues, or whatever you know she says. we'll just say, for example, she has two boys and I love them with all my heart and they live, not in the greatest of conditions and I don't think that's fair and. they're my stepsister. will sit here she comes she finds a way to come to my house every single day. And she'll sit in my chair and she'll sit there with tears in her eyes and you know she's a big girl she's supposed to be losing weight. yeah whatever she's got some issues with her back she's trying to get disability and. she's got tears in her eyes and says, you know i'm so hungry i'm just waiting for my husband to get paid, so I can go get something to eat, and I said, you know if you actually look in your pantry you could probably cook something you know I don't even have that. Is you know so trying to frustrate me. And yeah Jen with sugarcoat stuff because I don't want her to go and hurt herself or anything crazy because she feels like her, only person, so I feel like there's a lot on me for that. You know what that that emotional you know, relying on me and I can carry my own little bone somebody else but. She. She left here with my link card okay. And I I had $70 where. We were Okay, it was last month and I knew we were all right, for now, and I said, you know, make sure the boys have stuff to eat. Less. Here, with that $70 and instead bought a bunch of junk food, you know, like chicken wings and. gusher errors and stupid stuff that was totally not necessary."
304.0,Provider,"Right, so you gave her."
12450.0,Patient,"I gave her my card to make sure that her voice had food. And she left here and it's a 20 minute drive from me to her, she went to McDonalds with what money they had left in their bank account, to make sure she ate mcdonald's went home grabbed one of her kids told them to walk to the dollar store and use my card and pick up today. So I was very."
304.0,Provider,So oh so you really just had to learn that lesson the hard way do not give her money. When you don't have I mean you you're so giving generous but.
12450.0,Patient,"It puts me in these situations, I see a wall I wouldn't want it to be me but Lo and behold here, I am in that situation, but that's not the point at the time, I could do it, so I wanted to do it. And i've always been that person that I don't want kids to go without because I was one of those kids with my month."
304.0,Provider,"hey Rachel you have kids to in her kids are not. they're not here was the ability, you can get on she could get her own food stamp card."
12450.0,Patient,"They can't qualify because her husband makes too much and that's what frustrates me because he does make enough, they could get by as they would be responsible. But who am I to say you know i'm not in a better position to judge."
304.0,Provider,something you just don't give her money anymore. I think here kids you tell yourself know they have enough money to get by where she could be working. know she could be working to it sounds like there's no reason that she is. yeah.
12450.0,Patient,"I don't wanna I don't want to agree, because you know I could be working that you know what I mean she's in worse shape than I am, you know she had. It she lost some weight she probably wouldn't be struggling as much because she's a heavy girl, but I I don't I do a lot by myself, that I should be doing, you know. So I I wish I could order and I needed to figure something out how. Christmas is coming so soon I i'm really worried about that, and I have yet to get my tech stuff figured out with the irs because somebody is using my social so i'd never get money. And I gotta get that straight note still and it's been a year so trying to trying to get my ducks in a row, but. You know which one comes first, the chicken or the egg I don't want to start."
304.0,Provider,"yeah, but I think you can just start with with some healthier boundaries Rachel and you can you can be there for her, and you can be an emotional support to her, but. I mean you're giving and you're being so kind and generous, but like when you have so little yourself like you needed that $70 on your card."
12450.0,Patient,"Think about it, you know because i'm like we just went shopping it'll be fine you know pri and I was just it was foolish I shouldn't have done it I won't do it ever again. You know I shouldn't have been without milk and I asked if I could borrow money because of my medicine, I was having trouble with the bathroom so I bought an enema. I was that desperate and unconquerable ahead do something, so I asked my step sister and her husband to borrow money so right away, it was can you pay me back up that your check today I need to go get coffee from McDonalds I am drinking a mcdonald's coffee Cup. But it's the same cup every time I just use it, I like I don't like the plastic taste for like those ones you use at home, so I use this one I rent it I use it again. So yeah somebody else is going to see that they Oh, she went bought coffee you don't know you don't know I roll my cigarettes you don't know I do my own nails you know I don't go buy this stuff I do it myself. But I, so I feel like it's it's quick to judge you know I know where the drones really."
304.0,Provider,"And you mentioned to me the constipation issue on Tuesday. yeah and I know, like other women, particularly none of any of our patients, but particularly the women have just mentioned that that's just been such an issue with them on suboxone. yeah. And I.

304.0,Provider,"yeah I don't know about the animals like know if you're in such a bad state, but maybe there there's another over the counter like what's it called like mirella mills effect easier, maybe."
12450.0,Patient,"yeah I can't I can't afford it, so I was trying to go like more natural what I know what I have, how can I pull this off, I was thinking really what I should get as magnesium citrate. Because I know the flush me right out, you know, if anything, it tastes terrible used to be 98 cents at walmart so now that I got my check after I get Sarah from school, I have to pay rent and all my bills whatever's left I. i'm going to try to get you know just a bottle of that and chug it down because I gotta do something i'm so uncomfortable."
