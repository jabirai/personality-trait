221.0,Provider,"yeah Oh, that is fantastic that's great. So I want to share my screen and show you something. i'm going to show you. you're going to be psyched to see this, this is your, this is a have a graph everybody's attendance record they call the attendance record is it's graft out so you can visually see and it's really it's really cool so i'm going to show you yours. Okay, so do you see this."

221.0,Provider,kinda they will see this. kind of.
500.0,Patient,"getting closer yeah Okay, there is."
221.0,Provider,"yeah you can see it okay so So this is the dates, so this is a whole year. Oh no oh wow is right so. You just see at a glance, so the Green is attended all those things where you checked into an appointment, the yellow is. cancelled so, for whatever reason, either you canceled it or Dominique or it was rescheduled or whatever, so that cancels don't really matter it's just rescheduled or whatever, and then the blues are scheduled haven't happened yet so One of those is today. And then Where does this next week's group."
500.0,Patient,So oh.
221.0,Provider,So the things that we really look for is the reds so.
500.0,Patient,"You have one red, which is a no show when some people yeah what."
221.0,Provider,"Some people have like reds all throughout here mixed in you've got this one red and you got a bunch of Greens they'll you know, the last two I told them to mark them as cancelled. You know, they could have their initially showed up."
500.0,Patient,As I read as a no show.
221.0,Provider,"But I asked them to change it to a canceled because you were had all those hardships, I did not want to mess up your good streak so."
500.0,Patient,So we change those two cancels and so really the last no show you had was.
221.0,Provider,Back in that was at the beginning of the year. yeah it was like it was like end of December beginning of January.
500.0,Patient,Oh wow.
221.0,Provider,yeah so look at this Miranda. I mean that is.
500.0,Patient,awesome wow yeah.
221.0,Provider,"it's really good, so I look at that and it's like Oh, this is a person even I mean just looking at this graph, this is a person who is doing the program who is attending everything and who's doing great. Nice, it is nice."
500.0,Patient,I knew I was on a good streak because I was just telling my husband like.
221.0,Provider,You have.
500.0,Patient,something good to tell me.
221.0,Provider,"I do, and I, and I did you know, last week, too, but. You know, I think that you've been and and really so. One of the things that that kept me from having this conversation with you is that is that you hadn't done your your entire screen in six months, so. I really have to. In order to advance in the prescribing. So to go from a one week prescription to a two week prescription, you have to like have everything you have to have your urine drug screen up today after your surveys up to date, you have to have your attendance no you can't have a no show. It has to be for like 16 weeks straight so that's four months. And so that's why you know you haven't had a no show in well over four months. back and I had all those other things that you still had to catch up on. i'm going to stop sharing."
500.0,Patient,All right.
221.0,Provider,"So so but you're there, so you know you did your drug screen and you did all those other things so starting next week i'm going to do a 14 day prescription instead of a seven day prescription. So that just makes it easier you don't have to go out to the pharmacy and stuff like that. you're still welcome to come, every week. And it would be great to see you every week but you're not required to come. till every other week so like your visits could be with your scripts so, but a lot of people who get a two week script they still come in every week, just because of the support and. yeah like group."
500.0,Patient,That helps.
221.0,Provider,"Good so it'd be nice to see you every week, I hope you still come every week. But yeah, but we will. schedule you for every other week starting next week."
500.0,Patient,Okay.
221.0,Provider,But hopefully you'll come every week.
500.0,Patient,yeah i'm wearing like if I will. yeah.
221.0,Provider,"praying that's good. that's good yeah. Because will miss you if you don't. and And so we'll keep doing that every two weeks as long as you keep up to date on your drug screens and you don't have a no show, if you do have a no show, then we have to go back back it up, do you know and then build back up again. OK, but."
500.0,Patient,"So yeah I was scared did last week, I was like no my scripts gonna get cut i've been doing."
221.0,Provider,"That was unfortunate but. You know you you change those two cancelled, so I think I didn't want that to mess up your good streak. And you're on a winning streak."
500.0,Patient,"Yes, I am."
221.0,Provider,yeah you are and i'm really proud of you.
500.0,Patient,Thanks yeah. God misery.
