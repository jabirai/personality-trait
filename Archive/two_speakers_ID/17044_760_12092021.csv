760.0,Provider,"I think if they're going to prescribe medication, they have to talk to you, unfortunately. Okay, so some of the things that we can do together.

17044.0,Patient,"No, this is good, this is good, and I want to also talk about. The problems that I get that I have with like. Communicating with most people you know I want to know where I do wrong that they."
760.0,Provider,What people you mean like people are their.
17044.0,Patient,"Friends family or even when I go out like you. At the mall people like whatever like whatever that I meet want to know, like why they suddenly get mad at me or why what I say that it's only. Changes everything."
760.0,Provider,"Well, if that happens if maybe you could like make a note of that and bring it up on our next session we can talk about that, but just off the top of my head, you know with this short period of time that we've been together so far. It could be something that there could be a cultural difference that that there's not coming together or is. There something."
17044.0,Patient,system or Persians actually.
760.0,Provider,Oh okay well yeah.
17044.0,Patient,"I mean I don't I don't really have problem with natives, much as I have problems with persons."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, well then scratch that one. Then, perhaps it has something to do with the functioning, you know dealing with your mental health symptoms, the the the depression, the borderline everything that you're struggling with is it kind of. What we think about ourselves, or what we think and believe about the world it affects our emotions in either positive or negative waves and then based on that we make behavior choices and one of the behavior choices, as what are the words that are going to come out of my mouth."
17044.0,Patient,that's them that's that's what I struggle with.
760.0,Provider,"That Okay, so we can talk, we can. write some of those examples down try to and then before we get together again the next time remit either if it happens again between now and then write it down the experience what was going on. If it does, if it doesn't try to remember something that happened, and we can kind of talk about it."
17044.0,Patient,"Okay The thing is, I got way better no because based based on the experiences that i've had with people now. I got way better and this going to this live with really helps me. yeah handle people have to know what to say or not when to say you know."
760.0,Provider,"yeah and there's. there's also the liability, the lack of trust, sometimes people say things sometimes i'm not saying this is you, but I know it's possible that sometimes people say things because I want to say something so that I can put up a barrier before you hurt me."
17044.0,Patient,yeah I know.
760.0,Provider,So I don't know if that's just that's just. i'm throwing that out there as.
17044.0,Patient,"yeah I mean, I also want to really set a goal and like do something that I like and get I mean earn money out of this because earning money it really it's another thing after a romantic relationship that it really helps me to. To do just you know just not think about the trash and just do it gives me confidence."
760.0,Provider,"well. First things first when when. When when we humans carry heavy emotions and struggle with you know mental health symptoms to such degree exact so a lot of our energy. And so you know when we get into a process of healing and I know even in therapy, since a very young age, and I get that but I still have to kind of say this because you know healing there's a process to healing. and"
