13892.0,Patient,"I was like do I, I was like singing like Oh, maybe. Like I don't think lowering. The dose would be effective, I don't know."
298.0,Provider,"My concern is that we are getting your serotonin levels up but you're having a reaction of a dose increase so a dose increase can for a time cause this hyper samia, but it should get better like you should be pulling out of it. And the. Other thing is, as you get. Better we may be able to see more if you have low dope for me and I don't know if we've talked about that have we talked about what low don't mean like."
