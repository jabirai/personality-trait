191.0,Provider,"Okay, my to my I have dark circles so don't. don't worry about that I put solar on every day. Alright, so okay So you see how you curfews, and you see how to pour it is so you want to pull it up make certain you sleep is not under there. And usually what I do is I have my court running on the inside of my arm you don't want to make it too tight and you want to pull it all the way around certain okay. All right man, I know it's just like yeah it can be a little commerce them, so can you. Are you able to slip your cuff, because usually the cuff already is one unit like this, so slasher through."
14262.0,Patient,Oh yeah.
191.0,Provider,"And then the Court you want to have down, you want to have it down here and slide it through. And then watch this through tighten it up and pull it all the way around."
14262.0,Patient,"Okay, there we go."
191.0,Provider,"yeah and they pull your Court on the inside of your blood sugar's to be in a way radio yeah very good yeah all right, Dan and your cup should be a little snow, not to lose, and then you just risk and you press the start, but can you just risk sit there for a minute, a second so. i'm know you thought you were getting automatic blood pressure, monitor."
14262.0,Patient,They get the wrong thing I don't know.
191.0,Provider,"Her yeah yeah I thought you were getting to automate see in order for you use the one that you have you need to have a stethoscope. Okay, all right, so you have to so do you have you ever listened to know what a blood pressure cuff. blood pressure, sounds like the first thought, and then the last thought so I probably won't be able to coach you through this is there, do you have, do you know, have a nurse or anybody in your family that can coach you through any of this."
14262.0,Patient,But you know.
191.0,Provider,"yeah he should be able to do a blood pressure, because that's one of the first things they're going to learn to do. Yes, I thought you had automatic cuff so see. The automatic monitors like this and all you do is press a button and it reads it for you."
14262.0,Patient,That was probably the.
191.0,Provider,"didn't know okay. yeah Okay, so the unit that you have is good it's a good one that's the standard, one that you use an office, but when you're trying to do it yourself. it's a little it's a lot more commerce on like up i'm able to check myself using what you got but I don't know if I could coach you through it, because you got to put it in the right place to hear the sounds and all that stuff okay. All right. Do you have a diagnosis of high blood pressure, anything. Alright, so I thought we would check your blood pressure, before we get your. Because I don't have a problem with Star and you on ADHD medicine, I just need to be, but I wanted to get a blood pressure rating, so let me just try to call your doctor again. And maybe they can give me some of those readings, because I was able to reach out to them once before your records and not back from. Dr Garcia I don't have any records back, but I have called a spoken with them, they don't have a diagnosis of ADHD for you okay so."
14262.0,Patient,"No, I was gonna see if, like you can make things easier."
191.0,Provider,"Okay yeah, but if you already have that diagnosis that would be a problem at all, so the other thing we needed to do, do you have any lab results from us, we got to get some layups I need lab results have you gotten a urine drug screen from us yet or anything like that."
14262.0,Patient,"Oh um i've never taken a drug test before my life, so I didn't really know how to do that I did find it, though."
191.0,Provider,"Okay, so all you have to do is call the virtual clinic Okay, so you found the Cup. yeah Okay, all you gotta do is call the virtual clinic okay and they'll walk you through do not open your cup of your package. They will tell you go to the bathroom urinate in a cup whoa your cup up so they can read information off, so we need to get so we need to get we need uds results okay."

It you got a different you got a manual blood pressure cuff, so we couldn't check it okay."
14262.0,Patient,"it's got a fingering here to read it, I don't know if this makes difference."
191.0,Provider,"yeah but you but, but you have to use it with a stethoscope we got to know what you're. Listening for right, but you got to put it on the right place on our to listen for chronic cough sound the start and the last one, and you got to be able to do that, while you're pumping it up and sit and steal ideally you get an automatic one when you're doing it by yourself okay okay."
