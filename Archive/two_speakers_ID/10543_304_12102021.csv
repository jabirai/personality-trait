10543.0,Patient,yeah. Good my life's been flipped upside down no that's for sure.
304.0,Provider,Why what happened.
10543.0,Patient,went from a hotel where we went from a hotel to now we're in the FAA CC shelter out here.
304.0,Provider,But I didn't even know.
10543.0,Patient,"i'm sorry go ahead, well man has been diagnosed with diabetes and they put them on metformin which is really nasty side effects to it. And he told the job about it and was telling them, you know, took all paperwork in and paperwork with side effects and everything and they're like yeah that's shouldn't be a problem you know will work with you. Well, one of the guys was going to point to one of the higher up guys and they noticed that he went to the bathroom twice within one hour and then sets up to the supervisor like well don't you think that's a liability, you should. You should call him in time not accurate ever so the next day he called and fired him so then we fell behind on rent and then. The guy and he was like oh that's a problem i'm a nurse, and you know we'll work together and don't worry about it, I can probably work with you and then honest on the door with a court date. So we went to the Court date and I told the guy was like look he just started another job if you give us a minute like maybe three weeks if that I can have this spot completely up. And I guess the people down in Tennessee where it's based were like whoa because now they they released the eviction thing where they couldn't have it as a coven. They hate doing that, so they were like for anybody up prevention, we don't want to work with we just want to be done. And so we ended up losing our place or whatever, and then we had to go to the hotel for a week because we couldn't get into the FA CC right away because there was no room. And it was either a hotel or the car and thank God his friend came through and paid for a week's worth and then we did a week in the hotel. And now we're in the shelter but it's not a bad shelter, you know it's pretty decent people are kinda nice there you know they genuinely want to help you. Because you get those people where they have a job and they really shouldn't have that job because they either a suck at it or they're just mean and they don't care, but you can tell that these girls actually care and just want to help."
