2847.0,Patient,"yeah and then and then my townhouse fell through because the lady that gave me that voucher she didn't answer a phone they finally got Ahold of her but they put me out and sign back up on the list so yeah This is all happening, the week."

207.0,Provider,i'm talking about.
2847.0,Patient,"i've been trying not to because he's he's just lost his mind, I think I think he's he says, we had a concussion and he makes a reality and real life, like together. Right dreamland and you don't know really that's really happened, or it hasn't and little messed up."
207.0,Provider,hearing me.
2847.0,Patient,"For a week I went this second to the ninth. Day, it was a week, but I had a good time just me and mom oh now. I surprised her, she didn't know it's coming down so she was. It was cool my step dad bought me a ticket for my birthday and then I. got to go down there see my niece which i'm glad because she. didn't remember me. And i've been down there I go down there every year but. She just turned six so. She didn't remember anytime before Hopefully she remembers this time."
207.0,Provider,"Oh, when your mom told you to consider about work."
2847.0,Patient,"work. I mean that's Okay, it just I don't know where i'm going to be living. I don't know how, when I get back and forth to it either so i'm kind of like."
207.0,Provider,A vehicle.
2847.0,Patient,"And then, if it comes it's all coming out fast, I might have to end up at my grandma's house. Which is across town from what i'm seeing now it's like good good 40 minutes."
207.0,Provider,you're very healthy I know you're you're done.
2847.0,Patient,"yeah that's my dad's mom. which I don't want to, but I might not have options because it's coming so fast, I put my stuff in storage were already have stuff in there, so it's not like I didn't do it. So that's where i'm at right now. Well, I haven't one of my friends, which used to be my boss at my last job. Her husband was in a bad motorcycle accident and they took they took like began thinking make it overnight he's made it like a week. or it's been about a week because it was like no maybe almost to the day before I left for that, because I got the call and. I was in their wedding and everything so they're like really close Well he they took out half of school. So you don't even have half a school right now and we don't know if he he did open his eyes, finally, but we don't know if he remembers her even and they have a two year old. So I might have I might go over there that's an option to to go help her why he's gonna be at the hospital for a minute and stay there, but I don't like staying with friends cuz it always ends up you know, I just want to stay with people period. But that's also an option. that's pretty much my bad just so fast everything's happening so fast and."
207.0,Provider,"I think I mean it's happening, maybe, right now, if you look at fast, but. I mean the position you've been in you've been in for a while and I think like at this point it's really human we talked about, and I think I had given this homework. More so the pros and the cons with I think coming into Florida saying they're going back to the year X or or just kind of trying to figure things out on your own I think it's all of it is applicable to your your current circumstance, because the reality of your situation is. your homework in the sense that you're not in your own place you're not able to manage your own. You know your shelter, where you are nourishment. And so, but but I sometimes we don't necessarily. see it as being homeless, because we are we have shelter we're staying with someone someone is a comedy. So then, you say that i'm not homeless or like even though you're not completely comfortable at your friend's place or you know you saying that if your roommate you're not. Completely comfortable there but somehow you have convinced yourself that you are comfortable because you you feel you that you're able to come and go you're able to buy your groceries you're able to still have you know, whatever animals or whatever. your sense of smell is still there, to some degree. So we we convinced ourselves to find comfort in that, even though the reality is i'm not comfortable with it, I am homeless, but i'm not it kind of like my my daughter my daughter had showed me something to say you know if this concept i'm happy. I am happy, but i'm not i'm comfortable but i'm not i'm homeless, but i'm not i'm this but i'm not and so you think about why is it so it's less someone confused that you mean you're not. i'm happy. Overall, but i'm not happy with my current situation. i'm double where I am because where I am they're not making me feel uncomfortable, but I am comfortable, because this is not my own. i'm homeless, because I don't have my own key and my name that is on the leaf, and my name is not attached to this place so i'm not homeless, but I am."
2847.0,Patient,about to be.
207.0,Provider,"Even though you're about to be okay, he has to be moved this weekend, can you move in with can you move with him. and say there temporarily."
2847.0,Patient,Not that too far it's just like holes.
207.0,Provider,"In it okay so but i'm asking reality questions, I mean i'm not necessarily and so i'm going to be pretty blunt indifferent, of how asking the question. So far, um it's not something that you necessarily want to do. But you moving this weekend, can you move in can you move with him and say we're here."
2847.0,Patient,Now i'm going to say no.
207.0,Provider,"Is it no because you don't want to go, or is it no because he is telling you hey you need to figure out where you're going to come Saturday i'm moving on in here, and you can come wearing."
2847.0,Patient,"Not it's not to that point but. I mean. pretty much, and then I wouldn't be able to work yeah just yeah pretty much. pretty much a yeah."
207.0,Provider,"Okay, so i'm actually you. know in between. The questions like that, let me, let me ask the question is it you can't you can't say, are you pregnant women living in the how are you. Listening to me so."
2847.0,Patient,i'm gonna say no.
207.0,Provider,"Okay, so it says to you. I am moving 20 minutes more and where I am going, you cannot be there, so no."
2847.0,Patient,one's ever said that.
207.0,Provider,"Okay, so so So then, therefore. If push comes to shove in with your reality. Technically he's moving out of this place and wherever he's moving, you can come face."
2847.0,Patient,"yeah I guess I said yeah probably. If I. push come to shove, a public good."
207.0,Provider,"Okay, so this is all just for your, for your answer is not been very street it's a matter of preference you don't want to go there, because of the location and everything but. It is zero below tomorrow."
2847.0,Patient,Yes.
207.0,Provider,"Are you. Are you pregnant or you're not and so therefore. You are homeless what your homelessness is not very real to you because you're not sleeping in your car. Your homelessness is not very real to you because you're not having to pick this up and going through a shocker your homelessness is not real to you because you're not outside as a matter of figure of speech sleeping under the bridge. You understand, and so, because it's not like that for you. The full motivation that you need to go out there it's not there, so the question is mom says hey Jeanette come back before, and you have a place to take you to get a job and it's just a matter of preference for you, especially when it comes down to. So."
2847.0,Patient,"Which word I did the pros and cons and. I actually would go but. I would miss my I would lose my insurance that's my main that's my main toss up on that is I would lose my insurance and I need it, I need it for you guys, especially."
207.0,Provider,"If you came to Florida, because you get medicaid Mary."
2847.0,Patient,I get medicaid here.
207.0,Provider,in Florida you ain't no. Baby mama care. You could probably get. In and you won't be able to be. If you can afford it.
2847.0,Patient,yeah or you can't give right you don't do. That on do by heart.
207.0,Provider,You would have another.
2847.0,Patient,"yeah that's the main that's the main. Why say no, there, otherwise I probably would have already left. That was my main thing on that one."
207.0,Provider,"But but Okay, but but truth be told me, can you find another program like this in Florida something similar."
2847.0,Patient,You guys were the first ones that I even heard that. Did this I don't think they even I think you guys are the first ones I know in Ohio I don't even know if they have another one for real.
207.0,Provider,"No, they don't I think they're working on, but I think it's the medicaid medicaid I don't know what will be the reason why I think they're trying to come to Florida, but Florida Florida um."
2847.0,Patient,yeah and it looks so different like I grew up there and i'm looking around like everything is so different. doesn't even seem like I grew up there.
207.0,Provider,Winter park right or.
2847.0,Patient,Orlando yeah I went apart yeah.
207.0,Provider,"So it's. Okay, if your truth was you had to go live in a shelter right now let's just say you had to go live in a shelter, there was no grandma's house the state, you had to go live in a shelter or. You pretty much if you had a cardiac this week in your car, would you actually entertain your mom offer a moment before. Yes."
2847.0,Patient,"I would, but i've never came off a sub either, so I don't know how bad you know."
207.0,Provider,"I have 30 I mean if you if you if you had to move or get discharged. From this program because of coming to Florida I believe they wouldn't give you a 30 day supply or or you, they will give you enough to give you time to find another program there are programs here. I don't know that Florida has online programs like vince I don't think for to have I don't know. Right so maybe you have nothing. you mean. The options are there, it sounds to me doesn't matter."
2847.0,Patient,"yeah. Talk to you weeks ago, you were in your I guess your son was sick. I was already thought I had so much your son was sick maybe I don't know that's what I think they said."
207.0,Provider,"Oh, I was."
2847.0,Patient,I was thinking you are sick.
207.0,Provider,"yeah. I will take a. Generic I think if you take it from a standpoint of like you said you're using no difference between reality and a dreamlike state or just kind of essentially will put it on you as well, your reality is beating down the door. I think there's there's that place of if I ignore it long enough. Then, something will happen."
2847.0,Patient,yeah.
207.0,Provider,"it's like not long enough something will happen my husband always says, you know hungry, because if you're hungry you wouldn't sit there and think about what you want to eat you're hungry. i'm hungry and I said, do you want me to go now. If you were really hungry you eat whatever I. And I think it's the same thing your reality it's not at a place where. You have the full."
2847.0,Patient,motivations.
207.0,Provider,To just do what. Do you okay we're.
2847.0,Patient,Saying St Vincent.
207.0,Provider,thrift store do you be willing to just work eight hours a day.
2847.0,Patient,yeah pretty much.
207.0,Provider,And you don't have a partner and don't.
2847.0,Patient,just say I just worked there.
207.0,Provider,"And do you have. Now, have you generate enough income or you can't afford a place on your own."
2847.0,Patient,"I can but it's hard, I mean and and to find a place that I can it's hard you know i've been doing it, I mean before I started saying here, I was doing it, but it took me a year to get in place, I was in you know from the Left. Everything went up. And if you don't have a partner it's it's expensive I barely alone barely but yeah I can."
207.0,Provider,"Do it. seems a hard it's like I went to go get my nephew's phone, the other day, and I said, you know how much for the new phone I say, or you know, whatever the number is coming down and the guy said I pay 1500 for mine and he was like the new one, at any cost. 1800 1800 dollars, I said buddy. that's what that's the price of a one bedroom apartment helped me making sense of the. 1800 dollars, I could afford a one bedroom apartment on my own with the way things are going. It only makes sense and so. Your position right now. Your reality is that. And you want to be able to find whether it's an efficiency of studio a one bedroom apartment whatever it may be. and to be able to afford it and i'm not encouraging you to go take on a full time job I mean to go work 2323 jobs and do that indefinitely, but if it is that you need to take on. Something else part time or on the base that you're not working for a couple of hours to generate enough income for a down payment on something that you can afford on your one job monthly with all your all your bills."
2847.0,Patient,"it's hard. Right it's hard everywhere, I guess, so I people have partners."
207.0,Provider,"you're right people have partners, but then there's a whole there's a greater number of people who are by themselves, trying to figure it out by themselves. And you have to figure it out by yourself, it means that I need to re evaluate. Do I need. A $60 a month phone bill Do I need cable and I can watch TV on the phone all you. need. During this i'm saying why. Are all these other things."
2847.0,Patient,needed what you need and what kind of.
207.0,Provider,thing.
2847.0,Patient,yeah i'm kind of. spoiled I guess that's.
207.0,Provider,"So this is the homework and this is a new homework from us. Is that you need to sit down and evaluate your needs and your warm. And if you're finding yourself with your needs and your because you just said i'm spoiled you spoil yourself if you're fighting yourself. With your knees in your. that's what's making it hard for you to embrace independence or or or yeah independence that's what's making it hard for you to embrace independence, because you're fighting your needs and your one."
2847.0,Patient,that's true he nailed that one is true. Really.
207.0,Provider,"All these nice things I want to look a certain way, I want to do this that's a one that is not me what I need to show for what I need is what I needed to. cover up my makeup and what I need. And so, therefore, what I need to do is work to provide so you remember the Google, we talked about maslow's hierarchy. A massive hierarchy of needs and the very first one is your basic needs."
2847.0,Patient,Are the award.
207.0,Provider,Remember that's where Jeanette event. And you they're fighting with the basic one.
2847.0,Patient,"I am to. I mean I yeah I mean I get I have yeah. Like go back and forth of my head, but that's true. i'm finding myself against everything I feel like. Whenever I go. To go to grandma's that's another thing my moms like well, that would that. mess up your sobriety. And I said no, but I haven't moved back to the city either, since I left since i've been clean."
207.0,Provider,"Okay, so let's."
2847.0,Patient,Even though it's been 10 or 11 years but you know I just. have my error.
207.0,Provider,"Let me explore why your mom asked the question, well, that must be."
2847.0,Patient,Because i'll be back around the people and places that I used to run.
207.0,Provider,That you haven't been back there and a couple of years. How long have you been consistently without a without a fall How long have you been. clean.
2847.0,Patient,"Oh, except for weed about 1011 years. i've been on subs that's what i'm scared of getting off of them, because I haven't. been off for this."
207.0,Provider,Literally smoking marijuana use the marijuana prescribe something.
2847.0,Patient,yeah I got a card.
207.0,Provider,But it's not a funny thing.
2847.0,Patient,yeah.
207.0,Provider,What is the medical.
2847.0,Patient,Because I have have seen it gave it to me.
207.0,Provider,To marijuana.
2847.0,Patient,"Mainly that's just what you have to. Where you get your card, you have to have certain reasons that that qualify by region that qualifies."
207.0,Provider,done with Jeanette.
2847.0,Patient,"Well, I don't I haven't even been smoking that much really kind of given me anxiety for real. But that would decide that and that's that's, the only thing I can slip up on once a while."
207.0,Provider,"And the truth of the matter is. Are you really sure, even though it's been 14 years of not being on the drug. of your choice. Or the different drug has it really truly been consistently, are you strong enough to go by your parameters, because we only get. marijuana and we are doing it really truly reparation we and it's not because the doctor is monitoring you on just like the suboxone. The suboxone is something that is being prescribed by definition and see monitored by position you're going to therapy and you're doing all of this different stuff right. it's just a matter of saying hey I need to work, I need to do my due diligence, I need to change my mindset, I need to really, really tap into the core of the things that triggers my anxiety and and trigger. My fears or you know why I need to tap into that and so once I start working on those things I will depend less and less and less on the suboxone eventually coming off of it you're not at that place. So I would tend to err on the side of agreeing with mine and going through grandma is that something good for you."
2847.0,Patient,"And, and I want to say, I mean, I want to say i'll be okay, but you never you never know you know I."
207.0,Provider,haven't came up here if you haven't changed your mind. Then.
2847.0,Patient,"If I just go there and the worst and just stay out of the way, is that I picked up, I mean I know i'll be fine, but if if I happen to run into somebody and be like like even my sister even my own family run into them and then it's. You know. Not saying I would do because I don't even like crave to do it, I wouldn't go, but my sister get high, but I just know that. Are new things happen, you know, and I don't want to be in that predicament."
207.0,Provider,Okay.
2847.0,Patient,All the time it's not me.
207.0,Provider,"Okay, when you started using nobody comes into the world into the world and things into the troubled world right we. traveled the world right. But we made it the way it is right. You are born into your mother brought you into. This world that are in trouble right. And for you. Whatever you've been through you were. Whether it is to marijuana expert they introduced him to cigarettes, the introduction to. Alcohol whatever with your introductory something got you on it right. Right and whatever got you on it, it was because you were going through something that you felt was overwhelming and you couldn't handle it and whatever you started going you felt put you at ease mentally emotionally and physically it put us. onto something. you're not completely strong right now, yes you've been away from all that you were used to for 14 years but you're still on the is still smoking in a habit that you know. and Like you said you're on the sub. But trouble is still knocking at your door, it is down. Over to your grandmother. The stress that you're under in your face with the invitee that you're dealing with don't you think if someone comes and offer it to you it's only, but so long, you can resist it."
2847.0,Patient,that's what i'm scared.
207.0,Provider,"don't know, I think it is that you know it is that you don't necessarily have the motivation and the support you're seeking to help you get through it."
2847.0,Patient,Maybe.
207.0,Provider,you're used to having someone there with. How long has it been thinking along to have to figure out anything along.
2847.0,Patient,"The last couple years well, he was still there, but he did. Nothing."
207.0,Provider,But mentally you know physical. Physical being like this. yeah you found a way to get. through it.
2847.0,Patient,"yeah Lisa has had somebody here, so I guess just since i've been over here because I always had somebody I could at least you know. Tell something and have their point of view or their input on stuff so I guess just be it just."
207.0,Provider,dependency. you're free to do it all.
2847.0,Patient,"yeah to a point, but i'm going to."
207.0,Provider,"you've been doing it alone, for a long time. You just. Tell yourself. That you're not doing it alone because he's physical body was there."
2847.0,Patient,Right.
207.0,Provider,"you're technically doing it alone now and trying to figure it out, but you tell yourself it's Okay, because your friend is in your living in your friend's house and somebody is there."
2847.0,Patient,"A little bit sounds stupid, but yeah."
207.0,Provider,"Ultimately, what it is."
2847.0,Patient,yeah pretty much.
207.0,Provider,"it's because of physical so, so there is that level of dependency you depend you've always been dependent and so, if you're working and you're. Paying your bills and you're putting yourself and he wasn't giving you are ready. For any of it you've been doing it alone, but now because. you're telling yourself I can't do this alone. kind of been doing for the last two years."
2847.0,Patient,yeah.
207.0,Provider,"You see how powerful the mind can be. Your abilities you doubt your abilities, but you've been doing it alone, for a long time."
2847.0,Patient,"are just thinking about that, like. i'm worried about stuff i've already been doing."
207.0,Provider,Self confidence is really.
2847.0,Patient,backwards. yeah I know my mom said. She cried.
207.0,Provider,"The contrast is very low. And then maybe you know, maybe getting up every day and thinking that you can do it with another day that we're giving you can do it. You can get."
2847.0,Patient,"Like and I know I can. Just piles up real fast yeah. that's it that's why I used to get high, so I think about none of it."
207.0,Provider,"I like to draw analogies. You just said. The kitchen. Right. You don't have any there, and you see the dirt. i'm asleep stuff but then we go about and we do other thing more dirt calm no dirty Can you see the dirt. But then you keep ignoring after 10 days does the dirt stay the same, or does it just keep going up it."
2847.0,Patient,goes up yeah.
207.0,Provider,So this is a statement is that it wouldn't be that high if you have taken care of it the first time.
2847.0,Patient,Right. Choices I guess.
207.0,Provider,"And then you get overwhelmed if you get you get so overwhelmed and then you just like oh I can't do all you can it's just that now. you're so confident, would you say you've always been that way."
2847.0,Patient,Probably not always bad. Probably just with my last boy I think with my ex I think you had a lot to do with it.
207.0,Provider,now down to you and make you feel.
2847.0,Patient,Oh yeah.
207.0,Provider,So he only made you feel like you're unworthy and you're you're unable to do something.
2847.0,Patient,yeah.
207.0,Provider,You got to get over here.
2847.0,Patient,yeah like 16.
207.0,Provider,"For i'm gonna i'm gonna say 16 but let's just say look i'm just giving 14 years. 14 years because we needed to get real seasoned in the relationship before I really start with the mentally emotionally that I need to get you to a place. Where your total dependencies on me before i've been on the big guns when you don't recommend you recognize it or you're so comfortable in the relationship. yeah you you can't come, apart from it right."
2847.0,Patient,yeah control freak.
207.0,Provider,"14 years I mean i'm in control of your mind and you're doing. So, now that you've gone, you have a hard time medicine so. You have a hard time believing in yourself, because for 14 years you stopped believing in yourself."
2847.0,Patient,"sounds bad, would you say."
207.0,Provider,that's why that's why it's so hard has become your favorite line it's so hard it's so hard 14 years you some deeper and deeper and deeper. into that.
2847.0,Patient,alright.
207.0,Provider,that's that's what's making it for that's the Community. When you keep them so. yeah it is. hard to believe in your soul it's hard to believe you can do it.
2847.0,Patient,"And then, as soon as I start doing it that's when he comes knocking at the door try to push it back down seems like that's why I just tried to stay away from them."
207.0,Provider,"Because you because you've been with him for so long. And having that companionship is part of why we keep going back so like you said, whenever you start believing in yourself and your ability and start working on your self confidence, he comes in, to remind you that you can't."
2847.0,Patient,Do it.
207.0,Provider,"Last time, you spoke with him. He spoke with him."
2847.0,Patient,"When I got back from Florida, like the same day started calling in."
207.0,Provider,"Okay, why What was it that you were ignoring his calls before. Why he's talking on the phone call."
2847.0,Patient,"He has he kinda like was knocking at the window kind of showed up in person, it could really avoid it."
207.0,Provider,"You then ignoring the dirt on the ground last two weeks, and it popped up. So what what's the difference you you're pretty good at ignoring things."
2847.0,Patient,That I am good at.
207.0,Provider,What is it that you cannot keep. You cannot you cannot muster up enough courage to continue to put that to to sleep because it's clearly to become toxic and prior to the official breakup it was toxic. You ignore everything else So what is it making it so hard for you to do this witness relationship that's clearly is keeping where you are.
2847.0,Patient,I feel bad I always feel that.
207.0,Provider,You feel bad about what.
2847.0,Patient,Do I just feel bad. or sorry for.
207.0,Provider,"You think you could save them, I want to answer that question. No, no, no, no. Do you did you believe that he doesn't have anybody else, and so you can you can help them, and you can save them, and you can change and did you believe that for a moment, did you honestly believe that. So, and you knew he had issues for a long time right."
2847.0,Patient,Oh yeah.
207.0,Provider,"So why did you say, if you didn't think that you can save him or you can help him."
2847.0,Patient,I just kept getting the change.
207.0,Provider,What about that things made you think that he would change.
2847.0,Patient,"Because because he would be durable. durable guy that I love it. used to be like let's say. I have a whole bunch of him okay did it slowly start to go where do I would see that person once like once a month, instead of 30 days a month, so far, I got to the point where i'm leaving."
207.0,Provider,"What I believe. I believe that the answer is testament question I believe you think that you can change him or you can say that, and the reason why I believe I believe you thought that way it's because. You will come back to the person who you would love them and Jeanette is to make adjustments within herself. She will make adjustment and accommodate a lot of the behavior that she originally thought that, when the faithful and she didn't like. But you know what I noticed when I just this about myself, I noticed a change, I noticed when I stopped doing this about myself, I noticed the change. So Jeanette felt hey you know what i'm the only one, I love them and i'm changing maybe a whole lot of people didn't show them the love he wants because, as women, this is what we do. All because. you've done all this adjustment you've done all this stuff. But get in the end i'm left with a broken heart i'm left to try to clean up all. We all do we put the sign in nobody's assigned to us that we could face me, because we cannot person cannot be helpless they don't want to be helped. To do therapy, to help people but guess what you know what you don't want to be helping that Naka de. And I, and I believe that the reason why you have a hard time ignoring him or. keeping them at bay, because even though he comes and he knocks. You need to stop looking at these people window, this is not my window, you need. This is not my window. The reason why you have a hard time doing it because you're some part in here that says, I can still help him I see him falling apart, I can still help them honey you both have drowned."
2847.0,Patient,yeah. And I probably do still never my head I guess.
207.0,Provider,"there's some part of you that tries to convince yourself that you can, but you don't recognize that you have your continuing to move you in trying to be there for him and the evidence of that is that you're currently homeless and not know what the next step is. you're in the sometimes we stay in a position, because we close our eyes to what life will be telling us. We do want to be here, I don't want to hear it in my. Mind doing nothing until you change something about you don't want to hear and I don't want to okay Okay, it was a little kid you talk a little bit. Long but i'm not moving on so right here. Next to you."
2847.0,Patient,This little kid I guess. I bet you're right everything he says.
207.0,Provider,"If you've been like this for 14 years in the 16 years in this relationship i'm not going to doubt that you don't love him. And i'm not gonna sit here and say that there's a part of him that doesn't love you he just doesn't know how to show it because I don't know him, but I can tell you. where you are is not a place to be and you can't get yourself out of that place because there's a big part of you that's worried about."
2847.0,Patient,you're exactly right.
207.0,Provider,"This very honest question in whatever you're looking for and whatever you're trying to work out, are you honestly honestly is what helps us get to where we want to be, because if we're not honest with ourselves, you lie to me all day who am I. I am nobody in the Grand scheme of things right. But your truth is your truth and until you tap into your truth, you will not be able to you will not necessarily be successful in moving forward so true. Are you trying to find something or work something out where he could accommodate him if he decides to connect."
2847.0,Patient,"directly at first, I think I was, but now I just don't care. If I got over that I think at first that's kind of what I was doing."
207.0,Provider,"Okay, and how long have you been passed."
2847.0,Patient,Since i've been back from Florida.
207.0,Provider,just been passed that what.
2847.0,Patient,I was like before either.
207.0,Provider,So you've been.
2847.0,Patient,There myself by. myself that I will will have a basketball. Reality I would be happy to have.
207.0,Provider,"In this is the thing you've only been hacked so what made in the last few weeks, and he said, you know what screw it i'm talking about me what made you get the point. And how long is that gonna last."
2847.0,Patient,Forget.
207.0,Provider,"What this is the thing. In the last week, because your mom, you said that your past. You have to be consistent with it because Jeanette. Jeanette you're the one day."
2847.0,Patient,Right to. me and I just don't.
207.0,Provider,"Have the homework, have you need to figure out your once in your needs it's not going to necessarily be effective is Jeanette is still thinking about. The one that helping her or the reason why she's in the muck so i'm not gonna for a moment, say, you know he is the reason why you're in luck i'm just saying until June that. is able to identify why she's in that block and why she can't seem to get out of it until you're able to identify it all the other homework that I gave you is going to be irrelevant, because you first have to identify. So, if he is the reason why you're in this month and you're staying in this month, you have to back through unit. Actual. When he come head to head with that truth, then it will highlight how dependent, you are on someone else. And once you confirm that reality Look how dependent, you are on someone else. you'll start working on gaining your own independent and engaging your own independence that when your mindset for because now you're now you start looking through a different lens. And once you start looking through that different lens and then you're able to identify your once in your needs, and then you start adjusting your life to get yourself in a better position to then pull back in entertainment."
2847.0,Patient,choices.
207.0,Provider,"identify what got you in the position, how did you get into it i'm not gonna put 100% on him because some of the Church, which is. So I will encourage you to really."
2847.0,Patient,"To make an appointment with you down, I guess, for next time because yesterday I."
207.0,Provider,know.
2847.0,Patient,It took me I had I guess you were sick last nerve it took me I was working so for 40 minutes to reschedule that appointment. Already did it it's crazy. The whole time.
207.0,Provider,Really.
2847.0,Patient,"know what yes what took so long, but yeah I was like what. yeah."
207.0,Provider,yeah let's. let's do 11 1111 right now so. i'm coming to the Wednesday.
2847.0,Patient,"Right, like in four different calendars. Calendar the walkouts."
207.0,Provider,"yeah sometimes we need that extra reminder, but also a good idea to put it on your phone. cuz you then you have an alarm on your phone."
2847.0,Patient,yeah I started doing that.
207.0,Provider,You have what kind of owning.
2847.0,Patient,This was. A stylist.
207.0,Provider,"I think if you also. yeah if you have a Google calendar, I think, Google calendars will even remind you, the day before."
2847.0,Patient,Oh yeah it does. remind me an hour before I guess I didn't.
207.0,Provider,"Even an hour before but it but um. I would encourage look for our next meeting, I want you to be able to come true true yourself and do it the way I just said. You know, think about why am I, you know what got me in the position that I am what were the contributing factors, how did I contributed or how do I open myself and allow myself to be in this position. and be honest with that, and this is how your honesty is, are you pregnant or are you not, there is no."
2847.0,Patient,"Yes, no."
207.0,Provider,"Yes, yes or no, and then, once you're able to identify that then we can start working on all the other things because until we come to our initial truth. Then it's going to be hard, because then, what we do is that we work around. And then we wonder why do I feel like i'm still in circles, because you're not you're not dealing with elephant in the room, honey, you can't get through the door until the elephant get out of here. You can try to work around all day long, and you can get overwhelmed but, until the elephant get out of here, there is no way for you to get to that. Alright, so I will see you tomorrow and group."
2847.0,Patient,"OK, I see you tomorrow."
