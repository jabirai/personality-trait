226.0,Provider,hey David. Did you go to the virtual clinic.
9380.0,Patient,Now I did not. Just text message.
226.0,Provider,"Okay, make sure you do that and. The reason is that if you don't check in for them, it looks like you did not show. up so. Let me, let me just do this really fast so yeah so, then what happens is you don't get credit for the session. Alright hey how's it going."
9380.0,Patient,"i'm doing all right, I guess. My lovely child brought back sickness from Oklahoma passed it to me. A doctor's appointment here they're carrying a little bit."
226.0,Provider,Tougher covered.
9380.0,Patient,yeah.
226.0,Provider,Okay.
9380.0,Patient,"yeah he's fine he just had a fever anything he didn't run a fever either he just kind of had a little bit of runny nose and costs and then I woke up yesterday and had a little bit of a sore throat. And then, today I woke up worse, I was like."
226.0,Provider,got it. So you can take zinc. Take vitamin C. tons of water flush flush that out of your system that sucks that time of year. yeah and the little ones always bring all the wonderful delicious amazing.
9380.0,Patient,walking petri dish.
226.0,Provider,"it's like whoa Willie corral. Oh yeah. And this, the number of things they touch in the course of like one minute it's like. And so, have you been able to work or you just."
9380.0,Patient,"Know i'm still kind of working on and speaking of which, so I may have to switch groups because. I got so with work i'm getting. moved over to a new project temporarily. And it's going to be for. My schedule is going to be like that for about three months, and so I don't know. That goes into effect this Monday this new project starts and so it's going to be from in mountain time i'll be working from eight to 430. And so I don't know what my I don't think i'm gonna have an hour at lunch just judging by the hours that it's going to remind me and that's just what i've scheduled but. i'll probably be working more than that, to be honest and some the project lead but um yeah I just don't know what it's going to be like right for those couple of months."
226.0,Provider,"um let's see, let me look at something really fast. I am not sure. that's a good question i'm not sure what to do about that, because there are the other groups, I know I think are full of somebody else in. Somebody else's having this same kind of issue and was not able to transfer groups, but that doesn't mean that something might may have changed in terms of you know. Availability space in the group, so what I would suggest that you do is I would go back to the virtual clinic. Go to. Go to virtual go to the compliance virtual clinic. And and tell them like what's happening because you might actually have to switch therapist to because I don't have well I do the only day that I have availability like APP it would be at like 430. I do. Is is on Tuesdays. The end might end up having to switch therapists depending on. What it, you know if they can get you into another group and. The other option is if it's just like they're like whoa this isn't going to work have them Dr Dr Armand might be able to give you some names of other places, that you can call try and get in and that's i'm just saying, as a last resort type of thing. Just does take time, I mean Dr element will definitely. What he has done in the past, he just continues to prescribe the medication. You know. For like a month like we don't just drop you. You know, we want, we want clients to get into other programs that's what they want and, but it is obviously a process right, you know you've got to do the whole intake thing again and you've got to. figure out how it's going to fit into your schedule. And I do, I think there are some. there's there's some programs that are a little less. time consuming and maybe. Then bright heart, it can be, for some people, especially for more of our working people. Now I know it's because you've got to work. Like, we know that. You gotta work. So that might be something that you want to do the virtual compliance and then also group talk to Dr Solomon. You know, see if he knows I see cuz I don't know what other groups, he does if there's another group."
9380.0,Patient,"To jack oh no more time this Monday, so I don't know if i'll be in group this Monday, just because it is the first day. But i'm gonna but i'll know more once Monday rolls around."
226.0,Provider,Okay.
9380.0,Patient,"yeah I was like because I imagined, I may have to switch therapists just because I know Glenn does do early mornings. Just because when I met with her before so like I know I couldn't she does like seven in the morning and stuff like that, so that would I could meet with her during that time. it's just a group, one that i'm not too sure about."
226.0,Provider,"Sometimes, what they like to do too is they liked put you in the Group, the person that does the group they like to have that person to the individual counseling to. Just cohesive makes it a little bit easier. What time was your other group before."
9380.0,Patient,"Remember that was the. It was at home on Fridays. yeah. Did you guys split about time because I got. Because it's about four weeks or no sorry no i'm looking at about 12 weeks 10 to 12 weeks of that. of it being like that, where it's just kind of Monday through Friday eight to 10 or sorry at 430 or eight to five and then after that that's when the project actually shifts and then, if you have more time available, then because i'll actually be working in the evenings."
226.0,Provider,what's your schedule now.
9380.0,Patient,Right now i'm fully remote so pretty much I I have I it's eight to five what I have a lot more flexibility.
226.0,Provider,"yeah so with this new project, you have to go into the office."
9380.0,Patient,yeah that's it it's out in the remote site that's the thing. yeah.
226.0,Provider,"Okay, so if you work okay eight to 430, then, are you off work at 430 and then you drive home."
9380.0,Patient,yeah.
226.0,Provider,"OK, and then how long does it take you to get home."
9380.0,Patient,"So, in the first part is going to be just like a 30 minute drive 3035 minute drive. And then, after once I I think it's once I go into the second phase of the project, so the first six weeks i'll be it'll be like a 3035 minute drive home and then, once we move into phase two after that six week then it's going to be a little bit longer because will be shifting locations."
226.0,Provider,"So really realistically you're going to have to have like a seven o'clock for like you can't even do like a five o'clock group because they won't even know if you're in the car like you could pull over in the car, but you know you can't be driving obviously."
9380.0,Patient,"yeah that's no problem, I mean there's a five o'clock group that would be perfectly fine. If there's something like that. yeah that would be no issues there actually."
226.0,Provider,"Okay. it's just that we find you in new Mexico group so okay. yeah i'm sorry I don't have any more info on that. yeah so you're working today right. yeah okay. So after urgent care. yeah you might want to give them a call or before whatever works for you sometimes there's a little bit of a wait to get into that virtual clinic if I say, maybe after urgent care I don't know whatever works for your day."
9380.0,Patient,"yeah i'm gonna have to do it afterwards, but not urgent case my appointment shooters actually like at 1015 so."
226.0,Provider,"yeah. Okay yeah so try and get that done today at all possible around. This because sometimes stuff. gets complicated. Alright, so how are you doing otherwise that cause that medication has your pain."
9380.0,Patient,"it's going to find everything else is one real all the pains going well it's a I would say now it's usually at about maybe like a one. i've been. doing quite a bit, and it may get up to about a three but that's it it's very manageable now."
226.0,Provider,and tell me tell me how many where you are with the suboxone but are you taking.
9380.0,Patient,"So right now i'm actually at 11 but I was thinking just because of everything going on with the schedule so again about doing the. doing the papering down a little bit further than that, just because it doesn't faze me to taper so that way I don't have to if I do run into any complications, or at least i'm on a lower dosage."
226.0,Provider,Maybe a little bit.
9380.0,Patient,quicker to take off of.
226.0,Provider,"yeah okay. Okay. yeah I mean you've done this before, so you know what works for you. Alright, so it sounds like other than just feeling sick. And sounds like I have an idea and okay my Ray."
9380.0,Patient,"yeah everything goes like this, this project like when they asked me to do it, I was really excited about it, but I, it was just a time of like odd great for those first few months I was like okay how am I going to work around group and everything with this. yeah and but that's why I kind of got some things in place so that way, at least I can taper down faster on the medicine, if I need to so that way I don't have to be on it quite as long. kind of men getting some good information so yeah as soon as I get done with urgent care i'm going to talk to compliance and see what I can do about that because, yes, there is a group that five. Here, that would be perfect, and then I would ultimately probably have to shift therapists just because I I know Glenn does have earlier times and."
226.0,Provider,"yeah I just yeah I just don't have those earlier times like I I I do like an eight to eight to four on Tuesdays I do. tend to six, but I have got group In between there so yeah so it just gets and that's my only like my later days Tuesdays. So. Is this project like top secret."
9380.0,Patient,"yeah actually water actually. Is yeah what my company is loaning out to the federal government oh wow it's a project that they've been working on for a while. And so they because of what I specialize in cybersecurity. Is what I specialize in. And so they they decided there they've been the company's been working on this project, because I worked for Facebook, is what it is and so. The company's been working on this project for a little while and so now, they were moved into this next step and so now they have their kind of loaning me out to the Fed for a little bit for this joint project that they're working on. So yeah I had to be vetted and all that fun stuff but yeah."
226.0,Provider,I was gonna say you must have pretty high security clearance that's. that's that's not yeah so did they come in and interview you and all.
9380.0,Patient,"That oh yeah they came in, so they can answer them they sent an FBI agent they interviewed me they interviewed my family they interviewed my neighbors they interviewed all my prior work history."
226.0,Provider,Oh you're on mute. you're on you're on mute oh yeah okay wait so they interviewed your neighbors.
9380.0,Patient,My neighbors they interviewed i'm all my old bosses they interviewed everybody that i've ever had contact with pretty much.
226.0,Provider,My God.
9380.0,Patient,"And then I had to go through to polygraph because the first one, they said they get your first donation inconclusive questions, and so they made me do a second what. Did they. Surprisingly, on the questions they asked during that."
226.0,Provider,Were they were they kind of weird questions.
9380.0,Patient,"Anyway, yeah. yeah they they touched on literally every point. In those questions there's nothing that's not fair game and those questions."
226.0,Provider,They ask about drug and alcohol use.
9380.0,Patient,and ask about that to you and and plus I had to do a drug test as well.
226.0,Provider,crazy. yeah.
9380.0,Patient,"But yeah it was it was definitely an interesting process, to say the least."
226.0,Provider,How how long was the process.
9380.0,Patient,"They take honestly about two months. yeah two months to go through the process um and I was on suboxone at the time man so since I was prescribed it that was no big deal. yeah that was kind of the if the park delay didn't know if I was going to get the top clients that I needed but they ended up, it was everything was fine there because I wasn't on that high of a dosage at the time when they did the actual drug test. i'm like yeah it's just about two months, all together, for for them to get completed everything, and that was just the questioning part and then I would say it was about another. Almost month post a 30 days for them to actually do the review the information after that and to give the approval."
