12948.0,Patient,"yeah yeah especially like now. The mall went back to currently they went back to like regular hours and. Some, like. We haven't. adjusted our hours so we're still like the Wall was open an hour earlier today. And when I got here half the stores are open, half of them are not so it's weird."
304.0,Provider,it's weird So how have things been like fully open as far as like covert shutdowns.
12948.0,Patient,"I mean we're we're kind of been on like Kobe. They don't have you know. What do you call it, they don't have people to. cover those shifts so. They couldn't do it, but. My understanding was that the mall did go they were going to just stay on regular hours and they you know they some of the stores, I guess, are doing that so i'm going to have to ask my boss."
304.0,Provider,"Yes, I can."
12948.0,Patient,"I can work, you know I I need I need the money, so I mean I really don't care if I have to come in and our early you will stay in our later, you know that's. that's still like you know 30 something dollars for the week, it would be helpful. Sorry i'm just walking out of my."
304.0,Provider,"No money well I bet they're grateful low that like they do have people like you, who do you know one. To work and want the extra hours. yeah I feel so bad like for all the small businesses and like local you know restaurants, like here, I am in new Mexico that i've shut down because they feel like they. She was so hard because they like had to shut down, and then they could only reopen that limited capacity now, the issue is like yeah they're allowed to be open, they want to be open. But they don't have enough people to work."
12948.0,Patient,Right it's.
304.0,Provider,yeah that's just got to be so sad like salons like a you know now you're hearing that all these shipping delays that might affect like.
12948.0,Patient,"Christmas yeah. I went to a management meeting. Two weeks ago and they told us that some of our buyers are already telling us that we need to put in orders like you know, last last month, you know, so that we even have. product for next year because it's it's that."
304.0,Provider,it's that bad. yeah.
12948.0,Patient,"These are shipping days, so I I come in, and I do our shipping and all that. it's just it's overwhelming just because we get a lot of stuff but it's very easy simple basic stuff that I can handle."
304.0,Provider,"yeah good, and do you think the malls like or the mall where you work out like are they going to do, like a full like black Friday kind of like."
12948.0,Patient,"um so the wet over the years it's always been that we. Thank you, that we open. It was always black Friday like at like midnight, the mall would open. Right and stay open, you know all day. and NATO date the last couple years. They actually stopped doing that in the do it where. The. We actually opened at like 7am. So it's it's. A little better. I mean that that is better instead of you know, I mean i've worked i've worked retail majority of my life so. Black Friday is always kind of crazy hectic. Like most companies like they won't even if you don't show up it's an automatic you know termination."
304.0,Provider,"On Thursday, Friday."
12948.0,Patient,"yeah like Thursday we're not open on thanksgiving. But black Friday, as far as I know I think we're we're just doing regular hours, maybe you know it's all about you know every company is different, like. We have we have the money they're going to give us the hours yeah."
304.0,Provider,"Well i'm used to be like Okay, you know towards what open at like 6am or 5am within which was fine i'm like yeah people want to get out there, and even in like I would. Think it's so crazy than when they would start at like thanksgiving like at 6pm and people are mind about five of best buy and Mike is a teeny really that great of a deal right I don't get it, but."
12948.0,Patient,"I. I am not a fan of you know, the. The like not that i'm not a fan of like holidays and stuff because I am it just it gets it can get overwhelming and. And just hectic. You know, even here like we I don't I never know you know it could be a Monday and i'll you know it'll be Pack. will be packed here and it's because we are single coverage, you know, most of our ships, you know you work by yourself, so it gets. The gets the a handful but you man."
304.0,Provider,"yeah but I love Christmas like you love the holiday itself and I love, like the holiday season, but then I do feel like the commercialism like the. Give it like it's too much sometimes but I don't know this year, like we really didn't do anything big for Christmas last year and, like my son went like over boy overboard with toys like I think he felt, you know, like guilty like that coven guilt that we like didn't. hate to do so much in 2020 and we figured like let's get stuff to have things at home for the girls to do, but now i'm like Okay, they have enough toys, I have to clean them up. And I don't want them to get you know he's like that they're so good, they don't ask for anything like they really don't even know what they want, like well that's good, then they just let's give them like experiences that's kind of my feeling is like let's take a. drive right."
12948.0,Patient,"yeah i'm all your goal, for you know, like homemade gifts and stuff like. Man kind of my thing."
304.0,Provider,yeah yeah but everything else is going well at home and. yeah family and all that.
12948.0,Patient,"When my grandmother passed. Those my mom took it probably the hardest, you know I kind of had made. I hate to say this, but like what she was she was in the hospital for like a mom. You know, after like the first like two and a half weeks I not to sound negative or like that i've been asked that I thought it, but I I kind of in the back of my mind I kind of knew that she was you know it was it was time. And that you know I kind of already came to terms that it, you know it's better than it has, I mean it sucks that it happened, especially because she. The with the autopsy we found out that more or less that the doctors didn't do what they should have and they they should have ran a stress test and they didn't. And it would have they would have saved her life and. But, to be honest, you know she. Had a poor quality, you know she she she wasn't that old she was only 17. She would have been 77 she was 76 but she you know the last."
304.0,Provider,You know.
12948.0,Patient,"1015 years and really, really bad she doesn't kick you can't walk really she sleeps they ever on hundred different you know, had her on all these medications and it just. It just it wasn't you know it wasn't, the best thing for her so I mean I look at it, as you know, she's not suffering, but my mom walk away she took it, you know the hardest, you know she she kind of you know, went off on me and I think that was just her you know I didn't take it to her. You know she was just angry and."
304.0,Provider,"You know we're but I mean you know she's grieving that so are you and. Right yeah and I don't think that sounds like. cold of you at all, you know you were just preparing yourself and like you had a chance to say goodbye and. And you had a different relationship, you know, of course, but also yeah I mean it's so sad but I think you recognize like she lived a full life."
12948.0,Patient,"Right exactly you know I I that's The one thing I rather you don't want your loved ones, or you know friends family whatever to suffer, you know you rather. Rather, have them comfortable and you know. sucks that she's not here but. You know it's that's life more alive co it it's gonna happen."
304.0,Provider,yeah and so will this be like your first Christmas. Without her and yeah.
12948.0,Patient,"yeah she she had passed September for and her her you know this September was her birthday, just a few weeks after she passed was a birthday, and it was kind of. rough we were going to do something, but you know we with with not knowing what really had happened. We ended up not doing this research, you know anything. We ended up you know, putting the money. I think my grandfather's. filing a lawsuit with the hospital, unfortunately, and all that, so I mean. The money and. You know, it was going to that instead of you know, a service which there's not enough but they're really I don't have a big family and it just wouldn't have made sense to do is do a big service when that costs, you know thousands and thousands of dollars so."
304.0,Provider,"yeah well that's unfortunate yeah but he's still like grieving but it's miss. misdirected anger or it's miss. Like yeah. So, will you will your your mom and your grandfather, and the rest of the family, get together around the holidays."
12948.0,Patient,"We my sister was going to come up you know when she had passed, but you know she would have only been here for you know. This service, and you know just a couple of days, then would have to go back home, so my sister's birthday is actually Christmas, so they decided not to come down in September that they're going to take two weeks and come for Christmas and that way they can see. Her girlfriends family and our family and. we'll do that this year. But this will actually this thanksgiving it'll be the first thanksgiving i'm my boyfriend's. mom had invited us. To thanksgiving so that'll be nice."

A relationship with you know my axes, you know failing so it's it's different I like it it's it's you know it's Nice, you know his family they're nice to me they they, like me, I. This mom especially, which you know kind of you want to make a good impression. she's she's really nice and. My mom is in her and they just recently met. Maybe about a month ago. So. Baby steps it'll be nice to. just have a nice holiday and. You know, because it would have just been the three of us and they're a family of like 678. Something like that, so it will be nice. something different for the holidays."
