Trying to. get through it, you know. i'm and I don't know if it's medication related or just the time of year. But it's where I just struggle harder to with my depressive depression and my thoughts of like hopelessness, or whatever it is, you know we're like I don't say good things about myself."

10133.0,Patient,"I I don't really notice a difference, like it's just this I feel like the way I can describe it's like i'm. This cloud just comes over me so weird to say it that way, but. OK and. And it's I can't get out from under it, you know or I mean I do eventually but it's like I almost have to write it out. it's um it's what. You know, really prompted me to get on medication, you know. When I first you know realized or understood that I was happy having worth you know was depression, it was could be a chemical thing and I needed help with this. medication, you know I don't I don't believe vacations. Like oh you take a pill and everything's good you know. it's a tool. So I feel like I don't know chemical thing. Brain chemistry thing I don't know."

10133.0,Patient,"i'm. Here and. Just you know a lot of. A lot of. Get worry anxiety over things I have no control over. And also. i'll just you know a lot of what I like to think i'm getting better at is just but it creates that it's more of like this fight against like. But, will you know where I am in my life and. My all my failures can what got me here. That hopelessness, which is. it's the whole you know, like I know. I know. it's done but it's like geez I don't know it creep comes back in you know and. I mean, I think, actually, I know it's better."
527.0,Provider,Okay.
10133.0,Patient,"Well, I wanted to go away forever."
527.0,Provider,"So, so why, why does it get. Why doesn't get power to come back in."
10133.0,Patient,I would like to know. Is it. A physiological thing or is a mental health. or no. um.
527.0,Provider,"Well, I know that what's the."
10133.0,Patient,"failures there's sometimes there's triggers. All the affiliates are well the failures i've just you know. I think. they're just like you know at my age. You know the things that that I thought I would have or or a place that I thought I would be or in my whatever like. more able to, for example, more able to retire in a financial better financial state financial that you know if that's a big triggering their financial worries I didn't have them, you know as much as I had them in the last few years, you know, probably the last two years, even more intensely. But I would say. i'd say it's been longer than that but it's you know cogan was gnarly for me for my business I. You know, I also believe that you know part of that's controlled by me, you know I don't want to blame it all on coven but. kind of that's you know a lot of stuff like fell down that I didn't expect to. In your culture, I mean I was just like what is happening, you know. Sure, and that's that things have never happened to me, no, no 30 years I have my own business. You know, losing accounts like one or two, but not all, almost all of them. That was and."
527.0,Provider,Where are you at in reeling from that.
10133.0,Patient,mean What do you mean in recovery. Like i'm offering you mean getting more new accounts.
527.0,Provider,"know just. What just like how how have you been you know, since co bed, you know how have you been recovering from that."
10133.0,Patient,"I think i've recovered in terms of like you know that paranoia or whatever. You know I think a lot of people felt, you know just. Being so such a German folk you know all the time that part it's the financial in the business thing like it's like my business has become like so comparatively to where it was you know before coven like I don't even have half the accounting staff."
527.0,Provider,Okay that's why I was like wondering like where you are at this.
10133.0,Patient,"path yeah so and I got a. it's like I have to find a new way or ways that I haven't had to do with a long time, like I used to um you know. You know I had a bird I used to advertise even I don't do that I did you haven't in a long time. haven't had to because i'm in a small community and I get referrals a lot and. Sure, and. yeah that's what I don't know some so, then I start thinking. Well, is this a message like i'm not doing this anymore I don't know it's been such a like very extreme. I mean, I was kind of you know at this point in my career kind of cruising and whatnot cruising but, like in a comfortable place because I."
527.0,Provider,Have a.
10133.0,Patient,"Stable yeah and. yeah a lot of lot of long term clients and and you know kind of a cool place that you it's been kind of more fun because of all the experience I have. You know I using it, you know doing a lot more consultations and just just in a more comfortable place and I was a long time ago I didn't know any you know. What it's about running a business. And it's just like kind of pissed me off."
527.0,Provider,Okay yeah.
10133.0,Patient,"I mean it's like cheese, I know it's like Okay, what have I done to create this you know and and I, you know be honest about that you know I don't I don't believe, like. Blaming is is effective, you know, like oh yeah it's just because a coven I mean I know that's part of it, but."
527.0,Provider,But have you allowed yourself to feel the anger and the loss that that caused for you.
10133.0,Patient,Maybe not.
527.0,Provider,Because that's a valid feeling.
10133.0,Patient,"i'm so worried about surviving. You know I you know it's like. If I know that I don't have time to be angry or grieve what i've lost. That could be I can be I am definitely have not done that, I mean i've been upset but it's been like I can't you know I still have to make money, I still have bills to pay the bills not going to stop. So I can't stop, and in fact I have to be more on it than normal because I got to be finding other ways to new new it just never was hard for me, why is it harder now I don't Is it because of me or because of the times, you know so."
527.0,Provider,"So let's think about the rational versus irrational thoughts in that. Okay, what How would you answer that. question is it you or is it the times."
10133.0,Patient,"Well, I think, is both honestly. But I think it's. You know, I also believe in, you know personal power like it's it's it's about. And maybe i've conveyed a different energy because i've gotten scared for that what never was before. Very confidence and so maybe people pick up on that I don't know, maybe i'm you know I definitely feel less. Confident. about my abilities than I ever have. And it's so dumb because I know i'm better than most, and again in my little niche I know. Because of years of doing it, and just. You know it's not a brag thing I just know where I. You know what i'm good at."
527.0,Provider,Good good.
10133.0,Patient,"And, but yeah. it's been difficult to to get new accounts. um."
527.0,Provider,"What do you think's getting in the way Julia like it, because first let's just look at how coven has impacted everybody like it turned."
10133.0,Patient,People are paranoid.
527.0,Provider,yeah it and they're turned everybody upside down and and they're still and it's still impacting I know. I know we're still we're still trying to get back on track with it so yeah I think there's you know that that probably is driving some of it like you're fearful other people are fearful so we're very cautious and not doing things as much as.
10133.0,Patient,Right.
527.0,Provider,"And and learning to do things differently, you know, look at all the Tele health stuff that. which you know you go into the you just used to go into the office and see the therapist and now like that's whole that shifted for all of us to."
10133.0,Patient,Right and. that's definitely been we're trying hard time with that.
527.0,Provider,yeah so.
10133.0,Patient,"So day like today i'm grateful because. I don't want to drive me crazy weather. So getting you know it is maybe it's just me to learning the fear of learning new skills or new ways of doing things. And thinking and thinking i'm too old to you know which is. You know I mean some of my friends who are like my age i'm 64 they are older. Meaning meaning they and they're done like they're retired and they to me they're just not as active. And that's okay that's them. Sure, and I think well, am I, being like unrealistic about myself, because I don't feel like done, you know, like I. Do like. My job I like what I do it's physical or some no I don't do like the crazy stuff I used to do. crazy meaning I don't climb up on ladders as much and. trees and do all this stuff you know and landscaping lives, you know digging. crazy ditches you know for for drains and stuff no I I heard that out gladly but um I just till it's like. I don't know i'm confused there's a lot of extremes at my age and then I you know just like well, so what you don't need to compare yourself to other people, but you know i've had more time to think about that stuff. that I have. In a long time, you know and it's like gosh you know I don't feel those limitations, you know. Thank God and. Then I think it might be an unrealistic, you know I don't know are questioning everything you know."
527.0,Provider,"So what's the truth and all of it. What do you know, is the truth and who Julia is and what she's capable of."
10133.0,Patient,that's a good question. well. The truth that I just know what I. What I still want to do.
527.0,Provider,"Okay, so you."
10133.0,Patient,"You have that I don't know if. that's the true you know if that's being realistic, but I still want to work. You know, managing homes. Okay yeah that are that are you know vacation properties for people it's a lot of work, but I know i'm good at it. Okay."
527.0,Provider,"And how did, how do you make that happen, how do you continue to make that happen for you. If that's your goal."
10133.0,Patient,"I feel like I just have to be more relentless and more more assertive whatever it is, with. Colin can quote, that I know are in the industry realtors that have properties that they."
527.0,Provider,"You know, need to manage."
10133.0,Patient,"and better too much you know because I can do more, I you know I could do not just the landscaping but you know I can manage the. You know what's needed in terms of keeping the House up. and But sometimes realtors it's like they want that's what's happening is like their business that's definitely. When I think about that one of the reasons, probably religious i'm willing to give them up like they used to it because they're not as busy there's the markets we're. there's not as much on the market, you know the there's a glut in the amount of homes available to purchase and so maybe that's I gotta be realistic about that because I look at it, I look at it, as me like it might not as good as next to me, but I know I am. Okay, but it's made me question myself so much because it hasn't been as easy, and I think well gosh i've appreciated it more was I not saying you know not as I am grateful, you know and and i'm like Oh, this is like a mess. Okay, and I know it's gonna get better I do I know, but I, and I know I just cannot give up, but right now i'm just like. it's hard."
527.0,Provider,"Yes, cuz you're not thirsty anymore."
10133.0,Patient,"i'm trying to think, yes, that."
527.0,Provider,"you're not thirsty anymore and. Yes, all pieces that have worked together, for you are all have have all been impacted. Yes, coven and so everybody's learning how to do things differently to yeah and and I think we're slowly getting back. To that, but it is required, it is requiring us to be more creative and innovative and taking more time and energy, and that is that is the truth Julia is that that is you know, going to be a challenge."
10133.0,Patient,Because I.
527.0,Provider,"feel was like it was easier when when you're younger and. You know, have little little more energy, you know, things can be put in place a little easier."
10133.0,Patient,"yeah that that's probably that that's definitely true now i'm not i'm not the young person that could just you know bounce. Back as easily maybe that's you know what I need to just accept that and yeah creatively and innovatively that you know, I was definitely probably definitely more competitive in that regard, you know, I would just find a way. And so."
527.0,Provider,So what would you present to realtors now Julia.
10133.0,Patient,"i'm not sure if realtors is a way to go. But maybe I mean I don't want to roll that out, but there's got to be more than just realtors. Okay, and I can only take a few and then I still owe and, in addition to that, I still do you know maintenance on. You know i'm down to like two that are pretty Labor intensive and time you know they're good, solid well like I thought the other ones were too good income because their weekly and sometimes more than once weekly. basis, a lot of detail type of. Maintenance not like words are used to do like a lot of lines and. This is all like requires a lot of attention to detail and. You need to have a lot of skills for culturally without a feat things and take care of things and trim things and. yeah sometimes planting things easily it's just it's super I love it it's super crazy and keeps me I can't do, as many of those. And I don't even need employees. Most of the time. You know, because. yeah just yeah it's manageable the way I have it set up with my clients and I enjoy that. And I like being outside it's important to me so well i'm lucky, you know it's it's amazing the climate here so."
527.0,Provider,Except for today.
10133.0,Patient,yeah today's yeah. And you know what it's going to create more work because it's everything's gonna be a mess so it's kind of going away a blessing. yeah so.
527.0,Provider,"But yeah it had a half, so how does Julia get her groove back."
10133.0,Patient,yeah there you go.
527.0,Provider,yeah.
10133.0,Patient,in a different way.
527.0,Provider,In a different yeah it's going to look different it's. So and it's not a net and it doesn't have to be. doomsday Julia like we've we've went through doomsday and So how do we come out on the other side and look down and it's going to look different it's.
10133.0,Patient,All you.
527.0,Provider,"know and and and that's Okay, you know different can be okay it's uncomfortable and scary. But, but it was uncomfortable and scary when you first started your. Unbelievable so never forget that."
10133.0,Patient,stealing oh.
527.0,Provider,"yeah so so yeah it's you know, but you figured it out and you made it work and worse and was successful and still successful."
10133.0,Patient,"yeah, although I don't feel so successful right now, not at all. No. i've barely because financially I am it's like oh my gosh it's so i'm struggling. i'm not making anywhere near what I used to make. And you know, money is important. and yeah so I gotta I gotta find a way to just stay out of that fear. And that hopelessness, as much as I can, I know medication helps and I know therapy helps but. You know, and it is, I am like oh my gosh. i'm so much better. But i'm just not there yet, and it still happens and they don't. I will say they don't happen the dark cloud is there as long. Okay, or the low points. But this I just hate it. and um yeah whatever I you know I can do not have that but I don't know if that's reality either you know because, even in group, you know. People are bringing up about like never having to take medication again and, when it came to a you know anxiety and things like that people, it seemed like you know. The the one who runs it what's her name is Mary kastner was saying that's realistic, you know. To not have to need medication, but depression, she doesn't feel the same way about you can reduce the amount, but like some people just have a brain chemistry situation, whatever you want to call it disorder malfunction."
527.0,Provider,Balance imbalance.
10133.0,Patient,"And so you know my dream of never needing and again this is probably not realistic, you know."
527.0,Provider,"But, but it doesn't have to be at the forefront of impacting your day today."
10133.0,Patient,"The feelings of depression yeah yeah but the medication, you know can't stop her."
527.0,Provider,In her shirt shirt.
10133.0,Patient,"So that's enough, but she was saying, you know, for most people. So the acceptance of that you know all right. um I wish I knew a magic way to make you know, whatever it is i'm lacking. serotonin or you know endorphins I don't know but they're at this point in time, I don't know of anything you know. hold it, you know that's doesn't come from the pharmacy. Sure sure."
527.0,Provider,"Well let's just talk about what. keaton whoo. kind of stuck in that dark cloud like So how can we move, how can we use that fear. and use it as a stepping stone versus staying stuck in that mud. what's what's The next step that you have to take for your business. That maybe you're."
10133.0,Patient,"I think I need to get business cards. Okay, I haven't had those for one time and."
527.0,Provider,You can make your own.
10133.0,Patient,yeah I think I should do.
527.0,Provider,Just make my.
10133.0,Patient,"coach i'm thinking about that because i'm like. Because, then people have some I don't know people like people even have asked me for business cards and i'm. Like oh that's what gave me the edge because i'm like oh I haven't mean you know, Adam for a while yeah."
527.0,Provider,"yeah and sometimes it's. Like you know what What did you do initially to get your business started and maybe going back and reviewing some of those things for yourself, some of those tools."
10133.0,Patient,"Well yeah it was. cash and it's almost like. it's amazing really what happened but remember was never thinking of having my own business, I was managing for another company. and One of their biggest clients come front of me and just you know fast for meeting with me and asked me if I ever consider having my own business, he would be my first client and I said I don't I would never steal clients from my just ethically. wasn't something to do and. He said well they're having some issues I don't know if you know about and they weren't a husband and wife, and you know my clients could could tell there was some issues happening in the company and. He goes well. that's what kind of sparked me to keep even consider that but anyway so. When I first I mean I was blessed like. Things happened and the company dissolved. And this client came forward again, I did not approach them and they even offered to give me a deposit to start my own business, which was greatly needed and I. took it he wanted it to be a gift and I didn't feel comfortable with that I said i'll work it off, and he agreed so we you know, but that was like. Oh, my gosh what a blessing, is that you know."
527.0,Provider,Sure sure.
10133.0,Patient,"and very mentored me kind of a little bit too, you know. But I did so that was a nice big chunk to start out with it was a big account just scary but I worked, it managed it, so I was had to have that level of comfort going on, but also. You know I had to get employees, I had to. I had to I had to ask a lot of people had to talk to a lot of people."
527.0,Provider,"Okay, so I need to talk to more people were how did you manage the fear."
10133.0,Patient,i'm just going to counseling I was in therapy that. way. But you kept pushing through.
527.0,Provider,Like.
10133.0,Patient,"The fear oh my gosh Yes, that was it was super scary. But I did I had an amazing therapist actually. yeah I didn't even remember, I thought until you mentioned like oh yeah. Because it was such a big that big move for me to do. Company yeah. It was like huge and I did so much to figure out, you know, and then you know I ended up also finding out I needed to have licensing for the state, you know contractor's license so. You know, and to find out, schools and how I can manage that and then going and getting tested and all it was a lot. I don't want to do that again. I don't like I don't want to have, like all those employees and. Extra vehicles and. I really don't so I liked my what I had going on prior to the last you know, to the to the title of covert and pretty you know I just pretty much said everything out there, they not everything, but a lot and just manage and. use my consultation, you know my my knowledge and in still keep those accounts, where I can like get my hands, and you know doing stuff. But it doesn't require me to. To have to manage employees, which is very stressful, in my opinion. I mean i've done it a lot but i'm not who. Like I would never HR would drive me nuts. As not a career, I. mean I I."
527.0,Provider,yeah. So what so what's a timeline you want to give yourself then Julia God.
10133.0,Patient,i'm a timeline you mean to. To have more accounts to be doing better.
527.0,Provider,"yeah what's gonna what's going to help to you know you need business cards like when's a realistic deadline like. same thing, like i'm going to do those in the next week or i'm going to do those by June, you know i'm going to. set a goal as of January one. i'm going to have business cards i'm going to start making these contacts like what what kind of timeframe, do you want to see for yourself, because I think it's it's holding you accountable to that."
10133.0,Patient,"too, I agree, and I work better with that with that too. Okay, so I think i'm going to well really realistically I wouldn't be i'm going to be in Texas over the holidays. So. And then I, so I would say, to be more realistic to do that, to think I would get it done let's see where's my calendar."
527.0,Provider,Like by the end of January.
10133.0,Patient,"that's more time than I thought, but that yeah I would say."
527.0,Provider,Like six weeks.
10133.0,Patient,"Six weeks yeah that sounds realistic how much would that policy one to. Mid January 456 yes six weeks is good yeah cuz that would be like just the week prior or. The week prior well, the last two days are like the last days of Monday so like by the 28th of January."
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
10133.0,Patient,yeah have at least at the very least business cards. Okay um.
527.0,Provider,What would be the next thing you would need to do.
10133.0,Patient,"I have this thought. Of like contacting people. That I used to do installations for. Okay, and just getting out, you know I don't know going through my phone and phone records and. I guess I would start with phone. and finding those people that I, you know, have worked for before done installations or and just call them and see whether you know just reach out to them and see if they need any help or have any."
527.0,Provider,"referrals sure, so do you feel like you could make two phone calls a week. Realistically."
10133.0,Patient,"i'm not over the holidays, but yes."
527.0,Provider,"Right, right after right after January one could you. commit to making two phone calls a week. For yourself up to outreach phone calls."
10133.0,Patient,"Yes, starting with July chance. yeah okay two calls a week. yeah and I yeah I feel like I just have to reach out, you know i've been sort of that is true, too i've been sort of just in my own little groove world and, and you know there's lots of folks that I. Actually, love to talk to again I loved working with them. and yeah I need to put it out there more. Okay."
527.0,Provider,And I think that will help to build just more confidence to. Talk talking people to talking to people again and just connecting again with people like just you know mind mm hmm.
10133.0,Patient,"I agree yeah there's like an energy that happens it's like this they're gonna like we can run remember life is the success we had. Working together and that will help me with my. and Sure, with like colleagues i'll just say. yeah. Okay, those are good things. yeah I just been you know what making a plan it already feels like relieving. yeah. Definitely, but i'm still gosh anyway, I need to stop. Worrying This is my demise. It isn't but. Mike it's definitely shaking me up."
527.0,Provider,"yeah yeah and I think it's just you know, I wonder if, maybe doing some journaling just around the impact of code. You know, and the all the emotions and changes it's brought about, for you and challenges but also you know what what were some successes in that for you like, I know it's probably hard to see them, but are some positives within that for yourself like. You know, did it allow you to just re evaluate what where you wanted to go or did it build you know more strength than other relationships or areas for you."
10133.0,Patient,yeah.
527.0,Provider,"So I think you know, being able, just to look at the whole impact of it on you in an invalid. And validate their feelings for yourself, you know, there was some losses experienced and and. An anger and frustration and things like that, and I think that that's been challenging for a lot of people that isolation was."
10133.0,Patient,"Oh yeah and I was super isolated, you know definitely you know when you live alone, like you realize it more."
527.0,Provider,mm hmm. But you're in and you're you're a very like. Like you're in with people.
10133.0,Patient,yeah your business so.
527.0,Provider,To cut that off for you was. yeah yeah.
10133.0,Patient,Definitely difficult.
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
10133.0,Patient,"And even socially you know it's this heart. Okay, look at the whole. Maybe just reflecting on that will help me with. The purpose of the journaling is to sort of just work to. Re evaluate what happened and."
527.0,Provider,"Just having these thoughts or you know kind of make sure. Concrete yeah and it's definitely challenging some of those irrational thoughts that come about to like Is this really an accurate assessment of the situation or of me. Because you're able to counter that you were able to counter that today of know I am successful, and you know confident and I have good skills like you're able to see that, but yet that that cloud wants to come in and you're like no like go away like no. that's not truth."
10133.0,Patient,"something, you said that I wasn't maybe considering as much was being realistic about where I am in my life to. I am not 30 anymore. And, and to keep realistic about what it is, I can be successful doing. So. You know. And because I really don't think i'd want to take on any big jobs yeah."
527.0,Provider,"Sure sure yeah I think you know where your limitations are. And, and so, with that what does what does life and work look like now."
10133.0,Patient,Okay. yeah. Okay. and business cards will make me really can. Put it and I could put on the card like what I really want.
527.0,Provider,yeah this is your opportunity to do. Your. You know your new your new direction.
10133.0,Patient,reinventing myself.
527.0,Provider,yeah.
10133.0,Patient,Okay.
527.0,Provider,yeah. So I wanted to check in how. Because I know the last time you were going to work on writing a letter. to your son and just kind of continuing to set boundaries with him.
10133.0,Patient,"yeah um. He did call a confide in me because it was I didn't know if he was he had said he was going to buy me a ticket to go to. Christmas there and so he did say he was having some money issues and he didn't know if you can afford a ticket. And so that was honest hearing he hasn't really sent out to me. And I said Oh, you know because it's been going on longer he said yeah I guess he just didn't want me to worry. The way he was acting was weird you know when I said, well, I just like that, when you're more blunt with me and just tell me. And he said he said yeah. He know he didn't want to talk a lot about it because he's embarrassed about the sun, but it's just been super challenging in his industry. and also with you know the transition of moving out of. The House that he was in with this what's this X. So. um. I haven't I haven't written a letter. And I need to do that. You guys still. do that. I did I, and I really want to do, but I want to find an hour long group to."
527.0,Provider,"Okay, I."
10133.0,Patient,"think I should stop me, you know I don't know if I need to go through all the steps again, but I think the supportive being an analogy on group."
527.0,Provider,yeah definitely.
10133.0,Patient,"Just to remind me of like. You know. it's just support it's a support. and which, I think."
527.0,Provider,"Well, I think it also would help just to alleviate those questioning pieces in that dark cloud that you carry like being. recognized mm hmm."
10133.0,Patient,"yeah that could be you know what that's probably a lot of it right there just being a codependent you know those codependent treats. me helped me a lot before, and this is going anywhere, you know my son is definitely not choosing recovery at this time. And it's you know i'm going to see him again soon, and I don't know I need to be able to cope. And to also. just keep my power."
527.0,Provider,yeah So what is the plan for the holidays Julia.
10133.0,Patient,"um I will be going at most me spending all the time with Lacey and the kids. i'm gonna my sister's going to let me know about she does a lot of traveling and as points and she offered to because I think I will be much better if I have a vehicle. and That they're super expensive rental cars are way and they're out of my price range, but she said she has some sort of points or whatever so. On a follow up with her on that and that might become a reality, so that would be a really good thing but really pretty much it's all you know and with you know Lacey and the kids. and My son he doesn't live there, so let me i'll see him occasionally but i'm not working, you know definitely not going to be. Moving him or like working. For him so. yeah so that's the plan, I mean it just i'll be there through new years. But I would love to have car so we'll see. I don't want to like I don't want to make it like where. I went, I just want to have I don't have an expectation, I guess, is what I want to say, because it may or may not work out and I don't want to be disappointed about it, you know it's like if it works it'll be great. You know sure and and and you'll make it i'll make it work somehow but. it's not like a mandatory thing. Because it's financially just crazy rental cars, right now, oh my God I can't believe how much they are. Everything is so much more expensive. yeah everyone's trying to like make up for I guess. It seems that's the vibe I guess."
527.0,Provider,it's probably accurate.
10133.0,Patient,You know.
527.0,Provider,Probably it is accurate like think about groceries and think about yeah.
10133.0,Patient,Everything is rosaries our way and gas here oh gosh it's so crazy here it's like almost $5. it's like what.
527.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
10133.0,Patient,"So yeah anyways. So. That is something that I have on my I made a list for today now finding an Al anon or options is. Because I mean I can't work. You know i've been putting that off. And I know that there is some ones that are online never done them online before. I think I would rather go in person, but we'll see i'm going to see what the options are."
527.0,Provider,"Well, I was going to say let's explore both options, so that you have you know if there's one not available in person that week that there is an online one and."
10133.0,Patient,No.
527.0,Provider,"Okay, now I can. You know I can flip flop back and forth between them to like not put limitations on. You know not catastrophizing oh there's nothing available so, then I can't do anything versus well this option may be a little more creative and different it's a little uncomfortable but it's still something that would be a support."
10133.0,Patient,Okay yeah that's a good idea.
527.0,Provider,it's kind of challenging some of those irrational thoughts for you.
10133.0,Patient,yeah yeah. Okay.
