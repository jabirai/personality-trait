Right. Ideally, these types of. Medicines are not. Medicines that we ideally want you to be on with buprenorphine."
5961.0,Patient,But that's why she only put me on a half a milligram of.
191.0,Provider,"Your on it three times a day, though."
5961.0,Patient,I didn't get to finish.
191.0,Provider,"Right, so we prefer no klonopin with the buprenorphine alok song, and that was one of the reasons why. I did not."
5961.0,Patient,Just. I get do the anxiety. Order it get merged been through Thursday night game.
191.0,Provider,"I understand. right here. At bright heart health wil wheaton everyone off of those types of medicines okay. yeah so your option would be miss pamela I know that vicki also does addiction. Okay, she asked she also she was humid up was she worth it, where she knows your."
5961.0,Patient,heart.
191.0,Provider,"she's a healing hearts, so if you're going to continue."
5961.0,Patient,your hearts in that building.
191.0,Provider,"Right, so if you're going to continue with the klonopin you may want to see if vicki if your primary care doctor will also treat your addiction, because I know she does addiction treatment also is that. I think she's willing hearts. I could be wrong, but I thought."
5961.0,Patient,i'd say so much. i'll ask her today.
191.0,Provider,"yeah asked her about that because we're so you know, Miss pamela we're winning everyone off of the binzel with the buprenorphine."
5961.0,Patient,"Well, I didn't know that you just told me."
191.0,Provider,"Right and that's one reason why you and I talked about it up and share it with you, I wouldn't be I don't get I don't start those kinds of medicines. You right. Take it."
5961.0,Patient,"off of it, two years back, will be two years ago."
191.0,Provider,"Right and i'm not saying, for you to take yourself off of it Okay, but what I am saying is that those are the types of medicines that we have winged patients have and honestly. You know this is concerning for me to. for you to be on the dose with the buprenorphine. Yes, very concerning so something we'll have to look at talking about is those your primary care doctor want to also treat your addiction."
5961.0,Patient,Okay yeah i'll doctor.
191.0,Provider,"Okay. And then treat. So she would do the addiction and the mental health. yeah and because the thing that may help is that if you're able to because you see her so often, you may be able to get more urine drug springs because. we've only gotten this year we've only gotten four urine drug screens and so with the buprenorphine being a control substance we really try to aim for. A urine drug screen every month okay. yeah so let me know how what she shares with you about that miss cross."
