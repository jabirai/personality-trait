760.0,Provider,"Okay. Okay, because you're not living on the street kind of thing because it's not like homeless enough kind of. situation or. What, how do you know if you haven't tried I guess is my question."
15782.0,Patient,"ages. Eight one of the places is that all men place in own. Here that places something, but like I just I just don't think about me, I think I tried those places before with it for those what's something else. it's always like a waiting list everywhere, he goes. away the result and, hopefully, no one can help you nobody can help you know help."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so Where are you feeling right now."
15782.0,Patient,On right now i'm just on my friends house.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, and how does that environment for you."
15782.0,Patient,"All right. All right, i'll just here for a couple of days."
760.0,Provider,Okay. Just here for a couple days and where you're going after that.
15782.0,Patient,um. But down. Down there to my mom.
760.0,Provider,"Okay. Okay, and how's it how's everything at work."
15782.0,Patient,"that's good and then. Work is this work can be. I don't know this week will work was pretty like I was on edge kind of but there wasn't right, but I was kind of on edge somewhat Sometimes I feel like people are trying to be a little weak but i'm not smart. And sometimes. Like i'm. more advanced than credit I get put four so probably mad like a day or two over."
760.0,Provider,"Okay. All right, so yeah sometimes it's hard, sometimes we can struggle with coworkers I think that's normal and you're working in a. warehouse is it. tesla you said it was it. Yes, so aware house is a warehouse. So you have a large number of people that are working around you."
15782.0,Patient,Multiple multiple multiple.
760.0,Provider,"yeah so you've got a lot of personalities, so you got people with different personalities and. That can be difficult."
15782.0,Patient,I think I think I have to the person always.
760.0,Provider,You yourself. yeah okay well you're carrying a lot of stuff. I noticed that in your records you've got a diagnosis of ptsd. Is that something you want to work on. well. You know what ptsd is you know I mean to tell me what you know about it let's just go from there if. You know something.
15782.0,Patient,At express or disorder by. Maybe that's what it is maybe that's why I can't control because I don't even know what the hell.
760.0,Provider,"yeah it's like. it's kind of like when the brain gets caught in a loop it's like where you know when when something super dramatic happens to anybody any of us, we have those fighter flight hormones that will search through our brains and cause us to want to. To protect ourselves it's a throwback from a long time ago for self preservation and so this can be emotional traumas or. attack you know any kind of trauma can trigger this, but when somebody who struggles with ptsd it's like their brain gets stuck in that loop. And so, even though the trauma may have happened like 20 years ago or however long ago, your brain continues to bring up those stress hormones and takes your takes you back to. exactly that time and and that's the experience that you live, and so that's you know I know that's triggering all kinds of emotions. But the reason that i'm letting you know about, that is because that's a physical thing those those are physical stress hormones that are going through your brain continuously. or during the times that you're triggered does that make some kind of sense to you."
15782.0,Patient,"yeah because somebody made me mad or i'll be thinking about like my past or something and just which is hey everybody in the room, oh snap on everybody and like you said, I have to protect myself first. mm hmm oh."
760.0,Provider,"yeah and so it's it's it's you know recovery from ptsd is like a process of. processing the feelings about the traumatic events we don't have to do that, you know do that in a place that's safe. You know I do you so you correct me if i'm wrong, but you take a lot of these emotions and kind of like try to stuff them down just because maybe i'm too busy I gotta get to work, I gotta figure out where i'm going to go. After i'm done living here for the next few days, so this constant stress causes you to take these emotions that you're feeling and my kind of perhaps push them down Alexis do you think that's a fair guess on my part, or do you think i'm off base."
15782.0,Patient,"No, you probably right so we'll talk about compress my films too much and that's why I explored altar."
760.0,Provider,yeah and then what what happens when we compress them then they're going to come out and they're going to come out at a time that may not be good may not be good for you are good for others. So what are some things that you can do to. express that find places and ways to express that.
15782.0,Patient,work out.
760.0,Provider,"Working out is great, how do you have time for that that, how do you how do you fit that you put that into your schedule or once in a while or. Having me about that."
15782.0,Patient,"No, I haven't but that always going to do it, but then I did it."
760.0,Provider,mm hmm and what stopped you.
15782.0,Patient,will begin to press they get angry about just stolen do share it. Baby will lower the amount they would get there on time so far no just personal health and just don't go.
760.0,Provider,"So, when you say go you mean go to a gym. yeah OK so maybe you feel that that's yet another thing i've already got all these things that I need to do i'm going to the gym is yet another thing. Because that is that part of your thinking."
15782.0,Patient,yeah like to go buy a little widgets.
760.0,Provider,"Okay well you don't have to go to the gym to work out you could do you could be there right where you're staying right now, you can do I don't know. You look healthy you don't have any physical reason why you can't exercise right do some push ups do some jumping Jacks take a walk around the block as long as the neighborhood is say."
15782.0,Patient,"The thing about me I don't think that's broken out, I think I need to go to the GMO us women shaving share our local wines off."
760.0,Provider,mm hmm well. what's going on you're looking frustrated.
15782.0,Patient,"yeah I don't know that's why like I got like I can do that, but to me like I don't know I thought I needed to go to the gym and workout I just I don't know I feel I. feel like I have like little equipment is shaped by four bands and checking us but. mission fanatical to get a world warcraft I have because you're not on a wi fi that lady. Okay, if I can do that, and I just don't even open it up on lunches I don't know."
760.0,Provider,"And then, when the fighter one fighter flight hits us when we exercise that helps us to burn some of that. Food through the physical movement and going to the gym that's a great thing. But what if you have to work I don't know your your ships are the eight hours a day, nine hours. Actually, your day is quite long because you have longer less rights right."
15782.0,Patient,"yeah they're 12 hour days, and then the bus ride is two hours so for days on top of a two hour bus ride I do like 1818 hour days so that's how I get home, while I have enough time to do is take your clothes off in the show go to bed I don't eat dinner at night."
760.0,Provider,"yeah I don't know see that doesn't seem feasible so. Okay, but do you think you get a lot of activity, perhaps walking to the bus stop or maybe walking that work."
15782.0,Patient,"yeah work I do a lot of a lot of it i'm walking. console possibly pulling like these carts that that that frame goes on, it goes into the testicles like i'm constantly pulling heavy shit on call."
760.0,Provider,So okay so you're burning burning a lot of physical activity already. Unless it's a day off.
15782.0,Patient,"yeah like when i'm off by i'm so burnt out by Angela my body rest, the whole day before I get up in like the next off the I can probably get the light like afterwards mean, like all those days, all those hours and just like that, like when my boss there every day is like i'm super down."
760.0,Provider,"OK Okay, well then that's that's one coping skill sounds like your work is doing that let's talk about how do you experience your emotions. What are you feeling. Right now."
15782.0,Patient,I know i'm just full or. Whatever like. No.
760.0,Provider,"Was it hard for you do, you are, you are you talking to me on zoom through a cell phone or what."
15782.0,Patient,yeah This is my cell phone.
760.0,Provider,"Your cell phone okay. All right, alright there's such a thing I would like to try to send to you called in emotions we'll Have you ever heard of or seen models."
15782.0,Patient,You know I never heard of one.
760.0,Provider,"Let me see if I can just bear with me, it can you i'm going to get up for a second and i'm going to show you it, perhaps I could email it to you afterwards we get done so give me just a second because I have an example, but I gotta get up and go get it so hold on. You can kind of. The inner circles are the basic emotions that includes bad fearful angry disgusted sad happy and, as you go out to this there's a look, you can see very well, but there's like an outer circle like an inner circle and then an outer circle, and if you take like. angry, for instance, they give you different forms of emotions feeling let down feeling humiliated feeling bitter mad. Further out there's words like betrayed resentful disrespected ridicule things like that so part of the process collects us, even though you know I know it's hard to deal with these difficult emotions, but when we're struggling with. Can you hear me. Yes, okay i'm sorry I forgot to put my headphones on so i'm glad you could hear me. So when you're struggling with with repressing emotions, I think a lot of the time we don't even we become like desensitized to even know what it is we're feeling and that's one of the reasons. You just kind of seem to flip a switch you know, for no reason that you can really identify and and I think that maybe keeping like in emotions love. would be good, either with your cell phone perhaps you'd be the easiest with your cell phone, because I know you're working a lot. But just maybe maybe in the morning, maybe as you're riding the bus, you can. Get out this wheel, you can you can either Google it but i'll go ahead and email it to you as well that if that'll help you but you. All you have to do is just saying Google emotions will and you'll several of them will pop up I just Google, the images this one I got offline. And just start to try to identify what it is you're feeling. And you know there's there's some positive emotions in there too there's happy, you know there's happy and then from happy we have things like playful contented interested accepted peaceful trusting optimistic. Three joyful curious. Confidence respected valued things like that, so you know, being in touch with one's emotions means whatever it is from the positive to negative. That you're learning to be more in touch with your emotions does that sound like something that you think you might be willing to consider or can you talk to me about. about that, and how that would work for you."
15782.0,Patient,"yeah I don't know how it will work for me, I guess, we would have to try it I don't know."
760.0,Provider,hmm. Could you.
15782.0,Patient,Do a write down my emotion I don't know.
760.0,Provider,"yeah just put like like let's say you're you're on your way to work, I know you maybe you're off today but let's say you're working today you just going to write down the date today, the day is. you write down the time it's about 1017 in the morning. You know, maybe you can make a statement i'm i'm on the bus to work i'm feeling like and and get out this wheel either online and and look at it and try to identify. Maybe three emotions, because a lot of times we're feeling more than one thing. And sometimes emotions can be conflicting you know, sometimes we might feel proud and angry, or even aggressive, at the same time, sometimes emotions don't even seem seemingly go together, but we feel that way. So I think one of the first steps might be for you to start thinking about what you're what you're feeling and becoming more aware of your emotions because that's one of the ways that you can kind of. Start processing through them so they're not like holding holding over your life and affecting you in ways. That makes sense. yeah I mean yeah I mean you, you it doesn't have to be like a you know, a whole page of journaling it could just be time or dates, or even you know. 10 320 21 morning three emotions, or whatever it is you, identifying that sheet write down the emotions and maybe a general idea of what's happening. And then maybe it's your lunchtime you do the same thing and then maybe as you're coming home or perhaps it bedtime whatever however you're getting your schedule, but you can use that time that you're on that bus to do it. And that you know that would be something that to kind of do. So this, how does How does that sound."
15782.0,Patient,"familiar with it, I guess, I don't know that i'd give it a try and."
760.0,Provider,"yeah and just keep a log in your you can either get a notebook or you could just write it right into your cell phone. Whatever works for you. Okay, and then, and then we can kind of talk about it, like see what else is going on. So your coat so as far as your coping skills, you said, I think you told me you don't really have any Is that what you told me."
15782.0,Patient,It was mine.
760.0,Provider,"Other than exercise, maybe."
15782.0,Patient,"Like my string and I like to say, like Hello."
760.0,Provider,"Oh, your string okay. yeah. Okay, would you like to learn some additional maybe more positive coping skills."
15782.0,Patient,Because I don't know.
760.0,Provider,You guess.
15782.0,Patient,I don't know if it is going to help. But my string making so good.
760.0,Provider,"I hear you it doesn't sound healthy to me i'm but i'm not going to sit here and tell you not to do it. But what I would like to do is just kind of suggest being open to the possibility Alexis that you can learn new things, and that maybe that doesn't have to be so important to you. If that makes some kind of sense like somehow your brain maybe through the trauma your brain has associated safety with the pillow with the strings ritual that you have. And so you know part of healing is is it's kind of a gradual process it's not something that's going to happen overnight. So trying new safer coping skills. you're looking a little frazzled or what are you feeling right now. Nothing you don't want to. frustrated. I like the deep breaths that you're taking that's a good coping skill. So you're feeling triggered to cry. it's okay to cry you want to say Okay, if you don't want to."
15782.0,Patient,Hello.
760.0,Provider,We talked about some mindfulness. Last time. You want to try some mindfulness exercises right now.
15782.0,Patient,what's that.
760.0,Provider,"Okay what's that I can send you a sheet on mindfulness as well. Very simple sheet I would you like me to send you these things in your email. Yes, okay. i'll send you the emotion sheet and the mindfulness sheet. What is mindfulness. mindfulness is a state of non judgmental awareness that's happening in the present moment, including of the awareness of one's own thoughts feelings and senses. it's you know kind of the opposite of trying to shove down my feelings i'm going to try what i'm going to try to do is acknowledge my feelings, even if i'm feeling hurt, even if i'm feeling disappointed or betrayed or whatever. The emotion is that I acknowledge that I allow myself to feel that and try to work towards a practice, and I know it's not something that you're going to get to overnight or instantly. But just you know, taking deep breaths telling myself things like. i'm feeling this way right now but emotions past emotions come and go, I will feel better at another moment. Do you have a reaction to that. there's this. Whatever you're feeling whatever you're thinking there's there's you know there's nothing wrong you're free in this session Alexis to. let's have an honest conversation just tell me what it is you're thinking and feeling this we're talking if I say something that doesn't ring true for you speak to me on it let's talk back."
15782.0,Patient,I don't know why I want to go where Am I sharing.
760.0,Provider,Did I tell you had to get rid of your strength.
15782.0,Patient,"Low but nobody wants me to use it, but this only thing I hopes."
760.0,Provider,"My suggestion was something different Do you remember what I suggest about it, rather than getting rid of it Alexis. Do you remember what I said. I said to start building additional coping skills so that perhaps that might start to fall away might find yourself needing it less because you have more healthy ways that help you feel better. there's a possibility just having a still thought in your head, maybe I can learn something else that doesn't cause marks or burns on my hands. that's all i'm asking. Is that a little bit better. Because you know. When people struggle with ptsd and perhaps just the mere thought of getting rid of my string just correct me if i'm receiving this round the lexus. But maybe that makes you feel a little bit unsafe, because you don't know how else to cope. When you think about that letting go of that is that is that what I sense. Okay. So. i'm starting right now to go over another program called seeking safety, the number one thing is to learn how to feel safe learn how to trust. and learn new ways so. that's, this is what i'm suggesting i'm we're talking about mindfulness so i'm asking you just to start using some mindfulness and and and."
15782.0,Patient,Add it.
760.0,Provider,to your to your daily routine and let's see how it works for you.
15782.0,Patient,And let's.
760.0,Provider,Talk about it. What was it. What was that.
15782.0,Patient,"People sometimes like people just doors for you, people are out to her. Okay. traceable approach problem, believing in people sometimes."
760.0,Provider,"yeah that's that's really common with people with people who struggle with ptsd maybe maybe somebody somebody in power betrayed betrayed them, maybe somebody close to them betrayed them and that's going to that's. You know when somebody's in a traumatic in the middle of a traumatic experience. They The first thing is survival, they have to stay safe and so maybe in maybe lack of ability to trust was important, back then, because it wasn't safe to certain people. Right and can your ptsd is that, like one time or ongoing trauma."
15782.0,Patient,All going on. yeah.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so of course it's normal you did the best you could Alexis back then to survive. And you learned, not to trust, because it was the best way for you to survive, then. Does that make sense. And it's still true there's a lot of people in this world Alexis that it would not be safe to trust. Okay, so it's a balance it's not about not trusting nobody. And it's not about trusting everybody it's the balance it's about trusting the people who are not toxic the people that are you know, and if that right now is just treatment, then that's what that is. And do you think that perhaps your mood shifts when you're out and about because maybe there's a fear of trusting or maybe maybe there's a fear of i'm letting my guard down too much something might happen to me. kind of you thought or feeling."
15782.0,Patient,More for will be too nice there gotta check more the focus cuz cuz cuz yeah yeah.
760.0,Provider,"Well, that being said, it's important to remove toxic people from our lives, when necessary, is there anybody in your environment that you."
15782.0,Patient,don't.
760.0,Provider,"You know don't feel safe with and when I say safe I don't mean just physically safe, I mean physically say emotionally say mentally say all of all three."
15782.0,Patient,emotional body for my environment. Emotionally. Every.
760.0,Provider,Everybody so so. Your brain is kind of wired to just i'm not even going to take a chance on trusting anybody.
15782.0,Patient,Well Hello be scared okay.
760.0,Provider,All right.
15782.0,Patient,"Give us make a show like that, but. Some people in too much because that's how they can destroy. Nobody wants the best for. Everybody the best food so."
760.0,Provider,"All right. So you think that there's literally nobody in the world, absolutely zero people that. don't have a care."
15782.0,Patient,"push come to shove, and when shit gets real you're not going to be on my side, the other side that's how it always has been, always will be. Okay."
760.0,Provider,"All right, I think you I think I asked you about your support system last time, and you said, can you refresh my memory about that was there anybody."
15782.0,Patient,Before like what.
760.0,Provider,Like emotional support somebody that you can turn to if you're feeling really low.
15782.0,Patient,or volleyball to ship people already think of. The five o'clock and tell them like even more like they'll probably stick up to fucking lunatic.
760.0,Provider,"yeah that's what I thought I just wanted, I just wanted to, I just wanted to verify that I was remembering right so. Okay, so, but you can do that here."
15782.0,Patient,"yeah that's what he says, who they're supposed to be, for nobody in the world, all fucked up in the head okay."
760.0,Provider,Well that's not the words I would choose. ptsd ptsd is something that happened to you it's not something you chose it's not something that. it's not something that is a weakness on your part. It developed out of the need to survive it's developed out of your strength to survive. And then it became habit. And entrenched in your thinking and in your emotions. Does that make sense it what it's not a weakness. it's not that your F up. Maybe what happened to you is what is F up. But you are not what happened to you. You are much bigger than that. What do you think about that.
15782.0,Patient,"Close or small me, and so I still feel welcome loss kid and yet so until. The last child oh."
760.0,Provider,"yeah healing is a process that's that's true that's that's very insightful on your part that last child needs to learn how to feel safe. so that she can move on. Because. you're still kind of there a lot of the time. makes sense. It okay let's let's talk a little bit more about mindfulness. Now i'm going to know a lot of these things that i'm asking you to do Alexis may sound card or even impossible. But i'm going to caution you to remember this is a process, this is a practice. it's not it's like when you're healing from ptsd it's like. it's like you're a little child children they're born, they have to learn how to hold up their head, they have to learn how to crawl they have to learn how to walk and there's a process to that and when you're healing from mental health. conditions, including ptsd that's kind of what you're doing. Does that make sense, so. Once thing that i'm going to ask you to do is to trust, a little bit that process trust the process and practice, it and let me know how it goes. And if you don't i'm not asking for you to agree with it i'm just asking you to try it. Okay. nothing to lose to try it worst thing that's going to happen is that you're not going to feel much better, maybe, maybe you'll feel better just by one or two points, maybe it'll take the anxiety to to a five from a seven penalty."
15782.0,Patient,The ranges of really bad right.
760.0,Provider,"yeah so so it let's let's start this again because we kind of got off track a little bit so mindful mindfulness is a state of non judgmental awareness that's happening in the present moment, including the awareness of one's own thoughts feelings and senses. So awareness during a state of mindfulness, you will notice your thoughts feelings and physical sensation as they happen, the goal isn't to clear your mind or to stop thinking it's to become aware of your thoughts and feelings, rather than getting lost in that. Okay, and then the next point is acceptance, the thoughts feelings and sensations that you notice should be observed in a non judgmental manner, for example, if you notice the feeling of nervousness simply say to yourself, I noticed that i'm nervous. there's no need to judge or change the feeling. Because that's a lot of times what we do to we start to feel really anxious, or we start to feel really angry and so we don't like to feel that nobody likes to feel those things, so we try to push it away and try to you know change it. Instead, you just you use your coping skills, you can take a deep breath you're going to practice mindfulness I notice i'm angry. And you allow yourself to feel that feeling. And maybe even going to tell yourself this anger pass. take a deep breath. Sometimes it's the fighting against the emotion Alexis. The need to defend against the emotion. it's just an emotion it's a normal human emotion. anger is not good or bad it's not right or wrong, it just feels bad. Our behavior and response to our anger can be destructive. Or it can be healing because we express it properly. So that makes sense. Okay. Okay, so some of the benefits of mindfulness would be reduced symptoms of Depression and anxiety greater satisfaction and relationships improved memory focus mental processing. Reduced rumination, which is the repeating going over and over in your mind the worry the concern all those things that the mind is like constantly ruminating on just doesn't like holds on to and builds up the anxiety, for instance. So it also improves your ability to adapt to stressful situations. and improved ability to manage emotions. Okay. So mindfulness is a state of mind it's not really a particular action or exercise, however, without practicing it. it's difficult to achieve, so you know kind of like being physically fit if you're if you're out of shape, you know, being in shape is a physical state, but you have to kind of. exercise, you have to go through the motions of exercising in order to become fit so that makes sense. Okay, so there's four different types of mindfulness these are very simple kind of to get started a little bit and mindfulness meditation. Then there's a body scan one. mindfulness walk are you are you in a safe environment, a lot of the time that you can go on walks. Okay, maybe on your days off or even if you're walking in the bus stop it still practice it as you're out I would try to do that and then there's five senses. let's let's do. Let me see. let's do a body scan a little bit. Okay. I don't know how you're sitting you don't look like you're leaning into your phone you don't need to do that. Once you. Sit straight. And once your two feet flat on the floor. Your legs should be like comfortable with your spine should be straight your arms, can you put them relaxed in your lap and both them and, like make them relaxed in your lap shoulders don't have to be too far back, but they don't want to be forward either. And you start by taking a deep breath. pay attention to your breathing. you're going to notice the physical sensations. You feel the air. notice the air as you breathe in through your nose. And out through your mouth. notice the temperature of the air. notice any smells in the air. And then you notice perhaps Alexis that there's some. Stress somewhere in your body note that, where is the stress in your body. You don't have to answer me right now just make a note of it. make a notice is it is it in your stomach. Is it in your neck. Then, maybe you might notice what you're feeling. And you might have a couple of thoughts going through your head that are uncomfortable or unpleasant in some way notice those. Other way, while knowing that emotions come and go. saying to myself i'm in i'm in the process of recovery. I mean in process appealing. Now, if your mind starts to wander notice your thoughts. feels comfortable come back and think about your breathing. Your posture is important. If you're feeling frustrated about something going to talk about that. And when you're ready when you're done and stop."
15782.0,Patient,I don't want to do this.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, because."
15782.0,Patient,stone.
760.0,Provider,Is it causing certain emotions that feel uncomfortable to you Alexis.
15782.0,Patient,relax so angry.
760.0,Provider,Oh can't relax because you got too much anger. Okay.
15782.0,Patient,So what is this.
760.0,Provider,"You don't have to want to do things some sometimes sometimes practices we try things. We try things because the other ways that are that we've been doing haven't worked for us fully, and so let me keep trying something because it's a practice. And I think feelings of resistance and ambivalence when we're dealing with really difficult things is a normal part of recovery Alexis. So I would ask you to if it's painful to you keep it super short. I don't want to add to your stress, like, I think, maybe I don't know what we were doing this for three four minutes, maybe. So maybe make it like two minutes. Or perhaps tried mindfulness well. try something else but let's try a different one let's do something a little bit less. let's do the five senses when. We make a conscious effort to notice the present moment, through your senses. first thing you're going to do is you're going to look around the room and you're going to name five random things it's no wrong answer five things I see. Four things you feel. know the physical physically things like I feel."
15782.0,Patient,cold.
760.0,Provider,chilly the cold okay. Maybe you feel the Chair you're sitting on I don't know what you're sitting on maybe it's a SOFA.
15782.0,Patient,yeah so Look how much did it on me.
760.0,Provider,feel okay how about your feet flat on the floor.
15782.0,Patient,Across all angry.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so I feel my feet cross together."
15782.0,Patient,yeah my feet are crossed.
760.0,Provider,And then maybe you feel the fabric of your shirt.
15782.0,Patient,yeah so my elbow.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, good. Three things you here."
15782.0,Patient,"i'm here, I have my friend walk around. dogs."
760.0,Provider,And one thing you smell.
15782.0,Patient,I smell fresh air. Okay.
760.0,Provider,"Is that. A little bit better maybe you like the five senses, maybe that would be better for you to start with that or perhaps some mindfulness walk kind of hard to do on a zoom call. But if you're going to do the mindfulness walk what you're going to do is you're going to. you're going to notice how your body moods you're going to pay attention we don't pay attention when we bought we just walk them know think about the way our feet deal but you're going to pay attention to. You know the things you see as you're walking you're going to pay attention to the ground, or maybe the pavement or a car, whatever it is you're walking on. you're going to notice the way your legs feel the way your feet feel inside your shoes those kinds of things. And then you can expand to things that's just see things hear. Things you feel it's not your emotions feeling it's more like physical kind of sensation feeling like if it's a cool day I feel the cool air. If it's hot day I feel the hot sun, I feel my my i'm sweating I feel the sweat dripping down my face things like that."
15782.0,Patient,The five senses help like to help me relax a little more.
760.0,Provider,"Okay let's let's let's move into meditation a little bit and the body scan a little bit more. And I think perhaps what's happening for you is that, when we repress our emotions we're holding those emotions in some part of our body. Do you know where what part of the body you're holding it in."
15782.0,Patient,i'm popping my shoulders and my neck okay.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so you can be aware of that that's good to be aware of yeah there's there's some mindfulness right there and some exercise and some stretches. Okay, so let's start with those two i'm going to when we get off i'm going to email you these two sheets and and you can focus on the mindfulness walk in this five senses and I do. If you feel resistance, I just want to remind you and caution you that it's kind of normal there's a. There might be a. You know, especially the side of you that feels I can't trust that maybe I can't even trust, a new process kind of thought. So i'm asking you to find safe areas, to start with little changes so that you can start to learn to take some baby steps towards getting better with these mental health issues. And, just like just like a child learns how to you know hold up their head to have a crawl have a walk then they run and then they're just going and it's the recovery is a lot like that. And in the beginning it's always harder and you have to think more about it. And you feel tense about it don't talk to me what's your feeling."
15782.0,Patient,Just for the.
760.0,Provider,US you want to get help.
15782.0,Patient,Should. Be so self so pocket a result I. That it the whole world.
760.0,Provider,"Remember what we talked about anger anger comes and anger calls. I think when we struggle with ptsd we live with, maybe we're carrying more anger than if we didn't have that. Right. But still anger comes and go you're not going to be angry every second of the rest of your life. Maybe it's going to be far more often than you want a spike but is that fair there's moments you don't feel anger. And it's okay it's okay to be angry you don't have to fight against being angry it's it's you, you can learn how to express it assertively. normal human emotion nothing wrong with anger it just doesn't. It just feels bad. Okay hey. All right. Was this helpful to you today."
