13607.0,Patient,I know you're super busy.
298.0,Provider,that's okay i'm happy to see you. How can I help you today.
13607.0,Patient,"Well i've been having like issues with my refills. uh huh and they're telling me that I had to do some classes, which are. Some surveys and stuff and i've been doing them, but then, when I call the the writing to get a refill they seem to have a shortage. And so, then I go like two three days without so, then I start filling up withdrawals like really kicking my butt and the anxiety, the cold sweats I start feeling like crap I can function can take care of my baby, which is the worst part, so it doesn't help with my anxiety or anything. So I don't know what else I could do or."
298.0,Provider,"Okay. Are you coming, are you keeping all your appointments as it's a mistake on my part. Or is it the pharmacy part. Or is it you not."
13607.0,Patient,"hurt they short me and then I have to wait until they get their stuff and then, and then I can't get in or whatever, and then. I don't know I don't know if it's going to work with me not being able to keep up with what I have to be doing with this program. Or if it's also well I know it's a pharmacy for sure, because they've been charted me on my medication and then they say I could get the refills, then I have to call you guys again, because then they when they do call together refill they don't have them so, then I don't know."
298.0,Provider,"So I can give you my email address, and you can email me if it's a problem, but if you. The pharmacy doesn't have the medicine, then you need to find another pharmacy that does have the medicine and then you need to call the virtual clinic and let them know what that pharmacy is I can't change the pharmacy in our system."
13607.0,Patient,Okay okay.
