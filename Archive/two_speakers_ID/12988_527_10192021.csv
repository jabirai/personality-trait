12988.0,Patient,Just like being there and seeing everything and.
527.0,Provider,yeah.
12988.0,Patient,"I had a little. episode. Knowing that I have to heal a lot and I got really overwhelmed with everything and I got really, really bad and. Okay, I hated that and so i've been missing a lot of the fine man for forgetting so much stuff I work like oh my God. OK OK."
527.0,Provider,"that's okay So what do we need to do destiny like do you need to kind of prioritize things for yourself, or is there an areas, you can kind of set some limits or."
12988.0,Patient,"yeah I need to slow my mind. i'm starting to write things down on my calendar now so every Tuesday at noon it's going to go off like make sure if I can't make it on Wednesday, I call and I let them know that I have. That alarm now. And then i'm starting to make alarms to start kind of help myself and give myself some grace period I can get better."
527.0,Provider,Okay yeah.
12988.0,Patient,I was gonna say.
527.0,Provider,"And how how, in advance, do you know your schedule like Do you know what a week, at a time."
12988.0,Patient,"Sometimes from. It i'll know like if I went in today, I know this whole week because i'm working on a case study. But usually we kind of play it day by day, so. I know. yeah."
527.0,Provider,"Later, that day yeah that kind of makes it a little tricky because I was going to say. What you could do what i've done with some of my other people is they're going to call like on Sunday or Monday to the virtual clinic and just get their appointments for the week you know whether it's. They have and and so, so they can just do it a week, at a time and stay on top of it and try not to miss thing. You know, try to keep themselves on their schedule so. But if yours changes day to day, then. That makes it a little more challenging, I think, maybe i'll be able to do that meeting in November, because."
12988.0,Patient,"I know i'm working with a dietitian and her schedule is shortened hours. She most reschedule okay. i'm waiting for reply. So hopefully the month of November, the dietitian i'm working with. This month is very I don't know how she's working. she's very sporadic."
527.0,Provider,"Yes, that makes it hard so tell me how you're doing with grandpa."
12988.0,Patient,"Okay, he. He moved away a couple years back, and when him and like grandma got divorced. I was really sad that they got divorced, but. You know she she wasn't happy and she wanted, and she deserve happiness and so. He would always text me here and there, and you'd see all the things on Facebook and just text me that he was proud of me. Like had. It wasn't covered related he did have diabetes. And he loved. His Coca Cola."
527.0,Provider,yeah.
12988.0,Patient,"And it was diabetes related, unfortunately. Okay, and he passed away coming on July 16. yeah it was very unexpected and. It was very shocking and it was it was hard it, I want to like the text messages and I was really sad that I wasn't gonna get anymore. it's just he was expected to live a lot longer, but he he didn't take care of themselves and that was about really hard. yeah and doing a lot better now but at that time it was it was really difficult because there was my mom was having a hard time too, because I heard that."
527.0,Provider,Sure yeah. yeah yeah.
12988.0,Patient,"I never had a death quote like that close in the family. Okay, I was kind of Dreading it."
527.0,Provider,"yeah it's hard. it's hard and you experience that. First, you know close family member that passes yeah it's definitely hard."
12988.0,Patient,"yeah and I don't know how to react or do I never been through that. i'm like. A roller coaster it is, it is, and I think that's just pretty common and natural to."
527.0,Provider,"You know grief is just a process and it's you know you go through a lot of different emotions initially and and for you it's also like wow, this is the first person close to me that's passed away too, so those emotions, on top of it as well. yeah yeah it's just going to take some time, and I think you know as much as you need to talk through it or cry or be mad or you know, think about the happy memories like it's you know all of it's okay to do."
12988.0,Patient,"yeah yeah I know he's doing better so much better if I know he was really was hard of hearing and. I know he can hear everything there. And it was always hard to talk to him, I want to learn sign language to help. yeah he was a really good man was really awesome. very humble person. But. The other week, I was so ashamed about it. Last Monday last Monday I was going through like this crisis and. You know, going with my grandpa I want to be better because he he was always. Living his life for other people. Because he was such a humble person and but he didn't live it for himself and I. I want, I want to be, I want to do that I want. to live. So myself and he really got me thinking and I love my grandpa I claimed."
527.0,Provider,That.
12988.0,Patient,"I just I don't I I kept it at the bottom, and I want to. kind of like I need a list of things that I needed to heal from. Who seen the list and going through it, I saw that there was a lot. And then I got really sad Friday was a lot and i'm like Lord should be the opposite, but I got so down and. depressed about it, that there was so much stuff that I went through, and I mean, of course, these people who have read through worse things but. I had a lot of trauma and. I look back then I suffered with a lot of suicidal thoughts and I promised myself method to go through that again, but that day I was going to do that again and I was even more ashamed, I was feeling that way of thinking that way I haven't been for years."
527.0,Provider,"Okay okay what what helped you through that day, like, I obviously you recognize those thoughts was there any any plans or intentions with the thoughts."
12988.0,Patient,"No, no, I OK, I know I won't do that because I thought of my sister's a lot and I know it's horrible to think that but. they're so young, they wouldn't they wouldn't didn't want. Sure anyone to think that be for them."
527.0,Provider,yeah.
12988.0,Patient,"And we will got Community they always are so excited to see me and if I was going to be with you like, why that's awful."
527.0,Provider,sure.
12988.0,Patient,"I hate it, but I mean it shouldn't it shouldn't model, but I don't like it my boyfriend really helped me go through with it, but you're out of it."
527.0,Provider,"Okay, I."
12988.0,Patient,"wanted to do it myself, but he really did help me."
527.0,Provider,"Good good yes it's definitely hard to reach out for support, but it's. You know, sometimes you have to allow yourself that."
12988.0,Patient,"yeah yeah and he he really. taught me, and it was embarrassing cuz I don't like to show that side. Okay it's all. I don't want to show people that I don't like that I always like to be strong and I can do it and and I just felt very low that day. And he really helped me, we were talking a lot about it. And he knows that he added to. The stress and in the added trauma he felt really bad and he was telling me that he doesn't want me to feel this way at all to be would be so devastating just so happened. That if if we need to take a break and I move on find someone who makes me really happy, like you, I love you and I don't want to leave you, but I messed up. And I need to be happy, I want you to be happy okay don't do anything with that and that made me really it was really sweet of her to say but. I do want to make it work and he's like i'm trying everything, but I must stop them if I messed up so that that that I just are robbing V not be. It was just. It was just a lot that day. I wanted to. I just want to make sure that I I mattered I I was a huge deal for me not I i'm very thoughtful and consider a people's emotions and their feelings. And I don't do certain things, because that might hurt their feelings, they may not like that, and I take a lot of things into consideration and sometimes. If I didn't if I hurt someone's feelings i'm very like oh my gosh I didn't think that i'm so sorry it will never happen again, and then it will never happen again. And then I hated that you know going through all my whole life I was horribly abused my my dogs ex girlfriend just because I was my mom's daughter, you know. I was a kid Why would you do that, to someone Why would you do that, to a child, why would you hit them and take them, I was a person, and I was severely bullied. I was a person like Why would you tell me things and tell me that it didn't matter that I if I was alive or not like I have feelings and emotions and. I felt like I didn't matter and that's when I struggled a lot with suicide, a lot of kids told me I didn't matter. And then you know going through the whole dating thing I was always the second girl, I was never enough to be. Your first choice or always always hit in and bought me feel even worse, not mattering to someone when I finally went through the first suicide phase of i'll be better everything will be better. And then I made horrible choices and lost my friends, and then I got sexually assaulted and then this with my boyfriend I got really down. I thought, everything was going to turn around the corner felt like a pop. And I I was really sad that. What my my sexual assault I I want it, I said no, a lot. yeah my voice didn't matter. What my fault and I told him I didn't want to be cheating on ever again to always always suspected girl and and with this thought like I can handle it, but then my words that matter again cuz he did it. And it was it was just. I. fell, I think it matters. yeah yeah and I got really frustrated. I don't know someone to cheat someone like that and I thought really attract and they really sad, he said that like I didn't matter that he he just had a problem, and he had issues that he was like he. He was scared to get into relationship, remember, I told her unexpectedly, he was really scared to get in a relationship in there, we have issues that he had to work on. He wanted to stop he couldn't. Because it was a problem that wasn't me. And I don't know sometimes. I still struggle with that, but. Sure i've been trying to be more positive."
527.0,Provider,"yeah yeah sounds like a lot of a lot of things kind of surface this last week for you. yeah well, and you know, I think that happens destiny, a lot of times when you get so overloaded with things I mean you are super busy with. school and we're in. therapy and you. know all kinds, you know, trying to do relationships and then your. grandfather passes away. Like that's. you've had a lot of things like happen in the last couple weeks just kind of compiled on each other, but you know what prompted you to kind of explore that list for yourself like."
12988.0,Patient,"hey. I know there's a lot of things from my past that I needed to heal from and I realized that I based my happiness. My boyfriend was that Michael. was my happiness and. When I met him and we got together, I was I kind of had like this sigh of relief right now I can be happy. And chest someone. and not be heard anymore, and I put a shouldn't put so much and that person to the person. is not perfect now make mistakes and I need to be happy within myself. And I realized I had. All I was like this doing a lot of research and. It sounded like that was really cool dependent on him Okay, I do have abandonment issues, I had a lot of friends and. I always had a fear of them, leaving because when I moved away, I was alone, and I have a fear of being alone. I moved from town to town. I have like these weird of abandonment being alone issues I don't like being alone I can't do it and. And I realize, I was worried codependent on him I was really codependent on one of my best friends, before I moved to cal poly so. I finally figured it switched over to him and I needed to work on stuff I needed to heal that way I if if anything happens if i'm trying to make it work and he's doing an amazing job on keeping his promises on his end. I need to just focus. I don't have to forgive at this time, at this moment, the focus on myself, so I can be better and not be in this dark hole all the time. So, then, I was like okay let's try to figure out where this came from this is from somewhere, so I that's when I started writing writing down all the things that you're from and my I know I pushed aside, because I don't like feeling. When I saw the list I got really sad and my goal my body there's like a pattern."
527.0,Provider,Why okay okay. yeah yeah yeah what was what was the pattern.
12988.0,Patient,"I a chest. chest so much, I trust, a lot of people I trust. very openly and. I love their. Other people's way of thinking about me affect me so much i'd be happy to like either have to like why don't be like me why don't they do this and. And I realized all those other times I stand up for myself, because I. I was very shy and not. And they took advantage. And that's what I saw that's when that's when I went down the whole rabbit hole of like why don't I matter, a person like that."
527.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
12988.0,Patient,hey.
527.0,Provider,"You know, and I know that took a lot for you to be able to write that out for yourself but i'm glad that you definitely explored that and recognized. You know that i'm i'm putting some walls up to letting myself heal and find my voice, because yeah you you do matter destiny like and the things that have happened, you know we're not I mean you, you were a kid you're like those things shouldn't have happened like. You didn't deserve those things to happen to you. And you do need to find your worth and all of this. yeah be able to and be able to stand firm with your voice and what your needs and wants are for yourself and with others."
12988.0,Patient,"it's very hard, because I never had that background or that voice when my mom. has done a lot she's she's learned a lot, I mean she was young. I know, back then, before parenting back then, if I said something that was talking about, so I never. Sure anything, because it can anybody in my mom now with my other sister joy is that, like it's not talking back it's just yeah their emotion and i'm really glad that she's doing that. And because I really don't have a backbone. I never thought I had a check stolen from me and I didn't say anything. And how phone stolen from me and things happen and i'm just like oh yeah. And they need to say something I need. To be just don't know how."
527.0,Provider,"Well, and I think you have to look at to like that's how you learn to cope with things too and and and your experiences. Just kept shutting that voice down and getting softer and softer and and already challenging how you feel about yourself, and so you know, sometimes we find ourselves in situations that aren't healthy because we kind of. that's kind of how we feel about ourselves, like that's just what that's just what happens to me that's what I deserve like that's just how life falls for me and. And so i'm glad to hear that you're wanting and willing to look at that for yourself and change that and go, you know what I do matter and i'm going to start standing up for myself and learning how to do that with people and and for myself, most importantly."
12988.0,Patient,"yeah yeah i'm really tired of it i'm tired of. not saying anything. i'll do have the motion, it does suck. At both your stuff up. And that I really I really had a weak moment and a low moment that day, but I. Sure, I really want to turn it around and try to hear from those things, and the michaels doing really great and I can't rely on him for my happiness, I have to be happy with myself and being okay with being alone and there's nothing wrong with that. He was actually getting this new job. he's working with his brother he's doing like these 12 hour shifts. With it was like it's like 18 per hour and then over time he wants to provide a house or an apartment with that. But and I thought that was really sweet and he's like i'm willing to dedicate half my days. Trying to support both of us, because I want to be the man that you deserve, I want to be mature and be American about it and not waste my time watching things and and there's no point out that does it benefit me a life. I love. hearing that and and he's going to be having this 12 hour days and I have an issue about being alone like we're not going to do very well and. I can't rely he's going to be exhausted I can't rely on one person and if I don't rely on him oh my family but they're doing their own thing my mom is super busy my dad is working on it. And I can't rely on other people to bring this joy and happiness Okay, I have to find that myself. Okay i'm really trying to do that at the moment. yeah that's my current homework is. To find a routine and week you know, but you know getting my life organized because we've been so disorganized very like rosling."
527.0,Provider,"yeah yeah in in when life is kind of chaotic that makes it hard to like figure out, you know. Where where to even start sometimes and so it's just like. kind of like just throwing your hands up like just forget it like I it's too much it's I don't even know where to start with this pile of organization. of things, I have to do."
12988.0,Patient,"i'm getting all nervous. My boyfriend does smoke. And he's been giving me a little bit. And I don't want to get dependent on it, because I have a fear of addiction addiction runs in my family."
527.0,Provider,"Yes, yep."
12988.0,Patient,"And so i'm highly aware of it, but I have been doing it more and it helps me feel so much more calmer, and I feel like it's not normal but it helps me focus on. I. Whenever i'm sober and i'm so my brain feels like a giant wire, or just weird things and I don't do and. I just sit there and think about all the things I need to do. And then I sit there all day and do nothing, and then. If I smoke with him and then i'm like Okay, I have to finish this, this will be easier to finish i'll do it, and then I am more productive and I feel like it's not healthy. To be productive on that, because then I don't understand like how it can help with my. I don't want it to basically as I don't want it to wobble but I know a lot of people use that for. I like more medical issues if you have arthritis or cancer and he. had every right to use that for pain, but. I don't want it's not, I know, usually it's used for to be calm."
527.0,Provider,And relaxed and.
12988.0,Patient,not think but it helps me to think more and linear. And I thought.
527.0,Provider,"Well yeah if. It slows your thought processes damn destiny, so what it's doing it's. it's slowing things down so you can think more clearly as far as what. You know what you need to do next like it's not like it's not like a hamster on a wheel like going, you know 50 miles an hour your your wheels slowing down so then your your thoughts are here's here's more of my thoughts like. yeah and then. Trying. To tackle them one, at a time. But yeah you definitely have to be cautious with the addiction in your family too, but I also think it's very clear like how overwhelmed you're feeling right now. you're trying to find. Things to manage your emotions, excuse me. Your emotions and that overwhelming feeling so. I think just being. being very cautious of that for yourself."
12988.0,Patient,"yeah, I am very adamant on alone. If I really need it for the day then i'll do very little to help me be productive and get more work done but. For sleep I don't sleep that much anymore. I."
527.0,Provider,can't sleep.
12988.0,Patient,"And it's so hard to sleep to my brain is like you can do. Yes, and I helps me sleep. Okay, I can actually sleep and more and more time and not by get three or four."
527.0,Provider,"yeah what medications are you on right now destiny, are you on anything."
12988.0,Patient,And currently just found birth control. and iron. But that's about it.
527.0,Provider,"Okay, I didn't think you were on any psychiatric medications so."
12988.0,Patient,"Okay, makes me a little nervous."
527.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
12988.0,Patient,i'm not too knowledgeable on that stuff and be couldn't be in nutrition major I know a lot of more horrific stuff so that other things i'm like I don't know.
527.0,Provider,yeah.
12988.0,Patient,Not more carefully but.
527.0,Provider,"You know, it might just be worth scheduling an appointment with chantel just to talk about kind of what you're feeling right now, sometimes medications can. In and I certainly understand your hesitancy i'm not pushing medications, but I also know that sometimes medications can help. Like short, you know for a short period of time, while you're working through things with therapy like to be able to kind of be another tool to help help you progress like think a little clear manage your emotions, a little bit more. In so you know it might just be worth having a conversation with her to see you know our medications would medications be helpful or. Do we want to just continue trying to incorporate some you know other additional tools like you know trying, you know to. do some maybe journaling before bedtime or some meditation or relaxation or some you know what maybe some like melatonin or trezza don't that can help with sleep, which are non addictive medications. and You know, and you don't have to take them necessarily every night either they you can take them as needed. As well melatonin is over the counter. In the pharmacy so it's, not even a prescription medication so. So yeah there might be some other options to explore, but I think definitely you've brought a lot of things to the surface today to destiny that that you that you're aware okay. i'm starting to have some feelings and remember remember some things that i've not been addressing for myself and so that may be part of it too that's gotten your sleep and your schedules just kind of all over the place, too, so. yeah so it's definitely making it. Much more challenging for you to get the rest that you need."
12988.0,Patient,But yeah yeah.
527.0,Provider,"yeah so it's just something to think about destiny and you know if you feel like that's a conversation, you may want to have with chantel just to explore things. were asked questions, certainly, you know schedule a time for her but we're definitely going to start unpacking some of this stuff that you're carrying and and. really try to figure out how we can process through that for you that's going to be most helpful and and heal some of those you know hurts and traumas that you've experienced you."
12988.0,Patient,are going to be a ride.
527.0,Provider,"yeah well I think it's been easier and and I know we've talked a lot about Michael, but I think it's been easier for you to kind of deflect it, you know, on on him versus really. Having to dig into what you're in. And I tried to bring it back to you like, but you know that's that's an easy distraction, is to focus on him and his stuff. yeah. yeah but it definitely and it's not that it's not impacting you we definitely have to address it, but it's it's triggering some of those unresolved things for you as well. yeah yeah. yeah. We have to look at all of it together so where are things with him and you like. guys still together you guys taken a break or."
12988.0,Patient,"Wishing together, and I feel like after everything if we're doing a lot more, better. i'm trying to not be as controlling and and not of course I have my anxieties me helps you helps her those he's very understanding and. But i'm shy can't i'm trying to tell myself I can't control him I can't control what he does, I can't control, if you disrespect me or not like that's his choice and not. His own doing, and he does that again, but just shows a lot, so that not only that it's just not a problem but. I don't I don't need to be a part of that if I don't want to and. Just to kind of let go and allow him to show them what how. You feel and how much he means this and I shown to just have so much on my plate, and so much things i'm doing internally. And i'm like honestly I should I should just let that go. That way, I can focus on healing other parts of myself. Okay i'll be a constant, what are you doing checking my phone texting, and what are you doing what do you do you know. do that and, eventually, if anything is happening will always show itself it's not. likely to be hit again ever that's a fear and minus how if you hide it so well, and I never find it i'd be so chat but eventually it will but. yeah I can't I can't worry about I can't stress that. He has to just work on himself and worry about himself at the moment. that's, all I can do from trying to have healthy boundaries."
527.0,Provider,"Okay, good good. don't only."
12988.0,Patient,not be too crazy.
527.0,Provider,"Yes, exactly. Exactly well, I want to make sure we've got some appointments scheduled destiny So yes, because this was our last one we had scheduled it looks like."
12988.0,Patient,"yeah. I think um last time, when I talked to the dietitian she's kind of hard to get Ahold of. Her she's willing to pay but she did say that she was having a shortened hours and was only working Monday. Tuesday and Wednesday and i'll probably have Thursday, Friday open. showing you can try those face first and i've been indeed."
