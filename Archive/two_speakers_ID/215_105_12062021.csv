215.0,Patient,We were ringers off.
105.0,Provider,"All right, so any major life changes going on."
215.0,Patient,"um let's see. Well, my health hasn't been great good lately um. So it's been stressing me out a lot. um i'm having a lot of problems. With my periods. Okay, so yeah I wasn't the emergency room on Thursday I am i'm just going to this, they were like like i'll skip a period. And then i'll get it like times 10 like two months later. yeah. And it's like. to the point where this last time I was using the you know very big huge oversized has an employee through like 10 minutes. yeah so I went to the er on Thursday and my blood counts were low, so I was being monitored and I had to had to get a movie and it's just been a blast. So they did do the ultrasound again and they're suggesting that the fibroid that I have on my wall be removed because it is causing a lot of problems. But man this thing is really messing me up."
105.0,Provider,How many months has this been going on.
215.0,Patient,"Probably sounds like the beginning of the year. And I think this last time, not only was it affected me that way, but just like. Emotionally. It was going insane. Like my moods or up and down and all around. I can have some days, where everything was pissing me off, and some days, where I was fine but yeah it's just it's been like a roller coaster."
105.0,Provider,I imagine it feels good to have a bit of a diagnosis here so you've got a plan.
215.0,Patient,"yeah because, even at first, when I was going to Presbyterian the first time I went for this, they were just kind of like yeah you know we'll do some tests and the latest like phony others little fiber optic but you know it's benign so blah blah blah. And then it happens all over again it's like well. I got like a little frustrated so, then I caught the make an appointment they're like yeah we're about you know, two months out and i'm like i'll be dead by then, but. The rain i'm going."
105.0,Provider,to bleed out.
215.0,Patient,"yeah like laid out here dude. So one of my co workers my office manager she she's like I have to be worried she's like and I went to a different person so she gave me that information. Okay, and they were much more helpful because I talked with her and she's like for what she was like I need you soon as we're done with this conversation she's like you need to get to the er she was like that's too much."
105.0,Provider,yeah.
215.0,Patient,"yeah that's a week and she's like then we're going to see you on Wednesday, rather than in January with Presbyterian so. she's like i'll work with the er and i'll you know communicate back and forth with them as to what they're finding when you go over there today she's like yeah and then that way I can use out for wednesday's appointment, so they seem to be more helpful. which has been a lot worse, you know relieving but. that's kind of pretty much the only thing that's been messing with me lately. Other regular things you know kids all that stuff."
105.0,Provider,Matters I mean your family is very central in your life it's it's important how are those relationships.
215.0,Patient,"Well, with with my youngest we seem to be having a little. clashing inside the House because Robert my fiance. Is a real um I would say he is just he's like a spitting image of my dad. Oh yeah right he's real. You know he's on it, you know he doesn't like foolishness he doesn't like bad things like respect and you know he's just a manly man. And when he doesn't feel like you're getting that then it's just been kind of like a roller coaster with that too, and I never talked to with my mom about this recently because I told her, I was like I feel again it between. You know. having to be mom also having to do it right, because you know you know I brought the he doesn't need to respect Roberts wishes as well, and I feel like they haven't put in cages right back down in the middle. So I had to even just talk with my mom about answers like well, you have to do what's right like I know our first instinct or to. You know, protect our children she's like but not what it's you know not right she's like you have to you have to put your foot down as well it's like and if you're not making sure that they're respecting Robert then it's not work out. Not spam yikes. I had a big blow out because of that."
105.0,Provider,"How could I be helpful, with that."
215.0,Patient,"You know. I think I mean I know what I have to do when it comes to that situation because. Like everything that I look at that you know, Robert quest are not bad things are. Legitimate things you know what I mean they're they're not something that's crazy. I just I think I am I need to be more. on it when it comes with with the kids because they do tend to her over me sometimes we've gone over this plenty of times. I need to stay on track. Even without ella even Alice she's 18 like even taught melodies like like she doesn't do anything to help you out around the House like at all. it's like that, then I hear them like you know talking back every once in a while he was like no it's not okay. But I know you and I have discussed this many times before, and I think I just need to. I need to stop stopping. Because seems like guys start with that you know, like. Making sure you know, the you know. consequences of their actions, be carried out."
105.0,Provider,Right.
215.0,Patient,And then I don't.
105.0,Provider,inconsistency.
215.0,Patient,"Your end exactly. I need to be more consistent. With you know, keeping up with them and their behaviors and just things they need to be doing around the House and. And when that doesn't happen, I need to make sure I follow through. You know, with consequences."
105.0,Provider,What is proper asking for.
215.0,Patient,"So. Daniel we love and it's so crazy, because it was exactly one year ago sink time. Robert when it is true, because Daniel tends toward his tools which would bug any man. Right any man that's any man and then Robert goes in his room to find them and then find this thing as well, which this last this last year was pipes and empty. wax models not. up to date and all the weed terms, these days, went from like all these crazy, you know regular we to all these crazy things so I don't know what what is what."
105.0,Provider,Some paraphernalia.
215.0,Patient,"Yes, exactly so but they're empty empty bottles meaning he's done them. Right now, and I remember specifically has told them many times before, do not bring stuff like that and to our whole he's like you know we don't allow it first off we don't allow it, and I don't either. Okay, so first off we don't even allow. Now discussion was between Robert tonight we. don't always have our eyes on the kids at all times okay so. I know I did it when I was younger when my parents weren't looking. You know, you said you know just don't do it, but especially don't bring nothing into our home I don't like it."
105.0,Provider,What do you. Think about think about what you're saying why especially don't bring it in the phone.
215.0,Patient,"Like disrespecting like it's just you know first off you're breaking the rule by doing it because we're asking you not to. And then you're being even more disrespectful by bringing into our home. You know he's like I don't you know your mom and I don't bring drugs into our home and we're not you know disrespecting our kids in that way, so let's all have same you know be on the same page. can do it don't break stuff into our home and he's doing both so. First, and this happened last thanksgiving. Robert and I were actually fighting last thanksgiving because of this. And then, when he goes off, and you know you know, he says punishment, then I need to be I need to have his back and what you told me last time, like last time he said no TV no playstation no fault. He knew the rules and him. He did it so no TV no playstation mobile phone. And then. I didn't. You know, impose the no TV things so he was you know upset with me that I didn't have his back on all three items. wish last year, like I said we solved and I learned a you know I apologize, I should have had his back with all three things and I allowed him to watch TV and I shouldn't go. So. We know we solve that one, and you know we ended up taking all three things away from him and then he earned his trust to get them back you know month later. And so we gave this stuff back and then this time exactly the same time last year same thing and it's always because we start to decorate and Roberts looking for his stuff and. He goes in rob Daniels room and the same thing we find the empty box, I mean like a shoe box like you're trying to hide it. I was saying stuff. And he said okay. Again, no. No TV no playstation and. No phone. and I asked Robert I said this time I said, well, can we at least have him have his phone while he's at school. Because he's at work, and then we just take it back after this because I do need to communicate with him. He has bound practice, and he has to notify my you know I sent my mom when he was done so that he can be picked up. And then of course out when he goes to work so Robert was it wasn't too happy about it, but I asked you know, can we at least let him keep us from that and he wasn't too happy about it. So, Nice and you know I, I would like to be included. And you know what the consequences are. And that's where we were bumping heads, this time around."
105.0,Provider,it's interesting you're his parent and you're saying include me.
215.0,Patient,"yeah exactly so that's how I that's exactly how I felt and that's how I told them like and that's where the big fight went down because I told like you're deciding these punishments. Without me. Like we should discuss them first. And then you know, let him know what they're going to be not you discussed them and then I just have to read with it, you know what I mean. So that's what the fight was about this time. And that's exactly like how you just had that time I felt. Like um I also like i'm i'm the mom here. i'm also going to decide what the consequences are."
105.0,Provider,How long has it been. That Robert has been the disciplinarian.
215.0,Patient,"Well, since last year, like when because this happened a couple times before, that were Danielle bras a fan and. Just be told me couldn't do it he's still doing it so then he asked to be involved with it, you know, last year, which I didn't disagree to it's both of our homes and he's not you know i'm not wrong. But I chose to include him in that."
105.0,Provider,Are there times when Robert disciplines and does not include you over this last year.
215.0,Patient,"You know they don't believe so, I we haven't really had any situations to where it would come down to that. So this was kind of that one situation and then he kind of just like was like this is this, this is a mess of those going to happen. And i'm like, no, no, I know, like, I want to be involved and here is what my opinions are, and this is what i'm going to need out of this because I do need to communicate with my kid. yeah, whether you like it or not. So that's kind of where we were."
105.0,Provider,Is it still in conflict or did you work it out.
215.0,Patient,"You know. We worked it out, but It just seems like. there's still like tension there."
105.0,Provider,"So the specifics have to do with Oh well, he doesn't get a data phone he gets a flip phone you went go minutes on it there's an idea."
215.0,Patient,"that's what he said to so he was like Okay, because Daniel just bought phone it just bought him a new iPhone because he's been working downtown. uh huh so we finally got him on the job for us, you know if you want nice things you're going to have to go get, though. I don't even have iPhone so I sure as hell man, what about you one. and which you did and and I even remember as a kid like, even though I lot of things my dad was like I don't care if you bought it i'm still taking it away. Whether you bought it with your paycheck or not you're still honor my home his daughter my supervision and my care so if I take it away that's just too damn bad. So, Robert was like Okay, well then, why don't we put the iPhone on your we can switch the numbers two years and then you can give down to your phone because I just have my simple little phone. And I just thought it was just too late, I don't know. that's what my like i'm just like well I don't want to have to call and change numbers and then change them back Daniel is on a you know, a financing time I sure shane going to take over it. So that's where our conflict was yeah."
105.0,Provider,"So that's one where you just buy a flip phone hold his and he can communicate with just this thing you got from walgreens. yeah the little bit less than what you're doing yours is a big that's a big change to to switch to a phone number, with a phone."
215.0,Patient,"Yes, see."
105.0,Provider,"This other. More said. Just a little little bit of data on there, that would be quite uncomfortable for him yeah so so that's just going content for a second."
215.0,Patient,"yeah that would be more of an idea, you know, an easier thing to do, on my end."
105.0,Provider,So.
215.0,Patient,i'll hold your phone until. I says is on us kid I got to tell me crazy.
105.0,Provider,"But there's also things like. Drugs screening, have you made a decision that it doesn't make sense to. Tell him randomly i'm going to be, and you may only budget in your head, you may say i'm going to test you once a week and he's always going to wonder, but really you buy one for $23 once a month, but he's thinking it could be any day now."
215.0,Patient,I haven't thought about that actually. Go and they actually have the little. The. tests at the dollar tree for a book for but it's just for thc. yeah it's not for everything it's not the whole drug panel.
105.0,Provider,But what you can do is you can do that right he'll get it in his head that it's going to happen and using one that has a little probably the one that you're getting I don't know i'm just assuming the one from the dollar store I haven't heard about their reliability their validity. But the ones you might spend $7 on per cup would probably be a little bit. yeah more you could trust it.
215.0,Patient,More yeah that's true.
105.0,Provider,"So that it's listen, this is, this is what we do you know we can't watch you all the time we I want to give you the ability to have more independence but just know this is how we're going to go about it intermittently and if it test positive. You know, then these things are going to happen."
215.0,Patient,"So actually I don't know why Robert and I haven't thought about that um but you kind of just like give me like this big light bulb in my head okay like because at this point i'm just like like what is, what are we gonna do. To get to the point where he we can't trust him enough to get given his stuff back."
105.0,Provider,So over.
215.0,Patient,"Again i'm like in my head. i'm thinking, what are we gonna take to get there again because he's already burned that bridge once."
105.0,Provider,"It takes about depends on it's very tricky thc stays in fact for about 45 days if you've been doing it quite a bit things like cocaine is 2448 hours 72 most opiates also short, they metabolize quickly they're out of your system. But if you've been doing thc for a minute, it can sit in your fat and it's released sort of but after 45 days there's no good reason I mean unless this kid was smoking all day every day. It would take. So is going to be gone for you, if it's true what he's saying he's not going to be testing positive after four weeks after 30 days he'll be playing, but if it takes 40 or the over 45 days you may have to scratch your head a little bit and wonder how much was he really doing. yeah so. Just have that framework, so you just said how am I going to trust him again. So you might say, well, I need a baseline I need to be able to see it, a clean drug screen looking forward to it, but just so you know son, though you go do it again it's going to push that 45 days forward. Forward forward, and it could take six months, so you better not be doing it because it's going to keep pushing that day that it's clear. further into the future, so he hopefully gets this see because he might if you still think will effort i've already got all my stuff gone i'm going to do it i'm gonna i'm gonna DAB right so."
215.0,Patient,yeah.
105.0,Provider,"The here but that's very different than you need to test clean, in order to end, you might set up a positive reinforcement. You know there's a carrot approach we all you offer something positive. Or you can return a privilege, but my point is, it can be a deterrent from continuing to use since i'm already caught I might as well, keep doing it, it addresses that one."
215.0,Patient,I see.
105.0,Provider,Something to keep in mind.
215.0,Patient,"yeah that's actually. It answered the that. took the head of my head like well, what are we going to do to get this point again yeah. cuz even like this, this weekend I think was no friends as well."
105.0,Provider,I know friends.
215.0,Patient,yeah.
105.0,Provider,"What about the point that you made with yourself, which was, I did it to. Do you remember that the pressure to have the same kind of fun same type of fun that your friends were having was critical was very important. yeah and. Your son's right on time with his own experience of that so that's pretty timely. yeah, what do you tell him to do when he's with all of his friends who are drinking and smoking, what can you do."
215.0,Patient,"See that's just like. I think my experiences were different, just because. In this case, like I don't have a whole lot of what advice to give them just because my experiences were so different from. Like. That he is now I was already pregnant with my son. So I had to grow up a little sooner, and I know I experimented with weed. But I never liked it, I never liked it enough to want to continue with it. to want to keep going with it, he seems to like it."
105.0,Provider,"But do you know why have you asked him what do you like about it. Yes, but what's the sensor."
215.0,Patient,So his thing is numbing.
105.0,Provider,numb num what's the numbing.
215.0,Patient,"So he's not being and then this is what I always asked him like he says i'm so stressed out why have you know how many you know you don't even understand how stressed out I am I see Okay, what are you stressed out about. He says just everything that's happened, and they always go into the House. it's always leading to the past what's happened in the past. And that's where I come in with you know because I know myself, and this is where I try to think you know as an adult it because it wasn't until I was an adult that I started to do that very same thing I started to know myself. was something very different. And I told me that in I don't really get into the whole like what I did with him, but just my experience, like, I was telling him, you know I wasn't able to. To take care of myself and heal myself. Until I was ready to let go my past and what I had been through. I had to finally come to terms with what I went through with everything. And that gave me my motivation to to finally get help for myself. and I have offered like if I told me know if you need to speak with somebody about it because I tried to get a little bit deeper with him as to what it is that he's holding on to so much and he'll briefly get into like you know his dad leaving him. And then the whole situation that happened, you know with his sister. But he doesn't want to go into details like I try to you know be like, if you need to talk to somebody you know I know we all went through it, so if you need to invent anything you need to say i'm here i'll listen, but he doesn't really. go that way with me. So I tell him if you'd like to speak with somebody about it other than me there's that option to he doesn't want them. But that's what it always goes back to."
105.0,Provider,So it's not worry about the future.
215.0,Patient,it's not what i'm sorry.
105.0,Provider,"worried about the future, it is not a preoccupation with the future. it's about the past."
215.0,Patient,Now past.
105.0,Provider,"I don't even know what you mean by let go of the past, I wrote it down, I wonder what it kid would do with that."
215.0,Patient,"Well, when I say let go of the past, I mean like I have. Like I live with it for a long time and. You know the yes, this happened to me and I don't want to think about it and I don't want to remember everything that happened so i'm just going to do this, try to make myself feel better. Well, I just felt like I did that for a long time and that's just my own situation and that's what I tell him it's my own situation i'm saying that's how you should feel or this is, you know what you're feeling, but then my situation that's just how I felt and. When I actually came to terms with everything. You know that happened and everything that I lost just got to the point where I just want everything back that's where I was able, and not so much let go, but just heal from it. Just try to heal from and move forward, instead of just being stuck in that fake like a blog that will let me go anywhere. i'm talking and having that there are be throughout the whole thing has also helped me and that's what I told him."
105.0,Provider,"You have done brace yourself, you ready to hold on to your desk. Of the clients and i've been here for with bright heart for like four and a half years or something you've been with me for some time. If I were to say. The therapeutic invent interventions that you've actually done with me. Very few. Very few when I compare like, if I were to say. You know i'll be seeing some clients, a little later, and we will be doing therapeutic techniques that deeply go into reprocessing early trauma. You and I don't do that. You have made changes in large part, on your own you have done it. Whatever reprocessing this term let go of past I don't know what that means came to terms don't know what that means, but you do. You know what that means that you know it very clearly what it means to have not come to terms with your past is I don't know what past we're talking about. You mentioned like one maybe one and a half times some early trauma but it's very. very lightly touched on, and then it's mostly about during your drug use, I don't think you are a huge fan of some behavior but mostly. I don't get to hear about what the substance is of the stuff that you're letting go of I don't know what it is, but you do you've done it if you could figure out what that mechanism of action is what the verb is, if you know in yourself how you did it you could teach it to your son. But knowing it in you how you did it. would be useful, because. Like go huh it happened, meaning let it go, you may forget that's what i'm doing that's what we does helps me forget like he's got his answer, what do you got it's better than we'd what's the thing you did. how'd you do it. yeah. yeah harder when we have to say, well, if I have to teach this thing that i'm doing. it's harder, we have to teach it to someone else."
215.0,Patient,Well yeah because it comes from inside of yourself.
105.0,Provider,yeah.
215.0,Patient,But do you do that. With others.
105.0,Provider,Do you know how you work.
215.0,Patient,"But it's hard to like. hard to say it like I don't know it's just something that I had to pull out of myself, because I hit. rock bottom. I think a lot of it too was. I see blame. But kinda. With my with my ex husband because that's where it started. use. Like out."
105.0,Provider,"It did not surprise you that your son will not know what you're talking about. notice how hard it is for you to label it even in you you've been hacking away at this for years, oh. yeah but to name it to describe what you do. When you have stress, which is a broad term like food is a broad term. And yeah, it is very broad sweeping in general. There can be some compassion there for your son that even you don't know how to describe how you take care of you on a daily basis, how do you do it, we can be humble there right because. How do you let go, how does he let go. and which parts let go maybe there are parts that he needs in order to develop and understand who he is right, this is complicated. huh."
215.0,Patient,yeah.
105.0,Provider,"come to terms, what are the terms can determine where are they. tricky."
215.0,Patient,"Well, for everybody it's different."
105.0,Provider,"It is a lot of times. But you have done, the majority of the work on your own you have found your way you don't have to have a therapist do it, you have barely used me with all of my clients. you're probably used me. The least I kid you not this many years working with someone and the least amount of like therapeutic interventions. You. work through things you may decide the loss aversion I will lose because you what you did have is I don't know exactly but you said you had a bottom. And he may have decided that the risk aversion the loss of health or your parents speaking to ever again I don't know what it was it started to tip the scale of wanting to numb. And so it shifted i'd rather face my stress feelings and get these things back trust car independence, I wanted these I want these things back, I want, I want to back and it and you did it. But you can't ask we can't use that same thing with a kid we can't say go ahead and. Get out of that house. Here here's rock bottom for you kicked out of the House. here's a here's a queen needle knock yourself out."
215.0,Patient,"rock bottom is totally different from you know where my son is right now, like I said mine didn't come until. A lot later."
105.0,Provider,"So his brain is not done, growing i'll be done, maybe I don't know whether he has a learning disability, but he'll be done growing with the prefrontal cortex maybe 2526 or 27 he's not done growing it's amazing what we call an adult and they're not really adults, yet."
215.0,Patient,we'll have to tell me that.
105.0,Provider,"I know I don't like I don't think they ever grow up. So my point is that we may. Wear that external executive functioning, for a long time. And so, drug screening and having the consequences there isn't something we have to be mad about we can just say that part of your brain you just won't think about the consequence you're going to think about short term relief. numbing or term relief you won't be thinking about long term consequences that you're inhibiting your ability to learn information because of the tapering experience that happens when you are ingesting the thc. you're not thinking about that you're thinking about the immediate benefits of relief from stress."
215.0,Patient,"Well, that I know like because I remember like I remember the way I felt. It was never long term thinking ever ever ever."
105.0,Provider,yeah.
215.0,Patient,It was always I need to feel better right now.
105.0,Provider,"i'm good, are you at going and doing things that bring a positive healthy. This is going to press on your goals now how good, are you at making sure that you are rewiring your brain and having a dope a mentorship experience that's based on some hobby or something fun right so you're modeling it."
215.0,Patient,"For your song and then that way time, let me just say this, I mean how much do you just said, but I have recently been tested. My wiring was recently with all the stuff that's going on with me. yeah whereas recently tested. Okay, because I got the doctor, do you want something for pain. No."
105.0,Provider,yeah.
215.0,Patient,"And even as we left he gave me three prescriptions. Hormone. iron. and medication for pain and he said, be careful with the pink mess, because those can become addicting. I did not get that one."
105.0,Provider,"i'm proud of you. isn't that yeah so I mean. This will be for the rest of your life, the same way, a food addict has to eat."
215.0,Patient,"And I realized that I was, I was taught, because you don't I, you know that wasn't even on my head that wasn't even in my brain, as I was there I was just suffering. bleeding out thinking i'm gonna bring him down. But once. That came out, I was like oh no."
105.0,Provider,"But just imagine. That you believed in me and really believe in the medicine of psychotherapy because, again, you you've got you've done tiny, tiny little things with me. you're moving it's bad connection tired there's been lots of challenges to are doing it many parts of it have been me too, but it's a particular type of medicine. What I offer, for example. and If you really believe it. Your confidence about being able to say to your son your self medicating fear. With thc if you're BSC man it's really about laughing your ass off. Okay that's something else, but if you're telling me that you're self medicating what's gets you the right medicine and a story. get the right medicine and if the right medicine is you spending time with you sitting with what are these things. Or, it is a professional. right we it's, this is the where the rubber hits the road it's like what do I really believe it."
215.0,Patient,yeah.
105.0,Provider,"he's saying, if we go with what he's saying I think about the past. If you're not the person to help him work, what would be let go or come to terms with his your phrasing. and getting the right medicine. Because he self medicating if this is just a kid experimenting okay that's pretty that's right that that's pretty above above. So one way, you can find out, you can find out how How often is he doing it can he claimed his system after 30 to 45 days, if he can you might have someone that. He can't and how will that feed your next step, my son couldn't do it, even with this consequence in in in front and I don't know what that might be i'm going to sell your playstation i'm normal it's going to be, but. It speaks to our ability to to do what you did when you were younger like i've had it I can't lose anything else, like you were done I don't know where that line your bottom. But we can generate ours by taking forever, which is a way, we can do that the kids like oh my gosh I can't go through this again this sucks i'm so lonely and bored out of my mind I can't do it i'd rather i'd rather have my stuff back. i'm not going to smoking anymore, but his what he's calling dressed out. I don't know how big, that is, I don't know if i'm i'm hearing about a boy that has self loathing I don't know if he has self esteem concerns I don't know I don't know how much it's impacting him. I would want to know. You know cuz in my philosophy we don't really want to take something away unless we're giving them something to replace it something healthier So what can you give him that can treat stress."
215.0,Patient,I don't know I would have took them about that.
105.0,Provider,yeah these are hard questions I don't i'm not.
215.0,Patient,"he's your heart. and saying, I have to sit down and have a heart to heart with him."
105.0,Provider,"Because it isn't and forgive me, but having respect for one's elders is an important socialization skill it's important. he's going to be around people that have power and authority and it'd be good for him. to know the difference between being able to be sarcastic with his peers and losing his job from a boss, because he was speaking the same way, to be good for him to know that and so he's learning it from from you to you and Robert is learning. But it's not."
215.0,Patient,"Exactly it's it's so funny, you said that because that's exactly what Robert told me he says, you know these are things that. We have to do for our kids because in the long run, you know what I mean like in the real world. And that's exactly what he said, a boss isn't going to take that a boss, is going to take. And they're going to find out the hard way okay you're going to get fired because you're replaceable."
105.0,Provider,"But. You know. there's more things to learn than just that, like if a kid has a smart mouth, it would fit that model right but it kid is saying i'm self medicating. abandoned abandonment concerns of my childhood. and fear you know he doesn't say anything about the future I haven't heard you say anything about future but. that's different. Right."
215.0,Patient,"He doesn't like because I asked him money it's never about the future, I mean he is you know talked about us richer and you know regular teenage things but it's it doesn't seem to be fear of future it's always about cost always."
105.0,Provider,What does he say.
215.0,Patient,Exactly what I told you it's always about his dad leaving.
105.0,Provider,"But he doesn't say yes, you say it's about my dad leaving or to see get into something."
215.0,Patient,without having to grow up without.
105.0,Provider,A doubt.
215.0,Patient,Without so it's not just the fact that he left it's. Every day after that that he's needed him.
105.0,Provider,Well marijuana is not going to solve that.
215.0,Patient,"No it's not. And then, of course, of that I guess what happened was la la just. It hit and Daniel like his said, you know you know I wish I wouldn't know because there's something I could I could have said something I didn't know and so he has this like guilt when it comes to that."
105.0,Provider,He needs to talk to somebody.
215.0,Patient,that's what I think.
105.0,Provider,"you're the mom. that's medicine, so, for example, you probably wouldn't go to Robert and say you decide whether he gets tylenol or not. You would give you would dispense it yourself but there's a very unique thing with this kind of medicine, remember, I was saying it's going to probably come down to how much you believe in it. yeah this particulars this stuff. has a special thing it isn't like tylenol it has prejudices and biases and tylenol is not a tylenol sometimes the medicine and you've met therapists they're not for everyone there's not a good fit it doesn't it doesn't always it's not cookie cutter. yeah so it takes more shopping."
215.0,Patient,Absolutely.
105.0,Provider,"But it could make the difference. In his brain development and his belief that he can meet. feelings of guilt shame insecurity abandonment that he can meet those. With his own skills with with just him and not have to medicate them it's a powerful statement, we can catch it early. Because what could happen is for the rest of his life, just like most people just give me a pill until I think about it, to make it going. We are in that culture and it takes a lot of fortitude to push back at it and say you were born with the ability to meet all of the adversity that comes your way. pain is going to happen, but the suffering that's where we can put our skills and we can get through this together and you're there for your son, you have a loving family. He just he's not alone, he has you."
215.0,Patient,Absolutely.
105.0,Provider,"Well i'm hoping, some of these things give you some idea out how to explore that but just know that they're probably going to raise vulnerabilities in you too. it's not it's not black and white right, I did the same thing you know, should I really do this, maybe I won't be as too hard and I did it to you know, he did his dad did leave him, you know I do feel bad you know we we start justifying certain behaviors because of our own stuff."
215.0,Patient,Not I know to.
105.0,Provider,Being a mom it's a hard job.
215.0,Patient,"Oh, my gosh it's. got. My lesson I tell the kids every day like going to work is easy."
105.0,Provider,"So just so you know and a lot of people forget so used to just meeting with me here, but under my name is the credential LM s T i'm a marriage and family therapist if you want to know how to sit. With Daniel and get him to talk. Just ask him we're going to have a family therapy session we might do a few throughout the coming months, this is the date, this is the time. that's it. yeah and he can share not share. We don't know what's going to happen until it happens you've met with me with your daughter. This one I would want you know sit at a table or couch and let's set it up, so that we can see both of you put some some preparation into it, but or even with Robert I i'm more than Mary as far as i'm concerned."
215.0,Patient,yeah that would actually. That would be great.
105.0,Provider,"Instead of that. And then is it in the coming weeks, really think about that. If you want. If you think that there's a dynamic happening between the three of you and. I might be able to help with that."
215.0,Patient,perfect. I would love to help.
105.0,Provider,So let's make an appointment sometime next year. that's fun I like saying that.
215.0,Patient,"I know right. Well, my calendar doesn't go to next year, so. Let me look. On my computer."
105.0,Provider,"yeah so i'm thinking, maybe January 3 unless you say you know what i'd rather do a family appointment with my son and I or with Robert you just let me know but otherwise we'll put in place 12 o'clock on January 3 it'll feel a lot like we did today."
215.0,Patient,January 3. Meeting. Is Monday. Okay. perfect. I will definitely. communicate what you have to offer and i'm sure i'm almost positive. That they would like to do that.
105.0,Provider,"Okay that's exciting. yeah something a little different. yeah and he'll get he'll be able to get an impression of someone from me, at least, hopefully, a positive one, that it's not going to be about shame and blame and having him feel stupid or bad or. You know I don't I don't tend to make people feel like that you've seen me I don't I didn't do it with your daughter."
215.0,Patient,"No, no."
105.0,Provider,"All right, enjoy your afternoon man, I hope you feel better soon oh."
215.0,Patient,me too. Just be way to.
105.0,Provider,You especially alright.
215.0,Patient,Thanks everyone.
