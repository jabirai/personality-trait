510.0,Provider,"I remember you shared that yeah yeah okay oh goodness, I really hope this works out but, obviously, if you have a dental emergency please go to urgent care, you know are really the er I don't think urgent care can even manage a dental emergency."
6685.0,Patient,"But, possibly, are you still on antibiotics. yeah and luckily I have some so i'm not totally sure."
510.0,Provider,"Okay okay. Good yeah all right, well, it sounds like you have a plan or I am wishing you the best and getting that resolved, it sounds like it is definitely continued to be a difficult situation, how are you doing around you're. I think you're on suboxone or a UN sub you text. I don't have your mental Okay, how is that going, how is your sobriety going."
6685.0,Patient,abroad is going good. I actually feel like i'm doing pretty good other than I need to i've been looking for some jobs so once I started working and I get this situation taken care of I think will be really good.
510.0,Provider,So it sounds like no relapses know urges i'm.
6685.0,Patient,"Wrong it urges sometimes you know. Situations but. OK i'll just work through it was so supportive group, you know and talk, talk, talk about people have a sponsor so I talked to him, like daily."
510.0,Provider,"I love that you have a sponsor I wish everybody had a sponsor with with their sobriety and their treatment goals so i'm so glad you're utilizing that support, along with group I do see that you've been attending your group. sounds like you're taking your meds. Are you having any cravings I know you said, maybe some urges that what about cravings as suboxone working as far as that."
6685.0,Patient,yeah I think working for today.
510.0,Provider,"Oh good good good good excellent, how is your mom doing. I know she is a big support you often talk to her as well, have you been in contact."
6685.0,Patient,"yeah she's doing pretty good she had a heart attack a long time ago, but so i'm always kind of worried about her because of that, you know. it's been a while now probably 10 years so she's doing good other than that so she. hasn't signatures or anything and she's still around you know she does with her mother so i'm sure that stresses are out of times but."
510.0,Provider,"Oh okay oh good I know you've identified her as a very good support they. sort of like a touch point right kind of remind you of kind of keeping you on track with your goals. Let me pull up, I want to let you know who your therapist your new ones, going to be I finally got that list so give me one SEC i'm going to pull that up now as a reminder your prescriber remains the same, which I believe is Julie kane, let me just. Yes, so your prescriber remains the same your group stays the same it's just your one to one me changes, so let me pull that up I can't remember everyone has been a lot of people are going to different folks I just want to make sure I say it properly let's see. course. So matt you're gonna be assigned after the end of this week, all my cases worth will be officially transferred I won't happen till probably Saturday October 2 because my last day is on the Friday. But you will be assigned to a therapist named Ellen I believe her last name is Clark Alan Clark, and, if I remember properly from. Another email I believe she is a primary substance abuse therapist so. i'm i'm a primary mental health i've dealt with substance abuse, I used to do assessments and ERS. But my practice and what i've done almost 20 years is primary mental health depression, anxiety trauma eating disorders. But um you're going to have primary substance abuse therapist so that might be a better fit I mean i've certainly enjoyed working with you, I know it's been a very short time. But um but that that certainly is right up her alley and, certainly, I know that was the main reason you've got connected to bret Hart was primary substance abuse so. Either way, I think you'll be in good hands for sure and. i'm just i'm really glad to hear that you've really sustain and continue to be very motivated. i'm i'm glad to hear about the job I know you're ready to to work again to now are you applying or you waiting to sort of deal with the dental issue. yeah yeah. yeah. It makes sense."
6685.0,Patient,"yeah I don't have too much for. yeah so I just need a little time, for they have to do surgery i'm assuming so check it a little time for that to usually work outside too, so I just feel like if I give it a little time to heal might be better for."
510.0,Provider,them and be prepared you won't be getting pain meds right so are you taking any over the counter stuff to help with.
6685.0,Patient,You know.
510.0,Provider,Are you.
6685.0,Patient,Okay well ibuprofen.
510.0,Provider,"yeah just the over the counter right right, and I know it probably dole's that a little bit, but. I tell you what. Dental nerve pain we talked about it it's it's no joke I. Know yeah."
6685.0,Patient,A reminder.
510.0,Provider,"yeah yeah you don't you certainly don't forget like oh yeah I gotta do this and that's the thing with tooth pain, sometimes it really just sort of spirals and there's just no. there's no other way, except to address it, which you're doing I. You don't have all the control about people who don't accept your insurance, which is. Tough you only found one. Well, we talked about. Have you talked directly, because your medicaid right. yeah yeah. is calling medicaid and going and. Going other and now or. That would be your other option if you haven't done that already."
6685.0,Patient,Is because they have the.
510.0,Provider,"Active providers that they're contracted with. And they could give you additional names, just in case I mean i'm. thankful you. were given the one name. But medicaid. Usually, they have more than one contracted provider. They have to, and if they can, if they can't give you that then usually they'll give exceptions, so you can see someone else who can see you so Either way, it might be. I know these are extra steps, but that's how you advocate to make sure that you. You know, try to stay, a network, but if they can't locate someone, then a lot of times insurance that will have to pay for someone who's out of the network if they can't."
6685.0,Patient,locate.
510.0,Provider,"Someone for you, does that make sense. yeah even for medicaid. Absolutely absolutely do you have that number. Is that on the back of your card like how to help find a provider okay good good."
6685.0,Patient,There should have an APP for that now.
510.0,Provider,there's an APP for everything. Our whole lives are going to be managed by an APP.
6685.0,Patient,Tom you remember a phone number.
510.0,Provider,"Well yeah. Now is digital like I had to memorize a phone number for the first time in a long time i'm like oh my gosh I need to just memorize this number. we're so used to kind of using our digital rolodex now. Yes, so that would be your your plan B if this other Doc says, well, I don't have an opening for four months, no way you can wait for a month, so, then I would be either going on the APP or calling medicaid try I need help finding a dentist who has an network, what are my options, you know. And, and they take it from there that's that's that process so don't don't feel like you just have to suffer."
6685.0,Patient,that's The last thing I want you to.
510.0,Provider,"To to do so i'm as far as working with a new therapist obviously you'll get on her calendar, but and she'll do a joining session, and you can start establishing those goals. But is there anything else you wanted to talk through today, it sounds like you're you're doing your best to stay on point. I really just want to reinforce that."
6685.0,Patient,yeah i'm doing pretty good.
510.0,Provider,Are you.
6685.0,Patient,"Considering, where I was not too long ago."
510.0,Provider,"yeah yeah the good part you can sort of look back that's a lot of times people feel like. I haven't made progress, but that's sort of if you think about it, you can look back and like no I I really have. And, and so that's a good thing. that's a really good thing there any other."
6685.0,Patient,"More good change. phone line, after your server can. I hear that, from a lot of people why, why do you think that is there's definitely a correlation I think when people are sober there tends to be more stability and good things happening."
510.0,Provider,"versus when i'm using tends to be chaos, why do you think that is what's your what's your take on that."
6685.0,Patient,"it's just all this human and connive and bad association and you know, with all that is gone and I don't know like maybe it's how it's just a whole industry is awful. I got I felt like. I had a lot of problems back when I was using drugs or when I was sober working I had built problems and stuff like that. And that would be stressful sometimes, but it seems like one hour with us, it would somehow be 10 times worse. All the action reaction from getting in trouble hurting people."
510.0,Provider,"yeah there's like. cascade right there's this cascade or domino effect if you'd like that metaphor better. that the primary focus and drive becomes the drug and people will literally do what they need to do to the addiction, and that means casualties right loss of. Relationships loss of jobs, you know breaking the law doing things that you probably not under the influence wouldn't be doing. But yeah the drive for the drug is so strong and for some it's it's just it's paramount right, I mean they're willing to hurt people steal from people. yeah yeah do you have a lot of guilt, when you look back on your history because matt you have a history. And that's Okay, but. A lot of times, I see that with substance abuse that they're trying. To look back on their history and and know that it's there it's a part of their their story, but it doesn't have to dictate their present day story right meaning you can't change the past but you certainly can learn from it. and make amends. Do you have a lot of guilt, do you look back and Are there things that and that might be something that you and Ellen talk about do you look back and do you have guilt or do you have a lot of rumination about things that you've done in the past."
6685.0,Patient,"yeah I do I think back and have a little bit, but I mean i've been trying to make some moments when I can you know, some of them I just can't because I can't be around as people with."
510.0,Provider,My right.
6685.0,Patient,"You know, but not a lot up in China, look forward, for the most part."
510.0,Provider,Okay.
6685.0,Patient,"Not to look back to lunch, you know. I feel like. move forward."
510.0,Provider,"Well, part of that process is. How you talk to yourself, you know with compassion and kindness right, just like you would to a friend in need are struggling you know talking to that person you talk to yourself that way too, because a lot of times we're our own worst critic. And we can really talk to ourselves pretty awfully and pretty harshly and viciously and that's not going to serve yeah that won't serve a purpose, you know. We all make mistakes, we all have things in our past that maybe we you know, want to change, but the reality is it's there but trying to really look at it. In the context of compassion and kindness and learn from it, which I think you're doing which it definitely sounds like you're doing and it sounds like you're working the steps because that's one of the steps is making amends when you're able to. yeah. For sure good yeah what step, are you on are you actively working the steps."
6685.0,Patient,For me. I had worked the steps before but i've been going through and trying to do some of them again. Oh good yeah.
510.0,Provider,"That one I think is hard yeah that. compassion for ourselves talk to ourselves, like we would. Have friended me it is it's easier said than done me included like i'm my own worst critic sometime like all right okay take a step back. And that it just takes that awareness and sometimes that's The first step is having that awareness move, but I talked to somebody a friend like that probably not nope. yeah yeah."
6685.0,Patient,Pre order muscle as well.
510.0,Provider,"yeah. Well, and I see it, well, I see it, a lot in my mental health clients, but definitely in the substance of these two of. You know, things that have happened in our past and we can't erase it if anything we can relate to it differently, and we can regulate our response to it. But I think the most powerful lesson I learned in my young 20s which seems like a lifetime ago. is learning that the past is not have to have the power over the present and and that's again easier said than done, we all. Knowing gets a free ride in this world as a human we all are going to experience suffering, we all have a history that we can learn from it and move forward you don't. I don't want you to feel like you have to beat yourself up and be played with guilt or riddled with you know. If I could just change the past you can't but you certainly can learn from it and and in this moment kind of move forward, which I think you really are, I think that's the feedback. That I certainly want to give to even in the short few times you've been able to work together, I think you're definitely working to. To do that, but it's a process right we know this is not any quick fix you have some time to to show some more consistency, which I think you're well on your way to doing. yeah. All right, was there anything else you wanted to talk through or any other stressors or things you want, I know i'm sensitive to your mouth, but i'm i'm so bad like I said, you took my last slot so i'm so glad we could reschedule."
6685.0,Patient,"yeah I want to talk to you for software get caught up something, it was my fault, I was late by the time I got it was way too late. yeah I got to talk to you too."
510.0,Provider,i'm really glad yeah i'm really glad to so I wish you the best matt I really do I think your resilience and your commitment to your sobriety is very evident so just take one day. One moment you've got this so. All right. Take care. you're very welcome I. session with matt campus over zoom room close.
