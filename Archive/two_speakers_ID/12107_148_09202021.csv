I don't know why i'm we have like 10 days left at our House to get out and we're not ready, and we are going to have a yard, sale and. And it's just it's all very overwhelming and i'm trying to cut back on rays and X, but i'm not being very successful with that because I still am taking it every day. And I have a dentist appointment at two."
148.0,Provider,Oh that's right.
12107.0,Patient,"Well, I just I feel really overwhelmed Ashley I just."
148.0,Provider,Okay.
12107.0,Patient,I feel like I need some kind of like release.
148.0,Provider,How do you usually find that when you're feeling stressed and overwhelmed.
12107.0,Patient,um probably by crying.
148.0,Provider,"yeah yeah that's a huge outlet actually and very, very healthy one very healthy um and can we just normalize this a little bit what you're going through it it's okay to feel overwhelmed right now it's okay to feel stress that moving is a very big thing right. it's a very big thing it's a lot of work to move there's a lot of moving pieces, so what you're feeling is is okay it's normal. it's just about taking care of yourself, through it, you know, and when you're feeling really overwhelmed okay i'm feeling overwhelmed what is the worst thing that could happen."
12107.0,Patient,that's a good question um I have a panic attack I guess.
148.0,Provider,"Okay, all right so that's scary What do you do when you have a panic attack."
12107.0,Patient,Take xanax.
148.0,Provider,"Right yeah take something that will. help you to get through that as prescribed always as prescribed. do some breathing just keep telling yourself that. You know. All you can do right now is take it one day at a time. you're not magically going to snap your fingers and trust me, I know I have wanted to do this before, especially during moves we just want to snap your fingers just be on the other side of it right beyond the other side of the stress, I know I know that feeling very well. But well we're human and it's not something we can just snap our fingers and it'd be over right, we have to walk through."
12107.0,Patient,"It yeah and i've lived in this House that we're living in right now for. Well 13 years almost so I I felt like. And the House that we're moving into was gifted to us by my mom's friend who passed away so it doesn't feel like our House it's very much her house, like her, furniture, is still in it. And so we're having to get rid of a lot of our furniture and I just kind of feel like weird about that too."
148.0,Provider,"Okay, so there's a lot coming up for you right now there's a lot of emotions coming up right now. yeah yeah um. How can we reframe this a little bit make it a you know. saying goodbye and change is always hard right, even when it's good change is hard. We as human beings, we want to be. comfortable and change is uncomfortable because it's something different, something we're not used to it something foreign fear the unknown is you know all of these things going through us. How can we reframe this into a positive. You know this has been my home it's time to say goodbye, but it could also be a really beautiful start to a new chapter in my life."
12107.0,Patient,"yeah like I have a lot of bad memories at this House too, because you know, I was in my addiction in this House and. have a lot of. You know, strange behavior and i'm. i'm kind of looking forward to like people, not knowing where I live, that I used to use with. yeah something they can't find me it feels safer. But I am going to like miss being in this location like we have a walking trail like right behind my house that that goes from our House to like. um. I don't know where where do you live."
148.0,Provider,"In northern California, in the Bay area."
12107.0,Patient,Oh i'm in modesto i'm in central California. it's just. A trail that like is very nice for walking in. And there's a park a couple blocks away and like we won't be by that anymore so.
148.0,Provider,"So it sounds like you're saying goodbye to some hard to staff right to a place that feels like home something that's comfortable. It also feels like you're saying goodbye to some things that it's time to let go of right, so you know, maybe some unwanted memories and feelings in this home, you know familiar people that are not good for you around this. home Those are all really healthy. Things, I think, to let go of now um so there's a balance here right balance it's not you know, maybe all good it's not all bad, but that's okay right it's even out it sounds like and. i'm like I said I just i'd like to see you go into this next because moving is you know kind of a next chapter starting next chapter building a new home. This is a time for you to build this home with your mom right make it yours, right now, it doesn't feel like yours, of course, because you're not you haven't been living there right, it has been somebody else's. um and again that's Okay, but you will, over time, you can build this you know and make it a home. For you and your mom gonna just you and your mom going to be living there right."
12107.0,Patient,yeah and it's really small so i'm. Getting a phone call. and it's really small so we're having to like really downsize a lot of our stuff in.
148.0,Provider,mentioned that.
12107.0,Patient,"The is going through like boxes of. Our childhood art projects that from elementary school, you know and like I said I didn't throw it away because I know my mom wants to keep it, but then I just throw it all away um so that felt, really, really good but."
148.0,Provider,"yeah I think what's worth holding on. To it's really sentimental things you know the things that you cannot see yourself living without the things that mean something to you. That you don't want to part with and that's Okay, but you know purging also feels really good getting rid of staff that you know you have room for. Or you know you've had room for this whole time right up to this point we're just like when I could get rid of that probably wouldn't notice different, but why would I you know fits perfectly right there purging feels really good."
12107.0,Patient,"I have this. You know, like the posters are. The big wall things that you have face cutouts and you put your face there, and you take a picture. yeah I made one. With the mermaid and octopus and it's really cool and it's made out of cardboard and it's it's been in the garage for like 10 years I made it for my ex boyfriends daughter's birthday. And it's just like a really cool big piece of art, but it's all covered in cobwebs now and and it's just like. I don't know what to do with that, like i'm thinking my mom thinks that she's gonna bring it to the new House but I don't want to and."
148.0,Provider,"yeah yeah and again like you really have to tune into your yourself, and you know ask yourself How important is it for you, is it healthy to hold on to for me. yeah it healthy. Oh yeah to let go of that let go of the past sometimes it's just what we need to do right let go the past there's nothing there that we can change let go of the future right now too right there's nothing there, we can change."
12107.0,Patient,yeah i'm constantly thinking about the past and the future. yeah which Depression and anxiety.
148.0,Provider,"Right, I was just gonna say like you know I think a lot of people say this at this point, but I. Remember reading it for the first time, and one of Don Miguel Ruiz his books, I think it was the four agreements, he wrote this in, but if you're living in the past you're living in depression again because there's nothing there that you can change right."
12107.0,Patient,Right.
148.0,Provider,"keep going back there you're going to feel depressed you're going to feel upset if you keep living in the future, you feel anxious right again nothing there that we can we can do, or change what you have control over right now, today in this moment what choices, you make today. yeah which yeah you can take what you've learned from your past put it towards those choices today right which could impact your future but again we're not really thinking of either of those because we. don't have control over them."
12107.0,Patient,yeah.
148.0,Provider,"And sometimes he's getting so. I don't know what word to use not obsess just getting so into things that we can't control really they make us crazy because there's nothing we can do about it right. Totally so yeah practicing mindfulness doing some mindfulness meditation right now, as you go through these next 10 days, especially just keep bringing yourself back to the present moment mindfulness actually means paying attention in the present moment. What am I thinking how am I feeling right what is myself talk like is it all negative. yeah that plays a big big big role on how you're feeling what you're constantly feeding yourself and telling yourself those thoughts. yeah that affects how you're feeling."
12107.0,Patient,"yeah. I just feel like out of control, or you know."
148.0,Provider,"mm hmm, and that means that you're not in the present moment. Right, because if you're in the present moment you have control right, you have control over right now you're here you're talking through these things. You know you're letting it out of you, which is a huge outlet, it may not feel like it right now, but what you're doing is very, very healthy right now for yourself."
12107.0,Patient,Okay well that's good to hear I guess.
148.0,Provider,"yeah yeah. I know it's a lot and, but you can walk through this and you will get through this and you will come out the other side."
12107.0,Patient,Ah.
148.0,Provider,"It will be okay, and this too shall pass, we just need to keep you at one day at a time. In your moment in the present moment keep doing your breathing keep what are my thoughts. What am I telling myself. Because if i'm feeling overwhelmed most likely i'm having some really, really stressful anxiety provoking. thoughts and are they all rational, who knows who knows a lot of our thoughts are worrying about things that haven't happened yet won't happen."
12107.0,Patient,"yeah. And yeah and just the whole just the change is really. what's like the most upsetting to me. there's. Have the crazy cat that destroys everything, and I feel like she's gonna like really mess up the new house and the new House still has furniture in it that, like we need to get rid of, and I don't know how we're going to do that. And the backyard is very. meticulously landscaped and I know who's going to take care of that. And there's this. there's a hot tub that we don't know how to care for as far as like putting the chlorine and it doesn't even turn on right now so there's that."
148.0,Provider,"i'm a again a lot i'm hearing a lot of things that you don't have control over i'm just looking up a quote as you're talking that's coming up for me that I want to share with you. That is not the right one thought I had it. Sorry. Sorry, I thought I hear. About worrying here we go. Constantly worrying, and you know these are all, I would say valid worries but it's like how much can we do with it that's what I keep going back to how come how much can we really do with these worries. So I want to share this with you constantly worrying about high hypothetical terrible situations will not make you more prepared. Constantly worrying about hypothetical terrible situations will not make it hurt less if it happens worrying and preparing are not the same thing when you worry about something that may not even happen you're just forcing yourself to go through that stress, as if it was happening. Over and over. anxiety will have you convinced that you're worrying is productive, but how much time and energy have you spent worrying about things that never happened. it's a big question how much time and energy have you spent worrying about things that never happened. You can use your anxiety productively it's important to identify if you can even prepare for this and what needs to be done worry will often have you focusing on the things that cannot be fixed or changed. What do you think about that."
12107.0,Patient,"I mean that sounds right on the. way. That. That completely sounds true, but I feel like I worry about things that do happen. i'm. Like well Greg all the things that I just. listed to you or things that are that are going to happen that I need I need to take care of."
148.0,Provider,"Okay, but you have to consider. You have to consider how much you can prepare you know, for what what you think you know how can you prepare for this, how can you. Set up the cat somewhere that feels like a safe space where it can't get into too much right those kind of things versus. Oh, this is going to happen, and this is going to happen and then all these negative things, building on top of you, I mean that's gonna yeah that's gonna weigh you down, naturally, that will weigh you down right. Does that make sense. Do you hear you hear what i'm saying. Yes, okay. yeah just keep breathing just breathe. Because you know. Even with all these things piling up that you know, maybe could happen right. Realistically, will they all happen in the same day."
12107.0,Patient,No.
148.0,Provider,"No, but like that, like I just read to you you're putting yourself through the stress, as if it is happening already. And that's the stress that's not healthy for us."
12107.0,Patient,yeah.
148.0,Provider,"And I know you're probably looking at me like yeah it's a lot easier said than I know it's a lot easier said than done, but it's it's really you know pulling ourselves back and just. Okay, in this moment not i'm not dealing with any of those things right now right. In this moment what you're dealing with is. getting through this session with me, you know, hopefully feeling better. And then. going to your dentist's appointment right getting that done. yeah one thing at a time things you know as they come."
12107.0,Patient,yeah.
148.0,Provider,let's deal with things as they come.
12107.0,Patient,I feel kind of guilty going to the dentist appointment to right in the middle of the day when i'm supposed to be like helping packing and everything and. Last time I was there for over two hours. So i'm worried about that.
148.0,Provider,"yeah lots of worry lots of stress, I hear it, I can feel it in your energy today. yeah, but I think these are the most important times to just take a step back and do something for yourself right your oral health is very, very important, I think it's okay to take you know 30 minutes or an hour out today to get that taken care of. yeah yeah you are important. Your health your well being mentally physically all of it, so if you have to you know take an hour here they're out of the day. yeah that is more than okay."
12107.0,Patient,just wanted to be over.
148.0,Provider,"I know you do I know you do, and it will be you'll get there. and You didn't kind of put this in your head the next time you talk to me know darn it. cuz we're going to be meeting we're meeting weekly now. For the next time we talk to me will be very, very close to the 30th right. yeah so we can kind of. Re evaluate where you are then how you're feeling then i'm preparing up so we'll probably meet next Monday, so then you'll have a couple more days before the 30th that Thursday and then. really just walk you through those next few days right really just take it back take it back and just how am I going to get through today. How am I going to get through. tomorrow. Do you think that'll be helpful for you. yeah okay."
12107.0,Patient,I do know.
148.0,Provider,And just allow yourself to be human in this right allow yourself to to know that you as one person are only capable of doing so much in one day right. yeah yeah.
12107.0,Patient,"and on top of this, like i'm trying to get. You know, mental health care and psychiatric care. and trying to get in with my county programs."
148.0,Provider,yeah.
12107.0,Patient,"Having shauntel contact them and tell them I need a higher level of care or and I just keep having to make all these phone calls and I really, really hate doing that."
148.0,Provider,yeah.
12107.0,Patient,I hate I hate having to do like. menial. tasks and.
148.0,Provider,"I get it so for now because because we're in a very stressful period of time these next 10 days. Can you mark off like an hour two hours each day, just to do little things for yourself like maybe making a couple calls. Maybe doing a meditation maybe doing some journaling maybe just going for a walk and getting out of your head Listening to some music I don't know how does that sound."
12107.0,Patient,yeah that sounds good.
148.0,Provider,"Maybe it's you know, maybe you split it up, you know 30 minutes in the morning 30 minutes in the afternoon right or maybe it's just one hour you put aside just for yourself, so that you're still taking care of the things that you need to take care of. Because what happens is we think about everything we have to do all at once all at once all wants to it's like screw that this is too much i'm not doing any of it right. And that. Just comes back all at once. Right is that kind of what you're feeling right now."
12107.0,Patient,yeah I always future trip and.
148.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
12107.0,Patient,"Get overwhelmed like always I always like have all these ideas for fun things to do, like projects and like oh on Christmas. Day, we can do this and make gingerbread houses with the family and all by all the supplies and all and it sounds like such a good idea, and then like and the last minute i'll be so overwhelmed by all of it that i'll just like drop the ball completely and. Last."
148.0,Provider,"But that that's that makes sense right when we think of everything at once. Right like I look back. I don't know if this is a good example, but. back when I was in school right I would look at everything I had to do for all four or five of my classes all at once, where I would just be like. No, thank you right and just walk away from it all because it's too overwhelming to look at everything at once right we do the same thing in recovery, you know people, especially in early recovery I can't imagine. You know, being sober for the rest of my life that is way too overwhelming usually that's a big reason why people go back out and use again. Which is again why we say, one day, at a time one, at a time one breath, at a time."
12107.0,Patient,one.
148.0,Provider,"Because that's it's you know what you're describing is very I mean I hate the word normal, but it is you know. Common where. You are not alone in that yeah absolutely you're not alone in it. I know it doesn't make it any easier to make those feelings go away around that but. yeah just take some. Some conscious reprogramming okay i'm feeling overwhelmed because i'm looking at everything all at once, right everything I need to naturally i'm going to feel overwhelmed. What if I just look at the first thing right, the first thing on my list here and I do that Okay, I can do that right one thing at a time. yeah even if you need to just write it out, even if you need to write it on out on separate pages and just look at that one page that one day."
12107.0,Patient,yeah that's what my mom is always telling me to do just one thing at a time.
148.0,Provider,"and You know, again change is not easy and and when it comes to these things it's not easy, because i'm so used to my routine, this is what i'm used to doing so, this is what I naturally go back to. Look at everything at once, I get overwhelmed I think of everything I have to do it's not fun right, I have to make that conscious effort to Okay, I know i'm. thinking and behaving in old ways i'm going to try this i'm going to try something that's different. It may feel uncomfortable because it's different right i'm not really sure yet if it's going to be something that works for me, but that's all about exploring and discovering what does work for you. put it to the test."
12107.0,Patient,yeah.
148.0,Provider,"You know, maybe, that means getting a planner and. Writing some priorities or two dues, you know throughout the week. Or maybe it's just getting a journal and journaling what you want to do today, I don't know what it looks like exactly for you again, it has to work for you doesn't matter what works for me doesn't matter if it works for your neighbor right, it has to work for you."
12107.0,Patient,Right.
148.0,Provider,So it's 130 I do want to be mindful that you have a dentist appointment in 30 minutes.
12107.0,Patient,So I should probably get going.
148.0,Provider,let's schedule your session for next week.
12107.0,Patient,I think I have an appointment with you on 920.
148.0,Provider,"Oh perfect. You do okay so i'll see you next Tuesday at noon that makes it easy um before you go, I know you were really stressed coming in today how are you feeling now."
12107.0,Patient,"and telling a little bit better. Okay, good good."
148.0,Provider,"yeah, of course, keep breathing. breathing and really keep up some positive self talk right now. Okay okay take care i'll see you next week."
12107.0,Patient,Okay bye.
