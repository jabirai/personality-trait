14123.0,Patient,hi Valerie.
705.0,Provider,How are you.
14123.0,Patient,i'm all. i'm all i'm all right.
705.0,Provider,Okay well i'm glad you joined me and do you prefer to be called Linda or ellie.
14123.0,Patient,"You can call me. l. that's fine. yeah. Okay, Linda or. l so yeah."
705.0,Provider,"Okay, I was just going to wasn't wasn't sure. And i'll see did I spell it right El le. yeah okay. Perfect well i'm Valerie and so i'm part of the brave heart health team i'm glad you're here this morning and what we're gonna do today is an assessment, have you ever had sometimes they might call it a bio psychosocial assessment."
14123.0,Patient,"No, no, I know I haven't I i've had assessments before and i've had therapist before. But I I don't i'm not familiar, I guess, with this specific one or."
705.0,Provider,"Okay well it's today it's different than a counseling session like a counseling session usually would talk about me probably know from therapy. Is you talk about coping skills would explore it a little bit more today it's more of them answering questions answering questions where we can get to know you a little bit more and gathering history. Such as childhood currently like where do you live, and things like that reasons why you joined Brian heartfelt I know what happens with this is this. Information we take to know you know okay here's where your strengths are and we want to build on that and then also like places that we see maybe can have some improvement or you want to change, we can also take a look at that."
14123.0,Patient,"I see yeah and then I guess I also had some questions about exam just not very familiar with this whole like right her health service. yeah I the whole thing's been a little bit like confusing for me to navigate. But yeah i'm happy to I guess. Like it i'm answer, like the you know the questions and then. Maybe ask I don't know if you're like my assigned therapist or it, this is like an intake session or what what the whole processes is just feels a little bit I know it's being recorded and everything and i'm just feeling a little bit like confused about the whole like I guess process."
705.0,Provider,"shirt no and you're you're not alone, I know, when you first start is just like wow you know you have the intake process, and then you come usually to me or another. clinician and you go over the assessment and then with it they'll be you know, usually the virtual clinic reaches out the setup your first individual session. What I can do to l is check to see if you are assigned to me, and if so, then we can go ahead and schedule that appointment if that's okay with you."
14123.0,Patient,Oh yeah I I yeah I just yeah I was told this is like my initial therapy appointment and now i'm understanding that it's an intake session and that's and that's fine it's just i'm just trying to wrap my head around like the whole. Sure thing.
705.0,Provider,"Absolutely absolutely and I encourage asked questions anything that you do not understand, please do ask. i'm looking up to right now, I see that i'm the assigned clinician and so you and I can set up your initial individual session, if you like, we can do that even right now, before we even get going, if that's okay with you."
14123.0,Patient,"Oh yeah that yeah yeah. it's it's a little bit like I guess because i'm used to like looking for a therapist and then like having a consultation and seeing if it's a match first you know and then like hearing the background of the therapist and then. Like you know what I mean like I know that that's like the standard process so right now I feel just a little bit overwhelmed with like. Getting my personal information and history and background before even like knowing like much about bright health as an organization and then like. Getting assigned a therapist without knowing the background of a therapist or having connected, so I guess i'm i'm glad that, like there's this session to. connect with you, especially because I, you know if if you're my assigned therapist but I guess it's just a little bit backwards from like the standard way. This and. And it's not the psychiatrists that i'm seeing that's dispensing like my medication it's a nurse and so. All of this is kind of giving me little like uncomfortable like warning warning flags that I just wanted to kind of put at ease through like you know some some like conversation and questions like."
705.0,Provider,"Oh, all of what you're asking oh I I you know again ask away i'm very transparent i'll share with you i'm a licensed advanced alcohol and drug counselor. What I do is when i'm assigned to the different groups that I work with the prescriber is that I work on coping skills, so I work with the. different groups that have anxiety I work with different groups with borderline personalities I work with different groups with bipolar and things like that that we go over different phases. In the event that a patient is needing a licensed therapist, then that is something and I can even do that today to put in that, if you like, to work with a licensed therapist. Then we can make that referral, especially to if it's something for trauma and I again l advocate for what you need if if there's trauma we have someone that works in a specialty with em er they do have, do you know about that technique."
14123.0,Patient,No i'm more familiar and i've been recommended cognitive behavioral therapy like.
705.0,Provider,Right right and.
14123.0,Patient,"And what i'm suffering, I think, is a lot of. Like I know those things that get all it very interrelated, but like what I have is a lot of childhood trauma and abuse and ptsd from that. And you know that leads to like self medication or coping or things like that, but I think yeah, I guess, I thank you for even clarifying because um you know the the the system seems like yeah, it is a little bit murky so I really glad that you clarified that. you're an alcohol and drug. Like addiction or abuse specialist right."
705.0,Provider,"Right so i'm a licensed advanced alcohol and drug counselor so i've been doing this, since about 2003 and so i'll just give you a quick because again i'm glad you're asking the question so since 2003. I became a drug and alcohol counselor I also teach drug and alcohol counseling to students so i'm also a professor at one of our la sites, I also have worked for the military, specifically in the ptsd. D Groups, and so what we did there it's a lot of like cognitive processing groups so it's a little bit to friend. My background i've worked with like the groups that I shared with you. and other types of groups to. If, though, you know you're you're sharing that you have trauma what they usually I know, especially for if you're wanting that the technique worth the emt are. is usually having someone that comes into bright heart health they work with you know go into groups work with this signed. clinician and then see if you're ready to go into that technique if you're feeling like right now you want to start with a licensed therapist and you work on some of you know. Coping skills and then start the journey with more addressing that trauma to. Then, that could be where you work with a therapist you go through that and then, if you're wanting to do the other technique that then they could even transfer you to we have someone that's really great at that it's I movement desensitization attacks it teaches you. Different techniques to lower the intensity of the trauma so it's not like it disappears, but it does lower the intensity."
14123.0,Patient,"and I. Okay, I guess that sounds like a specific like technique to like I exercise to lower intensity of trauma I I, for some reason, thought it was like a I guess a whole range of well, I know I know it's like a whole range of things between like talk therapy and like you know different like. cognitive behavioral therapy and a bunch of things. Right and I. and I let's see in terms of coping and like self medicating I have been like drinking like i'm not an I would I guess i'm not a well i've been drinking a lot like. You know, every day to kind of try to like stave off the depression and the anxiety that I have um do you mind holding on a second i'm going to ask my my friend, something is that okay. Okay, thanks."
705.0,Provider,"Oh, I can't hear you I think you're muted sign."
14123.0,Patient,Oh yeah yeah. yeah sorry no worries um. Thank you so much i'm just i'm if you don't mind just giving me another minute I really appreciate it.
705.0,Provider,is absolutely.
14123.0,Patient,"I would tell her. I count. Is Valerie so thank you so much for. your patience yeah I guess i'm. uh. yeah sorry it's all it's This is like, I guess, a little bit overwhelming, for me, because. It. was yesterday I was talking to like the nurse that I had been assigned medication and i've you know, been told before like. From my you know from friends who are psychiatry is like you and otherwise like that you should really be assigned to psychiatrists to attend to your medicine management and cycle. You know what I mean vers versus the nurses and that's something that also kind of set up a flag off in my head and then I was told that today would be like some kind of therapy session and. And so, and then I also like the their suggestion day like I think you know we have to kind of specific groups addiction groups or. Mental health groups and he was saying, like, I think that you'd be a better fit for. The mental health group but, but then you know it seems like I was just assigned to the addiction group for alcohol and drug use and so all of it has been really kind of overwhelming to like to take in and so yeah I don't know."
705.0,Provider,"Right oh I I understand and I sense that you're not comfortable and I can see that you're not feeling like Okay, you know you still have some questions and. For me, your comfort level is paramount that's buying it my important is I want you to be able to feel comfortable. you're not the first person that when when I share i'm a licensed event alcohol and drug counselor that you're not in the addiction group, because I also do the mental health groups, and so this was a you know, and I can see like how you're sharing. That you want more of a psychiatrist to look at your management, and so what I would do l is. Do you know, would it be better to ask you know is is you know if you're asking about a psychiatry is that is that something, you know that. That they can do in anything else that you're thinking you would need on that would make you feel more comfortable."
14123.0,Patient,"yeah I like does it I do feel like yeah I guess I. I. I don't know if it's because there's like a lot of influx of patients, right now, like I I guess I i'm really bad at expressing how I feel i'm."
705.0,Provider,doing fine i'm getting ready.
14123.0,Patient,"yeah go through um. yeah or um. I guess I do feel kind of like toss like i'm being tossed around and it's kind of like a mill of just people like being like kind of pushed through and i'm not quite sure like what the process is to be like begin with and so that's kind of. it's kind of it's kind of stressful but also a little discouraging. And I guess I just don't know like is it like this, like right her health, like how, how come like you know they have nurses assigned to do medicine management and not psychiatry so is that something that that you know, like and why that reason could be."
705.0,Provider,"Sure, first of all I want to just share with you is I hope this does not discourage you, no matter what, if you if you stay with bright heart health or you go somewhere else, I want you to get the help that you need and you deserve okay. So i'm glad you're asking the questions from my understanding, and you would get. A little bit clearer with talking to the intake department is I do know I work with two prescribers that also they have an md that they work under. And so they're nurse practitioners I don't i'm sorry I don't have like if that's the way for all groups, because I do the two groups, if that makes sense. So what I would like to do l is be able to share with the intake take department to set up a meeting where I can ask them to like you're saying. If there would be a psychologist psychiatrist that you would be under if that's, something that would be possible, and then also what I can do is. Have the assigned therapist be one that is ready to address the trauma not not the eye movement desensitization but the the trauma to start there."
14123.0,Patient,"yeah I guess I don't i'm. Like I don't. I don't like I want to, I guess, I don't want to offend the nurse that i've been assigned, and I, and I don't want to. yeah I guess historically I just don't want to like want to cause any trouble i'm."
705.0,Provider,Not at all.
14123.0,Patient,I just don't know like is it even like a common thing for like bright heart health to like have psychiatrists or is it like a common thing to have nurses and like why like costs. And like why that oh yeah um. yeah if you just kind of know the answer to that.
705.0,Provider,"or nothing so l you know you're you're not by asking questions, I would encourage you to ask questions and to advocate for yourself that's no no offense. To you were saying like if you asked the nurse practitioner, if you can have a psychiatrist and things like that that's not offensive at all, because this is your care and your comfort level. And so what i'm going to do, because I don't know exactly the question that you're asking like I know we have different medical providers on board there's a big mix of them my role is limited, but I want to find. your specific questions you have answers to them, where you feel more comfortable and that's understandable. If I was new and I was joining a group, you know I would ask questions, too, and want to make sure that I feel like it's a good fit."
14123.0,Patient,"Three not yeah well. yeah Thank you, I really appreciate the. The understanding there um. yeah I don't know like if yeah, I guess, I have a really yeah. hard time yeah being vulnerable or asking or you know. i'm. Just advocating for myself really I guess."
705.0,Provider,"you've done a really good job, today I get I get it you've done a really good job of advocating for yourself and being assertive."
14123.0,Patient,"Thank you um and I guess like I guess my question would be like. Like I guess for therapy appointments with with you. What is that, like entail like what is this like. I don't even know where the right route to take, obviously, you know I don't know if it would be addressing like i'm talking about like you know, having self medicated without the hall or not or talking through a therapist or not I like. i'm sorry, can you hold on one more second i'm. Sure yeah Thank you I."
705.0,Provider,know your final.
14123.0,Patient,"And thank you for being so nice. Absolutely, you know for this whole thing I am. yeah. I think you like. I know I need a lot of help, and I know I need a lot of like care right now I know i'm in a really not great place with Depression and anxiety and I know it's from my trauma ptsd like. And I know that i've been medicating like self medicating with that but, like those are the things that I do know, and I also know that I don't necessarily like yeah it's like. startling a couple things just to you know, have every single thing be recorded words like i've had therapy appointments before with you know my. therapist and they weren't recorded and then all of a sudden, like I just kind of feel tossed around, and so I guess the whole thing is a little bit overwhelming and i'm i'm with my friend right now and and he's actually. Like can just sat and to join in on this call with me and so he wanted to kind of introduce themselves but that's okay I don't know why. Right why. I wanted to give her own space and i'm. i've been hosting my friend else you know cuz she's you know, been dealing with what society and. She doesn't really have close family support, which is, of course, really, really tough and i've been trying to help her navigate through things so I know. I help other friends in the past that, though with different situations and family members and that's why I was like hey would you like me to be nearby you know, like and i'm happy to assist or it will do articulator. Right, basically, I think what I don't i'm not sure how the added I mean I how bright health works or how she got to be in touch with them. The sensation that i'm getting from from seeing the process it just feels like an online rehab Center because i've helped friend, it sounds like that type of dynamic. right that there's like as if you weren't going to a clinic and you want two different appointments and each one is very compartment. compartmentalized and you know, like each one has a very specific set of things that are not perhaps that was, I think what else feels like they're not necessarily cater to her persona to her, you know. that's why I think the questions because you know, usually, when you go to a therapist is like okay we're gonna have a conversation and and it's a little more. Organic kind of kind of happening in a in a rehab cleaning kind of situation is more like you're taking around to place to place and you don't have many options right it's more like so. And I think that that you know. yeah l is mostly dealing with anxiety and post trauma kind of things that have a right, I rose, you know, like like depression like deep yeah action. And the trauma stemming from like my past and yeah I guess I guess it'd be nice to know, I wonder if the if the clinic is the right, even the right approach for for l what's the I mean How do people get to this clinic usually what's the."
705.0,Provider,"First of all, i'm glad that you heard there to support I think that's."
14123.0,Patient,"All right, I didn't lie. secretive or anything like that I just want I was, I was just want you know went to make sure that you know you always you know."
705.0,Provider,right but i'm so glad that ld that and i'm sorry What was your name again.
14123.0,Patient,My name is now well.
705.0,Provider,"Now well i'm glad that you're there and i'm glad that you're supported and to me again. l E advocating for what you what you need and so asking questions and all of it. Is is great and Noel to our program is is different i've worked for other programs too so each program has a little bit of difference, and so, sometimes, especially if l if you're looking for something that's a little bit more like we do a lot of groups with the individuals. Have are you thinking l to like I know, sometimes it's even a decision of if you feel like. Wanting to start first with a therapist in person and then move to the virtual because i've had that happen to before where i've met with a person and they said, maybe i'll start with in person and then go to virtual so I mean, these are different options."
14123.0,Patient,"yeah my question is, I guess, my mind, is just being matched with somebody that I know like has, I guess, and like you know when you go to psychology today or or. or psychologist calm and then there's different specializations like child trauma or sexual abuse or you know, like major depression or like anxiety like like women's health, like, I guess, I am just a very This is just like a very different approach to. Finding a therapist and and getting assigned one so. For me, I. yeah I don't know if, like. It yeah I don't know how how you landed with the splitting of as if you know, right now, this is a resource that you know where I was like okay let's. You already have you know you're already made a little bit of a way into this rain session so let's see what we know what good can do to you. know not. On but the whole process seems that is causing a little more. excited and you know, then there and then you know yeah. I wonder, so I wonder if it's the right type of yeah I don't know what if this groups are for specific type of situations or if you know."
705.0,Provider,"Right I would you know explore, to make sure, because, like you're talking about l that you want a special specialty someone that what i'm hearing someone that specializes in childhood trauma and someone that's able to guide you through that. And so I hear you and you know just like where you're talking about Noel is that. The different types of groups in Is this the best fit the only way that you're going to know that is to explore and ask the questions like you're asking, I think that that's great and L I know you said that you know earlier, you seem to doubt yourself. From what i'm hearing today you're on the right track, you know what you need and so being able to advocate for that and just say I need a special because. that's what i'm hearing."
14123.0,Patient,"Like when you just like you just mentioned, you have like you know experience with like working in the military."
705.0,Provider,With me.
14123.0,Patient,"Yesterday, and then like alcohol and drug abuse like I don't know if me having like. been drinking. To like stave off the anxiety and depression. Is. in that category of patients that you have history with and what like would be the kind of. Like what would your kind of sessions be like because you know for this program here that i've been assigned, scientific and assigned to you right."
705.0,Provider,"For right now and what I do is after the assessment is, then, especially if someone saying that they have trauma and they want someone that specializes in trauma than I have I reach out to my Supervisor to share. license you know therapist who do we have someone that I could then make the assigned therapist and then that way l you're working with the licensed therapist that addresses the trauma. If you feel like then like, especially with the licensed therapist most everyone at bright heart health to has the capacity to also help you with the substance abuse as a coping you know you've been using it as a coping mechanism and to be able to help you with that too."
14123.0,Patient,"yeah but I mean the thing is that her as soon as she doesn't feel. An institutional anxiety or depression won't go to to drink is like yeah I, yes, I feel like attacking the alcohol as a thing it's like the after the fact, you know. Because I mean I have, I have friends who have dealt with alcohol, and I mean i've i've taken in France to rehab I mean we have hasn't centers you know, bringing my friends and sitting there with. And usually what i've learned from diets that is really an it's really an impossibility of not being able to detach from from the substance but it's usually separated from the other preconditions of you know feeling depressed or anxious or and it's. As soon as l doesn't feel like this pressure. She doesn't have a nurse to drink like it at all it's it's not that's why i'm not so of course I go horse no good yeah in any situation like when you are, you know when you when you take it, because you. Know for regression away or whatever right on our you know but it's not the craving of alcohol itself or the substance itself that she's dealing with to and it's a very different approach when you go. You know substance abuse centers are are are coded to to work in a specific way that has to do with not being able to go i'm not in control, like, I know that kind of thing we, I mean I know drunk. But it is really about support and being able to feel comfortable and and and having a network of support for hair I think at this is from like the clothes, you know i've been here, maybe for like 12 days now that she's been with me and you know number for a long time and. I think that if we could find you know. The desk yeah that shouldn't be the approach the default approach to you know I you know to be as an alcohol patient situation because that's kind of undermining do other things are really I think the cost of stress and anxiety for her."
705.0,Provider,"Right and there are some some programs to that deal mainly with childhood trauma and their trauma groups. You know, we have various groups and some of them are more mixed you might have someone that maybe is struggling and it's more with substance use disorder and then you have someone that's maybe more anxiety use disorder. You know what what I can do to is so I can reach out to our intake department and just let them know the questions you have really good questions and then also to if this isn't a good fit is for the intake. providers to see who because we have a network of people and to see who we could refer to that may be a better fit."
14123.0,Patient,"Do you think you have local people that's not online, perhaps."
705.0,Provider,That would be what what I can ask the intake to specifically look at a referral that's in person.
14123.0,Patient,"That, I think that'd be that'd be a wonderful thing, because something that personal company and personal supporting a very humane and face to face away I think it's something that that they can go a long way."
705.0,Provider,"Right and i've had where then people will first you know others have gone in, and they have the in person. And you work through that and then come back, as this is seeing you know, sometimes as more as sometimes people are like aftercare. it's like Okay, now that I have in person, now I want to do virtual just to maintain, like all those skills that you've learned and things like that does, that is, that okay."
14123.0,Patient,"yeah yeah yeah i'll let you yeah no I mean I like and and now like, I guess, my fear is like that. Valerie like you're like you're very nice person, you know, and now I my fear is. Maybe the person I get won't be as Nice or you know what I mean or you know won't be compassionate or something like that's a very real trauma and fear that I have. um that's something that you know i'm. i'm realizing is a big fear for me, and so I you know I actually cling on to people that I trust, because motor his career. Because yeah you sound like you're a very nice person, and I have this like bad history of like the people closest to me being like very, very. mean and cruel not intentionally, but like just by their their their their behaviors and their patterns, like my my mother yesterday barged into this House actually. And, and has no boundaries, and do you know what I mean and so. it's hard for me to also like one cause like yeah like bring up my my issues. And to now it's like my fear and worry is. You know just being like kind of tossed aside or or or assign somebody like from this organization that maybe has like some his like experience with you know, maybe childhood trauma or. whatnot and then. And then, and then being assigned like somebody that you know might not be as compassionate or might not connect with at all."
705.0,Provider,"You know I, I want to just validate how you philly and I get it with the fear and the lack of trust and especially with childhood trauma. I want to share with you that what i'm hearing you today, and when I hear how you're able to be assertive is this is good, this is growth. you're going to be able, if you meet someone else and you feel like it's not a good match, because this is, you know the person that you're going to interest in you're sharing with them. And you're being very vulnerable and so give yourself permission to explore and to be able to I mean this is like an interview of who am I going to work with, and this is and that's. I would encourage that again what you're doing today is healthy your we've have a connection, because I can see, you know that. you're here for a reason. don't let anything stop you it's like okay we've met, we are an option okay if you're feeling, though, like right now, you need more in support and you want to build on that bright heart health is still here. And that, being able to explore, you might be able to open up and be able to meet with someone that you never thought was maybe possible that, even more so, you feel a connection and like. i'm feeling like i'm confident and i'm comfortable and they specialize in childhood trauma, and this is, who I want to work with, because I have that feeling, but you won't know that until you are able to talk to maybe some others and that's Okay, people do that all the time."
14123.0,Patient,yeah um. I. I don't know if the issue is like like seeing somebody like in person in person. Maybe just because the experience itself is. It yeah I don't like I think it's I don't I think it's like should be okay to be online um. I. I can't tell at this point um yeah. they're awesome they're so so. yeah so. I don't know if the patient's you've worked with before like. yeah I don't I just.
705.0,Provider,"yeah if it's helpful I have worked with patients before that, before they came to bright heart health that they did call different places that they did explore. That they did ask different programs what it was about that's that's part of finding who you feel comfortable and who you're going to be able to start this journey with."
14123.0,Patient,Our I guess the majority of your patients like do they have like depression and like anxiety. or like. Or is it more like issues with specifically like being addicted to alcohol or something.
705.0,Provider,"I have a lot of sometimes people call it co occurring or adult diagnose where it's alcohol and it's some like bipolar or borderline or anxiety. Some depression, so I work with a mix l. You know, and what I usually do is from this assessment, like today it's like a lot of different questions we gather your history, and then we look at what would be probably the best treatment plan for you. And like you're addressing trauma would be one of them, that would be on there, and so, with that is being able to. A lot of times develop first coping skills that are healthy for you to help manage why you bring these things you know to surface and why you start talking about like the lack of trust and how that's. been something from childhood that you've brought into your adulthood, and how that affects you today, and so being able to first you know have some coping skills before you know. And then talking about okay here's here's my my next move, but this again I would like to reassure you that what you're doing and asking questions this is part of it. yeah you deserve to get the help that you need and that. That you meet up with who you feel most comfortable with."
14123.0,Patient,"I see yeah and you know I do feel. I do like feel like not like I feel like comfortable and I guess enough around you I don't know if that's i'm so sorry like I don't want to even sound like i'm like i'm just I guess being like transparent with like how I feel right now and what you just said, I guess you saying like. You know, part of the process is like asking a couple questions like we, I mean we we could maybe like. We could do that if if. If that's what it takes to determine like if the next steps are that you know you and I set up an appointment. or not, you know, or if it's with someone else, or if it like warrants like setting up another appointment like with you yeah I mean. yeah."
705.0,Provider,"Sure sure so l if you're okay with for today what I would like to do, then, is to reach out to the intake department. To have answered some of the questions like you're talking about working directly with a psychiatrist and just be able to answer that you know, for one, that question and others and then have them also. share with you some other resources that, then you can you can choose, if you want to call them just to explore what a little bit more, and then, if you feel comfortable to be able to schedule an appointment and then we'll we'll meet well we'll go through this again."
14123.0,Patient,"I think yeah I think right now i'm less than sit well like. I am I guess i'm I don't want to lose the line I have to this nurse right now, who is dispensing medication for me right now. Right I, so I don't want to lose that line to medication. route um so. That like and I guess what i'm wondering is more closely, like. associated with like just what would be a more effective form of like therapy right now. yeah yeah. Oh, my God. yeah and then um. I am going to grab some water if that's OK, and then and then i'm."
705.0,Provider,"Sure, so I wanted to l with your medication and I know that that's a concern for you, and so it wouldn't be like, if you choose to to you know, right now, you have your medications right for the week. yeah yeah Okay, and you know with that."
14123.0,Patient,that's like. swell. I yeah.
705.0,Provider,I have a lot of anxiety and.
14123.0,Patient,"And i'm wondering if that would be like the first like. I don't know if you know, like what ssri is do, or like a different types of ssri escape different effects I don't know if that's something that nurses at bright health are like really trained on and I don't I don't even know you know, like. A new thing for us is really important right. For for you, in the sense of I think you know. That we met with a nurse yesterday, and I was there, too, and I, he was really nice you you felt very caring and and and. yeah I think part that I think what you know he's he has a medication, but then she she. Basically, he the nurse didn't just do attacks on my stand side by side of things, but more than brushing her things and and that's something that you think enough of maybe trying to address and see if they could. Yesterday LG had a great conversation with our friend of mine that has been dealing with with excited for many years, and she revealed that there was something that she that she had been digging for a long time that really helped. And perhaps was on the La to run by by the nurse, but I think that the part of that because he's a nurse I use not maybe a psychologist that you're like whoa but will that will really know and to sell this thing like to feel comfortable that right, this is those things right yeah. You, but I feel like yeah. That was kind of yeah yeah yeah no that's."
705.0,Provider,"Okay, and with that to ella if you're okay with that i'm going to reach out to the intake department and then the email that we have for your intake is it Okay, if I send you, I want to send you some worksheets. there's some that are grounding techniques that are really good for anxiety and then one is a book on on the inside it and so just start to take a look, because. I know with anxiety builds up, and so what we know works is, if you can learn to interject it that will like lower that intensity and so i'm going to. go ahead and do that I will reach out to intake ask the questions that you know and get some answers for you and then have them, you know up to your discretion, if you would like to set up another appointment and we'll go for we'll go from there. But the way that you've handled this is to me very healthy and expect it you're new to this, this is all new to you. mm hmm more importantly don't give up get the help that you need right, this is just a way that you're exploring. Seeing what you're most comfortable with. And that is healthy."
14123.0,Patient,I appreciate that yeah.
705.0,Provider,Absolutely i'll so i'm going to have them reach out to you so you'll see when when they'll you know it will probably be I I would guess in the next hour or so that someone would reach out to you if that's okay.
14123.0,Patient,For for what so.
705.0,Provider,"What i'm going to do is ask them for referrals. If any type of referrals where you can maybe you know if you choose to explore and then also if you're you think about it, maybe you know can. talk a little bit, and if you decide that you want to schedule to do another assessment we can do that too, but just to give you some time where you're not feeling pressured there's there's not you know today it's not like a time limit okay. yeah and just give you a chance to to soak it all in maybe do a couple of deep breaths I don't know if you do any of them where you go in through the nose of four count like. And then out through the mouth for for count. Some time sometimes the deep breathing to with anxiety can help."
14123.0,Patient,uh huh.
705.0,Provider,"If you get used to that you can even were you doing in hell, and you, you go inhale. And then you hold it for four more seconds and then release and then push out for an extra four sometimes people call that box breathing and it's another technique that's just going to help you. Ground yourself be in the present and release a little bit of anxiety mm hmm so The good news is there are things that can help you with that. It just takes some time."
14123.0,Patient,"uh huh yeah yeah I think I like need to. I know I have. I, it would be nice to talk to somebody. yeah to get like I know i'm really depressed but I know that it's because i've been frozen for a long time now, because of the anxiety and so i'm. In that things it is pretty crippling or like making me feel really. frozen like not able to do much, so it will be i'm you know even thinking of setting up an appointment with the same nurse just to get a different prescription for the anxiety like after after after like. After this, and so I. I don't know like if you know you're mentioning the psychiatrists we do have your psychiatrist rather you might be talking to awesome yeah but that's not part of like Okay, but that's Okay, but that's something. You know that's the movie yeah but it's not. it's okay you don't have to be treated like it's just a clinic you know."
705.0,Provider,So l I will I will add to my message that you're you're requesting a possible medication to treat the anxiety is that what i'm hearing that you would like. yeah okay. And then that way they can speak to you about what that might look like because there's different ones.
14123.0,Patient,"Are these like the people that like are going to call like. Are they care navigators and I don't basically is that just admin to kind of assign you to take a different. way yeah, I think, like all the change and moving around that's for. yeah I mean at this point I don't I think that, within the bright House like you don't you can stay with a with a nurse that you know. A here's your we build a rapport with with this person and he was carrying and right it's because you are saying. Sending a request to change to us for for psychiatry Is that what you were thinking. I think for those are all very quick bass bass bass can changes to the you know I think like it's Okay, if you stay with with I say right for for the time being, I say is a nurse practitioner that was handling her medication."
705.0,Provider,"right and it wouldn't it wouldn't be. What I was going to relay wasn't that the switch to psychiatrists is just answering the question, if that is possibility. It was here in L that earlier that. You had some questions and my apologies, I wasn't able to answer is, if that is a possibility for you so being able to relay these types of questions. That can be directly answered where it's like Okay, and if, for now, if you're sharing that the nurse practitioner, you would like to stay with them, you want to take a look at the anxiety medication let's start from there."
14123.0,Patient,"yeah it medication and and and and and had depression, but I yeah."
705.0,Provider,"Okay, and then I will email you the different grounding techniques just take a look at it, and then the care navigator will reach out and then, if you like, because again. Part of with anxiety is the more that you feel overwhelmed and the more that you feel like that things are pressured and time limited it's like so just take it in small chunks take it in small action steps, this was really good. You got some of the answers some of them not and that this is a step."
14123.0,Patient,mm hmm yeah Thank you yeah.
705.0,Provider,"then take a break and I don't know if you drink, you know coffee or whatever your special drink is or something just. Get out for a few minutes just don't you know, try to try to just relax and then come back to it. yeah but give yourself permission to like take it easy."
14123.0,Patient,Okay yeah Thank you so much Valerie.
705.0,Provider,"you're very welcome and Nice to meet you know, and you know, again, I will go ahead and do with all that and no matter what I wish you the best and maybe i'll see you again, but our past may cross somewhere or the other right."
14123.0,Patient,"yeah yeah I may I don't know what this therapy thing is, I feel kind of dangling right now, maybe like maybe it would be good to schedule an appointment with you for like the following week or. A couple days from now, just to see where things went I have, I have no idea I don't know if that's."
705.0,Provider,"right would. Would you like to do that l would you, like me, I can pull up my calendar and set up a schedule, where we can do this again and then, in the event that you want to cancel you can cancel there's there's no worries there would that be helpful for you."
14123.0,Patient,"and yeah hold on i'm sorry just one moment please sure. I was, as I yeah I was anyway, I was just because you went to I wanted to ask you, so I know that the whole recording thing. Is is pretty insanely triggering and I and that's kind of a policy of how you guys work because of the transcription and whatnot I don't know if it's a liability thing or whatever, but it's, is it possible that these things are not recorded."
705.0,Provider,"I do get that l where it is with that we do use the recording and so part of my role is is to have it on it's more of not only for you know some of the things you mentioned, but for me it's more of looking at my techniques how am I sharing and is there anything I can do to improve."
14123.0,Patient,And there's and there's and it's not it's not shared with anyone elses it like.
705.0,Provider,"It if there is something within bright heart health like if you need it like something information, then we have the recording and then, after so many days the recordings are destroyed."
14123.0,Patient,"I guess yeah I guess my huge like thing is like you know with therapy sessions like you're guaranteed the patient to therapist confidentiality like I like I know that no one else will be looking at like anything i've said today, you know, like besides you. Just for hipaa compliance reasons right or not even that but just for like the the nutrition therapist confidentiality so. Is that that's I guess that's what i'm asking i'm wondering it like I just it wouldn't make sense for me, but anyone else besides, you would like see anything that we've talked about today, but it is that what you're. Is that what you're saying, or is that different than what the process I guess."
705.0,Provider,"Right it's I think Noel you had mentioned to about the transcribers so we do have people that that are not there they're looking at it for documentation and so they are documenting. Why we're running this tape it's encrypted so I know, sometimes people worry that if someone interjects as far as we're work as a team with bright heart health. So if there's anything that like a clinical Director will usually review the tapes to make sure like suicide, we have a lot of patients that are suicidal and to ensure that we're asking the right questions to assess for suicide. So that's that's where the viewing but outside of bright heart health, to answer your question no it's only as needed. Because they said help or not."
14123.0,Patient,"You will yeah The thing is that once you log into the sessions, and I mean just in as a viewer there's no really there's not really a. hurry saying an optional for consent be will be forgetting and talking to a person it's like it's kind of like do want to get into a meeting is recorded and say, yes or no there's no way so um if you're a question not to be recorded without be a thing or that will be a totally like. You know, like God have determined that she can work or not we brought her health."
705.0,Provider,"yeah again I don't know the clear answer to that, and so what i'm going to do is refer, and I can I can find out for you, for me, my role is I, I have to have the recording on it's what I do for groups it's what I do for each individual. If you were saying that you don't want it record it, I will ask them with that."
14123.0,Patient,request the question.
705.0,Provider,"Okay, so i'm gonna go ahead and with the questions that we wrote down and then i'm going to go ahead and relay them and then the email i'll send out the email. And then we'll go from there. Again, I hope that today you're able just to take a break from it all L and then come back and be able to like Okay, you know so. no time limit on it today why don't we go ahead and I will ask all those questions i'll have a care navigator reach out to you and then just if it's helpful to. write down, like some of the pros and cons that's when i'm making a decision I like to write down pros and cons, this is why I may stay, this is why I may feel I need to explore more and that's okay. Okay, because this is about true okay."
14123.0,Patient,"Okay, and and and. yeah so okay yeah Thank you, I really appreciate that Valerie you I, and I you've been super kind I guess the guy just the whole way that, for her health works is like def definitely different than a normal therapists session, as you can, as you know, like."
705.0,Provider,"yeah it is, it is different L and that's where you know again some some really like it. Some people are kind of like in between it just depends, and so the more that you get to know it, I think the better, so you know again i'm glad that you're being assertive and getting your needs met okay."
14123.0,Patient,"Okay, how long has it been like in operations like and."
705.0,Provider,"You know, with that I, I want to say I don't want to misquote it I know it's been here for a bit, I want to say at least 10 years but with that I can get somebody with the more accurate with that l. Okay well what i'm going to do, then i'll go ahead and do everything we talked about, and then we'll go from there okay. Okay okay."
14123.0,Patient,"Okay, thanks so much."
705.0,Provider,Thank you.
14123.0,Patient,yeah I appreciate it.
705.0,Provider,Thank you.
14123.0,Patient,Take care.
705.0,Provider,"Patient and sure if she would like to join bright heart health she's having some questions, and so I will reach out to care navigators and we'll go from there."
