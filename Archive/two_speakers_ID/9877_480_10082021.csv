9877.0,Patient,"Just you know dealing with some boys is you know their grandmother loops taking it pretty hard, but he told me he was going to come up this weekend, but it keeps changing his mind, and I really wanted to see him because he's he's getting distant and I like that. He didn't take the. The same road, though, that eyes, it took you know with. heroin. So he don't even drink."
480.0,Provider,me isaac's currently on heroin.

9877.0,Patient,Oh yeah he's on maintenance.
480.0,Provider,"Okay, good."
9877.0,Patient,"Good yeah he. yeah he sees him as his own therapist and. But he's i'm afraid because of the way he's been acting that. He might try to read that. Because he's been hanging out with. ended up he's never ever gotten in trouble, and never had. Any kind of record, but this guy that girl that he hooked up with that started the amount heroin he wasn't ever shooting up he was smoking it. Okay, and. She. Oh God money, I could beat the brakes off her."
480.0,Provider,Bad influence haha.
9877.0,Patient,"yeah but uh he ended up. His dad and his uncle's and them have their own big construction business and his buddy stole bike over $13,000 worth of equipment from his dad's uncle and. Isaac got in trouble for accessory after the fact."
480.0,Provider,"Okay, so like trouble with the criminal system."
9877.0,Patient,"Yes, and. I told him I told his dad I said you guys could drop the charges, because if not he's going to end up facing two years in prison. yeah and so his recruiter is talking to him. His best option would be to you know them work with him and he get back into the marines."
480.0,Provider,and not a possibility at this point. That would be good.
9877.0,Patient,"That would be great, and the only thing is, is. Is that and then could drop the charges, but his dad said he needs to learn a lesson and I said Come on, Brian this is going to ruin his whole life."
480.0,Provider,"Well, especially if he could get back into the marines where you know that he's disciplined he's like being kind of babysat in a way, you know, then it's not like you're just giving him a pass and letting him go do whatever he wants to do."
9877.0,Patient,"mm hmm because. it's I mean the state didn't take it over because his whole family they own half they own the majority of the county that we. All graduated from this one, how to move away from there because it's all about his family and he. Just aggravates me because my name is still on the House and stuff and I told him I said well we'll put the House up and getting a good attorney. and his page just. Brian that's, all I can say he's just. an ass so."
480.0,Provider,So when is he looking at facing these charges if they go through.
9877.0,Patient,"Right now, they keep continuing it. Oh, and. yeah and I think right now he's gonna just be on because he can't leave the state, because he can't he can't come up here and I know him and Sam are wanting to have. he's getting married. engaged to cement then she's a really good girl, I, like her."
480.0,Provider,"Okay, so she's not the same one that introduced him."
9877.0,Patient,"To heroin no. No, no she's really she's really good girl and Isaac already has three kids. I three different mothers."
480.0,Provider,he's got he he's like mid 20s.
9877.0,Patient,"mm hmm. yeah okay yeah and now I was like well not three by eight he's got vicki and he's got. What is her name, because I don't never speak with her, but he had when he went into the military, she was pregnant and we weren't never sure if. I was hurt he is or not, and he."
480.0,Provider,Never did a test.
9877.0,Patient,"No he doesn't look like the rest, I mean he didn't look like Nova and D so to me. I don't know. I mean vicki's you know rehab and everything, but she didn't go to rehab like like Isaac did as when done, the whole thing the right now he's on probation So hopefully, but he pays like. Like over $600 and child for the month and then pays his funds, so these things right now, since it was his first charge and. The magistrate and everyone there and the county knows ron's family So hopefully he's just gonna have to pay and beyond, for his own supervised probation I mean can't you can't leave the state or anything so."
480.0,Provider,wow.
9877.0,Patient,"I know I never ever thought that whenever he called me and told me that and then Brian had to say what he said, like I said yesterday, well, one of our boys had to turn out just like you get me I was like wow okay."
480.0,Provider,Thank you yeah that's a low blow. Do you still talk to Brian frequently.
9877.0,Patient,"mm hmm. I call him we talked. A couple months ago, because I was like what do you want to do and. The acid, you know cuz my I mean when he got remarried he didn't stay married long. He didn't really I think her main thing was she wanted to take him, you know, for whatever he had, and all this and so she couldn't do that when she found that my name was telling everything so she wasn't real happy about that."
480.0,Provider,wow. that's really sad.
9877.0,Patient,"We never went to court for equitable distribution or anything, though she he he was really appreciative of that because yeah she she was pistol shooting anything. yeah man her got into it to beat the crap out of her because. She they we went camping and Isaac ID card, because he wanted to go home well they found that we were camping and she grabbed Luke and threw him into the car and before I even knew it I come across car and beat the. crap out of her buster known. As a said looks been telling me even me and being to him, I said and Brian obviously and going to do anything about it so."
480.0,Provider,let's look at the time.
9877.0,Patient,He was seven.
480.0,Provider,Oh yeah oh.
9877.0,Patient,"And he was like I don't want to go, I want to say a mom and man's like getting a car and misty grabbed him and. push him into the car and I was like Oh, you did not you're not gonna touch my son like that I said Luke has been telling me they don't want to play soccer anymore, he wants to play baseball. And she's making him do these things, and he doesn't want to do it, so I told Luke I gave him a reporter. And he started recording how she was to him and Brian was like hey get out of my life. You, finally, believe me any apologize."
480.0,Provider,yeah oh my gosh that's awful i'm glad she wasn't in the kid's life very long.
9877.0,Patient,"yeah no, thank God."
480.0,Provider,"So what Luke was supposed to come, this weekend what's his reasoning for maybe not coming."
9877.0,Patient,"and His main thing is, is that he Luke is a pro angler and he used all about his dogs he hunts Turkey hands all that kind of stuff and he gets you know, like the trophies and stuff for it."
480.0,Provider,Oh cool.
9877.0,Patient,"So i'm in Florida he came to see me all the time, because I lived on Lake okeechobee some of the best fishing there was, and he likes to saltwater fish, and we would go and I told him I said I live five minutes from like norris I mean. Go here. He was like oh yeah so. The last time it was his water pump out on his truck so us any money to fix that. And he. Still ended up not coming, but I think since his nanny is gone now it's kind of. He needs to fill that void. Again, so. I think you'll come, but another way another one, is that when he brought his girlfriend down to Camp last year or the year before that, before we moved up here. eddie show his ass and was really, really. A jerk in front of his girlfriend's family, and it was embarrassing and they ended up going rogue one learns to stay instead of staying for free at our Marina and. yeah he doesn't care for it."
480.0,Provider,yeah that makes sense. Any going to be around this weekend.
9877.0,Patient,Oh yeah.
480.0,Provider,"yeah bummer so he decides to come if Luke decides to come, can you and loop, though, like do something without eddie or is it."
9877.0,Patient,"going to bomb I said why don't we. Go to. You know there's all kinds of little cabin places here there's marinas there got little condos we could all go in together and he will you know be you said. And she has her insurance check that just came so I know mom would would would pay forward if she if they were for sure come to see as if he can't come because you can't leave the state so. Right, and you know I haven't even got to see my new grandbaby yet so."

Whenever that happened, they were taken to our wiki sister we couldn't beat them to the punch line like you know it's the first one to get their family member and, of course, her sister was already right there, so we couldn't get there in time or we would have. We would have got him."

Another infusion for my Ms because they got to find the right one, like oprah I couldn't take because I resorted to so they got to try to find one and treated aggressively so they said, probably the best thing because it's progressing so fast is chemo."

I didn't want to be hearing more and i'm gonna lie, I thought about. Killing myself. Because the. Now I would like to shake and just. I just wish they could just feel I don't want to wish it on them, but I just wish that they could feel just for five minutes how my skin feels and how I feel like my I have to put my hands in in ice in my feet, then put those. Those things which could much boxes on my feet in behind my eyes if. I wanted to. just get away from my own body in a way, and I just I just laid in there and I said I don't want to be here anymore i'm going to have to go to us but i'm going to flip out."
480.0,Provider,yeah. What do you. Do aside from ice in those flare ups like Is there something you can take to ease the burning and the pain.

9877.0,Patient,"yeah I don't want to not want to deal with it anymore like it's not fair it's and then I do things to get my mind off of it, but it just feels like I just wish so bad because eddie's got a friend at work, his wife has Ms. And she is already in a wheelchair, and he trust you know him and eddie talk or whatever, but it is like, if I have days, I have a tea and I get real tired, but i'm still expected to to push through and do my chores. I can, I can. he'll be off and. He goes just because i'm off doesn't mean you are."

I would say, physical pain and Ms flare ups are your two big warning signs right for suicidal ideation."
9877.0,Patient,and getting. Just feeling.
480.0,Provider,Like feeling invalidated by the people around you. yeah I.
9877.0,Patient,Like I like the nobody wants me around or or i'm just a burden.

9877.0,Patient,Recording. This my family.
480.0,Provider,"And last thing. Do you when you're feeling this way I know you said, the plan would be to drive into something so in order to protect yourself from doing that do you like hide your keys tell yourself, you can't go driving right now."
9877.0,Patient,"Oh no I mean I periodically think about that just driving down the road, but I don't I would never do it."
480.0,Provider,So do you feel like your car is your safest place environmentally. The car you use.
9877.0,Patient,"My car is gone and. I would, I wouldn't never really I wouldn't drive into a light Pole, but I thought about just randomly dumb stuff like jumping off a bridge, and you know just random thoughts."
480.0,Provider,"Well, and the thing is so suicidal ideation is pretty. i'm. Pretty common the important part, is knowing that you have protective factors meaning, you have reasons to live, you can see, the big picture, know that you know the pain is going to go away or whatever it is."
9877.0,Patient,I just wish I could get out of. Out of my own head.
480.0,Provider,yeah.

9877.0,Patient,But then mom finds it and she's like when you were when you write this kind of dark stuff and but then she finds my other ones and she's like your composition teacher told you not to ever stop writing.
480.0,Provider,"Writing is like one of the best therapy. Coping skills, I feel like because there's so much. For me, when I write it's like it gives me a new perspective because i'm getting the thoughts out of my head i'm seeing them on paper and then it's easy for me to shift perspectives, while i'm writing yep. So I think it's a really helpful coping skill."
9877.0,Patient,I. Believe it's already been an hour.
480.0,Provider,"and always goes by so fast, I do have you down."

9877.0,Patient,Every everybody. Everybody was like. I know still I don't know I think natalie kind of acts like a hoity toity.
480.0,Provider,"personalities are tricky. it's so something that I like about group dynamics is, you have the opportunity to practice coping skills, because certain people's personalities can be triggering. Which is why I think group therapy is so great, because it's like you get to put into action the things you're learning, because people will. unintentionally trigger you, you know."
9877.0,Patient,Maybe its intention. nevermind.
480.0,Provider,"Oh well, I hope you enjoy your weekend and your week and I will talk to you well i'll see what group and then we'll have our next appointment next Friday."
