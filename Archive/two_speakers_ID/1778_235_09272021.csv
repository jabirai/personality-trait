235.0,Provider,Are they comfortable.
1778.0,Patient,"Oh, at first, no, I could not eat and I could not deal, but after I would say, maybe a month and a half. Maybe two months I finally got a grip on accepting them in my mouth. Because that's The worst thing is having like this foreign thing in your mouth. All day and even I was even talking differently so you have to kind of even learn how to talk again."
235.0,Provider,"allows you to smile and be relaxed and your. You know, and when you smile your smile your you know it makes you younger and more vibe you know just it's a whole different deal, you know I mean."
1778.0,Patient,"you're so right, I mean, I have to tell you it, not only is making me smile again but it made me go on a weight loss journey, because I had been overweight, since I hit menopause and not been able to. Get the weight off, and I was so discouraged, because I was told incorrectly by. Someone in my family that if you're on suboxone you know it slows down your your metabolic systems and you won't be able to lose weight and I just kind of accepted that without. You know, looking into it or but I finally went on a you know I wouldn't say it's a diet, because it's a way I cut out all sugar and. You know, carbohydrates and lesser from vegetables, and I am telling you I have lost 30 pounds already and it's only been a few months."
235.0,Provider,Your your your chin and neck and. Everything is more yeah help.
1778.0,Patient,Thank you.
235.0,Provider,"You know the and I can't give you a good barometer because last time I seen was like four months ago, whatever five months and it was just like oh man i'm waiting on this to get done, and you know it was just like. is so this is exciting."
1778.0,Patient,"It really is, I guess, when I got new teeth It made me kind of care about myself again or something. I don't know. But and it's not true that you know I know suboxone has side effects, but you can lose weight, while you're on it and I don't I can't believe I just accepted that."
235.0,Provider,"You know, with that regard I never heard that suboxone would give you the munchies like you gotta you know, like marijuana or something you know I just. I didn't know about that you know that's first time I heard it but i'm glad that you know we've never really discussed that before in a group topic isn't that something I think i'll bring that up and grew up. With some folks I think that's a really good topic."
1778.0,Patient,"It really is because it made me not even try to lose weight for a very long time, and now I realize I can you know. You know so there's like miss I would call them the myths of this medication. that people will hear and they'll just accept accepted as fact like I did. And when it's not true and and it's just you know i'm such a happier person i'm still have a couple more pounds to lose but. I couldn't I couldn't believe it was working I just couldn't believe it so you know it's like my whole life has changed and I i've even starting to you know take vitamins and minerals and I really didn't do that before."
235.0,Provider,That is so cool and you probably feel better than you felt in years right now.
1778.0,Patient,"Oh, my gosh you know my pain situations because my background is from chronic pain, which is what got kind of got me into this whole mess in the first place. I started looking into you know the natural kind of their spices there's there's roots for inflammation because that's what I have, I have. Not only my injury from my surgeries, but I have arthritis and I don't know, I was diagnosed with that now i'm like how did I get arthritis I i'm only like 52 I mean I thought old old people got arthritis but. You know. How am I, how do I have that in my hips and in my knee how do I have that I don't know but it's painful, at times, but I discovered that taking turmeric and ginger root and devil's claw there's so many natural things that you can take and it reduces."
235.0,Provider,don't forget magnesium either.
1778.0,Patient,You know.
235.0,Provider,"You could take that as like the salts with a call that I. Think IT staff, so let me take a look, I think she has some over here. Okay yeah it's epson salt, you heard of that right that you put in your bathtub and you bathe."
1778.0,Patient,yeah that you kind of soak it.
235.0,Provider,"For that's kind of that's got magnesium but my aunt was a big. Big on all those things, and she lived to be 90 she was in the curcumin and all those different types of herbs, just like what you do."
1778.0,Patient,"Oh, my gosh it's like a whole new world is open up to me because before I would be like Oh well, that's ridiculous, you know some spices are not gonna help me, you know, but you know i'm like well Teresa just try it because you you didn't think you could lose weight either you know."
235.0,Provider,"So what's what's the verdict, what do you think since you've been trying."
1778.0,Patient,"Oh, is make such a difference it like takes down the inflammation in my joints to where you know it doesn't hurt it'll take the pain away in your joints. If you're consistent, you know I pretty much take them every day, and after about two weeks i'm like oh my gosh I can't believe this is actually working like there's i'm taking roots and spices and herbs and it's it's helping me. So I just kind of you know, become a believer now just because it's working on me, whereas I would have never even considered. stuff like that."
235.0,Provider,sure. Brian is a doctor pachter or is it.
1778.0,Patient,"it's Dr pachter. And you know what have you talked to him because he's big on the stuff that you do he's. I never really it never clicked to me, except for one time, he told me to take something perimenopause and I, I mean i'm like Okay, maybe i'll try it. But I never took it seriously before and I remember in the past, he would he even gave me a you know, a name of something to take, because I was having. sweats not only at night, but in the middle of the day, i'd be sitting in the office and all of a sudden i'm dripping in sweat and he on my face because of the menopause and i'm like wait a minute he even told me a long time ago, you know what to take for that."
235.0,Provider,"Right and what to take for migraines what to take for all kinds of different stuff different types of herbs and teas that you could use. And really big on mindfulness, as you know, and meditation and. You know, he lives super healthy, you know him and his family so i'm i'm excited for you, what is your daughter think of this what's what's."
1778.0,Patient,"On both supportive she is she's excited about mostly the weight loss, because she knows how it affects my confidence and had in the past, you know, and she told me that oh my gosh mom you are, you are so much more. of yourself now, and she says, I now that I kind of look at people more when I talked to them."
235.0,Provider,yeah I.
1778.0,Patient,"didn't realize, I was you know not doing that she said, or I would go like this, a lot. Sure, like that. So the combination of you know, losing the weight and feeling better you know just when you have control over your pain your life is different. You know, because with me with the suboxone I know they told me at first, that there is a pain component, where it will treat pain it's supposed to you know help with pain, as well as your cravings but for me. I think i'm doing this other thing with the with the natural remedies is helping my pain more and the suboxone is helping me to not crave anything that's how it works for me, you know, maybe it works for pain on on other people more but."
235.0,Provider,"What you're doing there with. With the with the herbs and your your no no whites no carbs diet. Yes, and then your attitude, you know your positive attitude and kind of feeling all around better about yourself and your help. it's like wow what a difference, you know, like you know, life is life is so much better, and I could you know I don't know where you are, as far as you know. relationships or whatever how that goes, but if you're ready, you know if you know mango or anybody from the Church, you know if you're back fellowship and I don't know that's."
1778.0,Patient,"Well, you know."
235.0,Provider,kind of.
1778.0,Patient,My I tell my kids this that i'm married to Jesus just because i'm so i've had two marriages. yeah and worked out and. I don't know so I just kind of live from my kids pretty much so.
235.0,Provider,"Just to give you an encouragement I don't mean to interrupt you, but my mom and my stepdad. They both had three marriages. Oh, they they they were happily married for over 30 years."
1778.0,Patient,and
235.0,Provider,"There was like an 18 year age gap, he was 18 years older than her. But it just worked out fantastic you know so don't give up keep praying the Lord will bring that guy into your life, you know it's when it's the right time and but. It just the you're taking good care of the temple of the Holy Spirit and that's."
1778.0,Patient,"exactly right that's, the main thing we're supposed to do and. I just never realized how much you know I wasn't before until I see the difference that you can actually you know wake up in the morning and know that it's going to be okay. And it was i'm worried i'm not worried so much about the medication, either because I was always worried I got a taper down I gotta get down i'm never gonna. You know."
235.0,Provider,"about the spot, I don't even think you know what that's meant to happen it'll happen be incrementally and i'll be. Doc will just step you down little bit at a time, but you know it's if I don't take my certain meds I don't live I need to have a connect to be and i'm so thankful for modern medicine now. You know a lot of people they are able to function in life just fine on this box and But some people are able to to do the whole tapering thing, so I mean. And down the road apiece but don't. Yes, I don't want to tell you what not unit, you know, I just want to kind of encourage you to go, you know just kind of pray about it."
1778.0,Patient,"Exactly i'm not worried so much anymore about that, because I, I feel like I have my pain under control, and I can lose weight and those were the two main things in my life there were huge for me, you know."
235.0,Provider,The huge thing was that your mouth is feeling better.
1778.0,Patient,"Oh, my God."
235.0,Provider,"You know, once once that healed up and you didn't have any inflammation or you know I mean cuz that's so dangerous because you can get suspicious, you can get all kinds of nauseous stuff when you get infection and now that you got all that cleared away and. You know. it's just it's goddess good."
1778.0,Patient,"Right, you did it. Good that's exactly right and everything kind of goes, you know it was happening good at one time, you know it's like just these last couple months. Everything good is happening to me so."
235.0,Provider,"you're gonna happen, I mean obedience you're being disciplined. yeah you know you're you're embracing it like one of I remember one of the people that I have privileged to work with she was saying. And I might have said this in our group before, but I really think it's true her first three years of sobriety she was white knuckling it like you. know is a real stressor and then she just ended up embracing and she says the last three years, have been such a blessing and she's a believer to, and you know she enjoys work and she you know everything is sent to the Lord and. You know, life is so much better, you know when when that surrender surrender surrender to him takes place, you know complete."
1778.0,Patient,backley and i'm so thankful that you can understand that you know i'll get on that same level with me that you know that's where i'm coming from you know and give God all the glory for everything. You know.
235.0,Provider,"The craziness that's going on, you know I mean just like he's we see all i'd say you know a lot of people say if God is so good we're all the same, what we live in a fallen world."
1778.0,Patient,And you know he's patient and.
235.0,Provider,"gracious and he's not forcing any you know anything upon you it's it's your you have that free gift of grace to receive that gift that that he gives you through Jesus. And the thing is, is that you got. it's like the surrender right just need to surrender yourself to to him, and when that really happens, I mean that's when good stuff happens in our life, as you will go."
1778.0,Patient,"Through you know, the only thing that has me, you know a little sad is my kids have not, you know embraced like I have. Christ and i'm not the kind of person that would force them to come to church with me, I would never force them, you know my thing is like I want to teach them everything I know and hope that they choose, it, you know because. I don't know, I just want my kids to be you know believe the same way and have the same you know core ethics, that I do and. I don't know. Really, they will, but maybe you know they're teenagers so they're not gonna."
235.0,Provider,"You know years it's a tough deal, but I, you know his word will not return on to him void and."
1778.0,Patient,that's true.
235.0,Provider,"You know the kids were raised in the church right they went to. youth groups and stuff like that, so they know that you they know they know Jesus. Now what what, what can you know when when you got all those hormones flying and. That can be 13 to 93 it just depends, you know what i'm saying it's or not I didn't word that right, but but younger, you know. The world just gets in the waves it's very distracting and it's appealing to the flesh right."
1778.0,Patient,it's right.
235.0,Provider,"we're walk spirit, not by power, but by my spirit says."
1778.0,Patient,"I mean there's so much oh I didn't even tell you I had to we pulled samantha out of public school, you know how they went back to school and person this year. The kids well I don't. i'm not sure if you remember about the bullying she experienced in. Before and."

A month and a half, maybe a month and a half ago and oh my gosh so we have her an online school now because she doesn't want to go back and. I asked her to go, she has a therapist and the therapist was like well you know don't try to rescue her, she needs to face her fears and and I even asked her. You know, we can you can go back and we can figure something out with the principal and everything, but she didn't want to go back because she wanted to do online school, so I let her."
235.0,Provider,"You know I, and I totally agree with that i'll tell you why because. We live in a different paradigm than when you and I went to school."
1778.0,Patient,Oh.
235.0,Provider,And socialization is important and i'm not saying that you know totally isolate yourself and beyond on the computer the whole time.
1778.0,Patient,Right.
235.0,Provider,"Some people are good at learning this way they're not distracted others they need that you know they need to be around their peers all the time. And this way she could kind of. keep a good boundary away from people that are toxic in her life and not be around them, and when she's ready to go to college, you know pray about the schooling, that you do and even do some classes online there too."
1778.0,Patient,"Yes, yes."
235.0,Provider,select the people who she's going to hang with and not get built bullied like that.
1778.0,Patient,"Exactly, and let me tell you. Now that she's been on like her she's getting straight a's I don't even get it i'm like really that's great so she's adapting really well to it and she's doing just fine."

1778.0,Patient,"So on the upward trajectory. No, but."
235.0,Provider,Going how's work oh.
1778.0,Patient,"it's great it's wonderful, the only bad thing you know my son I don't know if you remember, but he has epilepsy. yeah and he had another seizure, the other day, which was really, really bad."
235.0,Provider,Which one was it was a grandma.
1778.0,Patient,"Yes, that's the only kind he has, for some reason I don't know why but uh."
235.0,Provider,"You know, coming on, though."
1778.0,Patient,He see he doesn't he comes with any sleep. And we always it happens when it's the middle of the night. And then we hear him banging against the wall his bed as long and apparently we figured out that the day before. Yet for. him to take his dose. And you can just miss even one even one dose of medication I don't know with everybody.
235.0,Provider,"But no, I totally get it, I can't sleep if I don't take a certain mad that even though i'm stepping down off of it if I if I go to bed, and I forget about taking it. yeah why you know why are you going to sleep it's like 1231 o'clock what Oh, you know I forgot to take my MED."
1778.0,Patient,"Absolutely, I mean I was kind of shocked, you know one dose and he's gonna have a grand seizure, you know but yes that's what happened so we're just got to be trying to be extra careful and I got him one of those little peel boxes that have Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday. Yes. And so you know there's no reason that he can. Forget but the sad thing is, is that he's epilepsy doctor he's just barely getting his driver's license. And he's got all the way past is written, he just he's done all the hours and he asked to take his actual driver's test dmv and she suspended his license and she says, well, I want him to go three months, with no seizures and then i'll consider reinstating you know is."
235.0,Provider,i'm thankful that she considered I totally understand where she's coming from.
1778.0,Patient,"I know, and I do."
235.0,Provider,"prayers on, but I think it's I think that's real a lot of wisdom. because she wants to make sure he's not going to be a threat for himself and and to other people so that'll be a good indicator."
1778.0,Patient,"ugly exactly, and I think this is going to make him feel like oh man I better take these meds every day or it's affecting my life here."
235.0,Provider,Actually I think it's a good wake up call and kind of seeing the correlation say yeah it really does work so.
1778.0,Patient,"Yes, yes."

235.0,Provider,"Well, you know it's funny I was with one of the other therapists and he was helping me with some of the. Logistics as far as working you know, setting up certain things that I have a little i'm a little slow on or whatever, and he you know i'm like a softy compared to some of them it's like. Really, you know, using an end he's he's right on on a lot of it, you know, and I, I need but. Not to come down hard, because I feel like each each case, of course, is different, you know when you use the where they call it. artificial intelligence Ai. Yes, correlate everything it doesn't work that way each person, you have to you, form a specific treatment plan for each one. And you come down to basically four types, you have those that need higher level of care either that they're so chronically ill or you know, chronic pain or their sickness that you know they're not a fit for telemedicine, or their you know their chronic pain regular chronic pain patients. In the one that is. You know it's harm reduction, all this harm reduction, but basically it's the one that's not proactive they're hanging out in mom and dad's basement. And not doing much else but they're staying sober not you know, being a detriment to society, then there's a proactive ones that are getting out there. There you know, raising families or they're being productive members of society, and you know. So I kind of look I kind of graded like that, and just see where each person is that you know and just kind of go in and you know be praying I proved before each you know each group and each person, you know."
1778.0,Patient,"So and it's nice when someone really can understand me and where i'm coming from a makes such a difference, you know."
