2144.0,Patient,yeah no rain.
126.0,Provider,"No rain, no. To too bad California, I mean it seems like we would have plenty of water, we were like we're right next to the ocean. You know they have desalinization plants in Israel that's where all their water comes from. lissa desalinization plant that's where they take the salt out of the ocean water and converted into drinking water. they've been doing that for like 50 years."
2144.0,Patient,Oh really I don't know.
126.0,Provider,How I don't understand why we're not doing that.
2144.0,Patient,hmm.
126.0,Provider,"It doesn't make any sense, no, we we keep building more and more and more and more. And our water supply is going down and yeah did it's very expensive to build one of those desalinization plants, but I don't know they've got like four or five in Israel and that's when people have been drinking ever since they moved there."
2144.0,Patient,wow.
126.0,Provider,"I mean you don't hear about a water shortage in Israel, which is in the middle of the desert."
2144.0,Patient,yeah. that's crazy yeah.

2144.0,Patient,yeah. yeah good.
126.0,Provider,Good what is there anything that you feel like you're kind of struggling with or it's like a challenge for you.
2144.0,Patient,"Just right now. With my nerves and stuff not knowing what's going on with that and. huh I feel better with the new medication I started for my ptsd nightmares and stuff so that's really helped with my nerves. And will I started again to okay everything's trend started on one is again like I was really like when I was off of promotion, which is the one for my ptsd. And it's like my brain was detached my body, I would just associate like with my senses, we get overwhelmed. And I would like my body was my brain, which is like detached from my body, I was just in fight or flight mode all the time. And I would never calm down, I never felt like normal like my body was like numb and it's just really bizarre I just was always going going going. Now I feel like I can relax and more i'm really more attached myself, now that I have ever been just great excellent I have this problem with my nerves, and my muscles where my muscles crap they twitch a lot. And they spasm and then. there. And like I can't regulate my body temperature, or they just get pins and needles all over. So I have something weird going on with me physically but. um yeah I don't know what that is."
126.0,Provider,"And as far as for sure wanted to ask, are you going to any outside counseling for the ptsd."
2144.0,Patient,No.
126.0,Provider,Do you think you should.
2144.0,Patient,yeah.
126.0,Provider,"I think that's a good idea if you can you know, find a counselor. That your insurance would cover. yeah yeah I think that's a really, really good idea, because you know you got to look at it like this, the ptsd yes you're on medicine, but can you help it even more, and you help you know kind of maybe get the pts smaller and get you know, Brittany bigger kind of thing. yeah and you know i'm a drug and alcohol counselor I don't I don't know how to work through our process ptsd but."
2144.0,Patient,"If you gave us, who I am Dr Dr I keep trying to get in but every time I try to get in something happens and I can't get into fear, like the call and cancel or the Council didn't go through or something."
126.0,Provider,"um you know they ended up the lady who was doing the em Dr she ended up leaving and another lady is now doing it. Oh i'm can't remember her name, but I will try to figure out what i'll ask somebody what her name is and then send her. A recommendation seems I I did that, with the other lady right and that was the one you never got a chance to Okay, so this is somebody else. But again, we only have one, and I think everybody's like dying to see her. that's apparently how good she is. But i'll send a. Recommendation and say that you know I I would. You know, really, I am referring, you to her and hopefully. Okay she'll have one of the care navigators call you and make a make an appointment."
2144.0,Patient,That would be great.
126.0,Provider,"Okay. All right, I do want you to look in on you know outside counseling for the ptsd. Okay, we look at. look into that and see your area. Okay they'll probably do it by zoom anyway, so you don't have to worry about driving. Oh yeah I mean still most things are being done that way it's just now it's turning out to be way more you know convenient, especially if they don't have to dispense any medication to you."
2144.0,Patient,yeah.
126.0,Provider,So you probably do it on zoom so that won't be a big deal okay yeah. So any do you feel like you've had. Like just the last couple of weeks setbacks versus success.
2144.0,Patient,"No, not really I mean. My sobriety goes no. setbacks financially but that's uh."
126.0,Provider,"Have you I know you went on. into the in the rooms before have you done that recently. Okay, all right, I was hoping it would help you and that you would you know just want to go back just because you thought it was awesome but apparently you don't think it's so. um. Anything that you're working on, as far as like some goals are. Things you want to achieve short term long term goals."
2144.0,Patient,"Know really just get look at our own place for now we're living with his parents and it's really hard so. Many to get out and get our own place right now. he's working he makes you makes all right, money and it's just. haven't been able to do it, we have, we have to apply for hud."
126.0,Provider,system yeah.
2144.0,Patient,Let me a river. yeah so. we're doing that.
126.0,Provider,"yeah if they have a long wait list, but you know what you, you should apply anyway, because a lot of people drop out and you move up to the top of the list."
2144.0,Patient,"So when I was living at my dad that got approved for her, but then my dad so I couldn't make it so I mean i'm going through with this and that stupid."
126.0,Provider,mm hmm.
2144.0,Patient,I kind of had my own place. Right and I listened to him do it.
126.0,Provider,yeah.
2144.0,Patient,"Well, the waitlist for hardly for not that long at all, but actually I might have been on it for a year, but. yeah anyway."
126.0,Provider,"yeah that's not long at all there's people that have been on it, you know six or seven years or. Why. there's a waiting list it's just don't get discouraged by. How much time they say that it'll take because people drop off the list so you could be number 15 and all the people that called before you have already moved or they're in another State or. You know so i've done that many times, where i've like put my kids on a waitlist to get into a particular school and they're like oh you're number 30 what. And I end up getting called so I just always. Do it and then just cross my fingers, you know hope I get called. yeah one of my patients from another group she's on hud housing she lives in like downtown sacramento in a four bedroom house and she's only paying like $600 a month. wow yeah. it's got like five kids. yeah. But it's it's a nice House so yeah you can get some nice housing, you know just depends. Who you're working with. huh but yeah it definitely get on the list it doesn't hurt. um so anything on your mind that you. want to discuss or."
2144.0,Patient,"No, sorry."
126.0,Provider,"Okay, all right well at least they're quiet. When other kids come in the room, you here i'm talking and yelling and I can just tell every time your eyes, though yeah.
