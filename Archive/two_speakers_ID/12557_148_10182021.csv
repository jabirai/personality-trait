148.0,Provider,i'm.
12557.0,Patient,Good but I got it.
148.0,Provider,"Oh, you did."
12557.0,Patient,yeah yeah because I want to prep myself for the holidays already. You know. mm hmm yeah um so I had a good week and my mom came back from Spain yesterday. We celebrated her birthday so.
148.0,Provider,That.
12557.0,Patient,"It was nice it was just us my siblings and our kids and grandkids and. It was good, it was the first time we've been together what all of us it's hard to it's hard for me my sister and my brother to get together at the same time, you know so that was really nice and a bit of slow it really sad news, but I talked about in group on Fridays that i'm. Our pet dog passed away Thursday night. But she was really like my dad's baby."
148.0,Provider,"So you can you briefly talked about it, the last time we met i'm so sorry to."
12557.0,Patient,"yeah and it was. It. i'm i'm worried about my father just he he deals terribly with like grief and death. And he and i'm similar to him and we don't really talk about our emotions and we just sort of hold things in and. She like ignoring them makes them go away, you know so that's what he's doing and then my brother for some reasons that it was okay to come by Saturday morning with a new puppy for him and I was like that's really nice, but I think it's way too early. And that's exactly what happened, like my dad is like no I don't want any more pets I can't handle it and he just straight up walked out of the House and. went to the backyard because. We buried lonnie in the backyard. He went to the backyard and started talking to the lonnie and I was like Oh, this is bad. This is not good, and my mom never wanted pets ever even with lonnie she complained about her every day. And so we didn't tell my mom yesterday. About. Then you puppy you know we just put her down to nap went to have our are like late lunch with my mom. came back she was in my daughter's room and a little baby play Ping napping and it was just like I can't keep this a secret for my mother. But no one else wants to no one wants to tell her. Right, except for my my great niece who has like she loves to tattle pray. she's. she's five right and she she talks a whole lot she's like very sassy you know. So yesterday, she started telling my mom like why don't you go look at the new puppy and I was like. Because my mom is like she's loud, you know she's very she's very expressive too much so that's why everyone didn't want to tell her anything. But we ignored that and. Then they left my mom and my dad went to go visit my grandmother down the street, so that was that was sort of avoided, but this morning. My mom was going to go into my daughter's the baby's room. because she heard him up and my niece GG goes no no don't go in there, why didn't you go watch mass right. she's what she does in the morning, and so, when I got up to my mom was like I know something's going on i'm like Okay, I have to tell you, because no one else has the guts to tell you there's a new puppy in a house and she didn't screen, which is what everyone expected her do."
148.0,Provider,mm hmm.
12557.0,Patient,"He just said, I don't want any dogs. I don't know if your dad's ready for that, but even if he was I don't want any dogs were getting too old this this map, then I agree they're in their 60s, you know, like early 60s. And I was just like whoa i'm here to tell you I didn't bring the dog I told my brother, it would be too early, and now I have to now, I have to do with it nice now i'm the dog he's like mom and i'm like he's six weeks old, I have no clue how to take care of a six week. buffy but also he's incredibly adorable. And so, everyone is like. Helping. my daughter, the kids my son in law they're all like super excited you know, but my mom and my father are not so I don't know what's going to happen, but. It doesn't stress me out I think it's quite funny at this point."
148.0,Provider,Okay.
12557.0,Patient,"What does stress me out, though, is my dad and how he's going to cope, or like process this stuff because, like I said he really does keep things in and. I don't know I worry about my parents, a lot yeah."
148.0,Provider,yeah.
12557.0,Patient,yeah so.
148.0,Provider,This isn't a situation that's stressing you out you're not feeling overwhelmed by the puppy. you're finding a little amusing actually.
12557.0,Patient,"I am. I am, which is really rare for me cuz. i'm surprised when my when my brother came in with the dog I was just like. Normally I would be like you're out of your mind, but I was like you know what you brought the dog you deal with it, but of course they don't deal with because they they always think things up to me, you know. You talk with either you talk with Bobby he'll get over it, you just take care of the dog. Oh that's Nice, you know that's a big responsibility six weeks old, but I see how happy the kids are and and the truth is, I can't help it like you know snuggle with him, all that is is. Completely adorable. i'm trying to get my dad to name him so he feel some sort of like responsibility or ownership over this, but he's like no. And when he leaves he's like make sure to take care of your new baby i'm like. yeah. All right."
148.0,Provider,yeah.
12557.0,Patient,"I would yeah but, but I do worry about my father, not so much that he and I feel like in a couple months, he might get over that you know, but that he really he really sort of that time to do when I tell you that they lonnie like was his baby. Oh, did I tell you this like my father stopped cooking meat for us when I was like a team right or something like that. And he said you guys are old enough cook your meat I don't want to touch that stuff anymore, but when I came along, he was like cooking him the best kind of me, you know. Was she she had a good life and a lot of that had to do with like how much my dad took care of her yeah. yeah yeah."
148.0,Provider,"And how attached, you can get to your pet."
12557.0,Patient,"yeah I like I I caught myself crying and group, and I was like what the hell I knew, she was I knew, she was sick I knew, she was saying she's not in pain anymore, you know and. But I was like wow i'm crying that's fear i'm crying about it that's weird because my grandmother always had pets. And when I was little I did cry by them when the past, you know but. I don't know there's always like some sort of ceremony. So it felt felt better yeah. yeah yeah and it didn't stick with me. it's."
148.0,Provider,Time to process and grieve also.
12557.0,Patient,"yeah, I guess, I guess, so I didn't I didn't think I would because I felt like I knew it was coming it's like you know that someone sick and you know that this day is coming. But then you're like playing and talking to them in the morning and in the afternoon, and then by 8pm they're not moving anymore it's like what we're just we're just happened to my grandson was like. At some point he felt really overwhelmed because um. You put them in his little casket my dad started to dig the grave. At some point, my father could not keep digging the green, and so we have people that work on her backyard and they happen to be in the neighborhood. So he called them ask them to come help him and I was like Oh, he can't even dig that grave right now, like that's but he won't say anything right. And then I think. When we were about to put him in the ground. I think I spoke to my my father's like he's Buddhist so he put his prayer beads in there and then often run into my I have a small collection of rosaries he came in here. about what am I rosaries and when you put it in the casket and then put them in the ground, and you know put flowers and everything on top. And then, when we were walking back to to bed my grass and just started like seriously crying yeah he had a hard time going back to sleep, of course. And then, in the morning, his first question was like what do you think the money's going to reincarnate as I was, like either I don't I don't know if she going back as a dog she's coming back as something else is she coming back human like like I don't know. I didn't know what to say to him, but. he's been asking about a lot. Even before the honey, I think it's because yeah. So there's always that conversation. it's also my my both my grandparents paternal grandparents there. they're passing anniversary in October and that's by October is really hard for me, you know. So there's that too. But i'm not as stressed as not yet right as I usually am or as anxious as I usually am about stuff coming you know. So i'm going to take that as a good sign, be grateful about that."
148.0,Provider,"yeah and just living, one day, at a time being mindful yeah. practicing that gratitude absolutely is they're all really helpful tools um. How are you sleeping and eating."
12557.0,Patient,"me okay I sleep better now that i'm taking three things at night, so I don't fall asleep when I wish I could fall asleep, but I stay asleep longer, which you know. I just need to sleep more hours and maybe take the medicine earlier than I think I needed. Okay yeah."
148.0,Provider,yeah so.
12557.0,Patient,i'll be experimenting with that.
148.0,Provider,yeah so you're still finding those right adjustments that you need to make TIM yeah.
12557.0,Patient,"yeah and I think it's really just more timing. And I have gained a lot of weight for me. And I know that had to do with like the pandemic and not moving around as much and not being motivated to like exercise in the House because i'm like that's not really exercise like i'd rather go out like walking or hiking I can't run anymore, because you know, I have a messed up ankle. So I don't know, and I know i'm not a person that really cares about wait I just I just feel tired, you know."
148.0,Provider,"yeah makes sense yeah and just going back to what you just said you're not alone in that right. it's definitely been hard during a pandemic, to find that motivation and continue in your routine that you're literally just taken out of right. yeah um So is there anything that you want to incorporate like any goals into you know starting a workout routine, even if it's just getting out for a walk a couple times a week."
12557.0,Patient,"um yeah. Well, I feel like now that I have a little doggy and the kids that love him already that i'll probably be able to take more like walks or go to the park and walk with my grandkids and and the puppy. You haven't named me it. Everyone has a different name for actually already, which is how we work until one sticks. But. I mean I am moving more here at home, because I feel like i'm always just cleaning. I feel like i'm in constant moving. If it's you know, like organizing drawers organizing the kitchen, which is a constant job because there's it's a full House you know I mean mopping sweeping gardening when my mom was out so that all her flowers are still pristine because that's what. She does. Now yeah. that's her therapy. Going walking into my grandma's house and helping her because she was when everyone went on vacation was really just my grandmother, and one of my uncles and his schedule change so we were all taking turns to go look after her. You know. She really should just be laying down watching TV right when people should be started in her and so that's what we'll try to do. And she you know she's up there in age, so my my grandmother has it has always had like a green thumb you know she's grown everything fruits. Vegetables, Flowers people might like my whole life my mom is the same way, my dad is the same way, my aunt is the same way, my uncle's though really going to shit you know not not along those lines. So you know i've been doing that for my grandmother also so I feel like i'm getting a little more active and i'm still like really just sort of. My energy is still really low it's like I just do things slowly better i'm trying to keep moving. Okay, good."
148.0,Provider,um do you feel like you're less stressed when you're living at home versus when you're living with your fiance.
12557.0,Patient,yeah. huh yeah.
148.0,Provider,"And how is that been being at home, has been with him."
12557.0,Patient,"Oh it's good like he totally understands it's not like. mean I think my dad thinks that his apartment is my apartment and i'm like no dad I live here. But I do when I do go to his place, I do say for some days or like a week or so. But. And the only thing that yeah it does stress me out when i'm with them, because I feel like he's always stressed out about something, and when he gets stressed out he doesn't. He doesn't communicate very well and I always have to ask, did you take your medication, did you do this, you that how much how much how many cups of coffee, did you have you know, like he already he has like really jumping energy, you know so he is on medication for that. So yeah there is there is that. But also the last month now it's not more his friend is visiting. And he was helping him with jobs and whatnot and his friend is also just like not in a very good place you know. He hasn't come off as depressed but he is like he's like reevaluating like his life and why things aren't going how he would like it to the pandemic also through him fairly because."
148.0,Provider,yeah.
12557.0,Patient,"he's yeah he's like an audio like technician and teacher and and so all those jobs are kind of just shrinking and Florida he didn't have like the income that he was making are the connections that he used to have everyone is sort of like displaced and roaming around. So. Jim Saima tickets I just come over here, but he said i'm a one way ticket and he said, you can stay here, as long as you want I help you with like looking for jobs and working in your resume and Jim is really good about that. And pretty professional about that, because he always had like a contract job so he was putting resumes out all the time, you know. But and then about two weeks ago, his lady friend came to visit and they had a couple of really bad episode, so I was just like yeah i'm i'm I don't want to walk into something that like heightens my."
148.0,Provider,"own anxiety, when you say episodes what type."
12557.0,Patient,"I mean coordinate like like. I think eventually around alcohol yeah. Okay, and and. I don't think he has ever been a really heavy alcohol drinker like there's. You know this year, there was moments where you're celebrating something and people get like drunk right but it wasn't like it's something that he did he's, on the other end right he's he smokes as we used to just chill out, and so you know. Where it gets like. obsess over some machine or or B or something right so it's not like a violent thing or anything like that, but. He went to like Santa Cruz with Melissa is his friend right and they had a big like fight, and she went and got like. her own hotel room but didn't tell anyone so after like 24 hours everyone's like where the where is she you know she's not answering her calls or so he calls her family to be like I can't find Melissa we got into an argument. she's not here. And then, Jim got Ahold of her and she was like you know I just had to put myself to sleep, we got into an argument I didn't want to deal with it. And, but she was super pissed that he called her family, all this stuff and I was just like yeah you know I really feel for you guys, but I just in in my head that i'm like I can't i'm not going to deal with this right now. And then she left actually she left yesterday just 24 hours after they had another really bad argument in jim's house and he threatened to kill himself. And he wasn't drunk they weren't drunk they weren't drinking so that's i'm like I told you that he was, but you know I told jamison like it's. He can't do. Much to help them if GABE doesn't want help you know. But I I knew that. It was just a while for him to just going to take a minute for him to like really lose it because I feel like he also holds stuff in you know. An eight you know what. When you have those characteristics, you can see those characteristics and people right. So I don't know that was all bad and I was like oh no I hate that Jim is in the middle of that because it's his home. Jim told me he told him straight up listen if you're going to pull us down like this i'm buying you a ticket home, you can leave right now and. Melissa said i'm i'm leaving i'm going to a hotel close to the airport and the morning after i'm hopping like back on a flight to New York and that's exactly what she did."
148.0,Provider,You know just a friend and Melissa that had gotten into a fight.
12557.0,Patient,"it's gave which is jen's like really good friend. and Melissa is games. Well, I think there I think they love each other that's my opinion that but Dave is not in a good place right."
148.0,Provider,"I gotcha. yeah and so um it's just in the middle of all of this, I gotcha."
12557.0,Patient,"yeah yeah he's like he was the one after that communicating with the other one they're all in a small college right one bedroom one office it's like this is i'm glad i'm not there right now. um, but I also I feel a lot of empathy for both gave and Melissa because I feel like Jim and I have been there before you know, like our relationship was not good in the beginning. And that was because of not my drinking I didn't I feel like I didn't drink like that. For like I was or I have been recently right, it was he just. He was an out of control drunk and an angry one and. I was like I don't even want to be your friend I don't. i'm the one I am the one after like a really bad episode. I just I didn't know what to do, I call the COPs on him a couple times a culture like you're in a hotel room and he'll take it off, I was like what kind of God sorry right. I just i'm like you need to take him out of here he's not okay he's gonna hurt himself or hurt me and but then I was scared to leave him alone because I thought he really was going to hurt himself, you know. And then, at some point I just couldn't take it, and this is before i've i've never had an iPhone until. Jim got me one for my birthday, and I was like, why did you get me this perfectly fine with like a flip phone. But I figured out how to use it, I called. His and have. tons of close friends here, you know he's from the east coast right, but he does have a core group that are also from the east coast over here, so I looked for a couple of names I sounded familiar to me, because this is like really in the beginning, and we weren't boyfriend and girlfriend. To me, he was just like a Fuck buddy and we would go out and you know, whatever I wasn't looking for anything and. I was like this is too much for me we're just supposed to like have fun and go go our way you know. So I did find the number of this woman amber who's friends with them, he was also a substance abuse counselor and I remember to that because we talked about that with, but because I was in social work, and so I have friends to do a little bit of everything, so we can talk about that. yeah and. I called her and I told her exactly what what was happening in that I was sorry to call her like at this time with this news, but that I didn't know what to do, and she straight went into like her counseling mode and. She talked him down a little bit and. I called an ambulance the ambulance took into like the er. And she and she told him you're gonna lose a lot if you don't like put yourself into rehab and so she got him a space and rehab. over here. It was going to be a couple of days. By then, I had talked to another friend of his oh no he called him, and this is this guy I I do love he's an amazing like person, and I know that they they love each other, like so much right. So hakeem called me, I guess, he found my number in jim's phone and he said he said his gym there with you i'm like no What do you mean wasn't he going to rehab and he was like I came home after work and he's not here his phone is here, and this stuff is here and I can't find them anywhere. So he basically crawl to like every bar and neighborhood and found a gym yeah he found Jim fluffed up you know. And and but he was like you need to detox all night you're not going out I don't care if I have to like tie you down you're going to rehab. Tomorrow, and that's what happened, and he was away for a month and I just said, you know how can you I don't I don't want to talk to him, like I just. I just I just I don't know I felt defeated and I felt like what's he going to do, like what is he thinking like you know so that that was really like the beginning of our more serious relationship. While he was in rehab he he sent me a letter all the time, you know, like apologizing and whatnot and. And he would like send flowers to the House and, like kind of turn on rehab like I would get like really upset, but when he came back was like oh you're a completely different person, you know, and he worked on himself did a pretty much every day. yeah yeah yeah and he stuck to it for about a year and a half or so to had a small relapse or my dad stepped in and by then we were we were serious right. yeah yeah so my relationship with Jim has always been like great I don't think he's ever totally apologize for any of that stuff because he he's like I don't remember i'm like is that the point is that is that really the point so. So I got I just went off i'm sorry."
148.0,Provider,Okay.
12557.0,Patient,"So I do feel for like GABE and Melissa because i'm like oh i've been there and it sucks yeah right so. yeah. But Jim says that gave is doing a little bit better Jen seems to be doing better. Because I know that he was stressed out about that and stressed out about whether or not to take. This permanent position and another company. he's taking he's taking a pay cut. But it's permanent and he's like i'm just going to do this for as long as I can until I find like no perfect permanent job and so he was doing contract work with Facebook and that's sort of that's the company he wants to stay with. and luckily, he has. or his his manager from Facebook and him really developed a good rapport and. He said he's gonna as soon as something comes up that's permanent he's going to try that that fits gym and like his needs and he's going to to refer him in house and so. I don't know how long that's going to take your. You know I mean but. But he has people looking out for him. So he's I think that's the de stressor for him and he finally went to buffalo last weekend. yeah last weekend to see his mother who hasn't seen in a long time she's in assisted living with the pandemic there's just like you know it's not the smartest thing to do to walk into an Assisted Living home. So and she's about to be. 91 or 92. yeah so we're gonna go there for Christmas and I. I think i've only left my family for Christmas once before, and it was to go to my cousin's wedding in Florida, and I didn't leave until we celebrate like Christmas Eve right so. Christmas Day, we just sort of show, so my mom and I left on Christmas Day. And so that's what Jim and I are going to do celebrate with the family Christmas Eve, and then. We have Christmas Day so. i'm looking forward to that because I really love his mom i'm like this is an Oh, these are things that have worked up for that i'm just again i'm trying to like be grateful and calm about stuff is. I don't know how it's going to be for Jim when his mother passes, you know. At this point, there's no like. You know she doesn't have another 20 years. She may not have another 10. Right right. So. I think, Jim started worthy like getting fucked up drunk like blacked out duis stuff when his father passed away."
148.0,Provider,says they're a little bit of fear there that. He might want behaviors. yeah um.
12557.0,Patient,"yeah it really that does worry me i'm trying not to think like that, but um yeah. But I mean at some point and he's an only child Well he has a sister in England that he didn't know about until he was an adult. His father was in you know, the army. yeah yeah so. That happened and. her parents didn't let her come over here just Okay, because he married Cindy and then had gym right. But um and he has he has a relationship with his sister yeah but she's over there, and so, for him, that would be sort of like. It was always sort of him and his parents and. I think, with with his drinking he's uh. he's made amends with his family, but. Some of these families, just like whatever you know so. That there's they're sort of just like done with it, with him, for now, you know. yeah yeah. And I don't even I don't even think it's about the drinking it's a he he made a choice like. He and his mother made the choice together to sell the home. The family home and move her into like Assisted Living because she needed more help and she didn't feel like he could support her, and that on a buffalo income. And so, live, you know. himself, you know I mean so that's why he came over to the bay area because he was like, if I can make this money sport and mothers put myself and that's what i'm going to have to do. It but his his family wasn't really understanding of that so he has a handful of relatives who do get it, but. anyways yeah that does worry me, but again trying to just keep calm and Cindy surprises me, though, she's spunky as hell. She still she dressed to the nines every day right she is on her things and I call her groups in Assisted Living place. She she beat cancer for years ago. wow yeah yeah without chemo. Just unlike some medication, so I didn't know she may have a lot of life left in her, but I feel like I had to start prepping James and I know how to do that because. I don't know it's not he he's like my father and like dealing with I mean I don't think anyone deals with death like great like it's not a great thing to deal with right but it's a realistic thing to look at you know. Right yeah. Anyhow that's pretty much it. Oh, I did watch the the print a brown right."
148.0,Provider,Is that or no yeah What did you. Think of. Her talk.
12557.0,Patient,I actually I enjoyed it more than I thought that I would i'm not really into like that sort of like motivational stuff too much you know.
148.0,Provider,And that's okay.
12557.0,Patient,"yeah but um but I enjoyed it, it was very relatable. And the way she you know. talked about it, and so I think that made all the difference, I thought she was funny. I liked her comparisons of things so yeah I liked it I liked it enough that I sent him a text to tell him and gay to watch it."
148.0,Provider,I thought you enjoyed it.
12557.0,Patient,"yeah thanks for the recommendation, if you have any more."

You check out she has a lot of great books to huge fan of Bernie brown um but i'll think of some other things to recommend to you just kind of. Maybe or just around addiction and recovery in general. yeah how are you feeling about your recovery."
12557.0,Patient,"Right now, I feel Okay, when we went out to have lunch with my mom yesterday. You know. There was like a couple bottles of wine and a couple pictures of beer. And I looked at the beer and I was like. Oh, that looks good I didn't have a craving you know."
148.0,Provider,wow when did you start taking the antabuse.
12557.0,Patient,"Oh that's what it's called yeah I pick it up. Like four or five days ago, I think."
