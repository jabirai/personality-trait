ID,Role,Message
280.0,Patient,"morning, or maybe afternoon for you. I can't hold on can you hear me. OK, I can hear you just making sure my bluetooth was. operating correctly. Okay. Okay. Is that light behind me annoying."
105.0,Provider,"No. Based on the text I just saw it might be helpful to review this happens, I noticed with clients that don't see me on a weekly basis anymore. I think clients forget, and you may have forgotten that these are recorded and this they end after each, and so I will always hang up on you. yeah."
280.0,Patient,"I actually didn't know that but yeah I know that you say that that makes sense, so far yeah cool I didn't know, I was just like it just told me it kicked me out, so I just wanted to know what do I do."
105.0,Provider,"So just the instruction is just automatically show up again and, occasionally, all I do is close it and reopen."
280.0,Patient,Under said.
105.0,Provider,So. How you doing.
280.0,Patient,"i'm doing great doing great um why hold on i'm getting a phone call me. decline that and then i'm going to put it on do not disturb so give me one second. Okay, now that won't happen again. Anyway, i'm doing i'm doing great i'm really the only thing that is going on that's different is i'm still trying to adjust to my teeth. The bottom ones, have been a challenge to get comfortable I guess so i'm going back again tomorrow. And he did tell me, you know if we have to heal scrap the the one and just do a whole new bottom. Set you know, free of charge or whatever so so we'll work it out it's just kind of I can actually eat most things without just with my gums so on the bottom, I can chew most things that I need so. Not that big a deal, but like for cosmetic reasons, I guess, and so you know talking like I think. At least for me when i'm talking I can hear all the weird little things that i'm doing, and that makes me really self conscious, so it would be helpful to have you know I don't know teeth that fit a little better than aren't the cause me so much pain and discomfort. So that's that's the problem I mean they look fine, but they just I can't I can't even wear them just wear them and, like not eat or or do anything. So it's been a challenge, because the top ones I don't even notice them now like i'm so used to them they're just there and. They don't hurt me, you know, so I don't know anyway that's pretty much that's pretty much the only thing that's really been going on it's like different i've been working. taking care of the kids the kids my sister's kids Mondays and Tuesdays. same old same old."
105.0,Provider,"You said, your lower teeth are causing pain and discomfort."
280.0,Patient,yeah the denture because they pulled all the teeth out. yeah. And it's not yeah so they're just I don't know how to describe it they're very uncomfortable it's like I mean I don't know trying to there they're just very hard and I can tell it very hard and like they rub in certain spots like. immediately when I put them on so. that's been a challenge but.
105.0,Provider,Just your provider know they're causing pain and.
280.0,Patient,"Oh yeah yeah we've been working on it like it's we're trying to get it. To where it's supposed to be so I have, I have another appointment tomorrow. he's going to do some more stuff to it now that i've healed a little more from the. extractions. So honestly just just being out of pain from that from like the bad teeth that I had in my mouth it's it's worth it just that alone so. I was in so much pain and I was taking so much tylenol and ibuprofen. Because I was in so much pain all the time, so it's nice to not be doing that anymore."
105.0,Provider,I wasn't aware of that. we're aware that you were in pain all the time.
280.0,Patient,"yeah eddie knew about it, he's been on me this whole time to get to do something about it. But you know i'm. I don't know I had to get to that place with myself a lot of times like when I have to when i'm facing something big like a big change or something. I have to get to a place within myself where like. i'm kind of like disgusted enough with whatever the situation is that i'm ready to do whatever I have to do to change it. And that's just kind of like how i've always done it I don't know I mean that's how it was with my addiction that's how it was with my weight that's how it was with my teeth. that's how it was with both of my relationships with my two ex husband well more of my second one than my first one, but I mean that's just how i've always been with those like big life decisions and. And, and so, once I got you know just fed up basically I just get so fed up that i'm just like okay Fuck it i'll do anything to not feel this way anymore, or whatever it is so and then and then i'll do whatever it takes to change it, but it takes me a long time it took me like. I think two fucking years or something to to get to the point, with my teeth, that I was like Okay, like the fear was no longer outweighing the you know the the. The procedure. or whatever it was like before it was this uneven, you know. I had more fear and anxiety about going in and having the extractions done than I did about."
105.0,Provider,You know the idea of having.
280.0,Patient,"yeah the end the idea of having like nice teeth being able to smile being able to talk to people freely with my mouth open, you know. I wasn't thinking about those things I was just thinking about it's going to hurt it's going to suck they're gonna pull my teeth out, you know. Like I was just focusing on all the negative stuff for like two years and then I finally got fed up enough that it was just like okay i'll do anything and finally made the appointment. And because my best friend was here and eddie they both kind of like encouraged me to keep the appointment made sure I got there, and once the top ones were out, it was, like all right here we go we're gonna just do the whole thing because we're halfway there so. yeah I was in pain, I mean I had. I don't know how many teeth in my mouth that we're actively. Like rotting I mean they were just in such bad shape. And I mean I don't know if you've ever had a cavity that actually gets to the point where it hurts you but it's keeping is terrible it's probably i've never had children So for me that's like the worst pain, I can i've ever. experienced that I can think of, I mean the migraines are pretty up there, but. that's like a different kind of pain, so I don't know if the worst it was terrible but it wasn't it wasn't enough, like the fear and anxiety were worse than, then the pain was really for like a long time, I was just scared to go through with it."
105.0,Provider,I was aware of migraine pain and I hadn't heard about teeth heard about them it's interesting.
280.0,Patient,"Do you find it well, I kind of I kind of, and this isn't really about you, but. it's more about bright heart, I kind of. decided not to talk to them about pain, because. When I came back in August that was something that. I saw like a I don't remember her name but I saw. One of your guys's one of their pain doctors like I had an appointment. or whatever."
105.0,Provider,Maybe.
280.0,Patient,"Tracy gesture, yes, yes, yes, yes, that was her name. And I wanted to get back on. One of the medications that worked for my migraines for when I had them I didn't want to have like you know I don't know a lot on Hannah just wanted to have a little bit and. I told her you know which ones worked for me and she just kind of she really just skimmed over the whole thing and didn't do anything she. Did absolutely nothing she told me some neck exercises and like i've been dealing with migraines since I was 19 years old, I know about the fucking neck. Sorry i'm getting emotional, because it makes me so mad when people don't take me seriously. About migraines."
105.0,Provider,yeah.
280.0,Patient,"i've had like two doctors actually. Give a shit so after that happened with her, I just kind of decided that I wasn't going to. pursue any. pain management. conversations with anyone at breitbart. because she just didn't I mean she did absolutely nothing so. And it made me pretty angry actually but I mean i'm also like it was also like Oh, here we go again, you know i've had so many doctors like that so."
105.0,Provider,yeah.
280.0,Patient,"I felt like I just started having them. that's the thing you know it's not like this is a brand new problems it's something i've been I personally have been dealing with most of my life yeah. So you know she and she just kind of treated me like. I don't know like I was just getting my inner headaches. And it wasn't a big deal and I need to you know pay attention to my posture that's like what she kept talking about and only. it's not my posture like I do try to pay attention to my boss my posture it was my posture i'd have them all the time, I mean that just doesn't make any sense it's not my posture so."
105.0,Provider,So who. Are you able to right now have that position here and give you the medication that's bringing.
280.0,Patient,"I don't have one right now I actually just made an appointment i've been on the waiting. list with a clinic for almost two years because of coven and and like I got on it right before it started and then to have it so. I need to grab a tissue excuse me um. So the actually today I just made an appointment I would they were able to get me but I can't get in until November 30 that's their next, so I made the appointment. But November 30 is when i'll see somebody and I don't know. Excuse me, I don't know we'll see what happens. You know I go in there, expecting basically what happened with Dr Jackson or whoever, she is. That that's going to happen with everybody because that's usually what happens so usually it's just I get treated like i'm. I don't know if they think i'm like drug seeking or what but it's like it's it's not about that so i'm gonna it's frustrating. i'm not asking for oxy. or anything i'm asking. i'm not i'm asking for midrin and for your set and that's those are I mean. I know that the your site does have a I think it's a barbiturate in it, but it's a very little bit and I never abused that drug ever ever ever ever so it was and I told her that and she was just I mean it was like. Well i'm sure they have a recording of it, it was just kind of like I felt like she just didn't even address it at all, it was just she talked about. Things like diet and which you know yeah she's right about diet, but i'm again been doing this for years, I know my food triggers so I avoid those. You know so it's just. Another I expect the same thing to happen or something similar, hopefully it won't but."
105.0,Provider,that expectation.
280.0,Patient,yeah.
105.0,Provider,"How will you be with this new physician like, how will so we'll go with the expectation, how will that end up."
280.0,Patient,"effect impacting like how I how I act or how I. yeah um I mean it I don't think it does really because I still i'm just very straightforward and I just am factual and I just tell them, you know what i've experienced and what has worked for me. So, and you know and and you know, give them any information that they need if they need a doctor's name or whatever, unfortunately, the one doctor that. That really was like amazing and took me seriously passed away in 2007 or 2006 so she's been dead, a long time, and I have never found another doctor, like her, so. I mean, Dr Gabriel comes pretty close, but this doctor that I had did everything, so I could go to her, for you know everything and i've had like a pain in my leg and the lower the lower part of my left leg for a while now and. I don't know if I told her about that, but I told her also my back, which has been a problem for years, those are about that too, and like I said posture was just all she wanted to talk about so. neck exercises and. Like I know I don't I do those I do them when I need to I know about that, and she was, I think she told me about that. What is it the tennis ball thing, where you like push up against the wall like what the tennis ball you try to like roll back up yeah, and I mean I know about all that stuff too, so it just it was just like. A review of. Things I already knew and like no help offered so I started answering like in my surveys and stuff I started answering like I don't have any pain. what's the point so. What."
105.0,Provider,does make me sad. That. You had to not be your full truth. Because. It just does.
280.0,Patient,yeah.
105.0,Provider,Are you someone who does the things you've learned let's say.
280.0,Patient,"he's most of the time, even if it works for me okay i'm somebody who. will at least try it once. Then, if I get good results, yes."
105.0,Provider,Okay.
280.0,Patient,"I mean that's why I do the the square breathing and I didn't know that's not something like I obviously didn't come up with it on my own I didn't figure it out, on my own, I was told about it, Sarah my old therapist. You know, told me about it so um and it works great for me, so I do it um so yeah I mean. If it works i'm definitely down to try it once and see what the results are."
105.0,Provider,All right. um. I don't happen to know this is just sort of content driven. But I don't happen to know. If Dr Gabriel has prescribed the fear set or not. But it does sound like you're have following through with your November 30 appointments a great idea.
280.0,Patient,"yeah. I mean, I need to be seen for i'm just need like a general physical I can't remember the last time I had one so that's what you know I need a. You know or not I don't want to say real doctor or PCP I need a primary care doctor is what I need. So somebody that can you know send me off for all the lab words that I need, and you know all that stuff and. It seems like Dr April has a very full plate, and I don't know she even does stuff like that I know."
105.0,Provider,So. it's better to go to primary care. you're going to.
280.0,Patient,throw yeah yeah.
105.0,Provider,From what i've i've watched.
280.0,Patient,"And i've never asked well actually I think I did have a conversation with audrey real about the fewer steps before and that's when she was like well you know let's get you in with Dr Jackson or whatever. I see, so I don't know if that's just because she wanted, you know me to have like a pain, I had to do all these surveys and, and all this stuff before I could meet with her, so I don't know if she wanted me to just like have that full profile. And then meet with a pain specialist or she just wasn't comfortable with you know work with prescribing me back I don't know what it was, but I think it was the first thing, rather than the the latter but um. But I don't know so I never brought it up with her again after that because, like I said I just I just decided not to. Excuse me bother with a great heart and pain. Issues."
105.0,Provider,"Not knowing a label for that just going with the story you shared. Do you see that elsewhere, whatever this label we don't have one, but do you see doing that anywhere else."
280.0,Patient,"Like where I just shut down and don't talk about anymore on. I mean, I did in the past, like with other in other relationships. And like with my ex husband I wouldn't ever tell him. How I was feeling and stuff because. It usually causes fight so I just kind of didn't talk very much in that relationship honestly. But I don't think so now, I mean. I guess, I guess, I kind of get to that point with my employers, sometimes it depends on you know I have in the past, because on what's going on, so. But. I think, right now, the only thing that i'm experiencing that with is this painting with bright heart and trying to find a doctor. That takes me seriously."
105.0,Provider,"How have you been managing these months, and I think you may have said years."
280.0,Patient,But what. What your.
105.0,Provider,"Oh, forget the years don't get too distracted with the time frame how have you been managing."
280.0,Patient,Managing what like the pain.
105.0,Provider,uh huh.
280.0,Patient,"Oh well, I mean I used i'm provenance tylenol and basically the dentist dentist I had years ago told me that I could. alternate tylenol and ibuprofen and basically have the same pain management that I would get from like a vitamin or something and it's it's true it works on. You take every two hours, so you end up taking you know i'm profaned every four or you can do it every three if you want to take them every six hours, whatever. But you end up taking it every six hours because it's like on your profile and then you take tylenol and then the next time you take it. So it's every six hours for the other person every six hours but that's pretty much no I didn't do that all the time it's not like I was the whole time for the last two years. Every day, taking well most days most days I was taking ibuprofen or tylenol."
105.0,Provider,and
280.0,Patient,And like ice packs occasionally on salt water rinses definitely want if you've got really bad.
105.0,Provider,and your migraines how are you managing those.
280.0,Patient,"same as a person mm hmm. It doesn't really work usually have to go and lay down in a dark room like a cold Pack on my head. and I mean, thankfully, I don't really have the ones like knock me out for days anymore, but I still get bad ones that take me out for an evening you know i'm i'm down i'm sleeping sleeping i'm laying in my bed with my eyes closed. For the evening so and they especially happened around my period so obviously there are some of that hormonal. But anyway, I can be proven. That."
105.0,Provider,When you get a moment Would you mind putting the device.
280.0,Patient,Just that on the surface. There you go.
105.0,Provider,"i'm looking as we meet in frequently so we're due for a little review. And one of your goals is wanting to improve nutrition. that's right, who is a nutritionist so your best friend as a nutritionist. client will meet with sister to create meal plans is that objective still relevant for you."
280.0,Patient,"Because I can change, I mean i'm doing it. i'm doing it, so I don't know it's not really a goal anymore, I guess it's something i'm doing so I don't know how you want to spill coffee oh. I don't know how you want to note that, but yeah i'm doing it so."
105.0,Provider,"So I will right, I am doing what."
280.0,Patient,um I don't know meal planning with dre i've been doing it with dre really my sister. And like grocery shopping and according to the meal plan and. You know that's like trying to have a vegetable some kind of vegetable with every meal or whatever other salad or something we cook.
105.0,Provider,What did you learn about.
280.0,Patient,"Nutrition okay. Well, instead of buying fast food sorry what."
105.0,Provider,Did you learn from your friend.
280.0,Patient,"I mean, just like about me I already thought of stuff I kind of knew, but just don't do more did it do like looking at the nutrition labels and stuff and like seeing you know how much. Sugar and how much. fats and stuff like that is in in calories. And stuff like that, and then. I don't know just. Just it's mainly it's just been like eating at home instead of eating out. So that's like been the biggest thing and also like vegetables, because we haven't been eating out when I cook I always make a vegetable with us as a side so. Since we haven't been eating out we've been eating more vegetables. I mean I haven't really changed like much about the foods, I cook. I still cook them the same way and use the same ingredients and stuff but. And I still. eat like small portions. I eat. I mean, I even time full but I don't like when I don't know before, when I was overweight, I would like load my plate, you know. And then feel like I had to eat it all, because I put it on my plate and that's kind of how I was raised, if it's on your plate, you have to eat it. So something that I learned like as an adult when I was initially losing weight was to serve myself smaller portions and you know try, you know, try to be like really conscious about how much i'm putting on my plate aware of it, mindful that was the word I was looking for mindful so. Practice, a lot of mindfulness when i'm eating or prepping to eat."
105.0,Provider,I put achieved on that one so ask about it next month just put it down here on achieved closed schools and other one is I. want to be more active. client will increase walking from zero to three times a week Where are you at with that.
280.0,Patient,i'd say two to three times a week. Let dre and I will take a walk around our neighborhood or will sometimes we'll take the kids to the park and run around with them and then not take a walk that day because we ran around with the kids for 30 minutes so like chasing them around and running actually we're running.
105.0,Provider,"That seal or do you think that that meets the goal, I want to be more active doesn't meet the goal that you set."
280.0,Patient,"yeah definitely um I think the only thing that I would like to do differently, is when i'm at work. I can't really do anything because I can't leave, so I can't take a walk. So i'm kind of like I don't know what to do so at work, I would like to try to I don't know that could be a new goal try to come up with something some way to. exercise for 20 or 30 minutes a day at work, because I do sit on my butt a lot over there, because i'm just you know there to help her out so. I end up studying a lot. I mean, I do get I have my my apple watch and if it bumps me once an hour and tells me to get up and I most of the time pay attention to it get up and walk around and. So I don't just like sit there for hours, but like I said a lot at work, so I would like to. Do whether it's like you know the or I don't know, maybe some light weight. Like hand weights, or something. That I can just take with me and you know do for 20 or 30 minutes, we also got an exercise bike. At here at the House so i'm going to start working that in to. Like alternating that with the locks or whatever, maybe one day doing this building and then then stay doing a walk. We just got it last week so. When I was a kid we had one of these stationary bikes and it was so not like this is big old giant thing."
105.0,Provider,yeah contact.
280.0,Patient,"yeah it's like it's pretty small it only has the one wheel so there's no wheel in the bank I think there's a little wheel inside for the pedals but. yeah. turn it back around. Okay, go set it back down sorry."
105.0,Provider,Have you experimented with yoga in person.
280.0,Patient,"And what do you mean in person like in a yoga class or something. i'm not like an official hold on we think about that. No, not like in an official yoga class i've had a friend, a couple of friends teach me some stuff like we had a yoga session at my house. But it's been years. So that was a long time ago, I have a yoga mat. And I have actually have a big need somewhere I don't know where it's in a box somewhere. that's like beginning yoga moves or whatever. So I need to find that DVD i'm not sure where it is, I know I can also just look on YouTube I mean i'm so i'm not hung up on the DVD so I just know I have my my friend Rachel who's like a yoga a yogi I don't know when you purchase a yoga teacher. Like she went to school for it, or whatever. she gave me that even be."
105.0,Provider,"Thinking now that you've had this information available to you, what do you think has prevented you from already experimenting with it."
280.0,Patient,"This laziness I think just and also like I get. I do my diamond painting over there, I take it, with me and so that i'll get hung up on that for hours like i'll spend a whole day. Working on that so i'm almost halfway more than halfway done actually with that. Huge one I showed you guys a couple weeks ago. So I spent a lot of time on that."
105.0,Provider,let's look at motivation and what would be motivating you to do yoga. You know your reasons for it.
280.0,Patient,"i'm not sure what my reasons, are you know I don't want to just be like a lump on a log at work. I think it would be beneficial to my my health and my mood and stuff to. You know, do 20 or 30 minutes of something. A day when i'm there and I have like hours in the morning to myself, she doesn't get up until like 1130 or 12 so you know, and I get up at like eight, so I have you know four hours in the morning. I just will take advantage of that but I can't leave. So that's the thing like I can't I want to take a walk but. I can't so."
105.0,Provider,"and Have you done things that support this, for example, created a special space in the House already had the mat picked out close everything was ready for it, if you already pushed it so you were completely prepared."
280.0,Patient,"To have it, no, no, I mean I know where my mat is, and I know what clothes, I would. Take and I know where I would do it, but no I don't have all that stuff all setup or set out or whatever, no."
105.0,Provider,"And you have another goal, which is, I want to quit smoking it did remind me as you were sharing about I wait till I get fed up and discussed enough."
280.0,Patient,mm hmm.
105.0,Provider,And it made me think about that.
280.0,Patient,"has now, it makes me think about that too."
105.0,Provider,"I was showing someone, the other day, those lungs, the difference between what they look like, do you ever force yourself to do that, to try and get the reality of what you're doing yourself."
280.0,Patient,"I mean i've seen it before i've definitely seen it i'm dragon I went to a they had like an exhibit called the body and that was like traveling around the united. was like actual. yeah actual cadavers and stuff and they had. Smokers lungs they had smokers hearts. And I mean it was, like you, but I don't know sometimes i'm like what's wrong with me because I don't have that. I think, for some people when they see stuff like that it's enough to like make them go oh my God, I have to quit smoking, or whatever they're doing, I have to quit drinking because they saw like a liver with cirrhosis or whatever. But it's just never had much of an that's never had an impact on me if i'm being honest when I was a child, and I was like 13 we had. A guy come talk to us at our middle school or actually it might have been high school whatever that's irrelevant um I came and talked to us, and he had one of those. Thank you, oh yeah but like where you have to like. Air through it, or whatever, and you talk through it. That had no effect on me, I went right out after that and smoke a cigarette it's just my grandmother died from emphysema no effect on me, I still picked up a cigarette and smoke my first cigarette and kept smoking. So yeah I don't sometimes I really wonder like what the hell is wrong with me why doesn't that have like a. feeling that should have an effect on me those things that I just listed, but they don't like. I don't know why. But that's just how it's always been. Why, I don't know why you think that is I don't know why I feel like I should be reacting to something it doesn't. Have like a lasting impact on me at all."
105.0,Provider,"And what if it's just. The brain. Not the mind what if it's just the brain that just looks at short term pleasure, because brain doesn't like to look at loss what it's going to lose out on it doesn't like to do that in addiction, we just call it denial, you know we've got these little. right words we use, but they don't capture. Really, how intense, this is it has a massive impact. and It I wonder if it if it shares some commonality with what exercising you know the saga smoking doing things for gut health, you know really inconvenient now. But have long term gain. They share out here, they look like they share something in common it's postponing gratification immediate gratification."
280.0,Patient,mm hmm. I have always been very much a fan of immediate gratification.
105.0,Provider,"So true with with the marshmallow test, you would have been the little girl that would say."
280.0,Patient,"Oh God. i've been all gone and if there was a child in there, that was being good I probably would have taken hers to. Know that's no. And I probably do the same thing i'd probably do the same thing today one. i'm very impulsive I mean i'm very impulsive that's that is a fact. about me for sure."
105.0,Provider,"And I think what can be useful about this. Is the relationship between brain and we're just going to say that that's brain, which it is. But we'll leave. geology aside, but that is brain. And if we if we think well. I want to be smarter, I want to life. that's more evolved than just this old brain, I want to be more evolved and so now we can introduce this idea of mind, mind you, you use it, you know mindfulness and you know. consciousness and you. Know thought stopping you know how to use it as a technique."
280.0,Patient,You know.
105.0,Provider,"If you could think. I want to I don't know what the switch will be for you, but. i'm not sure there's time to wait, you know we wait till discussions."
280.0,Patient,This week I know. Yours happening so I know.
105.0,Provider,i'm throwing out yeah. yeah.
280.0,Patient,No i'm I know that that's not going to work for this.
105.0,Provider,"So if there is an interest to look at I don't want to be that. I don't want to be subject to just. The way the brain has been set up to spray this dough for me, I would like to be in charge and control and control and directive, I would like it. And if there was an openness enough to the idea that something you really don't know for sure might happen, an open mindedness just open to what if. This really structured way, maybe you got it from here, I know, never know when people have been in. My in my groups, the habit stalking. I don't know where you've been but. It and you went kicking and screaming you know, do you have a strong personality, when this is going to frickin suck no it's gonna suck it's not gonna work you. had all that that's fine, but you did it anyway, you put the clothes that were prepared, they have the mattress by the door, you had an alarm set on your phone in fact you were in the clothes. You did all of the setup that was there. And you did it, no matter what there was no wiggle out of it it's a commitment, you made a commitment to yourself, and you did the yoga. And you said nothing's going to get in this way between you and I, if a building was on fire, but I kind of like to say, because I don't like to be ridiculous, but really when you think about it, when you make any commitment to anyone. I will show up to work on these days."
280.0,Patient,mm hmm.
105.0,Provider,"Well, how dare you make that commitment it's the same thing, I will show up, and so you say to yourself, I will do yoga the same way, you make a commitment to show up to work and no, no more intellectualizing none of the rush just. I am capable of. And i'm going to do it and i'll go. Okay fucking going to hate it, and this is not going to fucking work, and you can do whatever you want right whatever."
280.0,Patient,yeah.
105.0,Provider,"you're doing it because you want to have the mind be directing and stead of that old reptilian brain you want it, you want more than that you want to. Be this other type of person."
280.0,Patient,You know.
105.0,Provider,"History, you can do it, I you and I lightly touch in on sugar, with candy here and there, and then we don't but. Anyway, sticky with this one. I want to check in if were you there in the group, where I went over the habit stalking some of the."
280.0,Patient,Little I have no. I have nothing about it. So I was definitely there okay.
105.0,Provider,If you became someone who did yoga.
280.0,Patient,mm hmm.
105.0,Provider,What would you like about being a person that occasionally a few times a week does yoga.
280.0,Patient,"Well, the people that I know that do yoga seem a little more centered i'm a little more peaceful. i'm. Flexible we're flexible. So. They have less excuse me less like. muscle pain and I think it, I mean the thing that I would really look forward to is hopefully would help my bag. So somebody with less back. Because that really I mean, I just have this spot in my bag is just three years and I don't know. I think that's probably from being a. person who was always on her feet at work, I mean for years and years for like 20 years I was a either a manager at a restaurant or I worked at a bank, I never sat down, I was always on my feet so and they think that's probably where the back problems come from, but I don't know I mean. I just know what hurts so something without you know, to have less pain and be more flexible and just generally that's what it seems like they have more peace."
105.0,Provider,He centered.
280.0,Patient,And they're more centered yeah.
105.0,Provider,And then you would have the the benefits of possible back pain relief and maybe something. yeah okay. You said also like just feeling like I you know I set a goal and I actually did it.
280.0,Patient,"Just that would be nice, you know that, because in the past, I mean i've always had a problem with that you know I set a goal right, I say i'm going to do something and then. I just don't I just procrastinate until it's too late or whatever I just don't do it, I never get it done and but like. I rarely finished what I set out to do, but when I went to rehab and I decided i'm going to finish this like, no matter what if, if I have to like. Go myself a year out i'm going to finish this and i'm going to graduate, no matter what, and I did, and like when I was done, it was such a huge like. accomplishment and it felt so great to have like set that goal and stuck to it and actually followed through and finished it and achieved it, so I think that you know would be also a good thing to focus on because. it's been helpful in the past. Like if it's the biggest thing I want to change."
105.0,Provider,"What if it's not a big thing, what if, instead, this little and it's just 120 minute video and you pick a time and no matter what you do it."
280.0,Patient,"it's now I guess i'm looking at it as a big thing but you're right, I mean it's just 20 minutes of my day here a."
105.0,Provider,horrible thing but.
280.0,Patient,Something like this huge change.
105.0,Provider,"I know, and so that's why I."
280.0,Patient,Think part of the problem.
105.0,Provider,"yeah yes. So what it is, what if he just said, instead, that that might be the troublemaker. If it's just I will do this for a five minute video I will get everything together, and I will make sure that this happens and you tell people you're going to do it, you say i'm even going to send you a little video of me doing it in the House and you set it up, I know that sounds strange."
280.0,Patient,"But no i'm i'm laughing because I totally have a friend, that I could do that with oh."
105.0,Provider,"We do it we don't have an actual parent anymore So these are things. We to hold ourselves accountable because. You aren't doing that for you. Right right doing it for you was smoking I don't know other things with other things going on. But typically right it's our external locus of control executive functioning that teaches us and then, finally, that comes on board. And there's been some stuff with. marijuana use and some of your history that i'm a little. fuzzy on not really sure we're all lands. So we can build that part of the brain but it's going to be inconvenient, but it will be inconvenient a little bit no more so than getting up. figuring out what's in the kitchen getting with the shopping list is getting your tush all the way to the store getting it preparing the meal, in fact, I think it will be easier. easier, you see it."
280.0,Patient,you're doing yeah yeah.
105.0,Provider,"you're doing what it takes to keep a commitment, yes, I will cook a meal no we don't need to bring anything home that's a commitment. You are doing it."
280.0,Patient,yeah i'm also keeping a clean house. I mean i've made some i've made some good changes so.
105.0,Provider,same skills.
280.0,Patient,So yeah okay.
105.0,Provider,"it's the same skills we're not we're not drawing from anywhere else, these are the things she know how to do. But one of the reasons why I asked you the question didn't quite get answered. You kind of answered not quite. i'm asking me again Okay, if you didn't do anything wrong. If you're a yoga. Doing person three times a week, what would you think of you."
280.0,Patient,Know honestly I don't I don't know I mean I i'd be.
105.0,Provider,"Just be present picturing yourself doing it three days a week, what would you think of you just picture yourself, making sure all the steps that are involved and doing it, and someone asking you just Nice and slow don't have to answer just take this in hey Oh, I do yoga hey Jen do you. Like that I do like what does that feel like. Just as I was doing a role play with. me think your response might be to me if I said hey oh I go to yoga on, but it does say days hey do you do yoga."
280.0,Patient,"I just started like I just started doing yoga and I love it that's probably probably see something like that, because I do think, I would like it i've liked it when i've tried it before. I mean it would definitely give me something else to talk to you know another subject to talk about and research and learn more about so that's always fun."
105.0,Provider,"let's see if this conversation leads you anywhere you, hopefully, you heard yourself say I know foo."
280.0,Patient,And you were there for.
105.0,Provider,"stalking which means we're going to need reminders alarm, making it easy which everything's already by the door you set up a reinforcement something like I can't have my coffee till i'm in my clothes are there it's in the car. set up a. An inner parent reinforcer where your setup contingency."
280.0,Patient,Okay.
105.0,Provider,"And that may bring up feelings for you and what those are and you could bring them back in here, he could message me email me but make note of them, if you will, because they might be the troublemakers. OK. OK let's go. out into. November so sometime between November 1 or November 5. let's go back to I think a Wednesday."
