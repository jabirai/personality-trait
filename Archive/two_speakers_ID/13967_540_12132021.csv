540.0,Provider,"No it's okay it's okay so really for this um what I just need to really do with you is just get your background and figure out kind of what brought you here. What do you work on while you're here so in counseling and. Just in general and then make some goals up for you individually. Okay, all right so tell me a little bit about your background and like what brought you to bright heart."
13967.0,Patient,um how far in my background we go.
540.0,Provider,"So, really, I mean I mean you a lot of people what they'll do is they'll kind of bring up like. Really, the things that have led to like. them coming here so whether or not it's been like family dynamic growing up, and since that have happened that kind of transpired so are you here for mental health, are you here for substance abuse what's like your primary."
13967.0,Patient,"Oh i'm under i'm here because of a previous, what do you call that suicide attempt that was misinterpreted on the second comment so."
540.0,Provider,"Okay, so explain that further so."
13967.0,Patient,"I. One time okay so it's something once in high school when I had a bad rough outbreak, with a girl, and then the one recently is when my wife mistook my words when I said, this would be the last time I see my son."
540.0,Provider,Okay. And what did you end up meaning by. Like instead of the suicidal ideation What did you mean by the comment.
13967.0,Patient,"Oh it's because I was really angry, whether I was ready to divorce right then and there."
540.0,Provider,"And, have you guys, so what what's been like the problems between you guys."
13967.0,Patient,she's very controlling demanding and i'm what you would call the law of nature. Okay i'm. Good.
540.0,Provider,How long have you guys been together.
13967.0,Patient,Oh let's see we're in 2021 now. So five years.
540.0,Provider,"Five years Okay, and has this always been the dynamic where like she's had like controlling or is that something that she's like acquired in the five years."
13967.0,Patient,"she's gradually acquired there, there was a rough bringing before my son was born, where I caught her cheating on me. And it kind of made a rough dynamic for us."
540.0,Provider,And that was when when she was pregnant or before that point.
13967.0,Patient,"Well that's hard to say too, because there was an abortion that was in between all that, because of the sexual activity that she was having with other people, so I don't know where to kind of state that."
540.0,Provider,"Okay, so a lot of I mean that's that's hard in itself, because then there's some uncertainty on your end i'm sure."
13967.0,Patient,"A lot of uncertainty, but I mean now that he's gotten to the Asian size, he is a more than certain that he's mine since certain characteristics are there."
540.0,Provider,yeah you can always tell. You. really can and so have you guys ever done any type of counseling together.
13967.0,Patient,"We thought about it, we were going to do it, and then we had an even worse patch with each other, because of the thought of counseling. So it has crossed both of our minds and probably would be open to it if it was suggested to her."
540.0,Provider,"Okay yeah cuz I mean the thing about so obviously i'm your counselor, so I would. Never recommend having like the. same counselor that you have dealing in. always want to get like a neutral just I mean same thing if she had a counselor you would never want her counselor to do it. Right and."
13967.0,Patient,Just because you could apply that neutral field where nobody has a side we're say.
540.0,Provider,"Absolutely, because I mean, obviously I would have biases towards you and or I guess spices and then vice versa, if she had a therapist they would to and. let's understand. yeah so it's definitely I mean, I think that many marriages many relationships need that type of neutral ground to be able to talk through things. Especially things that are uncertain that need like that dissecting, so I would always encourage it, even if someone didn't have relationship issues at per se it's just nice to have like that neutral solid ground."
13967.0,Patient,yeah that's why people normally use their friends or friends or or close relative to mentor discuss.
540.0,Provider,Oh absolutely absolutely alright so you're here for so when did this happen. That you made to her.
13967.0,Patient,"So that happened on August 5 of this year. and started there, I was supposed to start their online sessions. i'm getting my life wrapped around the new medication that they put me on and not getting enough sleep kind of put it under the bus and then I had to reapply so."
540.0,Provider,All right.
13967.0,Patient,And then I also missed our first session because I forgot about it.
540.0,Provider,"alrighty. So anytime. You forgot a lot, you said, I mean you have dad brain to. So parents brains. As much as we can."
13967.0,Patient,"I mean, I used to have a good functioning brain, but all of a sudden, once you came into the world it's it's kind of gone so."
540.0,Provider,"Yes, that's that's parenthood. yeah. Family history of mental health any."
13967.0,Patient,family has.
540.0,Provider,substance abuse like What was it like growing up social dining room. Your family.
13967.0,Patient,"I know I know I know I know here will play with cars, while we do this okay. um so let's see in mom side there's mental illness drug abuse and prostitution, that was not only herself, but also both me and my sister. And then, on my father side their substance abuse slight recovery and then substance abuse."
540.0,Provider,"Okay, and do you remain in contact with your mom and dad."
13967.0,Patient,"Not my mom anymore, but my dad I still keep in contact periodically. Okay."
540.0,Provider,"Is your mom still here with us, or have you just distance yourself from her."
13967.0,Patient,Her my life after my dad finally got custody okay.
540.0,Provider,How old were you when that happened.
13967.0,Patient,"Oh. I was eighth grade, so I mean you're ahead of myself so should I would be what 1314 okay."
540.0,Provider,and your sister do you remain in contact with your sister.
13967.0,Patient,We are periodic but because she kept in contact with a mother there's not a lot of discussion because I don't need my life shared with others.
540.0,Provider,"And if you don't mind me asking prostitution wise, so you are a kid when your did your mom like the culprit for that."
13967.0,Patient,She was she treated us over for drugs okay.
540.0,Provider,And that was before you hit eighth grade.
13967.0,Patient,"Oh, that was before I even got out of missile."
540.0,Provider,"Did you and your sister did anyone know about that, like growing up like any your guide or even like teachers or anything."
13967.0,Patient,"There was an incident report done, I was targeted my sister was interrogated but the officers that had done the interrogation kind of wiped it under the rug because when I was a male and two there was no evidence on my sister."
540.0,Provider,So nothing I mean nothing came from that on your mom's end.
13967.0,Patient,Correct okay.
540.0,Provider,Did you I mean did you and your sister at least ever received a counseling for that growing up.
13967.0,Patient,I know I wanted to go into counseling right after the dot one the custody battle.
540.0,Provider,Okay. Okay. You said the Columbine and said.
13967.0,Patient,"yeah there was a knife in my backpack I was always raised to carry a knife with me everywhere, I go and school was one of those parameters, where I just kind of forgot."
540.0,Provider,Okay.
13967.0,Patient,"In my backpack and a bully of a young age who did some major damage to me. One day, decided to go and smart mouth man he got words and then I realized that the knife was in my bag."
540.0,Provider,So did they searched your bag.
13967.0,Patient,I handed it over to the teacher.
540.0,Provider,"And then, did you guys. Did you end up getting like suspended or."
13967.0,Patient,"I got suspended, they were planning to expelling I was alleviated as expulsion, because I went to counseling. Though I did find out that my counselor was being cheated on his wife I explained that to him at a young age, so that was hard."
540.0,Provider,So you found out that his wife is cheating on him.
13967.0,Patient,"yeah people have a specific order when they're around and out of all the sessions, she carried an extra person's odor honor."
540.0,Provider,Okay. And you're able to kind of smell that.
13967.0,Patient,"Unfortunately, when when you've lived the LIFE you've lived you you kind of."
540.0,Provider,"that's one of those unfortunate skills that you acquire and that's The thing is, when we experience things in life, our body gets us. Through those. kind of adapt for us but. Certain things, obviously. be rather left unsaid. um how long did you see that therapist for."
13967.0,Patient,"um they've had me see him two times a week for five weeks and then after five weeks. After he found out his wife and done all that. He basically closed shop and the school didn't require any further counseling at that time, based on his opinion of me."
540.0,Provider,And after. After the tent with that girlfriend so how did you attempt. Suicide when you were.
13967.0,Patient,"No, so that one was when I just turned eating."
540.0,Provider,"Okay, just turned 18 how did you attempt."
13967.0,Patient,"Oh, I went for a bridge jump Unfortunately I didn't realize that the water in the sand basin was going to act as a dampener and so when my feet actually hit the bottom, instead of doing the breaks that I expected they just kind of balanced and I went for a run."
540.0,Provider,But lucky yes right What was your thoughts when that happened so.
13967.0,Patient,And that means that somebody else had a plan for me so. i'm just kind of waiting to see what it was.
540.0,Provider,So kind of seeing the purpose and meaning. yeah okay i'm sure looking at your son i'm sure there's some of that that you can feel. Some of that.
13967.0,Patient,"You know, there are, and then there's days, where you know it seems like it's still an idea but it's not like something I have so readily activate on."
540.0,Provider,"Okay, so you still got like the thoughts no intentions."
13967.0,Patient,"yeah everyone has the thoughts, but it's the back of wanting to work going forward whether we're even premeditated into the father's."
540.0,Provider,"All right, what would you say keeps you somewhat like protected from doing that."
13967.0,Patient,Unfortunately I couldn't say that there's actually anything that really prevents me I guess at the moment he's the closest thing that actually kind of grounds me.
540.0,Provider,"Is there anything else that grounds, you do work right now."
13967.0,Patient,I work. 40 to 52 hours a week.
540.0,Provider,Oh wow What do you do.
13967.0,Patient,I work in emergency animal clinic.
540.0,Provider,"Okay, so high stress."
13967.0,Patient,Extremely yeah.
540.0,Provider,What got you into that type of work.
13967.0,Patient,The pregnancy of my son technically okay.
540.0,Provider,alright. that's fine so did you have any type of background and more wise before you went in there.
13967.0,Patient,"uh I mean I have general concepts of in knowledge i've worked in a couple shelters i've done a couple like grooming sessions inside of a private that nursing facility, but no actual like dog or cat specific."
540.0,Provider,"Okay, is that, like your end goals to like climb like and like be there, do you have any other like sites. career wise."
13967.0,Patient,"Well, no, not really I kind of go with the women at the moment."
540.0,Provider,"When okay. Sometimes, how old, are you right now."
13967.0,Patient,31 kind of think of that.
540.0,Provider,So I mean you're still in like that age bracket where it's still trying to find things out and just kind of I think it's best to be able to go on a whim.
13967.0,Patient,kind of because most times that's how you either make a success or you learn from your mistakes yeah well.
540.0,Provider,"I mean it's that adaptability, then that you've been able to acquire so."
13967.0,Patient,done almost every jobs that you can think of yeah.
540.0,Provider,So there are perks to being able to adapt. Okay. They came from not so perky places and. People I guess.
13967.0,Patient,It can be me.
540.0,Provider,"So I guess what I want to ask you now is so why is someone like you're kind of like your goal here your plan for treatment, I know you said you kind of needed it with like the suicide attempt, but what do you feel like you want to work on."
13967.0,Patient,"You know um I guess probably my memory, but."
540.0,Provider,Remember okay.
13967.0,Patient,yeah I don't think there's really much I can do for that.
540.0,Provider,"So there are, so there are some things that we can work on memory wise so. Like anything like any muscle, we have in our body, a lot of it is repetition and training and just building so it's not trying to strain your brain. But it's really trying to exercise it so if you if you could read a book for maybe like five minutes each day and then eventually starting to increase that that's how it's going to. end up increasing your brain and, like the memory that it has so there's still there are things that you can do that, we can work on memory wise."
13967.0,Patient,I don't have that kind of focus to like stay on a subject for very long.
540.0,Provider,"yeah so that's and that's that's why we have to Maybe you can start smaller so, even if we did it could be a few sentences a day, and then you start building that to a page and it's somewhat they call it like smart like smart goals, where it's like."
13967.0,Patient,We were conditioned.
540.0,Provider,"To civic yeah so it's just breaking it down to make it like manageable, but then having like the end goals like Okay, I want to read a page and remember it. Okay, so let's work on like the first few sentences. And you may have to just start doing that periodically to start increasing memory is a tricky thing, but it can be worked on, but we just have to make it very like obtainable and. Like slower, but surely goals okay okay all right So is there any questions you have for me about the program anything."
13967.0,Patient,"um no not really I mean, I was told that, basically, I had to go to therapy and but now I see this is basically a recovery baseline recruitment, so I understand where i'm going with us."
540.0,Provider,"Okay. All right, so. So yeah so I know you may have so do you need like updates for like. Who is requiring you to."
13967.0,Patient,Come to therapy i'm originally it's the program itself that's required me um.
540.0,Provider,Okay okay.
13967.0,Patient,"yeah so unfortunately that's where that kind of sets otherwise and then i'm just basically trying to see my psychologist to keep up on the medications that we're doing, most of the work they're not doing all of it, though."
540.0,Provider,"Alright, so what what will end up doing is when you and I need a lot of this has been a building rapport i'm not someone that likes to pull teeth, I definitely don't do that um. But say you ever don't connect with me never feel like there's any pressure to tell me to say hey like we're any it's not flowing it's not working for me there's so many therapists here that we have that would work so now, I always like to let people know that. never feel like crusher if you ever have to tell me that okay."
13967.0,Patient,"No worries I mean I explained that to my psychologist as well, I explained like I don't mean any ill will to women, but I don't have a very big trust with them."
540.0,Provider,That would you prefer to have a male.
13967.0,Patient,"Know cuz males kind of retro reactivate kind of cut you off beforehand women normally will try to listen to you all the way through, and then we're kind of work towards that baseline so it's easier to work with women it's just sometimes you know I just don't click on conversation okay."
540.0,Provider,"Sorry, and that's and that's why I really don't pull teeth so i'd rather us work on getting to know each other, getting to kind of have that foundation. And even if it's just us checking in and seeing how everything's going talking about your son. We can do that, we don't really if you don't right now want to talk about anything about the past, if you feel like that's something that you just wanted to move away from we don't have to do that so it's it's really your centered therapy it's what you want to get out of it. But, so what so first we're going to end up seeing each other twice a month, so i'm not very picky on how long we see each other. So, whether or not, if you want to see each other shorter so whether that's like 15 to 30 minute sessions or hour sessions that's up to you, and then we'll work our way to seeing each other, once a month. Okay Okay, and then after like you're in the program for a bit of time, then we can move to even seeing each other, like quarterly a year. So that would be like three every three months."
13967.0,Patient,Right right.
540.0,Provider,"Okay, all right perfect alright, so do you want to make our appointment. We want to make our appointments for January and then one more appointment for this month."
13967.0,Patient,"Sure, I can do that."
540.0,Provider,"Does this time work Okay, for you."
13967.0,Patient,"I do best in the morning, since I watch my son normally when I get home from work up until he falls asleep for an hour."
540.0,Provider,"Okay alright, so do you want to do this same time in two weeks, so the 27th."
13967.0,Patient,yeah I should be able to do that no problem.
540.0,Provider,"27. All right, and I guess at that point we can make our appointments for January."
13967.0,Patient,"All right, that's the perfect."
540.0,Provider,"Alright perfect alright, so thank you for meeting with me go enjoy your son, and I will see you in two weeks. Alright, by Michael. For transcription just some things to notate there does there does appear to be some emotional disconnect. And I feel like his voice was pretty consistent with the same tone throughout the session so I guess I would want to notate that and it appears that he has had a significant amount of therapy and treatment in the background, like during his adolescence. i'm a bit of trauma when it comes to his parents mom mental health substance abuse, prostitution and then she also prostituted her children for substances. So there is a bit of trauma their father substance abuse, but also recovery on and off he still has a relationship with his dad but not his mom and. Right now i'm just me working on building rapport with him that's going to be a big goal right now just trying to get him to be active in treatment that way. I do foresee that we're going to have shorter sessions i'd probably say we're going to have maybe 20 minute sessions, so I guess that's me my goal is to see him for about 20 minutes and. He does appear to have somewhat of like a non no filter so but with that flat monotone voice so. i'm going to be looking at his chart to see what other mental health diagnosis is he has which i'm going to go do now. I know he said that he just took some he has been with the Program. Had medication so that may be part of the medication that he is on. us to. Okay, so so he does have a social phobia disorder, so that would make sense, with his presentation. I that's why I also didn't push for him to put his. video on um he has ptsd. diagnosis moderate depression diagnosis. It does say that he has some legal issues of just three speeding tickets. And one con car crash, but nothing pending. But really goals for treatment right now is stabilizing on medication working on openness and treatment. potential of long term goals, would be him and his wife seeing a therapist for each other and their relationship, it appears that there is some uncertainties and some trauma that resides within the relationship. So I think that's it and then the memory, so he wants to increase his memory. All right, thank you, nothing else for transcription."
