298.0,Provider,You don't. how's your energy levels.
13070.0,Patient,"Energy levels are a little down. Okay, I get a little I get a little hyped up and then it just kind of brings down."
298.0,Provider,your ability to focus.
13070.0,Patient,it's improving it's still a little bit hard I i'm a reader and it's still a little hard for me to just try to focus on reading a book.
298.0,Provider,Okay.
13070.0,Patient,But it's definitely improving.
298.0,Provider,how's your anxiety levels.
13070.0,Patient,"anxiety is still going on and it's usually, when I wake up in the mornings and it'll last maybe half a day, where it's just really getting to me. So i've had to take some of the hydroxyl seen. lately. Just to kind of level it out."
298.0,Provider,Sorry i'm reading.
13070.0,Patient,it's okay.
298.0,Provider,here's this here's here's the problem that I run into. every single one of the medications that you are taking less weight gain as the. The the thing that's causing that you know it's in the list of things that's possible.
13070.0,Patient,Okay.
298.0,Provider,"um. We could go down on one of them. But we're I don't feel like i've had you on these long enough to go down yet because we're still building new neural. pathways in your head for not having these intrusive thoughts, so one thought I have is increasing your energy levels so that you feel more focused and have more energy to do that means adding another medication and I feel bad, but I don't want to take any of the others away from you. And so. There are maps out there that. deal with the side effect of waking but it's not like a 100% this is going to work kind of thing. So you're my suggestions to you are that. there's wellbutrin."
13070.0,Patient,Okay.
298.0,Provider,That will that will increase your focus increase your energy it has if it's an antidepressant that works on dopa mean. We could not do anything we could do that one if you failed on that one we could look at something like adderall at a really low dose to see if that's you know perks up your metabolism we don't have to what are your thoughts.
13070.0,Patient,I like to do something about the weight gain because it's it's really easy to to gain the way but it's really hard to lose it.
298.0,Provider,"As an and my suggestion is to go with wellbutrin we use it to get off those side effects of weight gain. Is it perfect no but it's it would be we'd see how you respond to it if you start getting more driven and and your appetite goes down, and you have more energy than it's the right one, there is a medication out there called topiramate that's used for. weight loss that we use with our meds but i'm not a favorite of it, because it has a side effect of cognitive doling where you just don't feel like you're sharp anymore, and to me that would bother me more than anything. If I. feel like I was really sharp the downside of wellbutrin. Is if you are one of those people that it gives you anxiety because we give you energy I don't know we don't know if we give you more energy does that give you more anxiety I don't know too we try. So you have to you know write me and tell me, yes I doing more and i'm up and i'm moving and it's working, but I don't like the anxiety part. um so um. Any suicidal or homicidal thoughts."
13070.0,Patient,No none.
298.0,Provider,"Okay. And you are good to go and try the wellbutrin talk to me and group send me a chat saying yes, this works, but I think it could do better, because I only started you at a small dose. i'll see how you respond okay."
13070.0,Patient,Okay.
298.0,Provider,"All right, syrah take care."
13070.0,Patient,They.
298.0,Provider,Maybe those. Are adorable.
13070.0,Patient,"Thank you very much, he is he's a wild one. bye bye."
