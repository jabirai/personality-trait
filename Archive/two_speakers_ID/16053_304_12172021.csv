16053.0,Patient,"Well, yes, I was waiting and waiting and then I. just have to ask your opinions I think it's really stupid, so I had plans to mom my mom's really sick, so I have plans to help her out with like the Elf on the shelf thing and. I told Andy this I told him I was leaving early and like he was going to clean his cars. And he's never usually home until like three in the afternoon, so I just figured he wouldn't be home and then you know he tells me he's gonna be home in 1015 minutes. And he gets mad because I didn't make them breakfast I have to go she knows all to stop because I need to take care of the House and is my man before I bought into stop for the day, even though he gave me two minutes trying to leave."
304.0,Provider,yeah no that's not.
16053.0,Patient,"Like What do you mean I like I told you, I told you like."
304.0,Provider,So things are are not any better with him kind of the same.
16053.0,Patient,We just like he just thinks he's always right and like it just that's how it always is he thinks he's always right. So I just I don't know. He just thinks he's always right.
304.0,Provider,"Do you guys talk to you did you talk to him, are you able to say to him, like no i'm not making breakfast."
16053.0,Patient,"Well, I tried to tell him, just like you know. So it's like, of course, I mean I can't do it because it gave me no time at all. So I mean I like I was just like I can't do it. no time at all to do it's like yeah."
304.0,Provider,And how did you respond to that.
16053.0,Patient,"It was just like oh so you could have done it you still could have done. hmm so there was a it was a fight again because he says, I still could have done it. So. yeah and it's just because, like I said he's always right and then you know his sister stayed at the House two nights ago again because you know she walks all over I mean he doesn't think so. You just eat always okay he's just like she's staying here for the night was thinking like that's not like a reason to stay at the House because. because she has to go to her boyfriends and next day or something i'm like that's not a reason. So."
304.0,Provider,"So she's saying i'm like not not living there, as much as she back and forth."
16053.0,Patient,"Well yeah and that's just like that's still not like that's not something she should I just don't agree with that either then you're disrupting the House at 1030 when you come home at night, because you have nowhere else to go it's our fault that you want to eat."
304.0,Provider,Right.
16053.0,Patient,"So it's just like. there's always just super soft like I couldn't say anything to him about that, because that would you started a fight."
304.0,Provider,been together.
16053.0,Patient,For seven years.
304.0,Provider,and has it has it always been like this.
16053.0,Patient,um. This year. i'd say the shirt is probably definitely but definitely been the words. it's just like he's so like he's just gotten like nuts.
304.0,Provider,What do you mean by that.
16053.0,Patient,"is just. Like jumps off on anything is always break. I feel like when things are going good he likes to start a fight so there's some kind of like chaos and he'll stay like that's me, but like I don't like fighting so like I don't I disagree with that highly so. You know I just I think he likes fighting sometimes I don't know like or like to just talk down to me or something. Sometimes I feel like he likes doing that. he's done he has power over me or something I don't know I just don't I usually just don't say stupid stuff like that, but that's like everything's fine started fight it just weird to me. Hello."
304.0,Provider,"Well, there seems like a lot of unhealthy behaviors."
16053.0,Patient,That was just kind of like ridiculous i'm just like. They understand.
304.0,Provider,So tell me what was happening Courtney when you were thinking about leaving.
16053.0,Patient,"Oh that's because, like there was a huge fight. Like I said him and his sister yelling at me because Andy Andy fields to need to always justify his face with. What he always brings discount like it's just like whoever's at the House, he brings them involved in says it's because he needs a witness, but I know just does it so like. Obviously, your family is going to be somebody on your side, they will never to 70 you know I mean they always are going to choose your side because that's just how they are. So I mean I don't know i'm just like they're both screaming at me i'm like that was it, I wanted to eat, I was like I was like Fuck this I said and kingsley that he's getting mad because I like i'm holding generally but I told them i'm like kinsey saved by a need like he. knows that, like it's just not right, you know, like she's always saying stuff like. i'm. stairway are like just sounds like stone yeah my mom me sick stuff like that, and like to me I just not healthy and I don't I don't like I don't like it. So that's good I mean it was like non stop for a week and then you know let's fight we had he kicked the gate off the wall and done to our new friends, he called his mom at night. And the situation we're far until the night, but like that was the firearm like you know Andy I can't continue to do this, and I said, if you want to do it like. I just i'm not i'm not into this anymore so like we keep fighting like this, I was like i'm done and i'm like we're going to go back to our core order so you'll have kinsley. I think he only had like two or three days a week, not even like that's that's what it's going to have to go back to you because, like the way we're living right now is just it's not it so. And we haven't had a fight like that, but even this morning just with the whole like Well, no, no, you should have made me, you should have taken care of your man before you left it's like. No, I told you, I had to leave at a certain time, and you expect me to run rampant and so you're happy and it's like I cook for you every fucking day of the week I do everything every single day of the week, so I got the House is spotless because you mean not because of you."
304.0,Provider,Right. So you. had been separated before other times in your relationship you've left.
16053.0,Patient,"We separated. separated for like I would say, nine I don't remember how long it was very nine months. Because. We want to court. So I mean we worship. me, we are definitely yeah we are separated for a little bit yeah. yeah."
304.0,Provider,"yeah well. yeah just I mean a lot of unhealthy behaviors Courtney, I mean for both of you, I mean kingsley's hearing all of this she's seeing all of this. And that's really unfair to you if he involved six family members right in. A private conversation."
16053.0,Patient,"yeah that's all day. that's where it is like he. He involves them and then. He just like he made a big deal that my mom got involved in a lot of stuff so I I did I stopped playing my mom because that's what he wanted, so I was like Okay, I understand that. You have a real like I understand that so i'm just I will do that anymore I get where you're coming from and then that night, like the night, I told you a kick to get off the wall, he kicked me out of the House so here's. My have showers gonna leave by Tom like hey. Like with kinsley like. You know. And everything else on the back. For new moms. So he. died. See Paul her mom so and girls like know see you just go straight to jumpy like down her throat to blame her when it's like you called your mind, because you did it like I had no part and that's. Like never spamming you against me so mad and tell them everything and like you know you can shift in front of kids with you like. jazz not white I took them out check away and core to almost two months without I mean that that was like on him no it wasn't it wasn't on me he's the one that decided to do that, because you want to think his way. So. Everything just kind of stemmed from from there, I guess, I mean."
304.0,Provider,yeah.
16053.0,Patient,"But he he just like he likes he likes to blame everybody else, and like. He knows that this problem so i'm just like well yeah i'm like it is it that is a big problem you have like it doesn't get you far if you haven't noticed doesn't get you far so. yeah I mean it's just I don't know it's just like after that, like even the other night like he got mad at me he called me a piece of shit and it's just like. i'm just getting used to, and like you know kids he hears it and then kids he's like no she's not just like Oh, this is just getting all this is getting all so. yeah. I mean i'm just getting used to all the. chaos and all the other shirts so."
304.0,Provider,"You know this isn't good for you, you know it's not good for kinsley."
16053.0,Patient,"Oh it's not 100% yeah and i'm just like you know it like i'm not doing this much longer so you've got to figure it out or. I will I don't leave I don't need to be there, I mean that's like in a way, like you think I mean because it screws him over the long run, because. You won't see her as often so it's like that's a new, because you don't know how to keep your mouth shut like you know darryl tell them that, like he doesn't. He doesn't know how to just like shots. He always has to like get the last word, and like I said he gets his family involved in like he's just or does her shit and like. She texted me something stupid yesterday is not going to come back and like. Just stupid stuff and i'm just like I don't know what you're talking about she's like well I feel like you just don't want me there and it's just like i'd love to say yeah I don't because you cause havoc in the House and. anytime that she's there that's when the fighting is it's like the whole week, she was gone, I mean who didn't fight one time and then she comes back and we're fighting again it's just like. it's probably because I resent him for not kicking around a long time ago and it's like cheese there I my whole entire personality changes. Because I don't like her. Right I don't want her on my kid and like. You know the thing is like a new shoe had drugs in or like popping pills and stuff knows quite a while back. That it was her in there, and he knew there was drugs in a religious didn't care like she didn't care about it."
304.0,Provider,yeah that's very concerning.
16053.0,Patient,"Definitely and i'm like. It just like it was just stupid stupid, unlike you know. You literally knew. that she had stuff in a room and you still didn't care. So it's just like. i'm just. yeah I mean when you say i'll walk because she has xanax Rome and i'm just like just Oh, just because she has seminar room that's not a big deal to me, is a big deal. I used to have a lot of so like just like stupid stupid stuff. um so yeah I don't I don't know it's just. I just like you know I want things to work as I mean I would do care about each other, and I mean obviously like a benefit kinsey but it's just like I don't know. Sometimes, I think it can work and sometimes i'm like God it's definitely not going to work and it's even today with the whole like. cooking breakfast thing it's like you knew I had to leave and like you know when he called his mom he brought up me go on and on and he you know his mom was just like you know, an aunty she second if she wants to go there every day she can and he's so good to me problems boggle. I don't know I just feel like he'll be fine with it, and then, when it doesn't benefit him or it gets in the way of stuff that he's mad again. So."
304.0,Provider,Well it's according you know you both have to be willing to make the effort.
16053.0,Patient,yeah.
304.0,Provider,"And he has to acknowledge that he needs to change that things need to change things are not good, the way they are right now."
16053.0,Patient,"Well, they saw. small one. Like at all like that even like getting guests right so we're talking largest global online it's like I want you don't even know when we did the way our whiteboard stuff. So it's just like yeah things don't change that i'm just yeah i'm just kind of getting to the point where it's like it's not fun anymore so. Just like this morning i'm just like nothing was that big of a deal you purchase major. And I did make the all New York sounds just like okay i'll just do it, so I put it in the microwave that you don't understand how to make oatmeal in the microwave or just common sense. So then he got upset about that and then he couldn't give a kinzer this morning he was upset about it was just one thing after another i'm just like you know what. you're gonna have to deal with it yourself. yeah I don't so the stuff that he gets mad about. I don't know I mean. How it has to be over soon I just got to get to that and and then whatever happens. So."
