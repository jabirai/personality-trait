12730.0,Patient,I about gift. yeah yeah I was like four. o'clock oh God we switched it to one so. i'm a few minutes late but i'm here.
480.0,Provider,"about your email yesterday. So anytime you have no shows, even if you tell us after the fact, what happened, it affects your prescription, so people that we're bridging for you should not have given you a whole week. Okay, the issue that we talked about a lot in group with like doctors being held liable that's kind of why we do, that is, because if they don't see you face to face, then it can affect her licensing if she gives you more than certain prescription."
12730.0,Patient,Oh yeah oh.
480.0,Provider,"yeah so that's the thing with compliance like there's certain things she talked sometimes about like she can override one thing, but if there's a couple things going on, she can't override them for prescriptions. And it's like you're in drug screen in missed appointments Those are the two things that she can't override both she can override one but not both of them."
12730.0,Patient,"Okay, already I understand."
480.0,Provider,"i'm sorry it's so inconvenient for you, though, because."
12730.0,Patient,yeah it's rough but I mean i'm you gotta do what you gotta do you know yeah and i'm working on the missing stuff and oversleep and I just I have been so exhausted like I don't I think mentally and physically i'm just wiped out and there's no excuse for over sleeping at all I just.
480.0,Provider,Do you think is mainly obviously I know the emotional part with living with mom and that's become such an issue physically do you feel like it's anxiety affecting you physically or do you think there's more physical stuff going on.
12730.0,Patient,"Well, I have, I have rheumatoid arthritis. And fibromyalgia and. about the list this long of things wrong with me and I take absolutely no medication whatsoever, and I was on medication yeah I was on medication, since I was 15 and I told my family doctor I wanted to give my body, a break. Because that was on anti-psychotics well since I was 15 years old, since I was diagnosed with bipolar."
480.0,Provider,"Okay, remember that yes. I didn't realize, I thought you were just giving yourself a break from the bipolar meds I didn't realize it was from all met."
12730.0,Patient,So.
480.0,Provider,"You have nothing, as far as treating the rheumatoid arthritis rheumatoid arthritis and fibromyalgia. No suboxone because those do like suboxone does help with some of that stuff just not. always, to the extent people need it to help."
12730.0,Patient,"yeah yeah. i've been using I don't know if you believe in, like the essential oils and stuff."
480.0,Provider,mm hmm.
12730.0,Patient,"i've been using those and you know it's. it's becoming more than I can take the pain and yeah the fatigue, because I well there's so much expected of me from my kids from Jacob from my parents and is wearing me down fast really fast it's kind of scared me that. I see my family got there on the 14th. And i'm going to talk to her about you know what's been going on and see what she thinks I should do and I don't want to be on a lot of medicine for anything."
480.0,Provider,"that's understandable, are you on anything other than. The. suboxone."
12730.0,Patient,nope i've been asked to make a daily out well I take apple cider vinegar. about a month. Okay i'll take those. But other than that. Not only anything.
480.0,Provider,"Okay, and okay so going back to the whole everyone's expecting a lot out of you so. let's go through this, what are you expected to do that is not absolutely necessary, because at this point, obviously you're not going to do anything if you get to a point where your body just collapses because you're so exhausted so. Are there things that people are expecting from you that. necessary. To be your responsibility."
12730.0,Patient,um. I mean you know with the housework and stuff nobody helps the girls don't help my mom does. You know jake is.
480.0,Provider,helping her own House.
12730.0,Patient,"No i'm expect because she works and I don't i'm expected to keep the House clean. Oh cheese yeah like I clean up after six people. And they I mean it's that you know my girls are so freaking sport like it's ridiculous, you know they my 10 year old she's like she's on pointing right now for 10 days, she. I can say the past couple of days since she's kind of seen firsthand what the crap i'll take off of Jacob and my mom. she's been she's seen it she's seen them putting me down and yelling and screaming and I don't want her to see that. I don't want her around that. But she kind of she was in another room and heard. My mom some comments she made and yeah she's like mom i'm sorry i'm going to try to help you more. i'm sorry I didn't realize and that's she's 10 years old, you know beach yes. yeah you know she's not got to be a kid she's not because. yeah yeah and my mom she's she treats Victoria like she's a frickin Queen and. tweets live like she's second best it's just. I think things would be a lot better effects on somewhere else. yeah."
480.0,Provider,"cuz that's a lot of I feel like okay so. With living with your mom there's constant ptsd triggers for you and trauma triggers and it's really hard to heal in an environment where you're still being triggered constantly because the way she's the. What you're, seeing as different treatment towards both of your daughters is probably internalized and pulling up stuff from your childhood. And so it's just an endless cycle of constantly being triggered which no wonder, you always feel exhausted, because if you're constantly triggered your body and your brain are constantly trying to fight off the triggers and the emotions and all of that. So I do think yes that's definitely like long term goal obviously get your own place but then what are some short term goals in the meantime that can help you to feel sane and functional you know."
12730.0,Patient,"I don't know anymore, you know. i'm. i'm willing to take any help I can get because I just. Am at the end of my rope you know I just. i've taken, all I can date in like get upset or anything I get. told that I want a pity party or to grow up. You know i'm not supposed to get upset i'm not supposed to cry i'm a very i'm an emotional person as."
480.0,Provider,"Well, and like we talked about in group yesterday, like the whole empath experience it's. You can't tell somebody to change how they were wired right so basically them saying you're too emotional, you need to stop the pity parties is them asking you to change how you were wired which is not possible."
12730.0,Patient,Exactly.
480.0,Provider,"necessary to that's The thing is, like it's not a bad thing to be emotional it's just your emotions are triggering other people and they don't like that they're being triggered and they don't know how to handle their own triggers."
12730.0,Patient,Right exactly.
480.0,Provider,Is it an option to go stay with your dad with the girls.
12730.0,Patient,"i'm. i'm not sure he lives with my uncle now his brother. And they have. They have an extra bedroom there. met I don't know I haven't even thought about that I really have it, and I know my dad getting money from the House where it was sold my grandmother's house. they'll probably get each about probably about 26,000 each of the boys will probably a date that's what it was might have been 56 it's a good amount of money it's enough money to get into a place, and he told me he would help me. So in the House is."
480.0,Provider,When is that supposed to be done.
12730.0,Patient,They just closed on the House last.
480.0,Provider,Oh good.
12730.0,Patient,"Okay yeah so it's going to be in the near future. Very few. He told me he said i'll help you as long as I can live with you and I said ahead and that's when my dad's. You know we've always been close to 72. mm hmm and he said, you know, he said I couldn't. Even I couldn't die, knowing that you weren't taking care of. yeah. geez."

12730.0,Patient,"No it's not oh my God, why did you get that. Know i've got my marriage in the lockbox. yeah they're all my medicine everything that killer is in them well in my life, but she got her little stalking it was underneath the bathroom sink so she opened the door and got it out."
480.0,Provider,"wow, so there is no safe hiding place in your House from the dog."

12730.0,Patient,Know they're they're not important. Well it's. Jacob sauce that you can wait. Here cooking go on take your cookie and go. She is for. Various board and she have never seen a dog that can open doors and open cabinets and she can.
480.0,Provider,Smart.
12730.0,Patient,She is i'm gonna have to get you know the little toddler locks. On doors yeah.
480.0,Provider,"funny. Oh, my God is that your dog like when you move you're gonna take her."
12730.0,Patient,"Yes, she's mad. Mad dog she's like yeah I love her like she's a kid and I don't know i've never been this attached to an animal it's I don't know what it is, but she's she's like my therapy dog she. yeah they all I mean she sleeps in the bed with me at night, she like has to be with me at all times that she's a really good dog she's sweet and. that's making me mad. you've got to interrupt me now see and that's the way it is like, if I don't make myself available 24 seven it's what are you doing why couldn't you drop what you were doing and talk to me it's like anything I do is not have important to nobody."
480.0,Provider,that's.
12730.0,Patient,"It is it's really frustrating it's like you know I need this and. I don't know my mom when I OD when I was 15 you know she went to our Alan on that, how do you. it's yeah she went to that because she didn't understand she's never. done drugs drink or nothing. So she really didn't understand why. I take a hold of me. And for a while she was really supportive. of me and understanding and it's like she always thinks like you should be over this, but now, why do you let it still have a hold of you, you know why do you have to have this medication why in. You know because I do i'm sorry this is, who I am I can't change, all I can do is better myself from the past."
480.0,Provider,"And yeah it's like it's frustrating when people don't see addiction as a disease, because it's just like if you had cancer, you would treat it with chemo and. If you have addiction, you need to treat it with therapy usually trauma work usually some sort of medication to deal with the underlying issues that lead to the addiction in the first place so. it's very frustrating when people won't take the time, especially when they have someone close to them that struggles, with it, when they won't take the time to understand. How addiction works, because anyone that takes the time to understand how it works, they know it's not like a willpower thing it's not a. I should be stronger than this type of thing like it's literally chemical imbalances in your brain mixed with a whole bunch of trauma responses and. Like we were talking about in group, a lot of onyx tend to be empathic and that's why the drugs feel so good, is because it blocks out all the extra stuff."
12730.0,Patient,"yeah exactly, and you know really thought that she understood that that it was a disease it's it's it's like you said it's frustrating. it's very frustrating that they look at it like well, you should be stronger than that you know you shouldn't let that take a hold of you and. You should be over it by now that's The one thing that blows my mind, you should be over this, for now, and i'm like are you kidding me, I have a debilitating disease that. davila."
480.0,Provider,"Does like that's the difference it doesn't just go away when you stop using your disease is still acting on your brain, the same as it was as if you were still using when you're not using."
12730.0,Patient,yeah exactly it just it blows my mind that people can't comprehend that it is now.
480.0,Provider,"Okay, so until you can move out. let's come up with some things that can help as far as just coping and. So your daughter's gonna help a little bit with housekeeping stuff is there, like a list of chores you can give to both daughters to help."
12730.0,Patient,"yeah I got I went online and printed out some chores sheets. See i'm homeschooling my 16 year old. Again, and i'm a homeschooling my cousin's daughter she's in ninth grade so. yeah i'm homeschooled kids."
480.0,Provider,A whole house and being a mom and dealing with your recovery. that's too much.
12730.0,Patient,"yeah I am I took on my cousin's daughter because her parents are real bad they're really, really bad on man, really, really bad and. If I hadn't took her own she she wouldn't get an education at all, they didn't care she went to school, the law in the SS did nothing, absolutely nothing to these parents for this child not being in school. They didn't do anything I mean they went up and did a home visit like I don't know who called on them idea and I don't mean DSS, but it has a few times and. I think there's some people that works for him that are genuine and true but, most of them are just their worst addicts, then the people they're coming to visit so yeah i'd go another route, but the SS was called on them and they did go to their home but she's like oh everything's fun. And i'm like."
480.0,Provider,How.
12730.0,Patient,"yeah if that had been me it's been out there, probably want me out in handcuffs or something you know and oh you're considering vss STD now but i'm homeschooling her and she is she is beyond brilliant I mean this girl. I mean her IQ has to be out the roof she's doing like college work and she's in ninth grade she her. And I you know I continue to build her up and tell her. You can be anybody you want, and you can do anything you want, you do not let what your parents have done, you know define who you are so she's. she's a good kid plus i've got my 16 year old and i'm homeschooling and she's she works, she does work, her boyfriend works in there yeah they work they both work at subway here in town. Oh, and they're really good workers they'll work their butts off, but around here. Help them with their sister. So we're working on that, though. That yeah i'm i'm holding off."
480.0,Provider,Where do you find your strength and sanity. In this meantime it's just like pouring everything you can into the kids right like like you said you are literally parenting your cousin's kid.
12730.0,Patient,And you're the.
480.0,Provider,"One positive influence she has in your life so holding on to this idea that, at least, if I can be present with these kids I am a positive influence that's having some sort of effect that tends to make the overwhelming stuff fall to the background."
12730.0,Patient,"yeah it helps a lot, I feel like I feel like. Like i'm like i'm needed. almost like a theme."
480.0,Provider,"and appreciate it, you know, even if they don't say oh you're appreciate it."
12730.0,Patient,"Oh yeah definitely, and that means a lot yeah you know coming from not feeling wanted and a shame that takes all those feelings like you said, and it puts them in the bag and. I just kind of pushing yeah so there's there's some positive in my life, you know my girls are. I feel like God kept me here to meet their mom and i've not been the best mom I couldn't be in in they understand. You know i've never heard anything from them, I don't want to one. You know they they they know I struggle with addiction and alcoholism and you know they still love me they don't hold it against me and that's amazing yeah if more adults kids the world would be a much better place."
480.0,Provider,Oh it's so true that's so so true. i'm seeing you again in two weeks on the 23rd at one o'clock.
12730.0,Patient,"Yes, I am."
480.0,Provider,i've got a. group next week you're not going to sleep through.
12730.0,Patient,No. No. I won't sleep through it i'll make sure i've got like. All my alarm set I have like four alarms in my room so.
480.0,Provider,takes what it takes right.
12730.0,Patient,You gotta do what you gotta do yeah.
480.0,Provider,"Oh well, i'm glad we got to chat and, as always, email me in the meantime if stuff comes up, but hopefully by next time we talk at least there'll be some sort of like plan for moving."
12730.0,Patient,"That would be awesome I know i'm hoping. i've been searching for a places So hopefully we'll find a place and can I think that'll make things a lot better, I really do I won't have that like you said, the constant triggers and negativity."
480.0,Provider,And you'll have support you'll have more like uplifting positive feedback.
