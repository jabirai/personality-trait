12876.0,Patient,"tone stay away from the people that he was around you know, because if you go back around that same crowd you're bound they're gonna do it again, you know. Right that's like i've done this time I got out i've gone around nobody I haven't had anybody come over I haven't tried contact in any of my old friends or anybody in that line of know like I was doing before I went to prison. And it's working out pretty well and everything seems to be going great for Max oh."

Congratulations here wait for that two year my."
408.0,Provider,Right right that's good. That would be a big achievement.
12876.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
408.0,Provider,All of the people. family members you're mentioning that you're spending time with their also we're also.
12876.0,Patient,"Yes, yep. yep. All that buddy of mine is you know if I can do it, you can do it, you know I said, you know how about I was I said he was right there with me, for the most of the time till I said so, if I can stay clean, I know you can. know what you're doing for his children."
408.0,Provider,"Yes, that's a huge motivator huge motivator isn't it."
12876.0,Patient,"yeah there's I was happy to him the other morning because we had to finish up a job Saturday. morning he said no, I feel so much better he goes in two weeks, playing on xbox and he goes I just feel so much better he goes. The aches and pains are there, but that's what i'm gonna have to get used to say exactly that's definitely gonna have to get used to it, because it does you know I got i've broken both my elbows and. You know, an arrest and every morning I wake up my elbows staff barely move on just excruciating pain, but I don't. want to go back to the note so i'm not gonna deal with the pain."
408.0,Provider,So it's important to learn some additional non medication pain management strategies at this point in your recovery and that's part of my responsibility is to work with you on learning those. And of course they're not quick and easy. quick and easy solutions right.
12876.0,Patient,CBD.
408.0,Provider,"Well i'm not talking about any kind of medication i'm saying there are. Things you can do without any substances at all that will alleviate pain, over time, but they take practice. So that's my job to work with you on, and you can certainly try other. over the counter or adjunct. approaches, you know medicine."
12876.0,Patient,so forth.
408.0,Provider,But you do need to coordinate those with your medical prescriber.
12876.0,Patient,Right yeah.
408.0,Provider,"Right, even if it's like you say it's the oil for pain, make sure you let your prescriber know and that you coordinate with them. Because a lot of things you know do have different psychoactive ingredients in them, including nicotine and caffeine."
12876.0,Patient,yep.
408.0,Provider,"So that's why it's a good idea for your own best interest to make sure that your prescriber is fully aware of anything. You are adding to your body, whether it's on your skin or whether you're adjusting and."
12876.0,Patient,Right yeah yeah i've tried that solve that they got the CBD solve that.
408.0,Provider,Work yeah.
12876.0,Patient,"Years ago, one of my buddies told me, I tried that years and years ago, but now I can't find it."
408.0,Provider,"yeah yeah. Sure, now the the behavioral pain management methods that we work on some of them we introduced I introduced during each group so some of them are the special breathing and mental focusing exercises that we're using just for emotional regulation. Raw and mood support, but they can also work for payment. So, but but it takes a lot of practice practice right for the pain management piece is like you have to do it, like every day and four times a week for a while. When you shoot. The surface in your brain. yeah so that it becomes more automatic. to trigger that relaxation response. That competes with the pain messages that are coming from your peripheral nervous system at from the injury sites. Right like your elbows. arousal messages will compete with those. As well as using specific behavioral exercises. That can relax all the surrounding tissues around the injury site that is generating the pain. So um the research that's been done on this has found that even people who, if you look at their X Ray or, if you look at their MRI they. have extensive deterioration and scar tissue at a particular point in their skeleton or their anatomy. with appropriate exercises mentally and physically. They have mobility and they're not having pain most days of the week. You see what I mean which you wouldn't think if you just looked. At their X Ray. it's kind of like mind over matter, except your mind is matter right your brain is an organ."
12876.0,Patient,Mind over matter.
408.0,Provider,But it's really brain is matter so you're just using it more fully.
12876.0,Patient,Right exactly.
408.0,Provider,to compete with the pain signals.
12876.0,Patient,"Right. Well, I don't mind if they don't. If I don't mind it don't matter something like."
408.0,Provider,"that's one of the old pieces of wisdom right. So so that's distraction right if you don't mind if you're not paying attention to paying. you're paying attention to something else, so, certainly if you're involved in something else you don't know the pain as much, but then, when you lie down to fall asleep at night. And you notice the pain."
12876.0,Patient,Good warm very nice real now.
408.0,Provider,yeah yeah so that's a good example of what you were just saying.
12876.0,Patient,Right exactly.
408.0,Provider,"Now, in addition to staying away from people split people places and things. That remind you of drug use, what else, are you doing to relapse prevention."
12876.0,Patient,"Ah. Well i've been doing much for the past couple of months now i've had a few death in the family, but. right back on my track i've been getting ready for when I cottonwood and whatnot and get my firewood and everything so."
408.0,Provider,What do you use to cut your would. During hurricane So do you ever take a piece of a of a branch or piece of wood and just do an old good old fashioned X.
12876.0,Patient,"I got X, I guess, but I split it all by hand so."
408.0,Provider,That actually. yeah that's it that's like therapy.
12876.0,Patient,"yeah. When I heard a. program up there, oh really want program but you go out in the woods and split firewood because they. Had orders like a court order for the state parks at a contract in the state parks and sell firewood state parks, sometimes not so I got a lot of practice plus I have grown up I worked in the woods has a kid with my father grew up behind."
408.0,Provider,"You have that you have. What i'm giving you a little different blends or perspective on that specific activity. Is when you do that. It helps you to focus your attention on the task at hand. You know, you know I cut off your finger right."
12876.0,Patient,"yeah I see that happened when I was in prison, this kid was using would split and Plus we had axes and splint Moss and he never ran I was putting before he got his finger cotton behind the. tip of his finger right oh. ouch yeah."
408.0,Provider,"i'm chopping wood, I recommend now for a mindfulness. Non tech me. run my mindfulness i'm talking about. Extra focusing for just a few minutes. love your brain on. A movement on a movement so you're dropping. Work right motion so repetitive motion. So what i'd like you to do next time you chop the wood if you'll try this out. You slow down. For a few minutes. And you're not thinking about getting the job done for a few minutes you're just thinking about the movement."
12876.0,Patient,Right right.
408.0,Provider,"And you're paying attention for safety, but also to really focus in your attention to your living in brain arrest. you're giving your brain arrest from busy busy busy. get it done get it done. But you're also giving it a rest. From just zoning out on nothing."
12876.0,Patient,Right yeah exactly.
408.0,Provider,"you're focused. yo you see what i'm saying. So try slowing down a few minutes at a time. The other way that you can try, if you're careful is use your non dominant hand. up with your non dominant."
12876.0,Patient,arm and he'll definitely.
408.0,Provider,That will focus your attention for sure.
12876.0,Patient,yeah well tricky.
408.0,Provider,And also you're engaging a different set of neural circuits. connecting with a different set of muscles. So.
12876.0,Patient,"Normally don't use because you always do something like a certain way right. That. I got like I don't know certain things I do in my life and certain things I do in my right, but like just that way I don't understand it, but I write left handed so. yeah."
408.0,Provider,"Which hands, which side you use for what chopping."
12876.0,Patient,"Well, I put the bottom of X my left hand and. I guess us right here, I swing yeah swing with left right. Left towards the water stand to the right side and over swing with my right."
408.0,Provider,"Okay, so. So for this mindfulness exercise. you're recommending you try doing that very slowly, for a few chops a few swings. And then reverse reverse. And come on the other direction for a few swings and you're also breathing. Right. you're focused on. noticing every sensation of the movement how your muscles feel how your joints feel. The point of impact point of impact with the wood. Right, the smell of the wood, when you make impact. Right i'm saying and you're breathing slowly, so that you could just focus on that for a few minutes. Try it and let me know in our next session what your experiences with that. And if it's a if it's something that maybe benefits you right like in the ways we're talking about maybe do it again next time we chop watch."
12876.0,Patient,yeah I plan on doing some more after we get done with I mean if I have time enough so.
408.0,Provider,You can try it out try it out yeah yeah. Of course it's getting dark earlier and earlier now.

12876.0,Patient,"yeah that's right, and then we all go into hibernation mode. yeah yeah wait for the ice to freeze on go ice fishing."
408.0,Provider,Right now there's a mindfulness section.
12876.0,Patient,yeah definitely I love ice fishing.
408.0,Provider,Right once you're sitting there with your. gear yeah.

12876.0,Patient,"Well, we get up early."
408.0,Provider,Right.
12876.0,Patient,"Four o'clock going work getting the job site just come and be like that way we get more jobs done and whatnot but sometimes it slows down in the one or two depending I just my girlfriend she cleans up. was a B and b's whatever that was at camps, she cleans this camp for. me yeah yeah and. She the lady needed someone to plow Java snowboard and she gave me the job that she said she got snow blowing a garage and said every storm every three inches we get should give me $50 a snowboard. Okay yeah i'll do that. Know you've got a winter winter job when you're."
408.0,Provider,Your day job okay.
12876.0,Patient,"yeah I just saw an ad in the newspaper today for saw mill Sebastian look, I think it was last book lumber mill over in St ALBAN that's only 10 minutes for me, I think about going over that applying need several positions filled."
408.0,Provider,yeah so that's an all indoor job.
12876.0,Patient,indoor outdoor depending what's doing but.
408.0,Provider,I see that there but they don't stop for the winter.
12876.0,Patient,"No, no. year round."
408.0,Provider,Well that's good so you're keeping busy now taking that job at the sawmill will that potentially expose you to other people who are still actively using substances.
12876.0,Patient,"Could yes most definitely. But I don't I don't know yet. Until I get your I got apply for so but still. Definitely not doing that route again i've been there, done that, and no fun."
408.0,Provider,And do you have some. routines or scripts that you use if you're in that situation if people are approaching you.
12876.0,Patient,"know I just tell them again last go by, like I don't do that. straight up one person i'll tell you how I see it, so. yeah."
408.0,Provider,"Okay, do we need to bring this session to a close, then, now that she's home."
12876.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
408.0,Provider,"All right, what's, the best thing that has happened to you in the past two weeks we're not talking about the deaths, obviously, or the other bad things so what would you say, is the best thing, where you felt good or where you had a moment of joy."
12876.0,Patient,Working that's I enjoy myself doing that so.
408.0,Provider,Okay yeah.
12876.0,Patient,Keep me busy.
408.0,Provider,"And what's an example of something that you did that was out kind of out of the ordinary routine maybe for variety or recreation, or just to try something new."
12876.0,Patient,"i'm really done much as I just come home from work, no matter. What, no one has comments so i'm sure there'll be other things i'm doing."
408.0,Provider,"Okay, have you ever had any physical therapy for your elbows."
12876.0,Patient,yeah years and years ago.
408.0,Provider,Good show me one physical therapy exercise that you can remember from back then that helped with your elbows.
12876.0,Patient,"Five years old, I remember. Well pulley system thing that we would hook up doorframe. I can't wait on it or not, but I don't have to try to exercise straighten it out like almost like a pull down like pull up."
408.0,Provider,"almost like you, are climbing and imaginary rope almost."
12876.0,Patient,"yeah something like that yeah I was young, five, six years old bro."
408.0,Provider,"Alright, so here's another thought Mr big more is next time your elbows are aching like maybe when you lie down to go to bed. And you don't have anything to distract you. So they started aching. Try sitting up in bed and just doing that pulling down exercise to warm up. All that area, all the area right. Around each elbow breathing slowly and you don't have to use weight you're just using your own. muscle tightening called isometric so have you ever heard of that. I saw metrics."
12876.0,Patient,If not i'll figure I have. heard I just set up and i've. worked my back and forth like this.
408.0,Provider,Why so this time try reaching up. Like the physical therapist showed you to do. And what you're doing is you're gonna without the use of weights isometric exercises or muscle contractions. specific groups that muscle contractions. Without even using a weight just using your own body. Contract all those muscles. To drill down. Right and then you might do a. Like you're shutting a window or raising a window.
12876.0,Patient,Right.
408.0,Provider,"If you, similar to what you just showed me."
12876.0,Patient,Right it's.
408.0,Provider,"very similar to that and do those with slowly with deep breathing because the breath will bring oxygen to the site that you're exercising. That can reduce the pain sensation as well. And then, after you do that lie back down. and try doing some progressive muscle relaxation until you're sleepy. What I mean by that. Just like. start the top of your head down to your toes or your toes up top of your head you're just lying there slowly tightening and releasing each muscle group."
12876.0,Patient,"know, therefore, I can do that."
408.0,Provider,Try that all right. What do you do on a Saturday in two weeks that would be the 16th.
12876.0,Patient,I don't know we can tell time up for that.
408.0,Provider,"All right, sir. What about three o'clock. Four o'clock your time four o'clock Eastern time."
12876.0,Patient,yeah so the 16th at four o'clock.
408.0,Provider,"Yes, and, for some reason you're called into work, or whatever just go to the virtual clinic and make sure you cancel that appointment there'll be no penalty, you can cancel right up to the time of the appointment okay. Okay, all right, Sir good work."
12876.0,Patient,"All right, thank you."
408.0,Provider,bye bye.
