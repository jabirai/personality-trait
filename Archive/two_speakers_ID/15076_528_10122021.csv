15076.0,Patient,hi.
528.0,Provider,I apologize for being a few minutes late.
15076.0,Patient,Oh that's okay don't worry about it.
528.0,Provider,Are you doing.
15076.0,Patient,"i'm doing Okay, how are you."
528.0,Provider,Very good.
15076.0,Patient,how's it been a busy day.
528.0,Provider,yeah.
15076.0,Patient,Do you have a day usually.
528.0,Provider,"um I try to keep it around five or not. yeah. But some days it gets a little bit more it's just it's too much you know, like."
15076.0,Patient,I would imagine you're mentally exhausted after that many hours yeah.
528.0,Provider,yeah exactly so I found that four to five is probably my best number but yeah.
15076.0,Patient,yeah.
528.0,Provider,"yeah so um I want to just check in with you, first, you know if you've had any thoughts, since we talked last time and just I don't know, I just want to see where you're at with everything."
15076.0,Patient,"yeah a couple of developments. Are that I got my I had full blood work done. Okay, because I had a physical a couple weeks ago and I, I asked the question that i'm sure every middle aged woman asked, I was like something wrong with my thyroid. And nothing's wrong with my thyroid. So that came back normal. My cholesterol is a bit hi i'm just that's what the piece of information that I thought you should know, it was the the. hdl is the bad cholesterol right."
528.0,Provider,No good.
15076.0,Patient,"that's the good okay. Oh now i'm wondering anyway, it was like 224 or something like that so in high cholesterol runs in my family so. I definitely want to like kind of keep an eye on that. But everything else came back normal, so I don't have a Hypo i'm not hyperthyroid. And, and then the other development. pertains to my family my kids had their physicals last week. Okay, the doctor pulled me aside and said regarding my daughter, she said, you know she said just bring the food in a little bit she's like she just she didn't. I was very grateful, she didn't say anything in front of my daughter oh me aside and talk really quietly and she said, you know don't put her on a diet just sort of gradually try and reduce the amount of food you guys are eating. And that totally plays into my. Whole like I feel like. I feel a lot of anxiety over my kids you know gaining weight being overweight and and i'm not sure how to handle that so. That was just something that and I think that might have triggered I definitely like yesterday was a total binge day for me. And I was trying to like pinpoint why."
528.0,Provider,"Okay, good."
15076.0,Patient,"I was interestingly, I woke up yesterday I don't usually feel hungry when I wake up, but I woke up yesterday feeling hungry for sugar like I. And my binge as normal was sugar, it was like you know to caramel apples and which is like a horrible breakfast i'm to cheryl apples, it was well, I wrote down what aid um. Oh, I got a bag of and went to target and I got a big bag of the mini hundred grand candy bars and just. Polish that whole thing off. And it was all chocolate and. candy. And then later in the day, it was like I was making my kids. lunches for the next day and I took a big spoonful of peanut butter and jelly to eat, you know it's just there wasn't no thought going into what was going in my body."
528.0,Provider,yeah.
15076.0,Patient,"And then, at the end of the day I just you know, there was a lot of self loathing. and wondering why like I just feel out of control in those situations like I can't control what i'm doing and what i'm putting in."
528.0,Provider,"I wonder if, can you kind of think about like when you woke up, you said you were hungry. Sugar like can you describe to me like what how did you know that exactly."
15076.0,Patient,"i'm. Part of I was very fixated on this caramel apple idea because I had tried to get one, the day before I love them and I every fall I try to eat one or two or three and. I hadn't been able, they were sold out of the store, the day before and I needed to stop at the. store after I dropped the kids off at school yesterday. And I was just craving something sweet and a caramel apple sounded so good to me so i'm like okay i'll have that and it did feel very satisfying you know. It wasn't like I was eating it and saying oh this doesn't taste very good. yeah whereas today I woke up and I don't feel hungry today, you know, maybe that's because I loaded my body with so much food yesterday. But there was definitely a hunger component yesterday. But clearly, once I started I wasn't able to put the brakes on you know."
528.0,Provider,"So, again I want to just kind of see if, and then you may not know this right now, which is. Well, but I just wonder if, like if you did you was it more like a taste, hunger, that you were kind of that made you feel like it was hunger. yeah like okay."
15076.0,Patient,"yeah it was more of a taste, hunger, like, I was specifically craving something. yeah yeah. Okay Jason every day for me, but it was just something I noticed."
528.0,Provider,mm hmm.
15076.0,Patient,yeah this morning I didn't really feel hungry I haven't really I like a handful of granola and that's about it i've had coffee. But. it's kind of interesting that you know some days I don't crave and some days I do.
528.0,Provider,"Okay. And so, then it just kind of put sounds like it just kind of continued throughout the day, do you eat any like meal at all during the day, or is it mostly just kind of grazing on sugary things."
15076.0,Patient,"It was mostly grazing on sugary things at dinner, I had a great symbol from daily harvest. which was completely unsatisfying my husband's out of town for the week and so we're doing you know quicker meals, so I had the you know the kids had. hot dogs and fruit for dinner last night, which is not something we normally would eat, but you know, since the four of us aren't here i'm kind of short cutting it but. I had the daily the daily harvest and it just was not satisfying it all, it was just you know sort of like well I feel like i'm eating this because I should and I didn't finish it, but then I followed up with two bowls of kettle corn, you know so. I do think one of my issues right now with eating healthy is it's Labor intensive and i'm a little bit burned out on the Labor part of cooking. it's much easier to buy and more satisfying in the short term to buy a bag of little candy bars and."
528.0,Provider,Yes.
15076.0,Patient,You know and eat that.
528.0,Provider,"yeah so you want something that's like you know, easy to prepare preparation kind of thing like convenient kind of things."
15076.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
528.0,Provider,Before okay. dude were you ever into cooking or did you ever like you know.
15076.0,Patient,"I wonder, oh I it's one of those things I kind of. I do it a lot for the family. it's not something I love to bake, of course, because, again I just I feel like my Achilles heel is sweets and I love to bake as does my daughter and it's funny we have this my husband and I had this discussion this week. So my daughter, who who's 12 and have a daughter, and a son and my daughter is 12 and she's the one who the pediatrician pulled me aside and said, you know gotta rein it in a little bit. She is obsessed with baking it's like her thing she's really good at it, I mean she's just she's kind of gifted at it and she knows that when she grows up she wants to she wants to go to college, she was at a business school and she wants to. start a bakery. so great."
528.0,Provider,yeah.
15076.0,Patient,"And then my husband and I are like looking at her friend who's really skinny and we're like you know I mean we're obviously saying this, when my daughter wasn't around like if she were really skinny like her friend we wouldn't think twice about like we'd be like oh my."
528.0,Provider,God that's.
15076.0,Patient,"Great but, and we encourage her like okay that's so fantastic that you have that plan and that's such a great idea and you're such a good baker but inside panicking because we're like."
528.0,Provider,Oh.
15076.0,Patient,"My God she's setting herself up for a lifetime of obesity, because. That would be her job is baking you know but that's not necessarily true obviously but it's our fear. We talked a lot about that this week. yeah so."
528.0,Provider,glad you don't talk about it in front of her.
15076.0,Patient,"No, no we're super super like. Maybe overly the other direction, like we never talked about way we never. Like and maybe we're we've gone too far in the other direction, you know I don't know but um yeah we just were trying so hard to not get them hung up on food, but I think I think they saw."
528.0,Provider,"ya know I I would have to say that I think less is more kind of like you know and and things we'll talk about, to which I know you said last week you kind of want to learn some tools that you can actually you know use with your kids to or maybe. My kids but in terms of like intuitive eating, you know that is something that I think could be some a way to talk about food or a way to talk about your body in a way that's doesn't. What do I want to say that doesn't you know, bring up the the fears around food or the the. Like restriction kind of mindset, or like the diet diet kind of mindset kind of. It comes from a different kind of place, so in that sense that could be a helpful thing that you could eventually talk to your kids about as well."
15076.0,Patient,As the whole the whole concept of intuitive eating.
528.0,Provider,"yeah yeah sure, and will, I will definitely but like. You know and that's what I want to work with you more on to is just the you know. sort of listening to your body, you know because, like, I mean just as an example with your daughter like if she were to like be become a baker and open a prone bakery and and it doesn't mean she's gonna like be obese or in quote unquote obese. For the rest of her life, you know if she has full permission to eat all foods. And does it, because if she if she feels like that food is. Like off limits or that she's bad it'll actually drive her to probably eat more of it. out if you know that, like she can have it and she's also listening to her body. that's the part that that's the key part is listening, knowing that you can have all foods, but also listening to your body, because chances are, and this is the same thing for you, I would say chances are if you're listening to your body, you know. and truly listen and again, maybe I don't think you're here quite yet, but eventually you get to the point where like eating sugar all day is not going to feel good for you."
15076.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
528.0,Provider,"Well, you I think right now you're seems like you're coming from a place of i'm not sure yet i'm just getting to know you, but like you know it could be that you're coming from a place of like. You know, like this is off limits, so now that this is, you know now that i'm just like you know I had one caramel apple right then i'll just eat more and then i'll just keep. On. fire and it's just like you know it goes from that restrictive, you know I don't remember if we talked too much about this last week but. Like sort of the restrictions cycles, we talked about that."
15076.0,Patient,"No good i'm i'm familiar with it. Okay, personally, because that's kind of what i've done I tend to be someone who's all or nothing. And so i'm either eating all healthy food or i'm eating all not healthy healthy and I know. i'm trying to move away from putting values on food, but you know food that's nourishing all day or food that's not nourishing all day I tend to do one extreme or the other. I um so that's like one of my challenges is to get comfortable with being in the middle."
528.0,Provider,"Yes, yes, so I love to like talk about this, you know, so the idea of the restrictions cycle is like if you're well, one of the ways I like to talk about this is like using the analogy of. Like a pendulum right so like you know the pendulum swings like the US right, so if you're. If you're holding the pendulum let's say to one side, this would be like that, when you're trying to eat all healthy and you're kind of like restricting food right, so this is the restriction side as soon as you let go of your pendulum right, where does that automatically go."
15076.0,Patient,yeah because the extreme opposite.
528.0,Provider,"side is you know. Quote unquote unhealthy might be unhealthy foods and much you know that type of thing so um you know, whenever you know people are in the binge cycle. it's not usually, even though the binge might be distressing play the restriction that's causing the problem. Is that you're restricting down. avenge right. Because yeah not restrict if you were to just let that pendulum just sling and not like restrict."
15076.0,Patient,mm hmm.
528.0,Provider,it's kind of like hanging in the middle right like. yeah and that's what you're talking about is like just moderation and just eating kind of like not all or nothing right.
15076.0,Patient,"yeah and I definitely get into the mindset, I did this yesterday, where I was like well, I have this certain amount of. dessert in the House and, again, this is all hidden from the kids like they have no idea i'm telling them like you know no dessert tonight and i'm eating it all behind their backs. I was like well you know i've gone shopping for the week I don't want to go back to the grocery store So if I just eat all this stuff and get it out of the House I won't have to think about it, the rest of the week, which is a very common thing for me to do and. Okay ways never ends well obviously you know, like it just gets me to you know eat it all now, instead of parsing it out over the week. So yeah that that was sort of one of my where I was coming from yesterday."
528.0,Provider,"Okay, so you had all this food in the House that you'd bought, with the intention of like kind of having it throughout the week. and And it just was you felt like this urge to like just get it all in like in one one day kind of."
15076.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
528.0,Provider,"mm hmm. yeah yeah yeah and um and I know that, so I know that sugar and sweets, are one of those foods you feel kind of bad about yourself, when you eat and you know, obviously there's some level of there's like a restriction happening with that food, you know with sugar. You know, so one of the things we can talk about today, I mean I kind of want to hear what maybe if there's something specific you want to talk about, but I think what can be helpful, is helping you to establish a regular eating pattern. You know I think you know we can talk, we can include sugar or not like, depending on how comfortable you feel but. i'm like I think that's a good step it, you know, in terms of helping to regulate your eating if you're waking up, and you know just some using yesterday as your example like, and you know, the first thing that you need is like like a candy apple or whatever caramel apple is like. Well, we know that's I mean already you're kind of setting yourself up for the rest of the day, because that's already with those triggering for you so maybe working on like having more balanced kind of meals regular kind of food. And i'm not saying you can't have. That food, but but starting to incorporate more regular meals, I think, would be like sort of a good step to go to what are your thoughts."
15076.0,Patient,"I totally agree, I think, because i've i've gotten I think I mentioned before, I was in this habit of. intermittent fasting and then I think that started to feel really restrictive and I wasn't seeing results, really. yeah um so I was in a pattern of not eating breakfast or lunch, and then I transition to just sort of snacking all day instead of you know, sitting down and eating actual meals. So ya know I think that's a really good idea i'm super curious about your thoughts on. Sugar because, like I said I do feel like that's my thing that I tend that I all I mean I don't think i've been judged on anything other than that. And I do feel like a chemical reaction in my body when I feel like whatever it is serotonin or oxytocin or what I don't know what it is. what's that."
528.0,Provider,it's dope a man welcome serotonin to yeah yeah.
15076.0,Patient,"So a part of me, and I have in the past sort of given up sugar in the attempt to sort of regulate my eating, and it also in some ways it's. In some ways it's easier, because then there's not that debate going on in my head of like should I have something I should not have some today how much did I have when should I have it, what should I have. If I am not eating sugar that's just taken out of the equation."
528.0,Provider,yeah the.
15076.0,Patient,"time it also feels like i'm kind of being deprived. yeah so i'm curious what your thoughts are on that, if you would recommend cutting it out or. keeping it in or."
528.0,Provider,"yeah that's a really good question and i'll be honest, I don't think there's a there's a right or wrong answer, I think it really depends, I mean, I would say so, generally speaking, a having sugar in your diet is totally okay. right that is truly what I think. So I don't ever think that it's something you have to eliminate and because of the exact reason. Exact thing you just said, like you're gonna you're depriving yourself of something that you like, and then. You know, and then what's going to end up happening is you're going to like like we said the restrict bench like you strict it and then you overdo it, so one of the ways that like we could talk about doing this and, again, this is just an idea is like setting up some regular meals. Then include. Like some of your favorite sugary foods. So that way it's part of me you don't feel like you, I mean, in fact, if you wanted to do it like breakfast lunch and dinner or whatever, every time you ate. I think that we could we could try that out, you know I mean there's no harm in that, because if you think about it you're going to like by restricting it, you probably end up eating more than you would anyway, if you just gave yourself permission."
15076.0,Patient,"yeah. Do you do I agree, and I also think that if I were eating nutrients, you know if I were sitting down and having a meal, it would eliminate some of the hunger, you know that I think often will trigger. Yes, the craving is because i'm my body needs some nourishment and isn't getting it and I reached for the easiest thing which is sugar so yeah."
528.0,Provider,"and also a lot, I mean I think just kind of along that same line is that, like you know if you're not eating properly kind of like a regular consistent meals. I mean that's how your body functions is through the the energy provided and food, and so, if you're like meals, or like a regular or you don't or you're skipping or it's not enough. Your body's going to find a way to get what it needs, just to keep you alive, and so, for I mean sugar is the most The easiest way to get energy and your body actually knows that, and you know your brain kind of knows that. that's part of what could be sort of like reason why you're going for sugar is because you just like your body knows that that's going to give you quick energy. As. Well, for like broccoli or something because, like that's not going to give you enough quick energy, you know it's just way easier to go for like something super sugary."
15076.0,Patient,Right yeah that totally makes sense yeah. Do you recommend so when you have people eating regularly do you recommend eating if you're not hungry to get that pattern going or or do you recommend like skipping that meal or delaying that meal.
528.0,Provider,"yeah that's that's another good question I would say, never skip a meal, I mean I don't mean to be so black and white, but really there's very few times that I think skipping a meal is a good thing. Even if you ate so much the day before let's say you have this like yesterday, like. yeah it's you know a lot of food yesterday and you weren't really hungry today, I would still say you should have breakfast. Okay, because then you're just setting yourself up for the same cycle again right it's like okay i'm going to skip breakfast and then like you just continue the same pattern. Yes, some point, you have to just break that right, and so. Especially right now, like later on, you might actually like most people's bodies sort of adapt to regular eating, even if you never did that did that, before like you're kind of training, your body start eating normally. And so it was so like later on your body might actually be hungry. At that time, but for right now until because you're eating is so sort of chaotic right now why he doesn't even know how to plan. For anything so. yeah so part of this process is. is like to help you to build trust in your body, but at the same time, your body needs to trust you. Go that you're going to. write like you're gonna you're gonna feed it regularly and that like it knows, because most human bodies work best with like consistency like it kind of like you know babies, you know baby. You know that type of thing so um the more consistent, you can be with your eating the better your body is going to function like because it's like it knows that in like. Three or four hours you're gonna feed it again it's not going to be kind of wondering like okay I don't know when my next meal might be, you know. is able to actually like keep your metabolism going smoothly, because it's predictable."
15076.0,Patient,"yeah yeah no that totally makes sense yeah i'm. Just a side note to. I don't think i've mentioned this before I have been for the last few months, eating mostly gluten and dairy free not for weight loss. But because. I have PCs and. i've been reading up on it and that's recommended almost always when i'm all the literature meeting and I noticed, I feel better when i'm not eating gluten and dairy. But I obviously i'm not letting that keep me from. Eating you know junk food. So is that. Something that you're okay with. During this plant, you know, during this plan of eating three meals, a day or."
528.0,Provider,"I would say sorry I didn't mean to interrupt. Okay um I would say, so I I actually I don't think that eliminating gluten and dairy is. You know, normally part of the PC ios like. yeah thing if that makes sense."
15076.0,Patient,"yeah more of a natural path like I don't think doctors tell you to do that it's more of a yo. yo there have been some studies done on it, but. yeah exactly I don't."
528.0,Provider,"Like there's not a strong enough evidence to say, like everybody with PC Oh, I should like eliminate gluten and dairy."
15076.0,Patient,Like yeah.
528.0,Provider,"So with That said, I mean if you truly feel like it makes you feel better like I don't want to dismiss like the way you know your own experience, of course. right on, so I would say to get started, I mean again we. like this is just my initial thought, but we could try to keep you kind of dairy free and gluten free if that feels better and then maybe sort of test it out, you know."
15076.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
528.0,Provider,"Reading some of those back in. yeah and see if that you know kind of what what the difference is right now I feel like again we won't really know what's helping like if we start doing regular meals like maybe you're not feeling good, because not eating regular. foods. yeah."
15076.0,Patient,"And if you really recommend you know not making anything off limits i'm totally open to that too, like I said, my blood work came back all normal other than cholesterol and I do feel like I think. Reducing dairy at least I think helps lower cholesterol bit, but um. yeah i'm fine just saying i'll eat anything to start with, and then maybe. experiment with gluten and dairy. Of I see me ready i'm at a point where i'm like. Whatever you want me to do i'm going to do. i'm just so tired of being in my head and and. You know, trying to figure out trying to make way too many decisions about food so."
528.0,Provider,"Wait so you're saying you'd be okay with including dairy and gluten for now and then maybe. yeah and figuring it out later on, like. yeah yeah that works, I mean because, like even if you, because if you hadn't told me that you were doing that I would have said just have it anyway, like."
15076.0,Patient,yeah.
528.0,Provider,"it's not usually part of like I said it's for most people I don't with PCs it's not easily a typical recommendation I make so um. Yes, that's good yeah so I mean the more the more foods, you can allow like you feel comfortable allowing i'd say the better um and, as I said, with the sugar like I it sounds like by not allowing sugar, I think that would only just cause more problems for you."
15076.0,Patient,"Okay yeah right, I agree."
528.0,Provider,"So maybe we can just incorporate it into your meals. You know, whatever it is like, if you want to have a chocolate bar Okay, you can have a chocolate bar with your meal, but you're going to also have these other things too."
15076.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
528.0,Provider,Does that sound like kind of doable for you or.
15076.0,Patient,"yeah it definitely does um. Do you have I mean at this point in the process, do you have people do the whole like half your plate is fruits and vegetables and a quarter of your plate is i'm not sure what your ratio would be but. You know, do you advise people to do that to sort of break down what they're eating."
528.0,Provider,yeah so I can actually show you hold on my dog just wants to go out.
15076.0,Patient,There yeah. My dog is. Very scared today because it's windy so she's pulled up on top of my feet under here.
528.0,Provider,"um let me show you the plate that I liked or the guy that I like to use. This again. Okay i'm going to share this and then I can of course on this to. Oh awesome yeah but I like to use this plate. As the guy and he probably seen similar kind of things. And I wouldn't say it has to be so precise like I think i'm more concerned about Okay, you have some starch or green on your plate, you have some fruit or vegetable, I mean the idea is by the way this is supposed to be like a nine inch dinner plate. And you have to kind of fill most of that if you can see. there's a third of its grains and starches and some fruits or vegetables some protein and then. Like your fat might not be on the side but it might be mixed in, like let's say you use oil and cooking, you know as. or whatever, or you have salad dressing on, you know that would be your out of fats and then. You know, dairy and then the thing that I would also add here, which I always get frustrated that it's not on this plane, but is like I would add what I call like some people call it play foods, some people call it fun foods."
15076.0,Patient,yeah.
528.0,Provider,"You just fade sugary foods, whatever you want to call. yeah things like that that type of thing that doesn't like fall into one of these categories, but."
15076.0,Patient,mm hmm.
528.0,Provider,So we could also have that as like a side. What do you think.
15076.0,Patient,I think that sounds really good I i'm i'm wondering if you do you typically. Give suggested meals like do you have lists of that or.
528.0,Provider,"yeah or we could go what I like to do is rather than me say this is what you should eat like like we, and we have time we can kind of go through this and just come up with some ideas for you, based on like what you like. So let me just i'm going to stop sharing, so you kind of get the idea of like all the food groups right on the plate."
15076.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
528.0,Provider,"And then, as far as like do you have a clear understanding of like what actual foods like what is a starch what is an fruit and vegetable should be pretty clear, but like what's protein what's you know fat like do you do kind of know or do you need."
15076.0,Patient,yeah yeah just and all the reading i've done about food and nutrition and yeah I i've definitely flirted with orthorexia. Okay okay yeah I feel like i'm kind of familiar with the groups yeah.
528.0,Provider,"Okay um so i'm just going to stop sharing this for a second i'm. just see. yeah so maybe we can talk about actually going on, maybe come up with a, let me just sorry i'm going to like maybe do a new document here, no i'm. Once again. Okay. So i'm going to share this and then we can kind of like."
15076.0,Patient,Oh perfect.
528.0,Provider,"Okay, so this is just i'm sorry I wanna. Okay, so i'm. Just to kind of give I mean it's the same kind of format, in the sense of like there's a grain of fruit or maybe a protein or dairy there's."
15076.0,Patient,fad.
528.0,Provider,"same thing we just looked at it's just broken up differently so um I mean, these are just examples, but we can kind of like I said, come up with your own examples. So, like you know well let's let's first talk about like well anyways you can see here it's like two grains or fruit and milk or protein and fat. So, like what. What kind of breakfast things do you generally like."
15076.0,Patient,um I love yogurt and. Fruit and granola that's one of my favorite. um I which I guess that would cover. All the categories based mostly.
528.0,Provider,yeah so.
15076.0,Patient,Full fat usually a full fat yogurt.
528.0,Provider,"Okay, good."
15076.0,Patient,Greek Greek yogurt yeah. yeah that's the only favorites um I do love eggs. And toast and avocado you know I love that kind of our breakfast.
528.0,Provider,"yeah so this would be like you could do so, the two grains just so you know it'd be like one slice of bread is one green like one right exchange. for things like like you can see here for the oatmeal it's about like half a cup is like one grain. Okay whole grain is you know our whole serving of oatmeal is like or two, I should say two is one cup. Now, I also want to point out that this would be what I would consider a minimum of what you need. Okay, because i'm I don't want you to feel like you can have more like that's a really important part of this. I don't want you to feel like this is the most This is all I can have like because that's spiral you into like that restrictive mode okay. yeah kind of giving you a framework, but I would say, definitely keep in mind that this is the minimum so. You don't want to eat much less than us, because that will hit that you know that's going to affect your. that's gonna affect your body, you need a certain a certain baseline amount of energy, just to function right not so, I just wanted to make that super clear that, like a So if you do the, let me just go back here for the Greek yogurt so this would be like roughly a cup. And then it would be you know, maybe roughly a cup of fruit. yeah and then like also a cup of granola. Then I think if you do that. That would cover everything right there that we just like that covers all the groups."
15076.0,Patient,"Okay okay um yeah I know that sounds that sounds doable. And i'm and i'm wondering. Actually, another thing I really like is a smoothie. Okay um. And i'm assuming you can you can fit all of that into smoothie except for the Green part, although I people put grains on top of smoothies sometimes right."
528.0,Provider,yeah that's true.
15076.0,Patient,"Or you can put a piece of toast with it, I usually if I have that for breakfast it's usually just the smoothie. And not anything else."
528.0,Provider,"Oh, that what do you put in your smoothie."
15076.0,Patient,"i'm usually. Basically, fruit and Greek yogurt and flaxseed. Okay um or like I said I really like the daily harvest smoothies so those usually have a fat and a vegetable and fruit. In them."
528.0,Provider,"Okay, so it sounds like it covers everything like you just said, except for the grain. yeah, so I will try, I will try, having like something on the side. I feel like i've also heard of people I can't say that i've tried this myself, but I i've heard of people putting like oatmeal and there's movie."
15076.0,Patient,Oh yeah yeah like they have a bowl they put it in a bowl kind of yeah.
528.0,Provider,"yeah exactly like a smoothie ball you're right. So that could be an option to, but if you don't like that then maybe just having like some toast. or like even a half of a bagel you know."
15076.0,Patient,yeah.
528.0,Provider,"It all you know, like you could do it. like that."
15076.0,Patient,Oh yeah.
528.0,Provider,What would you tend to go for do you think if you.
15076.0,Patient,The smoothie or the yogurt and fruit. Although in as it gets colder I do like. To make oatmeal sometimes I make like a big batch in the slow cooker and then. We have it for the week. So yeah I and then and i'm sure this comes up with people that you work with but it's so funny i'm looking at this and i'm like because i've been so. brainwashed.
528.0,Provider,mm hmm.
15076.0,Patient,"i'm looking at it i'm like oh my God that's a lot of carbs. And it's not too many carbs and I know that that's because, which is also funny because yesterday I ate nothing but sugar like it's really It makes no sense that my brain goes there but i'm. i'm assuming that's a pretty common response like people get kind of scared like it kind of scares me that. there's a cup of granola there versus a quarter Cup, and I think for me part of that is also tied into my son. Who has type one diabetes and his blood sugar is better regulated when we keep it on the lower side, even though we don't have him on a low carb diet, but we do try to keep his carbs lower. But is that, like a common response of people."
528.0,Provider,"Totally. yeah either that or it's like wow that looks like so much food, you know that's also on the game because."
15076.0,Patient,"You become so accustomed to like weight watchers or you know, whatever the diet does your is like I remember being on weight watchers and the amount of food you're allowed to eat is so small it's like. I think it's calculated it's like 1200 calories a day."
528.0,Provider,Oh wow.
15076.0,Patient,"And then that becomes like quote unquote normal. Exactly and then, if I see something that's more than 1200 calories a day I see it, i'm like oh my God i'm going to gain weight."
528.0,Provider,Right yeah.
15076.0,Patient,um but I totally believe that eating like this is sort of part of the process of. healing my brain is.
528.0,Provider,"Actually, so true and I think that's awesome that you are able to even recognize that, like. To be able to you know, first of all notice that fear that's coming up or that you know, and I noticed that, like that your brain has been. You know where it's coming from like is your brain has kind of been brainwashed you've just been and that's why a lot of this is on learning, you know. i'm starting to N, and I want to also say that if you don't feel totally comfortable you know, sometimes we kind of break this down into smaller bites for people if it feels overwhelming. yeah i'm kind of showing this to you like, just so you know that, like what a normal person eats like this. Like actually what you need it doesn't mean you have to do this tomorrow right like maybe we need to kind of do like kind of baby steps till we get to this point, those kind of safer for you i'm okay with that. yeah you know yeah just let me know like."
15076.0,Patient,"yeah I think I think baby steps do you feel safer, do you recommend maybe just starting with breakfast and then."
528.0,Provider,yeah well.
15076.0,Patient,"good idea yeah. So if I think. you're right, it is a little overwhelming i'm also thinking of my family, and I know we haven't gotten here yet, but do you Is this something that you think I should extend to the whole family. Because my kids right now we're in a you know they have they have a smoothie for breakfast pretty much every day and that's because that's easy and quick and they are okay with it picky. they're having a sandwich every day at lunch. Is this something that you think I should extend like to my husband who's also going through this program. yeah and to the kids just have everyone gradually get on board with us."
528.0,Provider,yeah totally I mean because there's nothing unusual about this.
15076.0,Patient,"No, no."
528.0,Provider,"You know we're just we're just talking about balanced meals on a site. yeah and and really that applies to I mean I can't really think of one person that this doesn't apply to I mean again. Babies or whatever, and then, when you when you've you know because, even in my experience i've worked with a lot of people with diabetes and. Even people with diabetes can eat this way, but it doesn't but sometimes you have to tell her it depending on the person's blood sugar. yeah I say that, like it could totally work for everybody um you know, there might be some minor modifications, but like, because the truth is like what we're seeing here is we're seeing like carbohydrates, are presented at each meal. At each meal facet each meal Those are the three macronutrients that our body needs and it's just evenly distributed throughout the day. yeah and the other part of this, to which you may start to notice is when you eat balanced meals, it really can help I mean not only meet your nutritional needs, but also just it can help sustain your energy. You know, like less you have less of. Less cravings, for you know sugary things because your energy level is like kept even right so once we, I think, and the reason why i'm starting with this as like. A first step for you to is because, once you do this for a period of time, I mean it could be weeks or months or you know, whatever it could just a week is going to solve. Right might start to notice some differences but. Then we can kind of get to the root of like, why do you keep craving sugar or why is sugar your bench food. But without kind of like almost calibrating your body."
15076.0,Patient,yeah.
528.0,Provider,"Like, we have to make ensure that your body is being fed like like properly. yeah for us to like understand. Like why the drive for sugar right like if it's just logical like then maybe a lot of that those cravings will you know will might decrease because of just regular eating."
15076.0,Patient,But if.
528.0,Provider,"even extends beyond that which is not not unusual you know we can then explore Okay, well, we know you're getting enough food like and regular food so it's it's it's not necessarily biological, but it could let's let's see what else might be going on, you know."
15076.0,Patient,"yeah for sure that makes sense. And in terms of i'm going to ask another family question in terms of. Having. fun food in the House. My tactic has always been, for the most part don't have it in the House, and then on the weekends, the kids have desserts, but I do think that has made them more obsessed with fun foods. Do you recommend just having that stuff in the House at all times and letting them have fun food every day, instead of you know just on the weekend, I mean clearly they're both on the heavier side so whatever i'm doing is not. Either you know either genetically those cards are stacked against them, which I think they kind of are but i'm. i'm just curious what your take is on that."
528.0,Provider,"yeah I mean without knowing so my, the first thing that comes to mind is like I don't know anything about their eating habits. So just because they they are in a larger body doesn't mean it really doesn't tell me anything. To. You about how they eat yeah so it's hard for me to say, I again just like i'm saying to you, I think the more accessible and like and. Like I do think that it could be problematic to just say Oh, you can only have it on the weekend, because we're putting boundaries on something so of course they're going to overeat it on the weekends, because. Like Oh, we get to eat it, you know so now we'll just overeat right. Right right. What restrictive mentality, so I think I mean my my yeah like I would do this for you to like I would say, you know if you're going to give yourself permission to eat, you should be there should be no limits. Not like only have one cookie you know, like. And this is, and this is the part that takes a lot of time to have trust in your body and like using a tune men like to have like sort of intuitive eating. Listen, you know, and I mean this could be a family practice where you all kind of like check in together like Okay, when you know, like How does your has your stomach feel like do you do you want to have more ice cream, or are you good like. yeah you have to choose, you know that's part of it, too, and that's that's what I want to encourage you to do to again i'm not saying you have to be there, right now, but is to really start to trust your body like to be like Okay, I can have like a whole pint of ice cream if I want. yeah but like Do I really wanted to write like do I actually need it like you can actually once you give yourself permission to eat all food, you have space in your head it's like actually think about like does that. yeah really, really, what I want you know. yeah or am I just like eating this do I want this whole kind of ice cream, in response to the fact that I may never get it again, or you know where it is like."
15076.0,Patient,That totally makes sense yeah.
528.0,Provider,So yeah okay so um I don't have to answer your question.
15076.0,Patient,"yeah yeah no I think on our poor kids because we've gone back and forth with them, we will will sit them down and say okay well. You know the doctor was saying, we need to just make sure we eat healthy and so that our bodies are strong and and so we're going to just have desserts on the weekends they're so used to us sitting them down and saying we're going to try this new technique. Right, so I i'm thinking. To do what you're saying, but maybe i'll just not even talk about it."
528.0,Provider,"We may you know, like I don't know if they know you're like in this program or if they know anything but. You could say like I am i'm like trying to change my relationship with food, and this is what i'm learning is like best for for for me and for all of us so we're not going to just limit. You know, sweets, to the weekend, like we're gonna and don't be surprised if they like oh okay like and they want to eat all of it like."
15076.0,Patient,yeah that makes sense yeah.
528.0,Provider,"You know, but then over time and we'll we'll probably talk more about this, but there's something called habituation if you're reading the book The intuitive eating book they talk about it in there. But it's basically the idea that, like. When you have something over and over again, like the excitement sort of dies down, you know what I mean like. Give yourself the same breakfast every morning you're like Okay, like, I mean some people generally like to eat the same thing, but like it doesn't have that much the same excitement or power over you because you're just do it every day. yeah so it's it's that kind of idea that like oh yeah I get to eat sweets all the time, so now, they will do it like an abundance, but then over time. That actually can decrease because they know like okay I just had you know I just had this yesterday, I can have it tomorrow, I can have it, the next day I don't need all right now so there's that kind of letting go of that restriction mentality."
15076.0,Patient,yeah yeah no that's it that's a good point that it would take time. yeah just be patient yeah. Okay.
528.0,Provider,"Okay, well, we have to stop. So. Do you want, what would it what kind of stands out to you or what would you like to kind of focus on for this week."
15076.0,Patient,"I think I think i'd like to focus on breakfast. For me and for my kids because, like I said they're having like the same thing, every day, and I think it'd be good to mix it up. And then, make it a balanced breakfast and then. just focus on that maybe. For yeah and then also just. Allowing more things into the House and not making them off limits."
528.0,Provider,"that's great um. Okay yeah that's that's awesome Okay, I think that's really good and then we'll like I said we'll build on. You know let's. See how you do with breakfast this week, you know we how that goes, and then you know if you're ready for next week, we can work on another meal or snack. Again with the idea that we want to work towards three meals and maybe you know, two to three snacks depending on you know what you need."
15076.0,Patient,Okay okay.
528.0,Provider,"All right, and then. You were saying that were you logging something you said something like I wrote down what I ate."
15076.0,Patient,"Yesterday, just partly because I was, I was like I couldn't believe what I was eating I was like oh my God yeah. Okay got written down is crazy."
528.0,Provider,"To you, because I have a really great APP that most of my clients use. If you want to actually log in there."
15076.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
528.0,Provider,"And there's also other tools, I mean you can just use it strictly for logging food, but there's also like you know, sometimes they ask we ask questions around like. Your urges to binge or like how you're feeling or how like what you're thinking like a lot of other kind of things to you know consider."
15076.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
528.0,Provider,"So it's called and i'll send you an email cuz i'm going to send you a picture of that plate and i'll send you this like meal plan thing that we just looked at. But i'll the name of the APP is called recovery record. Okay, and and then i'll send you my link code, because what what we can do is actually you just there's there's a place once you sign up, it says, I connect clinician and then I can actually just view your logs."
15076.0,Patient,got it okay.
528.0,Provider,Great.
15076.0,Patient,that's great that is crazy.
528.0,Provider,"yeah yeah. Okay, so and then for next week um did we already set something up and I can't."
15076.0,Patient,"Remember, no, we didn't."
528.0,Provider,Wait yeah I do have you down.
15076.0,Patient,"Oh, you do."
528.0,Provider,"Or maybe I just put you down automatic, I think we might have yeah cuz it."
15076.0,Patient,Just automatic for this. time slot every week.
528.0,Provider,That does that work for you.
15076.0,Patient,yeah that totally works.
528.0,Provider,Okay. Well yeah I didn't even realize I did that okay. um so one o'clock on Tuesday of next week. Perfect yeah okay.
15076.0,Patient,"Great well Thank you so much, I really appreciate it, and thanks for sending me that stuff that'll help a ton and. Then we'll check in next week."
528.0,Provider,Perfect sounds good alright have a good rest of your day.
15076.0,Patient,Thanks so much rhonda. saying goodbye.
