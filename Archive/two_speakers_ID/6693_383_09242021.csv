6693.0,Patient,A big deal. yeah.
383.0,Provider,How have you been I know that you mentioned yesterday that you were feeling you're really having a lot of stress related to the pressure you're putting on yourself.
6693.0,Patient,"yeah that's a constant battle um yeah but i'm like over performing, which is good at work like they're telling me i'm doing amazing and I mentioned that I got promoted and all that and they're raised that came with that too, so that was nice. So yeah but just I guess putting a lot of pressure I was, I was more pressure last week, because I have that interview which I failed. Because it was really hard hard anyways so but that's fine I didn't really feel too bad because you know got the promotion, the week after anyways so I thought. No time. But yeah, I guess, a lot of that a lot of the pressure was from that I was just like it was the worst ever follow it goes making myself sick with worry with anxiety. With the pressure. And I and it just it reflected on the interview, like everything I was just trying to learn everything all at once cram it in and everything came out horrible."
383.0,Provider,"So, like."
6693.0,Patient,You know. I would have been better off not even studying at all. And just going with what I had instead of trying to be a superstar. yeah so I learned that. And now you know I know now next time you know it doesn't matter I haven't actually an interview with Google coming up next week i'm. And i'm not I told myself already you know I already know everything that I need like nothing's gonna help me that nothing I can cram within a week is gonna you know. make my changes to the result so just going to go in and give it my best shot and not be stressed how this time so yeah.
383.0,Provider,yeah yeah so you learn something from this experience.
6693.0,Patient,"yeah it was bad like I felt physically sick. During the interview like and before like I was in the bathroom I felt like I had to throw up, it was not good."
383.0,Provider,"Oh no yeah yeah well um. You been putting yourself you've been putting yourself under considerable pressure, just to get through school. Then, to go job now you know, let me go and apply for this other job. So you want to just like after this Google interview I don't know it's it's just a suggestion that you just kind of like just be with your promotion and your race and kind of like let yourself."
6693.0,Patient,"yeah no i'm happy where i'm at now I wasn't happy before, but it was considerable my new promotion so. So i'm happy now basically that's why I was still applying is because I. felt like I was. Under you know paid or whatever. But now it's fine and i'm just gonna you know relax for a while and now no more, no more applying nothing like that so yeah. Just enjoy it. yeah. So."
383.0,Provider,"Well, you seem like you're doing a little better to Dan and if it's because it's Friday and here."
6693.0,Patient,"yeah that's a part of it and and just like a lot less stress, now that i've learned that my God, you know, been working out this week and. i'm feeling good again, like him, because I that last week, I was like I didn't I feel like a human, you know. yeah yeah today feeling good this week is good. um yeah a lot better. And I. know I know."
383.0,Provider,"You want to stay, you know stay in touch with your humaneness and what makes you feel. Good you know. Because you do have that tendency to tip on that over that balance to over. Know sort of over productivity or over performing like you mentioned. right and just all cylinders in that one direction, and nothing going toward you."
6693.0,Patient,"yeah so that's the nice thing about my job now as well it's there's like not as even less pressure there wasn't that much pressure before, but now there's even less. Because i've already proved myself and i've shown. I can get it done so. You know. it's it's good it's just now, I can just relax even at work it's just I work, for you know few hours, take a break few hours, take a break stuff so."

6693.0,Patient,"temper color I have gotten I got obsessed because. You know who Elon musk is i've watched his videos and i'm like and he's like you know just working working or and i'm like I can't do that, like you know I realized I can't be like that I can't just work 24 hours a day, I mean. You know it negatively impacts everything so yeah."
383.0,Provider,So you were looking to. Have sort of a role model or.
6693.0,Patient,"yeah pretty much my that's what got me into this in the first place was him I always wanted to work at spacex so that's a long term goal but yeah. So, but. You know, not everyone can do that, or he does is. He may not even be. But you know I definitely line that I can't do that I need to relax every day, and neither of my time. I cannot be staring at the screen, the whole time i'm at work eight hours straight, you know I need to go eat lunch or go go for go out that's why i'm out today I made my because I have food at home, but I was like I just want to go out and get lunch, you know. Good to get some sunlight yeah."
383.0,Provider,yeah yeah. yeah and you don't know all I mean we don't know the. Steps the increments the way that he's orchestrated his inner life in order to do what he does you know.
6693.0,Patient,yeah that's true.
383.0,Provider,"And you know you do I mean I haven't read like the autobiography of the guy who started apple but. But. But you hear stories like that they're very unusual you maybe you read the book, but you know kind of. lifestyles in order. To to propel themselves forward and that may not be what you want, that may not be the kind of lifestyle."
6693.0,Patient,"You want to have about what I want I don't want my life to be all about we're going to me I want this that's why I got it just got to remember why I got into I got into it, so that my life. would not be about work I could make enough to support myself and support with doing you know what I like to do outside of it outside of work. yeah yeah. that's what I gotta remember."
383.0,Provider,"yeah I mean, and you know your focus and and diligence and hard work have got you to where you are so but, but then there's you know there's times to make shifts it's like Okay, I put all that work now now I can I can have this like plateau period of just like relaxing and enjoying it."
6693.0,Patient,yeah.
383.0,Provider,yeah.
6693.0,Patient,"I do. Like I get like when i'm in the zone like programming it's just like I get like it's a lot of fun, for me, so I kind of like get stuck in it, but I have to like. Like I now I said, you know when it's lunchtime and make sure to stop looking at the screen, I feel like forced myself, but you know yeah it's it's working out now, especially now, I think a lot of that was not just enjoyment, it was you know pressure to so now less obsessed. Just enjoying this short time that i'm spending coding and yeah and enjoying the. time I have off that more so. yeah and I plan to get. This weekend i'm planning to get away make sure I don't touch the computer at all going out with my girlfriends so it'll be nice."

383.0,Provider,yeah.
6693.0,Patient,I felt horrible even a week off it's just too much it's like. yeah.
383.0,Provider,"I think, also because of being in sort of this in the computer there's something I don't know I mean I don't do it at all to the extent that you do, but there's something that I think is just like our mind is not our body and our you know our system. In. In a very it's an in very abstract world. You know we're inhabiting a very abstract world, and so, then when. We come and it's it I don't think that it's where maybe not prepared for that you know as a we haven't I don't know like it just feels strange I don't know if you experienced that when you come out of it and then you're back in this world where it's just okay. The material tangible. You know sunlight trees food. talking to people it's different than being in that abstract world so a lot of time in the abstract world and Muslim new come out, you might feel a little bit like it might be a little is that transition, you know might feel you might feel a little trippy or something I don't know. I don't know i'm being very descriptive, but I think that it can be out of balance."
6693.0,Patient,yeah I feel about what to do.
383.0,Provider,So getting back in touch with like I think swimming is really great you know breathing exercise just makes you feel like human again like you said.
