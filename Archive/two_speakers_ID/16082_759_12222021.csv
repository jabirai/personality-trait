So um. and I started to do the lewd book my mood Journal and we talked to her yeah and I got about three or four days look logged in and I kind of forgot about it it's just like. Okay, everything, everything is like such a mess like this is my table. I can't find anything because I just I don't organize anything. yeah. it's just it's just crazy."
759.0,Provider,"it's just crazy right now yeah looks like yeah nice space in your House your House looks really nice. as well, thank you yeah."
16082.0,Patient,"In general yeah. it's actually it's actually really large, but you see by my step by stairs behind me my grandson said these aren't stairs, this is a ladder he's four years old he's cracking his grandmother. This is, these are not stairs he's, this is a ladder is because, like a ladder on on its side."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16082.0,Patient,"Exactly so up there at the top there's a loft. But unfortunately it only has feelings that are five foot high because this whole room hassles that are 13 feet high, and if you build a lot over your plus space, which is already eight feet off the ground that you're only gonna have five feet. For your for your upstairs. Before the lesson so it's like a crawl space up there, but the kids love it because they can run around they're not too tall. yeah anybody who's done it a child kit really easily."
759.0,Provider,yeah yeah so it's a it's a lattice done of stairs yeah.
16082.0,Patient,"It is a lot is so, but he and he knew I mean I was like. If he's just. He wouldn't try to criticize me or anything you just said. Well, not that ladder upstairs. Okay i'll look. And I see I see you're right."
759.0,Provider,He sounds cute.
16082.0,Patient,"He is adorable. And I have pictures of all my. Grand kids I only have three and two boys and a girl and. The girl is the first the youngest one and but she loves her brothers there. Lucas was born first and he's the one who had the heart defect. And so, he was like in surgery for. Ever me he came out of the hospital, I think one is the year old or maybe he was six months old or something, but he kept going back because there's always something coming up like he couldn't hear anything so he had to get hearing it. You know, you could his he couldn't stand up, so how to get ankle brace you know it's like anything that happened then go back and be examined again and try it again, so he was like basically raised in a hospital bed so. When he was four rows had her second son hunter. and offers on. To toby what what those words, they were not. staring at the ladder so hunters he's a smart ass so sorry smart Alec and I think he should be. an engineer or an architect, or something because he's very, very interested in building houses. uh huh like doll houses and everything. I was the same way. And I majored in architecture, so I have a degree in architecture, but I never worked as well, because I don't really care for the architects i've met. That all kind of arrogant so. The."
759.0,Provider,landscape landscape architecture and yeah.
16082.0,Patient,"yeah I did that because I had to put the degree to some hundred views. And I had time on my hands when I was a single mother was to infants. And no help, so I went back to school at merritt college. And they had classics I wanted to learn how to prune the lemon tree in front of our House, so I took I thought i'll just take a class, but no, you enroll for like a degree, like a program so I enrolled and I got an associate's degree there, while I was there. Which is cool because got a bachelor's from Berkeley and i've got an associate from America so i've got basically two. degrees, even though the the junior college one's not that serious. But I was very serious about that and. I worked for me. 20 years for landscape architects in San Francisco and. I love it. I want to be that again."
759.0,Provider,yeah.
16082.0,Patient,I think i've gotten to the age where i'm too old to hire people don't want somebody because i've been where I worked for so many years that i'm too expensive for most people to hire. They don't want me because. it's cheaper to get somebody who just graduated.
759.0,Provider,"And that they will you know by now, I want to pay you for your experience."
16082.0,Patient,"yeah well i'm they're paying for me they're paying me for my knowledge and my. overwhelming insight. into different. faculties of landscape architecture like where's the sun, because you have to know where the sun is looking at the plan, like the map of the plan. And you have to know where the sun is and where the shade is going to be and where it's going to be just bright sunny in in coming in the window all the time. And nothing you plant is going to survive that so you have to know you know all the second figure out in your head just by looking at the site and you could tell yeah. So we're. This our apartment has a West facing window. Oh getting sun coming into our House all day long, I mean not all day long but."
759.0,Provider,"All after you like it that way you get loud I hate. hate David, oh no."
16082.0,Patient,it's too hot isn't.
759.0,Provider,"I see the downside of having the sun, always in your window."
16082.0,Patient,"yep and we have to. Close the curtains and we had blinds is so too, because at the top of the curtains we've got a whole row and goes has blind because. Because the. going down it just shines in there in your eyes, you know if you open your eyes, you got the sun in your eyeball and you have to you have to you can't walk around like this."
759.0,Provider,yeah like.
16082.0,Patient,pull the blinds so so does it shine in in.
759.0,Provider,"Answer room off too. yeah so. You know, by having that experience or you know your wealth of knowledge in that area, you know and being able to do that, you know I I hope. You know, maybe one day. I don't know if you want to go back to work or whatever, that you can find yourself doing that works again."
16082.0,Patient,"I think i'm not employable because, last year I don't know if I went through this with you, but the last two jobs, I had I was fired. So the first job that I was fired from was at the census in oakland and I had i've worked at the census I worked in the census 10 years ago for the Nielsen so since 2010 and it was fun, it was great and I worked. And they were there. In 2017 for the American housing survey. So this is like my third opportunity, but it was the first time that ever worked in the census office and not like on the street, you know knocking on doors so. That was different but. I was, I was fired because I took two coven masks instead of just one. mm hmm and one of our co workers. Had horrible cough at that time, and it was one koba just came out and. I thought oh my God that is that man he's an elderly man he's sick, I mean that is not that is not a normal costs, so he went to the hospital and he didn't Come on, he died there, so I asked somebody to say check in. And no they didn't know so i'm sure he had covered and then he at expose all of us to it so. yeah yeah, it was important for me to have more than one mask."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16082.0,Patient,"But I was fired that's that's The excuse they gave me, but I know that's not what they fired me I know they fired me because I was doing things my own way. Because that's that works for me, you know doing things the way I did it 10 years ago or i'm doing things way I did it for years ago and. I think that's what happened and that wasn't good. It wasn't looked well upon."
759.0,Provider,From my yeah.
16082.0,Patient,"Then the second job that I had was working for the American housing authority, it was a temporary job, but it was going to last until this was in July it's going to last until January. And it lasted. For the until the end of the week, and then it was fired because I was asleep at my desk I have never ever ever slept at my desk I might be tired, but I know better than that i'm a grown up you know I don't do things like that."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16082.0,Patient,"So I think it was just I was filing and I think that's they didn't want me to file they wanted me to do i'm not sure what they want me to do, but they wanted me to do something different. But. Nobody talked to me about it, they told my the the hiring supervisor the woman who got me the job let's head to the temple lady. She told me, you know well, they said you were asleep at your desk you know that's what they say so. You know you can't. You can't go back to work there that don't want you so. and So I think part of that is the multiple sclerosis deciding what I hear and what I believe, and what I think, because it does operate your. I mean your brain. hmm there's been there's lesions all over my brain for this see it kills the nurse the nerves that are transmitting information from your brain to your muscles. It just interrupts everything and it Fries the nerve so you've got like this detritus in your cervical spinal cord and that's when you get a. spinal tap and it shows their pieces of the installation, for your called APP is called. The axons. And the the myelin sheath that that keeps it all insulated you don't like like the wire piece of wire and it's got that plastic on the outside of it and keep it insulated. So that's what your body has that too so but it's like my my cervical spinal fluid was full of little pieces of mile and. And it was obvious what was going on, and so I think it's a disease. The disease does it feel it's like not my fault. I can, I can think. Perfectly I hope i've helped jobs for 10s of years you know and it's been fired. Until. You know until I had to see."
759.0,Provider,So it sounds like it was just a little bit too much for you.
16082.0,Patient,"No, I don't want a temporary job anyway, I mean I want somewhere where I can fit in I can I can learn, and I can be a part of the team. You know, and I mean what happened was really weird to the second day I was at work there was nobody else there, like everybody stay home. And also i'm not sure if this was a part of it or not, but I was the only white person working there. everybody else was African American in. me they're already even any Asian people were. Just like two different. And I will see the outsider so."
759.0,Provider,So it's hard being an outsider. yeah.
16082.0,Patient,"Well, they they would never come out and say that ever, it would be like that you know they're not permitted to fire somebody based on their race."
759.0,Provider,You know.
16082.0,Patient,"So, and I know that and. And they know that too so that's why they made up some sort of mvp asleep at my desk. Anyway, doesn't help me because it doesn't tell me what I was doing that."
759.0,Provider,"yeah. which you probably would have at that time with a fine to know. yeah. All right, well that's in the past. You know, like right now you're working on. Building your life back up to you know with your disease building your life back to a place where you want it to be. And you know you know you have a mass, you also have with the breaking into bones. But yeah. osteoporosis process yeah so you know, right now, you just focusing on getting yourself well. yeah man so that's all we can do like we can financially. still be okay. and work on ourselves, you know that's a beautiful thing."
16082.0,Patient,"No i'm I like that. mm hmm because it's not it's not a finished. deal. mean I did haven't finished doing anything I haven't finished adjusting to having this disease, a lot of. lot of the classes and meetings that I have are about NS and. A lot of them. Are meetings with doctors. neurologists for my disease and. have actually I have one scheduled for tomorrow afternoon with my doctor at ucsf and I have another doctor another neurologist at Highland hospital. And I talked to her. I talked to her. Last week, I think. So, but. it's really. Everything is a zoom meeting and it's great, but I just realized, you know, this is what Everything is now like this is people go to work on zoom. or Skype or whatever yeah. yeah whatever the you."
759.0,Provider,it's true. yeah everything is done remotely.
16082.0,Patient,"it's actually really nice because i'm have to find a parking place Oh, I have my disabled step my disabled plate now on my car. night."

759.0,Provider,"being more active. You know, like. Being able to run do things, and now this. You down, you know, in the way and I know that must be tough."
16082.0,Patient,"It is tough because first of all, nothing fits anymore, because I just been sitting on the couch. On my zoom meetings and sheltering in place and not going out where there might be coated in the air or other people within six feet or 10 feet of me so. You know, it just. Is it yeah that this lifestyle doesn't really work for me I don't like it, that much, and I never I never go outside because I don't have a yard here there's no backyard the front yard, no yard at all i'm just the inside, my indoor space here."

759.0,Provider,But they're.
16082.0,Patient,"Not the same color they're different they're different temperaments you know. Domestic shorthair is just like a basic garden variety cat. But because because he's. Basically. I think he was owned by somebody who. Had. who had Russian blue cat like maybe the mother and wanted her to have kittens so they found another Russian blue maybe her brother or something, but it was like. inbreeding or something that made his teeth are like really, really weak.

No. She is half Turkish her father was a trick and. So that's why she's called tip on because that's actually a Turkish name and. it's filled with the sea, so it looks like say long, so we suspect when she was in school, we spell it with a J, so that people would understand. What her name was and how to."

She was living in Germany because she was a guest guest worker guest star bite. And she. she's coming just for just a couple weeks so just stay say hi and so she say she's been here for 20 years now, I think, so it wasn't just a couple of weeks."
759.0,Provider,It was like a forever stay.
16082.0,Patient,"But she got her Green Card and everything so she's legit and. And I also had to learn how to speak Turkish because I could say some things in German, but I but Turkish Turkish was difficult because of the verb if you don't know the for you don't know how to. conjugate them you can't speak, because that whole sentences in one word one verb it's like a whole entire sentence. So it's too scary so."
759.0,Provider,"Soon, so I thought."
16082.0,Patient,"yeah, so I would speak Turkish to do on you know when she was baby, which was little but her father spoke only Turkish to her never smoking so she was she was pretty fluid right away. that's been."
