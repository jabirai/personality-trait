15189.0,Patient,"Was okay i'm. Like. i'll be honest with you, I wasn't looking forward or I wasn't looking for. Any kind of therapy or anything like that, just to psychiatrists. But I know it's part of you guys programs, so you know i'm I mean i'm not I don't hate it. You know i'm going with you know how whatever you guys, you know. think is best for me, but. yeah i'm not a. person that really likes to talk about his feelings and stuff like that and. Since I was young, since before I was a teenager i've seen multiple therapist and psychiatry. And till this day I kind of feel like.

Everything that I was telling her what I was feeling and we figured out, it was panic attacks and anxiety attacks that I was getting so i'm feeling like I was able to breathe in the square the in all of that. wasn't part of my asthma at all, I was having panic."

No one is telling us that it's okay that we've got the pain. In fact, it makes perfect sense, and we want to support you instead all they say is blocked up be strong. get over it.

See i've been sold about a month and a half going on two months and it's. really hard you know I. don't know. If I get mad or sad or it's like."
748.0,Provider,"Oh absolutely. we're used to figuring out, you know, in a split second how to go from pain to numb. And not feel it, but the thing is that with with addiction and i'm sure you've heard this that solution to the problem becomes the bigger problem. Right, the solution we use did not feel pain, the alcohol or the drugs becomes bigger problem than the."
15189.0,Patient,"goal, yes. Yes, yeah."
748.0,Provider,"So you know it isn't easy in a month and a half people would say Oh, you know that's nothing you need to do this for the rest of your life, the first month and a half is the longest month and a half of your life. Because every 15 minutes some days it's like I can't do this."

748.0,Provider,every street i've heard mostly alcohol. But no.
15189.0,Patient,"No i've. Ever crazy. Yes, yes um and then about two and a half to three Okay, no, no. Five years ago, was the last time that I had gotten stabbed and I guess that 14 times."

I don't have a cheap phone, I have a plate instead of a cheap phone. I don't feel the right side of my face I don't feel the right side of my stomach I don't I don't feel a lot, I have a lot of nerve damage and so when that happened, I was. I was really addicted to cocaine and. Actually, when when I got stabbed the last time I was higher cocaine and the doctor is actually told me that the reason that I lived was because of the cocaine."
748.0,Provider,As you were anesthetize.
15189.0,Patient,"yeah because I lost a lot of blood and I had to get a blood transfusion and all of that, and you know so uh. For a while. That was still my go to but. You know they they gave me North goes and stuff like that you know for paying. As nice stop Okay, because, like I said, I have a plane for the my cheekbone my right nostril I also don't feel so. All the cocaine that I would do with only to my left nostril and, eventually, you know, I have a deviated septum you know I got my nose broken after all of that and. You know, so I would just the only reason I would stop doing cocaine after a few days was because my nose wouldn't stop bleeding. So you know I I eventually was like Okay, and he was stopped, but at the same time. The way opiates were feeling. They took over, so I pretty much. Just exchange for substituted drugs and from there was narcos oxy whatever and then about two years ago fentanyl maybe the. It may it made a epidemic and and I know that. i've had friends died from it, and everything and. yeah i'm you to this day it's like that's that's my that's the worst decision i've ever had. And it is sold on month and a half. it's. I oh I I wake up every day almost every day just wanting to get high wanting to you know and within the last couple months before I got sober like I wasn't even doing it because I wanted to like you. know it was it was no idea, it was like. I would, I would take a couple hints of it, and it was like I automatically will regret it, but it was like I. I just needed it like my body was just like I wanted you know and then thing is that. Okay, so you know fentanyl yeah I got really bad into it, but. It is all around me opiates. They take away the pain from all the stabbings that i've gone through, and so you know it, it makes me feel normal. You know it's like. All go out and you know and that's The thing is that all go out and then i'll do stupid things you know it's just like. wow so normal and I feel like Superman and it's just like I want to just."
748.0,Provider,you're not doing stupid things. fatness doing stupid you're the one that's carrying it yeah.
15189.0,Patient,"yeah and then. You like I you know I would I would get my hands on real oxy on real nautical you know any any kind of pain pills, or whatever I could get my hands on but. Eventually fentanyl took over, and even though you know oxy you know takes away my pain and makes me feel good and. The withdrawals are are still bad, but they're not as bad as fentanyl, even though I would do some and I would try to be like okay i'm not i'm just trying to stop doing fentanyl they got to the point where I was just. Like it just fentanyl, which is so much more powerful and ages and took over my life very much."
748.0,Provider,yeah absolutely.
15189.0,Patient,yeah I don't remember so much stuff on the last couple of years.
748.0,Provider,"Now what my dog is talking to me because she knows i'm busy, and so she is telling me that she wants me to open the door, I am going to go open the door, and then I promise i'll be right back I so apologize."

So when you said you were 12 or 13 when you started using that's actually considering what you walked through you made it quite a while before you did drugs, because I know, based on what you've described that they were available when you were much younger than that."

15189.0,Patient,"yeah so you're doing and it's you know it's hard, because not just you know yeah I, of course, a lot goes through my head here every day, no bad thoughts and you know um you know the the thing, unlike i'm pretty sure i'm bipolar because it's like. A lot of things i've done in my life like people don't you know when they first meet me and they're like you're such a charming person and this and that and like. I would have never thought you've done so much bad things in life and um you know and so it's like I I don't it's not that you know. i'm angry all the time, but it's when I do get angry it it's like."
