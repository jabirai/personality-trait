252.0,Provider,hey you. Know see. How are you.
12029.0,Patient,i'm. Trying to think now i'm trying to quit nicotine. So Mary prescribed me i'm wellbutrin and nicotine patches i'm going to go pick those up today.
252.0,Provider,"Okay, good."
12029.0,Patient,"Because it's hard, I mean I thought I knew it was gonna be hard, but I didn't know it's gonna be like so hard. I mean snappy. And then I relapsed on it, and then I was like I can't I was freaking out, you know."
252.0,Provider,"yeah you know. The trick really is you put too much don't put too much thought into it, you stay busy what happens is when we. were getting ready to quit something we overthink it. Right."
12029.0,Patient,yeah like obsessed.
252.0,Provider,"Whole totally obsessed right and that sets us up for failure, why not just the start reducing reducing reducing reducing Intel you're down to nothing. that's one way to do it, because if we try to do it just full bore and we can't make it it just builds our bag of guilt."
12029.0,Patient,"yeah that's what I was thinking too, because then, when I went to go buy one a vapor I was like yeah like getting all mad at myself, you know."
252.0,Provider,"yeah and that's not what it's really about right it's about being able to do it in a manner that you are comfortable with. And really keep telling yourself those messages i'm going to quit this i'm not going to continuous i'm going to little by little wean off of it, so I don't have to worry about it she's prescribing you wellbutrin and the Pack. yeah okay. Make sure that. Instead of this, is what I did was somebody else he started smoking when you would go out for a cigarette he would start smoking only half put the rest down. The next time that he went out to smoke a cigarette you smoke half. and put it down put it out and that's kind of you get your nicotine fill. But you're not obsessing because you're not not having these you what i'm saying. yeah after your arm will beat you in a couple weeks. When you start it you want to set a date right acquit date and the idea is to wean yourself until you get to that date of nothing."
12029.0,Patient,Okay.
252.0,Provider,You see what i'm saying.
12029.0,Patient,"You feel like leaving my baby. At home, when I go to work."
252.0,Provider,mm hmm.
12029.0,Patient,"So that I only have it like when I get home, I only like leaving it at a certain place so it's like, if I have to because either so convenient. yeah you know the I always I always have it in my hand if I don't have it in my hand I feel like i'm missing something. And i'll start looking around for it it's like is insane so I was like I just need to have a place out in the garage where it can just like that's where it is, I have to go out there to go get it, you know so it's, not just in my hand."
252.0,Provider,Yes. Any little trick that you can think of like keep putting gum in your pocket if you chew gum or you know those little jolly rancher candies so that. You know if. you're finding yourself craving for a cigarette you pop a jolly rancher or you know something in that you can keep because it's also a hand to mouth thing. And so you're still you know supplying that hand to mouth thing by putting that piece of gum in your mouth or that little tiny tic TAC or whatever it may be. And it's it will help you. feel satisfied that hand to mouth pieces done.
12029.0,Patient,To get a little bag of candy.
252.0,Provider,"yeah just you know, a box of tic TAC or something if you, you know what I mean just something that you can just throw in your mouth satisfy that I hand them out. and move on and keeping yourself busy keeping your mind occupied off of it."
12029.0,Patient,yeah.
252.0,Provider,"Those things, help. What happens is when we it's almost like a. Like a it's a loss it's what it is. You know something that we've been doing for a while and it is a loss. Yes, oh, you know what you. The message that you're going to tell yourself is. I have to quit this because it's unhealthy, for me, I want to get healthy I don't want to have into emphysema I don't want my lungs to explode I don't want you know I want to continue on this journey of being healthy. Right."
12029.0,Patient,"And I was doing with the kids yesterday this like drug and alcohol and fake jeopardy game, and I was the whole VIP section I was learning so much and I had to like not show my reaction, obviously, because to them i've never done anything wrong ever in my life. Right, but I was like it was like talking about. popcorn lung and all these different things that will do to you and I was like. Oh wow."
252.0,Provider,I didn't know that.
12029.0,Patient,"I started scaring me, though."
252.0,Provider,there's a lot of things you know you have to remember that you're still putting nicotine in your body you're just doing it in a different form than you are a cigarette. yeah nicotine nicotine right.
12029.0,Patient,"yeah and I was like my old. sponsor tissue is always chewing gum and then one day she's like Well, this is nicotine gum and I was like oh. This should always make fun of us for baking and stuff and then I like realize, I was like you're always showing that gum she's always change nicotine gum say yeah I have more nicotine in my system, then all of you guys combined right."
252.0,Provider,"Probably because that got you think about it, that nicotine gum is meant to chew a couple times and just sit in your in your mouth. Like a patch like a. Tobacco batch right. um but, again, it just kind of shows. How strong that connection can be. You know, to nicotine gum to the law, you know the laws injures you know those are just little minutes."
12029.0,Patient,yeah.
252.0,Provider,"still got my nicotine in it. Right. and have it so yeah and so you can become switcher addiction from the cigarettes or the babes to. Those other things you're still fueling that nicotine in your body. yeah it's just about a little bit at a time going easy on yourself, so you don't obsess about it. You don't you know think your addiction part doesn't think that you're oh my God i'm quitting right now, no i'm going to ease my way into it and then i'm getting rid of this, this is a crutch this is tearing up my insides i'm getting rid of this. Right. yeah so that's how this other person that I know stopped. Was that he just you know when he went out instead of taking on your vapor instead of taking 10 puffs like you normally do take one or two leave it alone go."
12029.0,Patient,Right.
252.0,Provider,"When you start getting a craving to go back out there, see how long you can go. See how long you can go. Without going out there. push yourself. Right. Think about your addiction. Right in recovery, you know that sometimes we have to sit on our hands right. yeah sometimes we have, we have to take it minute by minute. Right. yeah anything with this. same thing."
12029.0,Patient,"As last time I saw, to the extent that you quit so many other things. It was just easier there because I was like locked up pretty much you know, and then, when it's me out here i'm like I have $30 like I know."
252.0,Provider,"I can go do it, but here's the thing, even when you got out you still continued with a no use. So technically yeah you had a foundation, while you were in treatment, but when you got out you still made the choice to not."
12029.0,Patient,yeah.
252.0,Provider,"So that's still yours. yeah. I remember that. Okay, you still did the hard work. And it's the same with the with the nicotine, you know. find other things do harm reduction, until that wellbutrin gets into your system that's what I wanted to take we get when you take one region quit smoking and it usually takes a couple weeks to get in your system. Right you'll notice that when you do take it off that babe was going to start tasting funky. it's not going to be appealing."
12029.0,Patient,Okay.
252.0,Provider,"um when you're when you're when you notice that you'll want that a blessing last. So, again set a quick date."
12029.0,Patient,What is wellbutrin.
252.0,Provider,"What we drink. Well it's used for depression it's used for anxiety it's used for nicotine. It I have, I have taken it for a long time for the same exact thing, by the way. And that was like you know I quit for two and a half years, and that was the only thing that helped me, and it was because of the. It just tasted gross I just all of a sudden."
12029.0,Patient,"Like a more. yeah how weird. that's cool, though."
252.0,Provider,So just know that that you know set when you start you're welcome each and you're picking it up today. And don't get catches on and smoke with them. Okay um notice if you're having nightmares a lot of people I had nightmares with the patches. notice.
12029.0,Patient,I have nightmares anyway.
252.0,Provider,"Well, if you notice i'm getting worse, more vivid. Okay, all right um but only is a patch. On days when you're really struggling."
12029.0,Patient,Okay.
252.0,Provider,"Okay, because that's still putting nicotine in your system."
12029.0,Patient,yeah I don't like overload.
252.0,Provider,"No, because that doesn't do any good, but a lot of times. People will put the patch on they do lozenges of the GM so they're overloading their body with that nicotine at that point, it makes me sick to your stomach ache you know."
12029.0,Patient,"yeah right, I tried the dumb from my sponsor one time and it gave me like the hiccups. I started hiccup mean like. I couldn't stop and then I just got so nauseous and that's why, when she asked you what the patch of the gun laws like. patch. And I feel like if the patches too much you can like cut it in half or something. Because the GM did it like. They made my body like my wife is not like that."
252.0,Provider,"there's also other I mean there's the laws injures you can go to walmart walgreens walgreens I think is a little bit more expensive, but for one little thing of. The laws injuries like $10 and you can pop one of those in or bite it in half, even and it's gives you a mentee taste. And it does you know kind of crave kind of cut the cravings down but. I think that you're on the right path just get these things going and then set a quick quick date 100% quit date. and your mind in that direction. Okay. Harm reduction so just a little bit at a time so you're not filling up your bag of guilt you're not feeling like you're failing, because those are important elements that will take you right back. yeah right when you are stressed out, you know, and the first thing that. I need to get off my you know off of my. nicotine thing my vapor the turn around and no I can't. Right after a few weeks, you can set it to where. You can have an alarm that goes off. See how long. I. mean there's so many different things, you can do. So you have to find the one that's going to work for you. But don't beat yourself up. stay away from guilt. start your will be done. And then set a date like three days out you're going to have a completely out of your everyday routine and start building towards that. Okay."
12029.0,Patient,"All right, how long, would you say, like a month or two."
252.0,Provider,"i'd say 30 days. that's what I did. yeah from the first time that you take wellbutrin um because it, it takes about three weeks to build up before you start feeling the way. Okay. So, remember that. And then that last week you try to try to go, you know 12 hours without touching it really puts yourself tried to go on that last week right. yeah um and then, when you hit 12 try to go 20 you know 24 hours."
12029.0,Patient,Right.
252.0,Provider,"Down that's what we do. Now. yeah totally and then before you know it, you won't even. you'll have moments, you know where you'll think Oh, I really would like to have this right now and then you think about how much time you haven't had it and you're like. No that's not going to solve anything it's got a good not going to make anything better."
12029.0,Patient,"yeah that's how I think about everything now to live moments as want to drink, I just want to go do this but I like think about how much time I haven't like. Now. You know, a drink doesn't gaining better."
252.0,Provider,"yeah it's not going to help anything it's going to make things worse. yeah blue happens, and then I."
12029.0,Patient,felt start over.
252.0,Provider,mm hmm so you'll get there sienna just give yourself permission to take some time to do it to build to it okay all right. If you need help you know you know i'm here. Okay.
12029.0,Patient,And then.
252.0,Provider,Here is like you know becca has this really great program so she tells everybody and really it's educating about what nicotine really does your system right. you're learning it through this game you're playing with these kids.

252.0,Provider,"And then later on, you can say you know I struggled with nicotine."
12029.0,Patient,"yeah there's a couple of them that know that. Because I there's a couple of them that are like my little sister's friends close friends and so they've seen me they've known me a long time, and so they know I used to do all that stuff and so they'll always give me the I. But then the other, the other ones think i'm an angel. that's I got that. That position."
252.0,Provider,You did.
12029.0,Patient,"I did so I think it's two weeks into January i'm going to be transferring over there, so that the kids don't know yet. they're gonna be upset but that's all right, and I went and checked out the site, two days ago it's pretty cool it's like we have a patio and Nice big rooms all like freshly painted.

252.0,Provider,Have you been you've been taking your meds like you're supposed to taking go into meetings still in recovery doing what you're supposed to do haven't let any of that fall off right.
12029.0,Patient,"Now I am I had a hard couple weeks just with like. nighttime nighttime has always been like hard. For me, I think, because that's when I used to do most of my stuff was at night, and so that night time I get really restless and just like just weird and I have a hard time sleeping and then. Another these past couple weeks, I was dealing with a lot of like guilt at night, and that was keeping me up. And I was. i'm really good at not talking about it, and the whole day like you know and just keeping it to myself and then I finally just. woke my boyfriend up like three in the morning, the other night, and I was just like anything like talk about all this because it's like killing me just all this stuff that happened. Last year there was a. It was really bad, it was an ex boyfriend of mine sort of who had sexually assaulted me. I got out of there because I said that guy's a psycho I could just see it in his eyes, he was something was seriously wrong with him. And he ended up dating one of my good friends, for a long time, and they were both on meth together, and I was completely out of the picture at that point, I didn't want anything to do with them. And then March. 2020. He ended up kidnapped me in this girl and taking her up. To the Canyon and like just brutally raping her you know, and I had a feeling that night. And the next morning, I still had no texts from her nothing I just had this feeling I was, I was something was wrong because I knew, she was over at that house with the little sister. Who, we were friends with. So I went over there. And I woke up this sister chloe and I was like something's wrong and we found blood on the porch and we called the COPs it was a whole big thing and they ended up getting me he's in prison and. I don't know these past couple couple nights i've just had the worst. guilt about it, just like it because I had that feeling of I knew something was wrong. But I waited until the morning. You know and and they'll tell me something like you, could you had you could have had no idea that something that bad was happening. Right, you know, but again, those at night, especially I just lay there and i'm. obsessed about it."
252.0,Provider,How was she now.
12029.0,Patient,"she's good she actually texted really randomly texted me yesterday, and that was the day after I blew up or like broke down about it, and she said she has six months sober. because she struggles with with alcohol and and all that stuff. So that was like i've been thinking about you like it was just bizarre she texted me right, then."
252.0,Provider,that's a really cool. yeah so you saved her life. and probably the next person. that he was going to do that too.
12029.0,Patient,yeah and I think what that is she probably wouldn't have said anything.
252.0,Provider,mm hmm.
12029.0,Patient,"He was beat up. And I think once he has a God put you in the right place at the right time because. Just the fact that I knew I met her that night. And she said she was going over to chloe's house and I said I wouldn't go over there, because that big brother's weird it was just a whole thing, where I was just in the right place at the right time and just knew I don't know it was just it was a bizarre thing."
252.0,Provider,"It was a bizarre thing but you're not responsible. You saved her life. sienna. You have to remember that that she might not have told nobody knows what would have happened if you wouldn't have stood up and said hey something isn't right, regardless of what was at night or in the morning. yeah is is that you. You didn't keep your mouth shut You said something you went over to check on her. You call the COPs you got it out. that's what we hold on to. our minds are crazy and it's like the one thing that it wants to hold on to is the fact that you didn't call what time you called."
12029.0,Patient,yeah now.
252.0,Provider,"You know what I mean, but you see the facts in the big picture, the point is, is that you did you did you know get up and go you did go over there, you did check on her you did did these things. You gave it time because what, if you would have went over there, and you know everything would have been fine if you were doing over there that night or what if she would have text you when you were walking over there, we could go into so many different scenarios on what IFS. yeah right. Whatever was happening, whatever happened you're not responsible for, and you probably 99.9% sure couldn't have stopped it. So. You save her life, you made those calls we checked on her. And that's what we hold on to. It crazy how how you know our mind will will say yeah but. Right."
12029.0,Patient,"What if I go into the what is to and I like literally lay there, and like think of every little scenario like Oh well, that wouldn't happen that way so as it's sick it's like I just torture myself like that."
252.0,Provider,"that's what we do. We were just talking and that's not a kid i'm not kidding has what we do it's like. We were just talking about cognitive distortions last night right. Thinking errors i'm pretty sure that he probably know what those are you were intrigued man i'm sure they told you about them and we dance around all of them. Excuse me, until we start figuring out that that is exactly what's going on. You know, remember also that your addiction has one goal. And that's to take you out in any way I possibly can. Whether it be with nicotine and popcorn lung, whether it be with you know guilt and shame, whether it be with whatever right it's a very manipulative disease, and you know that. You know, when you have that those thoughts of those what IFS. Whether what it should have could is no shouldn't even be in the in our vocabulary at all, because their anxiety producing guilt producing. Right and our disease can use them to twist our brains. into coming right back to them."
12029.0,Patient,"So last. Last Wednesday, I definitely did. Have. A White Russian. You know that is I had two. Little glasses and so that was that was one of those moments, where I was like. And then next day I woke up and I was I didn't even make you feel good I just laid there and thought works, and I was just like. This segues nicely there and I had anxiety, I was like I thought i'm supposed to calm down, you know, I was like I was like panicking and I was just like the next morning I was like trying not to let anyone look at me or smell me and I was like freaking out. yeah it was just. What I I don't know what I expected."
252.0,Provider,"You know, different."
12029.0,Patient,"Right, I mean different, and then I just ended up completely panicking terrible night over it."
252.0,Provider,"happens, you know it the first time. But if you kept on that path. Your your disease would convince you to get rid of the guilt or suffered because you don't need it, because this is what you need, and this is how you're going to feel better and. Baba Baba Baba bought a bunch of lies yeah right, and so, remember that don't be yourself up for what you did happen to black or white Russians remember why you're sober. yeah and you get up and keep going. don't carry any guilt for it learn the lesson in it."
12029.0,Patient,yeah.
252.0,Provider,"Okay. And remember that saying, also in recovery. don't trigger us, no matter what. yeah right pick up the phone call somebody say you know what i'm in the spot, and you know i'm really thinking this sounds good. Right. You need to get it out. To the people that can talk you, you know talk you out of it can have that drink picking up that joint big enough, you know, whatever it may be. yeah you've worked too hard."
12029.0,Patient,"And that's what I was laying there thinking to. You anyway, this will be something fun and you like, what did you have for what I have a stomach ache. The worst time to get out like this is not what you need to be doing."
252.0,Provider,"Just remember that that those drinks are just drinks, full of guilt. So when you pick it up tear to guilt."
12029.0,Patient,yeah.
252.0,Provider,You know what I mean because that's what happens. We just feel guilty and ashamed and. defeated. So you get back up on that horse like you've done. And you can move them forward.
12029.0,Patient,Yes.
252.0,Provider,"Remember the good in your life to you're doing so good yeah I mean you really, really are. don't allow. That voice that negative voice inside your head don't allow them to take control. yeah they'll take everything away from you, you know."
12029.0,Patient,"yeah. I love place to be. Everything is so much better than I thought it could be like I look back when I was in rehab I was like what is my life, going to be after this."
252.0,Provider,You know.
12029.0,Patient,"i'm never going to have fun again i'm never gonna I was like literally how I used to think you know, and I like now i'm like everything so nice. yeah I. got my kids coming. i'm going to two trips for Christmas, I got all my family forgives me I hang out with them all the time, everything is just so much better than it was."
252.0,Provider,joy in your life.
12029.0,Patient,yeah.
252.0,Provider,"You know, but just got to be aware of that voice inside your head, you know, trying to reel you back and telling you and really when it tells you it's a good idea for any drinking or any using you know it's your disease run the opposite direction."
12029.0,Patient,it's not me.
252.0,Provider,You know what I mean and just know that.
12029.0,Patient,"You know, tell him yell is Joe has always been my biggest trigger that's always been my biggest one."
252.0,Provider,You kind of get rid of it.
12029.0,Patient,I know.
252.0,Provider,"I have this one. You don't have anything to feel guilty about with your friend you saved her life. saved her. And that's the reality Those are the facts. And that's what you got to hold true to. That you should have done it earlier, you did it exactly when you weren't supposed to. And that's what you got to remember. Okay. All right, okay. So you go take care of those kids and you keep doing what you're doing. Okay reach out to your sober support if you have thoughts of drinking if you get triggered you start having cravings shout to the rooftops. don't keep it in secrets give us it. that's really true. All those things, you know that recovery, had I hated them at first. We. Really felt, you know later on it's like Oh, and now I get why they tell us why God why they told me that i'm UK it's true. Definitely so just remember that all right and you're doing amazing give yourself credit. Please."
12029.0,Patient,Try.
252.0,Provider,"How much they love you. Look at that, because that says it all. Right. yeah remember that that's the eyes, you know that's the truth, through the eyes of babes that doesn't get any more truer than through their eyes."
