All right there let's see i'm trying to think here, are you still in a safe location. Okay, still safe. All right, all right and that's really good that's the main point right there. All right, and and I know we already talked about no alcohol intake. So just i'll go ahead and revisit it so we don't want you to add an alcohol nerd pills like xanax out of band klonopin value muscle relaxers sleeping pills, to be put morphine because that can eat increase your risk of overdose okay so scan you not that you heard that.

Oh you're doing better okay so because the thing is sublingual it gets into the system pretty quickly okay and that's just the hammer I know it's nasty. You pat and your feet trying to deal with it. I know it's it's gross because after 15 minutes you can split that saliva out as well right and sometimes a lot of people say because it it tastes that taste is not agreeable when they swallow it makes them even more nauseous. yeah so you only have you have less than 10 minutes got about nine minutes okay. Now right. yeah so maybe if you lean for like you're doing at a hip so it don't touch it touch gag you because of the teeth so bear, even if it fills up your cheeks. Okay you're doing fine.

I mean you said you, it does, some people normally in the last song Do you remember what you what you took. Okay, so on the street get sick from the pills. yeah so did you take the films. Did you take the films, the suboxone found. Okay. So vomiting so we got to put here vomit and after vomiting after four days off. Okay, so yeah Thank you yeah are you have anything else, like tongue or lips well or anything. Okay. i'm still here with you okay. So we can hear you vomiting I can hear you vomiting and you turn off the camera so wouldn't see it, but I saw you bending over and everything. Okay, any Tang or loops well under itching a high fives. Okay. So let's document know Tang or lips willing know it, you know hives but clearly your stomach is worse and she's vomiting. Okay yeah. i'm glad to know you're not by yourself. Okay. yeah i'm sorry this doesn't mean, then you don't feel well i'm wondering, does the medicine so each time you've taken it you've gotten sick like this. So tell me this Do you remember what you took their different forms of it. Okay, you because my understanding, you took the buprenorphine the locks on that's what we try to get what you've taken before and did it make you sick when you took it in the past. Have you ever taken a film before. Okay, what happened when you took those. Did you get sick like this from the film's. tora i'm concerned tablets you've taken will document, taking the tablets twice. Get sick okay Dan all right, so I tell you what we'll do. All right, will you be sick all day like this, I can send you some phenergan to spinner can help you. Okay, Dan them i'm going to send in some phenergan to see if that helps you okay. Okay. For you right now. yeah because it doesn't look like you're gonna be able to your this making you really sick. Because I don't want you to be feeling like this, all day. Alright let's get you some medicine going. Did you ever take now we can try to switch you to films to see if that helps. Okay, did you ever take anything that was without the song. The strips or something called subjects. locks on. Okay. Okay, so yeah i'm thinking i'm thinking. Would you say. yeah so it's so you dissolve some of it in your body. yeah so sublingual E you got the buprenorphine but i'm wondering, the mount a little bit of than the locks on did that make you sick. Have you ever taken a sub you text or the buprenorphine that didn't make that often doesn't make anyone sick. Okay, so we'll put here you've often met you you usually get sick from the these peach color peels. Okay. Okay. So what we'll have to do tour i've sent in your promo design, so if someone can get that in does that usually help you pretty good. Okay, so that's already there if we did try either the films that the fields make you make you sick. Is that a yes or no. Okay. Okay, Dan. So I can look at trying to get the films in for you to see if that helps you because i've had people be able to take the tablets but can't take the films and i've had people who've done better on the films and can't take the tablets, so what i'm okay. You okay Dan and i'm wondering. yeah so i'll go ahead and try the buprenorphine the locks on films and if that's still problematic we're gonna have to look at just doing a plane buprenorphine. Okay, let me, let me try this so you have a tablet so turn the tablets back into the pharmacy they can either tell them take him back or they can tell you where you can take them. To be taken back okay. So i'm here have you return remaining films remaining tabs. And so, you should have 14 remaining at least right. Okay, Dan and we will try films. As they did not make her sick and pass. Alright, then now just so you know your insurance company may choose not to cover the film, since you just had the tablets but take your tablets back talk to your pharmacist okay i'm going to put a note on here for the pharmacy okay. All right, then. So i'm just going to have you to take one film. twice a day or you can take a half a film twice a day i'll start you off with a half, just like we did with the tablets okay. And i'll explain to him what happened, while i'm sending in another. script okay. yeah it's gonna be into strips but i've had people be able to take the films and not take the tablets. My concern is I don't know if you have an alarm zone allergy or not it's not consider an allergy and adverse reaction. Which one. Okay, so the films have no locks on him, so how were you able to take the film's. Okay. yeah all right, so I won't be able to stay on much longer um so you may have to just call by her health, and when I come back i'll have to address it okay. yeah. yeah call your mom and then call us back Okay, are you able to call it right now stay on the phone with you. You spoke with your mom your mom say. Okay. So i'm gonna go ahead and. Try this and I know for a fact you're not going to release this sub you tax immediately, you have to get a pre authorization okay. let's see here one of you may have to pay out of pocket initially if you have money for a few sub you texts they may release a few to kind of get you over the hump okay. No it's just that you're returning it causes a controlled substance they may take it back and destroy net way is not on the street, but the thing is this they usually don't take people's medicine and give them somebody else medicines that have been taken out to store okay. Okay, you still there. Alright, so i'm gonna put here. i'm right here. All right, i'm just i'm putting a note to your pharmacy so when they. Contact your insurance company they they know okay. yeah and so that's the help kind of move things forward more quickly, because they won't release it unless there's a reason okay. So document net now, so we can move things forward for you i'm going to alert our team is the Friday so it's the weekend and sometimes so little hard you know we don't have as many people covering on a weekend. that's why we're going to go ahead and get all of this done for you OK. I will be working on tomorrow, so I will plan to check in with you, or you call him very you call in and that way, while i'm on I cannot check in on you okay. But the prior authorization that's usually need it is done by our authorization team and some let them know right now what's going on okay. The reason i'm keeping you on the phone now is because i'm document and everything for insurance purposes. So we can get that going Okay, so a couple of things you can do you may have to buy a few pills out of pocket, then the pharmacy may allow that, and you can get a good rx card, have you heard of the good rx card. Okay, so i'm sending it to them popping all of the senior record okay. All right, so, if anything, comes up while i'm away. Some audio it'll be documented in multiple places is documented on your. In your chart and it's documented. On your prescription, so your pharmacist a habit. Okay, we got thanks taken care of for you rest your medicine both is there promethazine is there, will you be safe and not use until I see you again, will you be able to maintain. Okay, I want to check in with you tomorrow okay so call me check in tomorrow, I will be working from like 10 to two but call me during the day to give me a message and i'll check in so let's check in tomorrow and want you to stay safe. Okay, and and see if they're if they will release if you'll be able to pay for subjects one or two to your prior authorization is covered okay. All right, thank you i'll check in on your car common Mr saw know when to check in on you okay. Okay, thank you Baba. For one minute. I can still hear you how often women I gotta get you off the fine. All right, there we go."
