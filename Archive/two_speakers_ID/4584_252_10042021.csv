252.0,Provider,"me hear me. wreck is your volume working. Oh, there you are."
4584.0,Patient,"hey my computer is super slow, so I was having trouble."
252.0,Provider,Your computer's being slow. yeah ah looks like at least a little cleanup.
4584.0,Patient,yeah I mean it's old so there's not much I can do.
252.0,Provider,you're saying how are ya. Any.
4584.0,Patient,"i'm debating whether or not to get this car. i'd have to fly down to La to look at it. But it's like the car that I want. And it's just like really frustrating to like want something so bad, but then also be thinking about the future, which I didn't used to do because I didn't care."
252.0,Provider,"Well, you have a license. yeah oh okay. And you're not on any restrictions or anything."
4584.0,Patient,"No, no restrictions."
252.0,Provider,that's awesome. So.
4584.0,Patient,"Even so, geico tried to quote me. Over $400 a month for coverage for the car."
252.0,Provider,What kind of car is it.
4584.0,Patient,"it's a BMW 555 is so it's like large Sedan. But it has like 400 horsepower so that's probably why. But then I realized that I have a driving with a suspended license on my record which is weird because I remember getting the ticket. But they never called me and for actually no I went in for my court date and they said, we have nothing in the computer. You have to call the DHS office every three weeks I did that, for a year, which is when the statute of limitations expired, so I never went to court for it, but it shows up on. On my record for when I get in car insurance."
252.0,Provider,that's weird.
4584.0,Patient,really like and I still have. A dui on my record until. April of.
252.0,Provider,This coming April we're yeah that's going to impact it to. Do you have to be on it so 22.
4584.0,Patient,"I mean I got my dui in 2012. And then I of course I fell asleep on heroin and crashed. My car into another car on the freeway and then into a fence so that's on there, but. I talked to the general and they and I typed in all the same information and they gave me a quote of $64 a month. Really yeah so I don't know what's going on, maybe geico was just like trying to get. their money back from me or they're just like we don't want to deal with you anymore, so they gave me a ridiculous price, the price for the insurance would cost more than the payments for the car if I. If I did geico."
252.0,Provider,"that's crazy. So, what are you going to do."
4584.0,Patient,"um. Well i'm going to i'm going to get a whole i'm going to talk to somebody at the general and make sure that numbers right. And then i'm going to do a little more research on the car, because this year of BMW they started making everything really high tech so like even the steering wheel is like electronically assisted and, like all this stuff so i'm like worried. When things start to break down I won't be able to fix them myself. But then again I don't want an older car on something that I can feel good driving around in and I don't want a car with a ton of miles this one has like 94,000. My last BMW had 300,000 miles on it for a crashed it."
252.0,Provider,"well. How much are they asking for it, can I ask."
4584.0,Patient,"i'm 18,000."
252.0,Provider,And what year is it.
4584.0,Patient,2011 is.
252.0,Provider,Do they keep their values.
4584.0,Patient,"BMW do pretty well yeah and the used car market is so screwed up right now everything's more expensive, but the thing is in perfect condition. Like the interior super clean. there's no no accidents reported or no like trouble engine trouble reported. But I would have to, for some reason they dropped the price like $400 just since so like I first started looking at it. uh huh and but, but it was over, it was over the first price was over market value so i'm not sure if people didn't buy it because it was overpriced or if there's something wrong with it and i'll be wasting $130 to go fly down there and find out that there's something wrong with it. And they I think they want me to have the insurance before I test drive it because, with coven."
252.0,Provider,I don't think you're allowed to live with anybody in the car.
4584.0,Patient,"So you have to show them proof of insurance, but then again i'm still on my parent's insurance, but it doesn't their insurance covers anybody who's driving their car oh so I have to ask if they have rental insurance. which they probably don't. yeah, so I would I would have to at least spend $64. and on insurance and then hundred and $30 for the flight. Right and then, if I don't like it i'd have to spend another hundred and $30 to fly back."
252.0,Provider,Well wouldn't it be cheaper first off just to look for a round trip. Ticket if you decide to go.
4584.0,Patient,"And then, what cancel it if I get the car."
252.0,Provider,yeah that way that part is here in generally you can get. A round trip ticket that is about the same cost as a one way. If you're looking for around.
4584.0,Patient,"This hopper APP. which it tells me like the different prices on different days so. there's there's ones for cheap cheaper than than $130 that I could get but I was thinking about going this week, but now i'm thinking about waiting to see if the price will go down even more if the flight price will go down even more."
252.0,Provider,yeah it's kind of crazy how that works.
4584.0,Patient,"yeah I don't understand. I mean what what's so different about. This week, like. This the flights this week are like $40 cheaper than they were last week. I don't get it, you know. There was no holiday right. And I missed."
252.0,Provider,Not that i'm aware of.
4584.0,Patient,I went to my. cousin's wedding over the weekend in paso Robles.
252.0,Provider,And how was that.
4584.0,Patient,"It was great I I didn't think it would be as fun, because it was the first wedding I think i've been to where I didn't drink yeah um, but it was fun and I brought my bike so like when I had to wake up at 530 in the morning because my dad was storing like I would just go for a bike ride. And I got to see my brother I bought a nice suit and everybody liked it so."
252.0,Provider,that's really cool. yeah so you had a good visit.
4584.0,Patient,yeah.
252.0,Provider,it's kind of cool to be able to get out and visit family once in a while.
4584.0,Patient,"yeah and it was weird because my old boss. And so the first night were like everybody was together for this like outdoor dinner place could mingle The night before the wedding i'm filling up my taco and he comes up to me and he's like hey be respectful tonight. And in my head i'm thinking. Like worry about yourself Gary Jesus Christ you're the biggest asshole I know, but I was just like okay like. I don't know why he did like that's what he says to me, the first time, he sees me like."
252.0,Provider,"Maybe Okay, so you think about the past, when you guys have gotten together before."
4584.0,Patient,"For before I shake his hand and say how are you doing or I just didn't talk to him there was. There was like a couple of times that I saw him and I didn't speak to him, and then, after a while, when I was like oh crap he did me a favor like i'm getting so much money and then employment, where I finally. You know kick just got to the point where I was like how you doing Gary but, like so the last time I saw him yeah I said hi and shook his hand but. like this time and just comes up and he's like try to be respectful tonight. I told my mom that she was like the health is problem. yeah. yeah he was. he's different now on. Like he treats my dad like shit but, like my dad still goes over to his house, he has a Barbecue every Thursday night, but my dad still goes over there, because all of his other friends go there. So he's like yeah i'm not just going to stop going because gary's an apple. Because I asked him I was like, why do you go there, like he's such an ass to you and he's like this is for all my friends are at on Thursday nights. I was like Okay, I get it."
252.0,Provider,"Because he doesn't necessarily have to you know socialize with him directly around them so. crazy in it. Oh. Well, good luck on your car. You know, decide to do you know."
4584.0,Patient,"i'm gonna have to really think about that one because, like. I know, deep down inside, I should just buy like a $400 car and then get a job and then save up a little more money and let each trade make me some more money, but like. You know yeah forget it i'm not getting my car. stupid idea."
252.0,Provider,"Well, you know, maybe. When you get a job."
4584.0,Patient,yeah.
252.0,Provider,You know and you're more financially stable.
4584.0,Patient,yeah the loan will be better because right now it's it's it's over 6% right now. But that's.
252.0,Provider,Fine it's still not bad it's when you get in the.
4584.0,Patient,"bed is with my mom is a Co signer. And she owns her house and she makes $600,000 a year so i'm thinking, like my sister's car loan was like three something percent, so why Why is my mom who's making all this money getting a higher interest rate than my sister. Is it different when you buy a brand new car compared to when you buy a used car."
252.0,Provider,Or it is. I think it is and i'll tell you what it's been years since I bought a used car what I got in the habit which is not a good habit to get into and now i'm paying the price for it is I trade it in a card had for eight years. It was a camry. Best running car overhead I be the shit out of it. yep traded it in a new one. turned around and traded that one in on a corolla. Because they were cute. yeah they did that one in on another camera. turned around and traded that camry and on the trucks that I have now and.
4584.0,Patient,never finished. The payments for any of them.
252.0,Provider,never finished famous for any of them never had.
4584.0,Patient,To do just that.
252.0,Provider,"alone in the scene that they can't get out of that, because now it's a used car they can't get out of it rolls over to your loan you work for it, and so I started out owing $40,000 on my truck. And that's why, and that was before co, but that was two almost three years before covert it. yeah and the market value was paid 10,000 less than that and i've had that one truck ever since and i'm still chasing you know I still own more than the value of the track."
4584.0,Patient,But it.
252.0,Provider,was her and getting closer and getting closer to it right. yeah so i'll just you know wait it out and I learned my lesson.
4584.0,Patient,yeah that'd be tough.
252.0,Provider,"You know. I was in this period in my life, where I wanted somebody you know what one Twitter was just like going yeah go ahead here you go try it and bring it in I hadn't traded the corolla in on a dodge dart. When they first came out."
4584.0,Patient,"yeah I. Have that target the turbo one. Oh yes, I did yes."
252.0,Provider,"It was it was an amazing little car, but little things were happening, I had it almost a year little little weird things were happening. And I was like oh God this cars going to break down is are starting demonstrated in and I took it traded it in, in reality, it was something stupid, like the feed that there was a light that was going kept going on, and it was because the fuel CAP wasn't tight double."
4584.0,Patient,Well yeah.
252.0,Provider,You know.
4584.0,Patient,that'll make your check engine light go on.
252.0,Provider,"Something stupid was happening. Every time. I just said, I don't have time for it, and this is what i'm doing and not knowing that I was really shooting myself long term in the foot, because they don't tell you that. yeah they want to sell that car. Right and so that's what they do. So I learned my lesson. won't happen again."
4584.0,Patient,"yeah I mean, but this this car, I mean I love it because I like rear wheel drive cars and it's a manual to six speed manual and it's 400 horsepower twin turbo so there's like a lot of stuff I could do to make it even faster, which, like a definitely do and it's only like 327 a month. And it's so it's an $18,000 car I would oh $19,620 at 6.6 Point six 9% and so like it seems like it. Like it wouldn't be that bad and I could I could just pay cash for it, if I wanted, but i'm hoping my money and each trade will make me more money than what the interest will cost me I just said, I wasn't gonna buy the car and dug myself I didn't do it oh. Maybe I should hurry up and get a job and then buy the car because."
252.0,Provider,you're able to pay cash for it pay it outright don't have any.
4584.0,Patient,"Put, then I would only have. $6,000 left to my name. And like. Oh, I do that."
252.0,Provider,"Well, if you think about it this way to if you buy this car on payment on a payment plan and it takes a little while to get a job you're still dwindling down that savings. yeah if you are, if anything, comes of your case it's still going to dwindle down that savings."
4584.0,Patient,"yeah well, if so, if I mean if I went to jail for a long time, I would just pay the car off because I don't need money in jail. Well sort of. But. um, but I also have this other thing I crashed my car February, like. Ninth 2020 and I had $15,000 property damage liability insurance and they turned that down I rear ended them on the freeway snow like he was stopped and I ran into him, though, so I don't know if he was claiming bodily injury to which i'm sure I had some kind of coverage for. But so yeah so for so ever since that day, every month I get a letter from geico saying. We are continuing with our investigation and evaluation of the last referenced above, we need additional time to source the sign pro rata acceptance offer and i've been getting one of these every 30 days since February 2020. And so my mom is saying like what if they come back and geico says sorry we can't help you and they come up to you, then I was like well i'll probably get a letter in the mail and then i'll just pay my car off and I have no money, what are they going to take from me. i'm sure. i'm sure, the problem is. So for all for basically a year since this accident, they probably looked at my. finances and realized shit, not only does this guy not have any money he's in debt So hopefully they don't read check it. or. put all my money and under my mattress or something. But then I won't be making any money so. I need like an offshore bank account or something."
252.0,Provider,"yeah. private bank account, where nobody can see that there's."
4584.0,Patient,"put it on the crypto but, like us, like the dark web and the sake name. sure that. i'm sure that's illegal, though."
252.0,Provider,that's all you need.
4584.0,Patient,"yeah and then to top it off, I was watering the plants, just now, because we were gone for the whole weekend and I the hose bib like had two screws that go into the wall, so you know you turn it on, and when you pull the hose it doesn't like pulled the pipe. Summers and the two screws were gone and there was a knot in the. In the host like pulled it and I broke the pipe."
252.0,Provider,Oh no.
4584.0,Patient,"I had to run and shut the main water off, and that was. That was at one o'clock my alarm clock was going off, as I was shutting off the water, so I was like."
252.0,Provider,"Oh, my gosh. yeah it isn't one thing is something else."
4584.0,Patient,yeah i'll be able to fix it before my dad gets home and gets. All pissed off.
252.0,Provider,Good. place it fix it get it done so.

252.0,Provider,"Oh, how is that."
4584.0,Patient,"Well, my brother and I were falling asleep half the time because we had been staying up for the past two nights, but it was pretty cool like got to eat as much as you want. i'm not a 14 I understand they're playing the seahawks but I was actually excited to watch it because, after the raiders left oakland for Vegas.

4584.0,Patient,"what it was like a bunch of my. My parents, like our family, friends like people that they've known for like several several years so and actually most of them came to the wedding with us, but there were a few that. That didn't go to the wedding who were there so nice to see them to call from Laguna beach not answering that one."
252.0,Provider,Why would that be.
4584.0,Patient,"Well, it says potential spam so. yeah."
252.0,Provider,You know it's been.
4584.0,Patient,"I put I put my phone number on the no call list. So I, and then I put I put a reminder down That said, because I think it said 30 in 30 days, if you still get calls from these numbers that you should report them, and so I don't remember what day if you did not 930 oh that already passed OK, so now I should be reporting these people."
252.0,Provider,yeah does it gets old i'll tell you that.
4584.0,Patient,"I get five phone calls or more a day and during the recall election, I was getting like. Eight or 10 text messages a day asking me to vote for this person or vote for this person and, unlike I don't vote I don't agree with your system stop texting me."

252.0,Provider,They are and it's just repetitive I my phone does the same thing goes up all day long and it's not anybody or you answer the phone and there's no one there.
4584.0,Patient,yeah.
252.0,Provider,"yeah that really hit home, you know."
4584.0,Patient,"It sucks because it got it gets to the point where I don't answer. Any phone call I don't have saved, but then every once in a while I get a call from something important that I don't have saved and it's like ah. So then, there was a period of time, where I started answering my phone and then I was like okay it's just all telemarketers now so i'm going back. If it's one of my friends, for some reason they'll leave a message or text me and if it's really important, though, even messenger text."
