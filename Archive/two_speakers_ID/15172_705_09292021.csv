The funny farm. And the clock me away for all week. But I feel better now I mean I was. let's say I handle it poorly. That sort of situation, but I never expected for stephanie death threats and like money extortion, you know typical tech wishing. And I try to get people to convince everybody, nobody will believe."
705.0,Provider,"And so from that, though, you went in and you're in the facility for a week and were they able to properly diagnose you Sean."
15172.0,Patient,"I forgot what you said, because you said being getting bipolar at this age is not a normal thing like I would have had it for a long time, and then you know so before something. yeah but the sort of the incident was.

But when I was getting started for money in my phone is still hacked by them, so I can't log into my Internet anything you're talking my phone wiped out, nothing. But nobody wants to let me stolen that's really true. I scared them with work like. I didn't react as I should have like a kind of panicked because, as soon as I started getting not enough, I was outside and you know we were this person, these people are. going deeper with the way they did it pretty paetec hackers and they you know, but I have known given so bad my bad choice of the victim. So just kind of handle it poorly kind of embarrassed myself, but I was like I couldn't scream, and so my friend, he said that there was something for me to talk to. And they end up going to that place and I was there for a week and then I saw the therapists once a day for five minutes, the docker once a day for 30 seconds. So it wasn't like, for me it wasn't really helpful for anything but it was like it's time for me to calm down. Okay, and so it's kind of I call it my call it being in jail, so my come, you know I probably would have the first day said it was I was on a Sunday. And then, they said Wednesday i'd be out like him to know there's a Friday i'll be out now and it doesn't Saturday, yes, they can pull them in there longer for some reason. But."

Suicide ideation or plan or intent, he did say that, like in his lifetime he's had like a fleeting thought and the plan would be with the bus, but he never had a date or anything like that, so that was in the past. The last three months, nothing last year, nothing so at this time by he is not showing as his self report he's not showing a risk, so it would be a no risk at this time for the suicide assessment. no need for the safety plan, either because he's not sharing that he suicidal."
