You were about to you we're going to start a job that and did you go ahead and do that just you can go ahead and fill me."
7240.0,Patient,"yeah, that is, I just. Before I left my vacation I just sent out applications for substitute teachers, because school years upon us so and actually I got responses from all of them for five but. As so right after I did one of them that called me tech 10 minutes later and asked me if I wanted to be like a long term So although I can only work for 30 days, because i'm not credential and no internship is possible, but long story short, the. Teachers on maternity leave till January, so they just need someone central they find a permanent person, but it's been really good. It was my first like teaching experience i've never done that. Jensen book work it's not the same. And it's a moderate severe you know special ED class so it's pretty it's pretty wild."
383.0,Provider,How many kids do you have in the class.
7240.0,Patient,"Six, and I think I heard there's another one coming on Monday. And the one eight we're talking, today, she said, there should be another age in class but, so I will say it was really fun. I didn't expect it would be perfect I just thought you know, and I think it went well and better today it's been two days and it's you know these kiddos are it's kindergarten and first grade too so it's like wow. Oh. yeah and I was thinking, I wanted to teach high school and maybe that transition, but after high school the 18 to 22 my older kids you know, but I wanted to get into you know teaching every like just going into different classrooms just getting more experienced and I thought. Maybe that way i'll really find what I. Right, I want to be. So yeah so they called me and I was like okay and kindergarten and first go oh wow Okay, and like you said, this could be an adventure, this could be this okay interesting. So you know, I was super excited about it and yeah I just I really like it. However. there's a lot going on and. You have to really manage your time well. it's very it's like down to the minute and i've been doing well at so that's. it's not always. Because that's something that's not my strengths, because or I just tried to do too much, but i'm getting better at that. Just in my life, and I did well in the classroom but I will tell you, though, you know it's hard not to just like have anxiety just being there yeah it's like. This where is this kid oh no we gotta do this look over here, make sure you do this, and I know one of that's like normal because it's just like a new thing and there's just a lot it's a lot to do. A lot to now and it's just getting into those routines so. i'm trying to not eat it just like I said, be forgiving of myself and just figure that nobody said to be able to walk in here be perfect so but we didn't really well we just for other ladies there we work really well together yeah I mean."
383.0,Provider,You have support them.
7240.0,Patient,"yeah so that if that's you know, and I just really try to stay that be positive, and you know we'll have something where like I just kind of have an inner. Self talk or or even out loud us know work we got this you know it's Okay, we don't get to writing today the kids are done it's fine you know it's better that way or whatever so but it's just when I today's better but. It has been for three days we didn't preparation for two and then it's been two days of teaching, but when I come home, like the first day i've literally had to just like lay down and like not talk to anybody. got me yeah. So, and I was talking to Dr chantelle about and I might consider. And you know, seeing what's available medication wise I don't know. Just probably you know, probably thinking that might be a good sign, at least temporarily in life and settle down but it's just it's funny ever since you've known me right it's like I think things are going to settle down and simplify my life is just I keep. grabbing on to more things, however, I think it's like it's a good path it's a good, you know it's just sometimes like these things kind of come to you and you just like yes of course now that's what I want to do so. it's exciting, you know if it's just a lot and i'm just trying to kind of pace myself and. not appear as my big goal is to like be able to appear calm on the outside, you know because I have these little kids and make sure they pick up on nervous, energy, the other, most of all, they all have autism. sort of thing, so I want to. be calm, so they can be cool."
383.0,Provider,anyway.
7240.0,Patient,yeah but that's that's.
383.0,Provider,"A good call um you know from my understanding, you wanted it was important for you and your family to find employment to find you know work that you could do consistently. And you're doing that. Right, so you met a goal that you set for yourself. Right that's why you're taking those classes right."
7240.0,Patient,"Exactly and like came to me and they're like Oh, we need a moderate severe like that's exactly what my i'm working for you know and. So know and it's it's just that this is interesting because, like i'm you know moving into new house, you know, but at the same time, I always try to just take the. can think of the word I just the demand off like you know it's Okay, if I don't get everything in today it's Okay, you know it can we can do on the weekend. like this weekend my goal for the houses i'm going to go in there i'd like to do you know line the drawer papers, I like. These things are coming i'm going to try to move in this weekend, but if it doesn't happen that's Okay, what is it i'm just plugging away at it, so when it happens, it happens and. At least I don't have that I mean i'd like to be there, but it's okay if it's not today or this weekend, you know any mean. Trying to pace myself with everything in the things like some kind of push back. It was like you know what it's Okay, if I don't do today it's Okay, if I do it. So i'm just trying to have realistic goals also try to take time for self care sleep I haven't been sleeping well this week and I think. that's somewhat normal however i'm sensitive to stress thinking about things preparing for things oh I gotta find some good songs I gotta. You know, whatever it is like, but I think i've done a lot of that, where I don't have to stay up and do like all this extra stuff so tomorrow tonight i'm asleep them. And then just try to have a relaxing weekend and enjoy going and putting shelf paper and stuff like that so looking forward to that."
383.0,Provider,"Well, sometimes with time management. scheduling scheduling your off time. Is is a good way to approach it so that so you do, you have off time but then you know, like okay at night, especially if you have to get to get you have to get stuff done like move, you know."
7240.0,Patient,yeah.
383.0,Provider,"Did you tell yourself okay at 10am i'm going to push hard and i'm going to i'm going to work on this, you know, to get to maximize the productivity."
7240.0,Patient,Right.
383.0,Provider,"And then at six i'm done at six o'clock I am done, and then I will relax if i'm not moved in yet then i'll relax at home, but you've kind of also looked at. The time that you can apply yourself to kind of serious productivity get it done because, especially with moving because. Right moving just doesn't happen unless you're you know that kind of thing."
7240.0,Patient,Totally totally.
383.0,Provider,"So, but if you can schedule okay i'm not i'm not going. To be really doing that, until a certain time so that all of that time you can be you know time to unwind and relax it, but then, when the clock strikes strikes such and such then it's going to be like you're going to going to plow away and tell X time."
7240.0,Patient,"And then you're right yeah. You know yeah. yeah. yeah because I, you know, one of my things was, I have a storage, so I empty that so don't have to pay for that is every time I go to the House, I have like a CV so I load that up so i've always just taking you know. plugging away then go put it away, but I think like you said, tomorrow is going to be like you know get some sleep, you know wake up path breakfast corral the kids and then. By i'll say goodbye 11th is obviously you know i'm gonna we're going to just go over there and i'm going to why I have to be there actually 11 because they're delivering bed so. So by maybe that is a good thing we buy 10 be ready to go and just pay at least pack up my truck again and then just over there, or yeah and maybe well. yeah i'll make a plan, but like you said just be productive and then just be able to say you know what this time stop it's time to spend time with kids you know i've been I have been doing that, though, because. You, the other day I went daughter sicko can we get you know these cookies to decorate I missed it oh yeah sure, but I don't know if I could do it today, and then I just told myself, you know what just that can wait just be here right now do the cookies. And it was really relaxing and it was fun. And it only took you know 2030 minutes so. That also is. I think, important sometimes to be able to be President, you know."
383.0,Provider,yeah for your kids yeah.
7240.0,Patient,"And sometimes it's not all my time is on their time too, so that's always got to be flexible, a bit."
383.0,Provider,Absolutely yeah. everything's going with your husband and are you X husband.
7240.0,Patient,"and I think that. It probably used to bother me more because I thought it was something that I would be continually exposed to now that I kind of have my own space, like you, visualization of the room of my head the House in my head the real house, I can go to to be to have my space, it is very empowering. And being. lucky to be put in a position to be a teacher where i'm, even though a lot of the ladies have been there for a long time and I definitely. listen to them tell them where team it's not about that, but that i'm a teacher and I have to run stuff and I have to say no, you did this and are you know or whatever just being in a position where I have to direct people or. That kind of thing I just make I just feel like he comes out me too i'm like you're talking to the teacher right now. So and i'm like no i'm not gonna do that I need to do this, you can't and I still keep in touch with them, I said now my hands are full I have i'm doing something right now Okay, I said, you know what you got this and then I just left you know, but just not. I feel like I was talking to one of the kindergarteners now you know and so it's very much. it's a perception, you know i'm. On a funny though yeah I think that's that's kind of a gift from all this so i'm just child like I said on the therapy just trying to ride the wave and try to take. You know what has couple little magical moments in the school day kind of put him out of my space out of my head and I try not to let him come into my. You know my life, you know because he's not So yes, if you're Nice, yes, we can talk if you're not going to be nice well. or dad so."
383.0,Provider,mm hmm.
7240.0,Patient,yeah I think.
383.0,Provider,If you're responding to that.
7240.0,Patient,"I kind of just do the. The cause I know they call it extinction and they call it something ignoring planting dory or something, but yet I just kind of ignore it. Right just walk away. And I don't have to have this conversation I have a conversation. I want Oh, you know it's interesting my my little brother told me this little thing which I thought was super helpful, he says, you know people will push information on you don't push all these things. He said, but I just pull out of that what I want I don't let people push you know their agenda their thoughts or words or whatever it is, I want to take what it sounds like his choice of what he's going to. respond to, as I like that so. Trying to do more stuff all this i'm not I don't know I feel like i'm. I want to grow, and I want to figure out these challenges that we we get in life, you know how do we deal with this, how do we feel good about this and you know."
383.0,Provider,it's getting better. Look how far you've come. To Santa I mean it's amazing.
7240.0,Patient,Thank you.
383.0,Provider,"it's really incredible like you have. disengage from an abusive relationship very skillfully very with a lot of kindness and with a lot of reinforcement without conflict without bottles being thrown. Up you've you know done that you have secured a place for yourself to live and your children and Nice safe place for them. sorted out the matters of where is he going to live he's going to stay where he is and you've got a whole this whole time you've you know prepared yourself for a job, and you have a job, and you have a job."
7240.0,Patient,"And it is nice too, because I might my oldest saturday's like constant supervision so it's like it will support service that if you're familiar with that. Yes, they provide okay. yeah so i'm. Such a blessing. And that's great too, because otherwise you'd probably probably have to. I would say, put her somewhere, but you know, like someone else would have to help her, but I get to help her and everybody wins, I think that these for my daughter, and I for sure and."
383.0,Provider,Just part time then.
7240.0,Patient,"yeah so I work part time so i'm still within my you know they they said that i've looked at the Rules it's like if you work less less than 40 hours a week you consider part time. And it is you know, at the same time it's like I working while she's in school, so I take her the bus I work, I think, are from the bus so. it's not I can't work a full time job any other full time job because I wouldn't be able to do that so. Sure yeah. So I have that so it's like at least I have that like i'm able to take small now have the retirement account to. supplement to survive and so have my goal is to have that at least say there would be nice to grow more than it is would be nice to but it's it's growing you know slowly and steady so i'm just yeah I mean I just it's Nice that i'm able to have some choices of like exploring. You know my permanent career and stuff but if I have a good opportunity that comes up and they want to hire me full time yeah i'm ready, but I don't have to take a job that I hate or something."
383.0,Provider,Do you know right right.
7240.0,Patient,"Soon let's see the same time, I want to say one more thing I do have a table in our class, I do have to do, student teaching for a year, so I if and I threw it out to these people I could be an intern that can be. Anyway, just you know one thing at a time so i'm here now and it's awesome. yeah i'm good just just need to get some sleep and do a little self care and. time for a relaxation and a little bit, but moving, but I enjoyed that, like, I will say this, I love when I take stuff over there, I love putting towels away we're at here i'm like. So it's actually it's it's a really great experience. To do that, so i'm looking forward to."
383.0,Provider,that's great.
7240.0,Patient,You know what I mean you just moves right.
383.0,Provider,"you're like where, am I going to put my you know. I think i'll put my cups over here and."

7240.0,Patient,So i'm. Looking forward to that and making it a fun relaxing loving place so. I think it's gonna be really awesome.
383.0,Provider,"Now, did you. Take a mortgage to pay a mortgage on your place or."
7240.0,Patient,"yeah so I. Like long story short way my dad had a house and then my brothers and I. least we split it three ways and that's what my dad would you want, he was always about very sharing fair. um anyway so with that I took I put that as a down payment. And I. kind of figure i've been a. Like I pay a certain amount for my apartment here, and then the difference of what the mortgages and the rent here i'm just going to take out of the retirement account so that way. I can still I don't live like a super lavish lifestyle, but we're not like struggling to eat kind of thing you know they mean."
383.0,Provider,You don't have to pay rent at the apartment that you were living.
7240.0,Patient,"I do ya. Know i'd say half. it's like $2,000 to the apartment so we split it, of course."
383.0,Provider,You you don't have to pay that or are you.
7240.0,Patient,"know, I was nice to him, I told him that well, first of all i'm moving over there and i'm going to take months to do that and so i'm paying him for this month as. Maybe extra super Nice and also tried to make a. chance, I think, for the word, but where you kind of give a little I, and I know he has everyone has kids are leaving them to financial concerns guess what we're leaving okay by pale in the whole red, so I said look. I will pay this month over here i'll pay the next two months, my house and then you're on your own so then it gives you time to catch up, you can figure it out you'll make it work, so I mean I didn't have to do that, but. You know I can't I don't I don't feel bad for. Anything I that i've been more than fair to him about me leaving. So, and then because he's really bad with money he has a lottery ticket, yet when problem, and he eats out all the time and he's very bad with this money, so I did tell him at that time. Not my not that's not my place to say it's his business, so you know you're smart start saving money figure it out so whatever he does he does, if he loses he loses. All right, I didn't just bail out anyway."
383.0,Provider,"Well, and you know I that's. $1,000 $2,000 that's not going into your pocket that you're having to take it or retirement to you know, but you know you've. You didn't have that that's very extremely generous of you."
7240.0,Patient,"I agree at, but that was. Part of the conversation, which was i'm leaving and you're not coming. So I said, I will be willing to do this we're going to go here the kids to come over whenever you want to you're welcome to come to my house if you're being nice I don't want to go over there okay. But I was trying to have a solution that he would buy into I don't want to fight with them. I don't want to go to court and battle it out, you know kind of thing so."
383.0,Provider,If I.
7240.0,Patient,"If that is what what it takes and maybe didn't even take that it's a win you know, so I think but yeah I probably shouldn't have to have done that. I said it, and I do it. And I, and you know. yeah I have you know, like I like to leave a situation like that, where I have no regrets like I don't know I I didn't know do him dirty or you know what i'm saying like. I I was yeah very generous. And kind about how we accident and I have every right to and you're lucky advice to you. After all. That, and I think he now."
383.0,Provider,yeah he asked me for anything no he asked me for money know. Right yeah.
7240.0,Patient,yeah because he will see.
383.0,Provider,You can see that coming down the road.
7240.0,Patient,"Oh yeah because he's you know he does he does no always. spend money this and borrow money and. Sometimes I will, if there's bills coming i'll pay the bills, you know I know he's using it to pay the bills Adams check us out at you, for the bills, you know, like two weeks ahead of time, but that's it kind of thing he's always trying to. Be death. So you know, in a minute not my problem."
383.0,Provider,"yeah and there may be moments, where he might try to manipulate you to because you know your kids are going over there and. So I would encourage you to continue to work on that boundary."
7240.0,Patient,"You know, absolutely yes."
383.0,Provider,"you're becoming too independent because there's been a codependency there has been also your kind of dependency as well, so. yeah you're. Getting on your. feet and you're. Both developing your independent of each other from each other. So, with the focus on that. You need your resources for your own bills."
7240.0,Patient,"Absolutely. not getting any. Easier you're a grown man. he's a grown. A man, make it work you mean we I have kids to take care of them, I have to pay my mortgage so. You work hamblin."
383.0,Provider,"Well he's got some. sounds like he's got some patterns that are very self destructive and no it's not my problem. yeah well that's the great great thing about changing your independence is that it's no it's. And when you have kids together is you're going to you know, possibly be pulled in based on your concern for them so."
7240.0,Patient,"Well, I you know if they want to see him if he if he's I just figured it's his choice you could be a good dad he could be president, you can find stuff whatever or he could just you know go downhill, so we all have a choice either so."
383.0,Provider,yeah.
7240.0,Patient,"I hope it goes well, but I just can't it's just out of my hands, you know I mean i'm just doing what. Trying to be. A decent person and that's, all I can do, and whatever other people do is that's there's."
383.0,Provider,Well you're being more than a decent person you're being a generous person and you're trying to establish your independence and.
7240.0,Patient,have your.
383.0,Provider,"Work and do a very hard job and so forth. And I am looking at your chart and, for some reason, your appointment was cancelled today at 5pm I don't know why that. it's very odd."
7240.0,Patient,"So I gave my last note I what I did was I changed group. that's was me kind of status kind of liking, all the people there, but um because I am getting home at 330 so that's not gonna work for Thursday three folks so that I changed to six o'clock and discipline appointment, I made a couple weeks ago, so I don't know what happened did."
383.0,Provider,You checked in through the virtual clinic.
7240.0,Patient,I did.
383.0,Provider,"Okay, so they just must have made a mistake and said that it was cancelled, rather than that you checked in. So i'll have them fix that. And anything else."
7240.0,Patient,"No, I just want to say, I mean all those little things sometimes i'll just sit there close my eyes, a couple deep breaths. And really all these things, help me, you know i'll share one thing that I learned from. One of my daughters therapists who said it, but she says nice Africa trampoline and she was saying that you know if that's really great. Because, you have the pro perceptive stimulation input in your joints and you have the vestibular in your ear and I supposed to calm down. And i'm like that calms me down because I escaped like escape part, and that is probably I think that comes all of this down, you know just walking or just doing doing stuff and moving anyway, I just thought i'd share that that was pretty. Pretty interesting."
383.0,Provider,yeah yeah there's some. things that we can physically do that can alter our nervous system and help help us calm down.
7240.0,Patient,"that's what I need to do i'll tell you what I did get I did buy. A hot tub because I think that that self care is everything for me and my fibromyalgia and. mommy deserve some good so i'm do I did that for myself and for the kids and I need to get back into like roller skating because when I would roller skate it was just in surfing, it was really. really helped me just be calm and stress free, it was a good place mentally so you to do more than. Just. Keep me to that i'm I said it's."
383.0,Provider,Okay do it. well. I will ask you about it. And sometimes as we you know go through life we find we find other things that work.
7240.0,Patient,Just to.
383.0,Provider,know so you might find that you get a lot out of other you know some other physical activity like bicycling or something you know. But yeah. If you if you really feel like you really want to get back to roller skating I will definitely ask you about that.

383.0,Provider,"Well, I think, times of day can be a good. One you know, like. morning like dawn noon and dusk. Those those are like transitional times in the calendar of the day. And sometimes you know you can, maybe even give yourself more than just like one breath, but you can give yourself five minutes sitting outside breathing in like in the evening. At dusk or maybe at noon, if you have a lunch break and it before you open up your your sandwich or whatever you before you eat. To take a few moments to breathe before you kind of just dive into eating. same thing with the morning, if you have a routine of like making coffee or whatever that you do some breath work before you start drinking your coffee and have your breakfast kind of thing."
