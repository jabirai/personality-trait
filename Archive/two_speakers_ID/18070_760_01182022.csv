To hit that pipe please, please, please like i'll be like a little kid."
760.0,Provider,Right.
18070.0,Patient,We fought over like. Two days and.
760.0,Provider,"So that's that's, the problem is the using and both of you kind of have a goal that you want to be clean and sober but. yeah he in. His life and you've picked up."
18070.0,Patient,"it's like one of us is ready and others not. Like. It triggers the other person and then, when the other person is ready, the others nah it's like. yeah that you know so it's it's slow. irritating or like, and I even have like stop teasing I want to say, maybe, six, seven times i'm not gonna toot my Horn and say the to learn to whatever no I say the longest longest was like two weeks, out of this whole year that i've been. Using was struggling. yeah. was never I never did it long enough. build the string and. motivate him to do it as well you know, like, I was kind of like. Well you're still doing it i'm going to just hold Ingrid you know."
760.0,Provider,"Okay. Okay, so talk to me about. What what it is about using that. pros and cons of using. Why do you want to be, cleaning and then what keeps pulling you back that that you keep picking up again can can we kind of talk about that a little bit Jillian."
18070.0,Patient,i'm. really well i'm not going as is and very like people person.
760.0,Provider,So I don't need you don't need this substance in order to be outgoing.
18070.0,Patient,"No, not at all actually after one day or two, it does the complete opposite to me."
760.0,Provider,hmm.
18070.0,Patient,"And those are my cons. Okay, the opposite, and I have. My own little hole and an involved like that's how I I feel inside and that's what I do to every everything and everyone in my life, like, I meant, like everything. Like I can't I seriously can't even take my dog out to the bathroom outside because I don't have big backyard, so I want him every not walk but i'll take him like around like a couple yards in my neighborhood. To to go, you know, so I can't even do that and I I literally neglect everything is a huge part because it causes lots of conflict. With nearly everything in my life."
760.0,Provider,"Okay. All right, and so um so what he said is it's only the fact that you like, to be hyper is there anything else that that pulls you back in. Is there anything else that triggers you other than knowing that your fiance is doing it, so this thing has to save your changes."
18070.0,Patient,"Just. When I have low energy and no more. especially my house i'm never used to be like. Not the cleanest neither is my mother I grew up in only child with. Just. My mom and she's. mentally. Well she's handicapped she's not able to work like the doctors. are like her income as as as I that. My whole life and. So she's never been the cleanest never been the most organized so me either growing up, but I am."
760.0,Provider,Like.
18070.0,Patient,"I do like to keep a clean space, you know, otherwise clutter stresses me out. Since my fiance started using this drug my whole house is just a frickin train wreck and I can't even like I feel like I can't breathe in my environment, you know what I mean. And it it's so."
760.0,Provider,"Because you don't have any motivation to. Actually, clean when you're under the influence."
18070.0,Patient,"know I feel well. it's kind of weird because when I found the recent times that I have gotten sober i've been able to clean thoroughly and get the job done, you know what I mean. I tell myself that Oh, I need a frickin smoke, so I can get all these dishes done at five in the morning and because nobody cleans the fucking house that me to tell you the goddamn sorry i'm sorry. So you'd so I never really irritates me yeah you're seemed very frustrated by that. yeah. yeah nobody cleans the House but me."
760.0,Provider,And you live with just you and your fiance is there anybody else there in the House if you can refresh me.
18070.0,Patient,And I live at my mom's House well my fiance and I go back and forth between my mom's house and his mom's but. Recently we've been having a lot of conflict and we've been at my mom's house.
760.0,Provider,you've having conflict with each other with your mother with.
18070.0,Patient,"conflict with each other and. I we are able to go to his mother's it's just I don't feel comfortable going there, because I know that his family doesn't. Like he doesn't like me anymore. I maybe it's just the crazy delusion of nine that's what my fiance makes it out to be but. I feel that he's only with me still because of port stuff and he has a domestic violence case, but just us arguing and stuff you know nothing. Really physically violent but um and he's had a lot of other charges and they've strung along all his cases through like a whole year he's got about seven cases which just little misdemeanors progression from the basic stuff. I don't know just. it's been a real different I feel in my gut my heart in my head that he's cheating on me I. I hear the woman. Like I see things like in my bedroom or in the car that it's like I don't wear makeup first of all. So what is that doing in here it's just like looking through them all the time talking to each other, he talks under his breath with his air pods. To her all the time and it's and I believe she's my neighbor actually even said it like under his birth like you wonder why everybody cooking true to like any is. meaningful to your life like your neighbors like, and I can hear him and that woman talking about like their relationship and how I don't know anything and she's always telling him that I hear everything and cuz I swear we are neighbors and somehow I still haven't like. taught them together physically, but I have for every other thing."
760.0,Provider,You have a lot of.
18070.0,Patient,"To believe and know, especially from his own family, like on thanksgiving they totally just like. joked around and sneak discreet, you know what I mean like kind of passive aggressive stuff and like home and I thought the other family was gonna come over like just things like that and. I just I know for sure, and I know this is not a delusion because even the time that I have gotten sober, even if it was just for a couple of days. Those things were still present, you know what I mean. yeah but um so yeah I I don't feel comfortable going to his family's House my house honestly, this was a really big stressor mine right now, like. And I feel so dumb talking about it because, like i'm doing drugs, you know and and like everybody's telling me i'm insane i'm hearing things because that's what. My fiance makes about to be to everybody and but my mom she she's the type of person to just sit back relax and enjoy the ride, you know what I mean and. She has even like told me the same thing My family has turned against me and the like you're trippin and done that kind of passive aggressive stuff little things like. kind of like what that statement I made about thanksgiving like. You know what I mean. Recently, my mom has gotten very fed up with the way he's been treating me because he absolutely does not show me any kind of respect or use to when really, really in love and appreciative and. Positive for each other, you know. and So she not go ahead."
760.0,Provider,"So tell tell me what it is about. Being with him that that you want to stay as i'm hearing a lot of negative. You know it's really hard to recover in in couples. yeah because of the experience that you're going through that one moment you know you're the strong one, the next one me you kind of pull each other down."
18070.0,Patient,yeah it's really and and so on.
760.0,Provider,"And then, also on the other hand, it seems like you've got a lot of suspicions and even even without the suspicion there's still a lot of arguing happening between the two. And and you're saying that your even your mother is noticing that he's not treating you well, so talk to me about. What you're getting from this relationship presently."
18070.0,Patient,"When I say miss Lisa to tell you the truth, I am getting traction out of this relationship, besides stress and. pain and. Tom for at this point and it's, sad to say, because that's not at all the way I like to think about my heart loving feelings for him with our relationship, I don't want it to be about. Her physically and because that's the only kind of. positivity he gets me now other than that he always tries to turn everything into an argument he always tries to turn. um because I cheated in the class and he always tries to tell me that it's you're guilty conscience and you're just tripping you're tripping you're tripping you're tripping. And you're too high i'm taking your drugs away he'll take even if i'm paid for, like a $300 bag, or whatever he will take up the whole thing he doesn't even, let me make my own purchases if it's $5."
760.0,Provider,Your own purchases of drugs or purchases of other things to.
18070.0,Patient,"Drugs things. Okay, no. Okay, whatever. Okay yeah."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so do you think that perhaps the the the emotional feelings and the problems that you're having in your relationship is a is a trigger for you, that once for to one of us is that triggering you."
18070.0,Patient,"um. Honestly, no it doesn't trigger me to. It doesn't make me have the desire, like you, gotta smoke some know. If it's around and we're arguing, I say that I like to do it kind of like. like somebody who's mad is like i'm going to show this whiskey, you know, like so if it's. A way to get in my."
760.0,Provider,way to get back.
18070.0,Patient,out almost but not completely in a resentful kind of. way. You know. i'm so sorry i'm i'm really having her.
760.0,Provider,"you're really well. blabbing no that's that's that's I it's good to. I want you to get it out, I want, I want you to I want to talk this through it's important to get to the reasons why you continue to use. So i'm hearing that you. Well, what what what is okay so. what's stopping you from building a recovery, then."
18070.0,Patient,"Just the fact that well, I mean I guess you're right because the only things that have stopped me from continuing in the recovery when I did did stop Maybe those seven times throughout this whole year, even if it was for one day or two weeks, and it was just the simple fact that. He doesn't have a license we don't have a car his parents have longer their vehicle for us to get our shit together basically and. Until we frickin get our own car and with that they've given me the responsibility to drive because they know he doesn't have he has a suspended license and, second, of all he's had so many duis and crashing their car so many times that."
760.0,Provider,They want him to.
18070.0,Patient,"get to. know they had to literally sign a paper with their insurance AAA stating that Ryan J breath will not drive any vehicles insured by this company. So he's not allowed to drive any of their cars and it's a very big deal to them they're very strict and like they don't approve any of this my mom she's a little lenient she's she smokes weed she's. I mean she's not cool with any of us with any of our using i'll tell you like, not at all, but she is understandable and she like. she'll work with us, but other than that because parents they'll be like hell, no, you can go sleep on the streets don't be coming to my house like that's the type of they're very strict and they go by the book, so I. I drive him if he needs to get something I would rather drive and with all the cases he is. search and seizure and I don't want him to get arrested, I have a license and. i'm sorry. This is going to be gross, but I have a vagina and if I ever needed something for him, like I would do that because I don't want him to go to john and wanting to get him. You know i'm lost just kind of what runs through my mind, he wants to go get something and i'm cream and I have been very successful with a long period of sobriety because i'm in those situations where it's like we're in the car in chinatown and you're walking around. A frickin I don't know a new broom and offering every 10th like. You want to buy this for like 10 bucks and then somebody comes in acquiring starts keeping it up and i'm like. That you know after it's an everyday thing."
760.0,Provider,"i'm hearing a lot of reasons Julian why he needs you but i'm not hearing a whole lot why you need him. Can you talk to me. about that, because you said you said you're not getting anything but stress from the relationship."
18070.0,Patient,"So, then, I don't need him at all."
760.0,Provider,Within what is.
18070.0,Patient,"I. I do love him so, but at this point i'm so nominate her like i'm i've given up in that area, but like half of it is still there, just very nandan don't I love to he really is because, when he's not using i'll tell you what he is a very intelligent sweet kind and like. he's a great person and. he's in he's so smart he's an electrician for god's sakes like he just got his electrician. technician license and he he's so smart and he's great like he's hilarious and. When he's using. All he cares about his heroin it's like you're your new wife is heroin and everything else in your life does not matter you know and that that's how it is and he's so mean and. Every The world is his enemy when he's using and I love him for who he is, and I am still here, because sometimes I see that side of him, try to come out but it's it's really hard to deal with the day to day. Using you know and. I only see that sometimes and and I feel with all of the behaviors surrounded around both of us eating it's it's so toxic that it's like. That love is made in there anymore, but i'm just hoping and frame I guess that he will come back and snap out of it, and if I get clean i'm strong enough to be motivated to stuff like that, but. I also feel have. Responsible because and Mike."
760.0,Provider,For him.
18070.0,Patient,"Yes, yeah because there's been a few times, where I really, really wanted to just walk away say you through my ring and like literally almost lesson in a different town like. man like and he's pushing my limits, but I stayed because I didn't want because I loved him so much that I didn't want him to go more downhill, and I feel guilty that it's my fault that we're both here in the first place, because. He has a history of using before we first met, we met and we were both silver i've never tried any hardcore drugs, besides oxy coburn and xanax like I told you and. marijuana and stuff. We met were dating for a year year and a half into our our relationship. My mom's boyfriend had a friend who would come over and he was a major cocaine dealer and they would do lines and stuff and I was in nursing school at the time, and he did a couple, and then I did a couple, and then you know how that goes after. Having a good time, you know. I was just like I have a test every freakin day at 70 am i'm in nursing school I need he up I need to study like. And I just kept using and using and he warned me he told me several times, and they baby, please come on, you know that I i'm playing now i've been clean for four years, I don't do heroin or because that's his drug of choice, but. Men comes on the side with that so i've learned for a lot of heroin users, because it's like a running out kind of thing. yeah so we was very triggered when we when I was you, we were both using cocaine and he tried to tell me please stop buying who stopped buying sex and he I live, I went behind his back he bought them and. One day I just saw him in the restroom because his son was like JEREMY to me i'm like Daddy fell over and he was just there with the pipe and I was like oh my God and it's just worse and worse since then I gradually like to laugh."
760.0,Provider,yeah okay. So how motivated Is this something you want to work on.
18070.0,Patient,"So you know, but I think it's just not a point where it's us or me because, if he's not thinking well if he's not thinking about him, then we can do us, you know."
760.0,Provider,"Are the drugs what what, what is your experience drugs is like a. substance use disorder is a condition that continues to evolve and get worse over time, would you do disagree agree or disagree with that Julian."
18070.0,Patient,And I would agree.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so if you're going to continue to use and if he's continuing to use so that means that. Both of you are that's going to get a worsening condition fair to say."
18070.0,Patient,Yes.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so that being said, there, there are stages to change and people can kind of contemplate change for a long period of time relapse can be part of recovery, but at the end of the day. You know, taking steps doing things different. Building a support system. Because i'm not hearing that you have a big support system right now."
18070.0,Patient,"I don't feel that I have any support system to tell you the truth. I do have my mom and my brother and. My family that I can call, but I. I don't have any buddy that I can really talk to in in a neutral way. or where i'm not being judged where my fiance is not being judged and hated you know and it's like. I don't know it's really hard I don't know where to look for that, because I i've secluded myself. From Rhea from. Just my community and everybody off people pretty much."
760.0,Provider,Okay. Okay. So where do you stand now as far as. This moment right now here with me and the session building your recovery. Where do you feel your motivation is. Without judgment i'm not i'm just trying i'm just trying to assess.
18070.0,Patient,"and Honestly, like when I wake up in the morning, the first thing I think about is. Like the first plans that popped into my head. it's always a war between like what I can do to make him like love me more recognize me more or like get things back to the way we used to be. which can be by various steps like you know. Or, but my life true true like where I stand, what I strive to do is always for myself at the end of the day, I want to work, I want to get out of out of this. And i'm almost feeling like I want to, I want to get out of this relationship, like because it's just dragging both of us down not only need a smoke i'm not all innocent, you know, like i'm sure I do the same thing to him that he does to me. In a way, that we influence each other. And I don't use heroin but it's triggering to me when he uses it and i'm like I just want to get high too, you know. yeah um so I I really right now, where I stand, is just I need to start working I need to get clean completely for a while and I really want to spend more time with my dog and my family because i've been neglecting them and."
760.0,Provider,"Your dog and your family so that means your mother and your brother, you mentioned your brother. yeah Okay, and then your dog."
18070.0,Patient,yeah.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so."
18070.0,Patient,"i've been pondering the idea of. Joining the navy, I always it's always been my dream to join the military but um I was a bad bad kid and I had a charge. Even though I was under 18 the navy didn't accept me, and that was the branch, I really wanted to go, for I was in nj rotc all four years of high school, so it was like a big bummer and I was sad for a while, but i'm like I got my. record, sealed and a lot of my charges dropped or. Even dismissed so. i've been thinking about just getting my bachelor's of science in nursing and continue on with my education and then after I get that join the navy."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, but how is your substance use going to affect your goals to spend time with your family to further your education and to join the navy or create any career really if we just talked about how its substance use disorder is a giant downward spiral."
18070.0,Patient,"performing on let's let's. see if you need more help than individual sessions, do you."
760.0,Provider,"think you need. A higher level of care for your drug problem. And if so, do you think you're ready for that right now. that's like two separate questions that I want you to ask, because you, you can say yes to that, then you can also tell me I don't really feel ready for that or maybe you can tell me, I do feel ready for that so tell me where you stand on but."
18070.0,Patient,"I feel that I am a very strong person and i'm not just like putting it out there and over like shooting for the moon, I know that in my heart, and in my gut and in my head, that if I wasn't with my fiance I would have been clean, the first time I tried to get clean Okay, but. So I don't believe I need like extra assistance with. Drug usage. I mean, I may need a little extra help because there were maybe like Weiss, where I was like you know what I really want to smoke. Without any type of influence, where he didn't bring it around at all, but you know what I was able to just like brush it off my shoulders, but he was very like oh yeah here, and then you know, so I was like okay and i'm not blaming him at all, but like. Oh, my God. To answer your second question i'm sorry i'm."
760.0,Provider,"Well, you kind of answered the first question kind of already answered the second question so you're saying. you're saying that being with him is you think that you have the ability to build a recovery, if you were not in your life."
18070.0,Patient,"um if you weren't using and. If you weren't that's the issue that I have deciding between those two statements yours and mine if he weren't in my life, or if he weren't using and I guess I like the way you phrase that question. Because I need to stop waiting for him. Because this is like my life and. i'm 21 and I feel like i'm I wasted a whole like year. And even though i'm so young, and I got many more to go it's a real shame. Even even graduated nursing school and i've had two jobs on nursing facilities, I feel like I didn't accomplish it in a way that I wanted to, I feel I don't feel fulfilled because."
760.0,Provider,"You you have some barriers. You have some blocks that are caused by the substance, use the cost further problems for you and so just i'm bringing that up because of the spy well part you know people have a tendency to. You know struggle in relationships, they struggle getting to work they oftentimes struggle with legal problems. there's a lot that goes on, with that."
18070.0,Patient,yeah.
760.0,Provider,"You know, and the other question I have. Do you have control over his using or his not using is there any way for you Jillian to control his using."
18070.0,Patient,"um. I cannot control his using at all, but. He does have the respect to not smoke in front of me. If I asked and. But I have to be very repetitive, and he has to be in a good mind state because. My fiance is what you call a. garbage garbage disposal like for drug know there's a different thing for it, but like anything he'll take doesn't matter what it is like. It he'll he'll jump on to the next thing and make that as a replacement or substitute you know, and he tends to get very disoriented and loss and very quickly. With sedated and they have a very big effect on him and it happens, a lot, because he does joy's antics a lot and. So when he's in that state of mind it's very, very hard to to reason or get any kind of point across to him and I have. relapse a couple times like that not saying it's his fault, but just. Like a week of him using xanax and being out of it i've just been like Oh, let me hit five you're hitting it in front of me but sorry My point is he is very good about not using in front of me and I asked him, please do on anything like that around. excited trolling usage know he does his own thing I cannot stop him. at all."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, and and also, you should you shared with me that it's still a trigger even if he is being respectful to you and not using in front of you and trying to keep it private and hidden from you, you still know so it's still a trigger so it's kind of like. we're kind of in the cycle."
18070.0,Patient,"yeah. It is like I see the behaviors of him just tweaking out and like messing with a bunch of stuff. The House and making a mess like it, it really, really triggers me not only doesn't make me angry, but then it makes me want to get high too because i'm like well I could be. Cleaning this. stuff you know okay."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so So what is the action you want to take with all that we talked about a lot of stuff we talked about problems with your relationship your usage what are some what are some goals that you want to work on with this."
18070.0,Patient,"That. I pondered for a while and I can't seem to decide or. Really commit to one or even a few tiny ones, because I feel like they're going to be wrong or i'm going to regret it."
760.0,Provider,"what's it. what's a tiny this all right what's a tiny goal. Like like the meeting so tiny goal, or like what What do you mean by that."
18070.0,Patient,Like Warren tiny one could be just. man. Sticking up for myself without getting very upset and angry.
760.0,Provider,"You will. In other words, in other words, and with other people like you talked about earlier."
18070.0,Patient,Okay.
760.0,Provider,"Are they going to be drug testing, you and your new job."
18070.0,Patient,"i'm i'm not sure. But I have my initial physical gun and I wasn't asked to provide a ua but i'm sure, maybe, if something happens, they will definitely they can text me anytime to tell you the truth, yeah and that's another reason why I need to stop this as soon as possible because. yeah okay."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so i'm hearing perhaps you're you're wanting to stop and then you don't want to stop and so there's this constant battle going on."
18070.0,Patient,Oh yeah.
760.0,Provider,Within you on on that.
18070.0,Patient,Definitely.
760.0,Provider,"So if you were if if let's just try it let's try this little exercise Julian if you were to all of a sudden wake up and feel extremely motivated. To build a recovery i'm going to do whatever it takes no matter what that is to to get clean and sober are you still with me Julian I lost you for a minute I can't hear you Oh, there you go."
18070.0,Patient,yeah.
760.0,Provider,So you know I don't know if you did you hear any of that did you lose me as well.
18070.0,Patient,"Yes, I heard you. Okay it's just like a little. drying, it is a pop okay."
760.0,Provider,"All right, so what what what would."
18070.0,Patient,What would be some of the steps.
760.0,Provider,That you think you would need to really be to build a recovery if all of a sudden your motivation went from a low level of motivation that you have now to like a 10 plus what would be the steps that.
18070.0,Patient,"That happens to me, sometimes to announce that honestly, those are the times that I I did get clean. Besides the times that I just needed to sleep. I think, like the most the times that I was motivated. I just I needed to for one clean my environment of just clutter and, all things that remind me of it and not. Removers yeah not go around. places where those drugs are sold or like. That people not bad people but. People I would smoke with and stuff and. Honestly, I can do that and get clean every time, but I will never stay clean, unless I have. A. Like not a purpose, but like something that I do every day in a new team like working out I used to love to work out and I neglected that i'm."
760.0,Provider,Building a.
18070.0,Patient,route having a routine.
760.0,Provider,"yeah okay. Okay, I know you have cold right now so you've kind of limited. So. What. Okay, so. I want you to I want you to feel free Jillian, to be honest with me and if you're not ready to stop using it, the most important thing in these sessions is your honesty number one with yourself. But, by extension, also with me it's not my place to judge where you're at i'm just helping you to kind of question what you're doing so, you know. so that you can kind of discover for yourself. where you want your life to go in life so. That being said. How would you rate your motivation sitting here right now in this moment to be to work on on the recovery on a scale of one to 10 one with being like I just don't have. No motivation whatsoever and 10 like the most extreme motivation."
18070.0,Patient,"Honestly, in this very moment."
760.0,Provider,In this moment.
18070.0,Patient,"i'm at like. Three or four like. To tell you the truth, I wanted to go and smoke right now Okay, but. i'm. it's weird because some days of like one, and I can stay up all night smoke smoke smoke and then out of nowhere i'll feel like a 10. For. A whole week and. Maybe it's just like an event or something that i'm passionate about that sparks me to have that motivation I don't know really. But. I wish I could have that like rating all the time because."
760.0,Provider,"they're motivated, I have a 10 you mean. hmm OK. Well, is that really realistic, though, did you do you think that. i'm in being we. know where the human condition is you know we wake up, we have a great day, then the next day we wake up it's terrible day and then most days it's just kind of like level for for a lot of people you're going to have your highs and your lows and. You know, when a person is in recovery or working to build one either way. you're going to have your days, where you're strong with with high motivation and you're going to have your days, where you don't so tools, one of the one of the most important tools Jillian is a positive support system. And so. You know, we talked about the zoom meetings I know you have coded. You know that can be a routine. So."
18070.0,Patient,don't know how to like find all that information to tell you the truth.
760.0,Provider,Do you want me to have right heart health look it up and email it to you.
18070.0,Patient,That would be nice okay and. I just feel like. somebody's watching or listening to.
760.0,Provider,"What do you mean like in in your living environment you mean. Okay, which is why you were out walking around earlier."
18070.0,Patient,"yeah because those first questions that you asked me like I had to really. be honest, because I mean. that's what you're here, for you know."
760.0,Provider,"yeah it's important that you when we have these sessions that you're in an environment that's safe that you can say the things that you need to say. So okay so i'm going to have i'm going to reach out to. The Department that does this and look for 12 step meetings nakata narcotics narcotics anonymous meetings for you in your area. Probably on zoom i'll have them email them to you so that's that's like one must have the other thing I kind of want to mention with recovery Julian is that. it's not recovery is not. Just the absence of a pert you know, a person doesn't use substances anymore it's not just that it's it's the process of it starts with that, but then you have, then you learn new ways to replace. The substance use. And in your life and build new things to. that are important to you, new coping skills new ways of thinking new people that you're going to hang around. All of that."
18070.0,Patient,"I think I definitely need all right, especially new coping skills, because. I mean. They work. But I am. all or nothing type of person I guess you could say it's zero or hundred for me and. I will take my. Let me take a second to breathe, to the extreme and stupid little rug and never talk about it again, or I will take my complaint aren't not complaint, I will take my. proposition or talk, or whatever you want to call it, to the very extreme and the very demanding and. yeah it's all or nothing for me and oh my God, I totally forgot what my point wasn't so."
760.0,Provider,"All right. Well, we were talking i'm still trying to instill working on like a one goal. Would you be willing to go to if I help you and Brian her health emails you the contact list for the meetings, would you be willing to do that, once you're no longer just recovered free or if you're not calling free, at least on zoom."
18070.0,Patient,i'm definitely I would I would honestly prefer to go in person.
760.0,Provider,I think it's I think it's more effective in person myself too.
18070.0,Patient,yeah.
760.0,Provider,I don't know what the situation is with the meeting style so.
18070.0,Patient,"I don't have anything against it, I just. I don't um."
760.0,Provider,You don't feel ready.
18070.0,Patient,"I don't feel ready for that, yet no."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, well, I."
18070.0,Patient,really true.
760.0,Provider,"Well, I I appreciate that that's what I want i'm i'm trying to nudge you in certain ways, but I want you to be completely 100% honest with me. And so let's take a different goal, something that you do feel more motivated to work on that would help you feel better you think exercise, maybe you know walking your dog every day for 20 minutes is there some small steps that you could take to work on you."
18070.0,Patient,yeah. i'm. I would say. yeah. Which.
760.0,Provider,Which goal.
18070.0,Patient,"I love to exercise and I neglected my not only everybody in my life, but my dog. and Nobody else, no, I mean my mom and. My fiance that will take him out but, at the end of the day, it's my responsibility and. I don't want to ask it asked 10 times a day and i'm sure they don't they sure as hell don't want to do it either you know. Okay well. I know they don't. Okay, and like i'm basically torturing him, so I think one goal, I can do for myself is. Go for a walk with him every day, at least for like. Not only around our block that's my goal I don't want to just."
760.0,Provider,"Take from it. How many minutes 20 minutes half hour 15 pick a number that's that's doable, it has to be your goal Jillian it's not my goal i'm just needs to be concrete, though, something that's an actionable."
18070.0,Patient,"For at least 20 minutes because it'll be like some me time like I don't know just walking and clearing my head or monitoring in a negative way just taking a walk for me like shower thoughts, you know."
760.0,Provider,Okay well we'll put it on the back burner with meetings for now. And we'll talk about it we'll talk about it later. Would you be willing to do some journaling. about all the reasons why sobriety would be. good for you and your life.
18070.0,Patient,yeah.
760.0,Provider,Would that be a goal that you would be willing to do.
18070.0,Patient,Definitely I I love to write actually. That is. One healthy coping skill that. will never be. Better nian. Whenever turn.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so there we go, we have a couple of goals and I again I want to, I want to thank you again for being honest with me about that and so we'll we'll talk again next time how this goes and how this feels and we'll just. Do you mind keeping the focus on your substance use and perhaps you know another goal would be to kind of help you, with your motivation, a little bit."
18070.0,Patient,"and yeah I. Think that's my priority right now okay. Eventually, we can. kind of dive into some things that I truly. need. Some assistance with building or I or outside perspective for me just coping skills. yeah and and little control over. My certain behaviors and dogs whatever."
760.0,Provider,"All right. Okay, well, can we can we schedule our next session Jillian. See. Tuesday February 1 234 or five. Does any of those times work for you."
18070.0,Patient,I.

18070.0,Patient,um well my.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, I just lost Jillian. Trying to schedule her Okay, thank you."
