14005.0,Patient,"um I don't know what I learned I just watched like some beginning steps and like what you need to do to start a collection or. I didn't I didn't know if it was even worth my time like I. watched a couple, and I was like I don't even know if I want to buy anything you gotta buy some stuff, then I was like I don't even know if I really want to enjoy that but something along those lines, I do want to select oh no point."
105.0,Provider,"So stay there, what you may have learned is it's an important one, you may have learned one thing you don't want to do. And you know that, before. that's important you just kicked it off the list and you wouldn't have known you would have always wondered Is this something I want to invest my money in well right now, you don't. that's information that's useful so um did it inspire you to think of something else."
14005.0,Patient,"yeah for sure I got into some other just collecting in general, video that I would walk in and. I think i'm gonna start like something that I like like I don't know if you remember, I pulled that do want like a hobby. yeah but. Like I do enough time for me. So I still need to just figure."
105.0,Provider,"But that's what we're doing. that's coin collecting is a hobby. And that's like that the category is hobby. coin collecting is one of them. Whether it's. Running or fixing cars or painting. yoga or making your own YouTube videos on something. You know, maybe you'll make one on how to discover what your hobby is a first you got to figure out how to do it. Okay."
14005.0,Patient,"guys with my hobby I see a lot of a lot and they get they get crazy about exercising, but I just hate being that tired."
105.0,Provider,I hate being tired oh it's interesting.
14005.0,Patient,"I mean not only hate it but i've tried me my wife, who tried exercising like daily and music I don't think to it at all."
105.0,Provider,"You know a lot of people exercise for a purpose. hmm he adrenaline feeling of it, they have this sense of this particular body muscle development that they want so there's a real sense of Oh, I want to run this five K or want to be a marathon runner they have an awareness of a motivation. So if you don't have it it's not likely to sustain itself. Exactly yeah."
14005.0,Patient,"And then my. Physical stack stack cases all day all day long. A year of law turned away so it's not like. I don't hate my body, these days, without like well, I was my body with better like i'm more bit that i've been in a while so pardon."

14005.0,Patient,"This is a big deal no older. me my wife blah blah, you need to start like a routine or something for sure."
105.0,Provider,"Okay, these might be different things we can talk about exercise in a minute, but this is not a pleasurable hobby for you, this is something else so let's just stay stay here for a second come back to exercise. But something that makes you happy, something that you can get lost in and it's a oftentimes people enjoy the hobby because they're not in their neurotic mind they're not in their worry mind they're not worried about the future they're not stressed."
14005.0,Patient,Exactly okay.
105.0,Provider,"Is that what you want, from a hobby."
14005.0,Patient,For sure yeah I mean yeah.
105.0,Provider,So we've got one thing found out it's not going to be coin collecting.
14005.0,Patient,No.
105.0,Provider,"it's not it's not going to be running. that's progress, what else is on the list that we can keep checking off."
14005.0,Patient,let's see. i'm not very good with my hand so let's let's check off. A building thing I don't know if it has to general.
105.0,Provider,"Oh no let's push to see all right, so not good with hands so."
14005.0,Patient,i'd rather oh no my brother knew how to fix cars and he would pick everybody stuff and i'm I don't feel like i'm very mechanically minded.
105.0,Provider,"Okay, so, but is that is that do you think it might be too general what you just did because a lot of activities, whether it's painting or cooking we're using our hands."
14005.0,Patient,"yeah you're right, I guess, I meant more so. big thing building thing."
105.0,Provider,Okay fixing building alright so. Oh yeah not the fix it and mechanical fixing mechanical maybe okay so machine so you're not interested in taking a part of toaster and putting it back together.
14005.0,Patient,"No i've never been like I said, my brother my brother is older than before he went private show me stuff growing up like how. Are you telling me like you're gonna want to know how to do this stuff and I just wouldn't even I wouldn't be I didn't do it don't even care how many didn't really work so i've never gotten into that."
105.0,Provider,Right. Now Have you taken classes like. Making pottery or a painting or drawing class.
14005.0,Patient,i've never taken a class teach me anything really. That might be something I could try them.
105.0,Provider,"yeah so. um. I don't I don't know y'all area, so my next question is going to have to do with we went to YouTube before because immediately it's, how do we go find out. Young so where can you begin to explore and these would be artistic expressions Okay, they would either you know be. Maybe a painting or drawing class or pottery. were in your Community I don't know, do you want to go to an in person kind of format."
14005.0,Patient,i'm sorry.
105.0,Provider,What do you want to go in person.
14005.0,Patient,To a flat.
105.0,Provider,uh huh.
14005.0,Patient,"yeah I don't know where I live in I live in Florida so it's a pretty small, so there might be a couple out a whole lot of options around here. I got here we go into a Community college and I don't really know."
105.0,Provider,What what's the name of the Community college.
14005.0,Patient,Clovis community.
105.0,Provider,"Okay well that's tricky so maybe that would be your next little step is to go online and see what classes, they offer."
14005.0,Patient,yeah.
105.0,Provider,"I think you haven't done that already i'm not, this is not rocket science, but i'm doing right now, what if you had to answer yourself what do you think kept you from doing it before."
14005.0,Patient,I don't know I guess is lazy. Because I really feel like i'm just done what lady like it's easy for me to sit here and look at my phone in my spare time you know.
105.0,Provider,"We are what are you looking at tell me again, you may have told me but tell me what you're looking at."
14005.0,Patient,don't know YouTube. there's a lot of different channels on YouTube instagram all the time. ready i'm on reddit a lot for a whole bunch of different reasons.
105.0,Provider,"But there might be some interesting things there, so those are the name. So YouTube and read it, but what are you watching, are you watching the same thing that your wife is he watching the same thing as your friends you're watching something you're drawn to something, what are the channels."
14005.0,Patient,"there's this i'm trying. To like is literally something like you know I watch TV I watch people build stuff. Other people that I wish I could do. Like a business channel where there's a lot of stuff with epoxy like they make tables and stuff that. Our staff. Formal guys will like slow down stuff super slow, you can see, really intricate details of stuff that's usually can't see with the human eye, you know what I mean I just watched so many different things and. let's see what else I remember, I remember in group I told you watch another channel called jcs where. They go over interrogations and break down the methods they're using to try to catch the criminal and stuff. A lot of different stuff for sure."
105.0,Provider,"So those three things build stuff slow down, so I can see the stuff how it works and investigation, they all have sort of watching construction, I know you said you don't want to build things or fix things. But there does seem to be a curiosity about how things work."
14005.0,Patient,"yeah, I guess, I guess, so why wouldn't we want to pull in the case of it right yeah I just curious about how stuff works I just like i've tried like when I was little you. Try to like help my friends pick their fix their cars and stuff now just feel so dumb because I don't. grasp that kind of stuff. Okay, I can't say that whole bunch of effort it i'm not gonna sit here and they really truck out there and mess with my car bunch, but I just don't feel like they could do it."
105.0,Provider,"wow. That changes you'll know because there'll be sort of tension, but as far as trying to figure out something that interests you. So you describe yourself as lazy However I didn't hear you say you just watch movies all day long."
14005.0,Patient,know.
105.0,Provider,Which person would be lazy or the one that passively watching the movie or watches how something's built the slow motion of how its put together or how to investigate and find out if someone's lying.
14005.0,Patient,"I mean, I would I would think that either way you're still just sitting there not really accomplished accomplishing very much."
105.0,Provider,"So it's the accomplishment. And when you're at work, do you feel accomplished."
14005.0,Patient,"No. I wouldn't I mean I feel like financially i'm out that you know we're paying i'm paying the bills, I feel that way, but I don't feel like my job fulfilling I don't know, though they do different things they're not."
105.0,Provider,they're relevant they I really do want to know if it's fulfilling.
14005.0,Patient,Okay didn't know.
105.0,Provider,And I do wonder if that has something to do with this flat feeling that you have.
14005.0,Patient,Maybe.
105.0,Provider,You might be bored.
14005.0,Patient,yeah maybe I have my job is pretty repetitive and mundanely.
105.0,Provider,"So. Jay building. Take the investigation, the interrogation stuff, what do you think might be going on there that that's your interest I don't turn that on right, I mean it is unique to you do you do recognize that not everybody's watching what you're watching. You have interests."
14005.0,Patient,Why i'm interested in this stuff I mean.
105.0,Provider,"A bigger question might be where where did these where does the meaning, this is a very big question, but where does the meaning in your life exists where do you find meaning."
14005.0,Patient,Where do I find me.
105.0,Provider,And I n G meaning.
14005.0,Patient,yeah guess. I mean. What What exactly do you mean by meaning like.
105.0,Provider,purpose of your life.
14005.0,Patient,"Oh, I at this point, I honestly think it's just to make sure my kids have the best life possible i'm not just saying."
105.0,Provider,I believe you that's that's common I want them to have the best life possible.
14005.0,Patient,"I grew up pretty. Poor and we didn't do a lot of stuff so i've always wanted to make sure that my kids know have better, like everybody oh."
105.0,Provider,"So you provide them an income, but what about the do stuff. What do you do with them."
14005.0,Patient,"Oh, you go on TRIPS and we can offer before the pandemic more so, but go on TRIPS over to take them to the park my son's in sports, which I never was in. You know, go to gain I would want my three to be involved in more things, but like I said, with the whole focus stuff that hasn't worked out here lately. But just activities with the family, we didn't do a lot of family stuff when I was a kid so make sure we do it together on the weekend. And that will build me for sure when I spend the week, and my son game to whatever we're doing I feel. I feel good about that."
105.0,Provider,"And I think what's. My perspective if. you're able to give it to your son. But you're not able to do it for you. You know, we can plan a trip, you probably asked him what do you want to do for fun, you could say you know what are you interested in and encourage it in him, and maybe celebrate some of his. Whether it's a drawing or something you can celebrate it in him, but you don't seem to have that part, the one that is encouraging of you. Inside of you."
14005.0,Patient,yeah I agree with it.
105.0,Provider,"that's not uncommon for people that didn't have it modeled for them. i'm looking right now, at this website. pulled it up and it talks about. photography animator graphic designer printmaker teacher illustrator. Was there ever a time that you wanted to do something creatively."
14005.0,Patient,"not really. Not anything along those lines, I I was never. I don't anything you asked me I don't ever I don't feel like i'm really good at most things, so I guess anything we go over up call kind of, say, like i'm not good at that, so I was never very interested in I don't really feel like i'm good at a lot of stuff."
105.0,Provider,"I can tell and that's an interesting thing because I don't know, on one hand you weren't exposed to it. And yet you already have this confidence that you're not good at it. yeah So how can this exist if you don't know."
14005.0,Patient,"How do you know what I mean like something like i'm about to tell you. I don't draw very good, which I mean as a kid I have tried to draw and i've realized throughout the years I just can't draw. So, being an illustrator be pumping that because I can't really draw i'm not great with computers, as far as like. You know graphic design or anything that tried to mess around with. And i'm not for great my wife does my computer stuff around it, then."
105.0,Provider,"I just thought of something and same thing you can we know we're just having this discussion sort of brainstorming here. But it started making me think about you, as a coach or as a volunteer in some way what comes up for you when I say those let your mind kind of wander around an idea of being able to coach. And volunteer."
14005.0,Patient,you're saying it like which would I be either or thing.
105.0,Provider,"we're going to start very, very much on first what you do as soon as you heard me say it, what happened when I said it."
14005.0,Patient,"I guess, I read immediately that I probably couldn't be a coach."
105.0,Provider,"You already went to so there's a lot of negativity with you there's I can't. draw I can't fix cars, so I can't I can't I can't I can't."
14005.0,Patient,yeah it's interesting yeah and then we'll bring those.
105.0,Provider,What what makes you think you can't coach and how is it different than being a father.
14005.0,Patient,"I just. I know this is what I bought a immediately I guess it depends on what what coating retirement, oh no I don't think. it's beating myself. yeah I don't know what I would be doing to coach just."
105.0,Provider,"I mean let's let's take the good enough because it's pervasive this judge. You have inside of you about good enough. that's just a book away that's just a class away that's just exposure and experience and education away what's more important is that you find something. That you're interested in not about jumping ahead and already saying it isn't going to work yeah just hit that video button again okay. cool so. we'll put a bit of a pin on the idea that. You have to be at a level of perfection before you've taken the necessary steps. But instead. Just coaching. coaching can mean mentoring, it can mean. Like I said, volunteering. It could be helping."
14005.0,Patient,When you say mentor I do feel like i'm pretty good at giving friends and coworkers advice on certain things. I feel like i'm decent at.
105.0,Provider,touring.
14005.0,Patient,"know the whole, the whole thing with or we can."
105.0,Provider,I much rather hear from you might.
14005.0,Patient,"have been like the the places i've been through like with the my divorce, when I was young, and my son's mom and all that, like if I talk to younger men at work or something and they're kind of going through the same thing i'll kind of give them good advice and things like that."
105.0,Provider,"yeah, and that makes sense, you know when I listened to you, you have a calm sort of methodical personal style you don't seem like you have these big intense sort of emotional reactions, it sounds like you sort of have this balanced way of making decisions, does that seem like that's true."
14005.0,Patient,yeah for sure.
105.0,Provider,And what do you notice your most useful at helping people with what do you most useful helping them.
14005.0,Patient,"thing with. I don't know, I guess, maybe. Being I mean people I guess. people tend to call me when they're upset and i'm at him to make him feel better about thing."
105.0,Provider,You have a calming effect your voice is very soothing.
14005.0,Patient,I appreciate that I feel like you need you.
105.0,Provider,Know it's calming so. Peer mentor. people that are going through a divorce that's one thing you said what else have you been through that maybe other people could benefit from your calm way of handling it.
14005.0,Patient,"I guess just. Trying to be more specific, I don't know like with like, for example, I used to work with this guy and you use a hothead and you would always. Tell me like if i'll be working with him he'd be glad that i'd be with him because he wouldn't fly off the handle a month because i'd be there he'd see how I handle the situation that we were going to. pci and creation and he kind of follow suit and not just blow up on you tell me a bunch of times oh man i'm glad you're there because I would have lost my job I don't know if i'm answering the question but that's what came to mind with that."
105.0,Provider,"Oh well, we're getting there so you're good at let's say communication in potentially conflictual moments at in the workplace."
14005.0,Patient,Maybe yep.
105.0,Provider,And you also were able to very quickly after only one time you took some information on even know what it was that you got for me you applied it and you adjusted it to match your acts and it worked.
14005.0,Patient,It didn't work.
105.0,Provider,So. Do you like helping people.
14005.0,Patient,yeah.
105.0,Provider,"Okay, we found one. Because I didn't hear but i'm not qualified and and I know there's enough evidence that there's some sense of confidence that I can help people I have helped people."
14005.0,Patient,"yeah not only topic here, I immediately think that would be fulfilling. is helping people."
105.0,Provider,"It is, I can tell you from firsthand experience is fulfilling it so is alright so we're onto something so let's scan the environment see what structures are already there doesn't mean it's. plug and play it just means there are other things out that one didn't work that didn't work you've got things like there's a very formal peer mentor program that you can do it could be a peer. And in what domain, it could be substance use it could be someone. people that are going through divorce, it could be children of divorced parents or you know, whatever okay so there's that there's volunteering. With us I don't see why FT may have something of the school system may have something where that's available as of workplace, you may start your own blog online, you may start a not unlike the group that we have that is a male peer support online. and create something that doesn't exist you're looking online you're looking at how to people teach I could teach something I could do something and you're watching this format you're you're already watching it you could create something that maybe someone like you would enjoy watching. what's that make you think of."
14005.0,Patient,You said you said something about did you say something about kids is that what's the SI y amp D that's good.
105.0,Provider,that's good yeah.
14005.0,Patient,I was the real well a kid like me. And so that's good outcome will be.
105.0,Provider,"Okay, so there is i'm not saying this is the answer, but it's a place to start exploring his guardian ad litem. start there go find out what that is guardian ad litem."
14005.0,Patient,i'm sorry that there was more coming up.
105.0,Provider,"it's it's a court ordered. advocate. For a child. And they are singularly an advocate for the child singularly not what the mom wants and the nonsense going on they're not what the dad wants or grandmother whoever, but rather that the focus is purely on the needs of the child. Okay, and they advocate as a child is young, they can't advocate for themselves and so there's this role of very much speaking up with a child can't speak. And and supporting and encouraging nurturing and it comes out of the court system."
14005.0,Patient,Like during cooking.
105.0,Provider,"yeah that's good yeah they're very frequently they are assigned for that now. yeah so so it's in this in this exploration of this could be rewarding. And it might end up being nothing like this. Word guardian ad litem it might be shaped like this, but you can't get there, unless we do these kind of investigations right."
14005.0,Patient,Exactly sorry I get telling my marketers calling me.
105.0,Provider,"it's okay just come right back I do I deal with this all day long so um how you feeling, now that we bumped into something that kind of has your curiosity."
14005.0,Patient,"And you feel good about it, like you said it usually everything super negative about going down this path and maybe there's something."
105.0,Provider,"and think about your spiritual and school things, for example. Churches offer sometimes an avenue for creating groups, they create have this support scenario, you could create one somewhere there or in your Community or through school, you could create a camp."
14005.0,Patient,mm hmm.
105.0,Provider,You see it. yeah it might come from you. Create your own thing.
14005.0,Patient,yeah it's interesting. yeah I have to have to think about that more. uh huh right right anything like them.
105.0,Provider,"Giving back what you've learned, especially through your own struggle. Is oftentimes quite an amazing moment of gratitude, because our suffering or difficulties weren't for nothing we can teach ah there's a way out of this suffering, and we can. Be preventative so that other people don't experience the suffering that we did."
14005.0,Patient,"Especially i'd like to probably help people had it worse than me because I know my wasn't thing you know what I mean, so I know there's people who. I just grew up for with us for patients and that has its own effect where there's kids who have way worse, you know i'm saying they grow up, we were so. For like."
105.0,Provider,i'll tell you I know we want to do that to ourselves and say. Someone that was hit is worse than someone that was poor but be careful and you would learn this through some training. i'm suffering is suffering.
14005.0,Patient,Okay.
105.0,Provider,"yeah we don't want to layer that because when we're sort of judging myself not bad enough, and an eye not deserving to feel bad and we can kind of. put that on another person even a child and say your way isn't justified to suffer it's we got to be really careful what we will we do to ourselves, we can inadvertently and accidentally send a message to someone else you. you're you got no reason to cry Let me give you a reason to cry it's that that that's a problem right, and so we got to be careful not to do that to ourselves, either."
14005.0,Patient,always gets way words that's always kind of been my mentor.
105.0,Provider,"know you had your first lesson. Your first psychology lesson. Okay you're welcome. So yeah um but it gives a hopefully gives you the ability to have compassion for everyone, because. people lose a grandmother, they may have all the money in the world, and they would trade it just to have a grandmother. You know. You can't can't do it we can't measure in grade someone suffering we've got to open our hearts and just seek to understand it and hold space for it. While they move through it."
14005.0,Patient,You know.
105.0,Provider,"mean everything. In everything. So let's back up we've done some pretty intensive i'm looking at where where to go here where would you like to start where, could you begin to look around."
14005.0,Patient,I don't even know. I don't even have any clue. Specifically.
105.0,Provider,"Well then, let's do this, that since I don't i'm not hung up on being right, I am happy that i'm wrong but it's a place to start so right, you would write down i'm going to go online and look at volunteering. Just look at it, because there's organizations, I you know here it's broward county volunteers of America or some such thing so there's we all have this longing for giving back. And volunteering is a great way to do that, so we would look up volunteer opportunities and organized one, and now you know you. You want a background check and want some training you want these things but it's a place to start because you need to get that brain kind of moving and grooving here, and then you could look up what. Your are you. heart affiliated at all with any any church. No Okay, so that might not be a good fit you might look at the school and see if they're looking for volunteers, because sometimes you end up you network with people. And you find out from there, what they're doing what are other people doing Oh, I do this on the weekends, I have, I basically it's a it's a bike mountain biking camp and really yes, we are biking but we spend a lot of time talking and playing games together. And it turns out that they're rewarding part is not only in being able to be physically active but it's also in that downtime when we're talking. You know so just don't get too hung up on it doesn't fit whatever this box is, you may be generating just stay open that the information and may come by just as we did knocking coins off nope that's not it that's not it that's not it that's not it.
