About five months because a full year of losing your license this was last July happen so it's already been like six months, you know what I mean. But hopefully hopefully it gets dropped to a reckless operation and then I just get a ton of points on my license but that's not jail time or fine you know, a couple fines, maybe, but i'd rather have my license."

17251.0,Patient,"I did get rid of the nicotine, though, which is good, I haven't bought innovation, since we last talked. Also haven't drank but that hasn't really that wasn't really a struggle, or anything but I was just like yeah I might as well just not during for the rest of this time, you know."
741.0,Provider,"yeah yes i'm done with nightlife I said i'm done no nightlight for so January because people calling me every weekend like let's go out at night turn everybody I turned everybody guys kicked it at the House like all munson just. Well, you know I mean I hear young and everybody likes to go Party and all of that fun stuff but. The cod it's okay to party, but make sure you have a like a designated driver who doesn't drink. Right, you know um because that way you make it home alive. Exactly and. My. I had a cousin who was killed by a drunk driver and he was jogging on the sidewalk."
17251.0,Patient,"that's crazy yeah. I know and that's. I mean that stuff that stuff came to my mind to like when I was in the hospital, I was like I mean it was I mean it was middle of the night but i'll still like I mean there should have been a kid."
741.0,Provider,"Anybody yeah there's anybody there. To kind of hit a parked car and you would have been a one the hurt you know. I mean yeah that's just is just really i'm right one of my friends in high school. They went there was some friends and they all snuck out and they went for a ride, they will all drinking and there was like five of them squished in a little sports car and then we're driving too fast. And, most of them. survived but one did not. and The ones that were in the vehicle who were injured severely but survived their lives were changed forever. yeah I just it just you know. I don't have room to talk i've got some stupid stuff you know. There were many times when I could not have survived my escapades but um. I don't know. you've already experienced some of the negative consequences. yeah early."
17251.0,Patient,"yeah exactly which I kind of appreciate because, like I just had to change my mentality about it, because when I when I when I got. You know I wasn't like I said before, I wasn't ever somebody who just gets drunk and just drives all the time, but when I did get behind the wheel, though I was like. I can like yeah like I was just like yeah it's. cool yeah and I thought it was almost funny I thought it was almost funny to that I was drunk and I was just driving on the street in my car and now. I i'm it would be embarrassing for me, even if I made it home like it just be embarrassing to be behind the wheel job it's just embarrassing it's sloppy it's just like you know what I mean. i'd rather be you know."
741.0,Provider,"Well, you may have to pay the price you never know. yeah um. I. I was a lot older before the COPs started messing with me, but when I started messing with me there's a mess let's be hard. Right now i'm. I am I did five year well, I actually ended up only doing for years or probation because the judge, because I turned my life around and I started doing. things the right way and started giving back to my community and all that stuff so he left me off a year early, but I was supposed to do, five years of probation and after the first year I was looking at two years. State jail, because I had like five or six dirty ways. So the last two years of my probation I straightened up and flight right."
17251.0,Patient,yeah.
741.0,Provider,"I became a model citizen um and that made a difference in the long run, so. Right."
17251.0,Patient,But exactly.
741.0,Provider,"But that was after I had lived on the street, for two years and lost my kid and you know whole bunch of other really awful stuff."
17251.0,Patient,yeah.
741.0,Provider,"i've had I don't know four or five different times, where i've had guns pointed at my head and. stuff like that, so I know. That lifestyle is not cool."
17251.0,Patient,No right it's not.
741.0,Provider,It really isn't I know that people think it is but it's not.
17251.0,Patient,yeah.
741.0,Provider,And when I look back on it is like really scary and i'm very grateful that I survived.
17251.0,Patient,yeah.
741.0,Provider,"um alright, so you get to go to court and you could possibly get a fine you know, possibly lose your license but there's no possibility of going to jail or anything like that right."
17251.0,Patient,I don't think so. Unless I went into court and was desperate real disrespectful or something you know.
741.0,Provider,"yeah yeah you're not gonna do that right. Okay, and alright so. So what kind of. I don't know I kind of feel compelled, so we need to work on. So the to understand what the disease process looks like. um. it's a process, obviously, and, as it happens, slowly over time. The more you, the more you use the more likely, you have the chance of becoming addicted and it doesn't matter what it is and. A lot of people will tell you that marijuana is not addicting I will tell you that if you have an addictive personality, it is. Right and if you smoke until you are blotto all the time, then you have a problem that's all there is to it, and if you moak and then tend to not take care of your responsibilities like pay your bills or do your chores or whatever it is that you're responsible for. right then that's a problem."
17251.0,Patient,"Right, because people will wake up in the morning and they'll think about these responsibilities, I have and those. All screw that and be like you know what no i'll get to it i'll get to it, but just as a smoke first and then, and then they don't even do it, and then they just they just chillin are acidic."
741.0,Provider,"And exactly exactly and my son was real bad and and. He still smokes today he doesn't believe that he has a problem, but I can tell you that causes problems between him and me. That causes issues between and our relationship. He can't be around me because he can't smoke around me. um. So there's a lot of times when he doesn't want to be around his mom because he'd rather good hi."
17251.0,Patient,Good.
741.0,Provider,"He he. He always he runs the risk of losing custody of his two year old daughter every time you get tired. i'm. Not even that he's like smoking around or anything it's just the fact that he smokes it and it's in his system of CPS ever drug tests him, he would lose custody automatically. um so. there's a lot of drawbacks any job that you go to. Most jobs today drug tests. A drug test before you start the job and frequently they do random tests throughout you know, whenever and. So when they do that. chances of losing your job or really good just for just for smoking marijuana that's crazy huh. yeah so um but the disease, the process that happens is you first you start you start. enjoying using and enjoying your time. and progressively what happens is either you become emotionally or mentally dependent upon it. Or, depending on what it is, if it's alcohol or bentos like xanax or valium or or some of those are heroin you become physically addicted or your body creates pathways that rely on having that medication having right."
17251.0,Patient,You get sick without it.
741.0,Provider,"Exactly i'm. heroin to get off of heroin, it will not kill you, but it is very, very difficult and very painful."
17251.0,Patient,"yeah I heard, I heard it was yeah."
741.0,Provider,yeah as awful as it's not fun every muscle in your body hurts every bone in your body hurts. vomiting diarrhea it's it is really not fun.
17251.0,Patient,"yeah he yeah my my uncle who is like my godfather I was really close with he. He died from heroin and he he was a really good he was a really good guy and he was like a really strong guy and and it and it took and he started in it took them out after him, he will only do it for a month. And it took them out and his brother mother uncle he told me a story one time about he tried like they used to do like they were you know they were crazy back then, but. You know least do like coconut stuff but he he's like yeah I tried heroin one time back in the day and I was and I withdrawal for three days and I told everybody like stay away from this."
741.0,Provider,yeah I mean.
17251.0,Patient,yeah like he.
741.0,Provider,"says, if you use it for any length of time withdrawal is like seven to 10 days."
17251.0,Patient,yeah and he he. He smoked at one time with these. Random Dudes and then he withdrawn and he he in luckily he knew that those were withdrawals that he was experienced you know what I mean. right and it was only one time. But it was still three days of hell.
741.0,Provider,Right yeah.
17251.0,Patient,You know. And I don't even like.
741.0,Provider,"yeah and if you feel all a bad really bad and ben's those like xanax and valium and and and those types of tranquilizer type things those things, if you do not, if you withdraw without medical assistance, you can kill yourself."
17251.0,Patient,"Wait one second I need to get I gotta plug my phone, and so I gotta get some different headphones this. i'm sorry. Can you hear me."
741.0,Provider,yeah I can hear you.
17251.0,Patient,Okay yeah sorry about that. A little bar headphones from my mom.
741.0,Provider,"that's right and we've only got a few more minutes because you were kinda you a little bit date. But i'm gonna try to. See, if I could show you. Good man. I don't know if I can find it. and What kind of addiction is a cycle and what happens is that you used to go okay i'm going to go have fun, so you go you and after a while you're a person with an addiction has kind of like an allergy. And you know what an allergy is right. it's like an unusual reaction to an ordinary substance right. Right well, most people when they have an allergy they avoid that substance, whatever it is like strawberries or peanuts, or whatever well and. A lot of times what happens. Is um. If you have an addiction, you have you put the drug in your body, and you have this unusual reaction that causes you to want more. And more and more and more and not be able to stop right until. Something outside of yourself stops you. And some of the things that happen when you use. You break out in a jail, sale or a divorce or losing custody of your kids are you know running out of money. For some people um. So when that happens i'm not finding it. and When that happens, then we have. feelings of remorse and guilt. After you know when we finally get stopped. And, and all the drugs are out of our system and we're feeling and thinking again, then, we have all this guilt and all these negative feelings well, most people don't enjoy negative feelings. So they start trying to figure out how to get away from them. And, of course, their brain kicks in and says okay yeah I know how to take care of that just one. or this one, make it all, better or you know some kind of lie basically right. And it, and so, then you buy the lie and convince yourself that it's okay to use again, and then you have this allergic reaction and you keep using until something up so you keep going around and around and around on the circle. So treatment is where we step in and try to stop. The cycle. And we stop it in various places we try to stop it, where you get some feelings that that feelings after us. And we try to help you learn to deal with those and we also try to help learn not to buy the lie because it's a lie right. And so those kind that's kind of what that's about, and that is what you i'm. out that's what the process is like. Right so."
17251.0,Patient,make sense to me. Okay yeah.
741.0,Provider,"And I next time. I will go show you like um we have like a process it's it's a upside down bell curve. Of what it's like for recovery. Okay, and what the process looks like with that and what what it entails so i'll share that with you and i'll see if I can find that. I know I have it Oh, I know where it is. I don't think that's under keynote, though. I think it is. my presentation. Okay, no. It is under. Under my. hold on. Okay i'll find that next time as it gets a part of my present one of my. PowerPoint. presentations so i'll pull it out, so that you can see it okay. All right, and we have an appointment for next time."
