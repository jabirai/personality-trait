Because I was so i'm still kind of feeling. Just a little bit down a lot of times. Here so she said that that might help because I had tried before that the zyprexa. And I was really sleepy all the time so that didn't work. So we're trying that now today was the second day I took it I haven't really noticed much of anything yet so hopefully that will help, but overall i'm feeling a lot better. From the Prozac is what i'm thinking so."

11171.0,Patient,"yeah and my doctor was putting me off work for like a couple of weeks, at a time, and so this last time she gave me off through October. So now i'm feeling like wow that feels like a long time, like, I feel like I almost feel like I could go back now but i'm like No, let me keep the time off and make sure i'm ready. I mean it's a good sign that you're like well, maybe I could go back."
226.0,Provider,"And like a time but yeah i'm I, I agree, like just take the time. Like you know, like. Take this time that you need and you. Know let that adderall kick in and."
11171.0,Patient,"yeah I know I was kind of like really afraid to take it. I don't know why i've never been afraid to take anything anyone's prescribed, but I was like."
226.0,Provider,"My son could take meds like these, I could take it. You know that's that's interesting because I had never heard that adderall will just kind of give you that extra kick that's that's good to know."
11171.0,Patient,"Every yeah. I know I was like Oh, maybe that's why I was kind of afraid to have like i've never heard of that."
226.0,Provider,But that's.
11171.0,Patient,"Okay, if you think so. yeah."
226.0,Provider,"So i'm like how is your son, I know that we had talked about that, before like what's. Like what's going on."
11171.0,Patient,"behavior wise he. seems to. kind of be doing a little bit better with like the listening, but he's been doing things like stealing. He stole my sister's I guess it's an I watch or some whatever you call it. Because it was just missing we didn't know where it was the next door neighbor asked if we could grab some packages off of their doorstep and hold for them till they got home. And then, a package was missing he had ended up taking it opening it destroying the evidence and keeping the item. You know, things like that have been going on, so i'm trying to talk to him about that and, like you know what are you doing. What was going to lead you. So he swears that he's not gonna do it anymore, and then he had therapy yesterday with his therapist and I talked to him a lot about. don't just go to therapy and say oh i'm good everything's been fine you know you really need to talk to her, because you know therapists have studied psychology and and you know, maybe she can help you and figure out what's going on and. I kind of talked to him, like that, and so I. eavesdrop a little by the door and I heard him talking about something, and she was like well what happened, why did you do that so it's like okay good. And then I asked him after so do you want to share anything and he's like yeah I told her about the package. was like okay good. cuz I was like you know, maybe she can. get a breakthrough with you because I said, sometimes you know you talk to a therapist like I have and i'm like. Oh that's why i'm doing that or that's why i'm thinking that so."
226.0,Provider,So does he give you any indication as to why he's stealing what's what started.
11171.0,Patient,"The package was I just really wanted to know what was it, it was from Amazon, you know you get good things I just really wanted to know or. Just bored because you guys took all my things we don't have anything to do so, I just needed something to do."
226.0,Provider,what's with the watch with scaling not watch did you.
11171.0,Patient,"Watch was um. I keep asking my teacher at school, what time, it is because the clocks broken and she said, maybe it's time for you to get a watch. And i'm like Okay, but that doesn't mean to take someone else's. You know, maybe you come home and say hey I don't know what time it is right, because he doesn't have his phone or anything because everything's taken away. So I said, but this is going to keep getting you in more trouble right, this should give you incentive to keep doing good and work to get your stuff back."
226.0,Provider,"So what. Okay, so as he was stealing a new started taking like phone away."
11171.0,Patient,know that stuff's been taken away.
226.0,Provider,I would have.
11171.0,Patient,yeah so it's like.
226.0,Provider,I want to know. How long.
11171.0,Patient,"it's been taken away for a while, like a month. Really yeah and you know will like say Okay, you can watch TV today right because he has no TV like everything's taken away, and then I don't know something will happen, it will be like see we allowed you to watch TV and then you go and do something. So."
226.0,Provider,Does he have enough activities to get outside in the seat engaged in sports or anything.
11171.0,Patient,"he's not engaged in anything outside of school it doesn't want to. Know he's been playing outside a lot and stuff with like my niece and nephew they've been coming over a lot. You know, since all of his stuff taken away he doesn't have much else to do, but to play with his little sister or stuff like that so. that's been good. He used to be in baseball like several years ago, but he doesn't want to do anything now. And then. I started thinking like is it friends and like what are you and your friends talk about at school, or are they like this type are they stealing are they doing things like that. And he said no, they just talked about video games and things are not into that i'm like okay."
226.0,Provider,It. Is it getting bullied at school.
11171.0,Patient,"um there was only one incident of that that he told me about his when he forgot his lunch and I had to go take him lunch, so he ate lunch late with the older group and a kid made a comment to him about his glasses, because he recently got glasses. So that's the only instance that i'm aware of, and he doesn't even know who the kid is he hasn't seen him since because they go at different times."
226.0,Provider,Work how old is your son again.
11171.0,Patient,he's in fifth grade he's about to be 11. yeah.
226.0,Provider,So. Does he say why he doesn't want to be in sports or do anything sports wise.
11171.0,Patient,"he's going to be a youtuber does his profession and so he needs to practice that a lot, and he needs to work on that and it's, the only thing that matters."
226.0,Provider,what's he gonna do as a youtuber you know.
11171.0,Patient,He wants to be one of those people that are like talking about video games and not type of thing.
226.0,Provider,Is he allowed to play video games right now. it's a cramp in your style doesn't it.
11171.0,Patient,yeah.
226.0,Provider,"Oh. So you know. It in I kind of wonder too about the whole like not wanting to do sports thing too, I think that might be kind of a residual of Kobe and you know these kids haven't been in organized sports for a while. And I think you know it's like getting out of practice and. yeah not having that available I just like. Really crazy and."
11171.0,Patient,"Then I know he's like at school, he plays basketball during lunch and so he likes to do things I think it's just when he's at home, he would rather. Do the video games and that type of thing so. You know, to try to convince him like let's go do something else is difficult."
226.0,Provider,um What are his grades like what's his schoolwork like.
11171.0,Patient,"He doesn't like to do score so. I was just in a meeting last night they're doing some kind of programs through school it's P IQ he have you heard of it. some kind of program they do at different I don't know they can run a different schools and it's like a six or eight weeks session program for parents to teach you things to help like support your kid to eventually go to college or something like that. And so. They were asking like you know what are some challenges that you see and i'm like my child doesn't enjoy school he doesn't want to go to school, so he does the bare minimum, to get by. Right, so you know, like when you answer a question and. You just write down the red one. Instead of. The girl picked the red one you know you don't do a complete sentence like he's that type of student. So he'll try to do the bare minimum. And i'm like it's not because he's done or he doesn't know he just and i'm like. You gotta try to put more effort in your work. So he's passing he passes things but it's like you know, and they do they're not doing letter grades. Like because the coven thing they changed all that too and it's kind of. Like yeah. Really yeah they're back like this school they're back to a like a 1234. or four is above average and threes average like that."
226.0,Provider,interesting.
11171.0,Patient,So.
226.0,Provider,But he's back in the classroom full time right.
11171.0,Patient,mm hmm yeah.
226.0,Provider,"Is he happy to be back, I mean, even though he doesn't like it to see is he happy to just be."
11171.0,Patient,"yeah yeah first you want to go in the school year started but yeah I think he likes to be around friends and stuff because I haven't had any issue with him saying I don't want to go, or is it you know he gets up and goes."
226.0,Provider,"Okay, and so has that been stressful for you just the behavior the acting out behavior and stuff and stressful for the year and the family."
11171.0,Patient,"yeah yeah. Like you know causes conflict was me and my husband he's a lot more strict than me. yeah and i'm a lot more lenient. yeah so it's like i'm trying to learn to be more strict too, because I know that the way i've been doing it isn't working. yeah but then I think that he's he's too strict. So we're trying to find a middle ground, you know."
226.0,Provider,yeah you know it's like the crime has to you know the punishment has to fit the crime right.
11171.0,Patient,Right yeah.
226.0,Provider,"And, and also the other thing to keep in mind is like consistency really needs to be. You really got to have that consistency, where, if you say, if you do this, this is going to happen."
11171.0,Patient,mm hmm.
226.0,Provider,"And you got to follow through with that. Because if you don't. Then you leave that little space and that space gets bigger and bigger and bigger and then, as they get older they're like well you're not going to do anything because you never have done anything so I don't have consequences so. i'm going to go ahead and do whatever I want to do, because I know that there's not going to be punished."
11171.0,Patient,yeah and that's how i've been. Okay.
226.0,Provider,"So that's what i'm trying to change. Okay yeah so. Actually, what happens when you stay consistent, is it gives kids. It it gives them a sense of security sounds kind of weird but it gives them, it gives them structure so if, like kids that are like environments that don't have like rules or. You know kind of like like guidelines kids feel very out of control. So, then they start acting out of control, but when kids know exactly what to expect when it's very structured and it's routine and it's they know Okay, this is what comes next this is what's going to happen. They feel safe and secure. hmm OK so. The fact that you know you probably feel a little guilty or like can feel kind of bad I don't know you know. Like yeah I don't know on a punish and you know he's so cute you know. By actually doing that and having follow through your keys benefiting. he's and like everybody's benefiting in the long run. Because otherwise. Like especially like teenagers will kick and scream and say no i'm not coming home at midnight, you know, everybody else curfews at two in the morning and i'm coming home at two in the morning you're like no you're not coming home at two coming home at midnight that's your that's your. that's your cookie. Any stick to that because that gives them strength that actually makes them feel safe they'll kick and scream and they'll complain, but it gives them also it gives them an out like if something is kind of. sketchy scary they can say oh now I gotta go home. cookies that new wireless microphones at midnight mm hmm so you know, maybe, maybe looking at it that way, like when you're when you're providing that consistency or providing that structure for her and and you're actually providing safety."
11171.0,Patient,makes him feel.
226.0,Provider,"Safe inside. yeah so you know when you look at and go you're so cute and I just don't want to punish you. I mean that was a clever response with the watch, you know."
11171.0,Patient,I know.
226.0,Provider,"I mean. You know. Rack that elsewhere, like you know use those kind of responses in other areas that will get you what you want that's you know, honest and all that other stuff because you know that's not bad, I gotta tell ya know. So. yeah and then that way to like as you're doing that hopefully that will reduce your stress level around this and you'll start to see results from."
11171.0,Patient,yeah.
226.0,Provider,"yeah and then and then also um you know, maybe talking with the counter and just in haze or something anything you can provide what we can be doing, you know any suggestions around what what you think we can be doing."
11171.0,Patient,Okay yeah.
226.0,Provider,"You know just. You know, obviously not going hey what are you talking about, you know that kind of. Like, how can, how can we. make this work at home. We may be doing."
11171.0,Patient,mm hmm.
226.0,Provider,Okay anything like anything else. Anything else that you want to go over.
11171.0,Patient,"i'm just to update you a little bit on my mom. she's been a little sick she's had some fluid in our lungs and stuff so she's been having some difficulty breathing so i've been going to some appointments and stuff with her and. Her lease. So yeah my sisters are trying to decide what's gonna be the best option for her. Because she's also having some issues with the neighbor there where she's staying but we've we've kind of already been. deciding that she wasn't going to stay there, the plan was probably for her to get a place with my sister that the one that lives here with me now. which they don't get along very well so. i'm trying to debate whether or not I should have her come here and live with us."
226.0,Provider,Let me keep.
11171.0,Patient,"That as an issue. But I feel like i'm spending a lot of time going to do things for her, and you know she's calling for help, and it would make things easier if she were here, but then i'm concerned about you know what. What could happen if she were here so i've talked to my husband about it i've talked to my sister about it and they're open to the idea, my husband's like whatever's easiest for you he's willing to go along with but. i'm just afraid to do it and regret it. So I don't know I know I would have to have a conversation with her. Right like these are the rules if we're going to do this."
226.0,Provider,"yep absolutely. Absolutely, that has to be you know. You know that's the conversation, you should have sooner rather than later, and be really clear with her on the rules, the guidelines in the boundaries. and here's what's going to happen if these aren't followed, and you know I work. I can't be at your beck and call you know i'm here to help you but you know, this is what things are our expectations. And you know but absolutely be very, very clear and very, very firm lovingly firm. about what needs to happen if she were to come in you."
11171.0,Patient,know as.
226.0,Provider,"You don't want that turning into something where you're like on call 24 seven like running around back and forth of them down. right because you're getting to a place like right now, like you're getting to a place where with your medication is finally we got you on the right medication. You know your stress levels coming down, I can see it, I can hear it your depression isn't as prevalent it's not as in the forefront so you're getting on the right track you're just kind of make sure that if this were to happen that you're able to stay on the right track for you. still be there for your mom but not have for. Totally can take control of your life."
11171.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
226.0,Provider,"Think about it talk about it, you know. way all your options."
11171.0,Patient,yeah yeah that's what i've been trying to do me my sister's keeper you know getting together and talking and thinking about it so.
226.0,Provider,"So maybe have some more conversations about it, you know get comfortable with the idea or not comfortable with it like you know really like immerse yourself in it and go Okay, how do I want this to be how is this going to look. How is this going to work."
11171.0,Patient,yeah.
226.0,Provider,that's something to think about. You know Take your time with it.
11171.0,Patient,Like how much.
226.0,Provider,How much time do you have before you have to make that decision.
11171.0,Patient,"Oh, she her lisa's up the end of October. So. fairly soon. um but you know we were thinking also, we can also say you know we haven't found another place for you, so why don't you just come stay here while we keep looking. And then it kind of like a test run you know. I like that so."
226.0,Provider,yeah I like that a lot mm hmm.
11171.0,Patient,"Then she doesn't know that it could be permanent, you know but. And then we can be like, oh no this ain't working."
226.0,Provider,"You know I love that because you're not committing to yeah sure you can stay here. You know right but you're not obviously you can you know. Yes, that's a good plan, I like that a lot. Right, so why don't we rescheduled for a couple weeks. Okay do Wednesdays work for you."
11171.0,Patient,yeah wednesday's are good.
