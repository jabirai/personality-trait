14592.0,Patient,"um I don't know and I lost weight, but I don't know, like the reason behind it, I feel like it may have been like my eating habits changed for a while."
214.0,Provider,"And when you say the change, why did they change."
14592.0,Patient,"um I guess like for like in December was because I would just be in a room, because I was afraid to go out because. Some people in my household record positive. And until that kind of changed, so I would only like twice a day before. I would eat more and then like sometimes like. I just um and like not baked into the lake where I have anxiety attacks I tend not to eat until like I have come down from anxiety attacks happened to yeah."
214.0,Provider,"Right, so I can Okay, so I can see why that's disruptive i'm just asking questions to don't think that i'm like being intrusive in this. questionnaire when you fill that out, it says, are you in a relationship and you said yes and before you said no."
14592.0,Patient,"Yes, we broke up about two weeks oh."
214.0,Provider,What do you think that was about.
14592.0,Patient,"as well, the main reason he broke up with me was because he said he can't handle my anxiety like he can be with me regarding that."
214.0,Provider,Do you think your anxiety is that bad.
14592.0,Patient,"um. I would say it's a it's bad, but like i'm like how I mentioned to him, like it's like I know like he has boundaries and stuff, so I would always ask him to let me know and stuff but he never. He would do things to help me, but then like complain about it or be like Oh, like, I have to do this, but I am like I would ask them to set boundaries, if he can, or like let me know hey I can't do that for say no. So, like for me that comes through able to do things for myself and stuff but I know, sometimes like oh last question or stuff like that that can be. Like say if I feel like someone hit me with their shoe or something i'll ask and stuff like that I feel like it's it's bad, to some extent, because I have to ask questions."
214.0,Provider,"Okay, so if I were to ask you this question just just just go with it from home because I want to show you something. Do you think your anxiety and depression or high."
14592.0,Patient,anxiety yes.
214.0,Provider,"So i'm going to show you something okay. So this is your survey. And, and I often use this so so people i'm working with can see maybe what we're thinking isn't really that catastrophic that high right. So if you can see this as you. write your name. You filled this out and the gab. Is a an anxiety. Measuring tool right says your anxieties at six. it's same you just meet the market for mild do you think that's accurate, or do you feel it's more like severe."
14592.0,Patient,"For depression, I feel like it's it's it's that like mild words like I don't feel like I have it, but I know like. As when I was talking to like my therapist like did to my anxiety like I might have like symptoms correlated to depression so. My last motivation stuff like that. Which are depression system."
214.0,Provider,"But your score for your anxieties only a six. it's very mild so I don't know if you think it's more than it is like where I mean for lack of better words were feeding into it, but the test says this is really a mild case, but when I hear you talk it's almost like it's an extreme case. yeah do you think you're making a catastrophic or do you think you're gauging it correctly."
14592.0,Patient,I feel like it's just more like of a. When I talked about it it's um it's more detailed compared to like a question. questionnaire as.
214.0,Provider,it's very good.
14592.0,Patient,I feel like sometimes questions that are asked aren't aren't me or they're like.
214.0,Provider,Are we good.
14592.0,Patient,Are they don't cover everything.
214.0,Provider,"Right they're not they're not specific enough to what one person may be going through. So it's it's right that's that's very good that you observed that I have a lot of people tell me okay so that's great, but let me tell you really what goes on in the day. Right and that this this question here is just basically I think it's. One of three answers all the time, some of the time, none of the time something like that so anyway it's a good reflection. When do you think that this began to like stomach Lee. Be more overwhelming."
14592.0,Patient,"I have to go back where it was like i'm when i'm. A committed home so like when there was code positive people at home, I feel like that's when it hit and I got like more. Aware of everything, because I feel like before like I would be aware, and like oh haven't it over things and stuff but it wasn't like I would still be able to go out like to the doctor or like. To stuff like that, and now I feel like I can't even do that."
214.0,Provider,"Okay, fair enough. So I think one of the things that it i'd like to be able to work with you on. Is what we call self regulation so. I know, everybody does breathing techniques, but like there were there are more beneficial breathing techniques that deal would like to Vegas nerve the diaphragm. There are other techniques to manage it before it gets out of control and manage the looping thoughts I think if we can work on managing that so like when we start to feel a Come on, we do these practices, so we can level it out, instead of it getting to like what they call a panic attack. Because once the panic attack comes there's nothing that can be done it's really it's already manifested it's already launched there's no way to put a cap on it even medications. want a system to panic attack because, by the time is the medication goes through the system it's way too late. So I think you're open to something like that. yeah okay great so let me take another look. So you're supposed to so are you going to stay with your outside therapists."
14592.0,Patient,"Now, yes."
214.0,Provider,"Alright, so. Is there a release of information which outside outside therapists."
14592.0,Patient,"Yes, I had to talk to them, because I know they mentioned that it's just a paper, I would have to fill out."
214.0,Provider,right but it isn't ruben is it.
14592.0,Patient,Sorry.
214.0,Provider,So there's a reuben s cast BA here that's not your therapist right.
14592.0,Patient,No that's my main position.
214.0,Provider,"Okay, fine, so what i'd like to do if it's okay with you and I respect that you want to do it, but we have to give verbal confirmation. whoever's working with you so i'm going to notify the back office that they got to contact you to fill out another release and you put that person's name down and all i'm going to ask them is to verbally verify the treating you, and then you don't need to see me as a therapist. You won't be able to see to insurance won't cover two therapists and I want to support you and what you need to do for yourself. Okay, and you're supposed to attend groups weekly Is that correct. Yes, alright, so let me see what group you're in my group nope you know my group okay so basically i'll pass this communication on. To Sharon once we get the release of information, I see it in there i'm just going to call him or her up. and say, can you just tell me if you're treating her I don't ask any other questions in that they say yes, then I go back into chart and I fixed it up, so you don't have to worry about seeing somebody in Bray hi other than Sharon."
14592.0,Patient,Okay.
214.0,Provider,"Is that good. Alright, so I don't know I don't know you know i'm not saying your therapist doesn't know what he or she is doing, but you may want to get. I mean you have some time on your hands, you should research Vegas Vegas breathing not like in Las Vegas. it's the Vegas nerve and see if he can help you work through some of those practices, because. I want to tell you confidently that those exercises work extremely well for the people will have high anxiety. or some forms that look like the turning into OCD they really help them manage So if you wanted to pass that information you could i'm not saying he or she doesn't know what they're doing. But regular breathing isn't enough, you need to go really into the systems body and how it works, so it could benefit you okay."
14592.0,Patient,Okay sounds good.
214.0,Provider,"I will listen, it was much of a pleasure with you, I wish you all the best and again they're going to send you a release and then we're going to do a verbal confirmation that you've been treating outside."
14592.0,Patient,"Okay sounds good, thank you."
214.0,Provider,Are you have a great day bye bye.
