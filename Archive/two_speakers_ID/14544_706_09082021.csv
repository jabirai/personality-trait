706.0,Provider,and during that time were you using other things besides heroin.
14544.0,Patient,"I mean the marijuana alleys and then you know, often on like the cocaine crack. not really it really wasn't ever really like I wouldn't do unless I had the heroin basically no okay. So I was never really like dependent on that. Just recently, on my surgeon like I tried to methamphetamine or whatever. Like maybe six months ago. It was basically to help me like when I couldn't get suboxone. And it made me feel better I mean we have energy. You know, it was a it's a little bit cheaper than finding like you know suboxone on the street and her in they're hard to find it that you know now people. sell on they take them like they're supposed to. yeah yeah."
706.0,Provider,"So what about um. So do you do you feel like. from six months ago, until now, do you feel like you've developed a dependence."

14544.0,Patient,"um no. Not not my youngest daughter. She hasn't ever been diagnosed or anything but she has had some issues like with like. behavior at school and stuff where when she was younger, as you weren't you were fight to go to school, so she did end up going to counseling but they never like diagnosed with anything yet. They wanted like it was like a mouth, maybe like a mouse get a piece of ADHD. English they wanted to get her medication, but I didn't want to do that because. addictions and on her mom and her mom and dad and I don't want her to feel like she's going to be dependent on anything at such a young age at that you know uh huh but she seems to be you know was maturity and she seems to be doing a little better so. Ensure that that she knows it okay."
706.0,Provider,um.
14544.0,Patient,"Well, depending on where i'm at. If i'm home with my kids. and I like a five. Because there's a lot of is me my sister she has four kids I have two kids that live here my oldest daughter's has her own house, but so there's a six kids so it's a little stressful at times. But normal like normal day I would say, probably about four or five okay."
706.0,Provider,"um, what do you feel are your major stressors."
14544.0,Patient,"Well, up until this you know I got the doctor was basically stressing if I was even if I was going to be able to find us have accent or were any money for it and how that went now. My stress will actually probably went down some because of a lot i'm sure. Now it's just stressing over my you know financially. My car, I have a car, but it's it's messed up right now so. I don't have the money to fix that. Like my own my own house that's another big strategy for me and employment those three things which are all hand in hand. So yeah."
706.0,Provider,So some financial issues.
14544.0,Patient,kind of stemming from the unemployment and not having a car. I can't hear you. I can't hear ya. hey there yeah I was a I can't area.
706.0,Provider,yeah no I just kind of froze up for a second and so um you have that excellent coping skill of painting so. Man should. Definitely relieve some of those stressors.
14544.0,Patient,until he dies.
706.0,Provider,"You know, get them lined up. Because you have a felony obviously employment is a little bit more challenging. Also, schooling is more challenging do you have a workforce development kind of Center around you."
14544.0,Patient,They like it like the job store.
706.0,Provider,"or something yeah yeah kind of so like if, when you file for unemployment, they have like workforce development that you have to go to to like file your unemployment or they can meet with people."
14544.0,Patient,"um the i'm sure they probably do I live, I live in a little town is actually like a village. or so, but in the like the county like where the county stuff is that it's about 2025 minutes for for me Okay, but i'm sure they probably do there yeah okay."
706.0,Provider,"So I would recommend contacting them and seeing if there's a book a VOC rehab vocational rehabilitation and vocational rehabilitation specializes in people that have barriers to employment, so people that have substance use mental health issues criminal backgrounds physical disabilities. You know intellectual disabilities. And they help them find employment and then sustain it. It might be a good resource for you to be able to find some employers that would be willing to kind of like give you that second chance. They also help with schooling and funding for schooling."
14544.0,Patient,So.
706.0,Provider,Definitely somebody some something to look into. If you are having struggles figuring that out when we meet for therapy that first time we can look at some resources and. help you identify some people that you can talk to. How would you say your self esteem is on a daily basis.
14544.0,Patient,"it's pretty good. This is always no one's anyway, you. Know i'm my own worst critic but at the same time I don't. I don't feel bad about me, I mean I feel. If anything. disappointed in myself, I will, if anything."
706.0,Provider,So typically with anybody that has a substance use disorder. Whether they're active or in remission there's a guilt and shame.
14544.0,Patient,Just because things that.
706.0,Provider,have happened that people you've heard things like that.
14544.0,Patient,that's a big.
706.0,Provider,"yeah those are pretty normal feelings, but you'd say your self esteem, you know pretty decent."
14544.0,Patient,and other than that forever yeah and then yeah was shame and guilt basically.
706.0,Provider,"yeah yeah so and those are all things that will work through in therapy will really kind of dive into those and gain some insight and kind of. You know, look at you know kind of processing through those feelings. And then you should slowly start to see. Some of that just dissipate and go away. Which is going to help you, you know."
14544.0,Patient,"Can you hear me. Oh no I can't I can't. hear you Oh, is it my phone is doing there because it's kind of a the town, I live in it so it'll I had bad reception."
706.0,Provider,"yeah yeah no that's that's completely understand well, sometimes it just zoom to because, depending on how many people are using zoom Canada. Especially now, with the pandemic and everything."
14544.0,Patient,Like oh yeah. Oh.
706.0,Provider,"um but um what I was saying is, you know as you process through all that kind of that guilt machine it's going to help you to look at yourself in a better bite. it's going to help give you more of that strength perspective, so we can focus on the positive things in the moving forward rather than looking backwards. And those are all things that we can work on in therapy as well okay. Do you have any questions for me."
14544.0,Patient,No okay.
706.0,Provider,So we are finished with the bps.
14544.0,Patient,"So if you want to have any questions, we can go ahead and end the session."
706.0,Provider,Do you have appointment set up moving forward for therapy.
14544.0,Patient,"i'm not sure next appointment, I know other than my other than group is every Tuesday and then I have an appointment September 30. And I think that is with Dr so."
706.0,Provider,"Okay, so what you want to do is going to hold a virtual clinic and set up some therapy appointments."
14544.0,Patient,you're probably on twice a month.
706.0,Provider,So just have them set you up some appointments and then we can start our therapy.
14544.0,Patient,"And, as with you right yes okay so call them instead of birth twice a month. alright. sounds good."
706.0,Provider,"All right, well, I will see you when group on Tuesday."
14544.0,Patient,"All right, we'll have a good day."
706.0,Provider,yep YouTube take care.
