416.0,Provider,"i'm doing well, how are you."
14352.0,Patient,i'm doing a lot better.
416.0,Provider,i'm not as romantic anymore.
14352.0,Patient,"I haven't been as manic anymore, the only time that i've been a little bit mad because, like when I see like my family and I haven't seen them in a while and our to be. Like okay we're doing calm down and, like, I just have a lot to say so that's why. But other than mean manic I just been a little bit depressed, I think, just because starting up a new house and everything it's like unpacking and just overwhelming a little bit, but other than that, like i've been doing really well."
416.0,Provider,Okay. yeah glad to hear that.
14352.0,Patient,yeah any.
416.0,Provider,Any any deep lows.
14352.0,Patient,"not really like I said last time and i'm going. To press I sleep a little bit more so saving sleeping in a little bit more, other than that my boyfriend has been really trying to like give me up and going. I think, just because starting somewhere new again, and you know it's really exciting it's just like i'm packing is over. And just trying to like to settle into like a new place. But other than that, I also know, working on the mindfulness like when I do my makeup I tried to like build the brush on my light skin and like like you said, like the eating and everything. stay in the present so makeup husband helping me and then also to just kind of kind of like working out with dancing it out at the same time, because i've done I don't dance so that's what i've been doing as well to stay like present. something better right yeah."
416.0,Provider,How about just breathing just sitting and breathing is not helping at all.
14352.0,Patient,"It does, I like one sometimes when i'm watching something like I get on even watching something, but sometimes they don't pay attention to your breathing and I just kind of like. You know I mean not that I don't breathe, but I do notice that breathing does help a lot and that's something that I didn't do before and actually that is like a mechanism that like. My boyfriend tells me to do like if you're hearing some ages breathe it's OK OK, and just kind of you know, following that everything. yeah."
416.0,Provider,"Okay, and then. I think we had also talked about kidding like doing little things at a time like breaking things."
14352.0,Patient,"yeah, for example, i'm like I would do like when we moved and, like, I would just put a put clothes away or something walk in closet now, which is really big so it's really big so just like put clothes away fold the clothes. Little things like brushing my teeth I just trying to get in that routine again or add a new place, because then I was at my boyfriend's and uncle's House like you know different house different routine and stuff. So, now that i'm here as they get used to like this, I don't know structure ever that, like the House and everything to get up and then now that i've been here for about a week it's been kicking in like yesterday I got up. I decided to put like makeup on and like flashes like I love lashes and then I did laundry we went out to eat like I like seeing like the fruit man like in the valley, so I like to eat fruit that was fun and then. We got a hawaiian hot chicken, which is like the chicken sandwiches and then, so I had something to eat, and then we went to storage to get more stuff so i'm just kind of staying. focused and he was like what do you want to do so, I really just want to like keep busy if that makes sense, so that way i'm not thinking too much. So after that yeah and then after that we ended up coming back here and like I said I was doing the laundry and then to I started watching the voice, like the new. The new one, so I had something to like escape to because whenever something to watch like I have something like look forward to not necessarily like. TV sometimes or two, but I like engaging and like like liking, to know what happens next like that's just like my thing like when I start a show like I can't stop watching it. Until I know what happens so that's another way, I tried to actually stay in the moment but to keep my keep my mind occupied if that makes sense."
416.0,Provider,yeah great.
14352.0,Patient,So that's up to you.
416.0,Provider,"Okay, well, it sounds like some of that stuff's really helping."
14352.0,Patient,"Yes, oh, and I forgot to mention my provider said to to download and move out I don't know if I mentioned that last time, but I."
416.0,Provider,want to work on that too.
14352.0,Patient,"Okay yeah track your mood. Yes, and she said that journaling was good, but at least have an APP and it's funny because when I was at my uncle's house one of. Its I guess she's like my aunt and away his wife sister she also download a mood APP and she actually gave me a better one it's called the moon and and actually does say like. Have you having a psychotic features today like I had this other mood APP that was pretty Okay, but I always was just like doing good, so it was good, but the other options to be more helpful just because it's more specified if that makes sense, so I like eating foods. Oh yeah I does track that."
416.0,Provider,As well when when do you start tracking it.
14352.0,Patient,"I said tracking it about I think two weeks ago, when I had my provider like session and she's like Okay, because I wanted to go down to one mood stabilizer at night, just because the seroquel seems to knock me out so when I take it, I just feel Okay, and then I literally knocked out. Shortly after that, so I went down to one mood stabilizer at night so about two weeks ago excusing I started the. mood APP and I was pretty bad option, because I was in a routine so, then I moved over here, which I love it I do love it over here just getting back into new chain with the new structure of the House if that makes any sense."
416.0,Provider,"When I hear more so going back going back to your tracking. Are you. Are you what are you noticing, are you noticing ups and downs, or what are you noticing."
14352.0,Patient,"A little bit i'm going to start attracting I was actually doing pretty good, but as a couple of days ago I felt like I was getting a little bit surprised i'm not as manic anymore i'm more getting down to. Like the pressure, but it's not severe or anything I think it's just not overthinking a little bit of just thinking about the past, or like the future like I mentioned, and I try not to. get into that and also to like. I don't know i've been thinking about my family a lot because we're all separated like literally like i'm the only one that lives in California and then my uncle a couple cousins look here and then my mom lives in indiana. And then my brother and my sister and I don't live in indiana and then my brother actually moved to Georgia so it's like it's getting new and getting. used to new changes like that, and it kind of is that sometimes we don't have your family, so I could just you know I feel like there are also good like. route to be grounded with but like they're not here and i'm trying to inform you that, because my mom like we kind of gone to the fight when she was here back in August, like, I mentioned the beginning of September. But we're okay so like she did text me today, but I haven't texted back yet. But I just I don't know that's like I think one thing that's bringing down a little bit and then to when we have been like the tight circle of friends. I don't like having a lot of friends like you know i'd like to keep our circle small. And they are like busy doing things and, of course, like working, and you know going to school i'm like I want to go back to school, but then I. don't want to like do things on my own and like freelance and awakes I really want to do like Fashion Design, that I have so many like things that I want to do, but it's just like me the being stuck is just like my problem right now."
416.0,Provider,you're feeling kind of stock. you're missing you're nailing. Okay. yeah So what are some I know that you've been having some negative thoughts and one of the things that we do I mean so negative thoughts are normal everybody has them. The healthy way to respond to them is to first notice them. Right. notice that that's what's bringing you down and then breathe take a few breaths.
14352.0,Patient,write.
416.0,Provider,"A press like call you know calm down. And then just start challenging those thoughts. yeah so thinking back on some of these negative thoughts are there are there ways, you can think of that you might be able to challenge, some of them."
14352.0,Patient,"Maybe we drawing them out. Like maybe drawing what I feel in a way it's I was drawing on like the iPad a little bit that's really cool this procreate which is nice. So sometimes it just draws it out for you and there's different designs on there that makes me feel happy and then also to just drawing on regular pen and pencil and also just writing. My feelings out of this I get him out of my head, I actually saw this take talk saying that you should write like. positive things about yourself for like seven minutes, and then it was actually really interesting you write a good things for seven minutes, and then you. record it and you obviously read off the paper and you start falling in love with your voice, which I thought was really interesting, so I was like. i'm gonna try that which I haven't done it yet, but I saw it, I was like that's that's good, so I wanted to do that and then also the other tick tock saying. You should when you're in a mood think about it for 90 seconds and I just love so because, when you mean or segment emotion. And then 90 seconds, so when you get more than 90 seconds and not becomes your mood and then it just kind of like you know you get stuck and stuff so I also want to try that which I just thought of it right now so."
416.0,Provider,i'm really great.
14352.0,Patient,"Yes, yes that's what I want to do, and then see how that works and stuff so I just I literally just saw them yesterday."
416.0,Provider,"Another another option, so I love I love the suggestions, who would have kept so many great. So definitely I love those also. And I think just providing some counter statements right some some positive statements to your negative thoughts so being able to tell yourself something like. Like my thoughts, my thoughts are not always accurate. or or This is just not helpful these thoughts are not helping my mood or. or a counter statement like yeah my parents are you know my family is a little farther away now but. But really they're just a quick plane ride away, and I can talk to them anytime I want on face. Right or just. Whatever it is that kind of counters that those negative thoughts because it's negative thoughts, as you know, can just kind of spin out of control."
14352.0,Patient,"Yes, I don't like two days like I want to get a thought like I just like run with it i'm like no rosie like don't do that. As a no don't do that, like it's not true because your brain tries to like think that's true and it's no."
416.0,Provider,"Well, I mean that's another great counter Stephen yes exactly what you're saying, right now, too, is like my brain. My brain plays tricks on me, my thoughts don't always have to be I don't always have to think of them as totally true right."
14352.0,Patient,Right okay.
416.0,Provider,Just because i'm thinking it doesn't mean it's true.
14352.0,Patient,"Right and i'm sorry I forgot what I learned in group therapy. Robin is called I think it's like cognitive thinking like when your emotions, you always feel like you're right. And that was a problem with me like I always when I ran with something i'm like i'm right, I never was like i'm right i'm right, but like if it's. Like I got like little pieces of evidence and i'm like i'm right and then my friend actually told me. Well yeah like you could think that but it's not true, like you, don't have hard evidence actually think that's true and I was like. Okay, like yeah you're right and she's been going to therapy for a while, so she also like has helped me and I never been through therapy before so like learning all these new things i've actually helped me and especially. talking to her and she's like my day one really helps as well, like just because you have little things doesn't mean it's right i'm like okay."
416.0,Provider,And even if you are convinced they're true.
14352.0,Patient,they're also not helpful so sometimes when when I have a negative thought and I can't convince myself that negative thought isn't true.
416.0,Provider,"i'll just say you know what Julie, it may be true, it may not be i'm not going to worry about that right now. But I gay, but this is not helping me get through today."
14352.0,Patient,"Right okay and that's what i've been trying to like lean on a little bit like you know just just just be in the moment and that's what i've been trying to do and yeah I think just being a little bit like depressed like I mentioned it's just like he could so yeah yeah. stuff so yeah days like i've never gone through this before and it's hard to get sometimes like some days I don't I don't need I don't need their battle need to do this, but I love talking to you because you're the one that really knows what's going on with me and. it's just like like one day i'm doing good and then the next day is just like so bad emotionally and i'm just like why, like, I was doing so good, like why and like I have been taking my medication and everything and it's just like I don't know like I always think it's like I don't know."
416.0,Provider,"yeah so what happens, let me explain this to. What happens is that, over time, especially when you have a chemical imbalance in your brain like you do. And over time, your brain figures out how to adapt. Right and when you have a chemical imbalance and you have life circumstances that come up you do your best to get through them and sometimes the way that we adapt to those things as children don't function well for us as adults. yeah right so. um so, then we are left with these behavior patterns that that don't work well for us. So what happens in our brain when we do, that is when we have a behavior that we that we do over and over and over again, a habit or a or a pattern to response to something our brain chemicals actually form, I always think of it as driving on a road in the winter time."
14352.0,Patient,Right driving on a dirt road in the wintertime.
416.0,Provider,"So this is kind of what our brain does. You know, when you drive on a wet road in the wintertime over and same road over and over and over again, every day. The road gets routed. Right, it says deep breaths."
14352.0,Patient,yeah.
416.0,Provider,And it's really hard to drive your. tires out of those threats right your tires naturally get stuck in those rats.
14352.0,Patient,way okay.
416.0,Provider,"And then, so what happens and that's how our brain works too, so the more we repeated behavior the stronger those connections are in our brain. So when we are able to think differently or behave a little bit differently, and this is cognitive behavioral therapy at its finest when we think differently or we behave differently it's pulling us out of those ruts and it's putting us on a nice fresh road. So, every time we every time we do something differently, we find a new path and literally new connections in our brains get made. And the more we repeat those behaviors, which is why i'm having you do mindfulness every day. Yes, some more you repeat those behaviors the easier, they are defined, then those become your roads, instead of the nasty rutted road that you don't want to go back to."
14352.0,Patient,"You okay yeah that makes a lot of sense, because I feel like my past behaviors I would literally just. And I worked, since I was like 18 so not that you know it's bad thing or anything but it's ready for life was like. School work, I think, being in school also helped me a lot, I was in a routine like I was in college like that help because I was doing something, but my over when I would always overthink something. else like I would literally just go home and just watch like TV and that's like my That was my bad habit of just like just escaping and not really trying to get into that new road. And now that like i'm not working, and then going to that new road it's like what am I doing. Inside no I also had a little depressed because I was supposed to go back to work, technically, this Monday, but. I just couldn't do it like just thinking about that also made me depressed and there's like I don't want to go back there like I really don't want to now like. it's just too much at a time considering our work at a call Center so like that also to playing out this week, just like didn't help my mind either. So definitely trying to get into lot new road i'm trying to like not think about it so negative we when I can find like a different job that i'd like more or something like that you know so yeah."
416.0,Provider,"So I love that I love the way you about this, the you were you mentioned earlier that you're settling into this new sort of routine what. Does that routine like."
14352.0,Patient,"and your arm, you know. What I wake up like I said i'm sleeping and a little bit more than a boyfriend actually wakes up and i'll take my pill, and then like. I do it on my own to, but some days i'll sleep in the day bye. And i'll take my coat and then, like all like way down and then also going to go back to sleep again, but then i'm like yesterday I was like no I don't do I, like get up and like do your makeup so I didn't make up yesterday and then like I said we just try to do things. On violently like going out like too much too, like, I know, like big places sometimes when I feel like social anxiety, but then again like i'm like no it's fine. I know it's just like I don't know what's going on, I feel like just like work that exciting. Work emails that are you coming back that built that just like flipped me like I was like I don't know what to do and then also to I had to contact case managers and stuff and I didn't know it took like. 15 days i'm like oh my God like i'm going to be late giving this paperwork, I need an extended release and then to like getting disability from this day like I got a deposit. Yesterday, and it wasn't my fault deposits and I have to think about like disability and stuff I got the money you know, but I also want to try to get a job, but then again if I get a job, like. I thought i'll just like go down again like I just don't know what to do, like that type of feel so stuck I just don't know. You know, and I, and I want to go back to her, but I just feel like i'm not ready mentally and like i'm halfway there like i'm not at the halfway point because I was manic you know August September, so I don't. want to go back to work, and then we were reading it, or something and wanting to be or something I don't know. it's just like a lot of little things like that."
416.0,Provider,"Okay, so again. you're spinning off so one thing at a time."
14352.0,Patient,Okay.
416.0,Provider,"What time you're thinking can we had about like what if what if what if I don't know, maybe."
14352.0,Patient,"not my problem, and then to like my birth and say don't stress like it's okay. And I that's what i'm like Okay, and like over the weekend thought that happened and I just feel like I just started to spiral thought and. i'm trying to not think about it, to manage and. One of the case managers did email me, so I have to get back to that so i'll just try to stay in the moment with what's going on. So."
416.0,Provider,"In the moment and take things one thing at a time, as they come."
14352.0,Patient,"Okay yeah. Okay, and be mindful of our podcasts i'm feeling something. yeah so. that's really."
416.0,Provider,Okay. yeah so what's your homework for this week.
14352.0,Patient,"what's today, Tuesday, so i'm. i'm going to keep practicing where mindfulness like like you said, the eating when really helps because, like you're eating and like you can really just focus on the eating and i'm going to try doing my makeup a little bit more. Lately, when i'm back in August September and before that I barely did my makeup because work I just didn't care, so I want to try doing that i'm going to wear makeup I feel pretty you know who doesn't feel pretty motivated so i'm going to try doing that and. Maybe just play with my cat so a little bit more he's very in front of me so he's nice to look. So my tab and then to like I want to start working out again, or at least trying to do a little bit of that and I want to start walking again. I did use a treadmill out my boyfriend and of course there's no treadmill here, so I want to start going outside more. To you, when I get to new area I don't like going outside just don't know what the neighbors are like and stuff like that which it shouldn't matter but it's just my mind, so I want to size, I think those are a few things I really want to work on into my routine."
416.0,Provider,"Okay, and so I love all that that's all kind of connected to mindfulness and then yeah. we're gonna add in i'm working on identifying those negative thoughts. and pushing back against them. Okay yeah."
14352.0,Patient,identify the negative thoughts okay.
416.0,Provider,and taking things one step at a time.
14352.0,Patient,One step at a time. yeah yeah.
416.0,Provider,That all sounds doable.
14352.0,Patient,"No, I don't sound doable definitely I feel like to sometimes being like you know in front of you or other people I start spinning off and I shouldn't do that."
416.0,Provider,Because i'm sorry no it's okay.
14352.0,Patient,"so fast yeah I don't know like I just like i'm used to talking so fast, or like. When i'm with my friends, I feel like before I was really egotistical, I guess, and I really stripped out aware and trying to strip that away so now that I don't have. Like my ego in the way with like those negative thoughts and everything is new person is like whoa like weren't my brain at least like what's going on, so what you explained earlier, so yeah."
416.0,Provider,"yeah. Working on getting into those new patterns, though."
14352.0,Patient,"Yes, i'm gonna think about it that way that's a really good way to think about it so i'm going to think about the dirt road."
416.0,Provider,that's my favorite way to think about it.
14352.0,Patient,"Just provide such an image right. It does, and it reminds me of just like I don't know I just have this image in my head, who also to what I wanted to mention was subconsciously I think are those dreams, but I tell you, and last night, like, I had a nightmare and. It was like a tsunami nightmare and it's weird because, like I literally feel like it's real, even though it's not to do my dream, but like, how can I obviously you can't be here out with dreams, but I don't know I just. been having a lot of nightmares lately I don't know why I don't."
416.0,Provider,Tell me a little bit about your dream from last night.
14352.0,Patient,"So last night, it was like the beach, and I saw the waves coming like towards me and there's a lot of people there and I really can't make out the people that you just feel it. And I just remember looking at it and I was like oh my God like there's like a tsunami coming, and we all started running away, and then I ended up like in this weird room like it seems like a. I didn't know how to explain it like it was like some weird dark room and then, when I opened up this door there was like someone there and I got scared and I started running away. And I don't know I went back to the waves again, and then I woke up and like I told you like, I always dream lot or and it really scares me like. I used to go to the beach all the time, like all the time and I we started doing elementary school and I love the beach like it's one of my favorite places to go, but when I think of bodies of water it freaks me out. So I think going through this change and nightmare depressive thoughts and I negative thoughts I feel like that, like interprets like water into my dream and then I get. I don't know I just get really scared and I into like when I used to smoke weed so I don't smoke weed right now, because of everything, but as an ad smell like I used to not have dreams. At all like, sometimes it just you know I don't know you just don't remember it and sometimes I would have nightmares but i'd be every once in a while, but now that like I don't smoke anymore I just feel like they're more vivid, and I just like it really. In my mind, and I feel like it's my mind telling me like you know the negative thoughts again, but I don't know that's just like what happened last night."
416.0,Provider,"So, in your dream, with the water with the beach. How did you feel in the dream."
14352.0,Patient,"I felt Okay, at first, and then I felt released just scared like just in fear like. Like oh my God, like the water is going to come and get me, and I remember this one time, when I was younger I didn't notice pays back with it, but. I thought I had a close call like when I was younger I don't know if I can call it that, but I remember, like the waves, just like. pushing down and push them down and sugar like to stay up or just just swept up and up and like I got up and I didn't even tell anyone about that, like it was just really scary I just felt like I was young, like I don't remember maybe like a chain aid, in turn, I don't know and. I just remember the water, just like pushing me down or her score up just pull up and then. I don't know if that has to do with anything now like subconsciously or it's just my negative thoughts subconsciously telling me things and like going back to being. Emotionally right when I have those dreams, I feel like subconsciously either i'm doing something wrong or someone else is doing me wrong or something like it's weird and then. When I had a really nice dream of water months ago it was like really iridescent and I was like whoa like what is my subconscious telling me time and really your dream person, so I really like. Connected my dreams, I guess, I don't know soon I have bad dreams I just feel like either something's wrong going on with me or someone else's like doing the wrong I don't know it's weird. So that's how I feel."
416.0,Provider,"So dreams and dreams, especially yeah like you know our rem sleep is really a place where. Where we were our brains workout stuff that it. Yes, and working out when we are awake. Sometimes it works out trauma, so it could be something connected to I suspect that's why you have a water theme is because you have like a water, you had a scary situation with water that your brains kind of working. On and but also it can work out like they can use that our brain can use that time to work out some like unresolved feelings unresolved emotions. Right, with a subconscious going okay well. i'm gonna i'm going to create something bizarre because you have big feelings, I need to get worked out. it's so. So whenever I have a weird dream I always just try to think about like what is it what did I walk away feeling like in this dream, what was the what was the like sort of emotional theme of the dream and sometimes it's like for me, sometimes it's like helplessness. or sometimes it's. it's fear or sometimes it's. I don't know sometimes it's."
14352.0,Patient,"I think, maybe for me. or being."
416.0,Provider,Out of control is another set for a lot of times for people feeling like you don't have control over the situation.
14352.0,Patient,"Yes, I feel like that is a because I have like really bad trust issues so like because. Like I feel like even even best friends have like done me wrong before so it's like I feel like maybe connect with trust issues, but I have to work on, because. I really trust myself and i'm such a loyal person so like when someone else's name wrong it's like Why would you do that to me like I was so good to you know and it's just like they're like it's that, as well as like trying to control. Emotions as well as helpfulness I like the health one is because that's kind of how I felt like my dream last night so yeah."
416.0,Provider,You have a.
14352.0,Patient,lot as well yeah so i'm gonna look on not yeah so.
416.0,Provider,I mean just. paying attention to it.
14352.0,Patient,it's nice to just go whoa whoa I wonder what this is telling me.
416.0,Provider,"What is the theme here. I mean it's not as simple, I know that there's like books out there that they're like if you have a snake in your dream it. means that's not how. I mean there is some symbolism and dreams because that's how our brains work but it's not it's not quite that straightforward so."
14352.0,Patient,gotcha okay. Okay cool.
416.0,Provider,yeah.
14352.0,Patient,i'll work on all about so sounds good.
416.0,Provider,"All right, well um let's see do we have another session schedule."
14352.0,Patient,I think it's the 27 and i'm sure.
416.0,Provider,I think we do to let me. Just double check. Keep up the good work.
14352.0,Patient,"Thank you i've been really i've been really trying a lot, and also to sing my uncle he's also helped in brea kind of have the not the same brain, but like you know he's also, I think, is a little bit bipolar himself so like it helps a little bit that we can connect. So, and all his. Also to my little cousin she's actually on the same medication as me he went through a lot German covert ahead so it really took a toll on her. And we actually connect a lot, so I have family that really helps as well, so it's been helping yeah."
416.0,Provider,um yeah we're scheduled for the 27th at 945 so. We should be all that. i'll See you in two weeks send um and keep working on it.
14352.0,Patient,"Alright, thanks Julie so much thank you."
416.0,Provider,Right wrestling take care.
