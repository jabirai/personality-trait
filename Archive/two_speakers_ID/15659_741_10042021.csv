15659.0,Patient,"um so I was on like I take gabapentin. Okay, but many times a day and in the past, I was on wellbutrin and out of band. Okay, and. Recently I had talked to this psychiatry's you know, in the past, it was it was since i've been here, you know, and I music with him. That he didn't know what he was doing about my meds he had put me on like let's Huda he put me on eschatology putting on seroquel and then all of a sudden, I went down on my bed. And I was pissed off and depressed and so I got I just stopped taking it cold Turkey, and I said you're not giving me the medication that I need so i'm not work with you anymore. Because now my life has changed and i'm fighting for my life and trying to stay right and getting out here being depressed like that I might as well go back on drugs, you know, and so I. Just told them, you know, this is not working, for me, and so the Council chair very proud of me for advocating for myself and letting them know when something was wrong and that the medications weren't right, and they are in fact making me feel. very worried feel things gather like it wasn't normal so they're very proud of me that I was able to come out of it and that i've seen more presidents and clear headed and that i'm not on those medications anymore so."
741.0,Provider,I don't. Those are heavy duty men.
15659.0,Patient,"yeah and i've never been on those before i've always been on well you'd write an advantage, so I wanted to counsel through you guys through my trauma through my substance abuse. I wanted to know how the therapist to talk to you and people to talk to you to help me, I want to get on out of you, and I want to go on my wall Tutoring. When i'm on will theater and it's like everything clicks before the drugs, you know it's like my but the compartmentalization in my brain. works in such a way that it organizes it and it makes it like a schedule in my head. So when I have things to do as far as like doctors appointments disability appointments any. Social security any probation appointments or prop 47 appointments you know or appointments with you guys, it makes it to where i'm accountable for myself and I can actually function on a basis where. I before the drugs, you know it was need before the drugs, you know what I mean, I have the motivation comfortable because paperwork stresses me out. You know, it stresses me out it's something that you know i'm starting my life here and i'm going to be getting out and it's like i'm responsible for myself and for being an adult you know and that's something that I have I haven't really done, you know. I haven't. been responsible so it's kind of scary. But. know that if I go back on the right medication it'll be there to support me because, since then, I. I feel at first when I got off that medication, I was like a skeleton like crawling on my skin, you know, and it was just making me feel really weird. I had talked about I was on Sunday tech I detox off the BAT because I didn't know which medication was making me feel that way. And so I know now that if I feel cravings for drugs that I could possibly get back on suboxone or sub you tech it's just right now currently I don't feel the need for that, but it does help with my anxiety as well. So um but yeah so I just wanted to talk to you see what you think about that um let you get to know me a little bit more, you know."
741.0,Provider,"I think you. Work I applaud you for for standing up for yourself a lot of people don't realize that they can tell us our characters no I won't take that because I don't tolerate those side effects that you know. yeah a lot of people don't understand that, and right now, you seem to be functioning fairly well. And without medication. I know that you're fixing to step out of a cocoon. So that feels real uncertain right now. and probably really scary. um. But let's see how you height, how you do in the next week or show. Okay, with the support and everything um i'm not your prescriber, you will have a prescriber. And so that's fine you know. and So we'll just kind of play it by ear for right now okay."

You know it's like I get a job you know i'm so we're you know i'm on my meds well I haven't I haven't been in a long time, but so I wasn't on meds this last time, when I got clean and. I was working at Nicole as a clothing retail store and then I just started using drugs, you know what I mean and. So it was just a problem because my friend, that was taking me to work every day, he was like okay let's do it let's do it let's do it let's smoke, you know, and I was like no. I can't because my tolerance is going to go up i'm going to get addicted you know and i'm gonna start having use it i'm starting meeting it I can't. And so anyway that continued to me kind of pushed his way into my life into my grandmother's house and I was living there with my kid and my daughter my mom my grandparents and. He was just very like controlling you know and so she kind of made it seem like he was a good guy, and so I got pushed out of the loop, you know what I mean I started using heroin again. And so that's what pushed me out of the House and that's what pumped up my job, and then I became late, and then I was messed up the whole time and then he was there, of course, pick me up you know to mean and sweep me off my feet when like I got you know called out on it, you know. yeah so basically I got fired you know so. it's just a function like that you know I mean you know or. You know it's like my my life hasn't been stable enough or i'm not stable enough to keep you know what I mean it's one of the two you know. In my path history, you know what I mean so either i've been given a chance, and I fucked it up or I was unstable, you know I mean."
741.0,Provider,Right right okay. um alright so um. Are you do you think you're going to want assistance with your employment when you get out of there. you're going to want me to help you with like like resumes and things like that or is that something you've got handled.
15659.0,Patient,"um so with the with this job that I want to work for tesla it's a factory and they hire you on the spot. And the only thing is there's drugs there you know, but I talked to my PO about it, you know, and he says, you know it's not really concerned, you know it's doable that I do it because it's good money, but I just have to stay straight on focus, you know what I mean on. me and I. Good work ethic and i'm a hard worker it's easy for me just to do my job, you know what I mean. And you know, but I just need to look look the other way and make sure I don't take ride from anybody that's on drugs."
741.0,Provider,"You know right right. Okay, so we need to work on your refusal skill. And stuff like that. Okay that's that's good to know um alright, so you said you have a child, have you ever been married."

You know my goal is to eventually go out there and visit them and see them, you know what I mean and try and figure out how i'm going to integrate myself back into my daughter's life, you know."

Okay. So I have. Some family here for me and their their total support system, you know I mean they really are I mean like I could call them anytime you know I mean and pick up the phone and they'll be there."
741.0,Provider,Okay. Great So do you have any siblings.
15659.0,Patient,"I don't i'm an only child, I had a foster sister growing up in a step sister, but no more. So I I haven't I haven't talked to her in years."
741.0,Provider,Okay okay and. Are you currently satisfied with your relationship status.
15659.0,Patient,"um yeah I am on the only thing the only struggle in my life is that I have no one to talk to about the conflict between. Because I never i've been through so much you know and it's like, for my family to not understand why i'm still lesbian and why i'm still with the woman. You know they literally think that she's out of my life right now the only person that knows, the truth is my grandmother. And so, basically, I have to lie about it, or I don't have to live, but I don't tell them about it because. They think that, because of our past drug use they've that's all they've seen they've seen dysfunction. You know what I mean, but now that we're sober I mean two months sober, what do you expect you know what I mean they don't want to hear anything about us, you know, so I understand that. completely, but I just trust that god's going to work some things through, but sure focus is she has her kids she wants me to get out to Texas and be a mom my kid and she'll follow so it's not really a conflict too much because she just wants me to do the right thing you know. it's just my relationship status is like i'm not interested in guys i'm not looking for anybody, I will not tolerate anybody in my life that you know it's just i'm very shut off from that you know type. know, especially for fun."
741.0,Provider,"Well, and i'm gonna pat sorry about that."
15659.0,Patient,Okay.
741.0,Provider,"turn everything off and okay so. Honestly relationship with the last thing you need to deal with right now i'm getting clean and sober and stabilizing yourself and taking care of yourself, for your kids and all that stuff that really is your priority. And sometimes when you have a relationship and it just kind of. That interferes and it right, the whole mass that you don't really need to deal with right now. Right and then about a year. You know. yeah and I know that sounds like a really long time."
15659.0,Patient,"Because it sounds like you did it, you know I understand."
741.0,Provider,"Alright, so. These kind of questions we kind of weird because who lives with you, will you live with a whole bunch of people. um. Are you okay with with your current situation coming out of treatment and going into a transitional living."
15659.0,Patient,"that's so that's something that i've never done before in my life it's very new it's very unknown there's a lot of fear there there's a lot of anxiety there's a lot of like. Like I case or walk miles, or like back and forth because, like, I just have so much like anxiety on what's going to happen or what's not going to happen, but i'm trying to smoothly say that I want to transition into a supportive loving unifying home that's not. pick you apart and start drama in in kind of thing because that's what I don't need it so the one of the counselors is very, very supportive in that. And so I think I might be moving and transitioning into a different House actually because I told her this morning I don't want to move my stuff twice. You know I need to I can't be in a house where someone's going to pinpoint things and try and start drama for me. I have so much going on right now my life with my counseling and all the fucking programs i'm in it's like i'm trying to fix up my life because I fucked it up so bad, you know and it's like I don't need any more drama, you know. I don't need it on my plate that's not positive you know if it's positive and it's good for me then i'll feed myself with it, but if it's not i'm gonna leave it alone. So I told him this morning and I voice my opinion on that and I talked to my dad about it, and he said no. He said uh yeah that's way too unhealthy, you know what I mean in it, and he goes well you know the enemy is setting that up for you bro so you can either be the bigger person and walk away, you know when someone tries to verbally attack you, you know what I mean and."
741.0,Provider,It right.
15659.0,Patient,"Or you know I mean or you know you could try and move to different house and so that's the current conclusion that we came with this morning was me speaking out and saying hey. This girl has an OCD problem major OCD and she likes start fights with people and I can't be around that because i'm the type of person, where there is no in between with me. If you threaten me like she did saying that Britney if you're not serious about your programs you're not sober and felt fucking doing it don't come over here. You know, and that to me was a threat, and so I went like zero to 1000 I was like Okay, you know, because in my mind i'm already attacking you i've already attached to you and beat you up right now there's fence wasn't in the way you know but it's like. And that's the thing with me like if you threaten me or if you come at me cross, there is no like in between like I don't know what to do other than what i've been trained. To do is like attack you know and so i'm very like you might get your first shot, you know what I mean and say something like she did. But there was a Gate in the way I didn't say anything to her, I just requested to move a house, you know because i'm not going to be around that type of shit because if you verbally try and. go there with me it's like I don't know what to do it stresses me out and it gets me, so I just want to jump I just want to attack you know, and so I don't want to be an environment where i'm constantly being triggered because my triggers that's what my triggers you know."
741.0,Provider,Okay yeah I can understand that. yeah I get an environment where i'm being attacked either. verbally or physically.
15659.0,Patient,"yeah so that's one of my personal triggers that you need to like be aware of is just that, like if I feel attacked or something like that, or if I feel like threatened. Then I fucking problem I have a really big problem processing it talking about it, you know, like the past two days i'm just been like what the hell, you know, like I don't know what to do. You know, and I just tell myself well that's not that's not what you're going to do bro you're you're not gonna you're not going to go there, you know I mean you're not going to go there you're not complete your hands on people. that's not how you operate anymore you're not in that environment anymore you don't have to do that, you have nothing to prove to anybody, you know but it's like sometimes like I just get so angry and so. You know, sometimes I snap you know I mean and so i've dealt with my anger, you know I mean a lot worked on it, since I was a little kid but I learned. When I was younger from watching my dad treating my mom the way that he did. I learned to fight her every day and so she wakes me up the same every morning and so either I would go kicking and screaming. You know, or I would be nice, but you know I I had an anger problem you know, and I from watching them fight all the time and so. But now through what i've been through it's a I have trauma, you know, and I have triggers you know I mean there's some stuff that I just can't deal with. And that would cause me for me to say that, yes, I am disabled right now, yes, I am i'm dealing with a mental illness i'm dealing with ptsd i'm dealing with. Sexual verbal emotional spiritual trauma, you know what I mean stuff that i've been through that is fucking insane. You know I mean and people would never think it's just unspeakable you know I mean that people out there knew that somebody and be narcissistically involved. and have no feeling and no remorse and no sorrow over what they've done to me, you know, so I did come in here beat up, I was not saved I. You know I finally got away by you know, thank God, a referral from drug court, you know got me in here and so now i'm just trying to clean up my life, you know, and I just don't want a problem you know."
741.0,Provider,Right. Okay. So. Do you have a close relationship with your mom.
15659.0,Patient,"yeah so um, I can tell my mom anything she's very supportive she's very loving. You know she followed god's invitation and and God opened doors for her to move out to Texas I didn't want my daughter growing up here. You know I just thought that this world's falling apart in the way that it is, it was safer place to to be to Tyler Texas, where she's at right now God really opened the door. You know and it's they're safe out there, you know my daughter loves her school, I have a good relationship with my mom. The only thing with my mom is that I have to keep her at a distance, sometimes like she does not know about my personal relationship with Valerie my girlfriend. She cannot know if she knows, or if my daughter knows, they will take her away or say that I cannot see her ever again so that is something that they don't want to talk about. So also my father, you know I said, well, I needed a birthday card, for you know my daughter, and my mom and. So I said vows sending some money and my step mom and my aunt my God they're all just to give they're all just anti bow you know, basically, and so. I understand I understand why everyone's dance high bell right, you know what I mean I get it, you know but and and rightfully so but it's not like. i'm going to be dysfunctional person forever, you know, but I have a lot to prove so that's why I don't focus on that relationship so much I talked to her every day for 10 minutes and that's it. You know what I mean and i'm strict on that because i'm not going to be involved on the phone all the fucking time and so self involved that i'm not focusing on what I need to be focusing on. You know what I mean because there's been a time in place have had three and a half years and i've selfishly focus on her over my kid. And so my priorities are fucking right right now and they're straight, you know I mean so and that's the way we keep them I don't need to fall away I don't need to get started. And it's really easy not to now because she's not here if she were here it'd be a whole fucking different ballgame I probably would not i'd be fucked basically so i'm really happy that she's not here. Honestly i'm really happy right he's not close to me because the way we get involved with each other, is very, very selfish and it's like we don't even see anything else about you know we just we've had a past, you know I mean that hasn't been. Healthy, and so we need to learn how to be silver and how to support each other the right ways and the healthy ways, instead of being you know involved with each other in a way that you know we just blow the whole world off, you know what I mean."
741.0,Provider,"Okay, and so you have a close relationship with your mom and your dad. Do you have a close relationship with your child. You have one right."
15659.0,Patient,"yeah yeah and she's turning 11 on October 16, and so I basically, I have a close relationship with her, I call her every day, you know for 10 minutes that's what i'm allowed right now. I try and her door her sometime i'm trying to basically be consistent with her, because I need consistency, but she needs it for a long time, you know yesterday on the phone with the first time that I noticed that she was like. kind of wanting to talk to me and just use to again me calling, you know and that's taken 75 fucking days you know what I mean for me to engage with her, and so I noticed that my consistency with her it's However much I want to put in, is what i'm going to get back basically. You know what I mean and so um before, so the not calling the not calling is bullshit and when I promised her things I need to fucking follow through God damn it I better fall through because it's not going to be good if I don't."
741.0,Provider,"know because, otherwise, she can't trust you."
15659.0,Patient,"yeah yeah and so i'm just really trying to work that trust with her as much as possible, because she's at a point, right now, where it's like she says my heart smashed and pieces and it's broken I don't have one, you know."
741.0,Provider,And so.
15659.0,Patient,"it's and honestly the girls been through so much and I totally feel, and I am i'm responsible for that you know and so. Now it's like i'm trying to let her know that she can talk to me or say anything at any given moment at any time of the day, whenever she wants. You know, however, she feels she could talk to me and say whatever, and so I let her know that and so she knows that about me but it's just I have to work on more the relationship, you know. And I know that when I get out of here this stuff will be different i'll have my phone and I could talk to her, you know about stuff. Oh, sometimes she does take the phone you know, and she goes away from my mom you know what I mean and talks to me, so I just really need to work on that right now."
741.0,Provider,You know right.
15659.0,Patient,"yeah so that's I mean that's that's basically my goal that's basically my goal that's my pride in my joy that's my soul right there that's like the void that i've been like missing like you know what I mean and trying to fill you know to be. With her again, you know what I mean, and they want me to be like this God fearing woman. But i've been a God fearing lesbian, you know I mean pretty much and it's just like I feel like my family should understand through what i've been through why i'm with a girl. But right now, they don't and so you know but it's something that I just kind of leave out, and so I know my focus and so that should be my focus. More on that than the relationship so basically you know what I mean she's just friending me, you know I mean she's just being there for support and things like that you know I mean, but our relationship is not. Obviously, like involved selfishly and intimate right now, you know we're not like that so."
741.0,Provider,"Good Okay, have you had any significant problems with your mom."
15659.0,Patient,i'm.
741.0,Provider,So.
15659.0,Patient,"moving along so growing up, I So when I was four years, clean, I came home, I was at it was supposed to go to a year long program when my daughter was a baby. And so, basically, she got full custody, because she took me to court, when I was in jail for six months, the first time I was ever in jail. And I gave full custody thinking that that was the right thing to do. The wrong thing to do, was not to fight for my daughter, I never fought for my daughter I didn't understand the Court legal system, it stresses me out, I had no idea what to do. I thought I was doing the right thing by giving my daughter you give me my mom full custody. When I came back from this four and a half year clean sober fucking program you know because I said I wanted my daughter back, and I was gonna start fighting for in Stockton, she said it's not fucking safe. And I said well i'm under the covering of God, you know and i'm full time you know ministry, right now, like why what did I what have I done that it's going to be a fight for you and me to get my daughter back so we've kept it basically open. You know what I mean like I could be in her life as long as i'm clean and sober and doing good, but she has expectations on me like. And I, and I know that all she wants from me, is really just to be a mom you know I mean she wants me to be a good mom like somebody that she can trust somebody that's independent somebody that's working. and providing a house for her daughter, you know that's who she wants me to be. You know what I mean, and so I understand that, but her relationship with my stepfather for 22 years since I was nine. has really like they didn't let me back in the House, you know what I mean and I lived at my dad's house for six months. She said, I have to see you clean and sober for six months, with a job you didn't need before I can let you back into the House well, I made it five months. And then I got on heroin and that's what my heroin addiction started I had so much fucking resentment against my mom. You know I mean in her marriage for them not letting me back after I was clean and sober in a program four and a half years I didn't understand why couldn't use my four year old daughter. You know, to mean that needed her mom so bad, you know, and then by the time I went over for visits and stuff it was just I would wake up morning, and then I was chewed up with heroin, you know, in the bathroom you don't have enough and so. You know, I was just already gone, I was already had so much resentment I didn't understand you know to me like it broke my heart and so. All right, Ben started talking to people and they said that I need to keep my mom at a distance and I need to not tell her every single thing that's going on in my life, because if I do. Then she's involved then she grows in opinion, then it can create a wedge. So um so that's what happened."
741.0,Provider,"Okay. yeah Okay, so you have alluded to the fact that you were abused emotionally physically and sexually. who have you been abused, why."
15659.0,Patient,"um so I I was abused by my. This guy that was three months, out of prison, I went to go check on a. person in the church and. There was a house there with a whole bunch of apartments in it and they were all paid off, and it was just a big thing, and so I. I thought. It was safe and it wasn't and he said that he knew my boyfriend he said that he knew my homeboys. And so I thought he was cool I thought I could trust him and then he locked the door, and then I couldn't get out. So, and it was like nobody cared like if you were screaming you know the COPs wouldn't call you know what I mean, and it was just very like I was just tracks, you know I mean and so. You know the things that happened in that room, you know what I mean I mean I couldn't imagine, and I still was just bewildered on like how the Fuck somebody to do that to somebody and then get away with it, you know what I mean and so. I like I got away and I told somebody I went to go have it handled, you know because I wanted them I wanted them to kill them and then. Someone convinced me to tell the COPs, and so I told the cost Well he found out that I told the COPs. And so that would that I would a strike team out basically so then he took me. And made sure that he brainwashed me made sure that he fucked me up bad enough, even more for telling the COPs that way, I would go in there it's helicopter he's my boyfriend and that he did nothing wrong and that what I said wasn't true, so the investigation stopped. They busted me and put me in protective custody for having a gun underneath my seat just about down the road you know what I mean. and I didn't know the gun was there, but I was going to go help, and I was going to go kick His door in here, and I mean and we're going to go handle it, I was pregnant at the time with my boyfriend's kid and so, then. He went to jail. I got let go and then from then on it's still the abuse still continued. You know I can't really remember how and why I know that I was completely like. combative, and I was here at this rehab Center when I snapped at two girls and I beat the shit out of both of them and I left in handcuffs because they're trying to say. That I was on heroin and it was my safe place and I just came back from a visit and I was very, very fucking upset. You know that they ruin my safe place so I felt unsafe and the minute I felt unsafe I just snapped and so a lot came out that I don't really remember, but I know that a lot of the officers, it was sad but they had to take me away, you know. So, ever since i've been very. Like I have flashbacks and I have things that some days I can talk about it, you know I mean and i'll say what happened, but sometimes I don't, but when I do I automatically forget about what i'm talking about you know. Because of brainwashing was so strong you know what I mean and the things that were I were happening to me, you know what I mean at the time. And in my sleep and being drugged and just break and just abused and tormented your enemies sexually you know, tortured and shit like that that's just not anything anybody can. You know, no one can handle that so that's when I decided i'm going to go on a mission to fucking kill myself, you know in overdose so i've overdose 41 times and. You know, I have a history of overdosing you know and so that's where like I I put myself in unsafe situations and not giving a Fuck because. I have hate towards what happened me, you know and that's the shit that I don't need to be doing I don't need to be saying Fuck it screw it, you know what I mean, because if I get there i'll do it and it's just I find myself over you know. And I don't want to do anymore, you know."

Right so right. i've just been but it's not my drug of choice, the reason why I started the heroin when this abuse started was because. It was too much for me and I had no control, and so I literally like went out of my mind so many times like. I separated my my mind from what was going on, so bad because, like I had it's crazy experiences were like my body would be. Out of itself, and I will be watching what's going on, and then I would like fly up into the air, you know and go to different places like in my mind, because I couldn't handle what was going on, you know."
741.0,Provider,"Right right Okay, so how old were you, the first time you use math."

How do you say it's like a fucking craving that you just it's like over and over and over and over and over again, you know what I mean and it's like. it's very habitual for me and so i've been trying to stop and so i've gotten myself to the point where like I can try and smoke a cigarette you know, but then I just gag on it, you know what I mean. So i'm just trying to like run you know when I get sober. You know I think about stuff you know, and I get angry and I just start running on the treadmill or just start running you know excessively the point where, like all. are hurt my body, and you know make myself tire because you know the stress and anxiety, you know, so I do run a lot. that's what i've been doing, they have a treadmill here so for the past week that I haven't been on medications been really. Tough, and so I just put the music in my ears when my mom she bought me a music player that I could do that my dad just said run on the treadmill as much as I can you know.

I needed to save my life, you know I knew that I needed to reach out to somebody in the court system and let them know what's going on in my life. And so they saw me unfit and mentally unstable, not for for orientation of the drug court, they said there's no fucking way, we need to get her stabilized she needs medication immediately and. Because the things that I was saying we're not safe I didn't feel safe and they were very concerning and so Basically, they said that I need to seek safety. Man so be putting the safe house and so. So they got me a referral to here, and this is where i've been and I got in really fast and that right there for me was like a lot of godson you know and i'm so grateful that i'm here, you know because yeah."
741.0,Provider,"All right, so and. How many times have you i'm just going to ask you some questions about some charges Okay, how many times have you been arrested and charged with shoplifting or vandalism."

We were returning a tent all the sudden it was like they were like well, you have a belt in there and I was like wait no was like we were returning it and I was gonna buy it I just put it in the badge to hold a. mean, and so I got charged with petty theft and I had to do some time for that."
741.0,Provider,"Okay, and any probation or parole violations."
15659.0,Patient,"yeah so i'm on probation and I got a violation I got a violation for the sheriff's have found me and I was. All my I had sock this truck thinking that my mom and my daughter would be trafficked, and they were in the truck. I heard them banging on things and there but they really weren't in there, and so I stopped it all night, and I was trying to get it open because I was trying to get them out, and so, when the Sheriff Scott there and. My my probation saw that, like, I was not getting better he said Okay, you need to reset and you need to go to jail, because we need to get her stable because she's not safe. You know I I constantly I picked apart my face so bad that I was unrecognizable because I was so stressed out because. I was hearing voices and I was hearing my daughter being raped, I was hearing my family being abused. Everything that i've been through it was like it was happening to them and I couldn't stop the phone calls that I was making to my mom. Were concerning and I would even call the police, all the time and say check on my family check on them and make sure they're in Texas, because I felt that the cartel who taught them."
741.0,Provider,"Okay, and how many times have you been arrested and charged for good."
15659.0,Patient,i've been arrested and charged for drugs probably about like three times.
741.0,Provider,"Okay, how about forgery."
15659.0,Patient,"So the first time I got in trouble, it was in 2010 and that's when my baby I had that appointment know with. In that court date in that courtroom when I do full custody my mom I was caught by the feds and I was sru and they came down to sacramento and they got me for. Five counts the second degree of burglary five Council forgery. for having counterfeit money and so. They dropped it down just to one, so I do have, I think it's forgery felony forgery on a record. And then. Recently, before I came in here and I was out of family member's house and I was underneath the House and. I found a school and a spine and so that's when I flipped out and I took my relatives truck and I took the school and I took the spine for evidence and. The helicopter got mean that a county posture county bought me. And they put a ring of my bra took the evidence and called me crazy. And so I have elder abuse on the record now. My grandfather loves me very much he's i'm the only person that i'll talk to him family he's old you know, and I just his truck without asking, but I was scared. And so I just kind of got caught up, I was going to do the right thing and bring the truck back, I was on my way back. But I had stopped at a police officers house and didn't know it, and asked him for help and so that's why I got the elder abuse. So i'm sure the charges, the charges will probably be dropped I just need to work on that with my case, but my PO. He just wants me he's in my corner, he said, Brittany if you're stressed out, we can speed up this process, we can slow it down the Court just want me to get help. They want me to get counseling they want to know that i'm going to be stable and then i'm not going to be out there, trying to commit crimes because I think my family's in a fucking container or something you know. Right, so I do I need help honestly I need help you know i'm not gonna lie knock and say i'm Okay, I have a lot of trauma, you know, and I don't know why I thought they were in there, but voices were saying that so. You know voices on you know they stopped I just kept telling myself like it would be like. As if I heard the counselor each counselor would talk right and speak I was having hallucinations like say like you talk to you would be my dad's voice the other person would talk that's my mom's voice. You know, and then they were just talking about me, you know and about how i'm safe here and things like that, so it was like. yeah if you weren't talking directly to me and I heard you talking, it was like in a different ways, it was my family's voice, and so they said, like this was my safe place. So I just kept telling myself the voices are going to go away as long as I stay here and work through it and so eventually they did, and I got control of that and God took that away no I just kept praying you know, like God help me, you know what I mean get stable, you know. loose nation, when I came in a guy was beat up, and so I ran up to him and I gave him a hug and I held, and I said, are you Okay, he goes no i'm not he started crying broke down in my arms. And so the counselors like come over here and sit and it was like immediately, like the first time in my life, where like I went like this and then it was like. Okay come sit down, it was like I was in trance you know and they're like come sit down and then I like thought I saw my dad through this person, and I was like. dad is it going to be all right, are you Okay, you know and he's like it's okay I love you and I was like I love you too, you know. And like this person like the way they dealt with me was very, very soft you know I mean, but I was completely hallucinating at that point, you know what I mean and so that's how bad and that's it that's the extent and the depth that my trauma goes, you know what I mean. I how I experience things when I get super stressed out and it's firing off up here if I don't stop that I fucking start to lose my mind, you know what I mean it's not a. You know what I mean it's scary. it's scary to go there, because I know that i'm probably. One step away from it, you know it just doesn't it just depends, you know what I mean and so that's what. I want to try and control of. You know what I mean."
741.0,Provider,How many times have you been arrested and charged with assault.
15659.0,Patient,"So one time, when I was here in. that's that's I got two months for assault battery."

15659.0,Patient,"Right now, on my record, if you look it up in my background it's just going to say probably like taking a truck without permission or like maybe possibly elder abuse I don't know. And my forgery I got that wipe off my record, but I since then had gotten trouble, so it probably all pops up."
741.0,Provider,"All right, and. um. Have you been treated for psychological or emotional. Problems in a hospital, we were Inpatient overnight."
15659.0,Patient,"yeah So when I got here they took me to the hospital. And I was completely like I recognized the girl that was there, and she wanted to take my vitals and I flipped out like because that was the girl that I had been put on a cycle, because of the COPs I had. Some guy tied my wrist up and he said he's going to keep me in a closet for week because he said I stole his wallet so I had broke out bathroom window with my hand and busted my hand and almost size my hold them off. He brought me in there cuz he found me down the street and so he had in my hand sewed up, but I was on a site called I was long cycle, because I kept calling the police, saying that my family was not state. So then, when I got here they took me in there, one more time I recognize that girl from earlier. And there are certain rooms for 20 people and they were trying to enforce that I was out of my mind, and I was mentally unstable. And they said, we are going to keep you if you don't cooperate, and so I just you know recently like got on a psych hospital for this, you know because I was held for five days in there, you know I mean because they said, and I just said, I was unstable. Because of the drugs, I know it was because of the drugs and I just told them basically what they wanted to hear, but I didn't believe it because of my head was telling me they were screaming at me telling you know this is real. And so, but I had to tell them, otherwise you know so then there was 20 people in the room, and they said so they got another person take my vitals they shot me up with a. Out of me on in one leg, and then they shot me up with another something and one leg and then at four in the morning it was like an angel light, you know, seeing. You know the director of this program to come in and say you're coming back with us, you know, and so that right there was just like. I fucking was crying I was like please take me home, you know I mean this is my home Now this is where i'm safe, you know, this is where I need to be you know and i've come really far from that moment, you know what I mean. Right difficult has been difficult, but i'm really proud of myself and proud of God, bringing me out of it, and I know that you know everything I went to it just wasn't permanent you know."
