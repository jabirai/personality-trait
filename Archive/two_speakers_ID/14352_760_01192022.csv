760.0,Provider,How are you.
14352.0,Patient,i'm good today how are you.
760.0,Provider,doing good.
14352.0,Patient,Good good.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so. um I wanted to talk to you a little bit about. What, what are the things that you want to work on what is, you know what are your struggles. So maybe just give me a like a or maybe what, what do you want the focus of the sessions to be about I guess. The way to put that."
14352.0,Patient,"gotcha I feel like my what I really want to work on is basically like my overthinking and then just getting out of like depressive states. Sometimes i'll do really good one day, and then the next is just pretty crappy and definitely I know that's a lot to do with mindset and especially because I just started working again. Last month I was out of work for about like four or five months and so definitely that helped a lot, because I felt like i'd never really got a break from work so i've been working since I was 18 which, which is fine, but you know, sometimes you just need to like a little break and. Still, I was out of work, and then, finally, when I got back to work, I felt like that was a huge like stepping stone considering. I felt like even back in like October November, like, I still wasn't okay to work again considering I talked to people on the phone all day i'm a collection representative for cars, so I call people to be like hey like you know when you get a band make the payment and stuff. So sometimes it's pretty hard."
760.0,Provider,yeah I can imagine.
14352.0,Patient,You have.
760.0,Provider,You may. yeah stressful.
14352.0,Patient,"Yes, so sometimes pretty stressful just because I like the customers and sometimes i'm just there to help and I try not to take things so personally because i'm like i'm just trying to like help you, you know some just like. A nice person, but when they get really nasty it just a kind of you know, is not fun, but I mean So when I went back to work for that. I was doing Okay, at first, but now like this month, I feel like i'm doing a lot better than I was last month it's just. Because I feel like i'm working again i'm actually like driving again and, like actually doing like normal things again like going out to like do errands and everything, because at first like. I felt like I couldn't even really just like go out, you know, and my boyfriend he helps me a lot, but he really wants me to like be more stronger, which I do as well, but sometimes I just feel like I get more depressed than I do. Then, like maybe have anxiety or happy episodes I guess I don't really know how to explain it but. I just. Like it, for example, like for him it's like you get up in the morning you shower and you go to work and everything is timings for me like i'm the type of person, where I just love like sleeping which is not a good sign, considering it's like you know it's your yeah and. it's a lot harder for me to just like get up and do everything and. Go on, with my day, basically, so I try to take everything, step by step, like when I know when I got out of the hospital and everything I tried. just doing a morning routine thinking on the little things like brushing your teeth and you get up making your bed, maybe doing the dishes like things like that so just kind of keep my hands like preoccupied. So that helps and into like instead of doing like house chores i'm trying to find something that I like to do instead of just like going on my phone or watching TV like I really want to do like make clothes and stuff so I want to be occupied of my hand so i'm thinking about."
760.0,Provider,"Somebody looking for something kind of a creative pen have an outlet, that would be."
14352.0,Patient,distracting and.
760.0,Provider,"And kind of help you yeah I. I noticed, if you could talk a little bit about the mental health symptoms, because you mentioned about overthinking. And you mentioned about depression. So do you wake up feeling depressed or can you speak to me on the symptoms that. yeah usual or comments or Apps."
14352.0,Patient,"So I feel one major thing about my depression is so back in 2017 my out of my childhood home, so that was a really big thing a huge event that happened, and my family is not living all together in the same state so. Ever since then, it just feels like another I heard and kind of get my words out. Okay, so back in 2017 me moves out of my childhood home and my grandparents parents me my mom. my grandparents, which is my mom's parents and my brother and sisters so we've lived there, mostly our entire life, and that was right after I graduated high school. And so after that it just felt like our family kind of like broke a little bit considering we've always lived together in certain circumstances, had happened to that's why we had to like move out and then the next year. My uncle passed away, which we were really close with and i've never dealt with. Like a really close family member passing away. So that happened and ever since 2010 I just felt a little different i've never been in a mental institution or ever in therapy which i've always was interested in it just never happened and I felt like I was just like kind of shut off on certain like emotions, in a way, and. I thought I just never dealt with that part of my life basically when he passed, because I was going through something during that time and I felt like I couldn't be open with anyone. And so I just felt really like. out in a way, I didn't get to cope how I wanted to."
760.0,Provider,"Do you think you were pressed your grief your emotion, with his passing."
14352.0,Patient,"I yeah I, and I feel like what happened. This past year in 2021 it just all came to me out once like a. bomb like that's basically what happened with me and it was scary because when everything happened. I felt like there was like a perfect storm of what happened with me whenever I got it. We went to the hospital, because I was going on SLA because I just told you, I worked with the job for a collection. representative, so I felt like I just needed a break like I worked crazy hours I work, mostly every day over time, every day, and I really want a new job and I want any job, which is kind of hard right now I did everything that's going on and. So I was working that job and I was going on SLA so I felt like when I wasn't working like all my worries for just gone like I I don't need to worry about being. Talking in don't need to be worried about micromanaging I can just do what I want to do and i'm really into astrology and things like that, and like spirituality and all that. I really wanted to learn more about that, so I kind of made my time off. Like school for me and away with that type of stuff just because I wanted to learn a little bit more, and I ended up going on lexapro during that month of July and my doctor at the time prescribed me like a vitamin D pill and. I was also hiking a lot during that must that it was really hot and I just felt like. everything all at once, just. Just came to me like I don't know it was weird like it was a huge Epiphany like it felt like everything from my past trauma and. Everything just came up, but I was okay with it and I felt like I like because my mom and dad divorced when they were when I was like five or six Spanish was my first language ever and I ended up. Throwing that out the window, because I got upset that my parents divorced so. I never really liked my dad growing up, but like when this happened, I was like you know what like I forgive him like I just don't care i'm not gonna hold that grudge anymore, because it's just time to let it go. So when everything happened just came up at once, and it felt like my overthinking because I was an over thinker so. When everything came up everything in my mind like I literally felt like an iPad with like a million tabs open so it's like everything that happened in my life I was just okay with or. I just let it go and it was fine and like I was super happy about everything, and then me and my boyfriend, of course, we would we've been together eight years of last month, so we've known this for a long time so also you know every relationship isn't perfect so you know things. have happened and i've all these crazy things started coming into my head and I feel like that's where like my schizophrenia came in. Because I don't necessarily have like characters or I hear voices all the time it's just during that time, I felt like I was on the wrong medication to was more enhanced in my head I don't know how to explain that, but when I got the. medication, I felt so much better I wasn't getting anything like I was like. It felt so different because when I was on the wrong medication I just felt so scared in my own body and I never wanted to feel that way ever again and. And my uncle who passed, I felt like he was with me and honestly I could see him or he was talking to me, but like. I just felt like his presence like he wishes, I felt like he was there and like he was guiding me through everything because, with him, he had really bad drug problems and everything, so my family comes in a huge line of you know, mental illnesses depression, anxiety ADHD you know. Some drugs and stuff so I felt like he was saying to me like. rosie like you don't need these medications like you're going to be okay like you're going to be okay, because I was always anti like pills, and everything like no. Because my family's always been on them and I just did it not, and nothing against that it's just the way that like maybe they abused. I don't know I don't know if that's too much information, but like I just never wanted to end up. That way to rely on something when I can try to do it on my own my own happiness, I guess, and try to do things like you know make clothes draw dance to try to really bring back how I used to be before I guess everything. You know so."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so yeah you mentioned that your family moved out of the home. Do you think I know your uncle passed. Was there, like a break in the relationship emotionally or within some of the Members like your mother your parents."
14352.0,Patient,"it's so. very complicated. yeah like I feel like to during the time when my uncle was still alive, he was with his girlfriend not we weren't really fond we didn't really like her, and. Two with my grandparents moving out to their back to their home state which is an indiana because my grandma's parents. they're not doing too well, so they need back over there to help her so with them being away it just kind of felt like they were like the glue with everything so when my grandparents left it just kind of. It kind of just fell apart, I haven't other uncle who lives in the same city as nursing town as me, but you know he has his own family and stuff which I love them and everything, but you know, sometimes. Just different schedules and I just felt like with them like it just everything started falling apart, after that, and then my uncle passed it just like everything just everyone kind of completely lost it and I feel like with my family like me like. I don't know how to explain it like. I guess, I was like the special baby, because I was the first baby in a really long time that my family was born, like everyone was like Oh, we have a new baby and everything, so I feel like everyone comes to me for like the mediator on certain things and. I never took any of my family side so i've always I love I love everyone like you love your family unconditionally so like if anything makes sense, like it, it just like everyone has their own little problems and it just I don't know."
760.0,Provider,"It is for you to fix. Some some time now, and maybe. Maybe your grandparents were the ones that were do that, and now that they're gone they're so far away now. Yes, falling to you."
14352.0,Patient,"To do right because my mom always had this idea in her head that her mom loves me more than she loved her own daughter, and like I hate to like. You know, admit that to her like no like I just feel like you guys just have like differences and that's what I didn't like and the thing with my mom is like she's very. She doesn't like narcissistic people, but I feel like she's a very feature narcissist when it comes to certain things so like everyone always loved me and everything right and it just like my mom I felt like she was kind of. jealous of certain things and to like my mom would always asked me for money and everything, people are always asked me for things and stuff I would be the one to like clean the House and stuff besides. I was just like I felt like a little cinderblock most times. I don't know and not that my family was a terrible family because they aren't I just feel like most of us have our problems and it's ever been dealt with and i'm honestly, one of the first family members that have actually. they're going through therapy and actually doing what i'm supposed to be doing and. I i'm just glad that I got to take this step, because it's a huge step because none of my family members i've ever done this before and I felt like they were always kind of. Not necessarily against it, but just not for them, which I never really agreed with because i've always wanted to like go to therapy and i've always felt like I did need help it just I. didn't have the time to you know I guess look for therapists and stuff so when everything happened a few months ago, it was just crazy because my mom actually thought it was going to be like that forever, because I was such an A manic state. And I was just Okay, with everything like. My past my future my President like I didn't care what happened, like, I was so on cloud nine I felt like like I just didn't care anymore like I was just so happy and I. and to everyone else like it looked like I was like a little kid again, which I felt like a little kitty gun, which was not also not really a fun feeling when you're going through that because it feels like you can't get back to your senses and back into the present moment. So when I started going on the right medication everything um. I felt like I was more present and I was like wow like i'm actually here like i'm not overthinking and bringing up all my childhood trauma or memories now because, even when I was going through that manic state like one of my favorite movies, was the lion king. And so I would be like remember who you are and stuff like to my family and everything because, like I just felt like I was just Okay, with everything so when I. got everything I had for my childhood memories and just made it, who I am today like I was fine and then. Obviously, in September, after everything happened I hit my low and that's when it just I started to become a little bit depressed again and started thinking about my family and. Like all that and, like my biggest supporters like I mentioned in group a couple weeks ago are definitely like my friends and my boyfriend and stuff because they've been there for me forever and. Just a side note, like my mom she never really lived with us growing up, she was always like with boyfriends or. I don't know when we were younger and my mom and my mom and dad got divorced, he went to a lot of parties and stuff and I was really young like me to know you know why we were there really you know. And so I believe she went through a she went through a mental breakdown way back then and. I just feel like there's a lot of missing time that she wishes that she had with us, but now that i'm an adult and like I were older now it's just you can't really. You can't really make up for that time that's been lost in the past, now, so you have to set the move forward and. Another thing is when everything happened, I was originally supposed to move to indiana for a little bit just so that way I can get back on my feet and take a break from California and just. Like working and everything. And when that was supposed to happen. It ended up, not because we may have gotten like a fight, and it was pretty bad. I felt like she like resented me during that moment I didn't want to move to indiana with her and during that time I couldn't even go on an airplane like she got me a ticket and everything, but I was still. So, like manic and not doing okay like I couldn't even go on a plane, so when that happened I just felt like she was just like. I don't know just like she turned against me basically and. I really don't know how to explain it and I wouldn't I was fighting with her, I kept saying like, why do you think i'm different and stuff and because. my brother and sister, they are like burnett and like why and like they look completely differently, we look alike, but not the same, you know and so she was like we were made this love and blah blah, and I just felt like I had. I don't know it's just it's hard with her sometimes because I feel like she wants more of like a best friend than."
760.0,Provider,Like.
14352.0,Patient,"A daughter, and she loves me, but you know."
760.0,Provider,You think grandma was more of a mother figure for you growing up.
14352.0,Patient,"Yes. Definitely she definitely raised me and sort of my grandpa if it wasn't for them honestly like I don't. know where I would be really and I feel like my mom gets pretty jealous of the fact that, like my grandma had a relationship with me and, like my brother and sister going up because she was there, raising us but. My mom had me pretty young she had me and she was 18 and my brother at 20 and she she was young, you know. yeah didn't. really know what's going on, which I totally I give her so much props and especially to all the young moms to have had. Children so young, like I can't even imagine having three children at my age already you know so like I you know I definitely give her props everything that she's been through, but sometimes you just have to. let things go and you know move on from the process so that way you don't like pass it down, you know."
760.0,Provider,"Did did your mother, have you substances, when you were growing up, you know. You mentioned your uncle did."
14352.0,Patient,"yeah my uncle he was a pretty bad one, but my mom no not really she was she she drank a little bit, but now she doesn't drink at all, she knows that's not for her. I know that when I was in the hospital they wanted me to take out a van and I know she takes that. And I just I refuse to take a because everything that my family went through with codes and stuff like anything that I heard familiar, I was like I don't want that, like I don't want that, like I just didn't want to deal with, like any. I don't know addiction problems, but like she has like autoimmune diseases and everything so strong she's ever abused drugs entirely, but I just didn't want to end up in that way years from. Now you know, taking pills to. make myself feel better overlying the pain, or something so I just wanted to always take a healthy way out, I guess okay."
760.0,Provider,So how do you think you're overthinking affects you.
14352.0,Patient,"I feel like I get into certain scenarios into my head and even though, like they're not true, like they're just like intrusive thoughts and like I tried to. I don't know it's weird because all like, for example, if I go to event or like a friend's House like i'll think about everything that happened during that whole day for like a day or two and then. Get back into the present moment it's not like i'm I don't know it's just really I just like to think through my days I guess. And I haven't really didn't memory, so I don't know if that has something to do with it, I don't know I just like. I overthink a lot, or like when I see something and it like it triggers me in a bad way I tried to like connect the dots like I try to be like a detective about it and be like. Okay, what what is this and that like blah blah and see like why it like affects me and like to win I think something is true like I forgot what the right word is like cognitive."
760.0,Provider,cognitive distortions.
14352.0,Patient,"yeah like yeah like that, like if I like if I feel like the emotion and it's true like I feel like it's true even though it's not and like that's what my friends were telling me to like I feel like with you, like you. You try to pin on something and then you when you think it's true there's no turning back for you like you just want to believe it's true and that's what i'm."
760.0,Provider,Trying that's where the. that's where the thought kind of spins for you.
14352.0,Patient,"Yes, yes, and then I start overthinking about certain past things like Okay, what can connect with this and she's like that's so bad, they just don't do that because, then you start you know getting your negative thoughts and which. I hate getting into the negative sides, you know, so I just really want to try to control that and I really tried to be in the present moment like. mindfulness of just you know feelings, the couch that i'm sitting on or just looking what's in front of me, instead of back you know and it's like I know what I need to do it's just hard stepping into. The work, I guess, to do it when I know that it's a lot it's like working out your mind like working at your body you just need to like really do it every day, so that."
760.0,Provider,"You can take small steps you don't. You don't have to you know add things, little by little, so mindfulness you mentioned. yeah that's that's a really good coping skill we're going to be talking about mindfulness you miss group last week."
14352.0,Patient,And I got I got that back this week so i'm happy to go back this weekend when Dr set every two weeks. I thought they were always more virtually I. yeah okay.
760.0,Provider,"yeah right, so we are going to be discussing mindfulness."
14352.0,Patient,"Okay cool I, like my tennis. Week okay."
760.0,Provider,"You also mentioned traumatic experiences. So we don't have to go into. We don't have to go into details, I don't. Okay, we don't you don't have to tell me the whole story behind everything, maybe, just like kind of namer it generally. But you, you have. trauma ptsd."
14352.0,Patient,"A little bit i'm like. what's a. i'm trying to think of why. trauma is like childhood trauma I feel like that's with like my dad leaving and not knowing why because literally like he just left one day and honestly it's scary because. I don't remember the day he left I don't remember the day that, like my day was named divorced my mom just told me that I was so upset that like I wouldn't. Talk to her anything and she would talk to me in Spanish and i'd look I don't know what you're saying, even though I didn't know what she was saying and i've completely lost that language. And it was crazy, because when everything happened back in August I felt like I could speak Spanish again because people are like oh it's in there, like it's in there and i'm like it was not like it's. And like when that happened, I felt like I could speak it again, but when I started getting better and getting back to like my normal state how I was before like. I couldn't come back to you know anything, it was weird like I just felt like I can do anything like during that time, like I like I felt like. I don't know like Michael Jackson or something like I could literally just like do anything like I don't know like I just like I just felt so artistic and so creative that. I can just do anything and like I could dance well again like it was just the weirdest feeling over so. When that happened I just felt like whoa like I didn't speak Spanish again like that was one of my traumas that like I just didn't want to deal with, and when I was okay with it like it was cool and then. yeah that was one of my biggest problems with my dad when I just didn't. It just yeah I just like literally it just like left my brain like I don't have any memories of my childhood really underneath like six or seven. Yes, and I remember bad memories like them fighting and stuff and me pretending you're not pretending me protecting. my brother and sister like behind the couch and my mom would tell me that, like when I was like maybe three I would literally changed my little sister's diaper and be like my dad daddy's on the couch passed out like I don't know what to do, like, I felt like. Even at a young age, I had so many like little responsibilities, even though I wasn't. Like I didn't I just felt like like I just needed to like help my little sister during that time, my mom would tell me that i'd be like wow like that's crazy like I just I don't know and even growing up like I remember, I had shared room with my brother and sister and. I were the room and get really messy and i'd like if you guys don't clean up after yourself i'm going to throw everything away because I was such like a neat and clean like organized person. And things like that, and then to and getting into high school I feel like with relationships like either like being cheated on a light on like lied to I feel like that was another. trauma that was. That been triggered in my head because i'm such a loyal person like I don't. I just don't get that have a mindset, how you can do that to people, you know and like feel okay with it or not, have like a guilty conscious so that's another thing that triggers me is like when I think something is happening, like those those past. Things kind of answer yeah."
760.0,Provider,So that's part of the overthinking you're.
14352.0,Patient,"Talking yes, yes okay so."
760.0,Provider,"So to work on your overthinking mindfulness do you have a normal practice or regular practice, or is it just kind of something you pull upon when you notice, you need it."
14352.0,Patient,"kind of both considering our work all day. And I talked to people all day you know it. It helps because i'm Listening to some. good listener, and I like to observe a lot so i'm more of an observer than someone trying to like us to the party or something. So, like I I like listening to people's which will not mean, of course, but it definitely helps that because I. learn a little bit like from different place speak to people all over the USA so it's like. I learned a little bit from each state and everything people's experiences and then, when I get off of work, I kind of have a routine where basically either like you know, take a shower or I. been around the House into during my our break I like to clean up around the House so that we went off like the House is just like. Clean it's good I don't need to do anything and then, after that, like, I can just chill and watch TV or whatever, but I feel like that's good but I need to get to a point where I need to do something like I actually want to feel like i'm good at something you know, like drawing or making."
760.0,Provider,Like you said yeah.
14352.0,Patient,"Yes, and I actually got a sewing machine for Christmas this year so like I really happy to ask. For it my one that lives in the town with me and he caught up for me, so I was super happy and stoked about i'm just trying to like learn it so. Yes, I got that so it's just like those little steps in to I feel like one of my major problems is like when I get everything going, like, for example, making clothes, I have everything in front of me I just I just like freeze and like I don't know like. I just like don't do it and, like, I know I need to do it it's just like getting to that step to do it, and my friends are like just do it. I know it just like I don't know it's just a major step to like get to, and I feel like one of my things like i'm such a perfectionist like I don't like to mess anything up, and I know like. bill sometimes to succeed, so like I feel like if I mess it up, I just feel like I just like I failed and I yes."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so that's why you're kind of paralyzed to start. yeah project because."
14352.0,Patient,"wrong or. yeah yeah and I feel like that's just such a bad excuse because it's like well, you have to just do it and you obviously have to like learn to like get where you're at and so like that's what i'm trying to like. step into is like all right just get the things out and just do it, and like I wanted, I was looking at videos how to like do the sewing machine and then after I watched a couple videos like my attention span, just like when I was like Okay, this is another day. So it's like like another situation that like as an example, like how I I don't know try to do something and then it doesn't follow through."
760.0,Provider,"But do you think, do you think you want to work through some of these cognitive distortions."
14352.0,Patient,"Do I really do and I, and I feel like i'm doing a lot better with my overthinking of like past trauma like I just like. To do like the cheating and lying and things like that so like that I just like to everything came up from my past so like when everything went down back in August, like. It just I don't know I thought this it was it was weird it felt like I guess that's where my stuff different year came in, because I would like not necessarily like hear voices, but like I would go back into my past and pull out basically like things that would. connect with things now. And I try not to do that anymore, because it's. In the past, and i'm over it so i'm just trying to not think about that and then trying to stay in the moment and then moving forward to do better, as in. You know, making clothes, for example. yeah."
760.0,Provider,Maybe maybe how about you mentioned spirituality So what about mindful meditation.
14352.0,Patient,"That actually I did actually start meditating a couple nights ago I just felt like I wanted to do it so into when we did the meditation on July July. January the fluidity of January, and that was really cool I really liked your voice so like when I. was going to bed, the next day like I kind of just like went back to your voice in my head and like it actually really helped me because. My mom she always taught me to do like meditation too, because just a few years ago she started to get into. spirituality and like astrology and things like that so she always told me certain things to do, like meditate on frequencies and things like that which it does help I just feel like I need to find like a really good like. I don't know podcast or spotify account for good some seminars or frequencies to meditate because sometimes when it's just silent for me. it's I know it's kind of hard so I kind of want to start off with like the the sounds are people's voices first and then really go into just."
760.0,Provider,"You I visited YouTube is full of meditation say. They have the instrumental type meditative musics. Okay, you know, and you know you can see Okay, this is a 10 minute medication meditation, this is a. yeah and you know, and you can kind of. See which one you like. Definitely. I know I could suggest that or you could. just put on some music."
14352.0,Patient,"meditate for. I feel like and there's no right position right, you can just be in any comfortable position because I feel like to like i'll start like the moving and then I. have to go back in the zone again and, like when you start start thinking under breathing and I feel like it's such a like good practice, but I really want to start practicing more because my brother he started meditating. And he was really into it and he said that he got into like a really good meditation state once and it was really cool so I really want to like like achieve that type of mindset."
760.0,Provider,"I got it is, it is a practice and. yeah, it is hard for many of us to kind of quiet, the mind down."
14352.0,Patient,Right oh yeah there's.
760.0,Provider,"I don't I think I think you can do it. Probably sitting up you want to make sure i'm not sitting right. But you want to be there, you want to make sure that your. You know your spine is you know you don't want it like to be like a board, but you want it to be. A relaxed, but with a straight spine feet flat on the."
14352.0,Patient,floor.
760.0,Provider,"Okay amy your palms like. resting in your lap. Okay it's also important to breathe through the nose, not through the mouth."
14352.0,Patient,You. me down.
760.0,Provider,"You can lay down. But no it's Okay, if you go to sleep."
14352.0,Patient,"At night because I. have to. fig like major like not major issue, but I feel like i've noticed within myself, because I had major surgery like when I was five, so I had my tonsils taken out and. Also to I was 75% death, I guess, when I was younger until I was like four or five I think then that yeah. and not in my family never really noticed that well they did or the point, but because I would look at their lips, and I would looked at like what they were saying so, I could read lips really well. And I guess, one day, I guess, I fell in kindergarten and I started bleeding and I was still speaking Spanish during the time and I guess I said I was bleeding and Spanish and, like my teacher didn't understand what I was saying, and then. They realized that day like I couldn't hear so I had major surgery, when I was five I tubes and my ears and then to my grandma my grandma and my mom always talked about how they never took out my adenoids. I don't know if that's how you say it, but it's something in your nostrils that healthy like that either it can. hurt you in a way, as in like breathing wise, because with me like I feel like I don't breathe enough and that's when I really want to work on my breathing with meditation because my nose like I feel like. I don't i'm more of like a mouth breather, I guess, I can say so, like I don't know if that like affected also my breathing and everything throughout by because I feel like to like when I get like anxiety I just. I just like hold everything in and I don't it's kind of stupid, I guess, to bring up like that, but it just it just like an observation."
760.0,Provider,"If you're having problems with. your nose, maybe that's something that you're going to need to address with your your your PCP."
14352.0,Patient,I mean yeah.
760.0,Provider,"You know, we you know, we do have breathing problems and breathing problems being can be caused by a bunch of things. yeah so. So that might be something for you to explore with the doctor."
14352.0,Patient,"yeah I think so, too, because when you said, like breathe, through your nose and the mouth like that's what it reminds me I can breathe Okay, through my nose and just Sometimes I feel like it's not enough, so I definitely should bring that up but yeah so it's also wanted to really practice."
760.0,Provider,"Some meditations call for like deep breathing okay. Read the best you can, if you if you have challenges with breathing, then you know brief how you have to breathe."
14352.0,Patient,You right ways.
760.0,Provider,to relax yourself.
14352.0,Patient,"Right and that's what my my breath and I told me like just breathe, and I was like Okay, and like sometimes I have to like take a step back and just breathe and two summers I feel like i'm not like it, but I am but, like you know it's actually inhale exhale and really. get into your brain. So yeah."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, so so as far as mindfulness do. You since I know you have a background and you've done some. study with spirituality do you. know what the two. The two main points of a mindful practice, do you know what the two basic most basic points of mindfulness are."
14352.0,Patient,i'm going to send a good ball that's I just like to stay in the present. Like to good yes. Good tuned with yourself to stay here.
760.0,Provider,To be in the present moment and then now.
14352.0,Patient,"Yes, and then I guess I don't know, is it like train your mind to. Just I just to be here, I don't know that that's like."
760.0,Provider,"Okay okay just you got the first one right. Okay, the first one being in the present moment is a big one, and. You will pay any attention to your thoughts your feelings. yeah and and also your senses. What okay what I smell what I. Okay, what I feel is feeling, as you know, I feel my calendar here on my desk and I. feel paper, the smoothness of the paper. Okay, and then the second one is non judgmental awareness."
14352.0,Patient,So what does that mean exactly.
760.0,Provider,hmm it is. A way of letting go of any judgment judgment of self judgment of others.
14352.0,Patient,No.
760.0,Provider,"judgment of a situation, perhaps. Okay, and taking a step back and like using like a curious using a curiosity to observe oneself."
14352.0,Patient,Instead of trying to.
760.0,Provider,Fight against something or penalized myself or change something or.
14352.0,Patient,"God should just accept that kind of to accept it, or just let it go."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, because emotions emotions flow emotions come emotions go and then, when."
14352.0,Patient,Yes.
760.0,Provider,When we crab on to them say the depression or the anxiety i'm now meeting that. And liking it. i'm making it larger in my experience.
14352.0,Patient,than what it is.
760.0,Provider,Having the opposite effect of what we want to do.
14352.0,Patient,"gotcha okay. Yes, i've been trying to like not keep my emotions there if i'm feeling, something I just tried to feel it and i've tried to let it go. yeah that's one thing that I try to do."
760.0,Provider,"And if you can't let it, though, you can simply make a. statement to within your own thinking this feeling is going to pass no feeling last forever emotions go. that's true, and so, then you okay so i'm just going to ride this wave. And i'm just going to kind of observe it. and be with."
14352.0,Patient,grizzly I love. Okay.
760.0,Provider,"So that sounds good that's I mean that's that's just kind of a little bit of a nutshell. And we will be talking about it a little bit more on Thursday, when when you come to grow. So. You know, you can do meditation but the other cool part of mindfulness. rosie is that you can do mindful activity you don't. sit still and meditate okay mindful chores. Mindful walk."
14352.0,Patient,"Okay, I also like I know that we talked about journaling and I love to journal like it's one of my major things that I like to do, I like I like doing my affirmations for myself every day."
760.0,Provider,And really just.
14352.0,Patient,"You know, really just like you know being good to. Myself, basically, and just writing down things, or like because when I was talking about spirituality and everything like I have this book and i'm a sagittarius before in December, so it has like sagittarius on it and. Even with therapy sessions i'll write down things like we've learned and everything that i'd like to learn about because you've been on my own time, like I like looking up like. You know, mental illnesses and learn more about myself to really you know how to take care of myself and everything so definitely a huge thing for me is journaling, so I do, that a lot, which helps because I can take it from here and put it."
760.0,Provider,"Okay, Nice, maybe it would be helpful for you to start to. question some of the things you believe. Okay, some of those. distortions that we can."
14352.0,Patient,"yeah yeah okay i'll do that because I do like i'll type of all the positive things, but sometimes like not all my all my thoughts are positive thinking and. I feel like I do need to like write down like he said, like questions or things like just like get it off my mind and just put it on there."
760.0,Provider,"And if you apply mindfulness. To that process you're going to take a step back and say oh I seem to be believing this. create the the curious mind, we talked. About and observe it from another perspective."
14352.0,Patient,got it okay okay.
760.0,Provider,"Instead, and you know, and if you're having a hard time you you just say oh I seem to be holding on to this belief."
14352.0,Patient,Just it's it's a practice and you're going to be.
760.0,Provider,you're going to be good at doing it certain days and then other days are going to be more challenging.
14352.0,Patient,Right.
760.0,Provider,"And I have to go with that flow kind of go with that moment. Okay, no. yeah so cuz I think you know your seem to be a type of person who likes to. Studies or analyzes and and you know that can be that can be a huge strength."
14352.0,Patient,yeah.
760.0,Provider,"You know, but if it's used destructively it can be really hard on once."
14352.0,Patient,Right okay.
760.0,Provider,So finding a way to use that as my strength.
14352.0,Patient,instead.
760.0,Provider,Of as something that's hurting me. Okay So how do you think you could do that. How do you think that would work for you.
14352.0,Patient,"I feel like maybe instead of thinking about negative thoughts or situations or like things brought myself, I could write that down and then like you said analyze it in a way, where. Like it's just a thought, maybe like you said, basically, just like go off like what you believe in and see maybe let it go um how How would I do that, like."
760.0,Provider,You know. It all comes down. To exceptions roshi.
14352.0,Patient,yeah okay.
760.0,Provider,"Thank you, you get bothered you get bothered by certain things you said it yourself. You don't understand how. how people can be mean to other people. yeah because other people have a different perception indoors."
14352.0,Patient,And that's not a positive thing right.
760.0,Provider,"positive thing so that's not something you want to emulate spot, there are other people that see the world differently in a way that's more beneficial to them. Maybe even more beneficial in their relationships."
14352.0,Patient,Right.
760.0,Provider,"Okay Oh, and so understanding that. there's another way of proceeding this."
14352.0,Patient,gahcho instead of just one way there's other.
760.0,Provider,"ways. That, as this is what I thinking, this is what i'm feeling. This is right and i'm stuck on this thought, and then there goes my thoughts. gotcha whirling So what is the other way to see this."
14352.0,Patient,"I guess, to be more open about certain things and to not think of it as like a one way street, you know and not thinking everything you think is right, because I feel like. I feel like I sometimes have that that trait right like i'm right, but then I have other friends were like. it's like worse and like she always thinks she's right but i'm like no and like I always kind of I don't know it's kind of weird but like. I could go back to like overthinking like if I think it's true like it's true but, like you said you have to have different perception to it so definitely think in a different way and with."
760.0,Provider,"Just the question is there, another way of viewing the situation."
14352.0,Patient,"Yes, like."
760.0,Provider,that's that's like a curious mind like what we talked about.
14352.0,Patient,"yeah yes, because no all of it is is true right I don't I don't know yeah. yeah because I just I don't know I don't know how to answer it I feel like i'm kind of stuck."
760.0,Provider,"But i'm just i'm just saying, these are the kinds of language that you can say to yourself as your."
14352.0,Patient,Scotch okay.
760.0,Provider,"cognitive, this is the question that rosie is going to ask the rosie is there, another way of viewing this situation."
14352.0,Patient,Asking someone else.
760.0,Provider,take a deep breath be mindful and ask yourself that question with the observation. feeling overwhelmed.
14352.0,Patient,yeah that's what i'm feeling right now okay. Okay okay i'm wrong.
760.0,Provider,No just just asking that question because we talked about cognitive distortions which. means multi perception.
14352.0,Patient,Yes. I get I don't I don't know I feel like. I feel like i'm wrong I don't know what even to say.
760.0,Provider,You feel you're wrong.
14352.0,Patient,yeah like I don't know what to say like I do what you're saying like I don't know how to like. I don't know how to flip it like how to look at it in a.
760.0,Provider,With that.
14352.0,Patient,Question yeah.
760.0,Provider,"At the moment. yeah in the moment. When when you have this thought that goes through your head that you know it's likely a cut there's a part of you that might know it's a cognitive distortion of some sort. And then there's that other part that believes it so you simply think the thought is there, another way of perceiving this and try to practice your mind. In there. Use your senses. Your thinking your emotions and your feet take a deep breath."
14352.0,Patient,yeah I feel blocked.
760.0,Provider,"Okay, then, then."
14352.0,Patient,"Then you it's just a question I don't know if it's bothering me that I don't know what the what the other end like you don't answer is, but how to. answer it I don't know."
760.0,Provider,"A mindful practice Okay, I feel blocked so. To be with that observe what."
14352.0,Patient,i'm trying to like.
760.0,Provider,"Do my life is kind of like when I go to when i've gone to math class in the bed I. watched the teacher, I think I got it and then I don't got it and I kind of fight it sometimes I have to watch the teacher do the problem multiple times before I start to understand."
14352.0,Patient,Yes.
760.0,Provider,"Yes, and so mindfulness can be a little bit like that, like. Okay practicing practicing it so that it can become more a part of you."
14352.0,Patient,"Okay gotcha That was a good example because I was terrible and not so. I never liked that subject, and even if I tried so hard to get it like I just couldn't get and I always envied people that mind could get mapped so well, like my friend, she does. math really well and i'm like, how do you do that, you know with my mind just doesn't work that way, like so they say you know. And I just feel like I just like math is just not fun, so I guess we all like you said, if you see my problem and need to practice it more and more I guess yeah just like to practice. More and more, and just really just be in 200 yourself, I guess, and just kind of move forward in like small steps."
760.0,Provider,Big wherever you're at if i'm feeling overwhelmed if i'm feeling blocked. curious observation.
14352.0,Patient,Observation okay okay.
760.0,Provider,"And we will talk about it again in a couple of days to okay. So that would be something maybe journaling on that. Okay, mindful practice I don't know if you like, the idea of mindful chores."
14352.0,Patient,"In that I like. I like that I like doing dishes and I know, like a lot of people don't like doing dishes but, like, I personally like doing it. Definitely how short is this semester mindful tours I like doing like laundry fish do the basic things it makes me feel good because, like you did that you kind of like you know reward yourself mentally and book I did that, basically, and then to like. Even just like taking a shower and like having like a routine and stuff like that helps a lot because, like you know you're putting you know self care and everything to yourself, and then, after that, like I have curly hair so like I like. Doing products my hair just really taking everything like step by step, and yeah and I like doing makeup and everything so. I like to do that with like mindfulness like really just focus, like all my makeup and everything and to just really decide no like I feel like. When I started working again like I kind of lost like my creativity with like certain things, and like that's what i'm trying to like gain back and fight for again for. Myself, because I feel like a lot of time to taken away by working so you can like pay bills and everything so i'm just trying to keep a mindset that you know it is a job at least you know you're getting your bills paid, but then again try to do something that you'd like to do."
