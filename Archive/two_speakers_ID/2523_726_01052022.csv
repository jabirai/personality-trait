Oh yeah for my workout with it's a pretty nice one just been been exercising a lot more, I feel like i've really. been committing actually committing to it. But I need to get a scale to see if i'm getting any gains. yeah I felt like at times during the holidays, I did feel like I felt like I had thoughts of relaxing but I know I didn't I know that's not what I want to do. I guess sometimes things get stressful. I don't know it's hard to explain. Real quick sorry."
726.0,Provider,Okay.
2523.0,Patient,"When I started, you know I seen a doctor through you guys and. I got I started taking antidepressants like."

726.0,Provider,"Okay, yes."
2523.0,Patient,"yeah so yeah but I don't really feel any different take on it honestly. it's it's probably barely getting to the two week mark. Oh, it hasn't been long enough to you know it takes a month sometime for to notice a difference in behavior but. I don't know i'm just gonna try i'm going to just try to. yeah improve my quality of life, basically."
726.0,Provider,"stressful i'm. Just because of personal stuff and we're just in general, because of the sea."
2523.0,Patient,"I think. i've been stressed out because of my you know my kids mother started using after i'm talking like after being claimed for. Clean for like 12 or 13 years. And that was really surprising. And kind of shacked up with a new guy that is pretty well known for beer and i'm you know, a dealer like I know what's going on it's a small town, you know. And I know it's i've never outright said it to her i've had a couple times. and told her you know if I need to pick up my kid i'll pick them up anytime you know. I just don't want things to get out of control over there. i'm talking 13 years ago. She like before I ever was into drugs at all really I. She was doing math and when she first got pregnant I kicked like six or seven people out of a house instantly you know kind of a drug house, because we were you know we're quitting drugs and wasn't really doing drugs, I was just drinking. pretty much at that time, but. I felt. You know I felt like that was what had to be done at that time and. I don't know feel real disconnected with her. she's a really mean person. The main fucking bitch. See so mean to her new every boyfriend I know her I have relationships with her boyfriends that she's had in the past. Just because of their. You know. Their baby's Daddy I knew him since I was a kid and she's just really mean I mean she's a phlebotomist. I don't want to see her lose her job. she's not quite at that point, but you know there's everything gets out of control, it doesn't matter who you are."
726.0,Provider,yeah happens pretty quickly.
2523.0,Patient,yeah so I just worry.
726.0,Provider,yeah how's your son.
2523.0,Patient,"he's doing good. he's just for he's really spoiled. I know I I worry about that. that's pretty much anything and everything yes motorcycles and has every game system, you can imagine, and i'll focus cuter and I think some of these things worry me because I feel like hardship breeds hardship breeds. breeds more successful people you know. yeah noted. Like i've had my family. My dad grew up dirt poor you know working he's working on a farm, since he was like eight or nine and his dad like two generations before that they were rich and then poor before that, and I feel like. I think feel like generations of people there it's like a cycle of rich and poor rich and poor it's because people the experience hardship know how to you know work hard and save money, and you know resistance for for their family."
726.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
2523.0,Patient,"which, I hope I feel like i'm in the middle of that like. I feel like I have a good work mentality, I definitely wasn't spoiled growing up, I never had anything given to me i'm always always grew up with a mentality, I had to work for everything. and luckily my family had you know businesses to where I was able to work. Doing More a lot of different forestry stuff. Now i'm kind of an aspiring to. i'm going to start making I have a lot of old growth material old growth borough i'm going to start making custom furniture, which I didn't know how to do and i've done in the past and."
726.0,Provider,yeah.
2523.0,Patient,"yeah I would make templates I would take different kinds of resins and. I can make you know natural edge tables, I can make you know square whatever size, I make templates that I actually could take four different pieces of wood and use a you know, like a resin."
726.0,Provider,And yeah.
2523.0,Patient,"It would be all you know it would be resident in the middle it's beautiful and then I take it to a I take it to a professional shop, probably in your HR medford and use their some of their equipment, the plane it. yeah, but we, we have a professional sawmill here a pretty big sawmill. So I just I want to use what I have at my disposal. To be successful."
726.0,Provider,"won't be making furniture, I mean it's very hard. So."
2523.0,Patient,"furniture in the past for a few thousand dollars. Like i've made some 3000 $4,000 tables and I made some life, I made a lot of life sculpture sculptures. Like you know would cross specialty wood carving it's really hard and there's no proper way to learn it and. I learned it through a guy when I was doing drugs, you know we're. we're doing drugs and cut. You know carve wood."
726.0,Provider,And it was like.
2523.0,Patient,"that's not my don't like, but I want to make a building and just do it by myself. My family or kid wants to do it, we could do that. I don't know we'll see I hope I could do some individually, where i'm working for myself. And this, I don't want to depend on other people. And you know I only leave the House a couple times a month. But like two or three times a month. If it's not working that's yeah I don't leave very much."
726.0,Provider,yeah.
2523.0,Patient,Basically I don't know I I don't know if that's how I handled by sobriety maybe.
726.0,Provider,You feel like. Is it just that it doesn't present itself to. Get out of your space or it's more like you want to be in your space also.
2523.0,Patient,"want to be in my space. I don't even socialize on the Internet at all. yeah I thought about it. I thought about socializing with the premise that you know hard you know no drugs, and I will not tolerate being around drugs or anybody being high. Even you know. yeah I do want to date, and I do want to I miss haven't I used, you know I used to have a big group of friends that I socialized with and tell my you know late 20s and. You know, got in the heroin and most of them moved out way out of town or just do their own thing but. yeah kinda want to start over in that area. yeah that's really hard."
726.0,Provider,Once you're there yeah.
2523.0,Patient,it's hard to make friends.
726.0,Provider,"it's so easy when you're young like in school it's like once you have work, family it's."
2523.0,Patient,"Like. Because i'm real skeptical a new people as. well. Like I just. I have a lot of fear of you know, the. You know somebody I don't know because I guess i've had enough experience in life, where I just don't trust people for the most part. And that's a good way I feel like that's a good mentality to have. kind of a defensive mentality, you know because. Oh i've you know i've been in areas where you just have. people walking over to you know sizing you up trying to steal stuff i've been in really bad areas where. Just there's so many drugs and just bad fucking people around and. it's drugs in general it's just fucking shitty people. yeah no I don't want to be that I don't want to be associated with that and. And even like drug dealers that's fucking even worse because I was kind of a mix of dealing drugs to support my habit I guess. Like a low fucking totem pole fucking. doing it to support my habit and. I just hate that I just wish our country would do something different to get drugs off the street I don't know but."
726.0,Provider,it's hard. To get everywhere.
2523.0,Patient,"It is, it is really bad when I look around, I mean God spoke and it's really getting out of hand."
726.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
2523.0,Patient,"But I hope that I don't know if it's like that air everywhere, but crescent city it's freaking bad. Just kids everywhere people sleeping on a sidewalk, and this is a small town. And me is almost like oh gosh there's only like 8000 88,000 people here."
726.0,Provider,I mean goodness wow. wow.
2523.0,Patient,looks like that.
726.0,Provider,yeah. Right.
2523.0,Patient,"yeah, but I feel like I feel empowered now that my kids mothers doing drugs, I feel, almost doubled down that I won't use because. I don't feel like that one of us have to be fucking sober definitely if that makes sense. Men so on our relationship, I think we've used to go there, like 15 years ago before our kid was born and. God. yeah we haven't had a romantic relationship for over a decade and just I know better, I know, to stay away from her I. I wasn't the type to get abuse, I guess, by by my partner if that makes sense. yeah I didn't put up with that shit and just yeah we had a lot of physical my worst domestic disputes i've ever had in my life, because with her and after that I never had no problems in my relationships and I had you know pretty long a couple long relationships were. Older and wiser I guess."
726.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
2523.0,Patient,"Like i've been to jail, you know for domestic a few times and God that was just I look back on it now and i'm just like. yeah."
726.0,Provider,"You learned from it, oh. Some people. The choice you made the choice to not repeat. The same patterns and that's a big thing."
2523.0,Patient,"yeah yeah. Well, I left she was clinically depressed at one time and i'm talking like. Just a lot of sleeping and laying in bed, and I had I couldn't do it anymore, and I had. Really felt bad it wasn't like I left her for another women woman, I didn't date anyone for almost a year after that. yeah but. yeah I like took my kid and last and. And then she went to Texas, for over a year and I had no contact with them for over a year, with no Texas or phone calls and I feel like that kind of really screwed screwed me up mentally. yeah trusting women because I don't feel I never really did anything to deserve that I was always a really good I was a good dad. Even when even on drugs, I didn't do drugs around my kids I mean there's not any better, I was high around with my kid. that's not good. And i'm just glad to be past that point in my life."
726.0,Provider,"yeah I think you're doing you know being at the position where you're at now in your life, I think you know."
2523.0,Patient,yeah.
726.0,Provider,yeah I think.
2523.0,Patient,"that's pretty good. yeah I hope I mature and hope I. Just can keep it together and i'm always very hyper aware, I feel like. You know the consequences of our actions. Unfortunately, and. God, in the past, I. I was like you know homeless for."
726.0,Provider,so hard.
2523.0,Patient,"All year you know, I was like really I had to be a really crazy looking person that guy you know screaming doing by him, you know screaming on the corner themselves. yeah I have no joke that's how far out there, I was at one point or two yeah. Where you don't realize the abnormal becomes normal I suppose. yeah. i've been. Watch stuff on TV like. Oh, the possessive case where I watched a lot of like trying stuff and I see stuff where it's like this is the trash is you know house that they've ever seen, and I, I can see that and say i've honestly been in worse places. Like real hoarders you know episodes like. yeah and it. But it feels good to move up in society from that low because that was horrible where I would, I would say, because before I was homeless, you know I had a house and vehicles and. You know I had a live tonight you know winter, you know always went to baseball."
726.0,Provider,Sorry. Do you think that the self sabotaging is partly to do with the belief that things have to be hard.
2523.0,Patient,For you.
726.0,Provider,To succeed.
2523.0,Patient,"Maybe I don't know really I. yeah like I still even being sober I still think about using a lot and I like. Daddy ways of. I even study ways of like I know how to get on the dark web and. How to get drugs that way even and i'm like Oh, why do I think about this kind of stuff and i'm doing that, as a hobby at night. And i'm not really doing it, but."
726.0,Provider,yeah you're curious.
2523.0,Patient,"yeah yeah and i'm like Oh well, I could save money, and I can make a bunch of money because I found out about it because everyone's too stupid around here to do that and. yeah but i'm not i'm not gonna do that, but I feel like I like. hey."
726.0,Provider,breaking up a little bit i'm not get what you were saying.
2523.0,Patient,"i'm Sir. Well that's Okay, can you hear me."
726.0,Provider,"Yes, I can hear you now yeah. I. Some of the things that. You can you hear me."
2523.0,Patient,Can you hear me.
726.0,Provider,I can hear you can you hear me.
2523.0,Patient,yeah I turned my video off.
726.0,Provider,To see if that would know oh yeah.
2523.0,Patient,i'm sorry about that.
726.0,Provider,Right.
2523.0,Patient,yeah but then I get enjoyment out of researching and I guess fantasize about that. I don't know.
726.0,Provider,What is it about your old life that. You are feeling like you're missing.
2523.0,Patient,"um I feel like I don't get my kid and I I not really not saying it's because of that, but I feel like oh i'm a bachelor I live like. Why not just do drugs and I get in my head. yeah I get thinking, I can control it, I guess, and I know i'm I do it, I can't."
726.0,Provider,No yeah.
2523.0,Patient,I know I know it's not mine gonna do just on Saturday and Sunday and.
726.0,Provider,"we'll just remember it's like. Think about it this way it's like. um you your mind when you're thinking about certain things it's like either you're feeding the beast or you're feeding the the good part so like. Like I think it's totally completely normal to have thoughts about it, because you live, to look at life before you know what it's like, but the reality is even if you were to do it it's not gonna be it's not going to be different. You know, made you back you know. But, but I understand where you're talking about like I think everybody will have thoughts like Oh, I could all the possibilities of what could."
2523.0,Patient,"yeah I guess I don't know, but I feel like as of right now i'm on a really good path, and I feel really stable. So I hope it I feel like, if I could just keep it up and get like a year sober like. That would say something on its own, and I don't want to. Like you know not that long ago I fell out for a month and I had that relapse and that that really scared me. As I was doing it, I know i'm doing something wrong. yeah. yeah. But. I other thoughts I had I thinking about moving, but I don't think I could be prosperous moving as I live, you know I live on, I told you about I live on 120 acres. Like my family and my dad. My dad and. My uncle is like on his deathbed pretty much I constantly have to go hey constantly just slips and falls on a face and gets all bloodied up and. refuses to the hospital and refused muted and he's got his ammonia MOT ammonia levels."
726.0,Provider,Get her he doesn't know what the Fuck is going on and.
2523.0,Patient,it's just kind of sad I don't know I think they need to I would have put them in a home.
726.0,Provider,I. It sounds like he needs to 24 hour care and yeah just a good i'm not a good caretaker and you got a guy with parkinson's taking care of them oh yeah.
2523.0,Patient,"But I don't mind like. I don't know I love my uncle but I guess we're not close enough like I would do that for my parents. yeah I would do that for my sister and my kid and that's about it. I can't I can't take care, everybody."
726.0,Provider,"And it's you know it's important to take care of your own needs, you know. If you're not 100%. it's it's it's impossible to help anybody else Constable."
2523.0,Patient,"yeah yeah. yeah that's why I wanna I. want to develop a successful career and you know have my license and have vehicles, and I want to be able to be in a position to help my kid if he's in trouble somewhere, you know. be able to actively help my family, and I know if I was on drugs, I would just end up going to jail, and you know i've had legal i've had you know i've been to jail, quite a few times, if I get in trouble again it's probably going to be worse, I imagine, because it's. My if you look at like my rap sheet it just looks like i'm a violent thief basically. Oh yes. yeah that's what it looks like."
726.0,Provider,"It sounds like you have the option, though, to be your own. yeah which may be. A lot more flexibility to. Do something for yourself."
2523.0,Patient,"yeah true yeah and I do work right now but I don't feel I feel like I need something more challenging. and We haven't been working for a couple weeks because of the weather and it's just really deep snow right now and places so. Just unable to work it work right now, so I have been a little a little stir crazy, I guess, been just inside."
726.0,Provider,that's why you're thinking about all the possibilities. Because you've been home.
2523.0,Patient,"yeah yeah. I love working. When i'm you know when i'm out all up, and when I go up in the mountains or working or cutting wood all day or doing something productive I. sleep so much better and feel some I feel like have a better appetite and just all around just it seems. yeah. When i'm working full time and having a good income I get a really big mental boost from it, I guess. yeah like feeling successful I suppose. But I used to I used to have like a bad gambling addiction and I spent so much money and I just did a lot of things I should know, in the past. But it didn't matter how much money, I was making you know."
726.0,Provider,"Right, I want to. Make sure we have an appointment for two weeks from today okay. Okay, look at me. here. We are on Fridays, or would you be available in the morning. I have a 90 am on."

2523.0,Patient,"yeah yeah good having good progress, I feel like."
726.0,Provider,"And I think I would challenge your your thought like, how can you learn through joyful experiences, rather than just having things being hard to learn it. As I think. Because, if you think about that's a belief system and your belief is that. Things have to be hard in order for you to learn it."
2523.0,Patient,"yeah yeah yeah that's true that we created, it will create problems, just so that we can learn something or."
726.0,Provider,"You know, understand something."
2523.0,Patient,"yeah I have, I feel like in my work history even like i've never held a job longer than like three years anywhere. lag really bored like a if I master something I get bored and."
726.0,Provider,yeah.
2523.0,Patient,i've almost always done better and in positions of power like supervisor or. manager and manage managing things I don't know why I always. seem to. gives me a sense of importance I guess. I gotta get up and do this because there's you know there's you know 20 guys depending on me yeah. get them going.
