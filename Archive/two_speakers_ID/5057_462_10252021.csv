462.0,Provider,"hi amy. Can you hear me. Yes, okay very good, how are you doing."
5057.0,Patient,stressed out.
462.0,Provider,yeah what's going on with you.
5057.0,Patient,"My baby's Daddy again. Heidi for about two years now she's had different coaches and different teachers and counselors tell me that she's ADHD but I wasn't ready to medicate her. Well, this year the teacher was having a hard time with her, she was being bullied I didn't know that usually ADHD people are kids stick out because they're always in your face and so they're away getting bullied and picked on. So i've i've learned a lot. And she. She does she mothers every child and know fifth grader likes to be mothered period definitely not by a kid."
462.0,Provider,Absolutely.
5057.0,Patient,"So I went to her pediatrician and he said okay you either have a choice to go through all the testing. Or we can try her on meditation because he was watching her, and he you know she was shaking all over the place and couldn't focus and told him that she took one of her state test and. told him that she just filled out all the circles and didn't even read a question because she can't pay attention. Okay, and our teachers have been writing to me saying, she can't pay attention she won't do work, so of course I have to report to her father. And I said listen hattie's tryin ADHD medication absolutely not you're a horrible mother, this is. This is the first thing we ever disagree on which he disagrees with. me about."
462.0,Provider,bugs bunny yeah.
5057.0,Patient,"So he hung up on me. And he's always telling me don't let how to hear adult conversations in his adult conversations mean rides you know, to pick caddy up and drop her off and. different things about school or doctor's appointments Those are the things that he's talking about adult conversation. Well, he called hattie that same are the next morning after we seen the doctor and he said hattie do not tell your mother i'm telling you this, but do not take your medication."
462.0,Provider,Oh no oh no okay.
5057.0,Patient,"But I didn't react and I didn't respond I didn't want to put Heidi in that. And I felt like. i'm already in control here. You know, and then there's a medication that she can go on from an offer from."
462.0,Provider,Okay.
5057.0,Patient,"So. I hadn't heard from him, and she said that she wants to call him again Saturday night and he said well i'm not opposed to you being on medication for ADHD, but I think a psychiatry should handle that. And this is what he's telling her and i'm like. Still inappropriate."
462.0,Provider,yeah I mean to tell us to give instructions about medication to a child is beyond inappropriate and actually dangerous.
5057.0,Patient,"Yes, so last night. I feel like and and i've talked to her old social worker who's dealt with TIM and how do you hold counselors because I went kind of spinning out of control, about it because I was like oh my word like am I doing something wrong in my bad so. I last night he text me, would you like to have a conversation about. about what is going on with Heidi and I said and I was so proud of myself because normally I would feed into that and that would go on for a long time, and I would be upset and I said no, but you're more than welcome to call her pediatrician Dr Ross. i'm not I don't you know what i'm not a doctor I can't explain to him all everything you know and i'm not the psychiatrist or a psychologist but he can be informed and educated through a doctor."
462.0,Provider,"That was a really big step that you took their to not respond in a situation where like you said you are a doctor you aren't a prescriber of any sort and. He made it clear already that he was gonna disrespect to the boundaries and just kind of weave around the situation in whichever way he wanted to. And when that happens it's really hard not to just react, but it sounds like using a lot of the. skills that we've talked about in group and that you've learned in therapy you, you were able to pause and take a step back and just say. You know what this isn't my job to educate him and to inform them about what's going on, and it is his daughter, so he should have you know equal communication with doctors pediatricians psychiatrists whatever it may be, not just you being the middleman having to explain everything."
5057.0,Patient,Right. Yes.
462.0,Provider,"And so that's a fair perspective that you have and more than anything, you were just able to control your very fair emotions, especially when you're being called a bad mother, which is very hurtful. it's very hard to control yourself in that situation, so how are you feeling now about statements like that, and just making this decision."
5057.0,Patient,"um I. I don't know I had a really hard time like I still had a hard time controlling myself, especially when he called Heidi and told her not to take her medication."
462.0,Provider,that's really inappropriate yeah.
5057.0,Patient,"Right. So I and he he always wants a reaction from me and he knows where to hit me. And he knows what will happen, so I felt like not responding was getting to him a lot more and not doing as he tells me to do like i've always done in the past and listening to the health professionals, so I guess I feel good because i'm letting him deal with tisha and not taking it."
462.0,Provider,"On. You are yeah that's huge you know you've you have dealt with this ship, for a long time now and you've decided to just take a step back and let the health, health professionals. do their job, and you know you've obviously thought a lot about this, because you didn't put her on medication right away, you let it. kind of pan out and then you've got teachers telling you hey here's what's what's going on you've got your daughter being bullied you've got. You know, all these situations popping up testing just really important things that are kind of glaringly saying hey she can't focus, there needs to be some type of an intervention. And you know you have to as a parent make an educated decision on that. And you've thought about it and you didn't just jump on and go for medication right away, which is good, you, you really did take the time to think about it and. Ideally you'd have an equal partner who you could have a nice conversation with about it but. You don't have that support from him unfortunately and he's he's doing his way and so you just have to try your best and that's what you're doing so. Huge high fives to you really for just stepping back letting the professionals do their job caring for your daughter, being a wonderful mother and protecting your own emotions as well yeah."
5057.0,Patient,Thank you.
462.0,Provider,"it's hard to do it's very, very difficult, do you feel a little proud of yourself, for it."
5057.0,Patient,"I do feel proud of myself, but my brain spins in oh gosh is he going to have DHS here, which I don't mind I kind of. I wouldn't mind them being involved to you know to kind of see what we have to go through."
462.0,Provider,And you know just hearing that someone's giving a child instructions about taking medications wrong that would be a good thing.
5057.0,Patient,"Right and I guess you know my head spins to oh God we're going to go to court again over this type of matter, but then i'm thinking what judges going to tell me that i'm wrong, you know and and like. I looked up the laws on, of course, the doctor already knows, but he's like do you want her to go through testing amy or do you want to just try her on medication and then he you know cuz he examined tatty and he could see it like right away. So."
462.0,Provider,"I mean yeah again you're just you're thinking about it you're doing the best you can taking it day by day and then you've got someone you're going up against hopefully like you said you said. there's this fear a little bit of having to go back to court and everything but you're just doing everything right from what you're telling me and just trying to care for howdy and provide the best possible support. In a tough situation it's not easy, you know i'm sure it's very hurtful for you to hear that your daughter's being bullied and that she's struggling in school."
5057.0,Patient,Right. Yes.
462.0,Provider,"yeah and how has how has the bullying been addressed, if at all, have you talked to your your daughter, the school."
5057.0,Patient,I kind of I guess you could call me that helicopter parent when it comes to my child and yeah i've been right at the school in the principal's office in emails right with her and with a teacher right on top of it.
462.0,Provider,"yeah I mean. it's not necessary, I know that there's this helicopter parent, you know stereotype but. What do you do, do you just not get involved right, I mean it might seem overboard but communication can be really helpful, of course, you can't. go to school with your daughter and go through the entire day with her, she has this level of independence and having to kind of face the world but being contact with teachers and school officials is is not such a bad such a bad thing. Right actually shows shows a good level of involvement on your end so yeah you're working through a really tough a really tough scenario a tough situation."
5057.0,Patient,"Yes, and since I am so involved the principal has put me in charge of a few things at school. You know so. She says hey you're Nice, and you know, everybody wants to hear the kids love yo so."
462.0,Provider,"that's a great compliment to you, you know it just shows you are putting in your best and. it's nice for you to be able to be there throughout some of the day, too, and just kind of keep tabs of what's going on, especially during this time, where she's in between being medicated and kind of adjusting to this new this new thing and coping with having a dd or ADHD."
5057.0,Patient,"You should just say naret sports. She was on fire, all the parents were like wow what happened, she is going to be amazing and they were like. where's had where's hattie you know, and of course I didn't say she's on medication, but they're like that girls. She was spoken to be really good yeah."
462.0,Provider,"You know, sometimes you just need a boost and it doesn't have to mean she's on medication permanently for life, but maybe just right now she needs that boost to be able to get through school. And right fifth grade right before middle school is a really tough time it's going to be big transitions things change academically and get a little bit more challenging as you move through middle school and high school so. You know you're being a good mom thinking about it and just doing the best you can. yeah so now you're even busier though you're you're at the school you got the sports you I know you do hair part time, I believe, how about self care. Are you getting any time."
5057.0,Patient,i'm going for a massage today.
462.0,Provider,awesome okay that's exactly what you should be doing so you're growing a little bit of self care time getting massage how's your leg and your foot.
5057.0,Patient,um it's doing better I want in my boot anymore it's sometimes well but not like it was. Before.
462.0,Provider,"Okay, good so that's healing up a little bit yeah you you've really had a lot on your plate these last couple months yeah. Taking that little time just even to sneak away and get a massage is that good is a good start for that self care. And how do you feel your anxiety depression and and levels are for everything right now."
5057.0,Patient,"I don't, I guess, I feel just irritated and irritable. Right now, with the whole at ease dead."
462.0,Provider,bubble sure.
5057.0,Patient,That is the one feeling that is very prominent right now mm hmm.
462.0,Provider,What helps you release that a little bit.
5057.0,Patient,"i'm kind of like just was like if I watch netflix or you know don't focus on my life focus on, you know and it's usually has to be like happy romantic movies, or something like that and. escape yeah."
462.0,Provider,"Good well, maybe you try to on the weekend, or when you do have extra time just throw in an extra hour to. Allowing yourself to have that little bit of escape to release the anger like you can just step away from it and enjoy that time without it. The more opportunity, you get to step away from that anger, the more you'll just get back to feeling like yourself right now the anger is valid it's a ridiculous situation, you are not getting the support that should be gotten from. her father, but try to step away from the anger more and more each day, so you can just step away from it, at least once a day, even if just for one minute, you can. Get yourself to a place where you're not feeling that anger, you can start to move closer to just getting away from it, if that makes sense."
5057.0,Patient,"Yes, and i've been listening to meditation just relaxing music and just kind of getting into a zone of. You know i'll start thinking, but like you said, my thoughts come and go they're not just. One thing or i'll notice and then try to switch it so. Good that's."
462.0,Provider,"Perfect so helpful yeah those are great coping skills so just keep doing that, even in the tough times, we still have to put that effort in. Let the anger be there it's again it's valid we can't just always push down our emotions or ignore them, but then still see if you can at least once a day just try to step away from it. Like you said turn some of that music on reframe the thoughts, a little bit and eventually you'll be able to kind of work through it, which is actually better than just shoving it down and ignoring it so good work there."
5057.0,Patient,Thank you.
462.0,Provider,"Okay, so. got a lot on your plate. Anything else that you wanted to share today talk about process through anything that I can support you with."
5057.0,Patient,um no not really I think that's pretty much it going on in life.
462.0,Provider,"Okay, all right well and that is a lot, so if you ever feel like you need an extra. Appointment or a little bit of extra time to talk and reconnect or if you feel like you're slipping back into that reactive place or that place where you're not protecting your emotions or your mental health, then feel free to just let me know and we can book that okay. yeah so, then we can book you for November okay. let's see how about Monday November 29 at the same time. So 10:30am on the 29th. of November. hey so got you in for that. yeah otherwise it looks like surveys are looking good and everything else so. Good work and especially for you just moving forward in the way that you're responding to people and choosing to let professionals explain things that they need to explain and not having to put yourself in that position yeah."
5057.0,Patient,yeah okay exciting.
462.0,Provider,"All right, it is it's such a relief right it really changes your life when you just say i'm not going to do that that's not my job. Right take step back. yeah okay well good work there amy I will see you next time in group."
