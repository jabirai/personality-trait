226.0,Provider,You know yeah yeah just make sure you try and do you go to the virtual clinic.
12244.0,Patient,"yeah yeah usually I have to do it like half an hour. yeah takes them a while to to do it and I forgot about it and it's like oh. yeah just set up, but I also I actually usually I get up and then I go to the best man I just you know do it for thing and I just totally forgot to do it okay yeah."
226.0,Provider,How are you doing in the call cozy and warm.
12244.0,Patient,yeah it's it's been encoded in the middle and little tiny little bit warmer the past few days for that. yeah. it's very nice right now actually. We didn't we didn't have very nice red or we had a lot of rain. yeah right now it's actually really nice.
226.0,Provider,Okay how's that how's everything going.
12244.0,Patient,"is openly i've had a lot of rough letter refusing to rocky you know, like rocky road like into prefer all kinds of things like everything. Is the same thing there's so many obstacles everywhere it's just so. yeah I have this job, and I think I told you end up in San Francisco and, like the complete thing has just become clean D and I I know now why it's not working at night it's because they are actually repairing. tracks and they are. Like sometimes the train is just sitting on the tracks for like 40 minutes and movie you know, so my commute becomes two hours. happened or i'd like for one time somebody took me by car over the bridge and then I have to go from there and I had to end up biting because at that time at that day, though, like last week, I had a big box and the elevator in the Bart station wasn't working. So I think like. box and Mike bike there's no way for me really to use to you, he can you hear me. yeah yeah. there's no way for me to use the the stairs I can't get up the stairs so I had to bake those whatever that is 1010 miles so something home. Like. Things have been really difficult in that sense, like i'm just like I don't know and then. Now, this was Museum has decided, like that's The one thing the commute, and I mean, I think I do need to learn how to drive and see if I can at least start off with one of these these there's this company called the cars it's like a. Car sharing thing at least to be able to use it sometimes. And then see how that goes but it's like. I just have to I don't know you know, I have to make the time to to to do it, I have to make the time to client like to have to find somebody who can teach me driving and then I have to pay for it and you know things like that. And yeah and then I mean it's just all things that can't happen by tomorrow, you know, like none of that is this is going to happen within the next few couple months or so. right that I needed right now, or you know so. yeah."
226.0,Provider,i'm wondering about like make like starting to make steps to. get there.
12244.0,Patient,"yeah that's what i'm thinking to I have to try and at least find somebody. At least put the word out, and you know I it doesn't necessarily have to be a driving school actually because I have a license you know so. It could also be a person who, who has has been driving teacher before something like that it's just I don't have a car, so it would have to be their car. Right, so that that might be the that might be an obstacle I don't know if people are wanting to do that. depends, I mean Maybe I should just try and. Ask around or like. In our neighborhood list we have this neighborhood email this just see if somebody has has advice if somebody cuz people come up with good ideas there sometimes you know so. So that's that's what I need to do first and then see you know if. I just wish I do, I had a you know, like a trusted person in my life, who could just like sometimes you know, whatever happens to that or you know, but I don't have that kind of person, so I have to find somebody. Somebody else that can help me with it so. yeah it seems to me like a lot of times things don't come naturally to me, you know, like a lot of people would have somebody who would step in and say hey I could do this for you, you know."
226.0,Provider,"Some mindset, remember, we talked about that."
12244.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
226.0,Provider,"Remember that. It is a mindset. And yeah there are plenty of women. That you know aren't married or don't have a partner that are. able to you know so remember that. yeah like be be really aware of the narrative you're creating be really aware of what you're saying to yourself, because what you're doing by by that conversation by that sentence that you just strung together what you've done is just put up a roadblock. Okay, so things instead of saying to yourself things don't come naturally to me start saying things always work out for me."
12244.0,Patient,"yeah that's true yeah it's true, I mean it, I have, I have to see that, too, I mean that I even got that job that's really a miracle. Right now, and it's really amazing and I really love doing it that's not you know I really love the teaching it's it's been fun. Of course, it takes away a lot of time for my own artwork and that has been a little bit of a struggle and I feel like right now and. i'm teaching three days a week, which I think is too much, I have already decided that next term i'm going to go back to two days a week. But I wanted to try it out and they asked me to because they needed more classes and they didn't have another teacher and I was like okay well i'll just try it out, which we days and it's too much i've already come to that conclusion and that's okay. And yeah and then they like one thing that happened, yes, so they say they are now asking us to use the in 95 minutes instead of just the regular class and the class mass I haven't been using here people mostly use the surgical masks. But, but now it is considered that are not protective enough anymore, and that. At least at the museum, they have now decided to ask everybody students included to use a 95 mass not the kids the kids it's kind of. The kink the end that's that's that's the whole point it's hard to get them and it's the same for me, because my face is too small for the big ones it's like. it's it's literally like they go from like the very. You know my chin up to and they would they would pop my classes up like. This which doesn't work, because the progressive. yeah and then I don't see what I need to see, I have the wrong, you know the rock like the bottom of my classes, is actually for clothes, you know so so. And I mean, I have to you know it's not like, I have to teach in them, that means i'm sitting on a potter's wheel and i'm bending down, and you know. And I told them, I told the to the head person I can't do this I can't use the regular ones, they have to be smaller for me and. Of course they don't have them and I don't have them and she's like well, you have to figure out i've literally got that email an hour and half hour before I was leaving and it's like well and I. needed to have it right, then, right now, and I mean I can go and Amazon now and look around, and I mean i'm. At one point is like, I have to use the mess that I have I just i'm you know i'm not willing to keep spending money on that stupid pandemic over and over and then you know first I bought a ton of these. Of these fabric masks and then all of a sudden, nobody wanted to have those anymore, and I also realize that they're not really. very comfortable and I bought. I bought. A huge package like 100 of the of the surgical masks right, and you know, and now I have a ton of those left, and I also got surgical mask other places, and I have tons of surgical mask and now all of a sudden. I need to buy a 95 mess and find the ones that fit me and actually I yesterday I had one in my in my bag, because a while ago, a woman gave me one just to try it out and that's the kids one. And uh but for some bizarre reason it says m 95 instead of in 95 on it, so I have no idea what that means, and then she saw that and she's like well that's not the right one and it's like I don't know, I have no idea to even realize it said m 95 and. she's like well that must be a mock up, and I mean it's just I yeah. You know. And are these these these things, I mean sometimes it really like I have had like these conversations with myself sometimes when I bike I do this or when I swim you know it's like it's almost like the writing is on the wall that I need. To. That I need to do from here, you know. But then I had a conversation with somebody actually the same person who also helped me this this this woman who runs the. The artsy apartment in the museum also is the person who actually helped me find the place i'm living now. Because i've known this woman for quite a while, and she is really nice and she actually. We had this very, very short conversation about my housemate and you know how I always had complaining that she doesn't do stuff and that she that she isn't very. Community oriented that you know she's she doesn't pitch in and she's she is she's yeah she's not doing her part. I there was some some various very short part in a conversation with Susan with this woman from the museum, where I I said something about that and she's like yeah I know. She is like that she does not pitch in and it's very, very hard to get her to do anything that's what she said, and I said Okay, so this is not my it's not just me see seeing her that way, this is this is. The way it is and then she USA and then, but then the good like you know that the wrong conclusion i'm taking from this is like Okay, this is something that I really can't because i'm feeling I I a lot of times just feel like i'm being exploited, I feel you know I can't help it. it's just that way, I feel like i'm being exploited. But, but then Susan was also say to me well, but at the but on the other hand, she's also a nice person and it's pretty easy to get along with her, which is very to you know. So it's like well yeah and I just kind of I just need to I just need to see that part more in her right and just focus. On that part. and not so much on the effect that but I mean it's you know, like if you find stuff like you know she. Like it's just on a daily basis, where it's like you know if I if I go in, if I go in the kitchen and I take things out of the dish wreck you know the dish rag writer sink. I take everything she will only take her things out and reef mind in there, I put her which stuff on top of it, you know, like things like that that's what I mean like there is just no. No sense of community, there is just no she is her and she does her thing and, if I have something that I want I can do most like she she's not like she she doesn't. She doesn't restrict me or say no, no, no that's not her, but she what she does like she just only it's all about her or you know if something needs to be done, she won't ever take initiative. To get it done or to do it or she she will just. Wait until I do it, or if it's about gardening or something. I have to. You know, I have to I mean it takes it takes so much effort to get her to help me that it's easy I just do it by myself, you know."
226.0,Provider,"So you know the reality, too, is that living with people can be really difficult."
12244.0,Patient,yeah and everyone says that and that's true and it's probably just.
226.0,Provider,"That where it's just, and so I think what's happening is a lot of this is you're Personalizing a lot of it."
12244.0,Patient,And yeah.
226.0,Provider,it's really not. it's not directed at you.
12244.0,Patient,"know, and I know that I know that, but I think it's because because I am a person who tends to be. Who tends. To be a little bit. I get probably that's how I feel that I get. explore X. taken advantage of a lot, because I guess i'm just very. You know i'm very attentive to things and I do them and then it happens, a lot at others just feel like Oh yes, already you know I don't need to you know. I don't think. So I think I think I think it's a little bit off of my history and she and she has figured that out pretty quickly and she's taking like 100% advantage of it there's other people only do it sometimes you know."
226.0,Provider,Have a conversation or about.
12244.0,Patient,"Oh yeah. Many it and it leads to absolutely nothing. She will just say, but I do and she's extremely stuck on to and that's actually funny that Susan was also saying that. She will just she will just say that she always said that she does it. All the time and. You know. She will just it's just not like it's it's not helping much the conversations with her one time I got really mad I just I just. kind of lost it at one point when she I think us about taking the trash out and she cheated stuff you know, had all these excuses why she came came take the trash that's even little things like that that she just won't do you know. And, and you know, and I think I don't know what happened, I just suddenly lost it, it was just this pop and is like yelling at her and I actually think it was a good thing. I mean it was it was funny that happened to me and I apologize about it later, and I said sorry Marie, but I just I just can't take it anymore right now. it's just it's just so ridiculous, you know and and I think, but I think it kind of made her maybe it made her aware, a little bit, you know how how she comes across to people sometimes so. yeah I think it definitely made her yeah she she she she was pretty. She was pretty How should I say just very astonished that."
226.0,Provider,This person.
12244.0,Patient,"So. That yeah no. No, I think it's just that I think to just come back to the main thing that I just be like oh my God I think it's just some. Some you know some of those conversations that i've had in my head with myself like well it's almost like the writing's on the wall that I need a change, you know it's almost like it's it's almost like I really need to. To figure something else out and the funny the other funny thing, as I was doing this, I mean the one thing that has always kept me in the Bay area is that it's so beautiful here. You know it's like. yeah nature and the land around and the ocean and all of those things so stunning. You know, even if. I mean if I had a car, it would, it would be even more study, because I would probably really go on little trips up and down the coast and. stuff right, but even without a car, even the things I can do just by bike or are we taking bark somewhere and then bike it's an amazing. But you know but, but like I had this I did this hike on the second of January with a friend of mine at lunch and in salmon Cisco that's kind of like it's a it's a walk you might have heard of the cliff house it's kind of a famous famous location it's like. At the very end of the peninsula at the ocean and overlooks the ocean it's on these cliffs and and we were walking this this trail from from one of presidio park into along the cliffs to that cliff house it's like. it's really super beautiful. There, and I mean i've done this many times, but not anytime recently. and And she was just I mean she's also a person who actually grew up near the bay area so she's actually. You know, and she, of course, knew that trail and all but she also hadn't done it in years, and she was just so like oh my God, this is exactly why they feel this is exactly why I can never leave from here and that's exactly the right rhetoric, I would have had. Just a year or two years ago. And now, as thinking yes. I love this it's super awesome but actually I don't know if it's if it's if it can keep me anymore, because i've actually I actually feel like. The stuff that tells me not that's that's been difficult is overwhelming. The does amazing positive things of the bay area. You know. So I like that was interesting to me because because years ago I would I would that would have been like oh my God, I can never leave you know. never ever ever. And now it's like yeah I love this but. I don't. know you know I can't I don't I still don't think I can I can be here so. yeah that was interesting but. And that's actually you know."
226.0,Provider,"that's actually. Progress, if you will. yeah because you're you're now opening yourself up to different possibilities and. that's a lot of like growth, and you know, making a move. From a place that you live for a while and like really love it's a process to get used to the idea of possibly leaving or actually leaving and how does that happen like, how do you make that happen like what's The next step right so we've talked about how it might take another year."
12244.0,Patient,"It might think, at least, that the audio is not. Going yeah. yeah going to happen in that fashion, I mean sometimes I sometimes I wish something something would just you know pop up that like that I that you know that that i'd certainly know where to go for a reason you know. Where that I. You know, go to residency and just decide, I want to stay in that area, or something like that, but that's. that's never happened to me that way you know, like, I feel like I that's why I have this crazy idea about this travel this travel ads project, where I would be visiting all these different places and. and talk to artists and. And just really find the ideal spot right so."
226.0,Provider,yeah.
12244.0,Patient,"yeah and I don't know. I kind of think my life has always been the way that I have had to make. Pretty pretty hard and decisive decisions myself things have never just like falling in place, like, for some people, you know they they they fall in love with somebody and then. And then maybe they marry and then they just follow that person to wherever that person is libby and then they just things just fall in place for them at that place that's not been my story, I mean. Even coming here to the United States, you know I mean it was it was a very, very big and long and. and expensive and crazy and process to immigrate here, you know so and, and that was something, however, where I knew that I wanted to do that, you know. We I knew I wanted to come to the United States, and I wanted to live here and I needed to make it work, somehow, but it was very, very hard to do, I mean you know. it's not easy to become an immigrant and it's it's I mean I could tell you a long story about that was crazy was so crazy years you know, but I did it and I That was something I knew, though I knew I wanted to do that. And, and I knew I needed to make it work but it's not like you know, like most of my other friends who are immigrants from other countries, especially from Europe, you know they all come because of a. Especially Women because of her husband, they all have you know they all came because they got married to an American person. and It came in that way, like almost everybody, you know that I know like oh my if I asked of you know how. How did you end up in the in the Bay area, you know they they like, they will just say oh my husband Oh, I met my husband during this in this trip when I came in, you know, whatever it's always a husband, it was it was something. Like so I don't ask that question anymore actually because because it's just a name like Oh, you have no idea how. Easy you've had it, you know so. But yeah but that's it seems to me a little bit like i've always had to. To decide and to make decisions myself and sometimes pretty pretty harsh decisions to be even one according to go to a level, you know, like it's never been like oh let's just do that that opportunities coming up right now, you know so."
226.0,Provider,"yeah but again it's a mindset. You know it's. it's really about, you know. You know it's about how you view yourself and how you view your life, instead of looking at it as difficult, you can look at it, as."
12244.0,Patient,opportunity yeah yeah.
226.0,Provider,Look at it as but.
12244.0,Patient,"yeah I mean, yes, and that is sometimes sometimes people say this to me, you know you, you have you have achieved so much you have. done this all on your own, and you know and then i'm like interesting you're seeing it that way that's actually true and I never I never really appreciated those things that I have. managed to do. myself. You know so. yeah. yeah and then also with the I think I told you about all that heat situation in the studio where i'm. Working in I will let us and. And somehow other people are just not really speaking APP apparently and. The one of the board members attacked me likely to be attacked me a few days ago, and like he was kind of angry and he said, do you realize you. You are writing this to the board, we have the people who hired her and and you know. And, and you are the only one who is complaining and adults don't seem to why are you speaking up for others, you wrote in your email that others are saying this in this in this too and. And as like yeah, that is true, that is, that those are actually really quotes comments that I, you know that I got from other people you've already Vida de not complaining if if I. i'm in the studio it was this older guy who comes to the studio a lot but, but he is he's always just there for a couple maybe an hour at the most, one and a half and then he leaves and. Nobody has said anything to me and it's like well have you asked, did you ask them if they are cold no I didn't but I thought they would just tell me like I actually probably not you know so. He was like really, really angry and I had to actually say to him. Larry I am happy to talk to you about this, but I don't think you know you need to raise your voice, and I think we could just talk about it in a normal voice. And he did come down a little bit, and then I was talking to him for a little bit and he even said, if you if you want to, we could we could maybe we could talk about it again I have to leave now, but I was actually. Thinking about trying to. To call what to have a phone conversation I would first ask with the other board members, the Director of the Board, which is a woman, that I feel. Much better to talk to them, then then dairy larry's a super I actually have known him for a long time was fairly long time and I always felt like he. is a pretty nice person, but he attacked me in a way, I mean he stopped that you know he after we talked a little bit about it, he he lowered his voice and the conversation became more of a normal conversation. And I actually feel like the way I stood up was pretty good I did say he said. But it's not Okay, that you are, you are trying to speak up for other people all the time they need to speak up for themselves and and I said to him, you know very I actually have no problem speaking up for other people I think that's actually okay to do. You know and and and I don't know I feel like the responses, I had to him, I was pretty pretty my my mind was very level, and I was kind of you know. I was kind of. Defending myself in a good way where where he where he that I hope made him think a little bit too and actually at least Lotus. Is anger against me so. So there was a good thing, I felt, and I mean that he the fact that he was so angry I think that's really party because they realize that. A few of the things that I wrote are probably quite two and they didn't know how to deal with them, and you know I think it's that's what I think you know that that there is part of it that's. That because apparently they had a board meeting up I don't know if my lettuce cost the board meeting or if they were having the board meeting about this topic anyways I don't know that but, but apparently was discussed. So yeah and there is supposed to be another email coming out from the director there, she is addressing the heat situation I don't I mean I don't know it's I feel like she's just you know she's like. Like another two weeks have passed now since the since the break that they had where the where the studio is closed, and nobody knows what's going on and there's still that big big big neon pink sign at the heater say, do not turn on the heat, you know. I mean, in my opinion, doctors, taking advantage of one the epidemic, hoping that people think that he can't be on for some reason, because of the pandemic and to the fact that there are so many new members and they're hoping they don't know any better they don't. know that you should be there is heat, you know. yeah I think they are Duchess taking advantage of those two things, and they probably realized last year when we were when everything was locked down that you know utility costs went way down. And now they're like well why don't we just stop eating, then we can save some utility costs, you know. But I feel like they're also comparing apples and oranges, because, last year we they will also firing way less kills. And that is what really. Is what really makes up most of the utility costs. yeah but anyways I mean. And then I did get it, and then he doesn't that guy Larry told me then that. Bobby the director herself and the mate the director of the Board will be responding to me, and then I got really scared. For the invaders like. What if that response just says that I that they want me to leave for the day suggest that I leave the studio or something like that right. So as kind of a little bit like. I kind of tried to tell myself well if that's really happening, then that's really like maybe giving me even more of a offer you know. Like Okay, I need to figure out something else. But the letter actually then came and they do so do one sentence letter that said, thank you for your for your email. As as we told you, before we are addressing the situation and that will be an email going out later this week that will will have more details about the heat situation something like that that's that's all I got. and yeah so so I don't know what's going to happen now it's it's a little warm all right now, so that it's not quite as cold and. But, but still I mean all in all, I have the feeling that the way they are running the studio now, and that is the direction it's going just means that it's not. A permanent situation for me anymore it's. it's also something that I realized that. Is is temporary, and this is just at this point, I guess, just kind of an easy fix you know. They are at some point need to. figure out something else, and maybe some results so. The way it's it's a left the studio and he used to really love it but it's just going in a direction where I have to say that it's probably not it's not that great anymore. Just because, just because of everything the way they. They run it now."
226.0,Provider,What are your options.
12244.0,Patient,yeah see that's that's the question what am I options the options. The options in the Bay area.
226.0,Provider,No.
12244.0,Patient,"I don't actually see any other options in the Bay area right now. There is just no no place like that. that's that's that's within within. Within within the reach that I have with my bike. So. So that just awesome you know i'm like well, maybe I should just try and learn as much as I can, there you know, like get as much out of it and then and then hopefully leave and go somewhere some other place for me to do that anyways and hopefully. You know, maybe join join us a studio they or I mean Ideally I would be able to set up my own studio but that's that's. that's The thing that you know I don't know that that would be totally I mean that would be my dream, you know go to a place somewhere else, and have a have a. Have a little house at a studio attached to it, where I could have my own hi fi overkill but that's really, really hard to do because most most communities will not allow you anymore, to have these in the garden usually they outsource you know because. Because of all kinds of restrictions i'm MIT smaller communities where you can still do that. But. A lot of places won't allow you to do that anymore so so so who knows you know I mean who knows and."
226.0,Provider,"So what are some things. That you can focus on like right now like, what do you think like the the top. Like, what do you think it's the driving or. yeah like like if we like we like kind of. prioritize some of this. That was one of your short term goals, was to learn how to drive a car."
12244.0,Patient,yeah I think that is one of the things that I should really do that I should really focus on. That needs to be needs to be done first.
226.0,Provider,"So it was positive thinking you know. Like gratitude for what you have. And then try to learn how to drive a car, so I think that those are two really I think those are good places to start, I know that you, I know that you feel overwhelmed with things that you have to. have to get done."
12244.0,Patient,"I know that yeah I also yesterday I also. received like i'm on like because of low income i'm on medical, which is the California version of its kind of the medicare for people who are not you know. Well, because of whatever other reasons income or whatever it is like people, not all people, you know. old people it's medicare, but we have medical to and Yesterday I received this whole big package in the mail that I have to. To we as we apply or it's not reapply it's just like every so often, you have to do this and and as like oh my God and it got me very worried, too, because now, I have more income so. And one of the questions was you know the tax return from last year and i'm like oh my God I don't have that and I didn't even do 2020 years and. So that is something I need to address pretty pretty soon now and I don't know if they will be. Okay, with the one from 2020 I have no idea because 2021 is actually not to yet so I don't know if they can ask me for that one but they might. They also asked for page steps and all kinds of stuff like oh my God, this is really this can be really bad and you know, in terms of. them taking it away from me i'm very worried about that, because now, I have a little bit more income but, but at the same time I you know if I have to pay my own house and she. Just as well not have my unit, you know, then it's just that would be really crazy I just hope that that, as I still fall in that bracket where I am eligible for for medical."
226.0,Provider,"yeah, we need to find out what the bracket is."
12244.0,Patient,"yeah I don't know what the practice, so I have to do some research on the bracket and find out and like it, but it made me aware that I really have to do my Texas now and. I mean, maybe, maybe it's enough that I give. them page steps and things like that, but then. Maybe I should do it sooner, because the page steps from December weren't I didn't get as much money, I think it December so. And then they want, and then they say is your income, you know, does it does it fluctuate four months, two months in mind fluctuates a lot, because there are months when I teach in months when I don't and. So, so I have to kind of come up with a nearly estimate or something I mean I Maybe I should just. go from there, and not even worry about the tech about adding the tax return or do the. tax return and add that, and then on top of that, like I don't think it's going to be hard for them to figure out, you know and sometimes i've noticed with anything that has to do with social security related things it's sometimes really, really not. Like to decisions that are being made are sometimes very erratic. Like it seems to be depending a little bit, who is who your caseworker is you know. Like how they interpret whatever information you give me especially a gift you give them. Especially with people like me who have like parses self employment and who have all these these different income sources, I think sometimes they don't know how to deal with that and they don't know how to calculate it, and then they they. They just look at it and and it's kind of like like one person just comes up with, I think, yes, and I think, no, you know it's that's. that's what happened to me with food stamps yeah."
226.0,Provider,yeah. So you've got some things you need to get done.
12244.0,Patient,"yeah I know, and I really don't feel like I have time for it, but it needs to be done, somehow I just need to make the time for it."
226.0,Provider,"yeah because the taxes are going to be really dependent on your insurance Okay, so your insurance is really dependent, I mean that's you know that's important. yeah so maybe looking at it in a different way."
12244.0,Patient,"yeah I mean I it's just it's just I mean, I know I have to do those at least 2020 I just have to do it now, I just have to to you know I mean like my schedule is really tight, you know, like this, like. Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday is when I work in the city and it's really an all day thing yeah i'm here now and then basically after our conversation I have to do a little go swimming or. there's a few few office related things that I need to do this morning and then at the end I either go on around the world, I do yoga by go swimming. And then I go straight to the city, so that is, that is, the Wednesday, and today I even wanted to go to a museum show that closes on Saturday. run that's really kind of important, so I wanted to do that before I go to the museum, because today Mike I only have the late class, but I also need to do a lot of. what's called lab work, work, you know, like preparing clay and all those things and there's like a time that I need to do have that today that's why I. The Wednesday the day in between, I only have one class, but I have to do all that other stuff. And, and then tomorrow i'm teaching again and, like it's really you know, and then, and then I usually have. Friday Saturday Sunday and Monday to do my own work at the studio so might my my my time schedule is is tight and then like sometimes i'm you know, like this Saturday I was supposed to go and get clay, with a friend of mine either. it's a smaller smaller town north of Berkeley where we are, there are two different stores for ceramics and clay and we need to go and get it and. And, and I also was so now, if I can teach Saturday morning for the German school subbing for somebody and i'm like. I really kind of don't want to do that, but on the other hand, I kind of feel like Maybe I should help them out because. They have been helping me out with with face to, and I really liked the person who runs the program and who knows, maybe at some time at some point I want to teach There again, or something I. You know, sometimes I feel like well it's almost a little bit of an obligation, if they asked me to suck for somebody so you know, like my schedule is really, really tight it's and I think."
226.0,Provider,You can you can you know not go swimming you cannot do yoga one day I really like. yeah you can problem solve this.
12244.0,Patient,"You know yeah yeah. it's probably more that I just need to stay away from the studio for a couple three days in a row and. just say okay. I need to do those taxes and just sit down and do this and and and just not go to the studio. And of course I will be feeling bad because i'm paying. This August membership fee and i'm already not using it a lot, these days, because of the cold you."
226.0,Provider,"know how bad, will you feel if you know to your taxes and, yes, so you've got to wait it out."
12244.0,Patient,"Yes, I know."
226.0,Provider,way it out.
12244.0,Patient,yeah.
226.0,Provider,"So you might not get three days in the studio but you get your taxes done, and now you can still get your insurance."
12244.0,Patient,"Right yeah I don't know if the insurance yeah it's probably depending on yeah I should probably put in that 2020 we put that might help. Even though it's very different from what's now because 2020 us, but here when I did digitally nothing. Because of the pandemic right. So I don't know if it even helps maybe I just have to give them pay steps from now, and an estimate of how much I will be earning this year it's just I don't know so."
226.0,Provider,You know it's a guesstimate.
12244.0,Patient,"And I know I guess yeah yeah I understand that you just do the best that you can you know assessing your income. yeah I know I know it's it's kind of like like when I got that package so this like. really did I also need to get that now, you know."
226.0,Provider,"But think about like if your taxes had been done getting that package wouldn't have been a big deal. Oh yeah i've got this, then I can just. I can just send i'm good."
12244.0,Patient,"yeah yeah, even though I mean they are asking for texts report for last year, which last year is last year is 2021 and that's actually not even do yet, so I would probably not have those then."
226.0,Provider,anyways but.
12244.0,Patient,"You know the 2020 I should have those those should be done, you know so. yeah yeah it's it's. it's definitely something I just need to I just need to do it it's just because. I also I also finally ordered a new computer, I think I told you that mine was really old and that's that it's been an obstacle, with so many things. And it it it the way time it's like from when I ordered it it's about eight or nine weeks. wow yeah, so I think they are probably back lot, not just because of Christmas, but because it's a new computer model and there's also some kind of supply issues all all over the world, this. place she's from China and. You know, all these processes and what i've always said there's probably so, so I will be getting that somewhere around mid February. Which means. There will be a lot of stuff to be figured out then too, and I will have to hire somebody. help me. help me with that. So I should probably get the Texas, and before that, so that i'm at least you know, at least at least that's done. And that point. And I don't have to also do that at the same time. Because the computer it won't it won't just be there will be stuff that I need to figure out for that. yeah it's like. it's it's a it's it's it's a ton of stuff yeah."
226.0,Provider,"Okay. So you know again just making a commitment to find. A couple of days to get all that done, you know. yeah talking about this for a couple of weeks so. Well, that can also be like a really short term immediate goal that you set for yourself. Yes, boxes done."
12244.0,Patient,yeah yeah yeah.
226.0,Provider,"Okay, and and then we are, we have an appointment in two weeks on the."
12244.0,Patient,mm hmm that's correct yes.
226.0,Provider,"Okay. Okay, so taxes classes."
12244.0,Patient,yeah.
226.0,Provider,yeah I think.
12244.0,Patient,"i'm really good at at just not doing the things that I, you know that I. That are difficult I don't know how to do and I really don't know how to do these taxes, because of some income from Germany and it's those taxes out, I mean, I have to also hire somebody, but I have to prepare it first right. it's it's. it's those taxes are really something that matches your regular Texas. yeah so yeah and I think I just have this tendency if I don't if I if i'm afraid of something I don't know how to do it. I just I just keep pushing it away."
226.0,Provider,"But. The reality is, once you get to it and you just prepare it and. it's I know it's big. And not yeah yeah. yeah so it's just like chipping away at it."
12244.0,Patient,"Right right right and just like taking a whole. Day and just say okay. Nothing else today i'm just starting doing this and just and I used to be more able to do these things, you know where I would just like go for it and, just like. Do whatever it needed, so I don't know if i've had a hard time, with this being you know focused and just. doing what I need to do i'm just kind of like evading things are not not getting to them or or pulling out other stuff that I feel like it's more immediate and needs to be done right now, because, but those are usually easier things and. I don't know I I sometimes I wonder if it's if this is an ADHD issue I have definitely been wondering about that that i'm not able to to just sit down and focus anymore that was, but like I used to."
226.0,Provider,"Usually, that would have been present in your life from you know childhood, I think this is just feeling frustrated and overwhelmed. And I think that it's yeah it's when you don't know how to do something it's really easy to avoid it and nobody likes doing taxes, the horrible. And you know getting it repaired and then taking taking it to somebody is is going to be your best fat because. You know, you need to get them done and. Now. You don't have a choice."
12244.0,Patient,"yeah yeah I know, yes, yes. yeah yeah I just somehow sometimes feel like it's a little bit like also that story that when I think about I should you know I should I should. write to my sister and clarify a few things and I just never do it, or I want it for for actually at least two years now i've been wanting to contact my end again and write to her. And I just never do it, and like it, you know, sometimes it's almost like there are these things that I just don't want to go to and I don't do them. I don't know it's just it's a it's a little weird and then. But then I sit down, for hours and write and write about the heat problem because that's more pressing and it's actually more present in my immediate life than. The problems with my sister, which I know won't go away anyways, even if I write to her, you know it, I will just stir it all up again and I will have to deal with it again and. Again, maybe that's a different it's a whole different thing it's like yeah. yeah I don't know there's so many things that I just feel like I just don't get done and that didn't I always had a little bit of a hard time like. Even from childhood on it has always seemed to me that the day is too short, you know. Like i've always been a person who had a lot of stuff done to be done and who was very engaged in lots of different things, and I was kind of active but but more recently it's really come to the point where I feel like. i'm not getting it done like really don't you know, whereas before there was always like this almost not but then I do you know and now it's like I just miss. out deadlines that I really wanted to do. And in the past, it would be like oh my God it's that deadline, and then I would that I would get it done just in time, but I would get it done right and now it's now I don't, and that is kind of a thing that worries me or that makes me wonder, you know."
226.0,Provider,I think that you're creating. I think there's a lot of distractions that are you craving with. busy work and extra work and.
12244.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
226.0,Provider,"You know, maybe like. paying attention like being more mindful like okay what what's happening right now, you know, like, I want to get X y&z done but i'm sitting here and i'm not getting any evidence that we're going on why Why am I feeling like this. is happening by why I start asking yourself why. Trying to uncover what's what's going on."
12244.0,Patient,"yeah and it really is great sometimes that i'm sitting there and i'm not getting much done. And a lot of times it's actually because i'm too tired. And i'm just sitting at the computer and it's just i'm just not getting it done or it's this these things where you have to go to forums and you know, like last night I was working for at least an hour and a half at. It just signing up for a volume tears thing that I want to do so, I can. Go to to this conference, the ceramics Conference in March and I decided to Oriente so then it's free to go. And sign up the signup thing was a sign up genius and. It was it took me forever to sign up because of all kinds of first I had to figure out which shifts work for me and once I had figured that out. It was the sign up genius website and, of course, you had to make a password and then it said I already had a password with them, which I didn't like and then you get into this into this rabbit hole you know."
226.0,Provider,"Okay. Alright, so do you like the best time to just you know be mindful about what's going on. yeah and then we'll meet on Wednesday, the 26 at 9am okay. Alright alright have a good week."
12244.0,Patient,"Yes, you too, thank you. Thank you bye."
