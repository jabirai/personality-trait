383.0,Provider,"Okay. Okay, any problems else you'd like to say about that incident."
14631.0,Patient,"um. I think I feel like I personally feel like i'm still numb to the situation. But I think i'm feeling more of an emotion, because that is kind of coming around the corner."
383.0,Provider,mm hmm.
14631.0,Patient,"So I, and then I didn't I never had the opportunity to kind of have any type of a self care after that incident happened, and then I had a really bad breakup with my ex. January um. He broke into my apartment in February. And he left a box of bullets in my apartment. With a note so. That was kind of I don't know what kind of how do we take that message um. I was with him for two and a half years, so I still have. Unresolved emotions. um. And then on that was like January, February and then my mom being diagnosed to June. And then due to stress, I have hair loss. So she's everything's been just like a every time I feel like I need to come up for air like I haven't had a chance, I feel like I haven't had a chance to breathe."
383.0,Provider,"Okay, thank you for describing that your bad breakup was January 2021."
14631.0,Patient,yeah I called a couple of the quits this year yeah.
383.0,Provider,"Okay, and. When you like in your apartment where you in the apartment. Okay, and the bullets that he left them a note was that related to harming you."
14631.0,Patient,"know it was just like. he's actually a federal officer. i'm. I don't know, like the the note the note on the inside and outside is pretty much like instructions on how to use a gun, but I already know how to use it, so I just I was just really confused at the fact that, like I didn't even know how to take that message. I don't know what 500 bullets with instructions on how to use a gun, or if I needed assistance, you know, to get training for gun where to go like i'm fully aware, I own one myself. So I went through the whole training, I know how to use my weapon, I mean i'm just confused at the fact that, like what that message is or what that message is what's supposed to be."
383.0,Provider,For you did you reach out and ask him or anything.
14631.0,Patient,"I did um and obviously that didn't go well, but the relationship that I had with him was really toxic, he was like a narcissist and a gas lighter and a manipulator. And then every time I, so the conversation that went left about. about the me trying to get reasoning as to like how he got into my apartment. And how you know I expressed to him, I could go to the COPs, but I just felt like it's just on me to go to the COPs because I didn't want to have that much power to ruin somebody's career. So I kind of I, so I took the route of not going, but you know it's a. it's a uneasy feeling when somebody that's a part of law enforcement tells you that even if you go to the COPs that they're not going to do anything to him."
383.0,Provider,So there's not going to be any repercussion for his.
14631.0,Patient,So you know it's a little discouraging. mm hmm um. That conversation really didn't go too well.
383.0,Provider,"um are you worried that he could come in to your apartment again, or is it something that you feel is over and."
14631.0,Patient,"I think it's over because I mean We broke up in what I call it quits via email that's how bad a relationship got. In end of January, but two weeks after he took his ex girlfriend to Mexico. So you know, in my mind i'm thinking to myself, like we've been trying to work things out for the past, you know eight to eight months to a year. I was very vocal about like hey are you seeing anybody else and he would tell me that no and then for me to break up and for him to go on an international trip, you know with his ex girlfriend was kind of a shocker. For me that's kind of. I was another traumatic experience. So I think i'm not really having. a hard time. Like letting go even though a part of it is let go it's like. I still have a hard time."
383.0,Provider,mm hmm.
14631.0,Patient,"cuz I feel like I invested two and a half years of my life, and I feel like those are like my prime years. So. yeah it's it's been tough."
383.0,Provider,"Okay, thank you for explaining that. Do you have any anger problems yourself any difficulty managing your own anger."
14631.0,Patient,"I don't have a bigger issues like that, but i'm noticing that i'm. I have to be i'd be more cautious of. Rather than holding things is. being more vocal about like. issues and problems that I have."
383.0,Provider,mm hmm.
14631.0,Patient,Rather than internalizing.
383.0,Provider,mm hmm.

The motivation, or like the desire that I used to have. that used to be like my happy place. Depression. To be honest with. i'm having a hard time like. i'm really having a hard time with my emotions. it's like hard for me to I need a state where i'm having a really difficult time, like. describing how i'm feeling."
383.0,Provider,yeah I think you're doing a great job describing how you're feeling.
14631.0,Patient,Thank you.
383.0,Provider,Do you do cry often.
14631.0,Patient,It was extremely difficult for me when my mom got diagnosed so from June to August. yeah June to August was horrendous it was just like any little feet. But as of lately I fit. Holding my holding it is more than I should be releasing.
383.0,Provider,"Okay. I imagine that there's you know there's just a lot of things kind of dovetailing like you said together, you know your mom's diagnosis this breakup and then sort of started with you lost your job."
14631.0,Patient,yeah I get. I get it's nonstop. i'm just exhausted.
383.0,Provider,"yeah and then there's Kobe there's additional stress or that. And then the situation and Columbia. which I imagine that took when that happened like your entire trip. became an unhappy event, you know. yeah."

14631.0,Patient,"um I was raised Catholic I definitely believe in God, but I don't believe in the. The cover do go into a church type of thing OK, so my belief is there. But I don't feel the need to go into. A physical place with other people to. Define. Okay, my beliefs."
383.0,Provider,And what gives you joy and pleasure in your life.
14631.0,Patient,"I can't I can't I don't have that right now. And i'm having a really hard time. I have you having i'm struggling really bad it's like trying to get my happiness that. it's like everything that used to make me happy like. I don't feel the world or the desire. Like at all. So i've just been added to. It a really difficult space, and I feel like if i'm around people like I have to pretend, like the old be to be around them. So I tried to kind of avoid being around people for the most part, if I have to, if I can."
383.0,Provider,"Okay. well. Okay. And what are your main worries or fears. um what are your what are some important dreams or hopes, do you or do you feel like you know right now."
14631.0,Patient,I feel like my purpose is like to help others. Because it. Because that's the type of feeling that I will add up all the things that I do and when I help other people it's fulfilling for me. And I feel like. I feel like i'm supposed to. that's kind of like how I feel.
383.0,Provider,Okay well that's great um what are your goals for therapy.

383.0,Provider,Do you ever journal are.
14631.0,Patient,"I started, but one thing about me that i'm noticing more and more is that i've really inconsistent when it comes to have you do do things for myself, but i'm extremely consistent when it comes to helping others."
383.0,Provider,"Well that's good self, awareness, now that you're in therapy you're going to be kind of given some assignments. And maybe, since you know Okay, I have therapy this week I, this is something i'm working on for my therapy that will maybe give you some more impetus to do do some things for yourself."
14631.0,Patient,yeah hopefully that's what I that's the end goal for me.
383.0,Provider,"yeah good um so you know one thing that I think sometimes we kind of turn a corner in life and. and things are different and we have to find the meaning in this sort of new chapter of your life so it's kind of like you know you had this chapter in this relationship and that ended, you had a chapter, where you had a certain job on did. It was punctuated by this very traumatic event of the loss of this individual's life that you are waiting to, and so, and before that everything was kind of maybe going along you know you were doing exercise you're doing the things you'd like to do. And and and now everything to a page has turned. yeah I think that. If you've got a journal. A specific journal, for your therapy and maybe start thinking about and brainstorming and you don't have to write sentences, you can just put words or bullet points. Okay, and thinking about. The meaning of this time. you're taking care of your mom and that's very significant vision. You know that you're doing, and it seems like you care about your family."
14631.0,Patient,"That your family, so they."
383.0,Provider,Were parents are really important to you.
14631.0,Patient,"So i've really had i'm really i've been really hesitated. i'm trying to look for a full time job because my main concern is making sure that. My mom is okay. So, and then the you know the caregiving situation is not going to. hold you know me having to support myself that's why I took on this waitressing position. So that it can you know at least assist a lot more than. Because you're only limited a couple you know, the amount of hours that they give you."
383.0,Provider,Right right.
14631.0,Patient,So yeah.
383.0,Provider,"yeah so um. I think that brainstorming and journaling about. what's meaningful for you at this juncture, as you're seeing it. You know there's a lot there's different things that are being asked of you now, you know and taking care of your mom is. You know it's different than going to a corporate job and having a boyfriend you know. that's that was not very nice to you, it seems like he was if you said that you know who's gaslighting you and."
14631.0,Patient,"yeah so it was it's been up. The one thing that i've noticed that a I had a really difficult time with was that, when my mom was diagnosed like. I didn't have anyone to come up to like. To be able to like express myself like both my sisters are married. So, like they have somebody they have that support system outside of the family that they could you know, seek to kind of like. be open, you know when cheer somebody or like at least you know just in the back of their mind like no way that they go home to somebody but for me like when I came home like it was just me and I just had to sit with my emotion it's been overwhelming. And a part of be like. Well, you know. Like I always had that thought like you know. Like Maybe I should call my ex or maybe I should let them know what's going on just knowing that it's not a good idea which I did it, you know act upon it, but. Those are thoughts that were kind of like in my head, because I just felt like. I wanted some kind of a support."
383.0,Provider,Right right.
14631.0,Patient,"And because i've been with somebody for two and a half years is you know I managed to help him go through the process of when he was losing his on it. So for him to he was a really been person. So, like. So, like even having to like. Like I didn't have that i've just felt like. I was cheating. You know to be able to be there be the support system for somebody in a time of need for myself like I can't even tell him what's going on."
383.0,Provider,Like.
14631.0,Patient,"That was a really, really rough time for me."
383.0,Provider,"well. Sometimes you know the way we're looking at something also if we shift our perspective. That that can help. I know that it seems like other people have their spouses a support and sometimes their spouse is supportive, but other times people don't, even though they have a spouse that they can't really share, you know, a traumatic event with that individual in the same kind of way so. And they would be thinking wow it's nice to get to go home and don't have the weight even have the responsibility of carrying another relationship. So there's different ways to look at it and sometimes the way that we're looking at it is causing us pain, because what we're seeing is we're seeing the lack. You know right and and I understand that, I mean I understand I took care of my own father, for many years before he passed away and I, and I was by myself doing it and. And I see other people who are married with kids than their parent gets ill and then they're stuck between all of these responsibilities. Right and they are experiencing other stressors related to all these people needing them, you know their kid and their husband in there, so sometimes a good taking a good look and therapy at how are you looking at the problem and if there's a way you can kind of. shift that perspective, a little bit might feel about it."
14631.0,Patient,"Then. And then me trying to like get my confidence back and then I have like this the hair loss due to stress so like I can't even put my hair down like it's just it's just been non stop, I just want to just like breathe like. Like i'm not understanding why, like all of this, like all these tremendous not just like you know this isn't like a bad day situation is bad, but traumatic experience, one after the other, after the other, like I i'm so lost for words that's why it's happening to you."
383.0,Provider,"yeah sometimes you know. it's more useful to just think about how can I get through this chapter what's kind of what what is health and well being look like, as a person that's caring for their mom. Right, you know living on your own that you know what is health and well being look like, for you now. And I think it's good you're out of this relationship, because it sounds."
14631.0,Patient,Like a good for you. yeah not all. subtle.
383.0,Provider,So if you can add one thing. It sounds like you've got a good friend that's kind of coaxing you to get out.
14631.0,Patient,uh huh.
383.0,Provider,"And I think that an exercise and when you're out and about you know, maybe on your bicycle I saw you live in culver city, do you go down to the beach today or biking. Sometimes okay."
14631.0,Patient,I ride either to downtown I go by the beach.
383.0,Provider,At the.
14631.0,Patient,Marina that is Redondo Manhattan beach. Okay yeah.
383.0,Provider,"yeah i'm familiar with that area used to live in Santa Monica I don't live there anymore, but I, you know. And when you're out and about really just see if you can be be in the moment and just take in fresh air and the pleasantness of being in you know riding your bike the physical activity breathing just you know window shopping. That break that that is from your duties, the heavy duty so of being a caregiver because those are going to be emotionally. kind of draining so when you're not doing caregiving you're kind of doing self care of. You know, maybe getting home and. Putting a relaxation tape on or putting some nice music on that you like. And filling your apartment with like. You know soothing. Whatever you know, whatever you find soothing I mean some people that put plants around other people, you might want to find something like art pieces just just to see with you on. And just maybe start considering this as a new chapter to kind of create a new. You know it's a it's a different time. So. Those are just some thoughts and we can talk more about it in future appointments. yeah How does that sound."
14631.0,Patient,That sounds pretty good.
383.0,Provider,"Okay. yeah so consider your home your apartment like your sanctuary and. Okay, think about you know, maybe you want to just have you got a. little bit of. extra money or can get just maybe one or two things for yourself, you know mark the space is like your new, this is a new chapter, this is your home is now your sanctuary you go out this stressful world, but when you come home, you have your you know your place for you can be at peace."
14631.0,Patient,Okay.
383.0,Provider,So let's go ahead and. schedule your next appointment. Our Mondays that day when you could meet.
14631.0,Patient,Up yeah.
