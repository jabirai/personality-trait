324.0,Provider,A couple days.
16184.0,Patient,"yeah I did start taking a zero cool um i'm taking it three times a day, right now, but I was wondering if because i'm tolerating the Sierra club, I could take maybe 100 milligrams in the morning 100 milligrams at noon and then 200 milligrams at night."
324.0,Provider,100 in the morning.
16184.0,Patient,yeah.
324.0,Provider,100 at new. You say no.
16184.0,Patient,yeah known and 200 and I wrote myself notes this time so don't forget anything.
324.0,Provider,"Okay. Okay, just making sure we're not we're not. Okay how's your anxiety."
16184.0,Patient,"it's. Not as intense as it usually is, but I am still shaky most of the day. When it comes on when the panic attacks come on. It makes it a little bit harder. Just because I feel completely I feel kind of paralyzed but um. But I noticed a little bit of a difference with the seroquel I don't know if it would be possible to because that's another note I put increase the the milligram out like I think it's point five, right now, maybe Point seven five. Once a day."
324.0,Provider,increase which one are the escalator increase.
16184.0,Patient,The problem from Point five milligrams 2.75 I think I don't know.
324.0,Provider,Okay um. How are you having a panic attack Sunday.
16184.0,Patient,"i'm not i'm still having anywhere from three to five big ones, a day."
324.0,Provider,"Anything in particular brilliance on. Because last. Sometimes, because."
16184.0,Patient,"doll and sometimes it's just I wake up like today, I woke up and i'm very, very, very jittery and my heart's racing."
324.0,Provider,"Okay, you said free to fire panic attacks, a day."
16184.0,Patient,yeah yes.
324.0,Provider,"But nothing, in particular, are you leaving your room it'll."
16184.0,Patient,"i've actually left my room more than i've with my room once a day, sometimes it's just out into the hallway i'm kind of. dipping my toes in you know doing as much as I feel comfortable with and then coming back into the safety, I did manage to go downstairs once, which I know it sounds ridiculous, but it was it was kind of huge."
324.0,Provider,When you went downstairs to choose start to panic.
16184.0,Patient,"yeah a lot of it is because. Of the there's clutter down there. And when my environment isn't like disarray, and I get it's almost like. Clean clean house clean mind, I guess, so if there's things that are laying around or things that haven't been put back into a place with things that don't have a place on. It It makes me very nervous because I I don't know where to start and that's why in group, and she was talking about. prioritizing and stuff I know that that's something that I struggle with because it's kind of all or nothing with me. And so i'm trying to take little steps. Which is the reason why i've been trying to go outside of my room at least once a day, even if it's two feet outside of my rooms just getting past that doorway."
324.0,Provider,Is.
16184.0,Patient,"And I think. I think it's also a little bit bad because it's the holidays and they're also having artillery on base right now, which. I don't do well at fourth of July I dont I i've actually hit the deck before when i've heard a car back fire. bang noises are hard so having that constantly in the background, has been a little unnerving to."
324.0,Provider,Have a nightmare.
16184.0,Patient,"And i'm waking up, often in the middle of the night when I do sleep and I don't know if it's. I get a feeling sometimes that i'm in my body, but not in my body like a feeling of disorientation almost like when you go to a friend's House and you wake up and you expect to be in your bed, but you're somewhere else. i'm getting I get that kind of feeling, but I don't remember anything traumatic. And I that I wrote three things the seroquel the Opera Islam and then change sweet MED to lunesta, or so I only know about lunesta and ambien. or something to help my ability to fall and stay asleep."
324.0,Provider,"Okay, what let's go back to the Indian Have you ever tried the extended release and you."
16184.0,Patient,"know I haven't. No, I didn't even know they made an extended release I thought I thought extended Release would be kind of natural if you're taking it personally."
324.0,Provider,not actually have an extended. And I just want. To. yeah it's too early for me to try to send another one and it's only been a week. How are we doing with the full box of me. Are you still having.
16184.0,Patient,"I don't know if it's because my house is just freezing now because the temperature changed or maybe because my anxieties kind of come down a little bit. But i'm not having like I feel a little nauseous this morning, but I think that's because I haven't slept. So I, I think that it's. I don't feel that. Like down in the ditch depression, like my body doesn't feel depressed frustrated because the anxiety won't go away and anxious definitely but i'm not. haven't had a suicidal ideation. And I have i'm. i'm not feeling completely hopeless."
324.0,Provider,So that's actually an improvement.
16184.0,Patient,"Yes, yes it's definitely an improvement. The only difference i've noticed in my body and I don't know I don't know if it's a side effect anything i'm taking i've been constipated for a few days. But I can handle that."
324.0,Provider,They. still working. And he said you.
16184.0,Patient,know he. Because I was coming out he broke his toe like his third day at work. So.
324.0,Provider,Oh. OK reason I was asking I was going to see if there's any correlation between the anxiety and him leaving. To go to work.
16184.0,Patient,"Now, although I do tend to PR separate on the idea of my kids leaving the House like leaving home the whole it's not really like empty nest it's not like separation anxiety it's more like. it's I think it ties in with my OCD a little bit. When I was at the ranch and I couldn't call anywhere and I couldn't go out and I couldn't I just had to focus on, you know the Bible and groups that I was going to. I had a really vivid bad nightmare, and it just included all kinds of weird stuff like my younger son came out as trans and. i'm very i've always told my kids hearts not parts. So there they've never been raised to think anything's inherently bad or that any persons inherently bad. But. I think that that dream kind of represented my fears of my kids going out in the world, because I know all the bad things that can happen out there and knowing that they struggle with similar issues to me. It. it's something that. I want them to be able to have their own lives, but i'm terrified that something will get in their way, and they may not be successful. If I guess that's the best way to put it. So I it's more like a long term fear I guess or long term anxiety because I do tend to put the cart before the horse, a lot."
324.0,Provider,I know. You mentioned more inviting when you have to speak with your husband.
16184.0,Patient,"Yes, um. Recently, he tried to contact me. My son's kind of filtering everything through his phone right now, because I still don't have my phone back. But. He he texted my son, I think it was on the first and so that he wanted to talk to me and I feel like i'm the next time I do talk to him i'm just going to come straight out. and pray that he won't call CPS or think that i'm a horrible personal horrible mom. I mean, he should know we were married for we've been married for 20 years and i've taken care of everything, so he should know that everything comes before me, my kids everything. But I think I need to get past that fear and just kind of be straight up and honest with him and let him know that i'm not doing very well, but i'm on the right path. Like like when I had my meeting with Karen I told I told her that I had scheduled a whole month of back to back every week because I wanted the support of you, and I wanted to support the group. And I. can have their be kind of separate from that and. So. I forget what the goal, I have my goal written down, but we did make a goal. and The group the topic of the group was actually really great because it's got me to thinking about you know how, how do I prioritize things that's a difficulty I have putting things in order of importance. Tell me something that's why I think I get so hung up on it."
324.0,Provider,"Tell me, something I know you mentioned before, one of the big. Obstacles obstacles that you're having as far as even going out of your room is kind of centered around was going on downstairs you mentioned like clutter do you think is an option to. Even get like housekeeping or someone there that could maybe queen down there for you."
16184.0,Patient,"it's it's. A lot of stuff that can't be taken care of because we my whole lower half of my house flooded. Last year, like right before lockdown and pandemic stuff and. I ended up having to do most of the DEMO myself like to get all this stuff that was wet and everything out of the House and. It looks really, really bad down there then there's packed cases and trunks everywhere, because i'm my husband and I when we finally do go through with the divorce. we're going to be selling the House. And, and I had fought for a while, with the insurance to try to replace everything and just finally like reached my limit I couldn't fight with them anymore so there's a lot of damage downstairs but. We purchased our House in. For $499,000. And he was looking at the prices that most of the houses in our neighborhood are going for and I guess it's around seven 725,000. So apparently we bought at the right time and if we sell now, it will be the right time, so I have to figure out how to get my whole house packed up and together and. To find another place, I hate how searching I hate apartment seeking every place i've ever stayed it's always been long term."
324.0,Provider,"i'll just thought i'd ask if that was even an option to. begin, like the process of trying to maybe get things straightened out down there so that you."
16184.0,Patient,"had thought about that too, and then I was like if I hired somebody to come in, if I I don't have the money to, but if I if I had enough money to hire somebody to come in, I would be freaking out the whole time because I couldn't see what they were packing what they were throwing away. It sounds like an episode of borders, but I swear my house is in order, like it's just met it's not complete, you know with the floors torn up and. All the cabinets, we lost one of the the countertops it fell down underneath the Granite. So there's no countertop and like a big bear space and i've tried to put a rug over it. But it's really stressful because the House is way bigger than I can take care of myself. it's the biggest place we've ever lived in. And it has stairs so it's hard, because I have arthritis in my lower back and a lot of physical mobility issues so. going up and down the stairs is physically daunting but to go down and go guess I did the thing and then go oh gosh because the kitchen sink doesn't work that was part of the damages our kitchen sink doesn't work. So there's all these dishes that are in the sink, and in order to do them, I have to get my son to bring them upstairs so I can do them in the. bathtub upstairs. But it's it's definitely harder for me to be downstairs than it is to be upstairs and then it's even harder to be outside because. I didn't even mean to find out about the new strain of coronavirus i've intentionally avoided the news but. I ended up on autoplay on YouTube I think they played the some news clip and it was the day that the first person in America tested positive for the ominous. For the. oma chrome yeah on the chrome variant and it was here in California. And I went okay now all of my German phobia stuff is coming to the surface again and it's of course it's spread even more States now and they're saying it's more very, very violent and transmittable than. Delta, or even the original and they said that some of the people that are getting it had all their vaccines and boosters and some of the people that are getting it already had previous natural exposure, which is what I had I had I had at the very beginning of the pandemic so it's. I don't do well with germs I don't do well with not being able to clean when I clean I have routines that I have to do so things being in disarray is really hard."
324.0,Provider,Okay. And some of the anxiety that i'm listening to is related to the OCD symptoms to.
16184.0,Patient,"yeah, in fact, a lot of times my panic attacks are kind of triggered in that way. I think they're also triggered by ptsd like when they are till when they artillery drops. I just we had a thunderstorm and I was shaking and I couldn't I couldn't control myself. And I had to explain to my older son that I wasn't because i'm hand i'm really hands, if people make sudden movements I flinch but it's it's all what my I have a physiological reaction to certain things that I think are tied to ptsd but. I don't try to get into it too often because I don't feel it when I talk about it, but if I really focused on it, I probably would."
324.0,Provider,we're nowhere near are the Max for the full box of me.
16184.0,Patient,Okay. I wouldn't mind I wouldn't I wouldn't mind raising that too.
324.0,Provider,"But what I want to do is add on morning those. morning. In the morning let's leave the 100 at night. And again graduate and then we might have to go up even more on bedtime those. Max is 300 you're just at 100 so. I really want to target the like I say the anxiety, the panic and these OCD symptoms that you're having let's do 15 yeah we'd be in the morning, the tablets that you have now 100 100 milligram tablets."
16184.0,Patient,"yeah there's a big ones, the."
324.0,Provider,"yeah it's a one tablet Okay, so I will send in another prescription. well. You know what what you can."
16184.0,Patient,"And I can cut this in half, I do have a pill cutter I just couldn't cut the seroquel because it was so."
324.0,Provider,"Okay let's do that you're going to run out something happens in one anyway, but for right now. is still early is. For. let's do a half a tablet. in the morning and a whole at night."
16184.0,Patient,Okay.
324.0,Provider,"let's let's start that. Okay, the Sarah coil we are two. Okay right now we're doing 25 in the morning. And 75. and"
16184.0,Patient,"We boosted it up last week we boosted it up to 225 hours in the morning, one in the afternoon and then for in the at night time."
324.0,Provider,"that's why we're looking at it okay. i'm looking at the previous prescription here this on this frame, you know that because I didn't send any and because. At that time, you had 120 tablets. We can use these up and then I will send it another one. Okay. We have. 50 in the morning right now. And 100 at that time okay. Is that is that what your take what are you taking right now."
16184.0,Patient,i'm i'm taking. I think the 100 milligrams. tablets or capsules letting it go. pick one capsule by now daily at bedtime for Depression and anxiety. 100 yes 100 milligram.
324.0,Provider,"Okay. So this is 25 in the morning and we talked about. Okay, are you taking are you just doing morning and night, are you doing morning evening and my."
16184.0,Patient,brother seroquel i'm doing three times a day.
324.0,Provider,Okay. So you're doing 50 in the morning. In the afternoon and 100 at night.
16184.0,Patient,Yes.
324.0,Provider,Okay. So we can actually. 100 in the morning. We can do let's try 100 in the morning 5050 in the afternoon. And bump it up to 200 at that time.
16184.0,Patient,Okay.
324.0,Provider,"So total of 50 that way they'll help you sleep. And we're going to increase the full box of me we're going to add. 50 in the morning there. it's not a lot, I can do with this ambien because i've just been. Like I said they monitor these um."
16184.0,Patient,Is it would act are be different than the regular.
324.0,Provider,X. Are if i'm explaining it correctly. I want to say is described as like a two layer of one to get you to sleep and then another layer to help you stay asleep.
16184.0,Patient,Okay yeah.
324.0,Provider,"But it can just sit here. Honestly, probably will not. Report it. To the. State marketing programs are. So we'll do will increase the Sarah call at nine so we're going to do 100 in the morning will do 50 around afternoon. about the bit time does up to 200. Full box of me will keep the 100 at that time and do have a tablet 50 in the mornings now. gotta say what I really. liked about the full box, I mean and my choice on that one is because it's. FDA approved for. Like the OCD symptoms."
16184.0,Patient,"yeah it's like a twofer some of the medications are, I think I took lexapro once because I was supposed to help with both as well."
324.0,Provider,yeah.
16184.0,Patient,"at all, but is there. Is there any other medication for sleep that. Is not ambien kind of does what ambien does."
324.0,Provider,My list here and I see that you've tried Lester before.
16184.0,Patient,"yeah I. I took lunesta while I was pregnant as matter of fact. But it gave me a really weird metallic taste in the back of my mouth I didn't adversely react to it, it was just kind of like a tasted funny."
