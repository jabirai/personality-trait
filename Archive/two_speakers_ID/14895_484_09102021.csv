484.0,Provider,"Okay, great and so, can you tell them so you're here through the harm reduction model so want to start using taking buprenorphine buprenorphine products, we could talk about what one is fast."
14895.0,Patient,"Okay. Good oh no Oh well, what does this say so, so the reason i'm actually even doing this, as I told me, not a while back, we have a doctor out here and he's supposed to be a family provider he actually was providing a space for her to do her needle click needle exchange and step back anyway. All he cares about his pockets, so he switched and let a company by him out and. He promised me that nothing changed nothing will change and this and that he was supposed to be like my regular doctor so anyway, I I told him I had a problem with suboxone. That, for some reason it doesn't matter I can wait 36 hours 36 hours and it puts me in like the spiral down withdraw like. it's almost like I didn't wait enough time and I do I wait, the time."
484.0,Provider,you're in withdrawal when you should try it.
14895.0,Patient,"it's the know lock zone, I think, in that zone or Amazon or that yet so no locks on it. I think that i'm having an issue with but he's like Oh well, no, no can't do that and so i'm like okay we'll find that i'll just be dirty I don't care so, can I just come to the doctor and get my regular medicine, you know my imitrex my. lands and other Vegas know if you're not in the suboxone and program at you can't come here, well, I called my insurance and my insurance told me, oh no he's your assigned doctor. yeah give you everything else he told me that if he if I did not pick up the suboxone I could not be a piece of so I have like this much the boxes sitting at my house just wasted."
484.0,Provider,Okay.
14895.0,Patient,So that's my. that's my history.
484.0,Provider,"yeah yeah Okay, and so what are kind of some of your goals for participation in this program."
14895.0,Patient,"So I was hoping to get on the 70 tags. Because it doesn't have the knowledge zone i've never taken 70 text before. You even tried it. Okay um but I was hoping to get on that because I know people. I mean everybody's different everybody's different everybody's everything is different, I understand that, but I know people that have had a problem with suboxone like I have. And they have gotten somebody text and they've had no issue. Actually, clean now, and you know so so anyway that's something that I i'd like to do."
484.0,Provider,"And, can you tell me a little bit about your your history of substance use."
14895.0,Patient,Oh geez.
484.0,Provider,or a lot of.
14895.0,Patient,"It goes way back. Okay, so like. opiates has only been probably the last 20 no none in 20 years 15 years, maybe let's say. Since my dad got shot my guy got shot in 2008 2008 so so since opiates has been since 2008 before that was alcohol. And then, when my dad got killed that kind of just because we were drinking that night but anyway, it was long story short, but anyway, I just kind of moved away from the alcohol and I have pain like really bad in my back, I have a. digit denver's. Disease like yeah but. yeah, and so my my. Like right here in my neck my plates are there's no Christian no more warm and so they're like rubbing so anyway. I went to the doctor, and this is like I was like like I said it was like in 2008. And so they gave me they just prescribing just I don't know where I didn't even ask for nothing I just like tell them what happened, they prescribed me 90 oxy codeine and I are 30 and then they would give me. 10 hundred microgram fentanyl patches and those I would wear the patches and it would take the pills, it was I every six hours or some something like that some are on. It anyway, by the end of it, I was on 280 oxy ours and 1500 microgram fentanyl patches and then um what happened. Oh, my doctor went on vacation and was supposed to write a prescription and they forgot, and so I didn't know, obviously I had been on these things, all this time and I didn't know, I was swallowing them at this time and so anyway. He went on vacation they forgot to write me script so i'm like going down there and nervous and I, I feel I start doing sick, I mean nothing about that they don't tell you that when they give you that step know. And then i'm like oh my God well anyway, of course, you know I talked to people and they're like oh my God you're withdrawing and this. Can you take this and take that and take that so, then I go back to my doctor and you know IP in the Catholic I always do I come up dirty in the cut me off completely just. All of that amount to. straight off. yeah and so then then i'm like oh my God i'm still going through it. Obviously that's a lot of drugs, I had. And so, then i'm like okay well what am I going to do so for a while I went around and I just purchased the same things I had. on prescription I just. find other people that had them. And then they just didn't it wasn't working no more, I think that I was then I was trying to drowned other shit you know, like your mental stuff."
484.0,Provider,"So, are you needing kind of. higher doses."
14895.0,Patient,"Exactly exactly so and then then i'm like somebody somebody stupid mistake Oh well, if you shoot them up there faster it works better and it's like. yeah I don't know if I want to try that she just like grabbed my hand. She goes right. here's a vein put it in, and she did it for me, I like fell to my knees, I never had nobody do that for anyway that's where it started so. Anyway, and then, and then, of course, you know now because the opiate you know epidemic. kills you can't get any more or fentanyl patches or anything he's everybody's cut off of them. So then, it led to heroin and I don't, but I do not actually any know, and you know this, so I don't inject anymore. I smoke it yay."
484.0,Provider,"yeah so you're trying to reduce some of the risk there, I can see. I am yeah."
14895.0,Patient,"I was, I was I don't have any more veins, because how long i've been doing it. Okay, so what I was doing was muscling and. Okay, the needles that we get it needle exchange. And are not muscle needles I don't think there long enough. Okay, so what you're actually doing is skin popping. yeah and then you end up with a cookie policy, I mean my whole but has scars all over."
484.0,Provider,yeah bad infection tam.
14895.0,Patient,"Exactly, and so I would be you know doing this skin popping CIT you can antibiotics and go down i'm cutting holes in myself."
484.0,Provider,And I.
14895.0,Patient,"know the doctor. and draining my own shit and it's like just got it got disgusting. And so, for the last probably. yeah almost a year I haven't been I smoke it."
484.0,Provider,"Okay, and and how much have you been using recently."
14895.0,Patient,"depends on how long is my boyfriend around for really honestly I mean that's the truth so like if he stays here all eight hours i'll sneak in the bathroom like once or twice if he's gone all day long like that cell sit here today. Okay, but i'm a functioning addict I mean I know they they say there is not one but actually we own businesses and everything I put on the facade but."
484.0,Provider,"yeah. you've been able to maintain its kind of REACH other goals in your life, it sounds like."
14895.0,Patient,"yeah. Like. yeah exactly i'm not like that. that's I almost think that it's scarier being me than being somebody unfunded running on the street, because somebody i'm functioning on the street it's like they know they need to get it together me i'm hiding it from everybody."
484.0,Provider,And i'm going to. That but that's hard for you. Exactly yeah.
14895.0,Patient,"So it's like that's it's it's almost like you're like a thin line there you know it's like nobody knows, nobody knows everybody's got to be quiet and my son dope not my son told me, you know what I mean. Okay, is he went through the whole addiction process with me but it's like. You know now moms plane, but it's not that i'm clean it's just there's not needles flying all over the place they don't. He 16. Okay, so you know 10 files easy to just throw in the garbage you had before it was before it was needles like. Can I lose shit. yeah anyway, so I. went from the you from injecting to smoking and I just like to be normal honest."
484.0,Provider,But.
14895.0,Patient,I still have. pain obviously i'm gonna have to deal with yeah.
484.0,Provider,And we can talk about that a little bit too um do you ever have sort of been Jews were using a large amount more than you intend.
14895.0,Patient,"No honestly, no, because I, this is so, so. Anyway, I have enough money that I buy large quantity. And it sits I don't okay I don't over I just use it to get that's all. kind of I don't like it, I don't even think I can hide anymore I just it's it's so I can just do."
484.0,Provider,To get your.
14895.0,Patient,ball exactly that's all that's all that's all.
484.0,Provider,and Have you ever had any accidental overdoses before.
14895.0,Patient,"I did actually in jail, I mean i'm Not a bit not purchase smoking in the yard and that they took me to the hospital and. scary yeah it was actually for me it wasn't because I didn't even know what the hell's going on. yeah but for them, they freaked out in it kind of weird because now i'm bail bonds and I have to do that deal all the time, so they're like so now they're i'm also hiding it from that you know what I mean. yeah there I O D there, and now they think i'm like all normal and so what i'm still on. But we're not doing that kind of stuff no more that was. dumb shit when I was younger but yeah I did I did have an accident, then, and then there was another time when I took. I don't know what I did it was some kind of pills, and my my ex husband Sean he he had to he spring to the nasal ones that's right when you got the nasal. And he had used to have a Monday and then I remember, we were so pissed off because it was the last of my stuff and he made me sick so mad as so mad."
484.0,Provider,yeah. by reversing that yeah.
14895.0,Patient,Is that you have ticks all.
484.0,Provider,You have an hour can now.
14895.0,Patient,I do.
484.0,Provider,"You do Okay, because I bet your prescription a map."
14895.0,Patient,"To a Nina. I will take a prescription for it, if you can."
484.0,Provider,yeah I will.
14895.0,Patient,"Oh yeah yeah so. I know, but still yeah yeah yeah okay yeah. that's fine. I don't need it."
484.0,Provider,"you've done, have you been through like medical detox programs before or it sounds like you've been in in treatment at various times."
14895.0,Patient,"No never well, I mean i've been through that that stupid guy over there, that I told."
484.0,Provider,With suboxone trying to get on it.
14895.0,Patient,"But then they wanted me to go through this link counseling and they want me to do this, and they want me to do that, they want me to do that, and they want me to take suboxone then. i'm like if you're not going to give me something that i'm actually good so really what I was doing is i'm doing all these hoops to just get my normal lasix and meds. To the backup suboxone and i'm still getting high. They didn't want the suboxone but I had to have a way to get my normal meds because I. may retain water I have all these other health issues. Okay, so yeah I was just so i'm like oh Fuck it i'll just sorry anyway screw it i'll just get high and then i'll just. Take this suboxone loaded up in my closet so I can get my regular meds so. yeah yeah as a treatment, but I wasn't using it because I wasn't even using the suboxone."
484.0,Provider,"yeah I see, and so it sounds like if you can kind of separate your. treatment for opioid use disorder from just getting a regular health care that might be a better."
14895.0,Patient,solution Bagley.
484.0,Provider,"Okay, and so part of the just run the same page what would I would be prescribing for you is still buprenorphine if that's that's sort of the the goal of part of the goal is the harm reduction, and we would potentially start it at a very low dose initiation. Is your goal to sort of there's two ways to start buprenorphine one is that you wait and then you experience kind of moderate withdrawal symptoms you take it treats those withdrawal symptoms."
14895.0,Patient,Of.
484.0,Provider,"You know it's actually not in the lock zone that is causing the if you felt like people take it too early. The buprenorphine is actually stronger than heroin and will kick the heroin out of your brain and that's why people often can feel withdrawal if they take it, because the."
14895.0,Patient,buprenorphine we did.
484.0,Provider,"36 yeah I agree that that doesn't make a ton of sense to me so i'm when I yeah I don't know why, so I don't know that but, but just saying that if you if you get buprenorphine alone something like somebody check then. it's still buprenorphine."
14895.0,Patient,You know that's the many yeah.
484.0,Provider,There is a way to start it so Is your goal to sort of stop using are using just heroin or any fentanyl.
14895.0,Patient,Will i'm sure that all the heroin has spent.
484.0,Provider,"yeah. Do you have test strips I do, but they don't always come up it's true it's true they're not not foolproof yeah no. um."
14895.0,Patient,But so sometimes I know that there's fentanyl in it and i've tested it and it doesn't.
484.0,Provider,"come out of saying okay well, one of the protocols, we have for the harm reduction model is you take very, very low doses of buprenorphine to start. And then just kind of you'll not naturally decrease your use of heroin. Until they're almost like an overlap, but that prevents causing withdraw if you were to take more than."
14895.0,Patient,yeah yeah yeah yeah okay. Take more than I supposed to but I yeah I wouldn't do that.
484.0,Provider,Then you would put you off that's my only point yeah.
14895.0,Patient,"yeah yeah yeah. No, no. Obviously, if you tell me what to do and how to do it i'm going to do it yeah I just need you know."
484.0,Provider,understood um and. Any other. substance use currently like alcohol now or.
14895.0,Patient,"I don't do anything, no."
484.0,Provider,"No, not drinking alcohol currently okay. Like benzodiazepines or anything else it's going to impact your thinking. All right."
14895.0,Patient,awake zan zan zan zan.
484.0,Provider,"zan okay that's a benefit as PDF so that may sometimes that can, in combination with buprenorphine can meet."
14895.0,Patient,People who.
484.0,Provider,"made it a little bit lower dose. And you know if your goal, then, to stop completely using heroin and just stay on the buprenorphine long term."
14895.0,Patient,"and honestly no. No Okay, no I don't want to stay in it long term what's your whole desktop switching one for another, I just want nothing. To do nothing."
484.0,Provider,"yeah and I think if that's your goal, then I definitely respect that I will tell you from my experience you to give yourself some time and sort of see see if you're meeting your goals. There are, there are some people that will stand it for a long time, some people will taste take on it for however long until they feel like they can try coming down the dose typically kind of tapering the dose is that. yeah that's fine this thing okay Okay, but i'm what i'm hearing you say, somewhat, though, is you're not looking just to sort of get a prescription for right now, but are you interested entering the bright heart kind of longer term model as. Well, regularly."
14895.0,Patient,"yeah yeah yeah worse because I know that it's not it's not gonna be like one prescription and i'm dead, but I have to. write it's it's it's like a whole working yeah no I get that I totally get that. And that's."
484.0,Provider,"interested in being part of a part of that yeah. grandma okay. Oh yeah I want to make sure, because I think the way they all just let them know. so that they can."
14895.0,Patient,"She asking you, if you want the low barrier or, if you want to go along, if you want the whole full thing wait, are you out yeah are you asking me if I want low barrier I want like like. therapy and all that stuff."
484.0,Provider,"Are you also interested in therapy and things are no. No, no okay i'm just being clear okay."
14895.0,Patient,Okay.
484.0,Provider,"All right, but you are you but you're but you're interested in in you'd have to I can give you a one week prescription for now and then you'd come back and then for right now for starting. Okay yeah and you can either see me again next week or you know or somebody else who's who's who's here. Okay okay so couple more questions so you mentioned some medical problems. So what do you take the lasix for."
14895.0,Patient,"Okay, so I can water really bad and i've had my doctors actually still doing tests, but before it was my feet, that would retain water and then now it's my knees and they did a sonogram on my kidneys my. abdominal my liver my pain crit you name it, they did it and they can't find anything that's me."

Like after I got no I don't even think I started using because of that I, because I was on regular meds I think I started using because I. don't remember, I mean obviously you know, there was some point in my life when I was like Fuck my life I hate my life, and you know I just used that I had nothing but now it's like you know I own stuff I do stuff I had jobs that. i'm like so busy, and so functioning and so yeah no I don't think i'm depressed anymore."
484.0,Provider,Okay um any concerns about suicidal thoughts.
14895.0,Patient,Oh no no.
484.0,Provider,"Okay, any history of suicidal thoughts or or any suicide attempts or no. No okay. All right, we asked everyone those questions because it's."
14895.0,Patient,Obviously.
484.0,Provider,Important part of making sure everybody's safe. All right.
14895.0,Patient,funny looks swollen. risers for.
484.0,Provider,My first time meeting as I can tell. yeah.
14895.0,Patient,And the one swollen i'm slowing bad right okay.
484.0,Provider,"So just so i'm clear on sort of your plans and goals is that you do you one of the things we do for the kind of the the call harm reduction or the low threshold. Low barrier is, we can start at the low dose initiation which would not not involve you go waiting and going into withdrawal so that's one option. But we, but we also it sounds like that wasn't necessarily what you wanted to do you are all but I don't want to put words in your mouth, also an option is sort of a more traditional initiation where you. Wait until you feel withdrawal symptoms and then treat."
14895.0,Patient,"It doesn't matter to me if I if I don't have to feel it that'd be better, because every day."
484.0,Provider,So we can certainly try that.
14895.0,Patient,"Again there's something that I can I can be like Okay, I can lay around a bit, but yeah."
484.0,Provider,"Well, we can certainly try that so the instructions for are a little bit more complicated the way it works is that you kind of can continue to use the opioids that you're using. And then the buprenorphine dose is slowly increased and then you'll kind of notice a natural nationally that you just need you're using less heroin to feel Okay, because it's sort of replacing the spots in your brain for that."
14895.0,Patient,"Because what what I do is I wait until like and before I go in and do anything I wait until i'm like I start to feel like flush and sweaty. yeah and then, and then I start yawning that's when I know I know that it start, and then I go and I do my thing and then i'm oh better you know what I mean. yeah so I know when i'm when it's going out."
484.0,Provider,"got a system and, as I was saying before the reason we do these tiny doses is because, if we gave you if you were you had heroin in your system and we gave you. A higher dose of buprenorphine it's going to put you withdraw because that's what it does that's how it works, you know, because it does such a good job, binding to the receptors in your brain that it. kicks out there when you feel like you put you in which all from there yeah, so this is a super low dose that that I would order for you."
14895.0,Patient,Okay that's fine.
484.0,Provider,"And, and then you should not have withdrawal symptoms, if you do it might just be that you need a lower dose and definitely don't take more than i'm then i'm giving you."
14895.0,Patient,Each day that.
484.0,Provider,"Bad. Well, my only reason is."
14895.0,Patient,More and it was the worst idea in the world.
484.0,Provider,yeah i'm.
14895.0,Patient,Thinking more is not going to fix it.

14895.0,Patient,"And do I get to stay with the same like you, the whole time are they gonna throw me around."
484.0,Provider,"i'm not 100% sure if you're always on a Thursday, it would probably be me but i'm not, I want to, I want to clarify that for you, because I think some patients are use this program slightly differently, and then they may like transition into another another model, but I want to ask them."

484.0,Provider,"messaging them now. i'm asking them. And then, let me just look and say, make sure we have the pharmacy stuff because that's. Do you know which pharmacy you gave them."
