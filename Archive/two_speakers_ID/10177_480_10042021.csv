480.0,Provider,I like how you say weirdly white and gold.
10177.0,Patient,It was one of those ones where it was like I bought it back before I truly knew what I was doing i'm a complete and utter like. i'm an old lady when it comes to technology. But I spend all of my time on a computer. So I try really hard and it just doesn't work out very frequently.
480.0,Provider,I completely relate to that.
10177.0,Patient,it's like I don't know what any of this means he asked the guy this door and he looks at me like you're in your 20s you don't. Like I don't you know what's so funny is so many people I know in their.
480.0,Provider,"Early to mid 20s struggle with technology and they say the same thing they're like people just expect us to know, because of our. age, but like technology, I think."
10177.0,Patient,"Well, and also like a lot of it looks like I grew up pretty poor, so I wasn't like really integrated with the technology so there's like a couple things I could do like. You want to know how to get a second hand playstation one to work when they were putting out the playstation four I can help with that, but when. Not if it's not built into the ancients. here."
480.0,Provider,"So my kids have gotten really into sims this past month it's so fun because they're showing me everything you showed me that one day i'm like I know I know how this works already they're like, how do you know."
10177.0,Patient,Really fun and they've been putting up like a lot of fun. I haven't played it too much this. Like we mostly because i've been spending most of my time. Not cleaning and crafting only the pokemon or not.

480.0,Provider,"What do you mean you finish the game there's like an end game, I thought it was just something you always play."
10177.0,Patient,"So there's kind of so how it works is like i'm oh my God, this is so awful oh no well I got my camera to work but it's it's very rough. Okay, because it's like it's just a warning were like 4k hd and i'm in my pajamas looking like a little little gremlin child. China sure you don't look like a gremlin child Oh, I do I do we're. Full grambling child pajamas salon i'm hairs in like day three been."

10177.0,Patient,looks like there's. that's for sure.
480.0,Provider,Are you feeling better from Friday.
10177.0,Patient,"A little bit i've been really struggling with my health it's last week, I think it might have to do with. Just sustaining such high stress for so long."
480.0,Provider,yeah. Aaron on your body probably.
10177.0,Patient,"yeah this has been like literally one of the most stressful weeks away like for invoicing pretty decent amount of time. i'm having like stomach issues. i'm starving i've over eaten almost every single day this became like three cookies yesterday that was just for dessert and then. I have been like craving the food that makes my body feel gross so I you know feel like nasty because of it, so and then i've been really busy heart palpitations feeling faint hours fell over yesterday i'm. Not."
480.0,Provider,"You okay so completely, aside from all the stress Have you had like normal labs done recently to check iron and thyroid and all that, because all of those could be symptoms of that too."
10177.0,Patient,"yeah I haven't had them done, probably in a reasonable amount of time for like. For for. yeah probably haven't done has been done in a reasonable amount of time, however, the correlation between my stressor going up and the random over flux of it. it's pretty link and it's also something that's like it's super normal for me when I do get stressed to have like physical reactions, you know I also have."
480.0,Provider,Over like pre existing.
10177.0,Patient,heart condition and all of that sort of stuff so it doesn't take much for the stuff to happen anyways but just adds an extra level of stress to it.
480.0,Provider,rains great.
10177.0,Patient,Like minimize the amount of stress. i'm.
480.0,Provider,"fortunate about anxiety is it's like. anxiety and makes you have physical symptoms, which makes you more anxious, which exacerbates the physical symptoms so it's like a never ending loop."
10177.0,Patient,"it's like I was calling. About anxiety is like you can do everything completely and utterly correct like you know i've been making. You know, especially before it got to the worst part I was doing myself as much as I could, so you know, I was drinking my water, you know doing little movement taking time to do things that I enjoy starting homies like that sort of saw. It and play with it at some point things it just gets so much and it's like. The things that reduce anxiety become like anxious triggers. yeah so you can't get through it on my end, you know I have my liking, keeping it very well and account for help when I needed it and verbal verbal yada yada and i'm like the only way out is through but. it's just kind of a it sucks until it sets a little bit less but. This week."
480.0,Provider,"Has your suicidal ideation been increased at all, since all this extra stress."
10177.0,Patient,"Yes, my intrusive thoughts have been really bad."
480.0,Provider,What kind of intrusive thoughts.
10177.0,Patient,"So, because these models coming."
480.0,Provider,This is tomorrow right she's coming tomorrow.
10177.0,Patient,"yep because he's coming on mom. doing a lot of like cool. I have to keep a really long breaks and conclude with my brain out of nowhere else you like a normal like healthy amount of dirt and i'm like man there's probably like bugs in there he's probably like maggots in there and that sort of stuff. Which is the worst. And so all like build myself up where it's like if we keep cleaning we're going to put ourselves in danger, because if the dirt away from it that's better than the dirt and dirt very loosely it's dirt now but it just little little things, and so I keep having issues, make it longer and. fun and getting a lot like angrier and i've been to get it out on see a little bit meaner than I. don't consider myself as a person. A lot of the like, why does it matter thought it's gonna get dirty anyways like cleaning. Ray now life it doesn't why fix the problem because life will always be the problem so. The only real way to stop the problem is to not be living a life, but you don't finish. I don't understand why I have to do all this stuff for life, but I don't even truly want to live. Which is always my favorite one because you can't like logic your way out of that one I don't know why that one's logic into town so freaking sound, but. So."
480.0,Provider,"So then, how do um. Get back into believing that it is worth it."
10177.0,Patient,"I don't I don't believe life is worth living majority of the time. it's just how much can I push it away. How much can I, how much can I cope with the fact that it sucks. Sometimes it's much harder than others."
480.0,Provider,I came.
10177.0,Patient,Being alive it's not really a justifiable experience for me. it's like a tour just has to be done.
480.0,Provider,yeah. Do you feel like it's fronting right now.
10177.0,Patient,i'm not really sure Heikki think it could be could be feeling. A little bit. could be an a bit.
480.0,Provider,"coming together because, for me, I feel like Anne Marie. is the only one, so far i've experienced that doesn't believe that and Marie believes that life is worth living, even though it's filled with stuff."
10177.0,Patient,"yeah she's. got her right yeah she at least once in a while. yeah that's things like me wrong i'm not I like but. it's like everything's like a cost benefit analysis, you know. yeah majority of the time we're in the red. So."
480.0,Provider,"So with Z is mom coming tomorrow, what do you expect like is Anne Marie going to show up and put on a good show, do you expect. To continue to worsen with the stress symptoms, what do you think is going to happen."
10177.0,Patient,genuinely my hope is is that she decides to front lock herself so i'll have to deal with it until. We can fall apart afterwards.
480.0,Provider,"Okay, is that has that been the pattern in the past. yeah. kinda kind of."
10177.0,Patient,I mean there's a.
480.0,Provider,cost benefit to that too.
10177.0,Patient,"Oh yeah no. sucks for her but let's let's, I guess, for the rest of us, I don't really know how to word it. huh it's like a it's closer to like a safety thing you know so like because it sucks for her the host body or whatever can continue to. Very live. Right now."
480.0,Provider,and feel. And pseudo safe.
10177.0,Patient,yeah out of. debtors probably closer to what it is. None of us want to do something.
480.0,Provider,yeah. hmm. It where's mom sleeping when she's here.
10177.0,Patient,We have an extra bedroom. Right now it's just set up for my little sister because my mom is literal the worst and so we'll keep trying to kidnap her.
480.0,Provider,Have you been successful.
10177.0,Patient,I mean my molinar stay here ones for like two months and the beginning of coven.
480.0,Provider,So oh.
10177.0,Patient,"My yeah not recently, though, after that, because my little sister didn't want to go home afterwards and my mom like had called her and my little sister can answer and my mom called me. And was like you have to force her to pick up the phone and I said i'm not going to force you to pick up the phone I don't pick up the phone when you call I can't make her. Right, she was like look you're not her mom and i'm like, why are you trying to get me to Mother her about picking up the phone, you should have cards bad manners to nod and so now really is annoying. she's a mom."
480.0,Provider,What happened happening at their house is her husband back.
10177.0,Patient,"yeah he's talking to house they're not really talking and they're sitting in separate bedrooms as of now. Madison doesn't really know what's going on and been talking to her she's mostly been hanging out with like French until like we have like two high schools in town and so they have football games it's like a big game, or whatever. yeah that was like. She was. Trying to refine she's like so none of us know how. It was fine I guess. cool."
480.0,Provider,huh. So is there talk of them like separating or are they just going to kind of cohabitate and ignore the issue.
10177.0,Patient,"I mean that's what they've been doing for the past, however long they've been."
480.0,Provider,married.
10177.0,Patient,So I wouldn't. I wouldn't really. caught my mom's thing. Making it a big deal until it actually comes down to doing anything about it and then not so.
480.0,Provider,that's frustrating and that probably triggers a lot of stuff for you just seeing how this is all played out.
10177.0,Patient,"Well, and it's like, why are you going to bring me into your drama if you're not going to actually do anything about it."
480.0,Provider,Exactly it's just causing you to worry more. about your sister your mom yeah.
10177.0,Patient,"Like you're doing everything to let me know that she's in an unstable environment but wont to any of the things to help her be in a stable environment it's like so I don't know if you want really hold your hand but I whoa. And like after we have like one day, where it's like i'm not telling her how much of an abusive piece of shit she is then she's like. best friends, when you know, for we miss you know, like literally, not the last time I saw you the time before that I was like I hope I never see you again and she's like. I was then this is now you gave me a hug once at a birthday party, so I think we're all good."
480.0,Provider,"Yes, that's confusing."
10177.0,Patient,"Is she doesn't like to pretend, like the thing is like real, the problems are real and frickin and marine. She puts on such a good front, sometimes. And it's hard to tell when she's. Genuine or not, because she's doing it out of her perceived safety. Great means that then i'm almost like oh yes you're making progressions to have a healthy relationship with our daughter."
480.0,Provider,But what your mom fails to recognize is that if she's not doing any work to grow or change there's no progress being made.
10177.0,Patient,"yeah no not at all, and she can't see that, like Why would be a like Defense. and offensive response to not pissed her off more. Right like obviously it means we're homies now. Literally hate, you and I told you like, I told her that if she wanted to seriously be in my life, then she would need to do things like go to therapy and get the help and start making progress on doing that behavior for Madison. As i'm like you're it's too late for me already fucked me up."
480.0,Provider,Oh yeah.
10177.0,Patient,"i'm like there's nothing that can be done about that this is just my life now things call me but Madison is still like 14 she sounds a chance, she still doesn't immediately see every single thing in her life that's literally the worst ever."
480.0,Provider,mm hmm.
10177.0,Patient,So maybe we continue to or maybe for being like an awful lot like shit but.
480.0,Provider,"Then you've actually told her that, and how does she respond."
10177.0,Patient,He does does she basically just says like i'm sorry you remember it that way. Oh gosh.
480.0,Provider,Which is so gaslighting yeah it's like.
10177.0,Patient,"She is the personification of like. gaslight gaslight and guilt trip. yeah she's like I was a single mom trying to raise you I was at my best I wanted nothing more for you to have a happy life and now Madison suffering because you remember. The fact that I didn't feed you and that I literally like your room gets so messy that maggots grew in your closet and you reach in and grab them with your bare hands and. Other stuff and so and then she's like i'm sorry you remember it that way, like I don't know either way you can remember it but okay go off again. And wow something awful but. it's like a nightmare zone, and she doesn't realize it and she has a pair and she thinks i'm doing it to hurt her feelings. Because there's nothing more I enjoy out of lights and making my own personal life more complicated, just for the fun and blessing uppers I guess. So yeah that's my not part is definitely my favorite. happy. doesn't even affect me literally anyway yeah whatever she's also convinced, I have bipolar ISM and when I tell her it's not my colorism I can take that off the table, she tells me that she's not sure if i'm. So that's another really fun discussion that we get to have every time she talks me but. I think that's her way of trying to say like your way of remembering the past is it real. yeah you have mental illness and ppd is known for like. A closer to a warped sense of reality. yeah I think that once you keep trying to say but that's what I got. i'm like."
480.0,Provider,"Well, I can assure you, you don't have it."
10177.0,Patient,"And i'm like I don't have like any of the symptoms, for it."
480.0,Provider,or anything.
10177.0,Patient,like that.
480.0,Provider,Like oh.
10177.0,Patient,"it's not even close like we do have people family who have been diagnosed with that my, as I said, she's been diagnosed with it, but like. that's like the only only thing that's even close to like an indicator is that one family member has it and i'm like there's no reason to think that that's anywhere close to it but. Particularly here. So."
480.0,Provider,"Do you feel like you, are emotionally attaching to the anger."
10177.0,Patient,A most homie talking.
480.0,Provider,"yeah because, like when you talk about this, I definitely feel there's some anger towards your mom but are you even emotionally attached, or is it so far dissociated at this point."
10177.0,Patient,"So far, so she did a lot of the like angel that I like righteously feel a lot of it has to do with Madison. yeah because it's so stressful to tell him things like you know. This is the active like, so this is what happens with your parenting style you've got two children and therapy, neither of them can work because they are so mentally ill. And neither of them particularly derived joy out of life and then you're looking at this third one third time's a charm and you don't think that may be something should change. Right and so it's like. that's what a lot of the like anger still at this like. yeah it doesn't like a blind woman could see the repercussions that she has had on us and she's like i'll just keep doing it. she's like you're so angry puts your dad left and i'm like I don't even remember that now by would you say in an abusive relationship with this guy because I was sad I was like 11 years old. Right, even though i'm in. It wasn't even a love it, I was like younger than that i'm like stop using my past trauma to try to justify. You know, wanting to take the next step. know me and. If I don't even talk to the data anymore he's a vocal douche bag."
480.0,Provider,yeah like.
10177.0,Patient,I wanted to say with him either. BC he's one of the ones I feel bad for him he's a douche bag mostly because he went off to war he worked in the army had some pretty complex ptsd when he came back. But instead of getting help. He decided to take a job in a prison.
480.0,Provider,Oh.
10177.0,Patient,"And it's like he the prison, and he works at two it's the. Big one in New Jersey so it's like where they send the worst of the worst, which then like exasperated and symptoms being paranoid that stuff so it became an unbearable to be around because he was like 10 Minutes that every like. Guy that was looking our way was kind of like attack us in some way. And so. Every also just did not keep up with the times he's a little bit on the like republican side, but on the I don't believe that people who are different than me shut up all rights republican side."
480.0,Provider,oh dear.
10177.0,Patient,yeah so i'm like you dodged a bullet and so did I.
480.0,Provider,feel.
10177.0,Patient,And now you're going to make an. Excuses it's mostly what this. that's how it be I guess.
480.0,Provider,You have plans on like fully cutting contact with mom once madison's out of the House right.
10177.0,Patient,"pretty much yeah i'm not. My emotional attachment to her is incredibly small. If there is any at all majority of the feelings that I feel for her is. it's even less of like words that my best for my own personal experience vantage stand that like. Some people just aren't fit for a mom and they should have been a mom and she's she was too young when she became a long to truly understand what that entails I get it. So a lot of it just has to do now, with the treatment of medicine and that sort of stuff I have in my in our our view of her, we have abstained from the role about their head and what we think motherhood should look like. And we allow like grandma can be is, who I would see as a mother she saw I saw as a mother. And that sort of stuff. For."
480.0,Provider,"yourself, because you had to Mother yourself a lot."
10177.0,Patient,yeah absolutely and then things like mentors and that sort of stuff to allow the advice given to them to kind of like fill that role and the advice myself.
480.0,Provider,That makes sense.
10177.0,Patient,yeah actually projecting on youtubers who have their life together because of it by. That so lot better than the alternative but. Like everything about her screams she should not have been a mother like thinking about license to people before you had a kid she wouldn't make to animate the cloud so.
480.0,Provider,Would it be one that'd be fantastic if you did have to like apply for a license to be a mother.
10177.0,Patient,"yeah like I don't believe in policing women's rights and but also there's some severe benefits to getting a license before you have a kid yeah I think classes, or whatever."
480.0,Provider,"yeah cuz I mean honestly like there's no perfect way to parent. No. I get that everybody's human everyone makes mistakes, but like you're saying there are some people that just it would have been better if they were not parents."
10177.0,Patient,"yeah and what I mean I you know, I will say 100% it would have been better for her to if she wasn't apparent. yeah like. Her deciding to keep me um was just a real bummer for the both of. which it sounds a lot worse than I think it is."
480.0,Provider,"Right now, I get I get this sentiment behind that and."
10177.0,Patient,"yeah like. yeah so the Odyssey of it, she was literally like. I think she she gave birth to me like three or four months after her 18th birthday."
480.0,Provider,Oh wow.
10177.0,Patient,"And she had no home she had her mom was addicted to drugs her mom had her when she was 16 and my mom's dad was 32. wow my mom or my grandma sold my mom, to my great grandmother. To get cash to use drugs yeah so that way she would have a semi normal life and use a thinner teams she ended up raising her younger sister to to like it was just a whole thing like fucker like do I feel bad for her little bit do I still hate her yeah absolutely."
480.0,Provider,can go.
10177.0,Patient,"To say she had an easy life would be completely dismissive but to you sometimes a justification to hurt others is completely uncalled for. Yes, wow. wow yeah it's crazy like it's just a lot but yeah my. grandma would be another person who wouldn't have got the one in the past to test your mom she's literally 16. But my great grandma someone. Who, I thought the kind of. connection with so and she was there from majority of my life was good. She also did try to seek help for me when I was younger from my mental health my mom recently found a quiz that they have. my grandmother cake, like the questionnaire about me from what I was in you, because I find might have seizures because of my self harm tendencies. But neurologically I think that's fine. it's really funny the reading my grandma's name looks like she's absolutely enjoy angel except for those times and she'd grammar head into the wall and act like it didn't hurt her whatsoever and continually do that unless i'm not that she was like a pretty normal child."
480.0,Provider,"Other than that, little tidbit."
10177.0,Patient,"yeah it's so great, I was like her charm."
480.0,Provider,So you're not close at all with the grandma your mom's mom.
10177.0,Patient,"She passed away one of those little um. Okay, I think I was like two years old, or something like that my sister was like six months old."
480.0,Provider,was an overdose.
10177.0,Patient,"um it was. It was exacerbated by the fact that she was on drugs so she has a heart issue and. They couldn't give her the medicine, because it would have her it was one of those things where I think they gave for the month before they didn't come from the medicine, but it was a lose lose because she had the drug in her system."
480.0,Provider,yeah.
10177.0,Patient,"So it was one of those ones where like there was a higher chance because the drug was in the system of them not doing it or do I don't know, but she would survive, but she did."
480.0,Provider,yeah. So you didn't you don't have memories of her at all.
10177.0,Patient,"No, not really."
480.0,Provider,"And how do you feel like I mean obviously your mom's had a lot of trauma, but do you remember her being affected by her mom dying."
10177.0,Patient,"You know I don't remember my mom always says to me, is one of the lovely things I love is against me. is on the day that her mom died, they were in a fight so she didn't say goodbye or I love you or anything like that she just kind of thought about the House she died on Christmas Eve right. Little beautiful package so we were getting ready to go to like the church thing or whatever that they have you go to on Christmas Eve, the candlelight service. yeah and that's what i'm all about the call she she was mad at her mom was taking so long to show up. and got the call that she was in the hospital."
480.0,Provider,Oh wow. yeah.
10177.0,Patient,"And so, whenever like i'm like."
480.0,Provider,i'm not so your mom likes to use that to guilt trip you.
10177.0,Patient,"yeah she weaponized is it against me and it's like you know my biggest regret was that, even though my mom was mean to me that I never basically like forgave her or whatever and i'm like that's cool we're different people for a reason but that's cool. Sir or ma'am. yeah I don't know why she's just black it's white all the way around. And when I say crazy like she's literally crazy, but not in like the dismissive way or like the. sort of thing, where you know how some people they use crazy and it means just kind of like. it's not like that, like it's crazy she's got trauma like."
480.0,Provider,legit yeah.
10177.0,Patient,Like legitimate. and But she's not like what 40 something and. it's not getting anywhere close resolve she's just perpetuating the cycle of abuse and that sort of beautiful nonsense.
480.0,Provider,yeah well and that's where like we were talking about earlier once you've seen that the person is so against changing growing getting help for themselves and the only thing you can do at that point is boundaries and not let it affect your life because she's 40 something years old. and clearly not wanting to address not wanting to take responsibility or accountability not wanting to see the reality of things so there's no hope that you know in another five years she's going to get there.
10177.0,Patient,"No that's a lot of like medical issues and that sort of stuff and he's on a lot of medication medication, especially taking like the amount and that kind of stuff it tends to like exasperate your mental state so she's probably just going to keep going up and then. I just wish that she did the responsible thing and. Put place Madison and safe trusted please visit her as closer to a grandmother than a mother. yeah the point of clarity mental and physical health but."
480.0,Provider,you're pretty sure that would never happen.
10177.0,Patient,"No she wants the idea of being a mom more than the. yeah your mom. You know, like you, killing the like horror stories about like the like adoptive parents who return their child because they didn't bond that's like what my mom is except for instead of returning us she just keeps trying to force it. yeah that's what she does it doesn't it doesn't the benefit of the child doesn't matter, the concept of the mom."
480.0,Provider,"yeah that's her source of worth and validation even though she's not doing a good job, just the fact that she is a mom it's enough for her. Well, so, then when z's mom comes, is there any like grief that goes along with seeing like Oh, this is what a mom actually should be like."
10177.0,Patient,"it's like such a catch 22 you know cuz like supposedly 190 percent of our childhood we we refresh I don't have access, the majority of those. Things and so. Like walton just kind of like chilling out in the headspace and then his mom will say you know will be just a genuine nice kind of mom Reminiscing on the time they went to the pumpkin patch or whatever, and then randomly will kind of get that blurb of memory that of like. The monstrosity of which we went through and stuff like that yeah. And stuff like that it's not particularly like a jealousy type thing it's just more of it adds that extra level of stress because. it's going to continue to bring up memories that their way for a reason they don't need to come back."
480.0,Provider,Exactly it's the unpredictability of the triggers.
10177.0,Patient,"yeah absolutely and it happens, like. it's like over the stupidest stuff you know. we're making a joke, because he was her they were talking about how their mom would always buy them the like organic MAC and cheese, or whatever, and my scissors sandwich my mom and me both her and I looked at each other, like. Oh yeah that hurts, and that sort of stuff so just some random stuff it just triggers he's like. yeah and I also my response it's so unpredictable I don't know if it's going to be enough to. Like send me to a meltdown."
480.0,Provider,"Because you brought up your sister, how is she doing because she's been in therapy for a little while now right."
10177.0,Patient,"Yes, so this is the middle sister that i'm talking about oh."
480.0,Provider,"Yes, with me, she had been in therapy she sees."
10177.0,Patient,"Her therapist tomorrow, they have a little bit of a rocky start. To their relationship, and it seems like it's turning over like iron out now is one of those things where the therapist wanted to jump directly into like cognitive behavioral training and exposure therapy and that stuff my sister's like I haven't been a pack we haven't even."
480.0,Provider,read it yeah.
10177.0,Patient,And you get to do things because the therapist was giving them advice like maybe try applying for a job and I.
480.0,Provider,was like.
10177.0,Patient,"I think i'd rather stick nails in my eyeballs. yep and things like also we're very focused my sister's a little bit heavy all of us are a little bit on the. lovely chunkier side, but so because of it to be kept trying to do things like work on her relationship with her body and she's like my body isn't the issue it's my contamination like fear, because we grew up in absolute filth in squalor that's the issue like. yeah like one of the issues that they're having like recently is. There their brain will randomly tell them to do this and contaminated. Until they don't want to eat anything that's at home if they see something like a. stray hair or something like that, on their plate they can't eat what we eat, for the rest of the day, if that's what it means they and then, which leads to the morning, a lot of fast food. Because. It feels safer, because we don't get to see the process of how it's made."
480.0,Provider,yeah.
10177.0,Patient,And so that's one of the things that we both for with but she isn't a lot more Hers is a lot more food correlated.
480.0,Provider,So yours is more withdrawing shutting down Hers is more. Food eating disorder stuff.
10177.0,Patient,"yeah she also has some like behavioral issues like I do, but there are a lot less is it cool."
480.0,Provider,got it okay.
10177.0,Patient,yeah my know like louder.
480.0,Provider,yeah.
10177.0,Patient,"She could she could pass it like neurotypical in both situations, but most definitely is not. doesn't also particularly have a lot of like empathy."
480.0,Provider,Even.
10177.0,Patient,With just one of the things that she wants to work on.
480.0,Provider,"Well i'm glad she stuck with this therapist, even though it. was a rocky start."
10177.0,Patient,"yeah it was just one of those things where also you know she's a little bit fearful so to tell your therapist I don't like what we're doing it's like. yeah freaking typical as hell, and so it took a lot of nerve, for her to get up and be like I don't like this, so."
480.0,Provider,that's awesome.
10177.0,Patient,yeah.
480.0,Provider,"I love that. Okay, so before we wrap up a are you going to be at group Friday, because these mom will be here."
10177.0,Patient,"I should be yeah. Okay i'll send you a message, if not. Okay, I couldn't i'm unless there's like something planned I don't know oh also. Love her desperately she's not my kind of our adult I have no idea how many days she's saying here at the House I have nobody said she'll be gone I don't know what to do, I know she's taking my car and could be here for up to 15 days."
480.0,Provider,So that's nerve wracking.
10177.0,Patient,"yeah the lack of control, I have in my life is absolutely devastating. When we are not doing well with it, but so that's, the main reason why I wouldn't be able to go to it it's it's that she has something planned in her and kind of where I want to set something up that i'm not yet privy to. Because, for some reason i'm privy to none of it. No, no."
480.0,Provider,"Okay, so then My other question with her coming is Have you ever completely gone and non verbal with her here, and do you feel like that's where this is headed."
10177.0,Patient,"i'm incredibly nervous about that my thumb so I have had have been evolving throughout the years being on the patient and that sort of stuff so now a lot louder about them, I have a harder time masking absolutely exhausting Why would I want to do it for 15 days in my own House. Right, so I am very nervous about that sort of stuff and what it's going to mean."
480.0,Provider,yeah.
10177.0,Patient,Like long term and that sort of thing.
480.0,Provider,Long term as far as your relationship with Z two z's relationship with their mom like What do you mean when you say long term.
10177.0,Patient,"it's a very awkward situation to be in because I. Although she's never been mean to me, and they were close to it she's always been just a kindness and gentleness. I can definitely tell them not her favorite person she does she does a very good job of trying to cover it up and it's one of those things where it's definitely not in my head it's one of those things where, as most people they. know that he can do better than me. She herself was married to a disabled person beforehand and projects, a lot of their insecurities about how one side of the relationship was on dni because I can't handle the same physical load. That he can my body breaks down and keeps my days to recover that sort of stuff on top of all of the other illnesses that come along with being by beautiful shining so. My load carrying is. Different so she projects, a lot of the onto resentment that she grew in the relationship. On to the relationship that. We have."
480.0,Provider,yeah that makes sense.
10177.0,Patient,"So i've always kind of known. That i'm not her topic or the second or third but also she wouldn't. I think she realizes that her relationship with Z would become a lot more fragile. yeah if he decides to act on that with me. So it's a terrible place for me to be in because then it's got that idea of I want to prove to her that I am not lazy lazy about why i'm actively lazy lazy about. Ray as well. I don't want to create a friggin issue in their relationship with the last, and I want regulations like homie. yeah so last thing that I would want."
480.0,Provider,"yeah that's totally understandable, so that makes sense, as to why you would be afraid to shut down because it's just further proof to her that this is one sided, as she says, which is not true."
10177.0,Patient,"No, and also the like. Like because I spent the past week, like cleaning excessively. That sort of stuff like trying desperately to get my life in order, well, I have a. million other stressors that are pushing down the Pike university. Which is like being a freshman I applied to university, which was all great until I realized I don't have a speech comm class, because I was originally trying to apply to a different type of university that didn't require it, so I applied without the. Course Credit hoping that I will be able to take it either open summer or at San Francisco state, but I haven't heard back from them, yet as to whether i've got it or not, it's killing me Oscar haven't responded to me over a week. At this point, he was like can you do at the beginning, I was like nope news like hadn't said anything sense. And so, and so now i've been spending the last several days trying desperately well I feel like i'm about to pass out and for love and you cry every 25 minutes. trying to get the House look somewhat Nice and neat well, the fact that i'm praying paths to guinea pigs two rabbits in a bird and the House get clean. Right exactly."
480.0,Provider,And that sounds so exhausting.
10177.0,Patient,"It is i'm so tired, I just want to sleep forever. wouldn't be in that space. But a loss, here we are. yeah."
480.0,Provider,"Here we are, can you nap right now."
10177.0,Patient,When ra Th I might.
480.0,Provider,have my good.
10177.0,Patient,"crawl bed. it's just so tired so exhausting there's still so much to be done, but."
480.0,Provider,It doesn't actually need to be done.
10177.0,Patient,"I don't I don't know about that. Okay it's a little bit it's the oC there's definitely it's a little bit driven by a little bit of OCD tendencies, where it's like bad things will happen if I do not get this done. they're empty danger is immediate. So if I don't clean the little piece of wood that covers the sink in the bathroom some it's something bad is going to happen 100% i'm not sure what it is. But I know. In my soul. that'll be something bad. And so there's been a lot of that it's exasperated 100% usually."
480.0,Provider,yeah.
10177.0,Patient,I love it.
480.0,Provider,holy moly well.
10177.0,Patient,yeah.
480.0,Provider,I am feeling.
10177.0,Patient,"You right when i'm feeling the stress, I am like whoa. yeah. Well, normal person would be stressed out by this much and. I am. I am not qualified a level of stress of. very rude and I don't want it anymore Thank you have a great day."
480.0,Provider,"And I wish for your sake, like the stress would end when she got here, because for a lot of people it's like you stress before and then, once they're here it's like Okay, but I know you and how you operate and it's just going to. keep going and getting worse, so as much as possible rest as much as possible when you can get away with it because I think that's going to be your saving grace it's just try to rest try to sleep try to take care of yourself. And, of course, email me if anything comes up."
10177.0,Patient,We will go.
480.0,Provider,"yay. Well, have a good nap sleep for those of us who can't. hi."
