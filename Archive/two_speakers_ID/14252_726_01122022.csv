14252.0,Patient,hi sorry it's so dark here.
726.0,Provider,Oh that's okay. Are you in a car car.
14252.0,Patient,"yeah i'm in the car cuz i'm at a hotel but. uh well our trainings at a hotel, but it doesn't start it didn't start in for another hour and then I left my aunt's house, because she lives like 30 minutes away so I had to like be here, so that you know I would have I could do this appointment."
726.0,Provider,"Okay, well, I appreciate all of that effort that you put into being."
14252.0,Patient,"Oh yeah no problem, I thought it was yesterday I did this yesterday, but it was nice because I got to sleep i'm so. Tired I just. yeah."
726.0,Provider,"um how many how many been since the last time I saw you I felt bad because I felt like I wasn't very helpful in our last session and I was like Oh, I was just thinking like you know how it would be a guest today um you know talking about it, I guess."
14252.0,Patient,"um yeah I mean I feel like i've been pretty depressed it's like pretty low I feel pretty good right now, like right now, right now, but yeah pretty low definitely like. Definitely just depressed I guess but. I don't know I reached out to mariah a little bit and it's not like she's not really doing nothing crazy but she's not doing anything like I feel like she's supporting me in the best way that she can so that's Nice, I feel fine about that. I think I just feel like. i'm depressed so I don't know, I was thinking like dang like I really don't want to get medication, because I don't I just feel like it's so hard to monitor how i'm doing when i'm on medication, because as take the medication every day. But, as it stands now, it will have been. I don't even think it's a full month just from the 24. Pretty pretty severely down since then, and then before that already pretty like wanting to isolate myself, so I don't know i'm just trying to think what I want to do, I bought a bunch of vitamins. But yeah I don't know."
726.0,Provider,"i'm I know it sounds I and i'm not a doctor, but. vitamin D levels have you heard have you gotten those shirts."
14252.0,Patient,"Because yeah it's in my vitamin D was low, so I bought."
726.0,Provider,I bought.
14252.0,Patient,vitamin D. And I got my little multivitamin so I just have to try to you know take it everyday like medicine. yeah because when I first got my blood work done my vitamin D was little.
726.0,Provider,"And because I think a lot of people don't really most people don't really want to be on medication all the time, but if you feel like maybe for. temporarily for a period of time if that would be helpful for you, that maybe thinking about considering it and maybe making a plan around you know. Maybe if it's for a temporary time i'm just to get out of the fog, because I think sometimes when. When people are really depressed it's like you're in this fog and it's really hard to get out of it so once your automate things look a little bit more clear or there's not so many like conflicted feelings and thoughts. And so just something to think about I guess you know."
14252.0,Patient,"yeah I need to make an appointment I I tried to make an appointment with shontelle but they said, I have to like I had to log on to something to the clinic I can't do it just through email, I guess, so that's what kind of stopped me just because i'm I haven't had time to do that."
726.0,Provider,"um I have these links for the virtual clinic that I can put on the chat so you can have it saved for when you need to use it. I think it's easy because I think it's easier than actually physically calling them I don't know how you check in or anything like. That but. I think, doing the zoo doing that, through zoom sometimes a bit easier."
14252.0,Patient,Okay yeah I have the one for checking for checking ids. And then making a quick bit. I don't know if he told me to do the compliance one I can't remember which one i'm supposed to be doing.
726.0,Provider,"I think that I know I have. I have three different numbers, I have compliance care navigator and admissions so I just put that in here. copy. yeah so there's three different. rules, so you could go into and then."
14252.0,Patient,So what's the admissions for.
726.0,Provider,I think admissions is for people that wanna i'm sorry the program or.
14252.0,Patient,"Oh. Well yeah my phone's kitchen. Okay sorry yeah no I wouldn't say that last time you didn't help me I didn't feel like that, because I think, for me, because I haven't i'm not really like. I don't want to talk to anybody and things like that, so I don't know for me just having the opportunity to like talk and or cry whatever like no I didn't I appreciated it because. I feel like I should that's the kind of thing I should do with like a friend I just really don't want to so it's kind of like well in the meantime I guess it's good you know might as well just do it, but um yeah yeah so no I didn't feel like it was it didn't help me at all."
726.0,Provider,"I was. When I was thinking about you know how you've been feeling down and everything is like, are you feeling down when you're not busy or when you're occupied and you're working and you're doing things do you feel like your time is does it feel the same way."
14252.0,Patient,"yeah if i'm busy it's good it's when i'm not um but, even when I am busy like it's pretty hard to like stop. My like intrusive thoughts because, like even today, or even right now, like driving like I was trying to listen to music that I have to like say all the words, so I have to like really pay attention. um but even then like I can be like that are that are wrapping all that stuff but still like in the back of my head i'll still be thinking about um and it's typically like it's just kind of just frustrating because it's typically just. me not being close to angel or you know and then just kind of feeling like not knowing what to do about it and then kinda like I just it's the same conversations like i'm just talking to myself, like. Leave it alone and then i'm like well, maybe it's like this because i'm not communicating properly and then i'm like well, maybe it's like this because of that, and you know and. Should I say something I already did say something, maybe in her eyes were fine you know, so I feel like the the cause of me being so depressed a. yeah I think it's just like interpersonal relationships it'll be that it'll be a little bit of mariah feeling. feeling like i'll feel embarrassed or I feel down when I think about. um I don't know when I think about just things that happened in the past doesn't matter for fine now like I just think about things that happened in the past or the fact that she just went through all this stuff and we never really talked about it. And so it's just kind of like I feel like wow I don't know and then with my roommate the fact that I don't want to talk to her about anything. And I like i'm really hating her for no reason, just because I just don't I just want to avoid her, so I think. what's causing me to be depressed are those three oh and then so it's those three things and then also just feeling down because i'm not close to. Certain family members, like i'm staying at my cousins or i'm saying my aunt uncle and it's like you know we're not close and i'm not close with their kids and I just feel bad cuz they're my cousins and I wish we were close but I try to tell myself like you know it's not my fault. we're just people living in different states, and when we lived in the St when we live closer together, then yeah we would spend time together but. That was when I was a kid and now I grew up and I have you know my own life and they do too and it's it's not like i'm missing calls from them. They don't call me I don't call them it's like it's out of sight out of mind, but once I get back together, I just feel bad cuz i'm like Oh, I could have been close to my cousins. And I think definitely not being as close or not sharing as much with mariah angel it's when I noticed, like all the other relationships like oh crap. I should have been close to my cousin they're close to their cousins you know, but I was so busy being close to them that you know I wasn't really caring about anybody else, but now it's kind of like. You know I put all my eggs in the basket whatever so guys I think those are the things that are causing me to cut those were things I constantly think about over and over again mariah angel trina and then. Family that i'm like trying to be close you know, trying to reach out to but then i'd say it's hard for me to focus on today it's like i'd sort of think about. What I could have done in the past, it should have done in the past."
726.0,Provider,"I mean when you think about the interpersonal relationships, because I know that you. said that you feel like you put all of your eggs in one basket with with mariah and an angel and so when you're thinking. About into personal relationships in general it's um you know what's the deepest connection that you felt with another person who's the person that you would think Oh, I have really a true genuine connection with."
14252.0,Patient,"yeah definitely angel. that's pretty much it. More than my mom you know, like, even though I know my mom cares about me more it's, not that I think that they care about me more than my mom cares about me I don't think that, but I just know that. At a point yeah we had the most honest and I guess like deepest relationship were actually like really, really cared for them."
726.0,Provider,"Your family. I think the fact that you were able to spend some time there it's actually pretty Nice in you know, seeing them, even though you might not feel super close to them. um, but I wonder if there's more family that you could make some sort of connection with out of US there's anyone in weren't near you where you live."
14252.0,Patient,"um yeah i've been trying with my grandma because I feel like. Out of all family members she's the one that's actually like reaching out, so I still like i'd rather focus on her you know because, like, I have a cut a guy Tyson in California, I have a lot of cousins, I guess, but I have my one cousin in California. um. he's. You know I don't know he just had a baby, whatever the case and it's like I can text him but he's not search he's not trying to reach out, which is fine um. So yeah my grandmas who i've been trying to spend time with but I mean it's just it's not the same it's not like it's not the same. feeling I feel like, especially since i'm a jehovah's witness like. i'm usually closer to those like you know ages Jones witness so it's like they kind of become my spiritual family and then they become because we just have so much in common so it's like with my. normal family my actual family there's always like you know there's there's a lot of differences so. I try to be as close as I can but it's it's most likely wouldn't be as close as I am with those that i'm in the current nation with just because. We have the same yeah I don't know I feel like that that part of me is definitely stronger than my like. flawlessly family part, even just by the way, I was raised, I think, like my mom and my dad weren't really close to their family, so I think I didn't really grow those bonds, the only family, I was close to was my mom's parents, but they both died already and I think once my mom's parents. They were like the leak to this side the family that i'm staying with now so once they die then it's like that was our that's when we would get together was to see my grandma and grandpa so. yeah so it's kind of like. yeah i'm sure if I would have been raised with my mom being closer to her family and then my dad being closer to his family, then I would have built those bonds, but I didn't so I built bonds other places um, but I just really want to I really just want to. not worry about all this stuff and I don't want to think about the same things over and over again and. I don't really want to talk to angel because I just feel like there's not really nothing to talk about like deep, I would like to just keep it pushing and call her when I want or whatever, well, I thought really dark I don't know what oh think they just like um. yeah."
726.0,Provider,"I think you know, like when you feel cuz when I when you say inter personal connections with people, is it really sounds it's like i'm. In connection, like a feeling of lack of connection almost does that sound right."
14252.0,Patient,yeah yeah I feel like definitely a feeling of lack of connection.
726.0,Provider,"Between something like. Where, what do you feel like you're missing out on by not having these relationships with them. Like do you think it's more of like wanting what you had before, for not knowing of what's coming next."
14252.0,Patient,"And maybe a little bit of both definitely what I had before was really like. i'm already I felt super fulfilled and like I said I felt super full and like loved and all that so. yeah I think wanting what I had before, because I think for other people if I wouldn't have had that relationship how I have it, I think, for other people i'm doing pretty good you know I mean I have friends, I have family. it's just not how it used to be, but no, I definitely have friends, I can talk to, I have friends that want to support me whatever whatever but yeah I think just kind of. Wanting that what I had before, even if it's not what the same people it's fine, to be honest, it doesn't it's not even like I need to have it with them. But there's nobody else that I want to have it with either like i've been trying to like kind of you know, reach out a little bit. But yeah there's nobody that I really feel comfortable with and then also I feel like all the stuff with angel him right. yeah just kind of hold me back a little bit cuz i'm that's what i'm always thinking about."
726.0,Provider,"I wonder if that relationship could be used as a template for what do you want going forward because, like, I can you just said, like you're okay if it's if it's not them for maybe you know. Like viewing them in a way, as like that's a template of what you would like. Moving forward like if you were to meet new people like now that you know what it's like to feel. Emotionally fall and and connected to to people to somebody else, maybe using that as a template and then being kind of like open to how that would show up in your life in a different way good, because if it's not them right i'm sure. That they'll be somebody else some come through."
14252.0,Patient,"yeah so I just have to I. yeah be patient that's what I was like really trying to like. thinking that I really needed like just to be patient, but I really want to not think about it, I don't want to think about them all, I don't want to have those things thoughts all the time, like. i'm having the same thoughts."
726.0,Provider,ruminating thoughts. You said intrusive earlier to what are. your thoughts.
14252.0,Patient,"Well ruminating I guess would be I don't really know I just know, for me, the difference would be. Sometimes i'll just think about the same thing over and over again, and then, sometimes I actively try not to think about it or i'm actively trying to do something else, but I can't stop thinking about it so. And it's like I feel like everything. All the like I i'm only remembering the negative. Memories with angel and mariah so like it's still like even like there's I feel like I just have a lot of triggers like. Even just saying ruminating like I can remember exactly where I was, I was in my eyes room and I was like this was when I was depressed some other time. And I was like trying to tell her like Oh, you know I think I figured out what it's called what i'm doing in my brain and it's called ruminating thoughts. And I just didn't feel like she did not say I guess the feeling I felt was just like okay like there's so much other stuff going on i'm sure she was going through family stuff. And like i'm over here, trying to talk about my ruminating thoughts and I just remember that wasn't really received or anything so like i'll feel embarrassed I always feel embarrassed because i'll just always remember all these things that I am embarrassed about. And I was like that probably happened me telling her about ruminating thoughts that probably happened like. Three years ago, already. And, as she pauses me remember i'm sure she doesn't remember. wasn't really a big deal by just embarrassed. And like i've told her how I feel so embarrassed about how everything happened when I was living with them, and whatever. And she already told me, you know I mean you don't have to feel embarrassed I wouldn't feel embarrassed she's like it was a low point for you, it was a low point for us like. Everybody had all their stuff going on, like you, don't have to feel embarrassed it was just a lot what's going on at that time, so you know she's already told me that. But i'm still thinking about all the little things that happened during that time and feeling really bad about it, and so, then I feel like that affects. My relationship with her now because that's why i'm so anxious around her or that's why I think i'm so anxious around her and. So doubting myself and having low self esteem around her because I just think about all the things that I wish I would have done better or perfect you know so it's kind of like. it's really not serving me."
726.0,Provider,yeah.
14252.0,Patient,always remembering all these things that people have already told me it's just let it go.
726.0,Provider,you're blaming yourself for where the relationship is that now.
14252.0,Patient,"i'm Am I blaming myself a not a venture percent no, but I just wish I didn't feel I wish I could just move on and just. let go of all the stuff that she already told me don't worry about it, you know it's not like we haven't already talked about it but it's just seems like I don't want to let go being embarrassed by all these little things that most likely nobody remembers. yeah yeah you said how I felt that way before. yeah yeah I feel like that was the majority of our relationship before is I was so bad about some things. Out there about something and then I will call her and tell her and then she would be like, oh no it's okay blah blah blah and then we'd hang up and then i'd call her back like Oh, did I sound or or did I sound. Whatever and she'll tell me no I never hang up the phone with you thinking you sound dumb I you know so that was a long time, we would do that all the time, all the time, like. i'm I overthink about something and then I tell her about it and then she's like no don't worry about it, and so I feel like the shift now is just that I don't talk to her about it anymore, because I just feel like. i'm. Just I just feel like. we've done that, like, I feel like we're not. we're not at that point anymore. You know, we kind of had our little falling out and now we're back, but I feel like the change should be that i'm not always calling and doing that. So now it's just kind of I guess kind of like built up in me, but I feel like I would like to be able to let go of it by myself."
726.0,Provider,um. Your brain. You know processing that memory of like. feeling embarrassed and calling her would help. With the ending on stock because it just it almost sounds like you're feeling stuck in bernie's like you're. In the memory of. What you felt like you were embarrassed about and do where you would think I guess.
14252.0,Patient,"yeah. yeah I don't know if it's the memory of calling her that bothers me I feel like it's it's just now. All the things that I would usually call and like asked her about. Oh, was that okay was that bad was that dumb you know, whatever i'm like yeah I just want to be able to do that for myself. I don't know what that's called i'm not sure if there's a word for that."
726.0,Provider,feeling of. Like having the same thing over and over again.
14252.0,Patient,"Is that we know, maybe being more. i'm trying to say I don't know what the feeling like maybe I maybe i'm trying to be, I would like to be more self reliant or maybe I would like to be. More I mean of course self confidence course but."
726.0,Provider,"I think, to it. Because, because it has so much to do with relationships it's like. It I think you know coming from coming from. from childhood and then having that being disrupted that family that never seen the structure disrupted in a way, and then and then finally meeting like two people like that family that you connected with it makes sense that that is. That feels really difficult because you go from what you go from like you're born family which there was a lot of stuff going on there and then leading into another family that. You felt provided a lot of your emotional needs in a lot of ways, and so I think it is hard to to not care about them when you have that connection with them. But I think the foundational part would be the family that it came from, and having that feeling of disruption in relationships that in relationship dynamics, because it changed like that changed a lot of things. In your family for you and for everyone else's it seems like. So I think if if we were if we were to work on like. Like the obviously yes soft alliance is definitely important and they think it's something that everyone is working on all the time, but I think that if. If we if we can't if we can't start from the beginning, we can't like. The beginning is what were those family dynamics of hold you away that you found another family to go to that were that were loving, caring."
14252.0,Patient,that's a question you're asking.
726.0,Provider,"I guess i'm just stating it i'm i'm just making a statement it's not so much of a question for you, but i'm. This, I think that if we were to look at into personal relationships, it always start from the beginning and so those beginnings are really the foundational parts of where we will sink out what we need from other people if we're not getting it from there."
14252.0,Patient,yeah. yeah.
726.0,Provider,"I almost think sometimes too is because. And I don't know if this is how you feel a fee is not. Maybe it's not so comfortable going back to the past, either in wanting to move from where where you felt comfortable working for where you felt comfortable."
14252.0,Patient,"Well, I understand that."
726.0,Provider,"So, like we've we've done. Things before like let's say processing. And I know and you see it, from my perspective, anyway, even seem to get upset the fact that your brother kept showing up and not and I hate and I know that it's not something that you really want to. Go so much into but I, I think that. it's usually the things that you really, really don't want to do, or the things where the thing what's going to take it to the other side of it anyway um, so I think that connection, you know, regardless of where you're at how and how you feel about it up. It always ends up going back to to that past so i'm wondering if there's some sort of. On if there's some connection with these relation into personal relationships in general with your family background your foundational background, and I think that. Is is conflicting that might be conflicted with each other if that has anything to do with your feeling of disconnection from other people to. each other they're just yeah other than just them, not responding back, I mean. There is that that there is that feeling of i'm not feeling connected with these people and they were my people."
14252.0,Patient,yeah.
726.0,Provider,i'm sorry I feel like talking to circle.
14252.0,Patient,"No, I. I understand what you mean I understand and I yeah I agree and I don't I don't think it's that I. I don't think I don't want to do the stuff about my brother I just think it's kind of like oh I just hate. it's I know it's not a gimmick, I understand, but I think that's how I feel, and I feel like so I say those things just to like. Because I don't want to be that that person that's always talking about that are always you know, whatever so it's not necessarily that I mind I guess it's just more so, like once I fall into like how to occur, like once I fall into. Normal categories of what people like me fall into it's just like oh God all right fine it's not enjoyable but. I don't mind it's not I don't mind I don't feel like I don't want to do it it's just kind of like you would wish you with something else, or you would wish it could be like something cuz you know I just like that's just such a given it's just kind of like yeah no. darling yes i'm. Having negative effects from what happened with my brother, yes, but. This was there was something more. I guess proactive, but no yeah I agree with what you're saying on and yeah i'm not opposed to working on the foundational things because I feel like as you're talking. i'm like oh God, I just have to call it angel I just got a taller and sit her down and have this conversation and. I like right now I feel like I could do that I feel like I could probably do that, but the reason why. I want the counseling and all these things is because I just feel like I want to be coming from a more same place like instead of putting so much on these people. Who are actually not doing anything wrong, you know they're just being normal humans, but because I have formed these attachments that's why I feel like it's making me a little bit irrational and a little bit hyper Lee overly emotionally charged. So I just felt like. For me with counseling I just kind of wanted to get to a more level playing with it and look at things more rationally because. i'm coming to them like meeting a lot and I just think it's kind of. A little asking a little bit much because I think if I was a little bit more emotionally stable I wouldn't be asked you meeting so much."
726.0,Provider,"happy for you, what is asking for a lot, though. term so. In what way what would you say that the facts are of what makes somebody. um require a lot of energy for you, because maybe. i'm just curious about that because there's some people that have like. Have bigger bandwidth to give back to somebody or provide or be there for people and some people have like. Just like a more limited ability to do that, and I wonder if if if you're judging yourself as you needing it, but I wonder if, maybe if they're just not capable of it and it's not you."
14252.0,Patient,"yeah. Well, I think what is like. You said what. what's too much what did you say what was the question."
726.0,Provider,"Why, why do you think what you need from them, it would be too much for them to give."
14252.0,Patient,"I think, because I am i'm so emotional about it and, like so sad about it and could just like be crying and crying and crying without end about it and it's just kind of like. yeah it's just kind of like. I mean i've 150% already done that, with mariah for sure, like multiple times cried and cried and cried and cried and how you know I feel this way and I feel like you make me feel this way and I just kind of like. You know I just feel like at this point, you know i'm 29 and it's just kind of like the crying sessions are at. It you know communication is so important and being honest and open so important, but if i'm having if i'm about to have the same crying conversation with you it's just kind of like. I think it's been done already, so I don't really know and then for angel I feel like for angel I haven't been crying crying to her. But I just feel like she kind of. Like has her stand about things now like, before. We kind of like if she had to talk if she wanted to talk about her kids or whatever, she would talk to me, she would feel frustrated with like, she would cost him like, but now I feel like she wants to respect them more and not talk."
726.0,Provider,about their problems to me.
14252.0,Patient,"So, because of that, and if if that's what's going on with her, you know if she's stressed, because mariah is depressed or if she's this because rail is doing whatever rails doing. Or if you know monique has had her oldest daughter is having problems with her marriage, but she I I think I, and this is something I can ask her but it's like I feel like she does want to respect them more and not talk about their business. Which before. We would always talk about like what's going on, like oh i'm not even I don't know we we just talked about it so. yeah I feel like if that's what's going on and that's what's stressing her out and that's what's like. Her probably her things right now. that's kind of I think that's kind of where the relationship changed because it's like. that's kind of what's occupying her mind, but she doesn't want to talk to me about it, which is great it's fine, I understand, but. it's just kind of like so then that's where it is because she doesn't have before I feel like I was able to support her because she could talk and then you know I would talk and then I will talk about my problems, but then she was talking about her stuff. But now, if she can't talk about her stuff as freely and. Then that's shortening like that's limiting her bandwidth because."
726.0,Provider,"I think that's what's stressing her out and so she can't really talk to me because yeah. I know I just I mean maybe I said it, but. I almost wonder if, within their relationship dynamics of a family in. Italy, if maybe they they said something to her, maybe I don't know, maybe there's like a shift with them of. And I don't mean this in a bad way, but maybe they're like oh like you know where your family, but you you're you're really close to fb, why are you so close to her, not as close to us, maybe I don't know if that's. If that barely not have been a conversation between them, or even."
14252.0,Patient,"um I could see I don't think the conversation would be about the closeness for sure no I don't think that because I feel like we all had that relationship like. We were all close, so I don't think it was that, but I think I all I can say for sure, like when mariah was going through her stuff she has told me like. I needed to be like I couldn't talk to you because I could not break the trust of mariah which is fine, I actually don't have a problem with that. I understand that 100% but we just never came around from that you know what I mean like I get that and even since then mariah spoke to me like. My already called because it was like some stuff had to come out but angel on to make sure that more I was the one to say something so yeah she was it's fine that was literally like two months ago um but yeah I just feel like from that point we just never. We never came back, and I can see stuff before that, too, like, I remember, like a poly six months ago, or so something happened with the oldest daughter, and then the oldest daughter told me, and then I told angel like oh dang. I didn't know about that and then she was just like yeah. And then, it was like that's it like so it was it's like. yeah basically I guess. yeah I don't know I don't wanna ask too much just because it makes me feel bad about myself when i'm always begging for stuff you know, so I just feel like. that's what kind of holding me back from like talking more about it because I feel like. I just feel like. You don't I don't have to be told everything you can kind of just figure, you can kind of just. Go with. Like you can kind of read the room, I guess."
726.0,Provider,"yeah. um and because I know that you believe in God and in your jehovah's witness Have you ever prayed for god's intervention for clarity that kind of. For your situation, because I feel like there's like if it was if your situation was a house. it's like there are certain parts that are lit up and you can see the room and then there's parts that are darker and we were trying to figure out and make the connection what's over there what's over here. Because there's something like like Yes, this is about into personal connection with other people. And it's what is going on, like for yourself that's triggering so much of these emotions that are coming up, because you feel like they're not rational, so there it's coming from. From wall, it is rational but there's that intensity to them that feeling with them and so i'm I don't know i'm wondering if it's like asking for that could somehow help. help to see this in a different way, because we're not understanding it maybe we're not viewing it in the in the way that would be curious to understand that."
14252.0,Patient,"yeah and yeah I prayed about it all the time, and I feel like. I pray about it all the time and, yes, I agree with what you're saying, and I do feel like it's not rational I do feel like it's like. i'm just I just really want to let it go, you know but i'm emotionally like not ready. or able to um and yeah I pray about it. And it helps you know a little it helps, I think, but i'm still talking about it now with you, you know I mean it's like. yeah just kind of tired and then I and then like after this i'll probably maybe I don't know my pattern would be to feel bad and to feel embarrassed like. Why am I still talking about this and then so that's why i'm always trying to like remind myself, I can do whatever the heck I want in my own space it doesn't matter so it's like I can tell myself that but it doesn't change how I feel. And then. tell myself that again I can do whatever I want I can i'm in my own space i'm literally in my car i'm not affecting anybody else but then I feel bad you know so it's just kind of. like that."
726.0,Provider,"What I would say is if you're going to pray about it, and something that you're trying to. get some resolution with. Is our say. Sometimes, our emotions will also block us from even seeing things the way that they actually are like. You just affect like if someone's like anxious they're not going to see the whole situation because of the feeling, so if the emotions are overwhelming it's hard to see it with clarity and so. So I think that maybe we can buy the next session, it will see where you're at on the next session, but maybe do some processing work on just like. The feelings of what shows up for you when you're in your own space, because in this is the space that you're in it's like that self critical judgment of self. yeah it's gonna be really hard to feel good because i'm constantly having this conversation there my mind where i'm like. I should be over it, you know that is, that is, the critic in the mind that there and so that's good to not make you feel good and i'm wondering if we can tackle more of the self conversation the mental chatter that goes on in the mind."
14252.0,Patient,"yeah, I would like that um to talk about or process, the feeling I have feelings, I have when i'm by myself yeah."
726.0,Provider,"Think of it as an eagle to the like your essence of self will always be. Very compassionate with yourself and will be, it will it will give you the space to be where you're at in that moment, I feel like the ego is the part that goes. Why are you feeling sad about this, you shouldn't be feeling sad about it'll justify and it'll just run you in a circle and so just being even a little bit be be compassionate for yourself, is that. Yes, like it's it's hard to let go of a relationship that was once felt really great and doesn't feel good anymore. And there's nothing wrong with you for for feeling that the way that you do, and I know that intellectually I know they know that, but I understand what you mean the human not changing I understand that too."
14252.0,Patient,"yeah. Okay yeah, so I would yeah I. know. Next time."
726.0,Provider,"For the next session, this is what I do with journaling exercise is write down the feelings that you felt with. With the family with mariah and angel of all of good good bad whatever write them all down and write all of the feelings that you feel about your family and where you came from. and see if there's any connections at all or or if you see the total opposite feeling from each other, so I felt this way, but I felt totally opposite here. She seeing where they are similar and where they are totally different. So just write the basic raw emotions that show up for you, with your your your biological family and then with this family and let's see what if there's any connections between them and go from there."
14252.0,Patient,"Okay yeah that sounds good. So for next week. yeah cuz I guess I gotta go cuz my class starts at eight or 10 minutes. So for next week, do I have an appointment with you. I don't see."
