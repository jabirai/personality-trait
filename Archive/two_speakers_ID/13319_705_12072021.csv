13319.0,Patient,"goes well before I love saying okay let's just get over or let's say goodbye. i'm loving same for like a couple months ago I had my step Father passed away and that was the last goodbye to me to like to a point where I can say goodbye, because it just there's a flashback."
705.0,Provider,"yeah I could see where that would happen Alberto, especially because they happen pretty recent."
13319.0,Patient,yeah and saying goodbye like that to like a group is like I don't know. Like oh I can't say goodbye kairos something like bring back a memory. yeah.
705.0,Provider,"And and that's where you know. If you fill up to it before you know you just continue working with us, you can you can go back into the group and just say you know by if. If you fill up to. It If not, then that's OK, you and I will keep working with. What your than this was did you say this was your your stepfather."
13319.0,Patient,"That it passed yeah yeah always because I as a child, I I wasn't formally with my actual Father due to a family problems and social worker getting involved so i'll say I mostly my life was more raised with him, then when the actual father. And so, like I guess that that would probably be the main reason why i'm saying goodbye isn't something i'm good at."
705.0,Provider,"Did you have a chance, with him, though, did you get some closure to tell him like how much he meant to you and things like that."
13319.0,Patient,"Now really cuz i'm the oldest and I was uh yeah like I can say we had our times like or like we. Like we weren't like this, but when we were close it wasn't just me and him, it was like with everyone the whole family so like now, one person was left out, but like I could say that. yeah I could say we're close but not like oh one on one. I did work with them enough but not like I like Oh, like me and him spend time together alone not really."
705.0,Provider,"Did you know at the. Did you know, at the end that he was going to be passing or was this something that had happened, all of a sudden."
13319.0,Patient,"whoa he had an addiction to. and Time that came on like studying Is it because it's an unexploded were either they said it was an overdose or too much was. But we didn't because every time we see so let's say we left on a Friday here and come back, like the whole week later, and I guess the first time, we were tripping borrowers care, but at some point we were like Okay, we used to come back Monday or i'll come back next week, but then. I guess one point, they said, you know what he's not coming back, he was in the hospital for like a cool segments and. All of us have to be there, he our side of the family and his side of the family therapy RSA is goodbyes and it was a struggle, because. we're not his blood, but he only has one daughter, and she was she was she still under eight but, at the time she was under is to see him in the hospital, we have some Duran we are like car who know who to like when there's blood actually see him for the last time. Having to see them like they they won't my mom was obviously she told me hey like go cmi who knows what would happen next, and. I was scared to say like go see oh my God I I had so much return to see him by kidding cuz it's like I wasn't I wasn't prepared or I wasn't able to like stand up for myself and be like Okay, you know what i'll go see him. And when I did was the last day where they had her like disconnected from everything like turn them off and. That was my first goodbye, and then saying goodbye again a funeral. My first funeral and I hope to I hope for it to be my last funeral cuz. i'm going to be one of those they really suck for me and having to bury someone like to close the layer on someone like on a cascade like a her. I got friends like I found like. i'm like okay like this normal say it's whatever like. It happens in life, like it's supposed to happen it's god's plan for when they say when you're in the shoes it's just like it hurts a. Like I don't know like to me, I feel, like all kids comms plan it's whatever I was afraid, but when I had to go through. Right, it was like I don't know I just felt like the website like deep inside my it just left me speechless two worlds like I can, I can say goodbye to anyone else or. I don't know I just feel something like that again."
705.0,Provider,"yeah I think a lot of times Alberto it's hard with death and and you know, because you have so many emotions tied to that person, and you know there's there's different stages that we go and afterwards, you know with the grieving process."
13319.0,Patient,"mm hmm. for that. I don't know like because the only time I this one after that was like. On thanksgiving like. Before thanksgiving my mom everyone in the household Tommy cozy and go visit him at the funeral or at a cemetery. A I kept telling myself like I every time they told me again just like brings it shoots a flashback can. I know. I, I was unable to like I guess it was a. When I started was because before I guess when I told the Court that hey like. This, how can I enter hey like. i'm not ready to like more like. to lay low for that, right now, at the moment because, like someone important pastor i'm alive like so say I wasn't stable at the moment and people telling me all go see and go visit me I just couldn't do it, and when I went on thanksgiving like I walked up and. I don't know, for some reason I was like Oh, you know. I know where everything goes well, the way I expected it I just. walked up and and there are like on their screen like is I to me like I picture myself and other people shouldn't tell a person screaming. Like change there's a change in her voice like like they all of a sudden, they go from like all walking on almost like exploring I don't know that makes sense, like evening for holding into law it just exploded inside me and. I felt like ever since that day I ended up losing the eye contact to people and they're losing the. Communication of people like because, if I need you to do something I say go hearing, I was born like I tell everyone hey you know any is what do I do this this and now it's just like I could barely keep up with a decent conversation. to play the issue forward, I just asked questions like over and over again, like even if it's as simple as just kidding I won't keep it I. Keep it the same but they're not circle are probably I lost my temper communication."
705.0,Provider,"You feel like that, since that time Alberto that it like it stunting your growth for a moment, like almost had to take a pause after his passing."
13319.0,Patient,"yeah and i've been telling well i've been telling people like well i've been telling myself that like, why is it after a certain time, I still can't get over like. I know it's hard to believe for like like i'm like oh my God something have family. And it's already been too long, I should get over, but then there's like a point where like if. it's already been I guess it's like what 20 years and I still can't get over like. I don't know like I just stuck in a loop like oh my God like come on like move on, you have to suffer alone feeling. Like oh no i'm just taking a loop. Okay."
705.0,Provider,"yeah and you know a lot of time with the grief cycle is first Alberto is usually like denial. Like a lot of times, people are either shocked, or they fear. or they have avoidance, you know, the denial that someone is going to you know be passing. And, and then do you remember that did you know, like when you knew that he may be passing did you have like a denial like Oh, he can't be you know going to pass."
13319.0,Patient,"yeah see I do remember worlds, I mean I even gonna come back. And I guess. I you know, I was under percent sure myself that all that was just on like I got him believe the dog is over, you know dogs are just training a only do it for the money like dang and they initially we're just wasting time let them bring them back home. Well, as what we are. and"
705.0,Provider,"That is normal Alberto that you know person goes through confusion shock, just like you were saying you wanted to bring them home you wanted to make it like go away. And then the second stage that usually happens is anger we're then you're irritated or anxiety or frustration about their death. With a person leaving did any of that happen for you."
13319.0,Patient,"um I studied will day of the funeral people started telling me oh hey don't put your shoes and his and his place where, like you, you be the manor house. you'd be the bigger person like no just just be the next item, for your brothers and sisters or overlooks have to you and I guess after a certain time I study. I study. This. Myself like. Being inclusive of like where i'm yelling at people I lose patience I. And I guess that was another reason why I got to like to see if I was able to get hopeful thing like anger management anger management, I guess that's what it's called."
705.0,Provider,"Right and that's where to then from from that anger, or you become extra irritable and maybe even aggressive towards others. Then, with the state they call it the grief cycle, then it usually moves into more bargaining and bargaining is where you might struggle with to find meaning find meaning in your life. You may reach out to others or tell your story, have you have you noticed that after your stepfather is that. You started struggle with maybe finding like what what is life mean to you."
13319.0,Patient,"um. I I wish I could see yours, but then i'm not sure about it, oh. No, I i'm not sure about that one I don't know but, though."
705.0,Provider,"Okay, usually after that then then comes depression and depression is more feeling overwhelmed helplessness more hostility and Canada that flight filling where you just want to leave and the filling of depression."
13319.0,Patient,"I first I first I did feel the pressure, like a couple like after like after a moment I started feeling and I don't always feel bad like I kept pushing and so like I never had the show and I never felt this sort of like pain inside like. For someone like me or for someone else's that's been clue. I don't know it just me for a minute like a couple more like when I mean when I mean like a month or so and then off they'll see I tried to I tried to like nothing about it, like Oh, you know I. don't like i'm not going to think about that, but I like I try to move on, but I do have my certain days like. damn I still can't believe it, I also have my dad i've been down but. Not like during the day, while my. grandma are feel so depressed and. I can do a little work like that."
705.0,Provider,"Right, but it is like you explained it very well of our toe is just where you're kind of like dang that happened, and you just feel like an overwhelming of sadness that that happened and then he's no longer with you. And the last stage Alberto is then moving into acceptance and that's where you explore off it's like you feel like, then, that you can move on, that you can move forward."
13319.0,Patient,"uh. Is it okay I didn't like I didn't quite like sort of I sort of got it, but then I sort of thought that part just how many trick like tripping out for me."
705.0,Provider,"yeah so what the sentences it's kind of where you're like Okay, you know this happened and. you realize that you know you explore options like you know you can't bring them back and and you know that you miss them, but you start to accept it more like your step dad was gone and you see that he was a father figure for for you and then. Maybe that changes at that last stage where you feel more like grateful that he was part of your life. And it's where you still miss him, but the missing him in the morning hill doesn't take priority you feel more of you are grateful to have him in your life and he was a big important person and that sometimes you might have those happy memories come up. To help you Lord."
13319.0,Patient,"yeah you know what yeah I could say that that's a that's honestly like yay a 90% true, but then, when I do an ashtray is just saying the ones where I always got your banner hey the trouble per night oh my God. I target like I tried to do it to myself, where if i'm alone or work or they so I just come home, and I see no one here um I look at the House and my dad like. Who knows, like a year ago we were both outside let's say well we'll both of us outside we're about to get in a fight or arguing this this and if those type of. memory triggers or like memory flashbacks and i'm just saying it certainly isn't normal that i'm getting those type of problems in my head, or is there going to be a promise we later on either gonna affect me some great I don't know."
705.0,Provider,"What the death like that Albert Tobin it being the. First, death of someone that you really. loved on that. You know this was your first experience. It can stop you in your tracks and you don't know how to fill you don't know how to think about it, so your brain was having a catch up with your heart, because your heart misses them, and it was sad and so morning that. loss, and so, when you have that happen, it takes time and sometimes you may feel like you're not yourself for a while. And I usually will get easier like today. When we talked about it, you seem like you're very open about it and that you're able to talk about it, whereas maybe before if it was like right afterwards that you wouldn't have been okay and comfortable talking about it."
13319.0,Patient,"Yes, yeah like I couldn't move on. I might let's say neighbors would kind of like a will happen like on nothing it's just something it's a family thing like I keep so smiling they're like you need her like when people recently like hey be anything or anyone. Let me know i'll take you somewhere we'll do this, I felt so uncomfortable a dude you got you you you you guys in your shirt so you know when I need it, you guys are when I asked for no one showed up. I don't offer for like that that first."
705.0,Provider,"yeah and a lot of emotions are there were. Because people you felt like they weren't there for you that you might also become tearful and be like just really in the mood, the moment of feeling down and depressed."
13319.0,Patient,yeah I felt I felt like I could say not have said but someone like angular wow like I like now I realized. Like what kind of friends or have or what kind of so many people I knew very little sort of. I was something I experienced like noticing my so.
705.0,Provider,"yeah it does cause Alberto when you miss someone and when someone dies in your life is you start sometimes it causes you to reflect. Like What is the meaning of my life, what is the purpose of my life what am I doing here and then evaluating like do I have good friends and what what am I doing here."
13319.0,Patient,"yeah I started thinking like that so at the beginning, I was like oh like what what do I do or. or well like. whoa whoa whoa whoa whoa life I don't know I felt like I was I do I change of just because this happened or. or a gave me so many questions to myself, like what do I do what Why am I here, or what happened next or oh damn I gotta be honest, it by just reading this right here on my end up seeing another one for like."
705.0,Provider,"It it causes you to contemplate Alberto and you know, like you were talking about earlier it's almost a sense of where you. feel. Like stuck and where you avoided people and maybe you didn't talk to him as much. we're now in part of moving forward. is starting to open up again, like, I know, last time we talked part of what you wanted to do was effective communication skills with interacting with adults have you been able to maybe have some of those. You know, honest conversations."
13319.0,Patient,"yeah i'm. I right now, like oh my God my mom in the morning, so I, and I was scared because I came to a new site or work and there's no signal and almost like. My parents about scheduling I want to show like I really forward to doing this and, like this i'm gonna I don't want to miss this is from my from my good like no one else. And I don't have service and i'm like running up i'm going like down the hill the hill going through street like women forming the hammock any service and. yeah and there was an owner here like that caught on my brother hey Sir like. I know, to do so, I was like hey like i'm scared i'm like i'm shy and make i'm sorry to bother you but hey I like. Being with it through zoom and I was wondering if you click lend me some Internet I like I started having my roughly like putting myself initially. he's really asking me for it and then i'll say often nervous and he's like no no it's okay it's it's for your benefit it's okay and. I was like thank you and I got so happy over and over for like, and that is that, like a first step to the communication or the I just bothered him for like 15 seconds just asked him for."
705.0,Provider,"That was really good congratulations on berto that's being assertive and that you, you said something, because you needed something you said something in the way you said it was perfect. that's assertive. That was great and then like you said now your needs are met, and you were able to meet."
13319.0,Patient,"I don't know I feel really cares if someone new industry like oh hey i'm calling you and, like. it's a it's like the same thing with earth like when i'm like haley or, like last time, when I didn't break down my my appointments and I. Am I bothering had a moment where we're not communicating and we're not doing like me interrupting I could question what is she reading what is she. doing something what is she's at the store I have so many ideas in. A way."
705.0,Provider,"that's you know berto is part of like you working on communication that's just being assertive is saying something when you need something and that's what that's what you did so, I think that that's really good. And this is causing where you were talking about, you know that you feel like. you're getting unstuck where you're starting to set that someone important in your life you no longer have them here. You still missing. I think you're still there is, it is it freezing the Internet, maybe yeah it's I can still see you."
13319.0,Patient,Oh it's good yeah i'm having bad Internet right now.
705.0,Provider,Okay that's.
13319.0,Patient,that's okay. that's why I didn't want things to have like that.
705.0,Provider,"that's Okay, you know Martha already you were able to share a lot and I commend you I wanted to ask to because another one of your goals, so you met that you know to me that goal, where you were going to try to be more open and use."
13319.0,Patient,assertiveness skills. I think that.
705.0,Provider,yeah. Can you still hear me i'm missing one. Okay.
13319.0,Patient,"A little bit very, very little."
705.0,Provider,"I wanted to ask you if you were able to practice your deep breathing exercises to manage your anxiety, like any of your deep breathing that you were doing."
13319.0,Patient,"Oh yeah i've been doing that and, like I realized that. it's scary like yo like I don't know I thought it we like I I got four more calm, but then I get tired and let's just say it gives it some sort of I never done it like. I don't put it like I don't know like i'm always like i'm always like oh hey like I need this done, I need this or really right away i'm just like. And then, when they when I started no actually the first day I actually went to the group meetings I thought weird and awkward that they were telling me oh hey meditate stretch, too, is that when I did it when when I was at home at home or here. Actually, before this I ended up doing it, and I was scared because I was like what is she catches me doing this. So we."
705.0,Provider,"know how many times a week, are you able to do the meditation."
13319.0,Patient,"i'm normally I do. I do before I wake up. I do it on my break. Which is like an hour like in the middle of day and. All I could say in the night, but then i'm like I don't keep score that but normally when I do wear my watch during the weekend I do like every time, like every hour every time you asked me."
705.0,Provider,wow so so pretty much you're doing meditation on a daily basis.
13319.0,Patient,"So that I, I could say that I do it like oh hey like I need to do it, I could do it yeah maybe you're in there, but then i'll do it, but i'm not sure what did I just do I do it off guard like whoa like I don't know it's."
705.0,Provider,"it's becoming more automatic. So when you're stressed and. More that's a good that's good news, how How long do you think that your typical when you when you do the deep breathing is it for like five minutes 10 minutes 20 minutes."
13319.0,Patient,"Anything I could probably say is because i'm not used to it, so I just we're all here like I need to do it now i'll do it for one or two minutes like I can't like. I could probably like yeah I say one or two minutes I can I can take a for like four or five minutes doing that, like. How come I used to you."
705.0,Provider,"And, and thank you for your honesty so with that they're Alberto. How about in your treatment plan. B, then, for your deep breathing. For at least every day for one to two minutes."
13319.0,Patient,"Why during word I normally do it on my way home. or. yeah I could do it before going to bed you driving home. Line yeah i'd normally do in the morning or going home one of those two would work. Okay, I was on my free time."
705.0,Provider,"yeah and so with with the setting that as a goal, because, like you said you're going to get more used to it more used to it. So if you can be mindful to do that at least every day and then one to two minutes and then try to build up from there if you feel like you're getting more benefits from it and try to work up to three minutes."
13319.0,Patient,"i'm ready yeah like I remember the first time I went to the group I i've been getting mad our word to where i'm question are you are you up surena you mad i'm like no and I walked to a room or 1000 I do like deep hardcore breathing like. i'm underwater and then, just like. i'm not mad at, let me just go to a row and i'll give you an answer right back on oh my. Goodness I walk away like some way once a day by new forget about it."
705.0,Provider,"yeah that's that's an awesome benefit of it Alberto is that you're using a to not only to reduce your anxiety, but you're doing, and also to utilize anger management skills that's an anger management skill to take a. timeout and then the do something different to distract."
13319.0,Patient,"I know I really like well like before you go I would see my survey I get my for every like if someone I take putting drives on Sunday morning. and doing it next to my window I open it or like shutter like let me sleep go with like in an hour tour now I just like my God, like their opi matters will be able to. i'll say comma butter. Like i'll get mad about it, but just like to certainly again i'll go to the bathroom in I don't know wash my face or yell at the very like okay. Getting bad for something that is supposed to happen, like that."
705.0,Provider,yeah isn't it nice though Alberto when you can release some of your own stress and by removing yourself from a situation deep breathing and coming back. Your head oh.
13319.0,Patient,"It is, I see yeah I could say it is like on last week, I had an issue with one of my family members, and it was to a point where it was. Like almost physical contact and then someone else barging in this, and I was like you know what let me see. take a deep breath. Go to my time, but I, you know it was something that. I right, it was just it wasn't it wasn't it wasn't worth it, and I was like oh hey you know we get we so we started. Saying sorry i'm just like oh hey you know my ballet get a just walk away, I still have to get the like Dan like we just do we're just happy in and I don't think exchange and. walking like like I actually thought about like hey I don't want to get into fighting to a point where i'm gonna like. Get in a physical fight, and then the next day see that person i'm like wow like yesterday we had a fine today. enough for something that wasn't like I thought about I was like damn I must see the person tomorrow and like it's not like, we should, I take the bread or calm down or step away and i'll let boom I did that."
705.0,Provider,"yeah yeah and you know there's Alberta, so the deep breathing removing yourself, those are great techniques that you're doing and then another one that helps to decrease, you know stress a lot of times is any form of exercise D, do you like to exercise."
13319.0,Patient,I tried it I I did try it for two days I don't like my resolve tactics or I felt like I felt like carly I cannot work on me why did I worked out. consorts yeah I tried to like. The meditation I do.
705.0,Provider,"Okay, with exercise what kind of exercise, did you try."
13319.0,Patient,"um I try to do jump rope. jump rope I tried to do. This it was like we try to us, because we have a bit sort of a big property and I was like you know, let me go for a run. But then I find I find running like boring if it's like the same loop around the House or the you know this. And we get the kids and we get everyone together i'm hoping, you know let's just throw the ball at each other back and forth, as long as it's something wrong to distract there so saying yeah I did that for like a week it was worth it."
705.0,Provider,"Okay, then that that you were sharing Alberto that was worth it, throwing the ball back and forth you like that."
13319.0,Patient,"I did, but I, like the results, the next morning when I was in my teens or to get on to get up and I was like I almost feel like crying this isn't now that you know I can I hate I first time that you know I love being sore but then i'm just saying. I want to cry because I don't I hate being sore like that sort of like that."
705.0,Provider,Could you then find a medium where you're not overworking yourself where you're going to be sore but you do something a little bit more.
13319.0,Patient,"Moderate that's the problem, because then I tell my story my window work is because I want to work like my lead me to where i'm tired tired."
705.0,Provider,So you're tired you're tired tired. But then you don't like feeling sore the next day so where's the balance for you.
13319.0,Patient,"So if i'm tired i'll say damn i'm tired of word i'll get home, and I do want to do something i'll still be like you know where it's going to jump room. And the next morning I find my results hey i'm sore but i'm not tired say yo yesterday you were not you were tired, but not so, but then today it's so but you're not tired, are all it's just it's a weird bag."
705.0,Provider,"Could could it be Alberto that maybe if you went through that for a week, do you think you know, then maybe that's the following week let's say you exercise, maybe 20 minutes a day rather that's a walk or jump. rope or push ups or lifting. If you dedicated 20 minutes a day, do you think, then the week following that maybe your body would get more used to it to."
13319.0,Patient,"This because one. Because I feel like because I know when i'm at work, I don't say like i'm always walking i'm always doing, I mean either squatting sitting, I mean not soon squatting walking running. i'm always i'm never sitting like i'll be on my phone Stanley but like it'll be like for a minute or two for that I will say I can't like i'll be eight hours standing or walking around."
705.0,Provider,Oh hi. phil you're already.
13319.0,Patient,At home it's probably be some. yeah. Like that yeah I feel like them work our way then i'd be at home.
705.0,Provider,"Okay, do you want to even change that, then, are you happy with that your job you have enough exercise."
13319.0,Patient,"uh yeah I do like I like yeah I just say that i'm happy to hear that i'm like losing oh like. i'm killing time by exercising or doing. More things here, then I would do at home, like if i'm at home i'm like on a Sunday. The first thing comes to mind is lazy Sunday like not doing anything to stay in bed, and I hate that like it's not only they are, but then I rather take the day I don't know it's just weird it's a weird about."
705.0,Provider,"It can be so so it's your day off and you want to do a little bit of nothing but then your brain tells you it's your day off, you should do something."
13319.0,Patient,Is that what it is.
705.0,Provider,"yeah yeah. Could you have it both ways Alberto were maybe part of the day, you do nothing but then you plan something each weekend."
13319.0,Patient,"I I I tell myself hey do something on Sunday do it early so you have the rest of the day, but then I feel like I feel myself rushing muscle. In La because it's my only day off and i'm like you want to go to the model from this time to this time I want to do it at the last minute to get all this little more one to one story get all I guess soon as possible, career first thing I want to sleep before my time. or. system."
705.0,Provider,"You want a better system, what do you think would be a better system than."

705.0,Provider,"Okay, so what would a something that you wanted to do is on the weekend to rest up, but then do one thing like cook or something that you could do inside."
13319.0,Patient,"Now why i've been doing that i'm like I don't really like it felt weird to me that I got up on Sunday started cooking earlier like I. Like I like I looked at them my goal I looked at my reflection of what in the world, I do you don't cook on a Sunday you weren't even get up early to do it on a Sunday, why are you open. To myself, I thought okay cuz my cat came from the beginning and look like what are you talking to I felt weird I was like no go away like it's a memo I don't know I just for me."
705.0,Provider,Was was it relaxing for you to make yourself something to eat.
13319.0,Patient,"yeah like I have my headphones on like like like I just put them on and counseled all the noise around me I ended up throwing in a blender. And yet there was people in the living room sleep like in the living room think they had a party, the day before. So they are like I don't believe Swanton to the couch and diane i'm over here like. cooking making so much noise and I didn't notice that I got yo hey you're making so much noise and. Obviously, what the head say you don't hear anything at all so."
705.0,Provider,What is that something you're interested into to. Focusing on as a goal like maybe one time on your weekend to do something that's relaxing but indoors.
13319.0,Patient,"I love cooking with a passion, like our current. Like cook cook cook oh my God like i'm curious like it's like signs your creative you're mixing who knows, work together. To make something at the end, but that I can say oh like how could something really good I kind of like i'll have that mindset, what is the food is and what, if I could get bought or. i'll make small portion of it, but then also how that might say were like it's made me today, Mr do you can throw that you're gonna make it I don't know it's something like that."
705.0,Provider,Okay. Would you like to make that a goal to maybe. One time a week make something that's healthy.
13319.0,Patient,"huh. yeah you know I could try like I write a story last week i'll probably do like oh hey it's my day off I don't cook again yeah but I I can't watch the cookie every week like here and there, yeah."
705.0,Provider,"So here here and there, you don't think you'd be able to every week."
13319.0,Patient,"Like let's say last week at the cookie policy delay or a you know what Saturday or Sunday, I will play a thought I want to migrate, at least, and I got change it oh. yeah i'm gonna move. Like for cooking i'm doing."
705.0,Provider,"Okay, I like that then alberto's to the goal to me sounds more like you're saying you want on the weekends, to at least do one thing, besides just that just sitting and sleep yeah like. yeah yeah there. are riding your bike. Oh, I normally just say."
13319.0,Patient,"walk I like i'll like i'll do i'll have something like hey you know what i'll do this like i'll say hey you know we're on Saturday on the weekend Okay, but then i'm like you know i'm not a free cookie and we're like Let me make it up for something else, like i'll do something else. yeah yeah."
705.0,Provider,"Okay, could it be, maybe, something that at least takes 20 minutes of your time."
13319.0,Patient,"i'm alia men now you know. An hour yeah I may give i'm gonna do something I needed to be done, like you know I started something, because I hate that like i'll start thinking. it's like a video game i'm starting the game, I want to finish the game like I don't want to go a little by little cookie like I don't want to just leave the food like halfway there."
705.0,Provider,mm hmm.
13319.0,Patient,Very done like that i'll do something like that yeah yeah. 120 minutes.
705.0,Provider,"Okay that's good and that's good where you set the minimum almost 20 and if you do more that's even better. I like this, so then. To me then Alberto is because you were saying that you like flexibility he wanted things to choose from, but it also gives you were on the weekends that it doesn't like the weekend comes and goes, you know where at least."
13319.0,Patient,"If you knew yeah. You feel like we have more of a weekend. yeah like Monday through Friday, it was so quick and then Saturday and Sunday goes like this, so quick as well, but i'm saying. Why can you guys go slow and then the weekend goes like that we did go fast as something on a lag like I want to do something, unless you're on a Saturday, but then time because time like unlike you look up and you're like bringing like whoa like it's already 538 already gonna."
705.0,Provider,get there.
13319.0,Patient,"Like Oh, I have plans today and I couldn't do it certainly comes your last day. You they are you like doing so yeah i'll try to fit in like what 20 to 40 minutes on a Saturday, maybe on a Sunday because I hate something that's the thing like. i'll be stuck on a Sunday and I just like I rather be at work than be at home, but then when i'm at work, I feel like I want to be at home. can be."
705.0,Provider,kind of you want you want the opposite of what you're doing.
13319.0,Patient,"yeah I don't know it's just, we all know, yeah something like that. yeah."
705.0,Provider,"Well then, that's where you know by you, exploring this that's neat because, on the weekends you're saying, I want to sleep, but I also want to get out and do something, where I can. You like I had a weekend off, so this is nice that you put that as a goal."
13319.0,Patient,"it's just fooling I get tired of eating on a Saturday night yeah cuz i'm at work i'm used to like hey you eat up morning leader after knowing in newly if you want to when you get home on a Saturday and eating and eating I get tired of you and I don't want to eat it I start thinking. i'm tired of eating like I don't want you, for the rest of my life that's the thing I tell myself it's just really do I eat are doing. Right."
705.0,Provider,"yeah. Trying to you know, sometimes on the weekend, with all that time, like you were saying before you know it it's like you've been putting a lot of thoughts about what to do, and then the weekend is over the hours have already counted down. Do you feel like Alberto with time management, I know that was one of your your goals you know to. make appointments and to attend groups and things like that. Do you feel like that that goals been then met where you're able to keep up a little bit more with your."
13319.0,Patient,"appointments and I could say yeah sorta but, after having the. Decision decision to like because I like I don't know if this Friday the economy that group meeting I don't know you know. But I because I don't don't want to show to a group anymore, I rather like be the last let's say the last four Besides, this one, the last sessions, I rather be like us today. I feel like we have less time together, and I have more time with them, I don't find to me i'm kind of like I, my request was like oh hey, let me just see a therapist a one on one and I saw that all he you have more groups than therapy session, which is. I try to tell them like hey like I don't want our room meeting, but I rather be with like I rather be with my therapist one on one more, but I don't know like a monster for certain this writing."
705.0,Provider,"What they would like you to do Alberto because part of the program is the groups, but now that you're you're going to start doing you know, like without seeing me more often your group, what we call care intestines care intensity is set for one time, a month. So if you can go just once in December than it fulfills that care intensity of attending just one time. Would you be able to do that, then."
13319.0,Patient,So cuz I mean we're we're both gonna finish before December right.
705.0,Provider,"And it looks like right now actually let me ask you this, did you find out to oberto the duration remember you were going to check to see like how long the sessions, and they were different ones like a medical follow up if that counts."
13319.0,Patient,"Okay, the weird part was that I asked the guy with a time duration can hate doing the meeting where my counter need a time, all I got was yes. that's we yes and then with the word is like yes now works like I didn't get like oh hey you need 30 minutes hey. I didn't. Mind yeah and I was like i'm not gonna ask again because of whatever you asked what did they send me the same thing only okay I just make sure that as long enough or as long as it's completed something like that that's all I got it."
705.0,Provider,"yeah because, if I look at this like the first time on. You did patient medical evaluation I don't know how long that one took, but that was like one appointment and then, when I looked at the next the BP you did with me, and that was the evaluation so that's two meetings, then you're pure support, I think that one was a shorter meeting. That one and peer support it looks like you checked in at 1840 and you checked out at 1844 so four minutes later."
13319.0,Patient,"yeah That was what you did I think your clinical assessment. I think. I don't remember doing I do remember. Doing an assessment, I just don't remember the topic you okay."
705.0,Provider,"So with peer support you know if you're looking at time I don't know if there was more into that So then, when I go up to your next meeting you had a MED follow up for 15 minutes on the 28th 1028. So let's. let's say if they count that one, then that would be three. And then, when we go into you went to a group on 1029 so that would be for you did an individual and the fourth."
13319.0,Patient,"So what wouldn't they um okay so it's wonderful. Just to make sure, because I I don't want to like Oh, he can I feel like they just like I just want to really clearly like or how many how many have mean like and you. How many times have we me and you may like that's what i'm worried about whatever I got the animals like oh here, let me just complete the last two and they like a, this is a you did. For meetings or five meetings aside like or haley they weren't they weren't they weren't the recommendations I gave you something i'm worried about the moment."
705.0,Provider,"Right and that's that's where it's unfortunate Alberto that they didn't give you a clear answer about the MED final follow up, so I hear your concern so going off of that, then I would look into then how many sessions, you did with me individual sessions. versus or a. group sessions."
13319.0,Patient,"yeah that's something like i'm more concerned about like oh hey like I want to put what I did a side with other people, and like kind of those two groups and you'd be more like my point right now."
705.0,Provider,Okay that's.
13319.0,Patient,"Nice that's why i'm asking if the. If, like if. I don't know if I have the option to like stop going to the groups and attend you more I don't know that's an option for me."
705.0,Provider,"For what i'm seeing Alberto it's showing on the care intensity one time, a month, so you win in November, so if you could go one time, a month in December that would meet that care intensity. Because they do with the with the program we do groups and individual. And if you do that in December than you and I, let me see, though i'm going to go by individual groups, so you and I, on the night on 916 we did our bps so that would be counted as a session that's when I asked you all the questions about your history, the first time we met. So that's going to be will count individual so that's one. And then another individual, then you met me on the fourth so that's two then individual wise you met me on the 30th. that's three."
13319.0,Patient,mm hmm.
705.0,Provider,And then you met me today that's for.
13319.0,Patient,i'm only done. flowing that's for individual.
705.0,Provider,"Now let's see groups, if I look group wise it looks like group lies, you did. Your first group looks like it was on the 29 1029 so that's one. Then it looks like another group was on. that's to. You did another group on 1112 that's three. Another one on the. that's for. So, then, that would be for so you've done for individuals and for groups so you've done eight if you're only counting groups and individual sessions."
13319.0,Patient,"i've done eight in total. Okay, so. So coming today it's four to five for us."
705.0,Provider,Counting today would. Make for individuals. And then you have four groups so that's a.
13319.0,Patient,OK OK so i'm a so that Friday it's five for the group and then.
705.0,Provider,You would need seven total more can you do 15 right.
13319.0,Patient,But I was hoping to do like the last couple with you as a sort of the group. yeah after so after this Friday I am only stuck doing the things most i'm stuck doing more with you right.
705.0,Provider,"Right, but it is just for the month of December one time to meet that that care intensity for the group. So you could go into a group you don't have to share if you're not comfortable. That that would probably be your last one So then, if you go to that group then that's going to be nine total. And then that would leave you with six more things to do after Friday. Six more times that you would meet."
13319.0,Patient,"yeah I remember that I have learned something on the 29th can I, because now that i'm like clearwater I can I would you be able to like skip that for me."
705.0,Provider,yeah rather how good it is. yeah on the 1229 it's at 12pm the rap sessions.
13319.0,Patient,yeah.
705.0,Provider,I will put in that you want to cancel that.

705.0,Provider,"rate and what you can do, then Alberto if the if you don't pay. To come per session sometimes people do, and they need to go to the virtual Center or they leave a credit card if they do campaign that if you don't have those you can you can still cuz it'll just need to show that you attended.

13319.0,Patient,"I know. I see, I see the slow progress."
705.0,Provider,"It is you know, like anything if something's new it takes a while to like make it routine, just like with the meditation is you're now seeing the benefits of it and you're starting to do it more automatic."
13319.0,Patient,"mm hmm there so so okay cuz i'm like i'm confused so when, after this I text the number saying hey I checked on on checking in."
705.0,Provider,"yeah what you can do and I will send them one to you just when you text that number, and you can even do it right now, if you have your phone, you can text it why we're talking."
