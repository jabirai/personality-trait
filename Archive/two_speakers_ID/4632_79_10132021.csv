4632.0,Patient,"hi well, I actually awesome lighting so i'm just like."
79.0,Provider,You look good yeah.
4632.0,Patient,"pretty much late now I got I got I. I went home over the weekend. So I am like very i'm just. side note i'm like a very good mood right now I don't know i'm like wait, I might kind of scary bubbly now i'm just kidding but um. I had, I had a bad day yesterday because I i'm. So dumb so I had like class to go to one and I was like okay i'm just gonna like run back to my apartment and get something to eat. So I had a soda and I had it in a bottle and then I like poured I don't even know I forget what I was doing I was rushing a little bit. And then I got distracted because I have these like soda stream bottles and the bottom fell off it and, like broke open, so it was like so busy with that that I didn't realize that I didn't like seal the other bottle and this was the real mistake, I put my computer in the same bag. And my computer. like this computer i'm on my like. i'm on my like this is kind of my play computer it's my mom's computer, but this is my work computer and it's not that bad it's. yeah you. See there's just like water damage."
79.0,Provider,On it's actually not that bad and.
4632.0,Patient,"it's not it's really not, but I just. Still, you know, and I just have this like story I know it's a story, but I have this story of like you know, and I just and I think it's Okay, because I laughed them off and I, and I. You know, but I do these dumb things a lot and I know i'm getting better i'm getting better. yeah I just do a lot of dumb things like we go to the animal facility and I leave my jacket there, and like you know I just do these kind of like fumbling little you know, and I just have a story of like Oh, you know i'm i'm a clots and I like can't. You know I always. have one. Day guessing and. And I really did not feel good um I did. I did binge and purge yesterday, and that was coming off of almost a week that I did not, which was."
79.0,Provider,Nice.
4632.0,Patient,"And it wasn't it wasn't a big one, it was like stuff that i'd had this is a really crazy part that I hadn't been for a while, because I had stuff."
79.0,Provider,To go and run.
4632.0,Patient,"you've been john and I didn't end on it now, I did I did go home Friday night and then I came back Sunday, but you know I, so I had stuff so it wasn't like a big one, you know I kind of wanted to make it bigger but I didn't. um and then I ended up just. I was feeling pretty defeated, so I just. painted for the rest of the night. Nice um. So anyway, I don't know why really so them today so sorry and then today why i'm like oh i'm we have these like secret experiments where like we work in the heart right but. there's this you know I probably mentioned this, that there's this difference between the male and the females."
79.0,Provider,I know that.
4632.0,Patient,"Oh yeah so. So it's a big thing in cardiac research actually that. Like whenever you have these models, where you know you do something, the males have this really crazy phenotype and a lot of the females are just kind of. neutral. So it's kind of interesting because I was doing all this reading about like you know. Like even like hormone replacement therapy, which my mom is on you know i'm talking to her about that, and I think i'm really excited about this part because I think very. cool it's so you know it's still this like you know estrogen replacement is still extremely controversial so anyway."
79.0,Provider,It is controversial.
4632.0,Patient,"it's so controversial and. Millions reading the literature it's like well you know this huge study came out and then everybody was like don't ever take it, and then that study has been like really analyzed and so, but it's you know it's really just a mass and they don't know like. They don't know so anyway so i'm excited about it and. So yeah cuz you're you can really contribute to some of this right yeah. yeah and I do feel like it's. it's like Oh, because it's a woman's problem now I also know that we are a lot more complicated and so it's maybe a little harder to figure things out in in females than men. But also feel like okay it's 2021 and we don't know whether this like really basic thing is good or bad and we've been wondering. For so."
79.0,Provider,yeah what a i'm a simple question. yeah you don't know the answer.
4632.0,Patient,"yeah so so you know so. that's cool yeah so i'm excited about it and then. We just we were doing this experiment today and we were kind of thinking like because these were just kind of secret things that we were doing like we were checking for this. Like the protein that makes like converts the precursor of estrogen into estrogen aromatase I was just like Oh, you know I found that it's in the hearts like maybe we should look at that and she was like okay we're gonna do this can be secret and then."
79.0,Provider,"Oh, I love it."
4632.0,Patient,"I know, and then last week i'm getting hot and. Last week I I was like did you save the uteruses and she was like yeah I did what do you want to do with thumb and I was like Oh, I just want to like you know, I just want to make live States out of them and check for some things and she was like let's let's do it so, then I. got some and and they're going well and I just you know I I I feel. feel like i'm in a very just I don't I I really felt like she yesterday but um. I think I think why I really I really felt like shit was just because I I you know it's that story of like."
79.0,Provider,yeah yeah. yeah challenge that story for me. yeah no I mean. How true is it.
4632.0,Patient,"I think I think it's like. I think what worries me what really scares me about that story is it's like you know it goes quickly into this is the eating disorder, you know this is."
79.0,Provider,The.
4632.0,Patient,"association all out, you know, this is the fallout that you're a little spacey and you don't really you're not like paying attention to things, and you know and. I think you know this kind of idea of myself probably proceeds eating disorder and."
79.0,Provider,cooling tell me tell me more about that.
4632.0,Patient,"I was always kind of a messy kid like I was, I was really smart, but I was just like oh man is."
79.0,Provider,A lot of really smart kids are.
4632.0,Patient,yeah I just.
79.0,Provider,Really really are.
4632.0,Patient,"I was just a mess and I just you know I think i've always just been like you know I can do calculus but I can't do basic basic math like I can do. Things and then I just there's some things that are just very like. And, and I know that since I started doing science like I have improved so much, and I know I will keep you know getting better and i'll keep making these stupid mistakes and then i'll be like okay well i'll not do that again."
79.0,Provider,Such good learning.
4632.0,Patient,"yeah, but I think I do worry that. You know I just. I don't know if it's I mean. If I was. You know, at a bit you know, I think that ideas like well if I was at a bigger weight Would I be somehow not be the person that forgets their jacket in the animal facility like what you know if I really. I don't know if I. yeah."
79.0,Provider,you're not you're looking for a reason in that realm for that that's interesting.
4632.0,Patient,yeah and maybe that's you know it's it's. it's. too simple um but.
79.0,Provider,"yeah I do think because i've seen it in too many people, including myself, that you transition out of that. Your life is very much. In such a state of flux and has been for quite a few years. yeah, and I mean almost growing up that's almost the definition you're constantly trying to. navigate where you're at. You know where anyway it's just such a process, so I used to be the person that lost their keys couple times a week. never lose my keys."
4632.0,Patient,I know. I never what makes you feel that.
79.0,Provider,"I have places for them like. My life is like. Pretty predictable and like. yeah you know i'm not switching classes and. yeah and I really do think part of it is just you're so maturing I mean that you probably like. Well, I am but other people are done."
4632.0,Patient,yeah exactly.
79.0,Provider,"it's really not true you're still. Everybody generally in their 20s is still maturing emotionally, especially if you had something traumatic happen. yeah and that has to do with a lot of that tracking things having your mind be present in this space. Rather than fast forwarding are. You going back and so."
4632.0,Patient,"No that's I mean, because I, you know I do think it is like it's not so much well i'm not the person that forgets their keys i'm the person that just like has made it so that that's where they put their kids and i've made it so that I do these things um. But yeah I mean, I had a therapist one time telling me that I was like emotionally three years old, which I was like what is that. I know I love her she's great, but I was so funny you're choosing. Intellectually you're 30 but. you're mostly three years old."
79.0,Provider,And you could invite their I mean and disorders do. yeah halt emotional maturity somehow I don't even know how that works I should study that sometime.
4632.0,Patient,"Well, and I think you're I think it's true, though, that, like. You know I I have never really. wanted or needed to. Be you know be somebody who's on top of every little thing because. I can typically you know I don't know I mean i've been able to write like with science it's like every single little details like you can't one thing you can do one thing."
79.0,Provider,"can be exactly and you do that, over and over again, exactly right."
4632.0,Patient,yeah i've.
79.0,Provider,done blow your mind about yourself.
4632.0,Patient,"I mean i'm getting there I, I know that, like i'm get i'm getting closer to that place and. But yeah I mean I I do, I do think that I will. I will grow up, I mean I see people my age and they're just like you know. They just have it all together, I guess."
79.0,Provider,"really is, you know that many."
4632.0,Patient,"I don't know if i'm on your age when I say. When I say that I mean like. They can they know like 74 different experiments, you know and then they're like oh yeah well we use my lap and i'm like who I what."
79.0,Provider,"they're definitely yeah that's their kind of the exception, I wouldn't. But. yeah and one thing that I do like to tell myself sometimes it's a military saying. is slow, is fast. i'll just go explore as fast so."
4632.0,Patient,Oh that's kind of a yeah.
79.0,Provider,"carefully because and that's what they do like, especially the special forces, you know they have to you can't risk having to do it twice, you have to do it right, the first time, so do it slowly until you know yeah it's just kind of a almost a muscle memory. yeah and that's true muscle memory like when I go to hang my keys up muscle memory. Like yeah dig in my purse."
4632.0,Patient,yeah and I know that. yeah so anyway um.
79.0,Provider,keep going tell me.
4632.0,Patient,"yeah I want to hear your like 25 recall like what are you eating these days. So okay so um. This is okay. Since we last spoke sorry, this is not I can't give you my 24 hour recall but. I just do this. mm hmm um so I after our meeting I like signed up for imperfect foods, I have not spoken. spoken to my parents about it, I meant to it's not that i'm like. I think I may be a part of me is still avoiding it a little bit just because I don't want to be like hey you're still paying for that you know i'm sure they know I. Nothing passes my step dad's bank account without him being fully aware that it's happening when he gets a vacation my mom was the target like i'm sure he knows, but. there's only, as I said, i'll bring it up. But i've been looking at imperfect foods, and I think it really looks so perfect and I really need to switch over because, like they have they have salmon."
79.0,Provider,"Oh lovely. And it comes with. Like dry ice, or what."
4632.0,Patient,yeah i'm i'm assuming.
79.0,Provider,behind its own packet.
4632.0,Patient,"yeah i'm assuming they do something similar to. Hello fresh, which is like it comes in a box that has a thing you know it's got this like material that keeps cold in um and then some and I signed I just clicked the like so for two weeks now. i've just like looked at what's available and then i've skipped it."
79.0,Provider,yeah to see.
4632.0,Patient,"Just to see. And I clicked the meat and fish pack, because I can just get rid of any of the chicken or whatever other products they I think it does really perfect, so I need to I need to do this, I am just saying this because I mean it's cheaper to I think it's like it's like. read it as a week 40 and and Hello fresh is a lot of money um. So I have had, I had the same meal twice for lunch and dinner today um which was so I was a little scared um this meal was like shrimp. Some sort of pasta and i'm still i've done some like ravioli no keys, for some reason I don't really know why but i've had success with that um, and this was a penny and I don't know that freaked me out a little bit. rice. And then i've been really into. I forgot because i've been doing broccoli for a long time that's like when I go to the store that's the vegetable I get and then I roast it, but I forgot how much I loved cauliflower because usually, when i'm shopping i'm like okay $2 $4. um."
79.0,Provider,yeah.
4632.0,Patient,"But then I was like wait a minute I just thought it was I forgot, I thought it was white broccoli and then I had it and I was like this is not like broccoli this. Is this is a totally different. Animal is this. it's it's my favorite of. So that I had that, for I made that last night and I had for lunch and dinner um."
79.0,Provider,And it still had the rice with it.
4632.0,Patient,"Yes, well, they were all in their own. Making them all in their own compartments. yeah and i'm I need to go shopping I should have done that today I just. shop in i'm not not really um. But i'd like to get some more things I mean. yeah no. i'm. Like I don't know what i'm going to do for tomorrow. I guess i'll just. have to cook during anyway um. I mean i'd love i'd like to have. More than just my Hello fresh meals, I think that would be the real good thing about doing imperfect foods. yeah."
79.0,Provider,And I love that you're like ready this you know. yeah is it. cool next step.
4632.0,Patient,"How you definitely am and you know, like so Danny the boy was one of his roommates does Hello fresh and he's like Oh, did you make the same meal and i'm like I don't make their meals stop doing that I don't do that anymore."
79.0,Provider,I mean I progressed.
4632.0,Patient,"I just like I say all the spices and then, when I have something i'm like. Oh okay we're going to do this spice you know I."
79.0,Provider,felt great.
4632.0,Patient,um sorry my dad is texting me why.
79.0,Provider,yeah no worries and what what I love about that is that's exactly the hope that you had with Hello fresh.
4632.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
79.0,Provider,"Things don't always work out that way. No, but it really did."
4632.0,Patient,"Well, and and. I really am like. I want to. Be somebody that and I started to be this i'd like to be is that fuller capacity somebody who has a lot of things that they've made in their fridge you know not you know, not so much that they can't go through it, but just like some options."
79.0,Provider,Like three options or something.
4632.0,Patient,"yeah you know, like maybe like one protein than like couple grains and. me yes."
79.0,Provider,"You know, like, I want to add together and spice it. yeah and, if you want. to wear yeah."
4632.0,Patient,"Like i'm home, I can just like do that and then. And then I have been noticing as well that. I have this tendency, I have a tendency and treatments, who, and I think i've been I do it sometimes, and I think it's it was really good when I first started to eating on my own. i'm of eating very slowly, you know, having something to distract me really take my time and I think now i'm like okay let's you know it's a little bit more no i've talked about this many times and I think I know your times when it is good to. You know Take your time with it, and a lot of times like when I come home from work I typically just like i'm like I need to do this, so I can keep doing my work."
79.0,Provider,Right it's kind of as you've got time pressure.
4632.0,Patient,yeah.
79.0,Provider,And that's super normal.
4632.0,Patient,"It was interesting. What Sunday night I we went out to. You know, we were Danny was away for a little bit so he was like oh i'm gonna take you out for dinner, and so like he had all these places that he wanted to go to, of course, like we go to one it's like. You know we're not going to get a seat there and then we just like let's just go to this place and it like it's one of those places where I was like. It looked it looked Nice, the menu was kind of. It seemed optimistic right like it was just all these like you know almost too much like sugars seracini glaze you know. I don't I don't know about you guys like and it wasn't good."
79.0,Provider,not good.
4632.0,Patient,It was like my first like. Bad bad meal.
79.0,Provider,"I have these creative with words but not so much in the kitchen, you know and i'm really kinda like all right, I just have to eat this food, but like. yeah way to make them. yeah but I don't know is."
4632.0,Patient,"You know, I was like wow I couldn't cook something that is said, and probably would have been cheaper, it would have been definitely a lot cheaper."
79.0,Provider,i'm i'm sure. And did is he gone away to with a DC.
4632.0,Patient,"Yes, so i'm on that um so when did I, yes, so we had two conversations since. You know, last week I was kind of like ra it's really bugging me I need to know a little bit. Decision yeah. yeah and so. I don't know what it is about like I think, maybe I talked to him I don't know but um when we had that conversation. He kind of said, like I I probably will is very likely, I will move to DC it's just a question of like when i'm. and You know, I was I said out loud and once I said it out loud, I was like oh that that is actually really, what I want was I said, you know I want stability."
79.0,Provider,Alright cool I love that up.
4632.0,Patient,"I know I said, you did. yeah that's exactly what I want."
79.0,Provider,That can ruin that.
4632.0,Patient,"yeah I was like, and so you know I. I think my my my opinions have changed a little bit, but like when we first had this conversation because I had just seen my friend Sophie the weekend before and i'm like. You know I am I am I have got a lot going on and and i'd like to see him multiple times a week, but you know."
79.0,Provider,reality of it.
4632.0,Patient,"yeah yeah and so, so I was kind of like well you know if he moved to DC which for you out there you it's like a 4040 minute drive."
79.0,Provider,"Okay, so what's traffic."
4632.0,Patient,"yeah. It yeah it's not bad, like most people when I tell people is they're like that's not far and i'm like, for me it is I don't. yeah so so I just kind of said to him, like you know I don't think that's gonna work for me, and so, then I kind of had to reflect a little bit because he was like. You know I think this is well you know, I was really kind of like Oh well, if he stays it's for his mom or it's for his friends and I said that he was like well the drive to my mom is he is pretty much equidistant. baltimore DC. hmm I have a lot of friends in DC the reason i'm saying here, the reason i'm not in DC right now is because of you. Oh well, I know, but."
79.0,Provider,he's being congruent to.
4632.0,Patient,"yeah you know it's pretty and and so. And I said, you know here's the thing I wouldn't let anybody get in the way of my career, you know. If this is what you. want to do and needs to do it, but I also don't think he's you know he's anyway i'm like what going way to. end in a spot yeah essentially um you know I said. um. I had to think about if he was to delay. For like let's say six months, what I want to break up now. To save myself the heartache later."
79.0,Provider,Oh interesting yeah.
4632.0,Patient,"Or what I want to because I want my. Last like serious relationship that I kind of got burned by like pretending things aren't really like happening um. And then. This was my he was a marine use us as Alex and and it just really, really like hurt now, I think. I think i've changed a little bit because DC he was moving to Japan so it's a little bit different."
79.0,Provider,A lot different to DC yeah now.
4632.0,Patient,"yeah um so I said, you know I think I think for me like you know i'm also thinking about like well, am I going to be more stable and six months than I am now probably."
79.0,Provider,"Oh, you know 100% agree."
4632.0,Patient,"And, and so, like, I think, for right now probably really destabilized me if I were to just stop seeing this guy that had become kind of a pretty consistent part of my life for a while now um. So I think I i'm we I asked him again last night because I still don't really know whether or not he was moving in December, I still kind of thought that was an open question, he was like i'm not moving in December. I don't know when i'll start, but like you'll know if I make any decisions, so I think it's at least like delayed to like March."
79.0,Provider,Oh yeah. And that yeah.
4632.0,Patient,"You find. plenty of time, so now i'm like okay i'm just gonna like, and I think when that does approach he's still like you know, depending on where I live, and i'm like yeah I mean depending on where you live like it might not be a 40 hour 4040 minute."
79.0,Provider,True.
4632.0,Patient,And if he's willing to drive to me that also makes a difference. yeah if he's working from home some of the days that makes it it.
79.0,Provider,"Oh, it totally makes me, you know there's like all these things were on."
4632.0,Patient,"All right, wait a minute, this is really not. It you know, I think, I think, even if he did move in the future it's definitely not a deal breaker but we'll see me."
79.0,Provider,"yeah no nice work, though, it shows a ton of emotional maturity."
4632.0,Patient,"yeah well. And I think um. I also had I i'm feeling very I also have this other thing sorry not to talk about relationships, but I also had like um. The other thing happened with this like friend group I was trying to get into so. Okay i'm sorry this I definitely do not, but it goes to a point that i'm trying to make right now. Which is um so I saw my friends Sophie two weeks ago and then my friend Gus who i've definitely mentioned many times. And he lives in baltimore so if he lives in DC Gus lives in baltimore and I met these friends through Gus and then I find out goss's moving away and last time I talked to Sophie she's going to move to New York."
79.0,Provider,it's just a matter oh wow.
4632.0,Patient,"Long from now, which. I should have seen this coming she's from outside of New York, I know she thinks it's like you know that it's like the best city in the world to her. You know her. And so, she was kind of like I have to live in another city, before I like when and I was like."
79.0,Provider,Totally and whereas guess going.
4632.0,Patient,"So Gus moved to Virginia he, like move he just moved he just moved, you know he's just like Oh, I did."
79.0,Provider,What I know i've got that just sounds right on point.
4632.0,Patient,"Exactly that's got so um which is not that far and his girlfriend still in baltimore so you'll be here all the time, so anyway, so I had this like falling out kind of where I went to hang out with his friends from our sister campus in Santa fe. And we kind of got into a little tip at the end of the night and I left and a half, because of some political stuff that I. don't need to get into. And I was kind of like oh shit one of my friend love to have my friends, leaving you know, like. yeah I need to new goddamn friends, I need some friends, I like these guys, we now know something that we will never discussed ever again."
79.0,Provider,True so.
4632.0,Patient,"I am. We have fun i'm. awesome so I did see them last week because Gus was like i'm in town, so I was, like all right it's Thursday night I work in the morning but i'm going to go. I."
79.0,Provider,"saw you saw them after the tip I saw them after the test and it had been led to the stick yeah peaks and I was like I feel really weird about this, I want to be their friends um."
4632.0,Patient,"And so goddess was like oh i'm around and then I was, and then I like couldn't hang out with them on Wednesday, and then I was, like all right, I need to just go out and I need to just. Repair things and just yeah so. Point being you know I feel like I do have a lot of really good things in my life, right now, I have a lot of. yeah um it's very full and um. yeah I mean, I just want to be. You know. I don't know really. I mean I. I think it also It makes me think with how like busy i've been as well that, like. I think. One if I if I really look at this is like i'm moving around a lot like I need to be eating more probably than I. and You know. Having all these things and places to go I think it's it's opportunity to eat out and also, if I need to go out and i'm not if i'm going to be out for a while, well, I need to eat, you know I mean."
79.0,Provider,yeah prepare have a plan yeah.
4632.0,Patient,"yeah and I bring i'll bring a snack usually, when i'm hanging out with them, because they go late. um so I. I get some cheese it's and it's kind of like now it's my little like blam because."
79.0,Provider,Jesus.
4632.0,Patient,"And they're like who is this girl, why does she eat so many cheese it's."
79.0,Provider,Such a great cracker.
4632.0,Patient,they're great I love. I love Jesus but anyway um. yeah I mean.
79.0,Provider,yeah I mean what I love about what you described is that it's not like things perfectly fell into place these are things where you had definite hiccups.
4632.0,Patient,And problems.
79.0,Provider,Oh yeah and you work through it.
4632.0,Patient,Well yeah.
79.0,Provider,"That engender so much trust in yourself and trusting in possible relationships and that it's not some sudden do or die, you know."
4632.0,Patient,"No you're right. I mean. I have, I have. been really. i've been really trying and i'm and i'm still really like you know even right now with school and everything like. Like I did all this work on the weekend, and you know I go hang out I go hang out the boy and i'm like Oh, when you go to bed i'll do some work and then I was like work, you know I like."
79.0,Provider,I love.
4632.0,Patient,"My final exam is in my final exam was in like. 1015 days. And i'm already studying like i'm already you know and i'm doing like. Like I don't I really don't need to be as crazy, you know, be this crazy like school all the time. Work all the time. I have time to to. And well yeah and and and you know this, this is it is really important to me, I think one of the things I realized, because I ended up staying out pretty late on Thursday night. But I realized, you know, like Danny was like, why do you stay out so late and i'm like because being fun is very important part I think of my identity, you know. That is just something that is really important to me and I, and I will. I will spend time because that's anyway, I don't know so to food."
79.0,Provider,"yeah you know, unless I do want to go to the food, especially when you say I think I need to eat more i'm like oh. Well let's do it where can you, you know increase a little bit."
4632.0,Patient,"um. I mean, I think. snacks. and I think well. Oh, this is hard, I think, with snacks that's that's one because I tend to gravitate towards. The lower calorie snacks which, like when you really crack it up, you know it's like it's really not that much of a difference, I mean it can be like quantity verse. You know, quality I don't know I mean, I think."
79.0,Provider,"yeah it's so true, though, like whether it's 150 calorie snack 190 like really."
4632.0,Patient,"yeah what's the what's the difference yeah exactly yeah. So I feel like that is just one way I can push myself like I usually get I get regular cheese it's all because they have like cracked cracker cheese. And i'll get those sometimes but i'll get regular cheese it's in a in a in a little bag, but I don't buy them in a box like I don't buy a lot of these things. in larger quantities. um I think that would be one thing like. To do um. and yeah I mean I think that's that's one thing I mean i'd like to. i'd like to. have some sort of sweet things I think that's still really scary like I don't know if I can just. um I don't know if I can do ice cream, I was just thinking like a popsicle."
79.0,Provider,"Actually, I was thinking 99. Or, like the little individual like I know things mo cheese. yeah or you know something that really feels already portion. yeah and having you know, a box of six or something like that."
4632.0,Patient,yeah and typically that stuff's expensive too so it's like.
79.0,Provider,It is it's not really a.
4632.0,Patient,"Great food. Okay, I yeah I like I like that um. Because. Sometimes I want some Oh, I think another I still haven't done this, I solvent done i'm. Like. cream and sugar in my coffee because i've been having Timor, and that is another way where it's just like you know just go a little bit more in there. I like. I like a warm team that doesn't really make sense of the popsicle but I don't know, sometimes I mean it's getting kind of I don't know what's kind of."
79.0,Provider,Even on a winter night sometimes a popsicle or ice cream sounds good.
4632.0,Patient,yeah true um yeah I don't know what other. I think um it would be interesting to for me to try chocolate.
79.0,Provider,let's have some hand.
4632.0,Patient,yeah because I think. I think weirdly enough. I don't really like chocolate.
79.0,Provider,doesn't surprise me at all.
4632.0,Patient,yeah I think I don't like it. And I you know it's like it's something i've like been shown in the past it doesn't I don't tend to binge on it anymore I. don't think i'm. But it would be interesting to like have you know some chocolate and be like. How do I really feel about this.
79.0,Provider,"i'd love for you to have like a sharing bag. yeah m&ms or something. And yeah like something that I, you know have something to close it up with like a little. yeah paper clip or something you know, like i'm gonna have a few you know. yeah whatever and it's true eating a whole bag of m&ms oh that. they're not fun like on your mouth. Like overwhelming texture. yeah it's that just kind of makes me gag. yeah got it."
4632.0,Patient,"yeah. No, I yeah I mean, I think that would be interesting, too, because that you know, maybe I do like chocolate, but every time i'm eating every time I tend to eat it I eat it and he's like wait."
79.0,Provider,yeah and your mouth is like oh.
4632.0,Patient,"No, this is way too much."
79.0,Provider,Oh that's such a good point I love.

4632.0,Patient,"yeah it's pretty late, and I do, I mean it's it's it's dangerous around here. I like i've started going um when I go over to danny's place and he has like a grocery store near him he lives in a lot safer of a neighborhood. So I can go there late. i've even gone with him that was kind of fun."
79.0,Provider,mmm hmm that's awesome grocery shopping with them.

4632.0,Patient,"It was well, it was this sorry yeah no I definitely like a local. was like a small grocery store. Okay, this is kind of wacky I don't know my. name is i'm looking. weird. All right, i'm sorry I don't know where my my check hasn't cash I have money, I have money oh that's the."
79.0,Provider,Other thing is you got your money. I got paid.
4632.0,Patient,"I got the. Money i've been like buying I it was funny I went home and I went shopping with my mom and I was like i'm gonna buy something really nice I get there, I like trying all these nice things then then i'm like. i'm really just going to buy these pants you know because i'm i'm spending my money and i'm like that's. awesome none of these are really I bought these pants that I I love them i'm gonna wear them all the work. You know they're comfy their. Rates they're just there like and I was like I will spend you know so that's. that's fun I have money now. So I can go to the grocery store and get some nicer things and do the experiment where. You know. Do I like this um but I mean it's just tricky honestly on a day that. When katia isn't in when she doesn't come into work, everybody leaves at like four o'clock. So if. That happens I know and i'm always like I never know when she's not going to come in, so that, of course, is the day that i'm like there till 530 you know that's. Like i'm like yeah somebody give me a heads up um."
79.0,Provider,How do they all know.
4632.0,Patient,"I yeah they're all yeah somehow we make it so I don't know I don't know so. And she wasn't in today so maybe it's but she might be like busy so she might not come I don't know I don't. But regardless that I need to do that i'm Okay, but I have eggs, I have, I have. The things in my. I still have English muffins. Oh, and I, and I have, I do. Have. ramen. And I need to. I think I need to find something fun to do with that um."

4632.0,Patient,um. yeah.
79.0,Provider,"yeah what are you thinking as far as making the meals, a little more substantial."
4632.0,Patient,"um. I mean, I feel like it's really just what i've been doing more is. Is fat. that's."
79.0,Provider,Nice.
4632.0,Patient,"But I think honestly like. I think I am oh one thing i've been. I don't know why but it's really surprised me recently i've had extremely regular bowel movements like kind of I know i'm like. I don't know I just was like wow Is this how much like I don't know it's felt weird to the past couple of days or I don't know I don't know why it really been more but maybe i'm just paying attention more like. I don't know, so I think that's good sign."
79.0,Provider,And it's.
4632.0,Patient,"But I think you know I could be. I could I you know tend to portion smaller and then i'll go back and because I have to heat everything up. You know even using oh I started listening to this podcast I think you'd be happy with me, I actually kind of recommend it's kind of interesting."
79.0,Provider,And that's.
4632.0,Patient,called maintenance phase.
79.0,Provider,Very cool.
4632.0,Patient,"So it's it's a podcast I really liked it's called that's called you're wrong about, but they did this kind of spin off where they're talking about diet fads which is you know it's a double edged thing but there's one coho is a larger woman. And so they're talking about all these. fad diets and, like the one I was just listening to his own like Fen Fen."
79.0,Provider,uh huh.
4632.0,Patient,And like just all this crazy like this killed people and.
79.0,Provider,And people are still taking it.
4632.0,Patient,yeah and and just you know and so it's kind of it's it's kind of interesting I don't Why did I bring that up.
79.0,Provider,i'm just that. You were just saying it was this good blog post about the or the. podcast about maintenance phase.
4632.0,Patient,yeah.
79.0,Provider,I don't I think it was just your. substantiating your food a little more with hats.
4632.0,Patient,"yeah I yeah I don't remember why tie that in there was some reason I brought it up, but. there's something I don't know it doesn't really matter um. Oh sorry I remember now um. One of the things they were talking about was they were talking about this one guy who had all these like fake recommendations, but one of them was like eat on smaller plates that apparently there were these studies of like Oh, if you eat on. And they were kind of saying the guy was full of shit but, for me, I was kind of like will do I do, that is, that something I tend to do a eat on a smaller plate, because it makes me feel safer, you know versus over portion and then just. Seeing where I go. yeah I did, that the other day, where I like I ate like more out of the container."
79.0,Provider,Where I didn't like.
4632.0,Patient,"Really portion and I ended up eating at all um and that's fine but that's you know, like if I didn't do that. I wouldn't have so I feel like I. I think. I should probably. try to do that a little bit um I tend to eat everything out of bowls so I don't know if that makes a difference, I don't think that as anything to do with anything but."
79.0,Provider,And you might just like the edge of it because yeah. There it is kind of nice to have a bowl you have an edge to work against.
4632.0,Patient,"yeah and and I got these nice balls we have these neighbors and she's got all this, you know they're beautiful."
79.0,Provider,"they're beautiful, of course."
4632.0,Patient,"Trying to do yeah I love that you have. yeah well what am I gonna do what am I going to do by some target plates like I have these beautiful and cheekbones like. What amazing yeah. yeah, but I can you know, I think that that is something me to play around with as well, because when I don't have. You know. What I have food in front of me I definitely eat more right like when i'm eating dinner with my parents, I definitely more I go back for seconds I always go back for seconds, you know. Because I don't who will you know. You know, and I don't really do that when i'm on my own, so I think. I think that would that make a difference."
79.0,Provider,"mm hmm it it's a really, really cool thing when I see clients or hear stories of people where they get past that fear that if I eat more my body is going to blow up. yeah and they they realize well actually my body is going to be what's going to be. yeah you know there's you can fluctuate in what you eat and your body's like i'm staying here like this is this good good for us."
4632.0,Patient,"Well, and I also feel like I mean, I know that to be true, but I think it's even more true right now, where you know i'm not athletic I will never be athletic I will never willingly want I you know i'm kind of convinced that. was just funny because i'm just stating a runner and i'm like."
79.0,Provider,"Oh, he hasn't runner."
4632.0,Patient,"I don't think I know that yeah and i'm like. I don't want to you know, like I know there's also this like oh I can't because i've had a problem with in the past but. I don't want I get."
79.0,Provider,I don't know talk with that yeah I.
4632.0,Patient,"don't do, but the nature of my work is kind of physical."
79.0,Provider,"Oh, very much so you're. not walking and walking."
4632.0,Patient,"there's no many jobs where you're like on your feet. moving around like you know yeah like right it's, I guess, maybe like a like a like being a doctor or like a nurse or something where it's like."
79.0,Provider,back and forth by birth yeah.
4632.0,Patient,"yeah so I feel like I do get. Probably you know, a recommended amount of daily exercise."
