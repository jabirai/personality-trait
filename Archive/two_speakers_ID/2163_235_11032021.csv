2163.0,Patient,yeah yeah. yeah. That was nice.
235.0,Provider,So what's the game plan you're going to go on the boat here pretty soon or.
2163.0,Patient,"Actually, I might not I had to have a talk with the captain last night we did. spend all day doing all the crab gear yesterday and then. Had a conference call with the owners of the motel that i'm painting. And then got another call from the owner of another house i'm doing and. there's just too many deadlines that have to be met, so I had to tell the captain that I had to step down for now and. he's just fundamental enough."
235.0,Provider,"yeah probably feels a little odd not being out there on the water. You know, during the season, or something for you, but it's a good move you don't want to stretch yourself too thin you know get you know."
2163.0,Patient,yeah.
235.0,Provider,that's not that's not a good place to be but.
2163.0,Patient,yeah it's getting really stressed out this last week.
235.0,Provider,"yeah there's a bill that on group. The other day with you know kind of meet the deadlines and stuff like that, and just kind of a lot of work to get going. yeah yeah."
2163.0,Patient,yeah this. kierston reminded me that all these. quitting out on all these paintings jobs are risking you know not finishing them that's too much guaranteed money to pass up on to take the chance on going fishing so.
235.0,Provider,"yeah that makes sense. yeah no the painting jobs are guaranteed, where the fishing, and you know. You think you would bounce back and be pretty good this year, but you know it's still a kind of a crap shot I guess."
2163.0,Patient,"it's supposed to be better everybody's saying, but you never know. i'm sure you'll be back at it next year, hopefully, you know. Well, I told I still might be scared baby that if everything gets fun get everything done this month, then. Then I can get back on if there's a spot open."
235.0,Provider,"yeah because I think, in a sense also your your fisherman so being on the water, I mean it's a lot of work, but at the same time it's probably gives you a lot of peace out there to you know being out there in the ocean."
2163.0,Patient,yeah I really enjoy it yeah.
235.0,Provider,"yeah I remember when I was in the navy and we go on exercise out, and you know she was is pretty cool even when the water was rough and we were I was on. Old LSD converted a GP those were the flat bottom ships that during wwe to Korean War they opened up in the front and then jeeps and tanks and stuff came, you know came off on like a landing ship. And we're sealed up and we became a big machine shop. For like patrol gumbo tenders and destroyers and bird farms that came in and needed stuff done, but it was cool we went out in the Mediterranean, we go. We go to Spain and Morocco and places like that, and you get rough water in this flat bottom boats, you could just imagine you know, like you're 45 degrees, I never got sick dumb and it was just like it kind of rocked me to sleep. Right yeah so. might be led by dad was in the navy school. But i'm thinking, if you want we'll go quarterly does that sound like a winner."

You know it's if people are moving from southern California up your ways just to get out of the traffic, and you know way from the craziness.
