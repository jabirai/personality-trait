ID,Role,Message
9831.0,Patient,What.
480.0,Provider,"Like 1030 and it just kept saying it was connecting for like five minutes, and so I sent you a message i'm like i'm going to close it out and reopen the room and see if that's better."
9831.0,Patient,Good.
480.0,Provider,How are you.
9831.0,Patient,today.
480.0,Provider,Oh no.
9831.0,Patient,"I don't know yeah. I don't like it yeah I don't hear me. Thanks I like it, I kind of get freaked out every time I see myself, do you like a."
480.0,Provider,"sunny so okay in group you caught us up to speed on the whole, your co parenting but you're not in a relationship anymore."
9831.0,Patient,yeah.
480.0,Provider,"That still going Okay, it sounds like you guys went to like a counselor to talk about it."
9831.0,Patient,"No, I just talk about that stuff all the time. yeah. yeah no just me talking about stuff all the time. And yeah where we have huskies, and I mean I get I feel like I get tired of them because i'm home during the day and I work from home, but obviously the huskies are here. And it's just like especially hard right now, because they can't leave the House because they haven't met all of our thoughts and so when they get all their shots I know it's going to be better for both of us like meaning me and the huskies. Because I have not been going outside either."
480.0,Provider,Oh no.
9831.0,Patient,yeah.
480.0,Provider,"kind of and depressive episode, or is it more just circumstantial at this point."
9831.0,Patient,"I feel like it was definitely a depressive episode, and I might like be coming out of it soon, but. It does feel like a depressive episode, and I think a lot of the stuff that's happened happening this year has been definitely like situational like it's making me worse, but you know. I think i'm definitely like like this, like all the time, because you know, even when things are like you know for like objectively like they're going well, like things are getting better you know. But i'm still just like it's never it's never enough it's never satisfying it just doesn't it doesn't hit like it doesn't I don't know."
480.0,Provider,"Okay, and so, for that, when you say it's never a satisfying is that because it doesn't feel like how you feel when you're in more of a manic episode."
9831.0,Patient,Of course yeah yeah.
480.0,Provider,"yeah so that's, the problem is it's like there's no baseline of normalcy. So then, when you're not. Even the normals probably going to feel. Low to you, you know."
9831.0,Patient,"yeah yeah so it's very streaming so yeah that's what I tell people to. yeah i'm like telling myself also but my new thing that i'm saying is like like a self talk thing is um something my grandma told me, the other day on the phone she called me and whatever. But she was like how are you doing, and I mean she knows you know, so you know and it's like that's it's like a heavy question. And so it's like a couple seconds, you know, and then I like say something, and we almost say something like at the same time and she's like. me he that life is hard and then, just like you my face in and i'm like i'm good mom but no there's like a little delay because you know we can both tell like i'm thinking of like what to say and like what do I actually want to say. And then she says like I said she's like life is hard like I don't know what you're going to say, but I just got to remind you, life is hard and and then i'm like yeah i'm doing good honestly. Things are good, you know and she's like good life is hard, but you know i'm glad that you're doing good. And she asked me about my dogs, which was cool because I think you know I mean obviously she thinks i'm ridiculous for having them because he's told me before, because I have a dog already and to like lives in my grandma's house."
480.0,Provider,So you know the two. guys are like second and third dog.
9831.0,Patient,"yeah so it's like very responsible that I got a dog another two dogs. But you know molly is with Sophia and that's my grandma's dog and they like keep each other company they're the same age, they grew up together. And so, everyone knows that, like Sophie a will be lonely without molly there and then nowadays, for the last at least two weeks, maybe three weeks now almost or something yeah for sure, like three weeks. molly is at my mother's house on my grandmother's House and my mother has a dog. And he's all by himself too and he's been getting in trouble, because he writes small dogs. As Social know so they get along, but like he's been escaping the House. Like the gate was left open because her partner like. took the trash cans out and like I wasn't close or whatever, and so he got out and he had another small dog like he just like the small small ones like the little toy like you know, like little dogs. And even dogs that I call them like fake dogs, you know. Because they're just a small they're not like real dog. So, like pugs or like to wallet or like whatever. Although scraggly little nz you find that, like the pound and stuff but Nino heat is I don't know what it is, but he didn't have any socialization for a long time, he was the dog from Mexico and so he guarded the House and then my mom. Paid like a bunch of money to get in paperwork and vaccines and they shipped him to and she airplane and him to take wanna and then drove down."
480.0,Provider,Oh wow.
9831.0,Patient,"And then pick them up and yeah so I mean he lives here now, for years, and so he's like a really good buddy he says so he he doesn't even shred up his toys. Like he doesn't even shred them he just plays with them, he doesn't even shred them, but he attacks small dogs, so this is like the fourth one. So yeah so like my mom doesn't walk them at the daytime but he escaped obviously and. He attacked a dog. and luckily nothing terrible happened, I mean the neighbors did called animal services and they came like a week later and they're like well. He we need proof that he has a rabies shot and then molly was there at that point, and so they're like wait there's another dog Okay, we need to prove that they have a rabies shot on their license with the city. But it's good now because. You know. Now she's keeping West so company and they've lived together before. Okay, I also. Like when I went to London, so they they get along and uh yeah they're going to get their paperwork and stuff my mom told me to email. I have an email or because I called her veterinarian. And they said they would email me the paper work, but I didn't get it."
480.0,Provider,She does need a new shot it's been a year.
9831.0,Patient,"So that's. All fine you know what I mean, and so, like my point is molly's fine, but the fact that I have a dog or any like I should be you know getting my. Life together and like taking care of my responsibilities that I already have instead of you know, signing myself for new ridiculous loans with some person I. moved in with randomly. Seemingly you know what I mean."
480.0,Provider,"yeah so and that's the that's the thing, though, is it doesn't it's not very useful to punish yourself for. Decisions you already made. Right so like. And yeah i'm thinking about the fact like oh that was irresponsible I probably shouldn't have done that that's not useful at all, you did it, and now you just. have to. Look at day to day. How am I going to. make this work in the best way."
9831.0,Patient,Possible you know.
480.0,Provider,"Because that's part of the issue is if you're constantly regretting choices, you made then it's going to carry over into today's decisions, too. So. yeah and, at the time, like you did think through it, it wasn't entirely impulsive. Like. You know, you were in a different state of mind, but you also did think it through. i'm here, you talk to me before you even got the dogs and you were thinking about getting the dogs and."
9831.0,Patient,"I don't know the moving in I don't remember how quick that was, but like yeah you."
480.0,Provider,"You did put some thought into it, so you have to remind yourself that. It wasn't. Irresponsible or impulsive it was a thought through a decision that just happened to not work out because you had no way of knowing if that relationship was going to work out or not. yeah and you wouldn't feel you're. Responsible if the relationship was still going."
9831.0,Patient,"yeah I mean also there are a lot of work, and I am like really tired of them, so I feel kind of like guilty that it's kind of like I tell doors like. I feel like a new mom and they've just like hate their lives, you know, and then they feel guilty for not being a great mom when it's exhausting and it's like it makes sense because they're just they're not like molly at all. yeah like molly listen huskies don't listen."
480.0,Provider,"huskies are too smart that's, the problem is."
9831.0,Patient,They are.
480.0,Provider,To be trained because they're way too smart.
9831.0,Patient,"yeah those are I was telling him yesterday he got home from work and stuff and he was like playing with them, and I was sitting on the couch and I was, and he, like. He tried to pass me the ball to play with them, and I was like. i'm too tired I can't play with them and then I started crying cuz I was just like obviously like the most phone a lot like I mean other stuff but whatever I started crying and he was like what's up. And I was like Wednesday such a beautiful dog, and I feel like i'm just need to her all day I just like yeah let her to get her to like her, training and. For her to behave and I feel like what i'm just like yelling at her and mean all day and like it's just frustrating to Wednesday and me. You know, like this, all day we're just kind of like frustrated and anxious and just sad because i'm just like training them all day and I just feel like i'm just yelling at them all day and then, when you get home I. retired I can't like I don't want to have fun with them like i'm just exhausted like and I don't know I feel like irresponsible sometimes if I don't train them while i'm at home, but it's like I don't know it's really hard for me to find like a right balance."
480.0,Provider,"yeah and that's The thing is, you are now very. Well, exposed and. experienced in parenting because that is exactly a parenting in a nutshell right it's like you're you're spending all this time and energy and constantly feeling guilty, because you have to. set rules hold boundaries. Give consequent yeah but then you feel guilty because. You want to be the lifespan parent and if you need to be the Nice fun parent you're not actually parenting the way you're supposed to so. it's a hard balance and it's okay to feel opposing emotions, at the same time, you can feel grateful that you have these dogs and also exhausted and pissed that you have to take care of them. Like it doesn't have to go."
9831.0,Patient,"yeah so yeah I myself about that you know I I do like them, I you know, and so I just remind myself things are going to get better for both of us. When they can go outside, because then i'm going to go outside again and you're going to run around and get all your get all your you know energy out the way supposed to and not be frustrated enough. Exactly how long. You been. Oh, my God now next week it's been like three months, been ridiculous, I mean it's been like two months and half. We got them, I think, July. 16 or something July 15. So yeah honestly it's been too full months I guess. i'm. By the 22nd they'll have their shop that they can go out afterwards, so that weekend i'm going to meet my via who has to husky and then we're finally going to hang out and meet for the first time, so yeah."
480.0,Provider,You have. A large area.
9831.0,Patient,"No, I don't know we were talking about that the other day, and I was like what is a dog Park, you know, technically, because I mean I guess there's parks and dogs are like not banned, but they have to be only I feel like a dog park is. where you can let them also. yeah and I have very strong opinions about letting them off leash along with the mouth, please."
480.0,Provider,Probably they're. Like.
9831.0,Patient,"they're like also predators, you know. Like going to do whatever they want they're too smart, like it or not, like you know. off police dogs."
480.0,Provider,yeah but.
9831.0,Patient,"You know I like to run and do stuff you know active things and I haven't been doing them, but I think that when they can go outside it's going to be a lot better because. I want to do stuff. yeah yeah so that's good."
480.0,Provider,"So how are things with the relationship, right now, are you guys talking, are you cordial."
9831.0,Patient,it's really annoying we talk all the time about like really intense topics it's. exhausting I don't.
480.0,Provider,know I let Jerry I don't. want it.
9831.0,Patient,"I think that we broke up because we're yeah we're very different like we're very different and, like in the long term, maybe it's not gonna work out, and I think that putting like so much pressure in terms of like having these labels like for me it's a lot about. I don't know like yeah I get in my head about things like girlfriend and like maybe we you know if you're dating your might get married or something and it's like Okay, but what does that even look like. And so I think i'm definitely a haunted by like past relationships and trauma like specifically like a lot of trauma that. Brain launches me is what I say, and so, then, like the beginning of a new relationship, I have like a lot of issues that I have to recommend or like. Like patterns that are, I find myself and that are not healthy and then like I think about. What I think like I know what they want, for me, and then I turned they're like actor certain way, but it's not like so conscious like that you know, but it just ends up happening and then like time passes. And I find myself like super upset about certain things and i'm just like Okay, but. You know, you were like doing that you know, like why, why do you say those things by talk like that or act like that. Because you probably think that that's what you know, like you're meant to do. Right that's like the role I get into like a lot of like. So it's like perform everything is about me it's like performance it's all like what's my role and then i'll perform that role. So if I think something is my role, then it's like Okay, so I was really confused also like, and I think in general that's a really. Tough thing about dating is like what's your role like as a like as a girlfriend boyfriend or whatever you know, and I think we were all like influenced by you know these like societal gender roles like. Women cooking clean, and so I found myself and so it's like it was like an innate pressure, like a bad based on like past trauma experiences like you know, in general, society, but so, then I like snapped out of it and then. I don't know there were like other things yeah we're like really different like we have different views on politics and."
480.0,Provider,"that's hard, especially nowadays."
9831.0,Patient,"Really yeah yeah so it's really hard and i'm like I don't want to talk about that stuff but. We keep talking about it and then. Is I don't say so directly I kind of talk I held a talk about it because I always have a lot to say, and I cannot say something, sometimes I cannot say something, and sometimes I I can just listen and i'm just like i'm not gonna waste my breath but. yeah."
480.0,Provider,"Anyway, so bottom isn't. yeah it seems like. The issue with the relationship is you weren't showing up as your authentic self in the beginning of the relationship so then your needs weren't met because. You were like you said playing a role of what you thought you should be. yeah how you should act and so that's, something that would be good to work on in therapy is like, how do I show up as my authentic self and forget about all this society pressure that trauma wounds all of that, and still. show up as me and get my needs met in a relationship."
9831.0,Patient,"yeah yeah so that's yeah so that is something you know, like I work on but it's definitely. Like i'm always doing yeah like it's yeah it's hard. So yeah I need to work on that for sure, because it keeps happening and it's really upsetting so i'm just like. i'm concerned that they're like thinking these things about me and they're really not thinking, these are like you know that they're like to you know that they're tricking me or doing certain things to like mess with me. And then also he, like was in the some similar situation like he also. found himself feeling like. I don't know, like, I guess, like any pressure to like I don't know be somebody or something i'm like I don't know, but he definitely said that he's also a paranoid, and like worries that like i'm tricking him or like and there's like just communication skills barriers like. way that we communicate and interpret communication is very. It causes issues so like. yeah so like mixed messages are like not taking so like I feel like he doesn't say exactly what it means, and I say exactly what I mean, and he does not believe me, what I say so, he has trouble. I don't know, in a sense, trusting the things I say like so what his says is like taking me at my word. he's like you have to learn to take you at your word and then like yeah like I don't say stuff that's not true, like that I don't really think you know I tried to be accurate, obviously, maybe my opinion or feelings change. In time, as an you know I wouldn't hold you to something you said, like you know. throw it don't throw it in my face, but like he does throw it in my face because he's like well, you said that another time, so you think something different, and that is a problem I have with people like. You know they hate me or whatever and they're like well you're not the same person that you know blah blah blah and i'm like well no that's like."
480.0,Provider,you're supposed to change and grow that's the.
9831.0,Patient,"Point yeah so that's why i'm just like yeah no that's never going to be me like. So don't so I said in the very beginning and throughout like reminders like don't have assumptions and don't have expectations of me because i'm always. Developing and so you know if you want to know something like ask and if something upsets you about the way I do things or is unclear like tell me. That it upsets you like I won't be offended. But see that's the thing like I said i'm very like direct like that and and he does get offended So if I say something he turns to take real personal offense and i'm like. I don't like a like a personalized. Like like like it's not like a personal attack like I don't want you to think like you know. it's just you know I just have to say, like please don't like please only the serial ALBAN because it gets stale we have a big issue about the cereal being left open so we're not eating cereal anymore, but we have a solution, you know, like we're not sharing."
480.0,Provider,If you want to keep your MAC. and make it go stale cool.
9831.0,Patient,"that's you know, like that's fine i'm always like preferences are valid. But we both deserve to have our preferences yeah. met you know, like that's what we deserve and I just you know I just don't want to think that you're like leaving it open. And just because, like you just don't care what I feel like having cereal that's not saying, but now he just knows that he's just gonna leave it open because he forgets and he thought about it, and obviously I don't get bothered by certain things also like and. So that's totally you know, and I might go that's fine you know we just have to have a solution."
480.0,Provider,"You have to and that's The thing is, you have to have that communication the. boundaries and then. Like you said if you're going to be sharing space and not be in an intimate relationship, there needs to be respect for the boundaries that you said basically."
9831.0,Patient,yeah.
480.0,Provider,Is he said you guys are like boyfriend girlfriend or is he okay with that.
9831.0,Patient,"um. I think he's like confused, I mean he's like seems to be okay, with it, but. Now he's like roles that things is a thing, and so, like, I had a conversation with him the other day I was like I know I talked a lot about. You know my goals in life, and what I want out of Lino life and obviously time kind of changes, like every day because i'm like trying to figure out what my next move is. And that encompasses like dating and family and career occurs huge for me so but. In terms of us, you know what we're doing, obviously we live together, and we have a fuse now, and so I want to know, like what do you want like what are your needs like what are your aspirations in life and in this in this like contacts. Right, as I feel like I talk a lot and I don't know like you just listen to I don't actually know like what do you want out of you know, life and stuff and. yeah and so, then we both realized we don't want to have kids. Like maybe until like 10 years later and don't want to get married until maybe like 10 years later, like in general and so that's what I was asking I was like you know, like in general, like like don't just base your answer, based on."
480.0,Provider,What.
9831.0,Patient,"What I say. Or what I want you know, like it's like a general question you know what I mean like don't like you know or whatever society thinks or your mom or me or. Whatever you know because, like, for me, the pressure was oh when are you going to graduate when do you get a job when your career follow it was never like other people, I heard about in. Cultural families where they're like. When are you going to get a girlfriend when are you going to get a boyfriend when are you going to get married, like, for me it was never that it was always about career. And yeah so that was so so that's why I was just like you know what do you actually want I think it's important for you to not just because I find myself just kind of rolling with things. and letting situations happen to me and I caught myself doing that. Again, and I did, and I was really like. You know upset with that I love myself, like, I was very like depressed or whatever and i'm like I can't just let life happen to me, you know, and I feel like that's something that we both do and not like some lots of people do that. So just wanted to give you that. opportunity like to really you know, and so, then he told me, you know he wants to live off grid as like his ultimate goal. And like having a partner means having like someone like that has your back who basically like to go to functions with so they. have to go alone, and like you know if anything happens like you know they can call your partner in the case of emergency. And so, like that was a big difference like for me at the opposite like I don't really take my and we had a conversation about this like. Because I didn't invite him to this camping trip, my friend invited me to, and I was like Well, first of all I don't even want to go, so no i'm not inviting you but second of all it's not my trip so i'm not inviting you. There I don't know these people so i'm not inviting you before the ball also like I don't hang out with my friends, how much, so I probably wouldn't invite you, regardless if I was like in the mood to go like. Because I haven't seen this person in a long time it's different if you're there like I just I just like to hang you know what I mean like."
480.0,Provider,I don't hang out with my friends that often so it's like yeah you know one on one time.
9831.0,Patient,"yeah but. You know I don't think about it, like Oh, that my partner is to take two functions are like you know so that I have one with my family and friends like. it's more like it's it's very it's I read his article on psychology today and I like recommended it to him about like relationship problems that low income versus high income sex couples half and I found it really insightful. How like high sex couples are more independent versus low sex they're codependent because they have different issues right in life so like if you're low sex you're. more focused on you know financials, obviously, and so you are more codependent because of those situations, but then, when your highest yes that's not really that's not an issue at all, and so that doesn't manifest. into issues so relationship either. And there are more independent and they're focused more on like hobbies and."
480.0,Provider,makes a lot of sense. He said it was a psycho.
9831.0,Patient,"yeah so that was yeah That was really cool yeah it was say recently psychology today, I read that one, and then I read this one about Father list mother no children like Father yeah so like they talked about that Filipino Canadian tennis player and and, like her father's role. So that was really interesting and then I was telling George how like what they talked about, and the father roles in that article is like what my mom did for me. it's like teaching you to be competitive and risk taking, and to not leave your life with fear. And how like that plays a role, obviously, and like successful young women, and then there was another one, I read about marijuana use and depression it's just like yeah. Like yeah now it's kind of like more I mean, for me it was more obvious, but it was also really good you know you know doesn't work. It doesn't you're."
480.0,Provider,Saying. Is a lot of people saying marijuana's really good for anxiety and it feels yes treating it in the short term but long term research shows. That over a long period of marijuana is actually increases anxiety overall.
9831.0,Patient,"yeah yeah yeah so I definitely you know I mean I I definitely like you know studied that in school and. I assume you know read about it so super interesting to me, I feel my camera my masters in marriage and family therapy like I said career is a really stressful topic for me and I waiver back and forth between what masters, I want to pursue, like every day. But i'm I mean, I find myself now like I have all these freakin versions of myself in my head and all these voices they don't shut up having conversations in my brain and. You know my grandma's bipolar on my dad's side and his cousin is gets a friend, I can. You know, blah blah blah all these other issues mental health issues that are like not diagnosed in my family, so I know that myself I started smoking weed when I was 13 and I have been since then, so I you know i'm just like well environmental factors, you know."
480.0,Provider,Like.
9831.0,Patient,"Like like attachment disorder genetic you know what I mean this. sounds just like you know it makes sense to make sense, make sense. So let me ask you something do you."
480.0,Provider,Ever feel like your paranoia increases when you're smoking weed because that's another research. link is bipolar. yeah is not not great to be using week because it can exacerbate like any of the manic.
9831.0,Patient,"symptoms yeah. So I definitely increases the mania for me, which is, I mean i'd like it. Obviously, like i'm very aware that it's dangerous and like what i'm doing but I like it, you know that's the problem."
480.0,Provider,With bipolar. People with bipolar to take their meds because the mania is fun and feels good and.
9831.0,Patient,"yeah that's our favorite part. So it's like. We want it to be very long lived and like maximum. yeah but no yeah in terms of like I did that I, you know i've gone like very long like for me it's like significant periods of time like months, like several months different phases, that I did several months completely sober. Completely not smoking versus like you know, taking dummies versus like the dummies is like super in moderation, very. intentional versus like okay just CBD. To really like I always do i'm i'm a researcher like i'm always doing research my whole life is a study, but so. I think that definitely the long term use contributes a lot to the paranoia. yeah i'm the. But when i'm not like regularly using or like long term it's still there, or when i'm not so like the most important part of what I was doing was I was completely sober I didn't take any dummies no smoking no nothing. For several months and I needed to see how I was because I needed to see like how am I without that you know, and obviously there were like withdrawal symptoms but whatever, but not without withdrawal symptoms but, like my brain and my body is. Has issues on its own, like it wasn't it was I needed to see if it was cannabis induced right like yeah overuse or whatever and it's definitely just me, which is what I thought, like, I always I always knew, you know, I was using it to kind of like. work with these other things, was going on with me, but it had been doing it so long, I had to like remind myself. You know what i'm actually like. And so I yeah I found out like yeah. It sucks to be me like there's a lot of voices in my head like they got real loud when I was sober like. yeah they got real loud. And they wouldn't you know, so it was really hard, it was really hard, it was really, really hard, I mean it's still hard every day, I mean I do use gmail now again, which I have feelings about but."
480.0,Provider,I don't really like. bipolar at all.
9831.0,Patient,"No, no, so yeah like I kind of just have those gummy things, but I also don't even like find myself wanting them anymore like. yeah no I don't want to like smoke anymore, you know, and I don't know yeah and any yeah. So that's yeah something else is like you know we're different and like lifestyle preferences like I quit drinking and. You know, he doesn't not you know, has not he has his own problems with addictions, and like alcohol and so a lot of bottom is very triggering like he reminds me of my parents and like issues or whatever um. But we have a possible to have."
480.0,Provider,A healthy relationship if he's a trigger for your trauma.
9831.0,Patient,"Yes, so no. I mean, I think, no but I mean for me, the first thing is like well, so what like i'm just never going to you know, like a lot of things are triggering to me like like i'm realizing it more and more like Wednesday pod me in the face, one day, and I just started crying because. First of all, I was really tired. And like frustrated, but then second of all, I was just like I just feel like everyone's face in life. Like getting emotional pasta, the face, you know us to the face, like you know dude DC yeah so i'm just like very like trigger like in different ways, like this is a metaphor for my life, but also literal one like people have hit me in the face. So yeah I don't know it's just like i'm just like a ticking time bomb and I don't like that, so I like to think it less of like oh like. I can't fix him account like changed who he is like he is who he is like you know he has problems he says the wrong words and he's learning, but like. What about me like you know it's just going to go to whatever person new person is so i'm just like at this point in my life i've been dating since I was 15 and a half, which is also problematic, but I just want to be alone. yeah I don't want to date for like a decade and like i'm fine with that, like. You know i'm not looking you know. decade, you know, whatever. Like whatever have like i'm."
480.0,Provider,But you know. This is when you're gonna meet the person that you're supposed to be with is when you're not looking and you don't want it that's.
9831.0,Patient,"Always how it happens, that is, that is how it happens, but it happens so you know yeah. I really."
480.0,Provider,"love that you're taking time for yourself like that's a really healthy decision I think it's a very mature very thoughtful decision because, like you said, if you don't take time for yourself and work on all the trauma triggers than anybody's gonna. trigger you and any relationship is eventually going to fail."
9831.0,Patient,yeah.
480.0,Provider,"So, and a lot of people don't understand that that's why most relationships don't work out because. Most people think that they don't have to heal themselves in order to love someone else but the problem is when you don't heal yourself you're showing up with as a bundle of trauma for someone else to just pull. Up yeah you know."
9831.0,Patient,"yeah. yeah so yeah that's yeah so i'm trying to learn how to not over share also because I feel like I give too much of like my details and my trauma details to people and then. email unnecessary information. And then I worry that they're using it against me which they may or may not be, but the fact that I worry that they are is a problem to me exactly."
480.0,Provider,Because the people in the past.
9831.0,Patient,But writing for me there's.
480.0,Provider,"it's not a problem to share things with people if you're going to let it go as soon as it comes out of your mouth, but like you said if you're going to sit there and worry that they're going to use it against you then it's better to just not share at all. Because then you're spending emotional energy and time worrying for me, probably no reason."
9831.0,Patient,"yeah so yeah I you know. I got to take a break and focus on myself and that's what I was telling also George about this camping thing I don't want to meet new people that's a lot of work. I have to focus on myself and, like my friend who's going. also get social anxiety, but like that's something that hinders them from being social and i'm like oh see that's that's the opposite I tend to be very social and outgoing and that's like. My comfort zone and I got to put myself out of my comfort zone and stay home and like focus on myself and my responsibilities and my self care and that's really the hard part for me so yeah."
480.0,Provider,me too. I would much rather be out talking to strangers than home alone thinking.
9831.0,Patient,i'm not going camping. yeah I have like a things work on. But yeah I do have a question very specific question about the dogs. will be able to. Like sign a letter fax it to you about having them and emotional support animal.
480.0,Provider,"And one of them. I don't think I can because bright heart has a policy we're not supposed to sign anything that's not just a letter basically saying you're in our Program. Because a liability came up. But. I do know because I did this one time with one of my dogs there's a website online, let me see if I can. figure it out. um there's the website online it's really cheap you pay and they basically just give you the certification, you have to and fill out a questionnaire and there's. Literally like a doctor that reads over the questionnaire and then gives you the certification thing because I had to do that with. Our old house, we were only supposed to have two dogs and we had three, but one of them was actually an emotional support dog for my son. yeah let me see emotion."
9831.0,Patient,"there's also something I feel guilty about, because I can I can see the dogs emotionally supporting me. Like they know when i'm feeling like sensitive or something and like they'll come and like help me and I just you know I don't want to like I think of them as kids you know I don't want to."
480.0,Provider,be like.
9831.0,Patient,That kid who they're paying uses them for emotional support or like because they're lonely.
480.0,Provider,"Well, why that dogs are meant for but."
