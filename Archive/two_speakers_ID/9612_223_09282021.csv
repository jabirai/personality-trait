9612.0,Patient,"Well, I just OK, so the The pre op doctor asked me to go down on my suboxone yesterday I took three because I was having bad back pain, I had worked so much this week. right today i'm gonna. Just try to stick to to I would prefer one but. I just wanted to double check that. The doctor with bright heart the man that spoke to the pre op doctor is going to be available to speak with this doctor if needed. um Okay, I guess, another question is when they do pain control on me in the hospital with morphine or whatever drip or whatever. That suboxone won't block it right."
223.0,Provider,"know that that that will work and that's the sort of conversation that Dr Khan, is our chief medical officer and he is a lot of experience, you know with all this and he is the person. That spoke with your doctor before, so I have no idea what his schedule is like tomorrow, but I will send him an email. And a message, you know as soon as we're done. yeah idea kind of what. Do you want him to call your doctor or."
9612.0,Patient,"No, and maybe just an email to check in say he's available for any questions or whatever, but. I I guess it's just my own personal worry and I just I wanted to go to the group so bad last week and usually they just have a dinner, they all leave the bar. room come in, it was terrible I mean I made great money so that was that was good, but."
223.0,Provider,"At least she checked in though I was really impressed by that, because you know clearly you were struggling a lot right there, but you know you checked in so."
9612.0,Patient,That was great yeah.
223.0,Provider,"But i'm sorry you didn't have the whole time, but this is good, we have this time here. So you know the email of your doctor."

223.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
9612.0,Patient,"Okay, so i'm also the video, and let me go on real quick. yeah I was really concerned about the whole How are they going to control my opinion if i'm on suboxone so."
223.0,Provider,"yeah well that's I know that Dr Khan always recommends that people do not go off it they stay on it, and then they can go ahead and and you know do whatever. You know, regular medication is that they use and I don't know the details because that's sort of not my area of specialty. Right, but you know he certainly would be able to have another caution and i'm kind of assuming they probably had that conversation, but it was so many months ago that be good to have you know refresh that."
9612.0,Patient,yeah that's what I was thinking to just a you know okay so she's finally having a surgery. And yeah yeah so um quick question would we would we give them the pre op doctor or my actual doctor that's doing the surgery.
223.0,Provider,You know if you have both emails he can just easily send an email to both of them and then you know we'll see who responds.
9612.0,Patient,"Okay sure all right, let me, let me get here and choose the recipient okay. So. we'll try this guy up see. And of course it's just saying his name. wow Okay, so that won't work dang it."

223.0,Provider,"yeah that's. that's pretty common because, generally. Most medical people do not give out their emails and you've got like a route, like you, do you know through. A charge, you know, like a medical based. Facility based no email messaging thing, so why don't you give me both of their names, if you know first names as well and."
9612.0,Patient,Some numbers yeah so.
223.0,Provider,"we'll do that, so what it was Dr scott's first name, do you know."
9612.0,Patient,"yeah i'm Dr Scott is. Nice send a message to doctors office, Dr Scott. Andrew. Scott is general surgery. Okay, and then the The pre op doctor is. Oh wow that's an interesting one katie a U. H ey n E."

9612.0,Patient,"So it says ballin on sign yeah call me and i'm sure i'm saying that wrong but that's. But that's The pre op doctor and. Let me just get right here, real real fast and then at least give you one phone number for the pre op. If you have questions about your procedure, how to prepare call the office of Dr Scott and that one is. 7007651."
223.0,Provider,Okay. And 70707651 1062. Okay.
9612.0,Patient,i'll go to Dr bollen on. One second here and.
223.0,Provider,I gotta go.
9612.0,Patient,No problem. Is. that's the testing. You know I went to benny on us last night and they asked for your Vaccination Card.
223.0,Provider,"yeah that's happened more and more places I went to the University of Washington huskies football game, on Saturday, and we had to show a vaccination card to get into stadium."
9612.0,Patient,"that's crazy I couldn't believe it and I thought down the street at taco bell I wonder if they're standing there asking for it it's weird. I was vaccinated but. yeah it was crazy Okay, so it says the pre op assistant will generally call you the last business day, so I have the pre op assistance number or pre operative department. So, which one, do you think."
223.0,Provider,"Well, why don't you give me both and then you know we've got options."
9612.0,Patient,Okay pre op assistant is 707-624-3095. That preoperative department.
223.0,Provider,Is 707 624-386-5865 okay. What time. Is your surgery.
9612.0,Patient,"that so far it says on there 545 in the morning but they're going to call me today, and let me know for sure."
223.0,Provider,Okay.
9612.0,Patient,I cuz I could change they don't know and it's weird it said on the pre op form that be there three to four hours before your.
223.0,Provider,Probably the 545 is three or four hours before the actual schedule surgery. Because they never have you show up at two or three in the morning but showing up you know before six that's not uncommon.
9612.0,Patient,"Okay, yes."
223.0,Provider,"Because if your first thing in the morning, you know there'll be fresh and you won't have to wait, because you know, sometimes surgeries for longer, and then the people who are scheduled later end up you know going a lot later, which you know if you're fasting you just can't eat for longer."
9612.0,Patient,"Right right yeah you would not be eight hours before and then nothing to drink the next day, I mean you could have black coffee or something but i'm not gonna bother. You and i've been doing this, this was funny I got a prescription for my Preston. I should have asked you a couple weeks ago, it says apply to your nair's n ar E, F didn't know what the hell that was thought it was a misspelling."
223.0,Provider,"yep no no that's it's this this. Inside part and what that is is just in case you've got something like Murcia or staff or something like that inside your nose that that is. A topical antibiotic, for you know different like skin infections and and so you just put that in there and just case you have something that will protect you from any potential infection, you know, affecting you at your surgery site."
9612.0,Patient,"Right and yeah I definitely don't want to get staff, my God and then they have. thing ordered this body wash that I could use as an extra helper but they didn't give it to me because they couldn't give it to me prescription and for the life of me I can't figure out the name of it so i'm going to go in here to the pharmacy and ask them what it is it's a. whole body wash of some sort think it's in a blue bottle but I don't know."
223.0,Provider,"yeah it's something that is just you know very antiseptic you know that will really clean all because you know our skin has a lot of bacteria on it, I mean we all do, even you know when we're totally. You know, healthy in no problem, but you know you just sort of want to take all the precautions, you can. Right, and so they want you like to take a shower using that in the morning, or something."
9612.0,Patient,"yeah yeah. So i'm gonna. figure out what that is and make sure I get it before I leave here today. And I mean on my. throat checked out just as a safety precaution because of them being such a heavy smoker for so long, so I just want to make sure my throat Okay, so they made an appointment for this morning, so here I am."
223.0,Provider,Oh okay yeah are you having. Having general anesthesia or kind of local.
9612.0,Patient,No general they're putting me on.
223.0,Provider,"yeah so they want to check, you know just make sure that you know if they intubate you that you know for the Anastasia. yeah you're at Kaiser right. Now, has Kaiser Vallejo."
9612.0,Patient,Okay hi oh yeah and then they'll be here for five days approximately in demand. For mainly for pain control.
223.0,Provider,"yeah okay. And, and so, is it a double hernia surgery or what exactly is it."
9612.0,Patient,called I total reconstructive stomach surgery.
223.0,Provider,Oh boy.
9612.0,Patient,"yep they're getting they're pulling my muscle walls together they're getting rid of their hernias. You know, putting them out there, building me a belly button and getting rid of all the loose skin."
223.0,Provider,Oh okay yeah because it's like like when your skin pulls apart the hernia is actually your intestine your small intestines usually. That can go through an opening in your muscles and so by tightening all that up you know it gives you a really solid solid foundation to prevent that from happening again so.
9612.0,Patient,In the main part of the whole story is that I don't do a God dang thing and doing exactly what i'm told I don't lift anything I don't do anything and that is going to be tough on me and. Yes. If I see it out. 30 or oh.
223.0,Provider,"Go yeah housecleaning because they don't usually want you to live. More than five or maybe 10 pounds so probably at first just five because your stomach buses are so engaged. yeah be really careful with that, I mean if you can get somebody else to do any of the lifting I mean even the vacuum cleaners, going to be more than that."
9612.0,Patient,"Oh yeah I could yeah no i'm gonna i'm going to give myself a lot of time on that I told my daughter, if you get too overwhelmed and it's just too much around here, I will we will hire a cleaning a friend of mine who will come clean the House, you know. Because I do want want the House to just fall apart because i'm not there, cleaning it. But ya know time for my daughter to learn she's got to do more, you know."
223.0,Provider,"Yes, absolutely how old is she. 21 yeah for sure."
9612.0,Patient,"yeah. She took out yeah she's got the time off of work right now she took the family medical leave act. Good so she's going to get a little money, not a great deal, but a little money and she'll be home, taking care of me so."
223.0,Provider,"Oh that's wonderful I mean that's that's what you'll need because you know it is, as I know you, you know you're you're very determined and energetic and you're right, I can do it kind of person. And if you didn't have somebody there, who is going to be helping you I would be really afraid you just jump out of bed and do this thing yeah yeah. The same way, so I get that it's like you know we sometimes have to let go and let somebody else take care of US yeah we just hard to do, because we know we can do it better ourselves. Yes, exactly. Well, I will send. an email to Dr Khan, and asked him if he can check in with either Dr Scott your surgeon or the pre op Doc today and that your surgery is scheduled, you know very early in the morning tomorrow so."
9612.0,Patient,And then I took three suboxone yesterday and.
223.0,Provider,"To to. To today, and so the main question you want him to ask your doctor is."
9612.0,Patient,"Just to make sure that the pain can be under control. You know, keeping control I just I guess the main thing I wanted to ask you, because you wouldn't know is this suboxone is it going to block all the drugs they give me in the hospital, because that would be a severe problem."
223.0,Provider,Oh yeah no they I mean they do this type of surgery all the time.
9612.0,Patient,"and patience that takes a boxing. Yes, okay. Now it's finding anything to worry about and i'm gravitating forfeit. ship."
223.0,Provider,yeah no i'll get these. questions answered for you and i'll send you a message and have her email you back.
9612.0,Patient,"Okay, great and then all just I more than likely, I will not be a group next week."
223.0,Provider,"Oh yeah. yeah you're not gonna be a group tomorrow night for sure, and next week either and you'll just barely get out of the hospital so i'll make sure to the list you as excused for those."
9612.0,Patient,"Okay, great great until everybody I said Hello and everything's gonna be great."
223.0,Provider,"Okay. we'll do. That it's going to be great and i'm so glad that this is finally happening for you it's been just sort of dangling over your head for such a long time. And I think you're going to you know it won't be easy, but once you get through, and you know you're in the healing process I think you're going to be so happy to get this taken care of yeah."
9612.0,Patient,"yeah and truthfully i've been lucky, with all the lifting and stuff I do that hasn't birth, so it is a danger and i'm getting rid of that danger so. yeah it'd be good, how was your new place."
223.0,Provider,"Well, I still have lots of boxes i'm working you know because there's just it's not just unpacking there's so many other things that you know I need to be. Doing so i'm working on it, but you know and i've got I can delivering a few things today so that's good that'll kind of keep me here and it's like you know it's just staying focused it's like. there's a lot of things you know, in terms of storage even getting you know kind of new shelving and things like that."
9612.0,Patient,lining their shelves and unpacking and organizing and all of it haha.
223.0,Provider,"yeah it takes it takes a while, but i'm really, really glad to be here and it's so much it's so nice to be around my friends, again, you know I had more social connection in the last month that i've been here, and probably that i've had in the last four years."
9612.0,Patient,"Oh fantastic they are right, where you need to be. that's great."
223.0,Provider,"I was getting lonely down there, and so this is this is great i'm very in I love, I mean it's you know little misty today and but i've got these big cedar trees, this is my. Whether my environment, I like cool weather I don't mind cold weather I don't mind the rain, I mean I like the sun, too, but you know it's it's all good so."
