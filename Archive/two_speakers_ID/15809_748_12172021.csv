ID,Role,Message
15809.0,Patient,"Okay hi can you hear me. i'm good thanks, how are you."
748.0,Provider,wow hard to believe this is the person I met. What transformation. So tell me about you.
15809.0,Patient,"Okay, well, the last couple weeks i've been pretty good um. Yesterday I was feeling pretty stressed all day and it's because of I think it's because of a dust up with my boss, the day before."
748.0,Provider,Oh i'm sure.
15809.0,Patient,"So, which was I used to be able to just you know something happens, we resolve it, and I was fighting Wednesday, I mean day that that you know, and this is all through email it's not like shouting each other's faces or anything it's all an email interchange. But you know I used to be able to just. You know sort things out and then just go on and but you know I don't the whole next day feel stressed about it, so I hate that."
748.0,Provider,You know.
15809.0,Patient,"But you know, hopefully, that you know will work it say it itself out to so."
748.0,Provider,"And you know did that one things like that used to happen you'd be able to. Let them go, is what I hear. ya understand it and and move forward."
15809.0,Patient,yeah just move on yeah.
748.0,Provider,"And you know. One of the things that you also mentioned, is that all happens over email. As opposed to in person. yeah I want her with koeppen if that isn't making things more challenging for us emotional, because even though being in person and dealing with those things is stressful. there's more movement that happens, then the lingering like well What did he really mean and what is, you know there's a lot of lingering stuff that happens in impersonal communication. and on top of that you've been to rule."
15809.0,Patient,yeah.
748.0,Provider,So your sensitivity is heightened.
15809.0,Patient,"Well yeah I feel more prickly um you know, these days, but um you know it's not coping because this is our setup we. We hardly see each other."
748.0,Provider,Even past that.
15809.0,Patient,yeah even in the past it's normal that i'm in the office by myself and he's because we have another office in San Jose where he meets with clients and so it's kind of normal.
748.0,Provider,Okay okay.
15809.0,Patient,So.
748.0,Provider,Okay.
15809.0,Patient,"But and it's not like I was dwelling on it, or anything yesterday, but I just my it was a physical reaction my body just felt, you know it wasn't my mind, it was my body was just all day I had like a stress headache and I feel great today."
748.0,Provider,"Today, on okay good."
15809.0,Patient,"I know I got I got a good night's sleep and um you know i've been real busy with Christmas stuff and. So and that's The other thing is, you know, last year I really you know I like Christmas, I usually you know i'm pretty enthusiastic and and last year I kind of just didn't you know feel like much and. So I realized that I think that's probably when I was starting to you know go down this path. um because because this year i'm. You know kind of feel like I you know, last year I couldn't even buy gifts for people I didn't even want to you know, think about that. But this year, I had my I think my enthusiasms back. So."
748.0,Provider,that's wonderful. yep that's really wonderful.
15809.0,Patient,So do you want to hear the details on the thing with my boss.
748.0,Provider,"I would i'd like very much to hear what it was like for you, what happened and and maybe look at what actually got triggered underneath the experience."
15809.0,Patient,"Okay, so I think the best way for me to summarize is, this is an email, I sent to him. kind of giving my side of how I saw. You know this happen so here, let me. Okay, and we're friends, I mean we're okay now, so I think we both kind of figured out the right thing to do so. um now that i've had some time to move this over I think you should know how this played out from my perspective, over and, and this is, I should say he's done this to me almost every year at the holidays, he. He holds things until i'm about to leave for the holidays, because I always take the last two weeks of December off. Okay, this is not a new thing. So um. yeah so over a month ago you give me a trust form, signed by both trustees along with a bunch of the truck clients trust documents I say great but there's not much I can do without a signed new account form and driver's license copy, so this is like well before thanksgiving. Like early November. So I tell them, you know I can't do anything with this, but I need these other two things so soon after that you forward a copy of his driver's. license, and I say great, but we still need a new account form, signed by this guy. So, and then I put back then and caps you tell me you in caps are working on getting the sign new account for. You then drop the whole thing until last week, when you asked me how the transfers progressing now transfer can't happen until the accounts open so he's he's expecting be to be done before a's done. And he is waiting on him. So anyway, I rolled my eyes and again explain, he has never signed the new account form, along with tamra. So that's another client, mind you, the file is in your possession, as I tried to recount what documents we have using memory only. You do not reply to this message, so I don't know if you got it you later acknowledge you received it with a slew of other emails. Then this week you send a look into why this has not transferred message sort of implying that I or shareholders are being derelict. When the whole time it has been up to you, I again explain the missing new account form, so this is now four times i've had to tell you the new account form is MIA. You then obtain the sign new account for the day before I leave for the holidays and that's all in caps with three exclamation point. So in this case Lisa is not being crazy, it is fully being aggravating condescending and unreasonable. I realized you've been having to deal with a whole lot of crazy from your assistant this year and I really appreciate and I really appreciate your patience and support and that's all in bold underlined and. But when you operate this way it really adds to my anxiety and frustration. As a compromise, I will prepare all the paperwork for you to submit I have that part doesn't matter. I do love you and your family but feel that I need to start being more honest when I feel you are damaging to my mental health. i'm sorry if I cause you worry and stating that I would not be working on this today, because on Wednesday, I kind of was like this is not acceptable that you dumped this on me at the last minute, so that's that's a previous email. So please enjoy your time with Lena and wish her the happiest of birthdays for me her his wife's birthday was yesterday. cheers and happy holidays."
748.0,Provider,What was his response.
15809.0,Patient,"I haven't seen it yet. So I think he thinks i'm out, you know for a while, so he's probably thinking you know don't lie be something when I get back. But i'm probably going to call him today because there's a couple things that. I. i'm going to ask him to check in and asked him if the instructors I left them instructions on how to do this himself, because he also we also turned out to be missing a tax ID number so. There was also other things that I couldn't do you know, to get it in for him so."
748.0,Provider,wow.
15809.0,Patient,"Anyway, so."
748.0,Provider,"Well, it it definitely sounds intense I definitely heard how angry, you were. You know that's in terms of communication that's one thing you might want to. Thank think about doing differently, the next time is instead of. Blaming him which I completely understand i'm not saying that's inaccurate. But instead of doing it so blatantly because then all you're going to get from him his reaction if instead you just stayed what you're feeling. i'm feeling angry and unseen when I tried to be so clear about this, that kind of thing, as opposed to you did this because people react to that right we react when somebody blames us some points the finger."
15809.0,Patient,"yeah he's pretty thick skinned so. Okay, I don't know. he's very um. He doesn't hear subtlety."
748.0,Provider,Okay. If I don't.
15809.0,Patient,Tell him knowing ya.
748.0,Provider,Mera enough.
15809.0,Patient,"yeah so um. So, once he gets what he wants he'll you know but yeah I did feel sort of discarded and ignored until he gained interest back into this thing yeah but then to be kind of like Well now, you or shareholders, this is the company we work with. You know why didn't this happen, well, it didn't happen because you know. yeah so he obviously forgot the whole what happened in November. And so I I know he's not intentionally I mean, I understand, too, that he's he's a nice guy and he's not intentionally like gaslighting me or anything I understand that, but um. You know he's kind of the more big picture guy and so he forgets like i'm the detail person and he's the big picture guy so we're really good in that we fill each other's gaps. Because, sometimes I can't see the big picture, because i'm so focused on the details. And then you know he's not very good at remembering details yeah so we actually work really well together, but I do like I said, this is not the first time, and so i'm kind of sensitive to it because it's like. Every year, I kind of think see cuz I. And like Okay, I only got a week left this this, and this is what I gotta do, and you know i'm very like. You know I mean working with clients and stuff there's always stuff you can't plan, I mean because you don't know what a client's gonna you know. But i'm always kind of like. You know at this point, no more new requests if somebody needs something they now need to call the company or what you know i'm so i'm very kind of like planning ahead of before i'm going to be out for a while. And he's less so, so you know. But um. yeah so."
748.0,Provider,"Well, and i'm really grateful that you actually explained a little further about the dynamics of the relationship and how he hears and receives communication and how. Straightforward you have to be for him to get it that helped a lot, and so I can really understand, though, how that would have caused heightened response and you end my senses, you probably know, you're saying more how things impact you. Whereas in the past, you may not have noticed this."
15809.0,Patient,"yeah I was just so busy or whatever just Oh well, that's done."
748.0,Provider,"And, and even been tired, the next day, but not notice the connection, because you were so busy being the way you'd always been."
15809.0,Patient,"And I also think cuz so he's from Belgium, he said, you know European guy, and so I think there's some cultural because, with my background my mom being Japanese i'm. You know, like my brother will never say no, if he says, maybe it means no and you know i'm i'm not quite like that, but I, you know I have that like I don't like to tell people sometimes straight out things you know that I try to. You know, and then also another thing of the dynamics of our personality so i'm actually Felipe my boss, is the one who, when his kids were in school. there's this thing about a rock being in the road I don't know if you've heard that the so there's a big Rock in the road and there's one personality that will come and kick the rock out of the road. And there's another personality that will see the rock and and stop and cry and not get around the rock. And then there's another personality that walks around the rock and there's two or three other ones I don't remember what those are but i'm the one who will walk around the rock I don't push the rock he's the one who would come up and just kick the rock right out of the way. So. You know so like I said in some ways we really mesh really well because we kind of fill in each other's gaps, but it also sometimes can be frustrating and i'm sure he's frustrated with me, sometimes to."
748.0,Provider,write what I. What I hear you saying is also that you dealt with this differently than you usually do you actually addressed the rock.
15809.0,Patient,"yeah I usually pie would have just been like gold like I said roll my eyes and sigh and fine i'll just you know, whatever and. You know cuz I did the paper and it turned out it wasn't that hard so I mean I was cuz there, this was a trust that had all kinds of like someone resigned and it was kind of. it's not a straightforward thing, so I was level like I don't want to do this on my last day being an office you know. But I did it and it wasn't that hard, but like I said I didn't I let him i'm like i'm doing it for you, and then you are the one that needs to work with the company on if they have questions and there's probably going to be a back and forth and i'm not going to be here for that anyway. Right so. What."
748.0,Provider,reach out to you when you're off or is he good with boundaries.
15809.0,Patient,"he's pretty good with boundaries. I mean if there's something that. You know. i'll know off the top of my head that's really hard for him to well because yeah I had told him i'm like this is not acceptable, you need to do this yourself or. i'll do it when I get back in 2020 you know, in January and then so he sent me an email to that saying I tried. But I i'm not familiar with this and then, can you please, and please and cat, can you please work on this for me so and then so that email that I read us the response to his like I tried to do it myself, but I really you know. I guess couldn't do it so. um. yep so."
748.0,Provider,"Well, one of the things he really indicated in that that please, please, is how much you need to you and values so that's a good and I knew that already because you've been working together a long time."
15809.0,Patient,20 years next year. yeah I started in 2002.
748.0,Provider,"amazing. And it served you well, it feels like."
15809.0,Patient,"yeah cuz it was you know when my son was like in elementary school, I had the freedom to like be a mom who drove on the field trips, and I mean I was a working mom. So I did work, but I was able to be like hey my son has a field trip on taken you know such and such day off to you know drive. You know him and some of his buddies or whatever to whatever they were doing so yeah it's it's offered me a lot of flexibility. And then, now that i'm older, you know it's now that i'm an empty nester it's you know still it's even more flexible than it was because back then, we were like kind of the business, we were building the business and. Looking for clients and you know that kind of thing and now we're just kind of like just holding steady and just servicing our existing clients and not really seeking out new people so."
748.0,Provider,"that's great. that's really great it does feel like it is serving you in a lot of ways, which is wonderful."
15809.0,Patient,"yeah I think I mean, I think I got a little bit burned out, but I think it also is good for me. To have intellectual and like I said he's been really good about you know. When I when I came back and. You know he's like what can I do to to make you know things Okay, for you and I was just like yeah you could just be the all I don't really want to deal with clients directly for a while and he was like no problem so."
748.0,Provider,"Well that's really going yeah. yeah well good for you, for standing up for yourself that's a big you know that's a big moment and I imagine that, because you did do something so differently. By going and looking at the rock and saying there's a rock in the road and i'm naming this rock and we're going to move it together i'm not doing it alone and i'm not avoiding. You know that, by doing that that was probably tiring because it was such new and it may not seem like a big deal, but it was a big deal."
15809.0,Patient,"yeah I guess so but yeah I was kind of just like so yesterday I was sort of beating myself up of like Why am I, like. Why Why am I feeling this way I mean there wasn't anything stressful yesterday at all other than yeah I was cleaning up or being out until next year um but I mean there wasn't anything bad or anything you know but. I don't know so it's kind of frustrating to."
748.0,Provider,"Well, and."
15809.0,Patient,"feelings, with no reason for them, you know."
748.0,Provider,"And and there's the problem right there there's the thing that's the most challenging no reason for do you hear that judgment that was a reason. There was a reason for them, but that part of us that is so critical of ourselves is insidious and invisible like you didn't even catch that how hard you were being yourself. When that that dynamic in that interchange was stressful."
15809.0,Patient,"But you know I got I got my haircut yesterday and I i've had the same Gal doing my hair for probably eight years or something and so um you know, so I so after that I felt, you know she washed my hair and everything so that relaxed me. yeah so I felt a lot more relaxed after you and I told her that, too, I was like you know I come in stressed and I always leave much more relaxed when I leave you know so."
748.0,Provider,"That it is nice to do good things for ourselves and the Emperor ourselves in ways that are stress reducing. Even if they're you know tasks that needed to be taken care of. It isn't like you went for a massage and a pedicure you got your haircut which is. A tax but. But nonetheless it, it is something that benefits yeah yeah which is great. Well, good for you really. Using that experience as an opportunity to gain insight and notice new behavior and old Bay beer and feeling it inside that's really powerful."
15809.0,Patient,"yep. And so, actually I you know before that happened because I wasn't really I didn't know i'd have something to talk about my boss today um. I guess, I have to realize that i'm. I had 28 pills. And I only took 15. So I guess there's I ended up because my brain said, you only need 15 if you take more than that you might throw up blah blah blah, so I think I have to realize, there is a part of me that didn't want to. off myself. And I don't know why that's hard to. I don't know, for some reason that's hard to accept for me. That I kind of feel like I did it halfway and. I don't know."
748.0,Provider,"Well let's explore that so. Is it possible, you were spared."
15809.0,Patient,"That I was scared. Well, I don't know at that time, I felt I was more scared of life, then I was of not living. And I still feel that that's you know that life is scary. But I don't feel like you know I mean i'm so glad I didn't succeed because I realized how awful that would have been to my son. And you know at the time I was able to convince myself that Oh, you know he's probably better off. In his 20s then i'm going to get older and be a burden or whatever when he's older. um but now I kind of realized that that was just. wrap you know my brain rationalizing you know. So. But I guess the main I mean. kind of the forefront of my mind as to why I wanted to take all the pills was um. And I know the skin sound, but."
748.0,Provider,You have it down what that got cut off.
15809.0,Patient,"Oh, I didn't finish. um but. So I guess I sorta was racing to the grave my dog and my mom that. I kind of didn't want to face the two of them, you know, because my dog is probably going to be in the next year or two that. You know she's slowing down pretty quickly. And then my mom is going to be at next January. So that was in the forefront of my mind if. I want to you know, and I know that sounds really cruel because that's awful thing to do to a parent is to make them outlive you. What. i've been thinking about."
748.0,Provider,"What I really here is how much you judge yourself. Because there's not the acknowledgement that the reason we did it is because we were in in. And you didn't feel like you had any recourse. And you didn't have the capacity for whatever reason, the sense of openness. To reach out and say i'm really hurting. So there was a real alumnus in yeah. And if if I told you, I was experiencing that what would you do."
15809.0,Patient,say to get help I don't know.
748.0,Provider,"And, would you be there for me."
15809.0,Patient,yeah I try to as best I could.
748.0,Provider,And yet we judge ourselves so harshly.
15809.0,Patient,"yeah you know when. Robin Williams, you know killed himself I couldn't understand, I mean I was just like wow he's an a list celebrity well you know, but now I do now, I understand if your mind. goes it doesn't it doesn't matter how successful or how what you have or any of that if you can't escape your mind exactly so Now I understand you know. i'm. How someone like that could you know, and I told my husband because. You know the one neighbor that he involved. She told me that he thought I was leaving him. So I told him, you know so shortly after I got out of the hospital I sat down with him I just said hey you know, I just want to let you know I wasn't running away from you, I was running away from me. I was trying to get away from my my brain I can't escape my brain, you know."
748.0,Provider,"So, how did he respond to them."
15809.0,Patient,"He was he said Okay, and he doesn't talk a lot so uh he does talk a lot about what he wants to talk. But um."
748.0,Provider,But not personal things.
15809.0,Patient,"yeah yeah. So. But he just said Okay, he understands and. All right. move forward and that you know he loves me and. So."
748.0,Provider,"Well, and and see how well, you took care of him. But what about you. What about you."
15809.0,Patient,"yeah well I don't know I mean i'm pretty healthy, so I don't know that I need taken care of I mean."
748.0,Provider,What emotionally you. yeah. it's nerve support. You know and and it still feels like it's very hard for you to reach out for them.
15809.0,Patient,yeah.
748.0,Provider,"And also that there's still a voice inside that even if it's quiet thick criticizes you or even meeting. In other words, criticizes you for being human. Because we're not solitary creatures, we are Community creatures, we are social animals."
15809.0,Patient,"But I am i'm feeling i'm feeling a lot better, I think the meds Finally, maybe, are you know. But I do like I said I do you know so before before getting you know, help and all that I probably had two good days in 2021. And then now in the last couple weeks I probably had two bad days. So. that's you know, and I don't take it for granted anymore. Because you know I used to just be like what you're supposed to be norm, you know you're supposed to be not depressed or not anxious, or you know yeah um. So yeah I think. i've been i'm feeling a lot better. So."
748.0,Provider,Well that's great do you have any. goals that you've been setting for yourself how's your gardening going and you're waking up early and being back in that pattern that you like so much yeah.
15809.0,Patient,"i'm still waking up early so you know. Like that my garden, and you know it's kind of been rainy and stuff so. they're getting a lot of water, which is good um I did have some stuff with the gophers I think I might have mentioned last time they got another one of my succulents but I picked it up and i'm it's in the House now that i'm trying to rehab. To help it come back. Because succulents they can have their roots all eaten but they'll they'll certainly you know it takes. Those survive, both from the top, and the bottom, so I think i'll be able to get this one to get its roots growing again so but i'm just trying to give it some tlc to you know, out of the cold and. In the House for a little bit."
748.0,Provider,that's great.
15809.0,Patient,"yeah and then we're preparing for we're going to southern California. So i'll see my mother and you know we're looking forward to that we're leaving tomorrow and. be there on Sunday. So Oh, and another big thing I should have told you this sooner my son finished his training at the National Guard. One oh yeah so he passed and then he left um. Two days ago now, he left, for you know."
748.0,Provider,he's.
15809.0,Patient,riding his motorcycle from Florida to California so he's in Texas right now visiting with a friend of his. um. But so yeah he's on his way home and we're kind of following them sort of like how they follow Santa Claus you know across the world. we're following Brian across the country.
748.0,Provider,is so great. yeah he could easily be home for Christmas.
15809.0,Patient,"I don't think so because he's so he's he's visiting with one. Actually, a marine Gal that he was really close with before they both got out and then he's got a couple guys that he's gonna. Try to touch base with as well, so he's kind of doing a meandering. Okay friends kind of thing so i'll probably see him a little after the New Year, maybe."
748.0,Provider,"Okay, all right, I wasn't sure how long you staying that their people."
15809.0,Patient,"But yeah. So he's playing it by ear, he has its know like set, I think it depends on how welcome, he is. You know, wherever he lands and how long. You know they they want him to stay or probably how long he's having a good time to."
748.0,Provider,on his way. How he's feeling about being near.
15809.0,Patient,So yeah so you know so that's done he and we watched his graduation they live streamed it so we were able to watch it last Friday. um so that was neat.
748.0,Provider,Oh that's wonderful.
15809.0,Patient,"So yeah so i'm happy and proud for him and. have some move, but, but you know, by the way, so my boss, is the only one who, when I told him he's riding his motorcycle he's the only one who was like good for him he'll have a great time because believe my boss, he he did the same thing when he first came to the states, he. got a Harley and wrote it from the east coast to the west coast so he's done it and so like I said he's the only one who because everybody else was like oh my gosh that sounds so you know not good. um but yeah so he was like you'll have a good time and the weather right now is unseasonable E warm you know out there, although they've been having tornadoes and stuff but."
748.0,Provider,No exactly.
15809.0,Patient,"So, but hopefully he south of all that so. um but so you know mom's gotta worry but."
748.0,Provider,"Well, of course. mom also feels proud."
15809.0,Patient,"And yeah yeah yeah. And i'm happy for him, that you know he's I mean this is the time to do something like that. hulu is when you're in your 20s so. yep so."
748.0,Provider,"And I really your how proud, you are yeah. Which is window. And will you be with your mom at Christmas now is that a change that you've made."
15809.0,Patient,"Oh no we go, we went last year to um because it was my first my mom's first year without my dad so um you know I didn't want her to be alone so me and Brian my husband stayed back I don't remember why. i'm so that's the first time that he and I didn't spend Christmas together since we've been married but. I think, because a coven we've he might not have gone, because you know my mom's older and we just thought that less exposure to less people might have been a good thing and. And I think we weren't going to see his family so he's kind of like well i'll just stay home and with the dog and make it easier, on her to be home. So, but yeah usually ever here we go, we have a motor home and all three of us, and when brian's around him but us in the dog we all go down, and she we get a place on the beach to park the rig and. When she was younger she just is a total water dog she's the lab and she just loves the water and playing mall and and all that, so I don't know how it's going to be this year but we'll we'll take her and see what she can do, and you know."
748.0,Provider,Absolutely. And how long will you be with your mom.
15809.0,Patient,"Like a week. Okay yeah so we're leaving well, we have we'll get there on the 19th and then we're leaving on the 26th so Okay, maybe take a drink."
748.0,Provider,And aren't you doing something with the neighbor over the holidays as well.
15809.0,Patient,"yeah actually so last week, they had their Christmas party."
748.0,Provider,Oh okay.
15809.0,Patient,"So we went to that and, and you know, on that so she does this white elephant thing where everybody brings the gifts and you know you open them up and and you know, last year I was like let's just do one gift between the two of us me and my husband. Again, just I didn't I was just like you know we have so much stuff I don't want more stuff and you know I just didn't feel enthusiastic about it.

Over there, I mean you're in the middle of the holidays so probably mostly just being in the holidays being with your mom being. neighbors and family and so forth, but I just want to make sure that we address that if there's something you'd like to put attention on everything next couple weeks."
15809.0,Patient,"yeah I don't know mostly just you know we're going to pack and and just kind of. The day you know I know kind of the day to day stuff that. To get ready to go and all that is kind of I guess yeah so I guess that's kind of cluttering um. But um yeah I don't know. I guess i'm just enjoying feeling kind of like i'm getting back to well I don't think i'll ever be pre depression Lisa um. I I think it's made me more um. You know less judgmental and just more aware that. everybody's kind of got something go, I mean I don't think I was an unkind person, but. I think it has made me more just empathetic to you know other people and. That sometimes things just happen that you can't really control and sometimes it's even your own mind yes. And that was it. I mean that wasn't something I ever. I never experienced myself and I never even really knew somebody. i'm going through that you know, on a really close basis, we do have a neighbor her son has schizophrenia, so I, so I know that's been a challenge for them, but and. And we knew him since he grew you know from a little boy and. um but you know, I was, I was felt wow you know I you know that's a lot of challenges for Julie and. But I kind of. didn't really understand as well you know."
748.0,Provider,"yeah it's very consuming. Very consuming of people's lives and well being. so forth, to have somebody in the family with severe mental illness like schizophrenia, but I also hear that your compassion has been heightened for something as normal that we don't tell me see what is often present as Depression and anxiety. And that is so much more pervasive since covert yeah it is, it is a main a normal mainstay of people's experiences it's quite remarkable white."
15809.0,Patient,"yeah and one, so you know my father passing away that's a predictable thing I mean you know every everyone's going to pass away sooner or later right but coven you couldn't predict. The fire we couldn't you know, and so I think that's really what war on is the stuff I couldn't predict, you know. um. And I think and then so also when I started feeling, you know. Not myself that scared me that it's like well if it's this easy to go down this path for me and then that's why I started feeling scared and guilty that maybe i'm doing this to my husband, you know that i'm causing him to have. You know that it could happen to him too, and then we'll both you know both be not well. In a mental health way so."
748.0,Provider,it's hard to acknowledge how vulnerable we really are.
15809.0,Patient,"So I think for now i'm just enjoying enjoying life, you know and. I. I can honest, you know the surveys that we do before grew so you know now I can honestly put that you know i'm not thinking of hurting myself because. I mean, I guess you're the one I can tell this to that after I got back from the hospital um. I did practice putting a plastic bag over my head. So yeah because I kind of thought pills, and a plastic bag, maybe would have. been you know I after I got out of the hospital, I was kind of mad at myself that I failed. yeah so it's kind of like well here's another thing to put on my failure resume is what I thought. um but now i'm kind of like like I said i'm so glad I didn't succeed, and I have to accept that there's a part of me that didn't want to."
