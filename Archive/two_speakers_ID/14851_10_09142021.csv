10.0,Provider,"Okay, so. let's see what else is important. Is there anything else that that you think I should know about you, to be able to provide the best possible care."
14851.0,Patient,"um. No, not really but pretty much covers it all questioning questions."
10.0,Provider,"Do you want to I feel like it's probably best if I don't start a medication, right now, because you're about to go to detox and i'll probably. If it's an Inpatient program they'll probably. You know check you out and decide what kind of. medication, you need."
14851.0,Patient,I said okay.
10.0,Provider,"Yes. So and i'm not sure if you even want medication, but."
14851.0,Patient,that's really. herbs.
10.0,Provider,"Okay. So will will will. table that for right now I think probably the most important thing. Is. to remember that. As you're getting off alcohol, the, the best way to succeed is one through self compassion. not getting down on yourself realizing that the. You know the alcohol was serving something maybe you do have some type of schizophrenia psychotic issue. But obviously now the alcohol is not sustainable and it's getting in the way of you doing what you want to do it, which is be the best that you can be so now we just have to find another way to. to manage those symptoms and to replace the alcohol with something. that's that's more helpful and sustainable."
14851.0,Patient,Okay.
10.0,Provider,So what kind of things do you do to take care of yourself.
14851.0,Patient,"I want you to shower wash my clothes I go to work, I do the wire and thing I wear jewelry. I write a whole lot. songs i'm thinking about certain a couple of books."
10.0,Provider,"Okay, so you're a writer and a musician."
14851.0,Patient,"Yes, and then the jewelry artists and."
10.0,Provider,Artists right. Do you do any exercise.
14851.0,Patient,I did until my life became too filled with other stuff. I used to exercise and meditate every day. I did I just haven't found the time for it.
10.0,Provider,Okay well now you're going to be.
14851.0,Patient,able to. quote one of the buddha's does if you don't have time to meditate for an hour to you should meditate for two hours.
10.0,Provider,"I like that. yeah I meditate every day and it's it's a game changer, so I think, maybe with this Inpatient program you'll have a chance to kind of pick back up on your exercise your meditation really increasing your your fluids, water, you know because you're detoxing in many ways, right now. You know your diet, trying to eat as clean as you can."
14851.0,Patient,"Does that make sense to. me last do a complete mostly out of my diet, no try to use this organic stuff. Okay, great I still eat some me but. it's organic."
10.0,Provider,"Okay, so I you know I think you're already on the right track, do you want to make a specific goal around either you know the meditation or the exercise or something to support your health during this time."
14851.0,Patient,"yeah, I would like to meditate for at least one. hour a day and exercise for half hour to."
10.0,Provider,"Okay that's genius all right, so one hour meditation and. meditation and one and half hour, what are you going to do Walker."
14851.0,Patient,Oh. No actually i've gotten.
10.0,Provider,At the.
14851.0,Patient,"gives you these different things to do, push ups crusher is. jumping dress all kinds of stuff Okay, there is a gap card. number is roofing. I didn't really have to do that. My job was there, we go."
10.0,Provider,what's the name of that.
14851.0,Patient,um. I don't remember the name of. Red it's red and it's got a guy doing push ups on it.
10.0,Provider,"All right, i'll take a look. Okay right on so sounds like we got a plan for moving forward. let's see. Do you have any other resources to help support your sobriety. or."
14851.0,Patient,yeah i've got i've got definitely i've got some friends that are very supportive of me getting sober. Because they've had glimpses of the real me and they want to see the real need full time right.
10.0,Provider,yeah I think. yeah exactly. What do you think the alcohol was serving for you.
14851.0,Patient,um I use it as a numbing agent basically like when I was three I was kid not molested and. Like kind of. The views to. hide from my past I guess.
10.0,Provider,Okay yeah so so maybe maybe some ptsd huh.
14851.0,Patient,"Yes, definitely."
10.0,Provider,yeah okay. we're kind of. Like if you're not drinking what kind of symptoms come up for you that that that you're trying to numb from.
14851.0,Patient,"I just I start thinking about the futility of existence, so everything means nothing. and Like I just think about like just the horrible things that happen all around the planet. stuff that i've never witnessed myself personally, but I know that there are some really messed up stuff that happens out there and I think about that."
10.0,Provider,And that's just so painful it drives you to know now. Yes. I can understand.
14851.0,Patient,"I think about. What happened to me, and I think like there's people that had so much worse."
10.0,Provider,"well. I hear you and I know that that is very painful just the the awareness of all the. trauma and the pain that exists out there. But have you one thing that I found helpful is if I when I when my mind goes to those places is to just. use my concentration to shift the focus to all the people that are out there, trying to trying to help those people. Trying to prevent that stuff from happening, trying to you know heal the planet trying to do good work and just remember that for all the. pain and evil that's out there there's also an equal amount of people working for good, and you know. yeah trying to so sometimes that that can help me get out of it so just just a thought that I would share with you when I."
14851.0,Patient,"When I left my hometown St Louis I actually traveled sure six years reading for. Trends to try again and all that. went. To standing rock. And I helped out there, building rooms building buildings and then I went from there to sable trail pipeline and mako notion of a line. Three with the ojibwe. To cheyenne reservation after the. trenton like i've helped with food shares food not bombs oh. feed people consider myself to be an impromptu on the street counselor in over. People that nobody else is going to go talk to. yeah so you go this guy's dirty and Harry and. Go talk to this guy."
10.0,Provider,hey you know that's that's. that's beautiful work I command you hates know. Think. So I think yeah I mean that might be a way to to help you you pull yourself out when you when you get into that pain.
14851.0,Patient,"i'm sorry I had a phone call coming in and it muted, but I believe you're muted, no."
10.0,Provider,Can you hear me. Hello. Can you hear me.
14851.0,Patient,Still.
10.0,Provider,Are you there. Okay. Can you hear me I can hear you.
14851.0,Patient,Can you hear me. I can hear you. Alright cool so yeah.
10.0,Provider,"I can hear you now, so I was just saying it might be that you already are aware of you know all the good work that's going on from your travels and it might just be a strategy to pull yourself out rather than going to the alcohol. To go into service to go into. Remembering that there's people out there that are fighting the good fight and trying to help out, and you know what else, what else is there to do and it sounds like. really what i'm hearing is some a strong motivation with this baby, you know the rot in the world, and you want it sounds like tell me if i'm wrong, but you want to minimize the trauma to this kid and try to bring them up in. This possible way, so you got your work cut out for you. In a way, and. I think that will."
14851.0,Patient,"also go. I got four plates that are overflowing onto the table, I put all that food there, though."
10.0,Provider,"that's right, so you got it, you know self care is the key, and we can work together and group, and you know it's sometimes it's helpful to have other people. You know that have been through it to. You know, be in Community and another great have you heard of refuge recovery."
14851.0,Patient,No.
10.0,Provider,"I think that would be a good fit for you, with the meditation peace refuge recovery, if you."
14851.0,Patient,check.
10.0,Provider,"them out online do you have a way of writing that down or putting it in your phone refuge recovery. Okay, great so yeah I think. That. It would be a good place to start, I mean you're going to be in this Inpatient program congratulations on creating giving yourself the space to. really focus on dealing with this and you know you get plenty of time now to meditate to exercise to go to groups to get all the support you need calling it in and. I think that you know, however, we can support here at bright heart i'm. i'm with you."
14851.0,Patient,Thank you.
10.0,Provider,"Alright, so um let's see any do you have any questions for me at this time right anything."
