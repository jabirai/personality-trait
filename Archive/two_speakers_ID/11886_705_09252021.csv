11886.0,Patient,"awesome I went. Last week, and she told me, you know I don't think that you need to come. And at first, I was like alone like cared and I was like no, I think I told me to call and then I started thinking about and I was like well that's really good if she's feeling like. i'm a progressive enough to where I don't need therapy, then I should embrace that and I feel so scared and nervous."
705.0,Provider,"hmm absolutely. And you have worked with her when you were like this, so you, you know."
11886.0,Patient,"yeah it's like she was like she like made me think of all the things like when I first went there why I told her, I was going, and she was like as one of the things was like I had no self worth. And she was like do you have you know she was asking me how I felt about myself now and I was like no I don't feel the same way that I did when I went in. And she was like the and then it was just like different little things are like my need to always be parsed day and things like that those. Things that she pointed out, and she showed me my progress, and I was like Okay, and then you know she reassured that always go back if I knew and I knew that I go to so i'm pretty confident that I could transition from therapy with her."
705.0,Provider,"yeah absolutely Susan and you know this is this is your choice, and you have options so for right now yeah. You got what you came in for I mean self esteem you're already like okay. In the event that you feel like you need you know, sometimes people say the tune up or the maintenance maintenance, then you go you're able to do that, but for right now. You know you're working with my heart health to to keep it still when when you feel to like hey i'm getting even busier with what you're doing now. We want to support you of where you are so you know i'm going to leave it to you like right now I know we have twice a month when you feel like that you wanted to look at something different, we can do that."
11886.0,Patient,"Okay well it's good to know you know that I have options and. i'm full I just I feel a lot more confident now than I did when she brought it up to me, because I kind of don't take things easy, the first time, like. If you come you broke, something you gotta be prepared, I might be a little I might be a little good upset and once I think about it and I realized what's going on, I could think mostly so now I think smoothly. yeah confident in the decisions that we're making with the therapy and. You know and it's also good to know that went, since I am getting a lot more busier that if we we could talk about it when that time comes, that makes me feel confident to."
705.0,Provider,Absolutely Susan and and again to to hear you answer about the self worth and that today you've rebuilt yourself worth and where you are it's like. That that just right there is like. anyone's wish for someone in therapy.
11886.0,Patient,"And I did I didn't realize it like before she had brought it to my attention I didn't realize that my self worth had changed. You know I just kind of been going about life and fixing things and working, I never really took the time to stand back and say. I do have a lot of self worth now that I didn't have before and I don't feel so insecure and so put down and just so beat down by life and things I don't feel that anymore, but I didn't realize that until she talked to me about it."
705.0,Provider,"Absolutely, and he wouldn't have known Susan because when we're in crisis as human beings, we almost just bury our heads and just making it day by day, you know so it's it's good that you reached out for help when you when you could who's there with you."
11886.0,Patient,What is my puppy bell. I don't know how to come on baby. My hearing dog and this one is sugar.

705.0,Provider,"And that's the attitude, you know that then just continues, where your self esteem, is there you're able to take things in stride it's just like when you make a mistake it's like yes we all make a mistake that's how we learn and grow from it's like okay."
11886.0,Patient,"yeah. I don't think if I didn't have my medication I don't think that I will be able to be as calm, as I am, I think it really like it, I don't know what it does to my brain but it kind of like helps me stay level. And then that helps me think logically because i'm not My first reaction isn't anger, which before that was always my first reaction with with anything you feel some soda I was so mad I was yelling screaming just so frustrated. Nowadays, when I take the medication if he's still a thought i'm just like oh okay that should have been something helping you with my anger really helped me."
705.0,Provider,"it's just like with high blood pressure, if you take high blood pressure and we know people turn to anger to with the high blood pressure, going up. You take a minute and medication to bring it down it's not going to disappear, the same thing with the medication you're taking it just lowers it to a level that it's more healthier for you."
