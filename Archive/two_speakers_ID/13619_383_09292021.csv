383.0,Provider,Hello. Can you hear me.
13619.0,Patient,I can.
383.0,Provider,"So I have a very basic question for you, and that is I forgot, do you like, to be called Tom or Thomas or what is your preference."
13619.0,Patient,So I don't have a preference it's never mattered so. Whatever is clever lot of people call me Tom my friends call me Tom cat that's a bit informal. Thomas Tommy really am. it's all good.
383.0,Provider,"Okay, I have a very, very dear friend, whose name is Tom his father's name was Tom and his son's name is Tom. And so you know there, I think that his dad's father was also could anyway, they have Thomas the third and the fourth and but anyway, he goes by Tom I can't Tom but I always think your name it says, Thomas so i'm just kind of like inclined to call you Thomas."
13619.0,Patient,yeah right so that's fine. Like I said. dealer's choice.
383.0,Provider,"Okay, thank you. So how have you been and what would you like to use this appointment to. discuss if you if you know."
13619.0,Patient,"Oh, so I have an idea for that um yeah lately i've been in pretty good, and I have been slashed slipping behind on the my workout a bit um. You know just with the weather and stuff I haven't been as busy with work and it comes and goes like that, with the weather it's it's they're completely tied with each other. So. I haven't been that productive at work. I don't know, and I just can't seem to get motivated to go to the gym lately. But i've been my mood has been pretty stellar lately."
383.0,Provider,Oh that's good.
13619.0,Patient,"yeah and still kind of like recouping from the the little friends celebration, we had for our friend that passed and. yeah."
383.0,Provider,How did that go.
13619.0,Patient,"It was fine first time i've seen a bunch of US friends and since the beginning of golden really. yeah and we've just kind of like shared stories about our friend Jay and. yeah it was good, it was I was kind of apprehensive beforehand, but. glad that I went but yeah it's just I know we've talked about it last like two times but man hot that. This has just been terrible absolutely terrible. What I wouldn't give to just have my friend back. But um I think what I wanted to talk about is my we can dig into my family about because I don't talk to my family and. yeah, especially since the election my older. i'll just see the rise of trump ISM. it's become impossible to talk with my dad in any aspect just about i've seen him a few times in the last since San Francisco but really. And it just we can't have a conversation, without them, turning it like deeply political and. I don't know sometimes we've definitely grown apart pretty. Pretty thoroughly before because of that, and even before them but. Now I just can't I can't talk with them it's like. I don't know if it isn't. it's, just like the best it is to find it is just like the trump isn't like the blatant kind of in your face disregard for. Other people's that kind of zenith phobia and overt racism. And stuff like that and it's just something. I really try to avoid. You know."
383.0,Provider,"So I. plan to ask you some things just maybe to get a little more clarification. Sure i'm just about your past with him from what I recall, when we had our initial meeting you. your mother was not doing well and so your your father was you mainly were with him after their divorce. and If you if this trump situation weren't here or this you know rise of the. What Conservative or you know, however, you want to call it, but. What would you like what kind of relationship, would you like to have with your father."
13619.0,Patient,I mean. that's what i'm having a. trouble answering I tried to reconnect with them sense and. i'm. yeah after it's just hard to relate with them anymore. Like we can't. And i'm not exaggerating it's like we could be talking about anything. And it comes back to something that's just. yeah it's it's always political. No matter what I tried to do. Is he.
383.0,Provider,"Is he, like is he glued to the media. he listens to kind of starts to happen to people as they fill their. Time with."
13619.0,Patient,"media. i'm not exaggerating he listens to conservative radio all day long like he wakes up he stays at his girlfriend's house at night, but it usually is that his house. during the day, and he has like a little machine shop and he works on cars to you know as a hobby. And he's retired but it's like I mean he wakes up he leaves his girlfriend's house he's listening to conservative radio. He gets home he goes to his bedroom he turns on conservative radio he goes down to the kitchen radio into his workshop radio and then at the end of the day, turns it all off to turn on the. Radio in his car to drive to spell friend's house and it's just like I watched it happen after I was diagnosed with cancer. We were expecting horrendous medical costs, so we got out of the rental agreement, we were in and my dad invited us to stay with him for a bit while we kind of got things balanced out. And I just like I watched it, it was like we would have conversations and he would just be. Like word for word repeat repeating and I don't know if that was conscious or not, but things that he had heard on the radio. And it just became inescapable we could just we could be talking about. Anything and I would just come back to a lot of those talking points and i'm sure you're familiar with, whichever side of the fence you're on and it's just."
383.0,Provider,"Not on the just be clear right here, I am not on the trump. fan so."
13619.0,Patient,"Right yeah and it's just like a became impossible, it was like. My fiance is an Argentinian immigrant and we're talking about why people should like we'll have a conversation about um and I go to the hospital and then i'm going to stop to grab lunch today and, like Oh, but that restaurants, run by illegals probably and it's like. yeah it's driven a wedge."
383.0,Provider,"and Sometimes people listen to those. You know they're on that the radio and they're they're into that media because of just a sense of needing company and. kind of loneliness and particularly people that are retired they'll be like. You know out working on their car, I noticed this when I was living in this place, I was living in before and. kind of rural but I don't think it just happens that's where I think people that are retired a lot of time on their hands, so they turn on these radios and they and they literally fill their minds with but it's part of it is for company."
13619.0,Patient,right that makes sense.
383.0,Provider,lonely and.
13619.0,Patient,"You know I saw him lose some of his lifelong friends older man like my dad's like 60. i'm gonna say like around 67 is born in 53 but um some of his lifelong friends, he doesn't know chat with them like I ran into one at a restaurant before it goes it. Was he you know he's mentioned he wasn't talking my dad anymore it's like he's he's just isolated himself, you know it's not as a lot of very extreme beliefs now and. yeah but you know I just like. Being with show silly my fiance she's we've been together like I said almost a decade 2022 will be a decade. And it's i'm glad that she was so patient with me for such a long time because. You know, after my mom moved out and now i'm living with my dad my dad worked, I mean just all the time, and he was just said, a man, you know, a very emotionally cut off kind of baby Boomer man not that that defines the generation, but you know that type of masculinity. And I just I was never taught to be able to express myself very well emotionally for the longest time and it took a lot of patients and a lot of hard thoughts if. Anybody feels like fiance just like i'd been for a while I didn't know how to express myself at all, it was not a skill that I was taught. You know, and my mom was just gone so I didn't really like but between like the kind of. absence of emotional support on my dad's side growing up and then not having my mom around pre I mean she was around for a bit, but not like in a capacity, you know, in a healthy capacity at least. And between both of that I realized, I have a lot of abandonment. kind of issues that go along with that. And my my dad was really strict really strict and. I think that's also kind of contributed to like anxiety and stuff like that in my adult life."
383.0,Provider,What kinds of things with your dad strict about.
13619.0,Patient,"How things were to be done, I. Always saw I had a lot of choices which I don't think is a bad thing, but. Because of that, I didn't have much of a social life is like even Saturdays and Sundays, it was cleaning all day or. I I got punished, a couple times and like I just feel like be punished veil is so above and beyond. There was a couple instances I got in trouble, and he ordered third trucks to put dirt on our driveway and then. I would have to move it and set up the garden in the backyard, but this is like an entire dirt truck with a dirt. And me with a wheel barrel, and it takes me three or four days eight hours a day, you know, to move some of this stuff and it was just brutal brutal brutal brutal, so I I because of that I just kind of became very quiet and I didn't want to make noise and want to you know. i'm. kind of like slinking around my own house growing up for a long time trying not to cause any waves."
383.0,Provider,Right right. um if you he's aware of your health situation if you're.
13619.0,Patient,"Yes, and for a long time he just was absence absence of any emotional. Any empathy or anything at all, it was just. For him just to kind of pull yourself up from your bootstraps and get back on the saddle kind of thing in as much as I would like, for that to happen, and I feel like it has happened now but I mean. He wanted that to happen in months after me dealing with this and it's like well first off my I don't have a thyroid anymore so for the first like year they were just trying to balance my hormones. And so there was a long period of time, where I was not controlling my emotions like. It just made me feel like shit constantly it was like it was like. Similar to like manage costs or something i'd have like hot and cold flashes my emotions were all over the place, it was just. yeah I I just didn't see any empathy from my dad and that aspect."
383.0,Provider,"Did you ever address that with them, whichever saying gosh. You feel anything here."
13619.0,Patient,"yeah I did, and I did and. he's a very hard at it man, and I know I am too, but it was just like dude all I need is just a little the tiniest bit of understanding, like, I thought it was going to die. So, all of a sudden, all my. hopes and dreams and everything has just been turned upside down so you know, all I needed was just a little bit of understanding and that after his diagnosis and living with them, it eventually caused an argument, where. I called up an asshole I was like look a like I just like i'm explaining to you, it was the one of these arguments is like I all I was asking him for it was for some some understanding, a little bit of patience, you know as we adjust to this new life. and yeah he wasn't having it and I call them and our soul and that that blew up. Okay, so that was a just said, get your shit and get out."
383.0,Provider,"Now wow so that's when you left his house, so there was like a fight or blow up and then you left."
13619.0,Patient,Right yeah.
383.0,Provider,"Okay, so that's like a you know sort of recall, you know rupture in their relationship around that event and then has there been some reparations made since then."
13619.0,Patient,"A little bit, but. yeah we don't really talk much and that situation we haven't had that hard talk, I honestly i'm like apprehensive to have any. conversations that take any type of like introspection. Because I just feel like i'm going to be beating a dead horse kind of thing. Are that's not the right analogy or metaphor, but you know what I mean I just feel like I don't have a lot of hope for the situation to be honest."
383.0,Provider,"yeah yeah well I think that's circles back around to what is it the to. want I mean do you want to have some kind of relationship where it's just like you check in how you do in did you, you know, have a nice Sunday, we did. Take care. That kind of you know, have some communication to Steven on the most basic level or do you feel like you don't want to have any communication or."
13619.0,Patient,"At times I don't but also it's like I don't know he's still my dad but he's like this, so so incredibly difficult to deal with. um I don't know like I might say hi to him on a text message, or something every. Two or three months really insane from him but it's not nothing more than just you know hey how you doing. kind of thing, but I mean, as far as the answer, what I want I don't know. I think. I don't know. i'm kind of. upset with them that are you."
383.0,Provider,"Still upset about how he treated you in relation to what, when you got your diagnosis and is that what you feel most bitter about."
13619.0,Patient,"recently. yeah and. I don't know my so to go even farther back. After my parents divorced, when I was still a kid my. dad gotten to a relationship with this woman begin my step mom and. And they weren't together, but for. A year or something that she found a military Academy for me to go to. And so I got sent away to this military Academy. For five years did a through 12th grade there. and I mean, there was a lot of positive to it, but also i'm just kind of it just felt excessive honestly. And then, once I graduated and then came home the step mom left like within six months, so like she just found a place to get rid of me pretty much. For about five years and then, once I was back in the picture, then she went off and left and i've seen it happen with a couple other girlfriends with my dad or he's it just becomes like them like his partner at the time, you know what I mean. And it's. kind of came out on me feeling a lot of neglect in our relationship overall. And kind of bitter about that honestly I always felt like I was on the backburner my brother's 14 years older than me and he he had my parents around the entire time of his childhood. You know didn't have all this bullshit. He had all of his needs met and. yeah. I just feel totally different than my dad or my brother I don't know what happened, but I broke ranks and what a different direction with my. Who I am."
383.0,Provider,"But emotionally you you sense I mean you just expressed that you felt kind of neglected and not attuned to and. kind of abandoned, I mean if you were sent to like a military school. Maybe you thought it was kind of fun at the time, but maybe there was that sense that you were being sent away from the home."
13619.0,Patient,"yeah one one side graduated and I was that's like literally six months later, she was gone, I was like oh alright she's the one that that found the place to enroll me there and then, once I was back in the picture you know so it's like. seem very obvious to me."
383.0,Provider,mm hmm.
13619.0,Patient,"I good not that it was all bad because there's a lot of good things that I learned there. yeah but you know, again, it just destroyed my whatever social life that I did have. Back at home was just you know decimated."
383.0,Provider,When she ended up leaving again.
13619.0,Patient,"Well, just from going to school and and different you know 1500 miles away."
383.0,Provider,"yeah yeah definitely. your attachment was kind of you know just not very strong or just constantly sort of put. There was stress placed on it, I mean there's stress placed on your attachment when your mother left and then. So you don't. I mean imagine you don't really have a strong attachment to your. to your dad and. His life, you know and now he has a new. girlfriend and he's into this other thing so. You know, to build a sense of. Community and attachment I think you're going in the right direction of like you have friendships and you have your partner, and you have this this home that you and this life that you have with her and. You know just staying focused on that and and recognizing it's really that it's very valuable to you because it's almost like you, you you weren't given that when you were growing up."
13619.0,Patient,"yeah um yeah definitely i've. I feel like chosen family is really important for me, because my family is like if the family that I do have outside of my dad everybody lives out of the area distant cousins and stuff that I haven't seen since I was an infant I wouldn't even remember seeing him. So my sense of family is just really. it's not really there all too much and then with. And I just barely scratched the surface of that but, like with how strict my dad was. And some of that I appreciate, but it's like. He was trying to make us like. Being my brother both completely independent and self sustaining and I appreciate that, in a lot of aspects but it's also. With our relationship to I think you made a really good point but it's it's yeah it's I don't feel a need or a want or anything from them and part of that is because of how self sufficient and independent i've become. ya know."
383.0,Provider,yeah.
13619.0,Patient,"it's like at some points and just like well why Why am I feeling this way all the time, like yeah I mean i'm sure i'm to blame because I don't feel the drop to keep nurturing this relationship, but also you kind of created this monster and me as well, so."
383.0,Provider,"um. yeah so that any tender. leanings towards attachment, he was. Training that out of you, in a sense, by trying to make you more independent and which is a value that. Many people have you know, especially in America. So maybe even more like white America. White American men, you know tend to be really sort of low on their own and. Sometimes at risk for being really lonely, so I think that building your family or having a sense of for asking yourself the question about you know what is family mean to me and what do I want to create in terms of family, you know."
13619.0,Patient,"So yeah show see will be finishing school. Three and a half semesters from now, and on the last semester we're gonna start trying for a kid so that way we can start our own family unit, you know. I think I have a lot of good tools to not be of my dad to my child."
383.0,Provider,"yeah yeah you're going to kind of create your own family, based on what you think is valuable and important and building that social connection from a different you know it's a different era to you know and. You have the opportunity to create what you want. There still might be those moments where you're when you're in reflection about what you were. What you didn't receive and how that's still somewhat painful. Maybe, or maybe you might feel really fulfilled by what you create."
13619.0,Patient,"do well we'll see I. Know whatever expectations, I have of that are probably going to be shattered so like. good and bad you know what I mean like I don't think there's any way you can predict with grade accuracy what. What things are going to be like, once you have a kid."
383.0,Provider,And you're already kind of creating it with you know your relationship with your partner and your friends and like more emotionally available more emotionally expressive man in the world with your friends. and your partner and so you're sort of stepping into. A different. Being a different kind of person than your father.
13619.0,Patient,"yeah I hope so. yeah. yeah and I don't know what to do about that man and I I guess part of me just feel kind of guilty, but at the same time I just don't care enough to foster a relationship. yeah feels kind of guilty, but it also just like at a certain point, I just want the bandwidth. You know."
383.0,Provider,"Well, I think that you know you can set certain parameters around okay i'm if I do have communication with him i'm going to be really. i'm just gonna if I didn't agree with trump talk i'm just going to say I disagree and but I but dad like how are you, you know what did you have for dinner to to have your favorite roast or you know I mean try to get to the other things that aren't. talk politics, you know."
13619.0,Patient,"yeah yeah yeah I feel like some of it, it definitely is his age and then loneliness. yeah isolating makes it makes you anti social you know."
383.0,Provider,"yeah yeah and then with the company of the of all of that talk is just because that's literally the company that that these people have is their radio, you know blasting. And I don't know, maybe you could suggest you know I have you seen you know your friends lately like it's it seems like you're me you be the emotionally open person."
13619.0,Patient,"Though the last time I was talking with him, I was trying to. Very subtly urged him to speak with a therapist yeah no."
383.0,Provider,"yeah. I might be a good, a good thing. You know I had a complicated, this is not to turn the focus to me, but I had a complicated relationship with my father and. I just couldn't stand, you know some of his ways and attitudes and I still some of the things that he said, make my jaw drop. But I would just sometimes I would really challenge him, you know and. I remember once he's passed on now, but i've got very we would get in these tussles that would be I would felt like I was 16 again, you know and he's in a nursing home and all of a sudden it's like where we're headed and what we're locked the horns, you know just the way from back then."
13619.0,Patient,"It becomes that dynamic of elder and child, you know it's like that that's happened with we do have it's like but i'm not a child, I am your child, but this is well, this is not how people speak with each other."
383.0,Provider,"Well yeah you get into these old patterns and I remember like storming out of a nursing facility and i'm just like. I can't believe this is happening he's in a nursing home and i'm still having these like similar like fights and so anyway, a couple of days passed and. I think, just one day pass and I called and I was really upset and I was crying and I was just saying why you know why you do this and. And then I talked to him the next day, and it was funny because he had dementia, so I was surprised that he remembered and he said you were so upset you were so upset i'm so sorry you're so upset and I said well. You know, we just this happens above them and he was like what the problem is it you and he said, maybe, the problem is with me, I have the problem, and it was really an amazing breakthrough, because he was a very hard headed male like no one, I am always right. You know I never admit my faults and and yet. The persistent and being like authentic, I guess, in a sense, on my part kind of helped so maybe you know with. In measure you know, because if you do that overly the person can blow a gasket and you could have them, you know people can get really angry and then there's health risks involved with that."
13619.0,Patient,"Right right. yeah. yeah and. yeah, I feel that, to my my grandma his mom had dementia, I know, towards the end she she kind of became quite bitter and very mean, I think that you know part of that just comes with dementia, like you, aren't really in control of."
383.0,Provider,yeah.
13619.0,Patient,You don't have the same capacities emotionally and whatnot.
383.0,Provider,"yeah but why you still have the opportunity. Maybe you just want to. When you do see him be really candid and just say you know dad you know. I love you but you're really tough, you know you're like a tough nut not you're so emotionally shut down, you know, but I. I don't know if that feels appropriate or not, but."
13619.0,Patient,"yeah I think. The you know it's something that i've been known to do, but just. I don't have that strength when it comes to talking to my dad you know I do what I can a lot of aspects of my life, to be frank and try to speak, what I feel but. Not a dynamic of that relationship, unfortunately. it's one of my weaknesses for sure."
383.0,Provider,"It can be really hard to confront your parent or to even. Be. Like that you know, to speak to speak truth to power in the sense. Because they do hold that there is a power thing that is going on there."
13619.0,Patient,Right right.
383.0,Provider,yeah.
13619.0,Patient,"yeah I don't know what to do and. I noticed something one of my really close friends years ago passed away. and i've never been able to wrap my head around it, he fell asleep, while taking a bath and then that was it, it was apparently sober and everything and I kind of always question if the intended it or whatever, but when my friend passed. You know it's really, really sad and flew across the country to go to his funeral whatnot and back then, I was talking with my dad a lot more, and he was really kind of devastated to and. And knew how much this person meant to me, and all that stuff and then, when my friend one J vaughn passed in June, and I was over dropping off some tools for my dad and. He asked me how things are going, and I just kind of like just like word vomit a bit, and I was just like my. Self and i'm like I know i'm here physically, but I am completely devastated and like I don't like i'm doing everything I can i'm taking the steps and need to start speaking to a therapist says, try to unpack some of this stuff and. You know, he asked me who he which friend of mine and I showed him a photo he's icon and you know. It just. I was talking to him, like a week or two later and Dave on gave up, and I mean I was still just completely devastated and. He was just so incredibly like off standish in and like unavailable completely it was like um you know pretty much Tony is like man, this is really. really taken a huge toll on you and pretty much telling me that I should get over it. And you know, with all of his his political beliefs and what I was like I bet, it was because Dave on was black like I don't know if it was cognitive or not. My other friend that passed was white and Jay on my friend that passes a black man. i'm just wondering if he's expressing Barry prejudice and racist things to me before and like you know he's probably just tell me to get over it, because he doesn't respect this person as a as a human, you know. Like that it just it doesn't do anything to help, let me respect the man anymore. You know Jay Yvonne was a very, very important person in my life. And uh you know my dad's my blood family my brothers my blood family, the json was my chosen family. And so you know, I think that says something you you're assigned your blood family, but if you have somebody that's so important to you that you choose for them to be in your life and the capacity that a family member would take him that's you know."
383.0,Provider,"yeah. Well, that must have been. I mean that must have been very."
13619.0,Patient,disappointing.
383.0,Provider,"Why yeah and kind of. kind of a turn off, I mean I just like Oh, you know. to feel that that racial bias just even if it's unspoken."
13619.0,Patient,"it's funny to me too because, like he's half the time and have Spanish and he was complaining about people come in here and not learning. English while they live here as like pots like it's great grandpa moved here from siddeley Sicily and never learned a word of English his entire you refuse to because he. Americans were they didn't have the family values like the Sicilians I was like Oh, we got to stop it you're being a bit critical like our family again be okay for people in our family to do it and then you're like oh no but those Mexicans, you know it's like oh Lord."
383.0,Provider,"Right right. Good conversations to have you know I mean. We it's good thing to have a conversation with the old. values and and. And challenge them, you know and still stay. In connection as friends. yeah. I mean, as as people as human beings, I think that that's part of the you know, one of the part of the problem is that people are getting so separated and they're not connecting as human beings anymore. Right and. Keeping that. Open that's like I care about you, because you're just a fellow person, you know fellow person, although we don't have the same beliefs, but it's very difficult, I hear you."
13619.0,Patient,"yeah it's like I tried that especially while living with them after I was diagnosed because that's he was diagnosed October 2018 and then we stayed with him for about eight months eight or nine months before things blew up and no I mean I definitely try it is like. just trying to have simple conversations and every time it just turning political and it just became impossible. it's just impossible to not talk about politics and it's like it sucks because, like what you're saying just. increases this division this division as like yeah at a fundamental level I don't believe a lot of the same things that YouTube, but we can you know, like you, are my dad so it's it's definitely something I tried. But definitely tried."
383.0,Provider,"Staff well continue, I think that did not close and not really a big believer and just fully closing doors unless there's just been ongoing and continual abuse. just leave the door open and and if he text you text you know text back and try and keep it on the human level, you know the exchange."
13619.0,Patient,yeah that's pretty much where we're at right now. yeah.
383.0,Provider,"Are you how are you doing with regards to just do, are you okay with shifting the topic or."
13619.0,Patient,Know it's good.
383.0,Provider,"Okay, and how are you doing with your been stopped drinking, are you still working with that."
13619.0,Patient,Not yeah it's been just over a month now.
383.0,Provider,"Okay, good. So the the gym and the the exercise and the motivation to do that, do you feel like that's just you know temporary and you pick that back up."
13619.0,Patient,"yeah it is I. I just keep putting it off, you know and. I just need to get myself over there, and a lot of is because I start with Cardio and I just need myself to death, with Cardio and then I do some weightlifting and so maybe not beat myself up so much with the Cardio. You know, maybe go to the go to the gym with the intention of just lifting weights and.
