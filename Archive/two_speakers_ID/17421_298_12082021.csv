298.0,Provider,"Okay, and that's quite a while ago uh do you have a psychiatrist or a. or a therapist. No okay your insurance would like you to meet with a provider, like myself, to make sure that you have a plan for your mental health. We can offer you our program our program is, you see a therapist about every other week and you do that on zoom just like we're doing i'm not the therapist i'm that more of the person who writes prescriptions gifts diagnosis, as those sort of things. that's one part of our program the other part of our program which is required is group therapy, that is done one hour once a week. And then, of course, you have access to prescriptions with me, are you interested in a program like ours, or would you like a referral to a psychiatrist or a therapist."
17421.0,Patient,I just. received a referral from a colleague of mine in pasadena area so i'm setting up a consultation there soon.
298.0,Provider,Okay that's awesome how are you sleeping right now.
17421.0,Patient,"we've been pretty decently All things considered, I would say averaging it's been a lot better maybe nine hours a day, so it's great."
298.0,Provider,That is great how How was the medicine working for you.
17421.0,Patient,"So far, so good i'm trying to be conscientious of when I take it that was one little question I had for you they're recommending in the morning. i'm in the hospital they're passing out the medication at night, so I haven't made that transition I didn't know if it would be bad to miss a day and then start in the morning. But a little bit of an upset stomach every now and that it might just be because of the lack of food, so."
298.0,Provider,"it's okay if you're going to do it like that to miss the 12 hours or whatever you can to get you on yourself on the new schedule um. How was your anxiety, if you have any exciting."
17421.0,Patient,"um yeah I guess the holidays wouldn't be helping necessarily. it's probably average, six, seven."
298.0,Provider,"Okay, and six or seven is average for you that's that's."
17421.0,Patient,"it's not good, but."
298.0,Provider,Okay.
17421.0,Patient,No vacations coming up at two weeks off and i'm hoping to reach around zero there's probably a to.
298.0,Provider,What do you do for a living. What kinds of therapy.
17421.0,Patient,of marriage family therapy.
298.0,Provider,"Are you a marriage family therapist. Yes, okay and. Is it stressful."
17421.0,Patient,yeah.
298.0,Provider,"We like is I was just reading an article I wish that I knew where I put this I was flying in the airports and in the magazines they had this. magazine called mental health, so I picked it up and I actually bought it and I was reading about the shortages of therapists right now, and how the wait to get into see them and i'm like Oh, my goodness i'm stressed just reading the magazine. what's going on in the industry. Okay, how would you describe your moods."
17421.0,Patient,"moods. gosh I would say moods overall are consistently happy joyful responsive. Towards the end of the day, they get more drained exhausted, not enough energy to even entertain a conversation with my wife so. weekends are glorious since there's no work and they can turn off that started the mind."
298.0,Provider,"Now, will your regular family provider continue with the lexapro."
17421.0,Patient,"Later regular family provider oh my doctor. yeah i'm. Potentially or i'm wondering, should I search for a psychologist locally around here."
298.0,Provider,"you're not on i'm like if you have a relationship with a provider already that would that would just be easy, he would have no problem, giving you lexapro properly. But if you wanted more in depth, then I would look for a local provider a psychiatrists."
17421.0,Patient,okey dokey.
298.0,Provider,"psychiatry gotcha um what are your stressors in life, other than your job."
17421.0,Patient,"Other than that. I would say just maintaining a certain level throughout the pandemic. trying to figure out what the future is going to look like with potential kids where we're going to move what that even looks like moving, there was the whole licensure process and that's very stressful as well. Parents are getting older, but again outside of my control it's not a big stressor but it's something i'm conscious of. Aside from that maybe just overall self feeling of wanting to lose more weight wanting to have more energy."
298.0,Provider,What were the circumstances around your admission to the hospital.
17421.0,Patient,"So that was let's see on the 17th I was entering into take licensure test at a panic attack in the middle of that and that consumed 40 minutes of the time, so I timed out of the tests came home a little notionally distraught. De escalate the situation with my wife talk through it there's a lot of hope and then I woke up in the morning and was just. doing what i've always done even since I was a kid there's this blanket and I wrapped around my neck like a like a necklace there was tension, but it left a mark. So granted with the escalated state previous night my wife my concern contacted my therapist and the therapist initiated a 5150 over that G and contact me there was no communication on it so. I had already previously made appointments through bright health I know that's you guys um site wellness wellness psych and had an appointment set up there, because I knew I needed to get some kind of medication change something here so. yeah and then spent five days in the hospital."
298.0,Provider,Do you have any questions about the medications you're taking.
17421.0,Patient,"Not necessarily unless i'm missing something any side effects, I should be aware of."
298.0,Provider,"um number one reason that people don't take that medication. And not that it's very high, but just to be aware of is decreases libido and that just makes people mad so by keeping it at a lower dosage you you run the risk of running into those problems because the. Side effects can be dose dependent, it can upset your stomach but that usually goes away within a couple of days it won't do that. What it's doing in your brain is giving it some serotonin which puts up in little film. Like a cushion a covering over your serotonin receptors so that they're not so exposed and there's so much anxiety that's one thing that Sarah tone and does. When you see a psychiatrist he may say yeah serotonin is good, we need to raise those levels, but for some reason, you are have such a stressful job your dopamine levels went lower. And so that's what a psychiatrist can kind of do for you, and maybe that's more than you wanted to know but that's. what's nice about lexapro is it's one of those meds that that plays nicely with anything any other medications it doesn't have a huge side effect profile, but it is a serotonin medication we run like 80% of our serotonin is in our stomachs and so when you give a serotonin medication. Yes, we wanted to get to the brain, but first it's got to go through the stomach there can be a little weight gain with serotonin medications not everybody has it, but that would be a possible side effect. You look at it this way, you may only need to be on this for like six months yeah your brain has started to heal from the stress of your job or whatever it is that kind of got your levels to go a little I happen to like and I don't know if this interests you. braver man assessment, you can look it up online and it teaches you about neuro chemicals and that's how we that's how I prescribe is i'm looking for symptoms that match the neuro chemical and then you know which medication to give based on that so if that interests you."
17421.0,Patient,that's absolutely thanks for that.
298.0,Provider,"um are you feeling suicidal having any suicidal thoughts. No, have you ever attempted. suicide. No Okay, do you have any family history of suicide."
17421.0,Patient,"Oh gosh cousin on dad side. 22,002 maybe."
298.0,Provider,"Okay. Okay, any medication allergies."
17421.0,Patient,to sell sell.
298.0,Provider,"Okay, what happens when you take that."
17421.0,Patient,i'm not too sure was a when I was a baby in the parents said you're allergic.
298.0,Provider,how's your ability to focus.
17421.0,Patient,varies on both levels of interest and involvement overall pretty good.
298.0,Provider,"and your short term and long term memory. Do you have any abuse or trauma in your background and, if so, you don't need to tell me what it is just say the type and about the age."
17421.0,Patient,Of. Sexual 26.
298.0,Provider,Have you had any hallucinations or delusions.
17421.0,Patient,No.
298.0,Provider,"None, and I, you know what those are okay and. house you're eating."
17421.0,Patient,"It could be better, I think, with the back to back 13 hour days I only have one meal, but i've been really diligent about cutting back on clients on getting in at least two meals now, which is great."
298.0,Provider,Or you paid per client or you paid.
17421.0,Patient,For quite.
298.0,Provider,"Okay, and are you working from home or in."
17421.0,Patient,The in the office.
298.0,Provider,"In the office so you're on long days i'm very long days sorry about that, but I understand. i'm right there with you i'm doing 13 hour 14 hour days. yeah I just took a vacation I take a vacation about every three to four weeks. And that seems to recharge me and I have a lot of things that. I tend to be a person who believes in that stuff for the love languages. You know. Little and I know what my love languages, if I want to fill my own tank i'm really big on affirmations I mean I can just like. So I have these little buttons that I got on Amazon. And when I get done with a client I may press one of them and. Did you hear that. Just silly little things sums are closed some stuff and i'm just like telling myself your number one."
17421.0,Patient,"No it's so good to hear, though, because they've never really teach that at all it's always go go go, but I would love to take a break every four weeks, but I can't just do two weeks, once a year, I think that's what scared me this pandemic."
298.0,Provider,"yeah yeah I I I cut down to the bare minimum it doesn't mean I completely stopped, but I it just happens that I seem to be taking breaks and I need it because, like you get a lot of people's secondary trauma on you and. yeah definitely yeah i'm right there with you um everybody who's in this field has got to be feeling it yeah. Is there anything that I can help you with."
17421.0,Patient,So I guess the thing when it comes to prescribing the next medication reaching out to the GP and having him follow through and that's that's it.
298.0,Provider,"I can give you because you've met with me once I can give you a month of that prescription, so that it gives you a little bit more time."
17421.0,Patient,that'd be wonderful.
298.0,Provider,"I do, like the choice, by the way that they put you on I think that's a good After talking with you, I would do the same."
17421.0,Patient,"So i've done it back in 2004 I believe was when I started 2005. And you're right a couple months and circumstances changed and just naturally came off it there's no there's no plans on ending medication, but far down the line, if i'm feeling better how would you suggest."
298.0,Provider,"I would cut it the tablet in half, and you could do. A week of it being in a half and maybe a little bit of a quarter and then be done. If you wanted to do it faster, you would do it. Every four days go down the House."
17421.0,Patient,okey dokey.
298.0,Provider,"If you were to just stop it, because you didn't have the medicine, you would be looking at discontinuation syndrome that's basically feels like the flu."
17421.0,Patient,rough okey dokey.
298.0,Provider,"So if you know that you are getting low and you haven't found anybody to replace it then make a plan, this is how i'm going to get myself off, but it's serving a purpose, right now, of letting your brain kind of. Re heal just a little."
17421.0,Patient,okey dokey.
298.0,Provider,Okay you're good to go. Thanks for wanting to meet me.
17421.0,Patient,"Alright, thanks take care bye."
