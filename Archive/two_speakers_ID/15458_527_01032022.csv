Okay, and. yeah and then I So while we were talking was like on the phone too, but then I mean I was like in mental in my hand I was just like okay like until the end of holidays and then i'll. kind of drift away from this, I think, on December 30 we were like on the phone and then he I saw him that he was on hinge. So I was like Okay, I mean like he always told me that, like you know, he was conversing you never. He was we were only dating like each other, like has been. Seeing each other only but like if he wants to covers he would be conversing with other people. But I just didn't know he was on edge. So I saw that and I was like okay like you know, I was like okay you're curious you do want to see like what's up and stuff so I kind of was like okay like. I told him I was like yeah like I saw you on hinge and then he was like yeah like you know, like we thought like we're okay with conversing and stuff with like other people and i'm like okay like I just wasn't aware of that, like you're on a dating website you just not like. Just conversing with. Just people you kind of already knew or anything like."
527.0,Provider,Okay sure.
15458.0,Patient,"i'm like I don't think it's because i'm like if you let's say, if you like someone. I mean like i've been you want to start dating is all like never there's there's nothing like serious public, but like with the other woman is like i'm not seeing anyone i'm not like you know i'm only seeing you and i'm like I know, but if you do like someone could eventually."
527.0,Provider,go into that.
15458.0,Patient,that's how me and him that to. Like on an online dating website okay.
527.0,Provider,"sure. i'm like you know, so you know how they kind of work yeah, in other words, look at where we are, but."
15458.0,Patient,"You know that's how we met so like what can he's all like I would let you know, though, like, if I were to date, someone i'm like yeah but where does that leave me. You know what happens to me at that process, while you're you know talking to multiple people, but then suddenly like you show interest me know you like someone or they have more you know they grasp you're interested stuff. I would just have to do what at that time. You know I would kind of have an effect on me and he's like no I would never like you know would want to stop you and stuff out, and I want you to like you know do your thing too. And everything was like Okay, and then like the next day he called and he's like I don't know why but it's like making me feel kind of physically sick think about that you can talk to other guys and stuff. i'm like yeah that's kind of how I felt yesterday. yeah when I you know saw that and then he was like no, but I can be the one to like. hold you back to at the same time from not talking to other people. Because I know that, like you know me and you don't have that you don't have a kid and I know that's not Okay, on your end or like your family to accept and all of that, and I know how much they mean so like it doesn't. As much as like what I wanted to be as I don't want you to talk to other people and could have a relationship where we could go further and but for what it actually is because I like I know that there's no, you know I know that it's a dead end and stuff. I mean it's something like. i've been knowing in inside and everything to it's just he has a better way of Vegas."
527.0,Provider,"yeah what's the what's that what's that feel like. For you, because it sounds like you guys are starting to have a little bit deeper emotional connection with each other."
15458.0,Patient,"it's like we, I mean we there was like a connection it wasn't me yeah there was a connection, but I always knew that it was gonna hurt. got like you know when we you know I like blitz always knew that we weren't going to work like it wasn't gonna be like it wasn't gonna go till the end but it's like you know we liked each other, but we knew that like. On the far end future. That it wasn't that wasn't a pig and I do remember telling him like or an arranged marriage he's like you know it's hard, knowing that there's no future to it. But having to say like I love you or like you know you know invest and like do things for this, but then, knowing that there's no future, you like it's a hard core, partly doing that, like you know, having strong feelings, but the knowing that there's no future to it."
527.0,Provider,yeah yeah what are your thoughts on that.
15458.0,Patient,"yeah I feel exactly the same way yeah it's hard like it is hard it is tough to like be like okay this, but then the reality of the situation is you can't. You can't have this so it's. it's a struggle, but. You know i'm just you know, sometimes we just yeah so i've been I kind of told him that we met for new years and stuff but I told him the next day that like I just kind of wanted to focus on myself Warren just you know get my studies out of the way."
527.0,Provider,Because I believe that's what ultimately would make me happy.
15458.0,Patient,"Okay, so that's what I told him and I haven't talked to him and apart, like a day and a half. And I mean it wasn't supposed to like go into like some breakup thing that i'd say that, but you know, I was just like this is what I kind of wanted to do first I was like okay like i'll get back on hinge and like do this, but then I just thought like you know there's so much I can like. I feel like I need to heal from this and just let all the emotions and like whatever I feel let that let them feel instead of just like be like okay this happened, and then like just bring another person and then you know divert all my emotions into that. And then never even. letting myself feel what I felt here. yeah so like you know. that's what I mean that's how I took on it, I don't know if that's the right way to take on."
527.0,Provider,What what all feelings are you having about about this right now I do yeah.
15458.0,Patient,"I mean, I feel bad it's just like sure do or I mean it's, not that I expected a tour. it's like I guess I didn't think it would hurt as much. But it did her. yeah there was attachment and then. I guess I also I guess kind of like having to find out that he was on the hinge because I think I just kind of expected him tell me that would be on which I think that part hurt. Okay being completely honest Okay, and to find out the way I found out just sharing oh like he was. Like you know, he was we were faced me through iPad and he was on his phone. And then i'm like oh like you're on hand I didn't know that like Okay, you know."
527.0,Provider,And stuff so it's like so were you on hands trying to see if he was on hinge.
15458.0,Patient,"No, no, I saw him like just texting. Okay, like it was like face timing and let's say like you were on your phone and then I saw that you're texting on hinge. Like if I was like this. Okay, and then I saw that I know how he looks. Okay, so I saw."
527.0,Provider,"him so it so it popped up on yours, or you, you could see his phone."
15458.0,Patient,He could see I could see through all. The.
527.0,Provider,Time gotcha gotcha. Okay.
15458.0,Patient,With that. Because I know.
527.0,Provider,What are you doing on there if you were upset that he was.
15458.0,Patient,"saw it like this, like i'm on the off. So, like how i've been doing that it's like I just kept the APP on here, and then I just see people who have like like me that's it or like you know, like people who like do, but I have never made a conversation with people so."
527.0,Provider,"yeah that would kind of that would that would hurt, knowing that you know he wasn't completely upfront. And then. And then probably wondering like how long. Has he been on that, like the whole time or."
15458.0,Patient,"I think he's been on it for about like maybe like three weeks or a month, if I see the time scale on how it's been I think it's been about a month, I think he found out his exercise one was on hinge. And I remember, he said that to me because has X because that's who he has a kid with. Okay, and then his ex con live, because I think she's like makeup or something on their shirt I gave him a hug and there was some of my makeup was on a shirt and she thought that she got mad. or something and then I think he found out that she was on hinge and I think that's what made him. go on. not like. Day, but like at least to converse because I think there's still like. baggage on like. I guess I don't know how the I don't know i'm guessing because, like, I remember this one time you just be like I want you to live. Your best life if you want to see other options, you could he did tell me this part this one time, and I was like well it's so random why you telling you this. is like I don't want to hold you back kind of thing, but I think this was the same time he made his account, which dates back to like three weeks one month, and now the same time, he told me that has X goes on. But she got mad that like. He was seen other people or something. yeah yeah it seems like a very. Like a lot with what's going on there, so i'm."
527.0,Provider,sure.
15458.0,Patient,"Sure yeah, but I think this is probably I don't know."
527.0,Provider,"I mean, how are you feeling with some of these barriers that may come into. play in relationships just with family stuff and cultural stuff because I know that's and you wanting to explore dating options for yourself, and you know and. Does do you feel like that's limiting your options, and you know, limiting your ability to find emotional connections for you, for yourself."
15458.0,Patient,"yeah I do feel like that is the thing because imagine like if you. didn't have any limitations, then it's like you're free well to do anything but i've also realized like dating someone that has a kid. That has that their acts as part of the picture."
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
15458.0,Patient,And that's something I learned through this.
527.0,Provider,yeah.
15458.0,Patient,You know. cuz like originally when we started it was like she wasn't in the picture. And then she kind of came into the picture. And then. The part that's like I guess that makes it worse is that she wants a relationship. And he doesn't like he's like yeah totally transparent.
527.0,Provider,Like.
15458.0,Patient,"He doesn't want anything to do with it he's kind of there just for the kid, but I think she wants with the kid. kind of thing. So I think that's also like that's like it's it's disturbing because you know me and him have to spend time it's kind of like up to her and when she wants. He when he's allowed to see that kid so it's like when he's allowed to see the curriculum it's like oh like and then it's like i'm in my my schedule has to be around that and I was like. This is so new to me because i've never. dated someone. Had that happen to have traveled. So this was, like all you shiny. surface to me. show that, like okay like. This is that so like it's kind of in her hands when. What you know what is a lot of what is now. And sure, so that that kind of made me feel kind of like a little powerless, as in like you'd have no, they have no say in it, because you know the kid comes first so like it's like yeah so one thing I learned is probably like. To date, someone that doesn't have a kid I think i've. learned through this dating experience at the moment."
527.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
15458.0,Patient,"it's tough. it's tough having to. Having do like having to share, but then like it's not just you're not sharing it with the time, but then like having someone that's like was important to their past. And like important to all of that it's still it's kind of you know it's a lot, I feel like I have like crazy amount of like emotional maturity and be like no insecurity of all to like you know go through all that but. that's something i've just learned."
527.0,Provider,"Well, you know i'm i'm glad to hear, though, that you are open to you know at least X exploring this relationship, like that didn't totally like because you've got a child, I don't want to have any. You know any connection at all like that was know that you were trying to just develop a healthy relationship with somebody for yourself."
15458.0,Patient,"yeah yeah I think I was pretty open minded a moment. yeah trying to be like Okay, this was something in your power. we're going to put it i'm like i'm like okay like um yeah."
527.0,Provider,"I can I name it, you know it is yeah I think it is very challenging when someone has has a child or children. Because you do have to you know, probably take some extra steps and really understanding the dynamics of that relationship, you know where where are they really with like you know visitation and relationships with each other, you know is that you know. And, and because some can be totally different, you know as far as you know, this is, you know whether they were married or divorced, you know or. Just a girlfriend boyfriend or. You know there's definitely a lot more dynamics when there is a child involved have better understanding the relationship."
15458.0,Patient,"yeah it was a lot with a lot of things. That i've learned, I think it also. helped me become more patient. Just be like okay patient really like just being open minded about it and stuff because I know a lot of people. don't want to be a part of that or like take that upon themselves. And stuff and I guess I could say like Now I understand why. They don't want to and stuff. You know. it's not the person's fault, you know, this is something that happened. They thought they could make it work or work at one point. that's what they thought and it didn't work. doesn't mean people don't get like a second chance of life for like. TV or anything."
527.0,Provider,How are you feeling about yourself in this.
15458.0,Patient,"This I just I felt like I was to giving I was to patient and I felt like. It was, I think that's one thing i've learned is like. I remember like when we were when we initially started taking his just like you know I really want someone that can pass like pure kind of love and affection and I remember getting excited over that because I felt like I had a lot of that to offer. Okay, so I was just very like Oh, I am that kind of person that has that pure form of like you know. not available, but then I didn't realize I think what I realized is like I also want that. You know. Sure, like when someone says like yeah like I want to be loved and I wonder how like affection, I was just thinking oh my God, I have so much of that to offer because i'm that person that has like the pure intentions of it, like, I just want to be genuine, but then I realized like. You know I it's like I was giving him this relationship, and he was he was you know, trying to make the best of it. And then you know it's just like I just felt like I could have I could have. As many times like I could have probably received more, but I was just being patient with his situation. And stuff. You know i've always been the one that's you know people told me that, like i'm like sometimes when people say oh you're too Nice or like you to giving you two empathizing. And i'll make sense now. it's just like I am too much of that and, like I need to like. realize that like I I also need that because i'm like you know yeah cuz i'm not because i'm not happy at the end of the day, just kidding, even if that makes me feel good. it's just like i'm i'm also i'm afraid i'm forgetting, I think I think I forgot that like i'm also supposed to receive. You know or and stuff I always tell myself this because i'm always like oh my God people take take it for granted T people take it for granted, and I feel like my ex kind of did that he was this guy wasn't like I. wasn't yeah yeah not like not like in a toxic way or anything. It wasn't like that, but it was just like. there's like a line that needs to be drawn. it's just like Okay, you can. Do this much and also like. I don't mind doing it, I think it's just like I would also, I think I forgot that I need to receive all of that."
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
15458.0,Patient,Back I. was just.
527.0,Provider,gonna say what's difficult about receiving it for you.
15458.0,Patient,I think that lets me be me even more vulnerable.
527.0,Provider,Okay.
15458.0,Patient,"If that doesn't make sense. yeah and I think I can give. And let the other person feel the emotion and everything and feel happy and everything, but I think i'm also scared that if i'm like. You know, or maybe I think sometimes like if you're. You know and. I feel like people would do it if they want to do it, you know. It shouldn't be like a demand thing you know how they say it's like the guy should know you should get flowers I shouldn't tell him to get an hour. Like you know, like there's like means and like. yeah kind of jokes that like it's like the guys like hey do you want flower it's like no you're not supposed to ask you that love flowers she just gave me five or something I don't know it's kinda like that, where it's like. Should I don't want to have to say things, I just wish people would just think of like. Doing certain things, or certain actions and certain you know."
527.0,Provider,So read read my mind.
15458.0,Patient,"read my mind, or like not even read my mind it's like just wanting to do it because I just feel like I just do things. From like thoughtful i'm just like."
527.0,Provider,"Okay, like sure."
15458.0,Patient,"I was like we met up for Christmas, I was just saying okay let's have a bottle of beer it's Christmas with ice cream and Indian he was black and he was us until like beer and he wanted to know about Indian beers before new year's I just got like. You know Indian kind of beer it's very small things but it's, just like the thought that goes into it. that's share my. You know. Not even like materialistic stuff I think like you know just wanting to spend time or. anything like that. that's like i've just realized I need to I don't know if it's put it on like some people say you're supposed to demand thing that you should want things and you should say it out loud, so the other person understands."
527.0,Provider,"woody, what do you think about that, like at least you know letting the other person know what your needs wants desires are in the relationship, instead of trying to guess or assume that every girl likes flowers when. Not every girl likes me, you know, not every girl likes flowers so. yeah and i'm particular on the flowers, I like like so he's."
15458.0,Patient,Like yeah.
527.0,Provider,"You know, to just to get to know somebody you know to. really understand them, I guess."
15458.0,Patient,yeah I think I always just wait for the guy to do the first move. yeah I don't know if that's a problem. You know I don't know if that's a problem that like.
527.0,Provider,"Is it is it a problem for you, does it cause or does it cause problems for you."
15458.0,Patient,"It seems like at the end it's causing like everything's done on like oh shoot okay. Maybe I should have just you know set this or maybe I need to voice myself better, and so I think there's also like I think I feel scared. That if we voice our opinion about our opinion, but like anything like that's very deep conversations. But how can I do with a relationship I think i'm also scared that they might be, or something."
527.0,Provider,Because this will be too much for them.
15458.0,Patient,Too much for them.
527.0,Provider,"Too much because that's what I kept hearing from me in the beginning, like to to giving too nice to this to that to be. Like."
15458.0,Patient,because to me if I have like a deep conversation it's like.
527.0,Provider,Okay.
15458.0,Patient,"And this really connect can do I come off as i'm being too much further. or like extra or no, or like it's like Oh, these are the you know or going into like details about certain things it's like am I supposed to Am I crossing a boundary here, am I supposed to not ask these questions. Am I supposed to stay mute. And I make this person feel uncomfortable me asking a question about this. You know it's kind of yeah so. yeah."
527.0,Provider,Okay.
15458.0,Patient,"yeah there's that or like yeah or even asking too much it's like all right, am I asking for too much of my mouth and like demanding too much in this thing."
527.0,Provider,"You know what would too much be, what do you in your in your eyes what is too much."
15458.0,Patient,I mean that's very broad like too much in which aspect to.
527.0,Provider,"In a relationship, because it sounds like that's something you question like if I asked this if I do this if I say this. You know what is. What is too much that you think would someone would walk away."
15458.0,Patient,"going into too much of their personal details. Okay, are asking about their. into like day to day life, I guess, like we're asking oh like you know, like there's people who are like oh Where are you who are you with or like I don't I don't really do that. I don't I, for me, I just feel like there should be enough trust, where I shouldn't have to ask you. kind of just what I think, but I think there should be, also where the other person. You know, you know, like when you're too easy on someone. you're just too easy on them, I think that's me like i'm very just okay. Just TV and I don't know if that's a problem or like to just chilling or like just naive in a way to where it's like all like what could they possibly be doing i'm like it's fine like there's no reason for me to like asked to do something like create a situation out of this, you know. Just never ask. or anything like that."
527.0,Provider,What if you have like a gut feeling though db do you ever have like a gut feeling like something's off and I need to ask or.
15458.0,Patient,"um. yeah sometimes I think I just avoid the gut feelings. And i'm just saying. Just. kind of go with the flow not this one in particular because this one was kind of like we weren't in a relationship, and we were just you know exclusively dating but like not in a relationship so. There are things that like I just didn't like, even if I thought I just wouldn't ask if I did ask you to tell me that she would tell me, and there were saying that he just told me how to ask. And stuff which was nice, which was. Just being transparent about things. yeah just I. don't I just don't I don't I don't ask that's the problem. Because I feel like at that. Ask or even like what I want in a relationship I just feel like i've always told me well you're so you're so nice your understanding, if I don't want to be understand you know. Thank you, that i'm understanding, but like I don't really want to be understanding, you know and stuff because I just feel like if i'm understanding that's just me kind of. Being understanding, but like are you really are you are you being understanding of me, though, like about how I feel i'm understanding of your emotions and i'm able to do this for you and still be like still be mature about it and go forward with it. But then, are you be are you doing the same, you know, are you being understanding about my situation too."
527.0,Provider,mm hmm. You know.
15458.0,Patient,"yeah because, like if someone is being understanding wouldn't you wouldn't you think for them, and just be like okay like this is making them uncomfortable I would not do this, you know or something like that. Well, I think. yeah someone that's like that's what I think sometimes it's Like you, I took a personality test, because all are all my friends were taking the personality. Is underground underground thing. And then I was, I came up as like Type two, and it was like deeply empathizing loving and all of that, and so tired of sleep."
527.0,Provider,"And that's what I was gonna say I think you, you know are much more in tune with that for yourself. yeah and so sometimes sometimes it's hard not to. think that other people should be that way as well, and so you know it is challenging that for yourself. To like you know. Okay."
15458.0,Patient,yeah sorry.
527.0,Provider,"that's okay. So for you, it is, it may be having to speak up more initially with what you want to see in the relationship to because it is fair to have your needs met to, and not just sit back and stay quiet two things when you feel differently about things."
15458.0,Patient,yeah.
527.0,Provider,"And sometimes. Sometimes guys need more direction. You know, and sometimes girls need that to you know i'm not saying it's. All you know we have to educate men, but it is you know there's a lot of empathetic men out there, too, and they need direction from women that they're in relation, you know, like you know how do, how do we balance and and meet each other's needs."
15458.0,Patient,yeah.
527.0,Provider,mm hmm.
15458.0,Patient,"I I think I honestly suck out a. hardcore on how. To say this because it's just like, how do you come off saying like yeah. I just I just I just want to be like, I just want to have like the genuine form of love like to I was listening to a podcast and and this guy was just saying like. How he always used to do like short term dating because he's like engagement fall apart, or something and he's like you know when he was 27 his engagement fell apart and he's like that's usually the time everyone starts to settle down. And you know, for me, and the same thing kind of happened to me too. And were like I broke up broke off a long term relationship it's like. you're happy that it's off your shoulders because you've got to have something toxic. But at the same time you feel like it's a failure because it was something that you're supposed to accomplish at that point at that. Time and. So it's like a it's that's exactly how I felt at that time. And it's yeah it's kind of yeah it's. it's like and then I was doing all short term relationships from them, I tried something long term, but like I was kind of happy to without either."
527.0,Provider,But.
15458.0,Patient,"It was all short term I don't know if i'm actually running away from this like you know and then he was saying how like. You know I realized that I realized, how come, I am not letting myself. be loved you know. Going into short term things thinking okay i'm not going to get hurt from this. yeah it's a short term thing. I don't have any expectations, because, like you'll have expect once you get into something long term, you have expectations right. And then these expectations aren't met met and then, when they're not mad like and then you get hurt and then that's exactly what we're trying to. avoid you know these expectations and then these expectations aren't met and like that's how you're wanting so that's why we keep going into these like things that are not going to be serious, because you don't you're just so cautious about getting hurt or."
527.0,Provider,not willing to risk that again.
15458.0,Patient,"And not wanting to risk that again and i'm just. i'm just figuring out like how the hell i'm going to do that because i'm 29 and i'm just like I just not and I just feel like that's not a good stage to be in because it's like you want to date, but then it's like. It doesn't seem like I can it seems like it's going to take a lot out of me to be because I remember, even this guy was just like you know someone else going to be with you they're gonna have to really be patient with you and I was like. yeah. They do they do I feel like they do and I don't know if the other person deserves that they're willing to be patient."
527.0,Provider,So what made him bring that up. dbs like why. They need to be patient with you.
15458.0,Patient,"Because I think. I said I love you but it's like I love him for the person he is not because I was falling in love, maybe there's times, I felt like I was falling in love, but I loved it for the person who wins and. He said it like. I think, like a month or two months ago, but I never said it back, and I was like i'll say it when I want to say it. When I feel like at the right time, and I think that's what he said, like you know they just have to be patient with me and i'm okay with be patient with you because I care about you so it's okay. i'm Okay, with it, but he was saying, like people would have you know. They would have you know the person you got David just. The person you get past to be transparent with you and patient with you because I like whatever they tell me is what i'm taking him. i'm trying not to like. Be so over analyzing about it and ask, and I think he knows that because I just think I just take what he tells me i'm never asking too many questions, sometimes i'm just like Okay, this is what they're telling me just believe it because you know."
527.0,Provider,This is my shirt. So now i'm. not trying to like make it not true what they're saying.
15458.0,Patient,"yeah not true, or like if they're telling me something i'll be like okay now that's not that's this and i'm just listening and i'm like Okay, but i've never like. Like I question and I asked him, but I never go likes so deep into around like questioning trust and things like that, because I feel like. You know, trust should be there, but like if there's something that if I see like if I see it, and i'll call it out what I saw the hinge thing I called about. You know, told him I was like yeah I just I kind of like was like okay I gotta go and then I thought about it for five minutes, and it was on the 31st so I was just like. proud of it first the 30th and i'm just like I really want to like you know pick up something and like make it like a bad new years and, like you know the dates itself. Like should I do that or, should I not do that and stuff but I was all like no I need to do this, I need to face it, and just tell him doing that, instead of like waiting for like a week and, like talking about it and talking to him as if everything is normal. Like me, having to put like a fake front. Even though it's bothering me and annoying me on the inside. it's better to just you know I guess rip the band aid. Can just put. shy just call them five and five minutes later like haley I did some. stuff, so I will ask when I see it, but you know I think in my past to every time i've asked it kind of turned into like it was my fault somehow or like it got into a really big argument. You know there's a there's a time my ex like got a call from this one goal that used to like him and I. asked him about it, and then I said something and i'm like Oh, how could she call you and stuff and then it's just like oh you don't trust me, you know kind of thing. Or you don't trust me that this was going to happen or like you don't you think i'm doing this, you. Do yeah and yeah."
527.0,Provider,Basically flipped back on you versus acknowledging what he was doing.
15458.0,Patient,"And what the problem was, and I think i'm still. yeah I think i'm still like. Like when you ask too much or when you say too much it's just like you're just scared how the other person is going to react okay. yeah yeah. that's. that's that's how I feel I don't know how to I don't know how to work on myself to do that, where I have to be more open and should be. Oh that's also like that's a that could lead to hurt right when you when the person doesn't react, the way you. hope that they would react for like at least like you know, try to understand why you're asking this more you know if they're doing something and that's why, like, I feel like for me morals are so important, because I feel like I. Have like. high standard of morals. So it's just like I would never. cheat and like you know, or like do those kind of things like I just don't see myself. Being that person. Like they kill himself would eat me away if I did something like that. Yes, I think it's just like I really like i'm just always very like you know what I wouldn't do this I just hope I find someone who has morals like that, where they do such things because it's like yeah. it's hard you never know because those are all things that are hidden. Right."
527.0,Provider,yeah and you know I What would it be like to have a conversation with somebody about their morals and ethics and guide you know kind of guidelines for themselves. Does that asking too much in your eyes.
15458.0,Patient,"No, I think I think I think I made that pretty clear room with men I day seriously i'm always like you know. i'm always like a person is going to achieve just leave a relationship, and you know I also tell them i'm a naive person, so I will take what you're going to show me so it's up to you, and trust is so important, so it's up to you to show me what you like you know. You have to show me that there's like trust and all of that, if there's no trust. i'm going to leave I don't want to deal with that. stuff is by making pretty like little white lies, you know. I don't mind. it's whatever everyone does like lies like you know I could be doing like small lies and stuff, but when it comes to like strong things like that it's just like. You know I I don't see myself. Being doing doing that. And she. yeah I never had a conversation about like normal, but I think, but if if a person talks to me they'll understand like in the conversations come up, and you know, like i'll be like oh never be okay with someone cheating on me like that's just not something I would do to them. I don't see why they would do to me. So i'm making I don't have like a specific conversation just on worlds, but like as you're getting to know the person you understand right they wouldn't do this."
527.0,Provider,"They do you ever hear it from them, just to clarify it like you may share it, but do you ever hear it from them where they stand, or are you just making connections, based on things that they're saying."
15458.0,Patient,"I just made can actually things are what they're saying I don't specifically say. Would you ever change anything, I know I guess I wouldn't say."
527.0,Provider,"Well, you could play what what. I want to your right, as he would just say yes."
15458.0,Patient,"Because that is the. The difference of that is that is the answer that girls are going to want to hear. Okay i'm like yeah i'm gonna cheat you know. I would say, maybe I would. I mean no one would say that you know you're like what's the relationship wasn't gonna go well, I might cheat obviously i'm not happy, I don't think that's something like a guy would address took rolled up their dating. Even if that is the reality of the case, you know. yeah yeah."
527.0,Provider,"It may yeah. So maybe the approach would be you know what what are your feelings on that, like would that be something like that would. yeah. come across your your thoughts, if a relationship wasn't going well, or. You know how would you handle it if somebody did that to you like, I wonder if, maybe open the door some you know, in that way."
15458.0,Patient,"yeah I do see that I remember asking the guy that was sitting on the couch with your wife cheated on you would just stay with her it's like no I wouldn't do myself like not like okay you wouldn't do yourself like that, but would you cheat on the wife, though. You know, would you do that because you're at the same time, if you're not happy, in your relationship, would you not do yourself like. yeah where you're in an unhappy marriage, but then you're really you're okay with cheating. yeah but you're not okay with your wife cheating on you know what i'm saying there's like double standards on some."
527.0,Provider,People sure sure yeah yeah yeah I gotcha yeah.
15458.0,Patient,yeah it's weird I just yeah I don't know how to be this like not empathizing not. I think.
527.0,Provider,I don't think you're going to ever be that way.
15458.0,Patient,"Like. Oh God like I just i'm just like this is so much i'll just like I don't want to like I feel like next time i'm just ready to like I want to be the selfish person. Where I want to take all of it feel it I recently like went on a day and not a day we met with friends and she she brought her boyfriend alone, and you know they're just like little simple things that he was doing and stuff they were. So cute and I was like and she's always been in like just short term relationships. And, just like short term hookups and stuff never like had a solid relationship, and this is the first time she's doing that. And just the way he was treating her like small it's just you know very small gestures, you know that go a long way. yeah and stuff and, like the way he was looking at her when she speaking, or like just like how enlightened me like when she says something you just seem so like they've been dating for like about six seven months now. But it was so cute and I was just like oh that's so sweet, you know and stuff. So it's it's interesting it was good to see you man."
527.0,Provider,yeah.
15458.0,Patient,"I was like Okay, when I want something like that sounds really, really cute."
527.0,Provider,I was gonna say how would you receive that How would you allow yourself to receive that. and make yourself a priority.
15458.0,Patient,"I don't know I don't know how I would I don't know how I would receive it, it would be nice because it's been a long time, I felt that kind of love. You know shone upon me like I felt it what the guy was dating like when we're outside sometimes and stuff. or when he was you know and stuff but like. I think it was just it was just like it's been a while, where you feel where you feel so so secure and just like okay this person really. Does love me or like oh this person really. does give a shit or this person really cares about me. And stuff. there's been times, I felt it with him, because I was dating. But like. You know, knowing that there's no, you know it's going to be a dead end it's a different it's still an emptiness you know, because if there's no like really but it's kind of. it's kind of nice to have that may go into the future and progress into the future and can go towards something serious and marriage later and all of that, I feel like there's like a different sense of. You know there's a different types of security and like. and letting yourself feel all of that, because you know that, like you can let yourself feel that. And you don't have to be so guarded that like Oh, since this isn't serious I can't let myself feel all of this because i'm going to get her at the end of this anyways. yeah so. yeah."
527.0,Provider,"So, how would you know you can trust yourself, then, and not question everything. To be able to receive."
15458.0,Patient,"I don't know I actually don't know. How I would trust myself, because I have made mistakes in the past, you know."
527.0,Provider,"I know because that's what I was thinking like you have really. You really question every like am I doing this right, am I too much, am I to this and you know. What what did I do you know versus you know where the accountability really needs to be placed. You know, yes, you may have your part and piece of it. But not taking all of it on for yourself."
15458.0,Patient,yeah.
527.0,Provider,Do you deserve it.
15458.0,Patient,I think I definitely deserve it. Okay yeah.
527.0,Provider,Good good.
15458.0,Patient,"yeah oh yeah I feel like I definitely deserve it just cuz like. I don't know I just feel like I have so much to give and like. All of that so it's like why wouldn't I deserve it like i'm not a. Bad person i'm not you know I don't buy intentions aren't bad. i've never. i've never leading on someone that you know if they feel like they have like a future and how these plans with me. And you know I never. I never I never thought. it's. Like I just I I do think like i'm a i'm a good person and i'm like I can you know I. I feel like. It gives me, it gives me a pass to feel like I can deserve. But. yeah cuz I just see a lot of like you know I just think people around relationships and I see what their husbands are like how they feel and like. relationships and i'm like I don't want something like that i'm like I don't know I don't know if it's I don't know if there's something completely wrong because you know you do start. Self doubting yourself oh it's something wrong with me, or is there, like something I need to change about this or. What is it like i'm Am I am I in the wrong place, I might not taking Am I not seeing the right things, am I not doing the right things. might not like or am I not pretty or like what is it where, am I going wrong with all of it, am I, like you know, because it makes you start doubting yourself again. You know. You know, even now, like you know him being on hinge you know, he was telling me it's like an exercise that him and his friends to just see how different girls react to different things. You know how they're talking about so they take these conversations that he talks to his friends about it now these conversations with these woman. Not like with me, but like these woman and they just kind of like let's go like this, but like what the hell dude kind of like you know they kind of do that, but they just they're just seeing how like the dating scene is outside unhealthy girls are and stuff. And it's just like okay you're very curious about it, but then it also makes me think like. Am I not like was i'm like you know, I was being so patient with you and everything's going on, so like was I was I not want where where where where did I go wrong with this."
527.0,Provider,Okay.
15458.0,Patient,"Is what i'm like you know thinking why he wanted to go back on hinge and stuff but then I realize it's because I understood why because because it's X was on him and he just needed to at that moment feel like to. Admit that part, I guess, maybe understanding it made sense. It."
527.0,Provider,"doesn't make sense, does it make sense, though."
15458.0,Patient,"Because it makes sense, on why he went but it's just like were you supposed to do that, you know, like. yeah you know. But."
527.0,Provider,"yeah I think it's I you know, I think, for you it's. You can put the pieces together and understand it, but does that make it okay."
15458.0,Patient,"yeah does that make it okay. Is that okay to do and I said to him and I was just like. I don't think it's Okay, for you to do that, because this is not fair to me."
527.0,Provider,"Because actually that's what I was going to say like it's not Okay, for you."
15458.0,Patient,"it's not right yeah yeah yeah. i've mentioned that I was like this is not fair to me because, where does that leave. You know it's not cool and and that's when. I think he realized that like okay like I need to let her go like as in like it's it's she's allowed to do whatever she wants she's a lot of talk to men are like not allowed, or like whatever, but like you know you can. she's. She could do that it's tough. But it's yeah but, honestly, right now, I think I just want to focus on getting my education together instead of like going in back into the dating scene and finding someone again and then like you know not feel these emotions, I think I should just love these emotions be felt and then."
527.0,Provider,"yeah I think giving yourself time to process this this loss, you know it's it's a lost relationship and there's grieving that goes along with it, it may not last as long as other losses, but. But it may you never you know you don't know what the process is going to be like and what you're going to discover about yourself through through this and giving your time yourself time to do that I think is great yeah. yeah yeah."
15458.0,Patient,"yeah yeah. I would say, like I think even cutting off all communication with him would be better, I guess, I don't know."
527.0,Provider,"What do you want to do, but."
15458.0,Patient,"I mean, I feel like if you call it would pick up and talk normally but I don't know if I could keep like seeing him and stuff because I feel like that's just going to surface the feelings and everything again and I would have to go through the process of. Being and then also realizing oh like he's also talking to other woman. You know, but i'm not going to talk to other guys because I just don't want to I don't wanna I. don't want to be involved in that. yeah but. I don't know I don't know how it is how I don't know how it is it's like you're flirting with other women to text put them like. Your exclusively to me when we're like seeing each other and like talking like that it's like yeah I don't think that's healthy I don't know if that's I kind of need guidance, I guess, I would i'm asking you like on what would be."
527.0,Provider,"If you're questioning and then questioning it, then I would say to trust that for yourself like I know you said you sometimes dismiss your gut feelings if it's going to stir up more feelings for you and it's not going anywhere, how would that be helpful for you."
15458.0,Patient,Because yeah because there's no and it is a dead end with not relationship.
527.0,Provider,"yeah and you've and you. You made it clear that. Being with you but talking on the dating APP is not okay. So if you. I guess if you're okay with that and just want to maintain a friendship, but it sounds like it's gotten more than that for you like it's it's gone up another level of emotions for both of you. You know, and so, if I. Like is that making that up then i'm coming back on my word and saying yeah that's Okay, we can still talk and be friends, and you can see other people when. that's not where your relationship was out when it ended."
15458.0,Patient,"yeah it's yeah I think it was just yeah I would always have to remind myself there's like he's talking to other woman and it's like that's gonna hurt because. i'm going to see him and then i'm like yes like even if you're not seeing other woman. physically and like you know and doing all of that, but still. it's still weird. To I guess it's weird to know that, like you know you never know like feelings can they can rise it anytime. Towards a person. without knowing. yeah, so I think it's kind of like playing with fire. letting myself. Be in that process and stuff I don't get it when we're definitely not friends, but definitely a lot more than friends. yeah yeah I don't. I don't think it's I think it's advisable to I don't know if it's advisable for me to stay friends with them and talk."
527.0,Provider,"Sure, and I think it's okay to let him know that you know if he would reach out that you know I I don't. I don't want to you know I don't want to see you right now I don't want to speak with you right now, because i'm still you know because I need time to process through this or you know what However, you want to say that for yourself that it's okay to set that boundary for you."
15458.0,Patient,yeah.
527.0,Provider,"Because you have to you have to acknowledge your own feelings and this and where where you feel comfortable setting limits for yourself and not. You know because I don't want you, you know cycling in that in that trauma again like, here we go in another, you know i'm not gonna say anything i'm going to dismiss things. You know to be understanding of the other person versus I need to be understanding for myself in take care of myself too."
15458.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
527.0,Provider,"So, with regard to focusing on yourself what would you like to explore and I know you're going to work on school stuff but like just within yourself as far as when when when you decide to explore, you know relationships again for yourself."
15458.0,Patient,"I think i'm not going to be giving everything I need to be selfish or I need to hold that part of me a little sock. And then let the other person display that, in a way. And then. Work on it, because I just feel like. me being giving and then a half being happy about it it's nice but it's also like I need to let the other person I need to feel loved. I want to be like. I want to be like, I want to feel what i'm able to make you feel."
527.0,Provider,"yeah so I want you to I want you to journal about that and identify what is it what is it I want and what i'm looking for and what I need. mm hmm. well. And so, this will be a challenge because yeah I don't I don't see you is too much. But I can understand where that comes from too and i'm and how much of it is there's a cultural piece in there, too, for you db it's like. You know what is the typical role of a woman in a relationship and in your I think challenging some of that for yourself like yes, I believe this but and i'm not so sure about this, and so you know you're wrestling with that as well."
15458.0,Patient,"Okay, in which. Do you think it would be be able to tell me like what cultural aspect of it as a woman i'm feeling more like if I like it well, two ways on it."
527.0,Provider,"Yet well i'm just thinking like your your thoughts on arranged marriages versus allowing yourself to find something more like fall into more natural. For yourself. You know that that's kind of been a conflict for you like you know, yes, this is, in my culture, but I also want to see it. A little differently for myself to and explore it differently."
15458.0,Patient,I have addressed not to my parents. That I do want you know where I can just find someone instead of.
527.0,Provider,That one for another that how did that go.
15458.0,Patient,"Oh, my God was like you know, like maybe if you are like younger would have made sense, but like you're you're like a lot older now So how are you. How does this How does that happen if we don't find someone for you, how are you going to find someone for yourself when at this age is what he said that was in Santa Monica so. that's what I was thinking again."
527.0,Provider,So now it goes into the twos i'm too old.
15458.0,Patient,yeah the two old and i'm like oh yeah i'm too old now yeah.
527.0,Provider,"So you have a lot to choose on your list yeah. Yes, okay."
