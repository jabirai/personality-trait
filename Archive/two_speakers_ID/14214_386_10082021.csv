386.0,Provider,"All right. And it looks like here um once you go to your PPs evaluation, the. they'll get you scheduled for individual therapy, it looks like they've already done it for your rap session. So, right now, what the prescription recommendation is showing is that there is no shows within the last 15 days and so with the perception recommendation notate says that we are supposed to reduce your prescription order to afford a supply. It typically would have an additional refill on it to get you over to your next group appointment, however, what we'll do is buprenorphine suboxone and three times a day dosing because your next appointment is not until. On the 12th technically the 13th for group i'm going to go ahead and get you a sentence script for 1234 a i'm going to do a three day supply.
