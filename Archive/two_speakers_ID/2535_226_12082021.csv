226.0,Provider,"it's been a while, since i've seen."
2535.0,Patient,"yeah lots and lots happened actually. My dog. She is 11 years old, she got sick and passed away. We got two new puppies and then my mom is now cancer free, I think. Like they said that chemo worked it got rid of it all but they're still going to do radiation anyways. wow that makes sense."
226.0,Provider,"But wow that's huge. Oh, my gosh hey what kind of what kind of puppets to chicken."
2535.0,Patient,Show you one other poodles. yeah. They both look about the same the other ones just a little bit lighter.
226.0,Provider,"Oh, where did you guys get him."
2535.0,Patient,We found somebody selling them on craigslist. Oh yeah.
226.0,Provider,"How old, are they."
2535.0,Patient,16 weeks. yeah we've only had them for two months now.
226.0,Provider,wow. We got your hands full.
2535.0,Patient,yeah definitely.
226.0,Provider,"Okay, well, you must be so relieved about your mom."
2535.0,Patient,"that's me yeah. Yes, definitely."
226.0,Provider,Not that big huge news how's your dad's house he doing.
2535.0,Patient,"he's doing the same. yeah he still needs to lose weight, but has no motivation to do it."
226.0,Provider,Has he had any more stairs or has it been.
2535.0,Patient,it's been pretty clear sailing so far.
226.0,Provider,"Okay, so. let's talk about like some treatment plan goals like just let's talk about some short term and long term goals that you'd like to work on. So. Okay, so can you think of three very short term goals that you wanna. That you want to. accomplish."
2535.0,Patient,Like just goes in general or goals relating specifically to recovery.
226.0,Provider,"yeah really relating towards let's start with recovery and if there's some other ones in general, we can talk about that, but yeah really like recovery goals."
2535.0,Patient,"Okay, and I hadn't really thought about that so."
226.0,Provider,yeah.
2535.0,Patient,Like what type of things would be a goal.
226.0,Provider,Well okay so. Like a long candle an example in the long term goal would be. taping.
2535.0,Patient,yeah.
226.0,Provider,Or you know. Another long term goal like how many milligrams of suboxone I are now.
2535.0,Patient,I take two eight milligrams per day.
226.0,Provider,"Okay, so let's 16 so you could say, like a long term goal would be you want to get to. Like like eight milligrams in. You know X amount of time. For. You want to go down to like 11 milligrams like whatever you feel would be really doable for you, because I know, like, for example with tapering that can take time because obvious sleep, you know you do it slowly. yeah because you don't want to kick yourself into a total detox you know, and that should also just as we're talking about this, and that should also obviously we discussed with the push. So that would be like a long term goal like short term goals are you know. I don't know like working and working through some emotions that you feel like you've buried, or you know working through a traumatic event that you don't feel like you've really talked about. You know anything that related to like how how to heal yourself like, how can you get to like the next phase that you want to get to because really like goals are obviously you want to make them attainable. Right, because when you accomplish a goal that just increases your self esteem and then you can set another goal. Right so like should be. The goal setting is really, really important to do just in general kind of keeps you on track keeps you working towards something keeps you focused because life can't just be work and coming home. Right, because that is super boring yeah. like that."
2535.0,Patient,feels like.
226.0,Provider,"yeah exactly so it's about like goal setting is about keeping yourself like out of a rut and it could be wanting to learn something new, it can be going back to something that you used to do that you're no longer doing. So I mean it really just depends on like Neil and what's important for you."
2535.0,Patient,"So. i've been Bowling again also that's another. The League started up and i'm like trying my best to care. I stopped I stopped caring about it and. I don't go out of my way to go, practice or anything but while i'm when I am there, I really focus up and try to take care with every shot. Nice and like that was sort of a goal, I had was. be as good as I was going. Okay, and i'm i'm doing okay so far i'm. About average."
226.0,Provider,"So how many nights. Like days a week, are you both."
2535.0,Patient,Just one.
226.0,Provider,Is it at night.
2535.0,Patient,"So Thursday nights at seven. it's really hard because we don't get finished until like 930 usually and then I got to. come home unwind take the puppies out now get to bed it, you know 11 1130 and got to be up at four."
226.0,Provider,Oh wow.
2535.0,Patient,God.
226.0,Provider,"Oh, my God that's really hard okay. Okay, so but that's good, because what that is is that's getting you out of the House that getting the active again like we've kind of talked about that, before you know, like one covert hit all of that shut down, obviously. yeah so like getting out and socializing and being active or learn was like shut down. So okay so short term goal, you could put you know. You know tech to continue with bullying one day a week, just as like it's a coping skill that's a really good coping. So we can use that one Okay, and what else, what else can you think of."
2535.0,Patient,I like another goal that i've kind of achieved that I set just recently was to get under 200 pounds again.
226.0,Provider,it's been a while. that's a great one.
2535.0,Patient,And i'm there now so i'd like to maintain that.
226.0,Provider,"Okay perfect. that's super good how did you get there, how many pounds to do lose."
2535.0,Patient,"was like. 10 to 15 like my weight fluctuates it could be seven pounds different from day to day. Well i'm at roughly 195 right now, and I was at about 205. I just. Like stopped eating sweets and limited myself on sodas and. stuff like that I don't really exercise anymore anything."
226.0,Provider,"yeah okay cool that's a great one. Okay, one more short term goal."
2535.0,Patient,Well we're trying to save up money for. A new car.
226.0,Provider,"Great. Okay, and do you have a timeframe on when you would like to have an APP like you know just kind of a. nap. But yeah the time."
2535.0,Patient,"My time frame would be like four. Months my girlfriend's time frame would be tomorrow, she she's ready to go buy it."
226.0,Provider,"at it. Okay okay cool. Okay, and then what about Okay, what about long term."
2535.0,Patient,"Long term tapering is definitely something I you know for long term and. I feel comfortable right now. So i'm not ready, but it is something I do want to do."
226.0,Provider,"Okay, so let's just shoot, for you know again it's not written in stone so. Now, obviously with the holidays coming in that's never like I would never say you know."
2535.0,Patient,Start tapering you know yeah. Maybe we can start after. After the holidays.
226.0,Provider,"Okay, great. Okay, great. they're really good. And then, what about okay so for Christmas like what are your what are you guys plans, what do you, what do you guys doing."
2535.0,Patient,"we're gonna go to my girlfriend's parents house, which is just around the corner and I think my my parents will probably come and a lot of her family will come. That will be Christmas Day i'm sure we'll we'll do stuff The night before to with all the family in town. and probably the whole weekend. We have our friends friends misgiving like we mix thanksgiving and. Christmas together. somewhere in the middle we're we're doing that this weekend, I think."
226.0,Provider,I where do you guys do that.
2535.0,Patient,"I think we're doing at our House, this year just we rotate houses."
226.0,Provider,yeah so this must be a like a little bit of a different Christmas because last year there was all the lockdowns for you guys right.
2535.0,Patient,"There was, but me and my friends, we didn't really pay attention to them, we still had our friends misgiving. We just set set further apart."
226.0,Provider,yeah definitely say great okay so how's how's work going for you what's new there.
2535.0,Patient,"it's been crazy lately we've had. tons of jobs that aren't ready. So they're pushing out but we already ordered their cabinet so they're just piling up in the warehouse or warehouse was over full like we had to. call up other warehouses and ask them for favors. Some of our cabinets. But it's just now, this last week slow down a little bit so we're clearing out some space."
226.0,Provider,"So, you know how all those a container ships are supposedly not unloading so that doesn't affect you guys then right when I say that."
2535.0,Patient,"Well, I missed the question."
226.0,Provider,"So, you know how there's a lot of container ships that aren't able to dock and unload."
2535.0,Patient,"Oh no yeah that doesn't affect us. not really like all of our manufacturers are in the United States, they probably get their wood from overseas and we. Are lead times have increased some but. they're still getting their supplies."
226.0,Provider,"wow that's crazy I was always want because I heard, there was a paint shortage, did you hear that."
2535.0,Patient,"yeah we. all over the place, we that's why a lot of the jobs are pushing out is there's paint shortages there's garage door shortages. All sorts of weird things."
226.0,Provider,So is the paint. Is the paint. So why is why is there a paint shortage is that because it's coming from overseas or what's going on with that.
2535.0,Patient,"I would think that's why or. Maybe it's. Our manufacturers when they first slow down because it coven told us, because they didn't have any buddy working they. They laid off half their employees. So. Maybe that's why the pain is there isn't they don't have any employees, but they should have their employees back by now. Maybe they're still filling back orders from."
226.0,Provider,"Okay, so do you get a couple days off then for the holidays looking forward."
2535.0,Patient,yeah I get I think just Friday off.
