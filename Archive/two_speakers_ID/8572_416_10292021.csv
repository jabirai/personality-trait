416.0,Provider,"Too much heartbreak all at once. yeah. um so last time we talked a little bit about. You keeping like a record of your your mood and things that come up that affect your mood, are you able to do that."

416.0,Provider,"So what have you noticed, have you noticed any trends are triggers and your mood changes."
8572.0,Patient,i'm really worried about getting a job that's that's my main thing that bothers me a lot. Okay. But it doesn't get me super depressed or anxious or anything like that.
416.0,Provider,yeah.
8572.0,Patient,"A lot, a few days ago I ran out of my trailer I have it now, but there was a confusion with the tar again not confusion, but it just takes a long time and I went a couple days without my trailer and that's."
416.0,Provider,wow yeah.
8572.0,Patient,Because I just have mood swings because of the withdrawal and it's not it's really not good.
416.0,Provider,yeah no that's terrible false and under things we can't totally control but it's terrible that you have to go through that.
8572.0,Patient,"yeah I was really I was really. Pretty upset I don't know who to talk to you about it, but I I emailed tanya on the 20th or shauntel. On the 20th and then. I emailed her again on the 25th because the pharmacy said she didn't send my prescriptions in. And then she did send them in the second time, but I had completely run out of my prescriptions and I was very upset about it and I didn't know like where to go. well."
416.0,Provider,"You cannot so you did the right thing by email in her you can also email me, and I can try to follow up and you can also call the virtual clinic and ask for. The prescription hotline they have like a prescription department and so Those are all options and so sorry that happened but yeah we can. Even if you if you send me an email I i'll just contact and tell directly and say hey Catherine says you forgot to send in her things and she'll go oh my gosh i'm so sorry Oh, and then she'll do it, but. You know if you're. You shouldn't have to do go through that but, if it comes up again, hopefully it won't go ahead and just you know reach out to all of us and we'll make sure it gets done."
8572.0,Patient,Okay.
416.0,Provider,yeah i'm sorry.
8572.0,Patient,it's just very frustrating very frustrating.
416.0,Provider,"yeah I would be frustrated with it too. And with the prior authorization the tar I don't know what tar sands, for a start."
8572.0,Patient,But it's.
416.0,Provider,A crime right. The prior authorization thing right.
8572.0,Patient,"yeah pretty much it's not I guess it's not the same thing, but it's kind of just they need more information for the insurance to approve it."
416.0,Provider,"yeah yeah Okay, so we do have a person who handles that. I think her name is Danielle."
8572.0,Patient,You are then yeah.
416.0,Provider,she's pretty great have you it sounds like you've been in touch with her.
8572.0,Patient,"Yes, well, the last couple times i've texted texted me back even in a couple days, she usually in the past she's done that. But I know that she gets super busy."
416.0,Provider,"So again, if that stuff comes up, you can reach out to me to because maybe you know and i'll send her extra messages to are all you know see if there's anybody who's assisting her that I can reach out to you so just just let me know to okay. And i'll see what I can do to push things along because I don't want you to have to go through that."
8572.0,Patient,it's it's not. Good for me to be on and off my medication. or no it's not. And it's it also affects my sleep and it just affects everything.
416.0,Provider,"Absolutely no good for you. yeah i'm so sorry you've had to go through that. that's not fun. So, other than that how has your mood been pretty steady or have you been up and down How has it been."
8572.0,Patient,My mood is pretty steady.
416.0,Provider,"Okay. I know you're worried about the job thing. But that doesn't seem I mean. When you're looking for a job, often you kind of worry about that right, so that seems like a pretty normal response to the situation you're in right it doesn't seem like a mental health issue. And I mean have you started, because I knew, you were gonna wait until you got back from like the wedding and all your travels and stuff to apply, have you started applying yet."
8572.0,Patient,"Yes, yes I have."
416.0,Provider,how's it going.
8572.0,Patient,it's okay. there's a huge problem now I keep getting phone calls like robo calls. And when you're when you're looking for a job you want to always answer the phone. But a lot of them are spam calls and I don't know and they're coming from my area code to do.
416.0,Provider,So I hate that.
8572.0,Patient,"yeah I don't I don't know which ones to answer which ones, not to because my my call screening doesn't always say that it's spam."
416.0,Provider,mm hmm.
8572.0,Patient,it's really frustrating and then i've been getting the scam emails to and some of them are fake job offers and I don't I don't open them. But it's just. it's rough.
416.0,Provider,it's annoying yeah that's annoying that's terrible. So what kind of stuff are you applying for.
8572.0,Patient,A clerical work or merchandising.
416.0,Provider,"Oh, like what you were doing before."
8572.0,Patient,I would really like to do that um. it's I always when I worked in retail I always liked making things look Nice. And my department.
416.0,Provider,You found like you're really good at it.
8572.0,Patient,"I just I don't know merchandising seems like something I can really do you can work independently. Which is really nice for me because I don't I. I don't have great social skills and it just makes me I don't know i'm more introverted anyway, so I like to do my own thing."
416.0,Provider,"I think you do have some pretty great social skills, by the way, I think you don't have a lot of confidence in your social skills. I think you. You do have great social skills."
8572.0,Patient,"A few years ago, I actually did a test. To see if I was on the autistic spectrum and they they said that I was definitely on the spectrum um but. yeah not. Not so bad."
416.0,Provider,"No, no, no, but I, I see that it's tough for you to feel confident that you're interacting like interacting with people. In a way, that feels sort of I hate this word, but like normal right. But by."
8572.0,Patient,My normal.
416.0,Provider,us.
8572.0,Patient,I get what you mean by normal.
416.0,Provider,yeah like by socially acceptable or whatever right. and small talk is tough for you.
8572.0,Patient,yeah.
416.0,Provider,"yeah you know what i've really wanted to do with bright heart for a while and I still might do it. Is do a group as a special group for folks who are neuro divergent because you're you're not the only neuro divergent person I have, I have quite a few actually. And it would be really fun to do that and combine in like mental health therapy and also and stuff around like picking up social cues and. Organizing your environment to you know to function well for you and stuff like that it would be really fun to to do some of that um. But."
8572.0,Patient,yeah definitely would like to learn more life skills like that. Because they don't teach in high school. or college or.
416.0,Provider,"know the world is not set up for folks who are neuro divergent and i'm neuro divergent as well i'm not on the spectrum, but I have pretty significant sensory issues so. So, like you, I don't do small talk I don't understand how to do small talk I hate like networking events or. Happy hours or anything like that, where i'm expected to do that I run screaming in the other direction, and because I just don't know how to do it, and I feel super awkward and so i've had to learn how to pick up on social cues and tune into people in a different way. And then i've worked with folks who are neuro divergent a lot and I think neuro divergence is like the coolest thing ever because. All of the good stuff in this world comes from neuro divergence, if you think about it right like. All of the cool inventions coming from people who have who don't think like everybody else right who have a different way of being in the world, but it comes with its own challenges, because the world is not set up for people who are neuro divergent."
8572.0,Patient,yeah.
416.0,Provider,"And you get labeled as like awkward are you know social misfit or whatever right we get labeled as these things and. we're not. And, but because the world isn't set up for us, we we lose confidence in ourselves a lot. yeah."
8572.0,Patient,"If they taught about neuro neuro divergence in school, then a lot of it was a lot easier to. People would notice the signs and. be like okay that person's nerd a Virgin. they're not just aloof and snobby or anything."
416.0,Provider,"that's right that's right yeah and you know the good news is that they are now in a lot of places doing more doing a lot more education around that stuff and my son goes to a school where. it's a private school my son is also nerd of origin, but he he goes to a school where. there's so there's 12 kids in his class, and I would say, at least half of them are neuro divergent in one way or another they're ADHD some of them are definitely on the spectrum. A number of them like my son or what we call to eat twice exceptional right where you have like some sort of challenge, then you also you're developing really asymmetrically so you're like exceptional in one way and then really behind it another so. yeah in in his school, they just teach that it's all normal it's all part of like we're just going to embrace it all and we're going to create an environment that works for everybody and so it's very normalized there but. Unfortunately it's not as normalized and certainly wasn't when you were growing up, and definitely not when I was growing up. challenging."
8572.0,Patient,there's a lot of things when I grew up to which is. What happens nowadays. Because people are more aware of it now.
416.0,Provider,That they clamp down on it quicker now for sure.
8572.0,Patient,I noticed.
416.0,Provider,"yeah yeah Thank God. yeah there was when I was growing up to and it's it was harsh girls oh my God junior high girls. it's the worst right take I can trace so much how much therapy Do I need from. junior high girls, I experienced oh my God."
8572.0,Patient,What what kills me is that I see those same girls know sometimes and they're they're Nice.
416.0,Provider,"And they have children, oh. It was so funny the. The biggest bully in my school, I mean she was bad and now I know why she had a horrible home life, and I think she was getting abused as well, but anyway now she. She has four kids and she's a she's on i'm just on Facebook with her and she talks about homeschooling her kids because the schools are are just mean places and there and i'm thinking like who would know better than you, Lady. kids to be subjected to bullying and stuff and i'm."
8572.0,Patient,Exactly how it works.
416.0,Provider,"it's pretty funny I think she's actually like a really great mom now, or at least From what I hear from our mutual friends, but it's just so funny how it comes full circle like that. yeah so but it's great that you're thinking about what's going to be a good fit for you, when you are looking at these jobs right like you know yourself well enough to know. That you don't want to set yourself up for failure, you want to set yourself up for success by looking at environments that you feel safe and comfortable in. Right, where you can interact with maybe one person at a time and not you know, Joe Public all the time. All of that. I think that's why so are you having trouble applying or are you. Are you getting a lot of applications out there, or."
8572.0,Patient,"Yes, i'm doing i'm getting my applications out there. In the past week I haven't had any calls no one's left me voicemails. To call them back yet um but I, there are a lot since I went on vacation there have been a lot more job postings."
416.0,Provider,"I mean it's a crisis out there, and nobody can find people to work for them so yeah I imagine you're going to get offers."
8572.0,Patient,yeah i'm pretty confident about that it's just the getting there it's just the hard part.
416.0,Provider,"yeah yeah and how do you feel about the interviewing I know, last time that was something you were really worried about."
8572.0,Patient,"um Sometimes I feel like I do really well and then other times I I feel like I should say more, but I have nothing to say. um but. I do write down and questions to ask them and I have them next to me when i'm doing my interviews, so I do do have some kind of script. And I also went viral back, I went down a list of the most common questions that interviewers ask and I answered every single one. In at least a sentence one sentence."
416.0,Provider,And perfect.
8572.0,Patient,I read that before we go into interviews to.
416.0,Provider,"that's excellent yeah so you're going in really prepared pretty confident ready to see also if it's a good fit for you, not just for them right you're not trying to sell yourself you're trying to interview them and see like Is this a place i'm going to want to be. All that's great Catherine. And how are things with your fitness I know they that's really important to you."
8572.0,Patient,"it's good, I have a doctor's appointment soon and i'm going to ask her about it, because a I walk every day I eat 1600 calories or less. Like 1200 to 1600 and I lift weights five days a week, and i'm still not losing any weight. So I think there is another problem going on."
416.0,Provider,yeah Have you ever taken any of those. The. yeah they call them. it's like one of the tests that you can take where you figure out how your body reacts to the different macro nutrients.
8572.0,Patient,yeah I haven't taken Ruse.
416.0,Provider,"i've heard about them and i've considered taking i've in fact i'm going to take one. Because, like, for example, and I was told that because I have a high amount of like when I did they did like a body composition thing on me and I have for a woman my age, I have a lot more muscle mass than most women so even when I am smaller than I am right now, I still wait a lot. and And because of that they suggest that I actually never do something like keto or something like that, because my body actually requires a higher amount of it burns carbohydrates, more easily, but then I have to watch out for fat more."
8572.0,Patient,Because.
416.0,Provider,"Because of my body composition right and how my body reacts to different things, and so. it's just interesting because i'd never like and i'm going working with a dietitian as well, and so i've just been learning some of this stuff and. it's really interesting you know there isn't like a one size fits all plan right and it's not just about calories that a lot of times tweaking what you're eating. And to match whatever works for you best is a good way to go, so I don't know if your doctor has that kind of training to be able to talk to you about that, but something to consider maybe asking to connect with a dietitian or something."
8572.0,Patient,i'll ask her about that. Because it's really frustrating.
416.0,Provider,For me yeah I bet.
8572.0,Patient,I put in work.
416.0,Provider,And it may be that this is where your body wants to be right now.
8572.0,Patient,yeah that's true. And I said that if if a physician tells me that then i'll accept it.
416.0,Provider,"yeah yeah right. And it's funny you remember that when I did the circle of control thing in group to remember that. One of the things that I went I was looking at that before Group when I was preparing that group I was looking at, so the stuff you can control is definitely like what goes in your mouth, what kind of exercise you do the stuff you can influence is are things like your weight. Right. Now that we can't control our weight. And then take. Our how much weight, we lose or gain or whatever, there are factors involved in that that we can't control. And it never occurred to me until I had done a really thought about that inside on a piece of paper. That that was true, I think there was this idea that i've always had because of like the diet culture that's out in the world that like I am somehow totally responsible for exactly what I look like and my weight. But it's not true, sometimes our bodies have other needs and they do things, regardless of what we do, we can be as healthy and as careful and a scientific about it is we want. And we should because it's our body, and we want to take care of it, but it doesn't always mean that our body doesn't have another agenda you know or a different need. yeah are there some external like some genetic factor that's involved or you know, maybe your doctor will check your thyroid or something."
8572.0,Patient,I do have hypothyroidism and i'm wondering if it is meant I read.
416.0,Provider,Oh interesting yeah. Do you take medicine for that. So maybe it's a maybe it's a. Change in medicine that's needed or something yeah hyperthyroidism also makes you feel pretty sleepy right.
8572.0,Patient,"Just kind of urgent. yeah and. It makes me depressed to that's how we found it I had been depressed for maybe a whole year straight and they tested my thyroid one one doctor just said hey let's test your thyroid it was low. And it. changed my life, from that point."
416.0,Provider,"wow so there there definitely might be something going on with that have you been feeling kind of low I mean you said, your moods been Okay, but."
8572.0,Patient,"But I do feel tired a lot. I don't. feel tired, even if I get a good sleep."
416.0,Provider,Good indicator that. something's going on i'm glad you're going to.
8572.0,Patient,See the doctor.
416.0,Provider,"that's okay. that's all right, no worries. So what else is going on with what's important for you to talk about today."
