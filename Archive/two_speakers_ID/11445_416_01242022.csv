11445.0,Patient,watching join me.
416.0,Provider,"Now so i'm i'm curious to hear from you from your perspective, why you felt like you were ready to work with a different therapist."
11445.0,Patient,"This is gonna sound mostly vibe I just didn't vibe well with her, she was such a nice lady she didn't you know. do anything to like upset me she was really nice the whole time i'm partially i'm not a big. I know that there's the idea of cognitive therapy with you know doing when you put the act of choice and to do like oh go outside and go for a walk. that's supposed to help her mental health, but I wasn't in a place to be like I was like you know I probably my best still some days, so it wasn't like ready to force myself to do those type stuff and I think that was like where we kind of didn't agreed. That you know."
416.0,Provider,"Okay, this is a bad thing. And me mo what pronouns do you prefer."
11445.0,Patient,"Anyway, i'm fine with all yeah."
416.0,Provider,Do you have even I mean any preference and are you slightly Lehman any of the directions.
11445.0,Patient,Probably more they but. they've been then.
416.0,Provider,yeah okay so you're sort of identifies more non binary. gotcha. yep great I use she her pronouns but i'm really comfortable using any so.
11445.0,Patient,yeah perfect.
416.0,Provider,Okay awesome so I read through a little bit of your or as much as I could get into of your notes and yeah I saw like a lot of. The like what we call behavioral activation sort of. see the light go ahead and go for a walk and that kind of thing um.
11445.0,Patient,I was not good at that.
416.0,Provider,"I mean, it has a place it's in it has a place, but sometimes yeah I mean I hear what you're saying, sometimes you're not quite there yet."
11445.0,Patient,yeah.
416.0,Provider,How long have you felt really depressed.
11445.0,Patient,"I can't remember a time when I wasn't. I was always an anxious kid like extreme anxiety. From a really young age, so. I started more anxious than I did depressed I think the biggest what I noticed the biggest jump for me was high school. Probably my freshman year I got like you know, but I didn't talk about it with anybody because I didn't understand it at the time. It wasn't until my friend got diagnosed that I even understood fully what they are what you know, having depression was and he got diagnosed in ninth and 10th grade."
416.0,Provider,gotcha yeah and did you grow up you're in napa sorry.
11445.0,Patient,yep okay.
416.0,Provider,So did you go to like public high school there.
11445.0,Patient,yeah just yeah vintage so the school was for high school.
416.0,Provider,I actually know well i'm. Up to so.
11445.0,Patient,yeah.
416.0,Provider,yeah I think my nephew might have gotten there at some point he's not the same age. yeah to your 23. And it looks like you've been with us for a little bit right. And you got a group. have this group for you.
11445.0,Patient,"that's a different question um i'm not the biggest fan of group I think it's a little overstimulating for me personally. I think. The like i'm such a late, I like to listen to people kind of person that it feels weird when i'm in group trying to express myself. So I don't know I think I get a little uncomfortable. When i'm in group trying to have to talk about myself."
416.0,Provider,"mm hmm. You do you have any like social anxiety in life, oh yeah extremely. Okay, so group is a challenge for you for."
11445.0,Patient,That yeah.
416.0,Provider,that's actually probably the reason that group is also good for you.
11445.0,Patient,yeah.
416.0,Provider,I could see why it would be really challenging. yeah. um so are you hoping to stay in the same group that you're in or would you like to switch to a group with me.
11445.0,Patient,"You know, I was curious about that I think i'd prefer to switch to one with you. Okay, but if I need to stay in this one i'm not."
416.0,Provider,"No, no, no, and so we have a couple other options, but what's your schedule like do you work outside of the home or what do you."
11445.0,Patient,"Do like don't work, but I do have school, like the only class feeding I have for school is on Mondays and Wednesdays at 2pm to 4pm and that's it that's my that's my like for strange on anything."
416.0,Provider,Okay. What do you look for.
11445.0,Patient,"um for degree wise, or what am I doing this semester."
416.0,Provider,Either way.
11445.0,Patient,"degree was i'm not sure yet i'm thinking I agricultural environmental science and then this semester picking asl American sign language, and then a political science class."
416.0,Provider,Oh cool and are you just going to the napa.
11445.0,Patient,colleges that are JC.
416.0,Provider,"yeah that's a great school. um okay great so one of the. Groups, I have two groups Shan tells your provider right. Yes, so I have two groups of chantel. and wait remind me you don't have any like you're not in recovery from substance use or you. know so that I have two groups with chantel one of them wouldn't work for you, because it's Wednesday at 130. The other one I think might work for you it's Thursdays at four."
11445.0,Patient,Oh yeah.
416.0,Provider,That works perfect to we put you in that one.
11445.0,Patient,yeah sounds good.
416.0,Provider,"Okay, so I will ask to tell you transfer. For."
11445.0,Patient,"i'm going to assume 4pm, but I just want to make sure."
416.0,Provider,Would you say.
11445.0,Patient,"i'm going to assume 4pm, but I just want to make sure. Yes, okay."
416.0,Provider,"yeah oh God, no. I work early but not bad early."
11445.0,Patient,Fair enough.
416.0,Provider,"Hello okay. So we'll do that the Thursday at 4pm group and then. Soon remote I have like I have only been in business, but i'd rather hear from you, if you're up for it, just like what are your goals in therapy, what are you hoping to get out of this."
11445.0,Patient,"that's it that's the question that's a little hard for me um I think just overall feel any ounce of like I want to you know exist and live. Or you know. suicidal oh yeah pretty I mean I wouldn't say i'm like i'm not a danger, I can't convince myself to do it, but yeah i've been for a while."
416.0,Provider,So you have like regular suicidal ideation but no plan is that what i'm.
11445.0,Patient,yeah that's yeah probably the closest thing. So.
416.0,Provider,"So you want to get to a place where you're not having intrusive suicidal ideation. you're feeling like yeah this life is a good one, and I want to stick around."
11445.0,Patient,"yep or even yeah just just by but to the best of my ability, you know, for as long as i'm here yeah. um yeah I think that's, the main one um I therapy is a complex complex thing for me personally, because I was told when I was growing up that it wasn't beneficial by my mother so."
416.0,Provider,You.
11445.0,Patient,"Know kind of how that we're relationship with it because I they took me so long to seek help due to a lot of reasons, but that was one of them, so um."
416.0,Provider,How. Do you. live.
11445.0,Patient,I live with roommates technically it's my sister and then her partner.
416.0,Provider,And what's so your mom did you grow up in napa.
11445.0,Patient,You said you didn't grow up in napa yes.
416.0,Provider,"So what's your relationship like, with your mom and I presumably your dad now."
11445.0,Patient,"i'm my real dad and lives in New Jersey don't talk to him almost at all um. The times we do. are pretty straight to the point, these days, I mean I used to see him a little more growing up. He fly out, and you know but. I haven't seen him, and since I graduated high school he came he came to see me graduate and that was what five years ago now, something like that. yeah um and then my mom's complex I think part of me wants to forgive her for the like neglect and things growing up, but it's hard, because I haven't actually sat down and talked to her about everything. But you know that's it's just accomplished my relationship with her is complicated, right now, for a long time it was I didn't want anything to do with her, but now i'm kind of in a weird place with it."
416.0,Provider,"gotcha well you're getting old happens right things sort of come around and. But it sounds like there's some opportunities there to kind of find some peace. For you. Right, I mean I assume your mom would, at some point, like some pieces well but she's not my patients."
11445.0,Patient,"Just reached out and asked me to you know to sit down with her, I just keep putting it out of the way it's something that I, you know, like Oh, you know yeah similar time."
416.0,Provider,"And, and how is your like your social support network, who do you have people in your life that are healthy and strong and are there for you and know what's going on with you."
11445.0,Patient,yeah I have a pretty strong one actually.
416.0,Provider,awesome I love hearing that. that's I mean that's like. you're you're halfway there already like. that's a big deal right. Because there's nothing that I mean we tend to isolate when we're. depressed and anxious.
11445.0,Patient,Oh yeah.
416.0,Provider,"The very isolating disease, they both are, and so I most of the time when I meet with patients it's like I have to work with them to get not isolated anymore so."
11445.0,Patient,Right right.
416.0,Provider,"So that's good and and the fact that they know what's going on with you and can kind of be present and support you, is huge to. Definitely awesome. And like how. Where are you in your sort of like your non binary like what Where does this, how much does this play into what's going on in terms of like your mental health and that sort of thing how much of a role, do you want this to take up in therapy."
11445.0,Patient,"It plays a strong amount i'm i'm trying this year to put myself like outside my body and respect myself, you know what I mean like my body is just something that I have to be in and it's not bad or good for the moment i'm trying to just let it be a body. But something i'm working on. Because I have both a pretty severe dysphoria and dysmorphia."
416.0,Provider,If you've had eating disorders in your life.
11445.0,Patient,"yep. Well, eating is complicated, now I think I have more disordered eating and eating disorder. But yeah i've never been diagnosed with an eating disorder I think i've had one I mean when I was younger I binge a lot, and then you know feel guilt i've always had guilt around food, you know."
416.0,Provider,"Okay, so you have a complicated relationship with food. And with your body image."
11445.0,Patient,yep okay.
416.0,Provider,"yeah that stuff can and then yeah connect to that with some depression, anxiety and it just is like a mushy nasty soup haha. OK. yeah we can definitely work on all of that that's that's well within my wheelhouse. So never diagnosed with an eating disorder, but you're recognizing pretty clearly you have disordered eating and I was reading through your notes that there was, you have a lot of worries about food contamination."
11445.0,Patient,"Yes, I have a pretty severe food contamination problem, one of my last few years, living at home, my home is my mother, it was always kind of gross. from a young age, she didn't know both how to clean house and then later on, she was disabled and my step dad didn't clean well and I was never taught how to you know because they didn't so it was always just kind of gross but the last like two years they were pretty extreme. So I developed a pretty once I left, because I was in survival mode at the time, but once I left for about a year I started to like um you know realize how I didn't have to be. You know in survival mode and it really started a spiral of like contamination of food and and so now I have problems within."
416.0,Provider,"So you're just kind of always worried that your food is contaminated, and you have to have things a certain way so that you're sure they aren't contaminated and."
11445.0,Patient,"I tried to have things a certain way, but my depression makes that hard. So you sometimes that's the work comes in, or sometimes just don't eat um but yeah I try to you know, keep my area clean when i'm doing and things like that."
416.0,Provider,"Okay, and like do you think that you take that to an extreme or is it sometimes."
11445.0,Patient,"um it depends on the day some days are better than others. I usually have to distract myself when i'm eating, which I know isn't good to not be in tune with your body, but I can't eat any other way, a lot of the time so."
416.0,Provider,Because then you'll focus hyper focus on that.
11445.0,Patient,On the food and the the thought process of the food.
416.0,Provider,"Okay, all right yeah okay that gives me lots of good ideas and then I was looking at the other stuff in your chart that I wanted to make sure I talked about and started to think about approaches to. That food contamination, you want to feel better reduce depression yeah yeah and. sounds like that's most of what amanda had in here. Would you add it sounds like you have a fair amount of past trauma to. Is that stuff you've worked on in the past, or like where do you feel like you are with just that do you feel like that the things that happened to you when you were younger still very much affects you. Okay."
11445.0,Patient,"I think I like to ignore them, but I think they do, and a lot of ways, I mean they're small things that I realized aren't normal like that I live with. Someone who grew up in a really good household and, like me and my sister who didn't will do things and then they'll be like What do you do you know when people look at you you're like what are you doing and you're like it's not normal. it's kind of one of those things where it's like oh yeah I guess it did affect me more you know, like. In the back of my mind that I thought it did in some ways for certain things so usually just tried to ignore the past."
416.0,Provider,It has a way of not letting you though right.
11445.0,Patient,mm hmm.
416.0,Provider,"The way of like sneaking up and bite you in the butt. Definitely um okay. And then, did you have I also saw something in here around about like D realization and dis association."
11445.0,Patient,"yeah it's pretty at least from mine, you know understanding of myself some pretty severe dissociation and diarization I am half the time, I think, to social so dissociating. But you know, trying to one of my biggest things is trying to like focus and like you know kind of not be directing you know, through a weird space I don't know like you know."
416.0,Provider,"Do you find that um there, there are times when you kind of tend to you know check out more often like under certain circumstances, are you more disassociated I guess what i'm trying to say."
11445.0,Patient,"yeah when i'm overstimulated so when there's a lot going on. So, like big public places, sometimes when i'm feeling more depressed and other days. But usually, when i'm overstimulated when there's a lot going on."
416.0,Provider,"And, have you ever been assessed far diagnosed with like any kind of neuro divergence like ADHD or autism or anything like that."
11445.0,Patient,"No, not not in that way, I had a learning I have probably still, but when I was younger I got diagnosed with a learning disability and. was in an IEP for majority of my life."
416.0,Provider,What was that was to learn.
11445.0,Patient,"From what I was never I was never fully actually told, but from what my mother is told me the one part of my brain wasn't fully developed when I was younger, so I have an auditory and visual processing disorder."
416.0,Provider,"Oh well, that makes sense, I mean that that's why big big events are tough for you and that's why you would disassociate I mean it's actually really, really functional response. To to being in overstimulating environments your brain can process them."
11445.0,Patient,make sense I didn't that's.
416.0,Provider,"Why, I was asking about that you know yeah. yeah you have we would call it, and probably now, we would call it a sensory processing or sensory integration issue. it's just sort of a more modern name for what you had. But yes that's not something that often goes away and it's just we learn to adapt to it, I have one two. Answers my kid so like yeah we I see it, it happens and but we learned ways of adapting to it over time and your adaptation has been to disassociate and I imagine it's also stay away from overstimulating environments."
11445.0,Patient,I try to it's not always easy.
416.0,Provider,"yeah right you can't always do it, but you're not going to be the one who's like raising your hand going yeah let me go to that like huge music festival right."
11445.0,Patient,"Usually, no."
416.0,Provider,"yeah right because you know that you're not going to be that happy when you're there and you're probably going to check out if okay so that's going to cause you stress, because your brain works differently in that way than a lot of other people."
11445.0,Patient,mm hmm.
416.0,Provider,"So that's good okay and that's really important for me to know too, because that also is probably part of what's going on for you in social settings like, especially in group. Okay, and you may be getting a little overstimulated and. And that's okay it's Okay, but what i'm going to ask you to do and that is just practice it because right avoidance is is the fuel for anxiety."
11445.0,Patient,or.
416.0,Provider,"avoidance is the best fuel it's anxiety eats up avoidance that's all edges, just like ooh yummy let me get bigger and grow and do the giant marshmallow man on the ghostbusters so. We don't want to do avoidance, but we do want to do adaptation right, we want to still do that, and there has to be like a willingness to kind of tolerate some discomfort around it. Because discomfort it's not going to kill us right it's not going to sell spiraling discomfort I mean it helps us get stronger and it's sort of like working out of muscle and getting really sore right same thing. So the discomfort will help you get stronger, but we don't want to like push it too far, so that you're you know."
11445.0,Patient,Right right.
416.0,Provider,"But I promise not to so. yeah so with group and you certainly have the option of just mostly listening, I will ask you to check in and but you know, even if you're just like I get overstimulated in environments like this, so i'm going to do a short check in love you guys peace out, this is an. Interesting conversation that's totally fine."
11445.0,Patient,Perfect sounds good.
416.0,Provider,"yeah i'm all good with that I work with a lot of neuro divergent folks. And like I said I am too, so I know how it is to sometimes like not be okay. And okay. So I think that, so we want to work on anxiety anxiety anxiety and we want to work on depression and you're on meds right. For depression, hoping."
11445.0,Patient,"I just started. Prozac recently, and I think it's been going okay actually So yes, question mark."
416.0,Provider,"Okay, your."
11445.0,Patient,process yeah.
416.0,Provider,"Alright well we'll hold that as a. As a maybe. Okay, so yay for yay for helpful medication and we'll if this one doesn't work then we'll work with chantel to find you on the does. And so, for depression, you know there's definitely their thought processes I don't have to tell you this, but their thought processes that go along with anxiety and depression. And we can't like. Their depression, especially as a chemical problem, so we can't like think our way out of depression. We can definitely. sink our way into it, make it a whole lot worse right like."
11445.0,Patient,yeah definitely we can really take us in bad directions.
416.0,Provider,"And that's particularly true with anxiety, so we will work on a lot of like disordered thinking. and checking our thoughts and working on different interpretations of what's going on in our lives right to sort of when we change our our narrative about ourselves, we can change a lot in our lives. And then, it sounds like maybe you might be a little ready, but i'll take my cues from you to start working on some of the trauma."
11445.0,Patient,Yes. definitely hope so yeah. Yes.
416.0,Provider,Okay yeah I mean i'm i'm here for that too. And because it does seem like it's impacting you especially. Food stuff. With CPS ever involved with you guys as kids.
11445.0,Patient,"No, I would have now that i'm older i'm surprised that no one spoke up especially like a school like like my school district, we were late to school, every day, I mean my sister didn't bring lunch, every day, so the fact that nothing ever happened actually is pretty surprising."
416.0,Provider,"What. Entry school, did you."
11445.0,Patient,Do it twice park.
416.0,Provider,"yeah that is surprising. And then, it was it was it was just you your sister your mom and your dad in the House."
11445.0,Patient,"For a long time, but now I have a younger sister she is forward to, and I believe now he's. So she'll be a freshman in high school when the."
416.0,Provider,Conditions in the home with her oh.
11445.0,Patient,"We tried to we tried to call on them that for a while ago that didn't work, but it does seem like a situation has gotten better. Last week visit them. Because we went for. The holidays. And it seemed like she had food in the House was nice so."
416.0,Provider,"Okay, good. And what about an email that task if you have like are you dating anybody, have you have a partner. nope no is that something that you're looking for in your life or not looking for."
11445.0,Patient,"i'm not like looking for it i'm somewhere on the a sexual spectrum and then romantic wise, I am just kind of eyeballing okay."
416.0,Provider,"Okay yeah so it's like if a cool person comes along, you may hang out with them, but it's not like you're looking to go out and hook up. Definitely okay. good to know. Alright, so what's important for you, I know you said you want to just like you know check out the vibe or whatever, with a therapist and I can appreciate that and what other things like do and don't work for you. In terms of therapy."
11445.0,Patient,As much as anything that's like i'm off the table for for therapy. i'm not the biggest fan of journaling I can never stick to it. i've tried.
416.0,Provider,"i'm with you on that I could ever tried, so I start them and then they get I have a big pile of like journals that I start and then they're just like to started. i'm tell you to journal."
11445.0,Patient,"Particularly being told. to exercise a little a little much for me I don't mind moving my body, but I think, because I have those bad thought patterns, with my body, sometimes it's triggering. So I think sometimes that is not my favorite thing to be told us to like oh go go on a run but I don't mind the idea of like oh you're feeling sad maybe go on a 10 minute you know a little walk."
416.0,Provider,"Nature that's right. yeah um yes 100% we're on the same page on this. I also am you know I mean gay exercise and all of that, but really. It is so much about like being kind to your body and moving. it's not really like I mean I know i'm not looking for you to like a run marathons or anything so and we can even if you want and i've definitely done this, especially with my patients who are really depressed and we've i've gone for walks with them. Oh, and like you know I you know, especially patients who tend to isolate. And inside all day. i'm like when was the last time you got some sunshine and like wet and breathe outside like. Air outside of your House put your shoes on let's go."
11445.0,Patient,right to do that together.
416.0,Provider,And we can do grounding exercises and that sort of thing to.
11445.0,Patient,yeah that sounds nice.
416.0,Provider,"So i'm happy to do that this is the beauty of Tele health, we can do stuff like that. that's right. And then, what about things like what kinds of things do you do to help yourself when you're really anxious like to you have strategies that work to kind of help you come back down."
11445.0,Patient,"um I don't know if i'd say that anything that works. I think, usually I distract myself I try to distract myself, which you know work sometimes. Usually, when I have anxiety try to avoid whatever's going on, which again avoidant. But if I can I kind of just associate or just have to kind of deal with it, which I mean you know. yeah sometimes you have to."
416.0,Provider,"Okay, so we can definitely work on that too. Because we got some strategies."
11445.0,Patient,sounds good.
416.0,Provider,Just panic attacks.
11445.0,Patient,Not and not much anymore now not too extreme enough to be a panic attack.
416.0,Provider,"Okay well that's good I mean you still have sounds like disordered anxiety, but they're not panic attacks okay."
11445.0,Patient,I don't go out and public enough.
416.0,Provider,Have you ever worked in Have you ever seen this book before did amanda. introduce you to this book and. Are you open to some of this to doing some of this with me this is actually i'm not like much of a huge like workbook kind of person. Usually I really like this one. And this is so good for anxiety and phobias stuff. If you have the financial means to get this you can order it on Amazon just make sure that you get the seventh edition. Do you think you'd be able to do that.
11445.0,Patient,"I can try my financial situations, a little."
416.0,Provider,"Okay, so don't don't worry about it. If you can't you can't that's I you know I don't want to place any more stress on you. But if you find yourself in a better financial situation. And then it would be great for you to get this. And if not that's Okay, because we'll still we can still do work together and it."
11445.0,Patient,sounds good yeah okay.
416.0,Provider,"All right, what else is important for me to know other than we need to schedule our next appointments."
11445.0,Patient,No further thing I can think of off the top of my head i'm the type of person where i'm know fox had empty until it comes and then i'm there.
416.0,Provider,"love that right thanks brain yeah appreciate it. Alright, so. we're actually scheduled I usually do I don't know how long amanda sessions are I usually do 45 minute sessions."
11445.0,Patient,yeah it's about time yes. exact same yes perfect.
416.0,Provider,"Okay, and then. see if they did they schedule you for more than one with me, or is this the only one."
11445.0,Patient,This is the only one.
416.0,Provider,"So let's get you scheduled. So then i'll see you every week in group and then also in. In. individuals. that'd be really great actually I love that continuity of care. Okay. And so, should we just stick with like this day of the week, and this time."

416.0,Provider,"They have, and I know that there are like trans and non binary groups and that share resources like that. That home i'm a lot of them are online, these days, I can I can look into it and see if I can get Ahold of any of them for you, because I."
11445.0,Patient,that'd be nice Thank you.
416.0,Provider,And yeah so because i've had multiple patients who have changed their names and I also just have people in my life who've done that. And they haven't had to pay a lot of money for it. Because I think they found the lawyer to do it pro bono.
11445.0,Patient,"Interesting yeah no I didn't know that my my friend wanted to do it, he looked into the process and it was like $800. So he was like i'm. cannot afford that either so he hasn't done it either, but."
416.0,Provider,What is your means of financial support.
11445.0,Patient,"At the moment, it was the government now it's nothing so I mean, I still have a little money due to that, but mostly I. I get to live kind of here for free. During once I do my taxes, I have two little we're supposed to pay $200 a month, so once I get my taxes i'm going to pay her. But at the moment i'm mostly live kind of just on. You know."
416.0,Provider,So does somebody your sister owns the House or something.
11445.0,Patient,No my my yes someone on the House it's my partner it's her partner his mother.

11445.0,Patient,yeah we're really lucky.
416.0,Provider,yeah that's a great situation. Right. Definitely so and financial stress seems like a big.
11445.0,Patient,"Is that part of your anxiety yes that's a pretty big one, I. yeah and I, the thing about like because i've obviously i've worked before in my life I had jobs, you know, in the past, the last both do the coven I have more fun because it around working. But also, I originally took time off this wasn't a literally quit my job right before the band, and I was like two weeks before we went on lockdown. Because I was going to I was gonna go to Disneyland. We didn't go obviously because of the lockdown which is."
416.0,Provider,Fine.
11445.0,Patient,"But so we were to seven business like quick, because I was like you know what i'm not gonna i'm just gonna quit take some time to myself depend on the cabin. Can I just have so much extreme anxiety around working at this point that I like panic when I mean you'd like look for job he's like."
416.0,Provider,So you're sort of your your anxiety is around getting sick.
11445.0,Patient,partially I had anxiety before that. interaction with people i'm not good at. Social cues and things like that. I get overstimulated environments.
416.0,Provider,Being on my feet. For eight hours is brutal on my.
11445.0,Patient,there's just a few factors. But majority of it is. anxiety around.
416.0,Provider,People and yeah you might be great at an office job or something right some some something kind of behind the scenes. uh huh are you considered a desk and do. stuff that isn't over you know where you're in a kind of muted environment.
11445.0,Patient,Definitely uh huh.
416.0,Provider,"Something like that might be helpful. Okay. So it also sounds like there's a. You said you have trouble with social cues. and small talk, I imagine. Okay. yeah. I think. makes sense. yeah that makes sense, and that certainly makes you know social anxiety bigger. Right when you're like ultimately like you're flying blind in there. yep like everybody's understanding things that you're not. Is that what it was like when you were a child to."
11445.0,Patient,"Yes, uh huh. yeah I had extreme anxiety as a child had like panic attacks as a child."
416.0,Provider,and your parents or your mom did she ever get you therapy when you were little.
11445.0,Patient,"No. No she knew I was an anxious kid I mean. hide i'd also have like meltdowns over homework, I had this like I had severe school troubles. Actually, was held, I had held back a year in kindergarten both due to my learning disability, but also, I couldn't make friends, for the first two years of my life I didn't make a friend and tell. When I was in grade after first grade, and I only had one friend up until middle school."
416.0,Provider,"All right. Oh, goodness, I feel like you grew up in the wrong generation right, because I think if, like first of all, now they do two years of kindergarten pretty regularly."
11445.0,Patient,"Oh, do they."
416.0,Provider,Oh yeah.
11445.0,Patient,I didn't know that that's.
416.0,Provider,Like pk is.
11445.0,Patient,Right yeah.
416.0,Provider,"Yes, most kids so many kids especially depending on when your birthday is don't go into kindergarten emotionally ready."
11445.0,Patient,Right yeah.
416.0,Provider,So they do tk and it's not about academics it's about learning to be in school. Every chain with other people right so two years of kindergarten is like super normal now.
11445.0,Patient,yeah it's Nice.
416.0,Provider,"And there's a totally different level of understanding around social and emotional development, now that there wasn't. 20 years ago."
11445.0,Patient,yep.
416.0,Provider,it's just so different and there's a much more understanding of neuro diversity. But there was.
11445.0,Patient,I say we've gotten yeah we've gotten. gotten a lot better at that.
416.0,Provider,"yeah I wish I could snap my fingers and do a do over because I think you would have had a different experience right. Instead of walking away with potentially harmful messages about yourself like there's something wrong with you, or you know I don't know what what messages, do you think you took away from those experiences."
11445.0,Patient,"Yes, school always made me feel like if I didn't perform well, I was you know worthless kind of thing I think it's still. It sticks with me now you know if I if I fail, a test, I put you know puts me in a bad place like mentally and you know even just school is very stressful for me, even just. I got my syllabus for my political science class, and you know all the work on, but I was so overwhelmed you know because I was like and realistically if I set it up, I could do it, you know what I mean, but in the moment it's like. it's just overwhelming, so I think when I don't do well on things, particularly with school I took away that I wasn't smart enough, you know good enough to be. My first thought for the political science classes, I wasn't smart enough to be in the class, but then I talked to my friends and I was like that's you know i'm just gonna I was like that's a bad law but also i'm going to wait it out and see how the first few weeks ago."
416.0,Provider,"yeah well it's not accurate right because this stuff that's gone on with you doesn't have anything to do with intelligence. I mean, I can talk to you for 30 minutes and I can tell that your intelligence is not your issue. you're quite smart."
11445.0,Patient,Thank you.
416.0,Provider,"um but, but when we you go in to a situation where you're not picking up on nonverbal communication the way other people are. Like 80% of our communication is nonverbal. you're not understanding social cues you have a disability, where your right brain and left brain aren't working together, and the way they're supposed to. to integrate information and you're struggling to process. stimuli that's coming in almost every classroom in this country is set up to be overstimulating."
11445.0,Patient,yeah.
416.0,Provider,"They have you know crap all over the walls and fluorescent lights and all of that that's incredibly overstimulating to a brain that sensitive to that. way so you're walking in with like your hands tied behind your back, and you know. And, like all these sort of disadvantages that other people aren't having but there wasn't recognition of that. Right those things were real and those are real struggles, you had to figure out how to overcome those on your own which you have in a lot of ways, but the result is that you've carried with you messages about your intelligence that are simply inaccurate. The accurate story is that you walked in with your arms tied behind your back and we're expected to perform, like everyone else, when your brain was not going to allow you to do that. Right and you were not in the right context right learning is in context so fireman is not right for you learning becomes. almost impossible, and yet back in the day and still to some extent, now there was no recognition of that it was like oh something's wrong with the kid. mm hmm not the kid is in the wrong environment and the wrong context."
11445.0,Patient,Right.
416.0,Provider,"But that is the true for you, I see this with folks who are divergent all the time."
11445.0,Patient,"to comment, it was nice to hear. I didn't think about it, you know but yeah that doesn't make sense."
416.0,Provider,yeah so when you're carrying those messages into your policy class Now I want you to pay attention to how often you're saying stuff like that to you right how often are you carrying those messages from that you got from your childhood that were totally inaccurate. into your current experiences.
11445.0,Patient,Okay.
416.0,Provider,"Because we We really need to pay attention to those and start changing those messages. are not helpful we're just increasing your anxiety. And they're also just simply not true. You think differently, but there's nothing wrong with you. Oh there's something wrong with the environment that you're in."
11445.0,Patient,yeah.
416.0,Provider,it's not you it's not you it's me it's not you.
11445.0,Patient,All right.
416.0,Provider,"That is true. I speak the truth, I can hear your is that your burden the background."
11445.0,Patient,yeah let's feel like.
416.0,Provider,"August, like I."
11445.0,Patient,"she's so loud. Sorry, never quiet."
416.0,Provider,"I like Felix already. um OK, so my homework for you, if I can give you a little bit. Just notice to pay attention to how often those messages are popping up in your head because they're probably happening all the time, but they're like they're so common and you're so used to them they're just kind of subconscious now. right but i'm asking you to bring the subconscious into the conscious little bit as much as you can just start really noticing and your clue might be the anxiety when you start to feel anxious, you might be good okay what's going on my head to make me feel anxious. or in my head right now."
11445.0,Patient,we'll try.
416.0,Provider,yeah just notice.
11445.0,Patient,mm hmm.
416.0,Provider,And you try and that's good enough.
