14848.0,Patient,"My sobriety is going good, except that I have still been using marijuana. Everything else I have not used. But who knows. So my biggest. My biggest worry right now is just trying to get my medication right for my mental health, because with my mental health will affect my sobriety. I it's been really worrying me actually i've been waiting for this appointment because. This nurse practitioner had given me samples of a medication club we're exalting and it's been life changing in the last couple weeks it's helped me so so much, and I just got a letter in the mail that my insurance denied it. So that leaves me really stuck on she's been working she was working on my meds for like last six months and. My measure so mashed up, it was leaving me emotionally unstable, I was constantly crying crying over nothing just because, when she was switching my meds and stuff it was just making me go up and down but."
191.0,Provider,that's.
14848.0,Patient,One of my concerns.
191.0,Provider,So you are working with a nurse practitioner.
14848.0,Patient,"Not anymore, because they said since i'm not doing therapist with them anymore and i'm utilizing therapist with you guys that I cannot get their medication services so."
191.0,Provider,You can give you your therapy with them and do your mental health and you could cut down on your therapy with us by once a month and.
14848.0,Patient,"Honestly yeah I don't want to do that because me and her we're not connecting. On that level, I felt like."
191.0,Provider,"Okay, and all the reason I brought that up is that we try to do what's best for the patient, and if you could have. A best of both worlds, we work with you to make certain that happen."
14848.0,Patient,And you started that with her.
191.0,Provider,"Right well i'm sorry to hear that, let me quick question so you're doing well sobriety wise only the marijuana, so I do want to encourage you to stop the marijuana okay so focus on that because I know there's a bigger issue here any slip ups or relapses on opioids or alcohol. No okay Dan how about any uppers or down or stimulus crystal meth cocaine crack anything like that. nope Okay, what about any said it is like the benzodiazepine xanax added value. Okay, all right oh Okay, how much marijuana are you using now."
14848.0,Patient,"Oh, how would you put it, I guess. A couple bowls at nighttime mostly before I go to bed, and then I have one of them oil cards, one of the vapes and I hit that here there throughout the day."
191.0,Provider,"Okay, so marijuana several times a day. Yes, all right, then, so that is an fine mood altering drug and then we're also concerned about how that impacts your lungs okay. So we have a lot of patients that pull back what does marijuana do for you."
14848.0,Patient,"Honestly, I don't really know at this point it's just it's still honestly just given me that hold on have a little bit of a buzz I guess you would call it, and I know it's something that I need to let go to, I think. In the past it's honestly given me anxiety attacks and yeah it's something i'm. Wanting to give up i've done this throughout plus 20 years just pick up pick up quickly."
191.0,Provider,OK and i'm going to confirm your medicines here hydroxyl pricks abuse bar wellbutrin trezza on the last song.
14848.0,Patient,"No more zyprexa she switched that out for the results, because the zyprexa was not working okay."
191.0,Provider,"So let me change that. back so i'll go ahead and put discontinue. Not effective or the patient. Change to rick's all to. See here, did you ever use abilify or anything like that."
14848.0,Patient,"I did not. And that's what my insurance, I think, was like trying to tell me. to utilize is one of those because results he does that have the generic. brand yet and. It just scares me because there were exalted has been a perfect match and I haven't felt like this."
191.0,Provider,"Well, the resulting in the below five or somewhere mm hmm yeah and so sarcophagi exhaust he is a partial dopa maniac agonists and so and it works basically very similar to the. abilify and that's probably why they want you to do that okay. And just so you know i've had patients do really well. Using the abilify and so, if they're not going to pay for the resulting we may have to travel abilify and then, if you. See how that work. And then, if that doesn't work they might do the rick salty so abilify has been around a lot longer than the wreck salty okay. And sort of like what you said about the rick salty have had patients say that about abilify now you see how really well the rick's all to work for you well i've had some people that can't do abilify or any of those types of medicine so."
14848.0,Patient,that's what scares me because.
191.0,Provider,yeah.
14848.0,Patient,"i'm in a so my job really cut my hours so it's like i'm looking for another job and my mental health if my mental health is down i'll stay in the House and not want to get out and be productive because and like right now I don't feel that at all. I feel like I can get out go talk to anyone, and have lots of energy yeah."
191.0,Provider,"And the thing the good thing about it, Nicole, because from salty and abilify work very similar. Yes, you may get the same a similar response and. What we like to do. So precious. We like to do let's say if there's a class of medicines that worked well for you. I wouldn't want to switch you completely outside of that class but we'll try to find something that works similarly okay and and so abilify has worked really well do you have any more Repsol to when is, when will you be."
14848.0,Patient,has been doing one milligram at nighttime and I have a week left okay.
191.0,Provider,"Okay, so using one milligram. At night and what's your diagnosis that you have from these."
14848.0,Patient,People I have been diagnosed with ptsd major depressive disorder anxiety disorder.
191.0,Provider,"Right and so. Once again abilify is a great add on when someone's dealing with depression. And so, ideally, what I usually do, especially if I wanted to add on to depression at all to start with abilify simply because it's more likely to be covered in the resolve it, so the newer medications are often not covered because they don't have a generic. Exactly."
14848.0,Patient,"yeah I looked at the price, and I was like yeah there's no way."
191.0,Provider,"I can be, and so one way to kind of circumvent that before even starting it many times you find try to find something. that's often a really good add on that already has a good generic and so abilify has a really good it's very for both not had anyone be declined abilify okay so let's let's talk a little bit about abilify. So it is an add on. Okay i'm like the result is probably least likely to cause the weight gain and is that what they kind of share it with you to what the risks are exalting."
14848.0,Patient,"They um they did not, they said there's a lower chance that seems like with this from the not the reviews, but whatever is saying that you have a higher percentage of getting more weight, when I was on the zyprexa that's what they."
191.0,Provider,Say yeah.
14848.0,Patient,"I use that for about three weeks and I stopped taking I gained 10 pounds in three weeks and it just I was getting I was tired all the time, no. No, you."
191.0,Provider,"Right and so that's the one of the reasons to with the abilify, and so we can we can definitely look at that and so we can do like a head head comparison with them too, so there's differences in their similarity so just pull this up to."
14848.0,Patient,"With them Okay, thank you."
191.0,Provider,"So they're both so even their name so rick salt is breakfast rizal abilify era peppers all they're very similar so they have a similar name and so they're both. they're both. I hate when these pop ups calm and just block your view Okay, and so they're both ain't typical anti anti as anti-psychotics okay um yeah, and so what they know here is that rick salty. doesn't have a generic form which we do know. abilify does okay. All right, then so yeah and so they're both you know are add ons you think about can help you with the depression exert some of."
14848.0,Patient,US oh.
191.0,Provider,"They have fewer. Side effects oftentimes compared to some of the older antipsychotics. And you like to. My patients they've noticed they've had less weight gain Okay, those are a couple of things there. So I think those are the the main main things and and then some of the negative side effects that you may have on some of. The medicines. You may not notice as much. Debt early you start with a lower doses, so I would start you off on a really long. abilify so let me. Go ahead and. pull this up, I found the lowest dose here for you."
14848.0,Patient,"hold on baby, let me talk on the phone and we'll play with them in a minute."
191.0,Provider,"yeah so the. So. So the last one I have here is like five milligrams, but we can try splitting it in half. and see how you do on that first. And then go from there. So we can look at getting your abilify in. Just and i'll see you again for group. You have enough salty to last you on to group. And so, of course, if there's it anytime you take these. medicines we always want to watch for any type of tremors are shakes as for exalted to see if you."
14848.0,Patient,didn't get those I did get those at the beginning. And then they have subsided.
191.0,Provider,"yep so so just in terms of side effects you do want to look like for movements, you want to see. You may or may not start back with abilify so you need to watch for that okay always watching for weight gain most lot less often with this unless they like circle of some of the other types of medicines. You do want to watch to see where you have any thoughts of like harming yourself or anyone else, is there any type of mood changes okay So these are just the warning signs and then you also always want to think about you know, does it upset my stomach. How does it affect me in terms, do I get a headache do I feel dizzy so what I often tell. People is that anytime you start a medicine, I always start like my own internal journaling I take it. How do I feel. Right, how do I feel now a lot of times the allergic hearts site, of course, if you have itching hives tongue swell and you want to stop that immediately and call 911. So, usually things that are kind of bad really bad, you may often notice this sooner than later. But then those those subtle things you may started noticing to the I don't know if that's that's from the medicine, Dan when you stop it, you know it's it goes away these type services you can't just stop, once you start okay. Right yeah so just notice how you feel there are certain things that, as you take it, it has a tendency to get better because you're just all right."
14848.0,Patient,Okay yeah.
191.0,Provider,"So what I like to do is when you finished with your results I don't want you to take them the same day, I want you to start your abilify like the next day. Half a tablet. very similar okay. All right, yeah Okay, and let me see we've got here unless you click on your chart and everything. And we can go ahead. We have anything else in your."
14848.0,Patient,chart here.
191.0,Provider,"And i'll plan to just send your medicine and and you finished so you're. Here intensity is weekly. appointments and that's what you're doing you've got that taken care of so that's really good. And we look at your curio here off at your. Go ahead go ahead and send your in your abilify. i'm going to start you what one half tab. Okay, just to kind of see how you work."
