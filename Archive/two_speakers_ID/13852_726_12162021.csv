13852.0,Patient,Hello Cindy.
726.0,Provider,How are you.
13852.0,Patient,"i'm okay. yeah I apologize for last week um why. I was looking at the calendar and I thought it was at 2pm which is today's. And I was looking at this week, instead of last week, and it was at 1pm. And i'm sitting here and something, just like why don't you check and see if you're right or wrong, and I looked again I went oh my God, so it was one o'clock and I tried to get in on there real quick, but not. Okay Now I know why they said 20 minutes check in it took me literally 20 minutes. Really yeah to get to a care now."
726.0,Provider,"Oh, it."
13852.0,Patient,wasn't too happy about that.
726.0,Provider,"You know i'm happy i'm happy you're here, and you know it happens, sometimes people either they don't get the alert or something happens like don't worry it's it's fine."
13852.0,Patient,"Oh, I feel bad I like our times, and when we talk and stuff."
726.0,Provider,Oh yeah.
13852.0,Patient,And I know it for you to it's not right to do that i've never been one to.
726.0,Provider,"it's okay it's okay i'm happy you're here, though, but how, how are you doing How has it been since last time."
13852.0,Patient,"um i've been struggling with the. i'm not a good person type thing and. and No self worth again so. But you know when I get in through that and i've learned a lot with you, and you know with. Groups to that. When I get into i'm thinking i'm not. worth anything I I kind of like talk to myself, and you know my brain and hey you know you have people that, like you, you know yet people that love you. get off the pity pot and. So I kind of been doing that a lot and it's been helping."
726.0,Provider,"You know her for a while I was really hesitating to do processing, because just just like I I hear you because you go through these ups and downs and. i'm almost wondering at this point like if we did processing. That maybe it could actually be beneficial, because I think those you know you're if you're. you're making the effort to try to switch your mindset when you're getting the negative thoughts and you've gotten a lot of the groups and the individual sessions that are most wondering. You know if maybe maybe we can try to do some processing and maybe pick something that's not super triggering just just so we can get a good understanding of for you of how the how trauma work. The process of works, because you don't realize it, but basically all of our sessions, he asked talking us figuring out coping skills and things like that that will actually, that is, the process of getting into work, even though you don't think you're actually doing that in the moment."
13852.0,Patient,yeah.
726.0,Provider,So i'm thinking. means. Birth today would you like to talk and then plan for when I get back so we can do processing work or would you like today to do a processing of memory.
13852.0,Patient,And what do we do that memory processing networking when we when you come back.
726.0,Provider,yeah okay okay yeah. yeah.
13852.0,Patient,"yeah no I even like in group yesterday because my groups or Wednesday. When Julie picked me she always picks me I was like Oh, I tried. don't look at me. she'll be. What am I, an audience like oh damn it oh it's not yeah. So I just kind of like you know I told her the same thing i've been dealing a lot with the you know i'm not worthy and i'm Sure enough, a girl before me, had the same feeling, so it was. felt okay to talk. You know, and say it and. And I told her the same thing I you know i'm trying and. When I do get those yeah nobody you know you're not worthy and and I told her no I then I start thinking about the ones that do care about me and when i've mentioned to some of my friends, you know. yeah Sometimes I get into this, or like what you know. Come on, we love you Nadia it's like oh God. So yeah. I think the holidays will be okay because i've got the grandkids coming down."
726.0,Provider,that's awesome.
13852.0,Patient,"yeah and it's so funny because my daughter said, I just want to warn you, because I know how you are, you want the kids every time they're off and she's like. My dad asked him, and it was my ex husband i'm like he's like he's on it too and he's already asked where Am I go. Oh, my God, I want to share."
726.0,Provider,I know what.
13852.0,Patient,yeah. I can share.
726.0,Provider,So what's going to be your plan is it on Christmas Day that they come over Christmas Eve like what would you get when you all do.
13852.0,Patient,"i'm more of a Christmas Eve that's the way we've done it 4000 years 1000 oh my God. All my life yeah. But there's only something that's kind of not to I don't know yet what's going to happen Okay, for example, we've been in the past we've gone i've gone to my daughter's friend's house where she lives. And this is that friend that I told him. i'm not to remember crazy about. he's very. arrogant very arrogant just one of those people that just even he even when he stands it's like. i'm here, you know and. How um but I know, everybody has different personalities, I understand that. and his personality is very dry. And i'm just like okay for thanksgiving this year, my daughter's like oh he's hosting his own families party at his house so. we're doing thanksgiving at your House mom i'm like thank the Lord God almighty Jesus, so I i've been real hesitant and asking her could we please do like thanksgiving be here. i've told her many times, I am not comfortable with that guy at all."
726.0,Provider,yeah.
13852.0,Patient,"And so i'm just kind of Oh, I hope we don't have to do Christmas at his house."
726.0,Provider,"I mean I don't and you know at least you're being like kind of respectful and it, because if they're eventually, no matter. No matter what there's always somebody that you don't feel comfortable with and it's not it's not that there's anything wrong with you or there's just like there's no you don't click with them."
13852.0,Patient,"Exactly. yeah i'm i'm also raised where uh, but this is the Latin thing I guess is that people should have respect for their elders."
726.0,Provider,read them.
13852.0,Patient,"and treat them as such. This guy does not treat me as an elder he treats me like as as if I was one of the little kids or something and. Like just like that very much. So that's something to again that happens to be with his very dry attitude and. The way he was raised, I don't know but that really kind of irks me when he talks to me, I feel like i'm walking on eggshells, when I when I met his house and or I do something wrong, like, for example, was it uh. It was around Halloween I went over there. and I wanted to help out right, so I saw the dishes were piling in the same, and I want to do load the dishwasher. I am an old fashioned person, I do not have a dishwasher never have had a dishwasher my hands or my dishwashers. yeah and my daughter was raised that way right. So I thought I had loaded the dishwasher right, you know. I didn't know, there was a proper way of loading them. But I had loaded it and I go and he came in, he was outside doing something to go by the way, I try to help out and I loaded the dishwasher and he's like oh. I didn't get Thank you I got oh. And i'm like it kind of like it. Attitudes or anything like i'm very sensitive to that so. uh right away, I felt offended you know and Sure enough, he goes in there, and he starts taking everything out. and put it back his way."
726.0,Provider,Oh.
13852.0,Patient,"And I I hurt my feelings so much, I was like oh i'm so sorry I did I. guess I didn't do it right, you know. And he's like no there's just a proper way of of loading a dishwasher and I know amanda's told me that oh cuz I go Oh, because I don't have a dishwasher so I just assumed I did it right. yeah and he goes yeah he goes yeah amanda told me that that you guys just wash it by hand. And I thought. Oh crap you slap me next time it might not hurt as much."
726.0,Provider,What me yeah yeah.
13852.0,Patient,that's just the way he is he talks to me like I felt like a two year old boy yeah it was like. Oh no.
726.0,Provider,"Maybe. No, maybe he's triggering you too, because you feel disrespected and you have such a history of feeling that way yeah that I wonder like if you were to be in a conversation or something were to happen. Maybe say something back to him, like reflecting back on how he's coming across."
13852.0,Patient,"I don't. I mean, I could try."
726.0,Provider,"But i'm just saying for yourself, it might help you feel like. Well, he was disrespectful but I didn't take it, I I like in a in a respectful way you kind of set something where you feel like you're not. Where you feel like you were take like keeping what's the right word for it it's like you were in a way, respecting yourself and saying something back you know what I mean. Like yeah did it like he didn't like go over me on this one, I said something to him, even if it doesn't go well just the fact that you vocalize your your. discomfort with him of something might be, because if he continues to do that it's because he knows you're not saying anything like if he knows what he's."
13852.0,Patient,"Doing Okay, I get it now right."
726.0,Provider,"yeah like if he knows what he's doing, and he just been in a hole, then then it's it's like it's like when you see a bully like bullies don't stop unless you really shut it down. And so I wonder if it's just for your own self esteem and your own feeling of self worth it, if you might feel good you might get like a good feeling of rush out of. Saying hey like why, why do you talk to me this way this is i'm not i'm just trying to be helpful, why do you have an attitude about it, you could just say to me that Thank you and and and be all set with it like he didn't have to go the extra mile to take dishes out. That goes."
13852.0,Patient,"yeah and and even his daughter that's 18. When I said that she was down in there, and she goes don't take it wrong because so maybe she even might have caught it because she goes don't take it wrong, I obviously don't know how to load the dishwasher either so. The little bit. yeah so It made me feel like oh he's just an ass Perry."
726.0,Provider,"I wonder, you know how there's people that are like obsessive compulsive he's very. I wonder if he has that because people that are like that are like very edgy and if you do something that they don't like it's not it. Sometimes it's like they're not they're not purposefully trying to be rude but they just really don't like it, and it has nothing to do with you it's it's them it's like totally then."
13852.0,Patient,"It is exactly what you just said, because that's why, when you said, will say something, because I sometimes I take things wrong, you know. But when she said that I realized okay he's just and he didn't like what was that I had made some breakfast or something and I was going to clean up, but he was doing something in the kitchen and I didn't want to. So. I went into the living room and then next thing I know I came in and everything that I was going to clean up he cleaned up so. I sent him I go oh i'm sorry I wasn't fast enough to clean up, I really wanted to clean up my own mess. And he told me he goes no i'm just uh he even said that word I think he said i'm obsessive compulsive. have my kitchen. Clean all the time and i'm like."
726.0,Provider,"Oh okay yeah you can then, then you know what Nadia in situations like what you're telling me I know it's really hard to do this, but don't take it personally because I i've seen this firsthand myself, he has absolutely nothing to do with you, nothing it's totally them. yeah yeah."
13852.0,Patient,"And sometimes the way he talks to is very. abrupt what he said something to and I kind of just kept to myself and then later I said, my daughter God he just got a little smart mouth about this this and she goes mom I was sitting right there he wasn't a smart mouth, I went oh. Okay. So then i'll just kind of be quiet and then it's just me. But. yeah I know it's him."
726.0,Provider,"it's get into a with my daughter, maybe she's just used to the way he talks."
13852.0,Patient,"i'm and i'm just kind of like Okay, because I know he was being a sort of very sarcastic about the comment, he had made with me and like you said it's just that's just the way he is that's what I was trying to say about his personality. that's the. way he set in his ways and he's very dry my daughter's told me, you know when I told I was a little dry as any and she's like yeah. So what it could be like some people do really well with different personalities, because I."
726.0,Provider,"Like I know if you're a person that's that like really in touch with your feelings and all this stuff like there's people that are. Completely like. flat like you can't get much emotion out of them anyway it's just and and usually people that are like that, because something has happened in their life that made them that way."
13852.0,Patient,"Yes, i'm thinking, maybe the way he was raised with."
726.0,Provider,"It has to be yeah I mean. there's like the saying it's like you never know what battles, people are battling and I think it's so accurate there's people that you would never think that have gone through things and then. You talk to them and it's like a sound that you're like wow I had no idea that this was what you were struggling when."
13852.0,Patient,"yeah oh and he's he's had a big one, at least, something that I would feels big. His yeah he had a son at nine years old, that died of leukemia."
726.0,Provider,"Oh, my goodness."
13852.0,Patient,"yeah so With that in mind. He treats his daughter like. she's gonna break. um I was the way he because she's 19 now she just turned 19. December 5 or something or another. And amanda had told me yeah it was her birthday and I go oh my God cuz I know she's a teen at the time, I went. So she 19 now and she's like yeah and i'm like oh my God, I mean when i've spent the night and like when she has to go to school, because she takes Community college, you know. She does have development issues. um, so I think, because the fact that he's lost his son and that she has development issues he just treats her like she's going to break and I thought oh my God, if my father would do that to me I die i'd be like hey i'm older and I don't need you to be up me."
726.0,Provider,yeah like.
13852.0,Patient,"He would walk her out to her car like when she's gonna go to school, when dad watched him and he's like Oh, let me walk you out to the car and she just kind of rolled her eyes and go. i've got all. But again, you know it's me the way I am and I have to learn that that because i'm so sensitive to feelings and know this and that and I was thinking. yeah with my past of being bullied. yeah you know what I mean I."
726.0,Provider,get it.
13852.0,Patient,I take everything very sensitively. So i've been learning with bright heart yeah. You gotta let that go.
726.0,Provider,"And you know what when you when you feel that way when you get into these interactions like that, like, even if it wasn't him, and there was someone else. Like recognizing the fact that okay i'm being more triggered because of my history like if I didn't have so really it's not even what's happening that's that's. triggering you it's the fact that it's hitting a nerve on on your past and that's all it is and then from there, you can say you can have like this conversation in your mind with yourself and say. Alright Nadia like he he's just hitting a part of you from childhood that that feels really like sad it really lonely it feels victimized because that's really like feeling like a victim that's really what that feeling is and it's it doesn't feel good it just doesn't."
13852.0,Patient,"that's why I say it's me I know it's me I know it's. I don't mean it like oh my God i'm just this is me, I mean. Like what you said, whatever just had happened triggered something in me. yeah that's where I need to. To be more okay Nadia it's not you, you it's just something that happened to you."
726.0,Provider,yeah.
13852.0,Patient,"And now you got to learn to be less sensitive, I mean I lost a lot of jobs, I got fired from a lot of jobs because of. So many things that would trigger me I would feel I was being bullied and since I was bullied so much and I didn't know any of this back when I was younger I wish I did. I reacted horribly and of course yeah you got to fire someone they got a mouth like that, but um. But yeah it's yeah I mean. In group there's a lot of younger, you know, like my my daughter's age and stuff and I think i'm the oldest one there, and when they say yeah you know i've got to be dealing with this and or that or this and i'm thinking yeah that's how I felt when I was younger, I mean. I wish I would have had you guys back then I wouldn't have love."
726.0,Provider,"That Nadia and think of it this way it's like like I know a lot of people say this but, honestly and and, like in the work that I do with other people if I suggest something it's it's because I also. To be to have integrity, with my work, I can, I can say I do I do my own work also apart from the work that I do here, and when I get triggered. I look at myself, and I think Why am I, being triggered like I don't like I will I will I have like i'll do a journal, and I just keep track of. Things that bother me things that trigger me and then I go back and i'll read and i'll be like oh now I get it, this is why we're now I remember why I felt this way like what happened. Was the feeling, because you know we get stuck in the feeling part and it's like the feelings don't help you resolve the situation. it's it's it's okay to like let yourself feel it give yourself time and then revisit it and think all right, how can I, how can I work with myself with this, you know what i'm saying. yeah so. So yeah."
13852.0,Patient,"yeah and and and you know I didn't know any of this until I started with bright heart, I I just because I was bullied so much I didn't realize that I was being bullied and that one word I just somebody was gonna make me pop. And that too is coming up with my daughter. that's when I said that word pop whoa yeah that reminded me of her, she popped off at me, and it was over, something really stupid."
726.0,Provider,yeah we're.
13852.0,Patient,"Over towels my washer and dryer working right now so she'll take my towels and she's been taking my towels to wash and I haven't noticed that. My towels weren't coming back to me only just a couple. Like, for example, I have a closet where I put all my towels right. Last year. I noticed that trying to put my towels and I was really shoving them in there. yeah and the other day I looked at it and I had three towels in there and I was like."
726.0,Provider,Oh you're like what.
13852.0,Patient,"was wrong with this picture. yeah so I wrote it wrote a note like hey I just put towels that are missing, and I started thinking and I looked around, and you know, and I wrote down which tiles were missing and I took a picture of it and I sent it to her oh my God. That triggered something in her. She called it pop off and she just you know went off on me and started seeing some very nasty things and. You know it's you know it's not like i'm keeping them, and you know it was all by text which I hate text and that's why he text. it's kind of like a book you read a book. In your head is a certain way that's why I like to read books, because in my mind i'm the villain or i'm this i'm that. yeah probably when she saw that no, it was accusing. Because the way she took it."
726.0,Provider,yeah.
13852.0,Patient,"The keys in her stealing my towels. and She really went off on me and like one of the part of the text really hurts like well it's not like you take showers every day, and you know you don't need so many towels and blah blah and. What did I say all I said is, these are missing. yeah so uh we didn't talk for a while it really hurt me um until I kind of sat down and tried to think of it at her way. that's What, finally, you know got me to think okay stop taking things so personal you actually did something this time and don't even know if you trigger here."
726.0,Provider,So.
13852.0,Patient,"With that in mind um I just decided, you know, I have a friend, that I was talking to and I read her my my daughter's text and she's just like. How can your daughter be so rude to you welcome your daughter treat you this way Nadia you know you need to do something about this and i'm like I don't know how to talk to her right now she's so, and this is what I finally realized she's so overwhelmed. And she's at that point where any little thing when she reads it is going to trigger something else. And she's she's really had a bad growing up with her dad her. dad is really just like basically outcasts are like. You know I have my kids and you're just my first one, but yeah these kids are more wharton. And that's the way she feels about that, with her dad. And I figured okay I got to look at this a different way you look at it her way. Maybe she felt you accused her so I sent her a text and I said. i'm really sorry about. The towels my note Okay, she was really a note how childish, so I said i'm really sorry about sending your note. I was not trying to accuse you of stealing my towels I just thought you have so much on your plate right now, and maybe you didn't even know that all these towels were at your House, so if you could please says, take a look around. And, and I did it that way, and now we're okay now we're better. word. yeah and and her word that's where she was her i'm sorry was i'm sorry I popped off."
726.0,Provider,Oh yeah yeah.
13852.0,Patient,"um another thing too we both have major anxiety problems she does too. And, and obviously has a lot of triggers because of her dad and the way he's treated her mom. So. i'm trying to look at things when I talked to her, because my friends like oh you, you need you need to tell her to you know have more respect for you and you need to like look. Maybe for some people that might work, but for my daughter, it will not work, no. yeah so being with anxiety she takes the same anxiety meds that I do. she's been off her meds I want to say for at least three months now. and I asked her you know because I know I can tell, because we're so like I know when she POPs off. yeah that she's having a problem dealing with whatever just happened."
726.0,Provider,And I know that.
13852.0,Patient,"In the past, when I was off my meds that's the way I would do too I would get roll around and. And when I would be off them and then, when i'm on them, I know the difference, I totally know the difference because i'll even be like whoa in the past, I would have. jumped somebody's throat. yeah being on the meds it really helps the chemical imbalance in your brain and. I think she's at that point, because she's so young, well she's 32. I think she's at that point, because she's not on her meds so I understand that when you're not on your meds you just every little trigger is going to make your mouth go. And I don't know how to tell her. Honey i've kind of noticed, maybe you're under a lot of pressure you really need to. talk to your doctor again and get back on your men's I don't know, should I say something."
726.0,Provider,"I mean. Only I would, I would ask myself why is she not on the medication like what and the other thing is the like. it's good to show concern, but also at this point she's a grown adult and if she's not if she's not like. You can help somebody but if they don't want to help themselves you're just wasting your time, you know what I mean like you can. Like I think people people want to help other people, but if you see that someone doesn't even want to help themselves. You can encourage them and say i'm here for you, if you need help, I understand i've been through this I can be here for you, whenever you that's something that you want to do, you can you can bring it from a point of concern. But um. But I would go lightly on it like I want. It cuz cuz then it, and this is a thing like there's people that like, no matter how you say it if they want to interpret it in a negative way they're going to interpret it, whether you have good intentions or not. they're going to. flip it and so it's like you have to really be really careful about how you approach that with her."
13852.0,Patient,"Especially her being my daughter and i'm. Her mom. she's gonna take everything I say like. Oh here she goes again and just you know so afraid and say, but maybe if I see it as a concern."
726.0,Provider,"also think of it this way she's highlighting for you all of the things that you yourself. Had as issues so she's just a reflection of your stuff that that's going on right and so so it's like you, you want to have the balance between being concerned for her but not losing focus of the work that you're doing on yourself. and Having that balance really takes work it takes a lot of like awareness of okay i'm now on i'm focusing way too much on this other person I need to really like koonin and figure my stuff out, you know."
13852.0,Patient,"yeah. I know it's like I said eggshells, maybe glass sometimes. yeah but I don't know you know, sometimes we can actually sit and we haven't had a chance because she's been so busy working. But before she started work we used to have time to sit together watch a movie together and everything in between, I would mention something, and she would take it okay. But now that she's working she's burning both can't both sides of the candle right now and dealing with the two children and. Everything. yeah um. it's like yeah I want to say hey girl I know where you're at i've been in there and I didn't have any meds and I didn't know I needed to be on meds she knows about her meds and when i've asked her in the past about are you on your meds. her answers been oh yeah I need to call my doctor and I just don't have the time or oh yeah listen that it's always like an excuse so. I just let it go at that point."
726.0,Provider,yeah yeah.
13852.0,Patient,"But that's been a kind of a strain on us right now with her working and offer man's you know i'm just afraid because she like you said she's a mirror image of me I know at that age, I used to pop off a lot myself and. I got myself fired a lot so i'm yeah. I don't want that to happen to her."
726.0,Provider,"yeah and remember it's like don't try to be aware of the those feelings, as they come up because you know the concern sometimes it's like. If she sees the repercussions of how she is and once she feels that it's negative for her and her income and her family, she will make that switch for herself because she'll say. All right, like it's not worth it for me to keep getting angry like this i'm going to find a way to to make this better, so I can be better so. I don't have to run into the same thing over and over again, you know it's like in every situation that you are in your life, it is the same thing is happening over and over again, the common denominator is you, so you have to look at you. And then figure out okay like there's obviously there's things that are not in your control and you can't control her you can only control yourself, you can see."
13852.0,Patient,"yeah. yeah I know it's funny my friend doesn't understand that, because she's she's 10 years older than me and she's just like oh my God, you need to talk to your therapist maybe she'll have something to tell you what to do with her i'm like you know what I I already know the answer. I know to back off and not being pushy because you're right she obviously got to a point where she did get on the meds and new. So maybe she'll get back. To that point again on her own and doesn't need any pushing."
726.0,Provider,"You know what to it's good for you to know how she you know if she's acting this way now, you can mentally prepare yourself, when you do interact with her, you can have that conversation and say. Alright Nadia we're going to go in and we know that she's going through a hard time and. bring up those shields of like it and not shield like i'm you blocking her, but you blocking you're like you're going to go in and you're going to prepare yourself and say I know this is going to be a tough. interaction, but it, but this is the interaction where i'm gonna i'm gonna just keep myself at a healthy distance and just be there and whatever comes out of her mouth.
