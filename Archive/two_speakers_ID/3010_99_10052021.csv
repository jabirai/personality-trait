3010.0,Patient,I was muted.
99.0,Provider,Okay. hi.
3010.0,Patient,How are you.
99.0,Provider,"i'm good, how are you good. i'm glad you showed up, I was like oh no where's windy what's going on."
3010.0,Patient,I know I checked in like a half an hour early and. Time does seem system boy. Oh yeah late.
99.0,Provider,So what would you like to bring in today.
3010.0,Patient,"All right, and there was something that I thought about yesterday and I can't remember. So. My mom came to visit me yesterday. So that was pretty cool I got to hang out with her and my little sister but. She did tell me that um my dad might have prostate cancer."
99.0,Provider,"you've had so so many people in your life has been sick lately, in the last year, so gosh."
3010.0,Patient,"yeah so I guess he wasn't just for a checkup and. Some tests that they got back were like. abnormal so they said, the only time that they see results like that is when there's a prostate cancer involved so they put medication and he goes back, I think, next week. So. yeah that kind of like I don't know. It just hit a soft spot because."
99.0,Provider,you're getting a little broken up all I heard was it hits a soft spot.
3010.0,Patient,"Sorry, my mom called. me."
99.0,Provider,So i'm. Like yeah.
3010.0,Patient,"Oh yeah like. I don't know I guess cuz like. that's my dad you know he's not my biological dad book. he's just always been there, and so it just like kind of got me thinking like. Like i'm not trying to say that i'm just jumping to negative conclusion drive away, but it does make you think you know. cuz. I mean we don't know. So I just kind of been tripping on that a little bit cuz i'm kind of just think like you know we just went through that with my grandma. And then, it makes me think about like. My mom and my little sister like. Where that would leave then. Usually heavy on my mind."
99.0,Provider,yeah It makes sense.
3010.0,Patient,yeah.
99.0,Provider,When when might you find out more.
3010.0,Patient,"And a week I can't remember if she said, next week or a week and I just heard week."
99.0,Provider,Okay yeah. yeah.
3010.0,Patient,"just stressed out on top of stress. And then my. know I didn't realize today, though, that i'm i'm. Like i'm handling certain circumstances, a little better than I was before like. I used to drink one the small shit a lot like like completely blow everything out of proportion. And like. Today, for example, I got a speeding ticket and I just got one like a couple days ago. Oh no so. yeah so I got sanctioned on drug court because I had police contact twice and they were both speeding tickets. uh huh um and I got kicked out of my class because they heard my daughter in the background. So that'll probably like they'll probably recommend that I get sanction for that, too, because they're just they're ridiculous when it comes to stuff like that. What happened so late, I was thinking earlier. um let's say they could be anywhere. From like a couple days in jail are. Like a sanction to go help out say they're doing a little event at the end of the meeting, are sometimes they have like oil runs and shit that they do to help out the Community. you'll have to go and do whatever it is, they have going on, or a couple days and Joe but you only get the gel if it's like something like serious. Or if you had multiple. Minor sanctions like over and over again, then they'll eventually. Just putting in job duties."
99.0,Provider,"yeah thanks well so so you notice, maybe you handled it better than in the past."
3010.0,Patient,"yeah cuz I remember like when I first got out, and I was just starting the program like I remember missing a class and um. I don't remember what else, it was a guy in a sanction for, and I was just like losing it like I was so upset like it was the end of the world. And i'm kind of just like you know. Whatever take it as it comes."
99.0,Provider,"yeah maybe I wonder, do you think that speaks to that you're feeling on some level, maybe more grounded and solid and it's like Okay, of course, you don't want this, but you can handle it."
3010.0,Patient,"yeah I think to that I just kind of like. i've been trying to pick and choose. What I give out my energy to you know what I mean or what I can and cannot control like what I can control of course i'm going to you know focus on it dwell on it stress on it, but whatever is out of my control I kind of just. brush it off, because if you can't control it there's nothing you can do about it right. yeah."
99.0,Provider,"huh well speaking of somebody your your daughter being in the background, and they kicked you out I wouldn't I wouldn't kick you out a group unless it was really significant and I noticed last week there's somebody in the room, with you and. i'm just i'm i've gotten so used to you really being present in group and you were present, I noticed, you were there and they noticed there's something else going on, so I just, I just wanted to talk about it, what happened last week."
3010.0,Patient,When I was in group. See oh I wasn't um I was at home that's.
99.0,Provider,uh huh. uh huh.
3010.0,Patient,yeah.
99.0,Provider,and
3010.0,Patient,I was was.
99.0,Provider,This oh go ahead.
3010.0,Patient,I was Sean.
99.0,Provider,"mm hmm I thought, so I could see I i'm a woman, I know what it looks like when a woman is and that's things, and you know you've been doing so well I didn't. call you out, I just wanted to talk about it today just you know one just because your presence is so meaningful in group, and this is also your time, you know it's I just want to to really encourage you to be. However, you can be in your own room, even if you're at sean's if you have to put yourself in the bathroom or in your car or whatever."
3010.0,Patient,yeah I know i'm not gonna lie to you about it all.
99.0,Provider,"I know, and if you lied I would know you're lying, because I know."
3010.0,Patient,yeah so.
99.0,Provider,"I you know part of me is very happy for you, you know whatever's going on i'm just happy that you're having some connection, so I don't want to just crush that and I also you know you've been doing so well I just don't want you to. to fall off your track with you know just being really committed to your your the time that you do devote to recovery."
3010.0,Patient,yeah though always you know stay at the top of the priority list it's. been kind of difficult like. Balancing everything I guess. But like we don't like. sorry that i'm like we are talking about um. I do have to make that room for like myself to. You know.
99.0,Provider,yeah definitely.
3010.0,Patient,"and never makes whatever makes me happy like. Just because I don't think i've. made that a priority for a very, very long time, like. pretty much been boxed off from you know everything except drug floor or my daughter like and there's nothing wrong with that, because those are are things that are you know priorities, but at the same time, like I kind of feel like it's. damaged little bit late."
99.0,Provider,"mm hmm. yeah yeah and I imagine it's a lot to maintain a balance with your recovery commitments your daughter work and then and now you know very I think appropriately weaving in time for yourself and whatever brings you pleasure, you know, whatever that is."
3010.0,Patient,"yeah definitely and then just introducing that you know, like even just hanging out with Sean like. it's made a big difference like I don't know like I, I look forward to all my priorities and being with my daughter, of course, to what I guess it's kind of just shed that little bit of light amongst all the chaos and day to day stuff that I have going on in I mean. it's just not know that there is someone there that. That just you know, makes me happy. Again, like I said, you know my daughter, and my family, and you know working and staying sober makes me happy to but I guess sometimes it's easy to get caught up in. just doing what you need to do, because it has to be done, that you kind of just forget about you know gratitude."
99.0,Provider,"yeah and we have all these different parts like you know you have your mother part that's one part of Wendy. Then you have this recovering part that's another part and then you have this woman part that's a whole different part you know which. It sounds to me that you're starting to tend to that part and it's healthy, to make sure that all of our parts are being met, however, what with whatever they need."
3010.0,Patient,natalie I agree yeah.
99.0,Provider,And windy i'll be right back i'm cooking something and I think the flame just went out.
3010.0,Patient,Okay.
99.0,Provider,"it's bad if it goes out, then I just waste all this propane."
3010.0,Patient,What are you making.
99.0,Provider,Making beans and rice for dinner.
3010.0,Patient,that's. That sounds really good.
99.0,Provider,So So what do you have been. Alfredo oh what's up.
3010.0,Patient,I said i've been wanting to make chicken Alfredo.
99.0,Provider,uh huh uh huh. yeah.
3010.0,Patient,"slept has been. A big. Priority to be lately I don't know. Like I. really have late, I was eating, but it just wasn't like enjoying food, it seems like the past week I just like oh i've been doing is eating and like stressed out make time to go and make Donald."
99.0,Provider,uh huh. Maybe some self soothing with food.
3010.0,Patient,yeah.
99.0,Provider,"What I realized i'm going to look at your treatment plan I don't think we've updated in awhile so let's see. So. Oh yeah Oh, my goodness, most of your goals we set for may 1 we're way overdue. So mo yeah okay so let's just go through these tell me which ones you've met. And if there's still some that you want to keep let's um let's let's say what will you tell me how long you think until you can meet that goal, so the first one is getting enrolled in college classes, is that still something that you want to do."
3010.0,Patient,"Definitely. I kind of just like had to push that to the side arm is definitely i'm like all my top five but um. I ended up deciding that i'm going to push it off until after i'm done with drug court. Just because between work drug court requirements, you know, and my daughter being at school in school at home. It was just going to be too much on my plate. So yeah i'd say yes i'm goal, but I push it off until like next summer."
99.0,Provider,"Okay, so let's let's make that a long term goal for why don't we check in like. mid September see where you're at does that sound good of next year."
3010.0,Patient,yeah.
99.0,Provider,"yeah that'll give that's almost like a year away so okay that's all right, how about how about getting your own vehicle."
3010.0,Patient,I did that.
99.0,Provider,"You did it okay great so that's that's right you've had and you've had some car issues. So let's. Say yeah and speeding ticket okay. So Okay, so that one will be completed um. I have deciding what to do regarding your living situation is still is that still up in question or no."
3010.0,Patient,"um no because I did get. Another trailer. and decided to stay where it's parked at now. So i'd say that when I was accomplished, because at that time that I said that I was like stressing on getting an apartment or buying a new trailer so I didn't accomplish lot."
99.0,Provider,"Okay, great completed well okay this one's good to it, this one says getting your dental work scheduled started and possibly completed so. You definitely got it stuff scheduled and started so that's great that can be completed, I mean yeah as a completed goal, and then the when when is your final surgery subset for it because. i'm all for that."
3010.0,Patient,That was going to be in March of next year.
99.0,Provider,Okay.
3010.0,Patient,"So look as I soon as I hit. Months i'm going on goal, and I know procedures on march of 22."
99.0,Provider,"Okay, so this is another long term goal let's say by by mid April we'll just touch it and see where you're at with that and how that went. Okay um how about you wanted to get your daughter's documentation in order her birth certificate social security card."
3010.0,Patient,I got that.
99.0,Provider,"You did complete it awesome good job okay. that's great you did that you those were your goals so let's how about let's think of four new ones that and then you set the date, and these will be more short term goals, like maybe by by December 1 or something so the next few months."
3010.0,Patient,hey um. let's go ahead and stay. get new tires for my car. Because that's definitely something that that's like probably number one right now my priority list of things to do.
99.0,Provider,"yeah definitely with winter, I imagine that having solid tigers will be important. OK."
3010.0,Patient,"And then. let's see. I want to say graduate drug court. Because i'm supposed to be done in December, but I don't know it's it could still run till January, depending on. Like the classes and stuff um."
99.0,Provider,Well let's check in like January 31 and see how that went. Okay.
3010.0,Patient,"yeah cuz that's that's top of the list, right now, too, because i'm so close to being done."
99.0,Provider,About two or three more.
3010.0,Patient,"Via shed. Because i'm like i'm renting a storage right now for half of our stuff what we're not like what we don't have room for so like i've been really, really wanting to invest in in my own little shed that I could pull up you know so i'm not having to pay every month for storage."
99.0,Provider,"yeah great okay that's good yeah they have those, like those little sheds that i've seen him at home depot and stuff these little plastic sheets that are pretty good."
3010.0,Patient,yeah. And then i'm. winterizing my trailer. So skirt. But the heating tape and cover the windows i'd say down because I need to get that done.
99.0,Provider,"Okay, great and that one, probably by December 1 for sure, because it's going to be called by then."
3010.0,Patient,"yeah. i'd say November, to be honest."
99.0,Provider,"Okay, great November what beginning middle or end."
3010.0,Patient,let's just say the end okay.
99.0,Provider,"Okay, great any other goals that you want to add or does that feel like enough or no."
3010.0,Patient,let's see. buy a new couch and that'll be.
99.0,Provider,awesome. And when do you want to have the new couch by.
3010.0,Patient,let's see December.
99.0,Provider,"Okay. Good. So, so we still have time and we can use it, if you wish, and if you don't feel like there's anything else, no problem is there anything else you want to explore."
3010.0,Patient,Nothing I could think of right off the top of my head um. let's see. i'm trying to think if that was all because I was thinking yesterday so stuff I know it was my dad that I wanted to bring to the table and. I think that was it.
99.0,Provider,Is there anything else about your dad that you want to talk about.
3010.0,Patient,"Not necessarily are you guys it's just kind of like. I hate to say it, but like it's. kind of brought up that fear you know. And I hate that because it sounds a week but. I can just put me back to a place like that I used to hate being you know it was like a big reason for me, using because I just do like feeling scared because it may need the leap. So i'd use to not feel like. And Tom told me like it was more surreal like I didn't have to ask her period like. cuz I just kind of look like, and I know it sounds bad because I should be negative about it, but you know i'm the type of person that's going to look at both the positive and the negative and prepare myself and bulls, because if I don't do that then i'm just not right in my head. So, like that's like just the only thing brought up. That place that I don't like the book. I just prayed on it, you know and that's really all that to my control when it comes to that so."
99.0,Provider,"um well I wonder Wendy if we can. Maybe take another spin on what you're calling week, and what I see as vulnerability and and it's very natural you know when somebody that we care about deeply is sick that some fear would come in of loss and and so i'm wondering. Just to kind of validate and give space for what you're calling fear, what are the needs that go with that you know, like if you were to lose your dad let's just flesh it out what or what needs would not be met anymore, or what would the What would you be losing."
3010.0,Patient,"A lot. kind of just like. My safe place I guess. Close like, even though we have our differences, like. he's always there and it doesn't matter, what I do or. Who I am you know he's a cop and i'm on the opposite side."
99.0,Provider,"Oh well, he's a cup."
3010.0,Patient,"So. Just with That said, like that man has loved me with out ever. putting that into you know, like he's officer in the streets that are without you know. Doing that I was doing, and even though all his you know coworkers we're constantly. just talking shit to him and talking down on him and telling him that he was stupid for taking in me and my brother, because we were users and we were into illegal activity, and all this and all that, like he still didn't care. You still always. Even if I relapse today and through everything all the progress i've made away, he would still be there."
99.0,Provider,mm hmm.
3010.0,Patient,"That it'll be all right, and try again. So, like that that would just be like. I don't know that'd be devastating cuz you know my grandma I feel like that kind of took half my heart, you know cuz. that's raised me, so I don't know I think that's what brings up so much fear is because, like my dad is the one that. You know my grandma left, of course, my mom like i'll always have my mom but. there's just that bond that's their. dad my dad was there."
99.0,Provider,"yeah and it sounds like he's someone who really believes in you like, no matter what choices, you make he sees he sees you and says Okay, just like pick your head up and try again."
3010.0,Patient,Exactly.
99.0,Provider,"yeah so that's that's huge and when you when you hear that and maybe imagine someone else going through this does that seem weak to you, or does it seem like a pretty natural response to what may be on the horizon."
3010.0,Patient,My heart says natural my head says we.
99.0,Provider,"mm hmm. yep, and this is where so much of the judgment comes in right or critics Mike I know i'll speak for myself my critic and inner judge is stuck in my head and my heart is just the feelers like there's nothing wrong with this, this is, this is my human my human part really coming through."
3010.0,Patient,yeah it's like a battle constantly between the two.
99.0,Provider,"Well, I think this is such an important part of your recovery of just like just talking about it and giving space for the uncomfortable feelings that want to be judged and and pushed away, you know."
3010.0,Patient,"yeah i'm always been on like just that just you know, like validating It is just not. Not silver. silver. You know hearing that is like that's what it is, is, I know that how hard it wasn't my garmin died, you know, because it was sober."
99.0,Provider,mm hmm.
3010.0,Patient,Like that's been the biggest challenge for me and being clean is dealing with loss. You know one right after next. Without any substance to know me out like you just have to face it yeah.
99.0,Provider,"yeah and that's part of it, you know these substances are to take us away from pain and. And you have, I mean the truth is, you have endured a lot of loss, you know, the father of your child is is put away and locked up for who knows how long. Still so that's a big loss and even though you know your things are shifting your life but it's still there and your your relatives it's it's a lot, and the fact that you've said, you have not used. For over a year didn't you say it's been over a year."
3010.0,Patient,yeah you're in a month.
99.0,Provider,A year and a month yeah that's huge.
3010.0,Patient,"yeah me at a time, I guess."
99.0,Provider,"So i'm just thinking of ways to keep moving with the the fear and potentially the grief, you know of what may happen, we don't know we don't know what's going to happen, but what would be some some ways to keep letting it out. In the next coming week or so, because you won't have. Any results for the next week."
3010.0,Patient,that's a hard that's a tough one.
99.0,Provider,Just.
3010.0,Patient,"Like I already found myself like trying to avoid it, you know, like my mom brought it up. Like I validated her feelings you don't give her a hug to comfort her but, like, for me, I just shut it out. shout it out just. want to deal with it, so I don't know that's a good question. Probably just pray. pray on it. on it and pray on."
99.0,Provider,It was.
3010.0,Patient,A lot me it takes a lot for me to just you know kind of like dwell in those emotions and sift through like. I don't think i'm ready for that yet.
99.0,Provider,"uh huh uh huh. Well that's a that's a that's a pretty clear and quick knowing just saying i'm not ready for that yet so that's I think we know how much we can handle at once, and you know, maybe that is just the truth that right now, you can't hold another piece. Do you do you ever journal, or do you enjoy journaling."
3010.0,Patient,Just. leave it there on the table for now.
99.0,Provider,"yeah I don't know if you heard me did do you ever journal, or do you enjoy eternally."
3010.0,Patient,"yeah I do. it's helped me a lot of times in my life I just I always tend to like get started, and then I have it a part of my daily routine or once a day and then just little by little, I did start. Just. throw it off the deep. end when I got out. Last December, I was doing it twice a day once in the morning and at night. And it does it helps."
99.0,Provider,"mm hmm um I actually had an idea I kept. Thinking you know, maybe writing could be helpful, but I don't think journaling is it, and then the idea came What if you write your data few letters and letters that you may not give to him. But just for yourself if and when you're ready to start letting the feelings move a little bit i'm going to give you that homework or task that when you feel. Like like really genuinely ready to feel what's in there, a little more deeply write your dad a couple letters and and just see what comes out."
3010.0,Patient,All right. I could do that at some point I can't tell you when but. i'll do it.
99.0,Provider,"yeah I just want to plant, the seed right now I don't think I don't expect that it's going to happen soon, because I really heard you clearly like you know you're just you're not ready to go there yet. But if and when you are that could be a really clear way to channel that that feeling and emotion into a writer, because I. i'm thinking of you writing Jacob, is that you're the dad of your child's name Jacob. said his name yeah yeah when you write him letters, it sounds like a lot was coming out so that could be a really effective way to let some of the emotion move around to death."
3010.0,Patient,"To and it did, how to like when I was in jail i'm that's kind of like how I made amends with my mom and my dad and my daughter's grandparents like I just wrote a letter."
99.0,Provider,To each and every one of them.
3010.0,Patient,"hmm maybe. it's better than journaling well, I actually give it to the person, you know, like i've been told you know trashy or Bernie or whatever, but it seems to be. Better for me if I just. Let that person me."
99.0,Provider,"yeah I mean maybe these are for them intended for them, I guess it's just not not putting the pressure on you that you have to give it to them it's it's more for you to be able to just let some things out."
3010.0,Patient,yeah yeah I yeah.
99.0,Provider,What are you feeling right now. You just take a moment to connect with yourself a little more fully.
3010.0,Patient,I think I would say. 10. but also a little bit of worry. So much to wear.
99.0,Provider,Like it's.
3010.0,Patient,"it's just kind of the back of my head, but i'm content I don't feel like i'm. overwhelmed by anything right now like to add."
99.0,Provider,"This is different, this is different than what i've heard in the past, you know when when a lot of different challenges are up at once. there's something new in what you're saying around Okay, this is happening and you're not overwhelmed you're you're just you're here you're seeing you really naming how much you can take on right now."
3010.0,Patient,"yeah that's like going back to what I said, like I realization earlier. Just of how. Like i'm coping with everything. I noticed the difference because well for shit like. Especially hearing anything about my dad like that it would just I would have been off my Rocker. yeah since I they told me that what. I just a I don't want to be in that place. Like I. Always sucks to get sucked into that dark place it's hard to get back out."
99.0,Provider,"yeah I almost I could be totally wrong, but I must think your grandma was like your first initiation well I don't know you've probably lost other people, but. grandma was was one big experience to you know move through that and and see what you're capable of, and maybe what you don't want to recreate."
3010.0,Patient,Definitely. I agree with.
99.0,Provider,So what is something that you can do for yourself tonight to just some self care.
3010.0,Patient,I think. I think i'm going to redo my nails that seems like. A good therapy for me.
99.0,Provider,yeah totally.
3010.0,Patient,I think i'll do that. And my daughter's cuz she has a picture day tomorrow. So I gotta. Get her and. she's.
99.0,Provider,"cool yeah so tending to your l's just your physical well being. Okay, when do you do you wanna do you want to think about when you want to have a session next."
3010.0,Patient,me see. it's all over so. Do you have anything next Monday.
99.0,Provider,"I do, I have um. We have a 715."
3010.0,Patient,Okay let's go ahead and do that because one days have been working out for me.
99.0,Provider,"Okay, great so. Yes. yeah. OK OK Wendy will come unless there's anything else. You a great rest of your night."
