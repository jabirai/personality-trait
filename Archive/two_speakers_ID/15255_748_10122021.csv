748.0,Provider,Thank you Hello. Hello.
15255.0,Patient,"hi I i've been saying hi hi hi miss glad this is a legacy that i'm behind my schedule, but you're not responding so i'm like I can't."
748.0,Provider,hear anything you were freezing and the audio wasn't connected yet.
15255.0,Patient,"Oh, I see."
748.0,Provider,"yeah I couldn't need that you were probably trying to say something, although I can't see your mouth so."
15255.0,Patient,"Right right, so I chatted with you because i'm like Okay, she can't see me she's probably not seeing me, so I better just go ahead and. Say hi to her. i'm i'm leaving i'm waving my hands. Today I apologize for being late, but um you know."
748.0,Provider,"Thanks for things do happen, and this is is this your first session with bright heart."
15255.0,Patient,"Yes, ma'am This is my very first therapy session yes."
748.0,Provider,"Okay, and they told you that today what we're doing is really responding to questions pretty much. Okay, and but you'll will definitely get some chance a chance to talk as well, so. I just want to start by saying, welcome to bright her and. I am Karen and I am. relatively new to bright hurt, just like you. Even though i've been working yeah and. Only been here for two weeks."
15255.0,Patient,"Oh, my goodness."
748.0,Provider,Both of us brand new. Obviously i've been working in the field longer than that but. yeah so um what is bringing you to break her.
15255.0,Patient,"Well, I i've been my doctor and my my my daughter's pediatrician both of them for some apparent reason. mentioned to us even a long time ago that my daughter, and I really need to seek therapy. Part of that is because you know we have a problem being that my husband my ex husband my daughter's Father abandoned us and I was 14 years ago. didn't have a chance to go to the to see a therapist, especially for my kid because, being a single mom here in California. there's just really not enough time i'm not saying that there's really not enough time it's just that you know you're a single mom trying to. earn a living, so you can pay your obligations and still you know raise a child and send her to a good school, you know and all those stuff so i'm kind of guilty that I did not put a time set aside a time for at least my daughter, to have the therapy, I mean i'm the bigger person. i'm the parent I should I keep telling myself that I should be able to handle this you know I. Can just probably tell my brain okay forget about happen move on, because you have a six year old to race in your own so years and decades had passed until, of course, she became a teenager and, of course, those teenage situations that arise. You know, becoming we're not being becoming friends like we used to when she was little and she's obviously growing up having her own. mind to make decisions blah blah blah blah so Finally we we did a lot require a lot. And I did not like that, and so that was the first stage, why my my doctor recommended that I need to see a fair therapist and her pediatrician said the same thing and me included so that was one of them, and my real. problem, basically, is is accepting the fact that there is really age discrimination here in America, because I, to this day I couldn't land a job i've been trying to. Look, for a job, since you know, we had that mortgage crisis in 2008 I got laid off the following year and i've been working i've been working as a legal assistant for almost 20. Some years you know, so I know the field, I have the skills, I have the experience, but for just the reason of my age, I feel that i'm. All these employer employer sternly down because they don't want to pay them. You know the retirement benefits or their retirement perks that I am to get in a short period of time when they can you know, obviously utilize that say my pay and get two people out of my pay and not to worry about. You know the the retirement perks as soon as possible, because they prefer to hire definitely people that are younger than me, which is you know understandable but it's just that you know it's hard to prove age mission. case here in America, you need to have a lot of a lot of votes that you, you need to write about why you think or why you feel you're being discriminated and you know. People to witness it and stuff, but of course it's it's it's a common discussion to people like me at this type of age or probably even older that that's. How older people, including me now feel so you know i've tried i've tried and tried and tried and you know always employers will use. That sort of like chance that oh yeah yeah we're looking for this particular you know person for position bubble blah, you know you go on for your second interview your third interview. To be told, later on, that oh This position is no longer available or the CEO or the head of the department decided that they're not gonna. want to open such a new. department, and so they don't need someone in that position, but will I mean all kinds of excuses just for me to feel really you know to lose for me to lose my confidence my self worth because I feel like, why is it that you know I go to all this, this some. interviews and I have several agents working for me and that's basically in the legal industry, you have to have agents to you know get through. into the system, so you can get in quicker and faster and and I always get turned down I the offer is not is not there anymore, when in fact. In the very beginning, they said yeah yeah we're looking for this, you know for this position, and you have the skills, you have the you know the experience blah blah, but then I just figured so what happened around that time. What made them decide not to hire me I passed the test I pass the exams and just like so what's wrong with me and people would always tell me, but you don't look old and that thing God that I. You know, physically I don't look my age, you know because I tried to take care of my age, because I want to have a job. But it's just that, when that application is being read, I feel I feel like that the moment HR human resources do see you know my my information my personal. mission and start typing in or yeah typing in my my information my personal information in their computer system they'll they'll see that oh my gosh she's already this old. she's very close to the line of six close to retirement and she's asking this much money you know so Those are the things that I worry that depresses me that that just. All those combination of why why why why and and I get said I couldn't sleep. Of course, being that you are you feel that way you can't focus anymore, because you you feel like you're no longer worthy of having to have that same job that you've been doing for the past two decades What would it be, I have the skills i'm still doing the same stuff. The only thing I can think about is. Be my age, because it's still olivia physically you see it's still me it's still the same me I have black hair black eyes brown complexion i'm still five feet eight inches tall, I may have probably put on some weight, but as far as my physical appearance they'll be. But what could it be. And that depresses me a whole lot, especially during the pandemic when you know you."
748.0,Provider,So I want.
15255.0,Patient,"yeah yeah I wanted so badly to to try it out there, but everyone is of course close some of them shut down. And then, granted that knock down the lockdown is is already lifted and people are the news are saying that. Companies are hiring Baba Baba but those are jobs that that's not related to the kind of work, I do right so i'm just saying Okay, I tried, I put in my my. My application online because that's basically the procedure now is to do it online I went to Indeed I went to monster, I went to all this, you know. websites, where there is a particular job that I feel, and I believe in i'm uncomfortable doing because. Obviously, at that point of time i've lost some of the skills to i've lost some of those skill set we're talking, you know years now. You know, we always tell ourselves that if you don't do one thing for like even a week you forget how to do that, you will have to try to recall and remember Okay, so what was the next step again."
748.0,Provider,Once I.
15255.0,Patient,"This key right. Then you'll remember, but if you're talking you've been away for years now, plus the pandemic how, how could I compete with the people that are still working so corporate."
748.0,Provider,Your I can really hear how stressful. That has been for you. So has that has that all contributed to the issues with your daughter.
15255.0,Patient,"Well, I say yes, because of course I have i'm the mother i'm the parent, I have to take care of my kids still I mean you don't just say because she's 18 years old and we're in America, we have to follow the American. way that okay you're 18 years old. leave the House we happen to be Asians and Asians are very family oriented we actually let our children stay with us until we can afford. To you know, give them whatever they need, and when they're able to really settle on their own and that's when we try to you know. Let the wings fly open and fly because that's our culture that's our cultural mentality. I mean we are here, living in America, yes, we tried to adapt because they say that when you're in Rome to do what the Romans do I mean America, I need to do with Americans do, but we try to you know still. In tech embed with our children, you know the the traditions, our traditions, our values are set the moral values, our culture, because. Regardless if they were born here that doesn't mean you are completely an American you are still part Filipino you're still Asian you need to know your your culture. Right, you know. So and and and so of course that's part of my daughter do because i'm raising a child. Right and."
748.0,Provider,"While I was asking because it sounded at the beginning, like this you're seeking help really came from was rooted in the relationship with your daughter to start both remote pediatrician and your physician recommending that you both get therapy."
15255.0,Patient,"right because that's basically where it all started it was the recommendation by both doctors, because I told you, Miss miss Clark when the abandonment happened in 2007. I was, I was told by several friends that we do need my daughter my daughter, and I do need to see therapy, but I just did not have to have time to do that because. I want, I did not have any help. My child was still a little kid that cannot be left alone at home, I need to find someone that I can trust her with someone that at least I know that I can say Okay, can you please you know pick up my kid. You know at three o'clock and take her to your House and feed her and do this and help her with the homework and I compensate you I mean that's not. that's not easy here in America, maybe in my country in the Philippines, yes, because you know. We have a lot of relatives there, but in America you're on your own so with me being alone, and I have a six year old child at that time. And my my job in the legal industry when they say I want you to work overtime, I want you to finish this I want this done by eight o'clock. I have, I cannot, I cannot complain, because if the question here is, do you want to keep your job or you want to lose your job, what choice, do I have, I need to keep my I will have to I will have to let go of my. My my child as far as her safety is concerned, because I need the job because I still need to keep a roof over her head and my head. and put food on the table for hers and mine and pay my obligations right what choice Do I really have I don't I don't have that choice. Absolutely."
748.0,Provider,So um so really it sounds like what's bringing you to treatment is a combination of depression stress anxiety and a long history of challenges. Right yeah.
15255.0,Patient,"It was it was challenge after challenge and it routed out like I said, with the abandonment. Here, and then not able to that therapy At that very moment early on. So I. have to wait until I do have the time."
748.0,Provider,"Right okay. And so. When you. have talked to people about what you're coming to treatment for what you're coming for therapy is it mostly mental health are there substances involved, or is there, addiction in the family."
15255.0,Patient,"it's mostly mental health most famous clock my family i'm glad and my when my mother passed away the very few last words she said was she's very happy and thankful that her children us. did not give her any problem as far as you know, being drug addicts being alcoholics being smokers and stuff that we were brought up to be good children. And that's something that i'm really proud of at the time that my my mom is already giving us her parting words and we tried me my siblings we tried to instill that same you know. way my my parents had taught us that we need to be this, and this, and this this you need to be that that that that that and thank God, our children my niece's my nephew my child. They are like us, we have no, we have no substance abuse, we are not alcoholics we don't smoke. I guess it's just this with with whatever trials and tribulations that would come our way, as far as our destiny in this life is."
748.0,Provider,Have you ever gotten any support or helping the past or is this your first time reaching out for support.
15255.0,Patient,This is my.
748.0,Provider,"First, it sounded like."
15255.0,Patient,"yeah because, if I told you, Miss Clark, I never had the time I really don't. But there was a time when I if you know California, there was a time that I was looking for a job, and I even accepted a job that was about almost an hour away from my house from where we live my child tonight, because I needed a job so badly."
748.0,Provider,I know i've done my thing.
15255.0,Patient,"yeah I took that job and I worked in the back of my mind how my child is doing, but I cannot take that worry in in my work because I need to focus on my work because I need to get. paid for my work and sometimes when they say you have to stay late, I stay late like 910 o'clock is the latest and for me to knock on that person that I entrusted my child with and when. She and her family that our children already asleep and i'm knocking at the door, can you just imagine the not only the embarrassment, but the mere fact that i'm i'm what's the word i'm i'm. Well i'm knocking on their door that. that's really just spewing."
748.0,Provider,"You know you're doing the best you could with the situation at hand, I know I worked as a single mom I worked to two to three jobs at a time, and I was gone all the time, all the time, which is what we want, with our children, we want to be with her kids."
15255.0,Patient,"Right, so you didn't have anyone to watch your children to are you are you like the same with the same situation, I was."
748.0,Provider,"I was, I was. I would you."
15255.0,Patient,know.
748.0,Provider,"I used the school resources as much as I could, and she would be with friends. When I was at work, and she had friends parents who offer just support me and they'd go pick her up from things sometimes but it's hard it isn't the way we want to be."
15255.0,Patient,"Right never I never dreamt that this is going to happen to me, I never dreamt that my ex husband is going to abandon me we all drank when we were young girls, that is going to be like the Cinderella story that your life is going to be happy ever after never in my life slightest. thought that this is going to happen and that's why I explained to my daughter I wasn't prepared for this, I did not know what to do, because I don't want to go in that direction, because that's not something nice to think about. You tried to be."
748.0,Provider,If she angry or upset about what you had to do.
15255.0,Patient,"See that's the problem, she and my ex husband are the same they're both quiet people that's why I cannot read into their minds."
748.0,Provider,What is it that.
15255.0,Patient,"you're thinking, I tried to open up communication with them, but they don't want to speak up. that's why it again that's word the irritation with with my ex husband to is because I keep telling him I don't know what's in your head. Unless you tell me what is the problem, or what are the problems we need to discuss about this that's why, when when I finally saw him after two years, that he never showed up showed showed us showed showed up to us."
748.0,Provider,uh huh.
15255.0,Patient,"I trade I just went straight and just said, why did you do what you did you know that we have, we have a child in between us, you know that. The person that's going to hurt the most is that child. You know we're both grown up the least that we could do a supposedly a husband and wife is communicate and that's been what i've been telling you is. You need to talk to me, because what I cannot read what's on your mind, you need to really speak it out tell me. Because that's, the only way we're going to resolve our problems, we were not physical we I was not physical to him, and so did he, but when I get mad that's where I guess I need to anger management Do I really say what I need to say it's because come on. we're adults, we need to be able to discuss something and find a solution to our problems, you know we both wanted to be married we both wanted to have a child. We are both supposed to be responsible in raising this child, this is not just one person it's just not one party like people would say it takes two to tango you and me we're doing the tango. So the least that you can do is still continue to tango with me and communicate with me, what is your problem, and not just leave us like this, not even a word, not even a note and then you show up after two years. What do you think of us, I mean look at look at those you know the elephants in the wild the the family giraffes the life, all of them. When one of their child is missing, they are looking for that child let's just give it simple simple thing the dogs and the cats when one of the puppies and one of their kittens is missing, what do they do, they look for them. And they will go home together. And that should have been."
748.0,Provider,"Common sending your job or your daughter, and her father connected anymore, are they in contact."
15255.0,Patient,"No, you haven't been in contact with with her at all."
748.0,Provider,"Okay, oh how heartbreaking. that's got to be hard for her. I imagine that's."
15255.0,Patient,best.
748.0,Provider,for you to witness.
15255.0,Patient,"Yes, and that's why the pediatrician suggested that she has her own therapy. And also, she needs a psychiatrist and I in, on the other hand, will have to have my own therapy to and like I said, had I not waited this long, how should I give time. Early on, but I don't have the time because I need to keep my job."
748.0,Provider,"Of course, so how how it has she responded, what are you witnessing in your daughter is she depressed is."
15255.0,Patient,"She she it really it really affected her psychologically, I know that there was a point in time when she even said that she wishes that to when she was a little girl. So I realized, I know that she is crying for help, at that point. Of course, and. I tried to just I just tried to go, you know seek help with my Bible support group to pray for her for the first. Almost first four years that we were part of this Bible support group to pray on my child more song her than me. You know and somehow I would think that the prayer help her in a way, but I really cannot tell because everything, just like I said she is just like her father very quiet she doesn't talk much and she doesn't show emotions and stuff like that, so I know. I know at this point we don't really have a good mother daughter relationship. and What can I do I keep telling her it wasn't your fault, and I didn't know that this."
748.0,Provider,well.
15255.0,Patient,"And and and I told her that if if she can just put this thing behind her you know this, this was our past it wasn't a good past let's just. Together, move forward together move on together let's work as a team, you know, trying to rebuild that confidence in her and. And just tried to think positive and she did went along with me for a while and, of course, now that she's past 18 years old, she realized that she can now try to make you know her own decision and stuff So what can you do."
748.0,Provider,Absolutely. was your family really connected and together what was your family like growing up.
15255.0,Patient,"We were really connected, when we were growing up, but I believe, as soon as we we came here in the States as soon as everybody started to get married and have their own children, and as soon as our parents passed on and there's no longer. let's say a mother, being the light of our family. or a father. Being the head of the family, no one is basically not no parent is there to watch over us then we all, I felt I really felt we were all on our own. We separated, you know, I have a family now, I have to take care of my children, I have to take care of my husband and then the other one says the same thing, and the other one says the same thing, and so I have no choice but say yeah well I. I guess i'm the one that's before say i'm the one without a husband and I have one child, so I guess, I will have to take care of me and my child. I didn't have any support from them."
748.0,Provider,i'm sorry to hear that. and
15255.0,Patient,"that's why I mentioned about the Bible study group because that's who came in and said to me, would you like to join our Saturday support group, because I can tell. That you are carrying such a heavy weight on on your shoulders on your own someone from this Bible support group came and approached me and said that."
748.0,Provider,So you have support from them now it's your new family. Right.
15255.0,Patient,that's one yeah.
748.0,Provider,that's wonderful and.
15255.0,Patient,"So the people from that group the men became canvases uncle and I taught because they know my story. So they know that i'm going to tell them that you act like the uncle to candace you cannot be to the father, but you can be the uncle and all the women there their wives became all the ante. And of course the elderly people became you know the adopted grandma and grandpa for for Kansas, because my parents already with the Lord, and of course my my ex husband's parents are not there to. Right so she has to have a grandpa and grandma please, please help me have to have a grandma and grandpa."
748.0,Provider,"sounds like you've really been struggling, I am going to i'm not sure what's happening i'm be Do you know what they told you, your appointment was going to be the time."
15255.0,Patient,I believe that my appointments are like an hour.
748.0,Provider,"that's what I thought, but i've got another person waiting to get in so i'm just going to go check and see what's going on here so that I can respond to the situation. let's see what day is this that is interesting so. yeah. Okay we're fine we're fine I still have a almost about 10 more minutes."
15255.0,Patient,"me. Basically, that this is basically the problem, the root of the problem, but more the depression actually gotten worse when of course I first lost the job in 2009 because. I was doing I was doing great. I was at the peak of my career miss Clark, I was earning a lot of money, and of course with that kind of money, I saved I saved and saved, because I know one day. it's going to be done and Sure enough, I was right right, so I was at the peak of my career and and all of a sudden. I lost my job in 2009 and I tried and tried and look for a job and what did what did what happened during that time, you can only have a temporary job. That, if you work for four months, six months, nine months, then the company that you're working for will offer you a full time job. Of course that's what all the agents in the legal industry was saying so, I have to follow whatever they're saying, because I need a job I need a full time job I need medical insurance for my children and my my child in myself right. So I worked for months, six months, nine months even 11 months, even a year. Just so the employer can give me a full time job because I need insurance, there was a time that candace and I did not have this my daughter's name did not have insurance doctor and medical and dental insurance for two years That means to say, we did not see. A doctor and a dentist for two years. Because I cannot afford to pay."
748.0,Provider,With cash exactly exactly.
15255.0,Patient,"that's why I am I am like. i'm trying so hard to land a full time job because I need insurance my daughter needs some dental work I needed a dental work. But I can't have it, you can have it."
748.0,Provider,So sorry. It is so stressful.
15255.0,Patient,"So this is now where the depression is about. Why are they discriminating my age that's what I feel that's my core belief that. Why are they doing this doing, why is the system doing this and i'm sure i'm not the only one who feels this way."
748.0,Provider,"Absolutely, and the whole the whole society, the whole culture has been falling apart because of covert on top of it. it's just so much to walk through and hold."
15255.0,Patient,"So i'm. i'm trying like I told you, I you know i've done. My online applications and I have yet to hear from any one of those companies that I have applied for so. This is where i'm at."
748.0,Provider,"So you just keep getting up every day and doing your best, is what I hear you keep trying you haven't."
15255.0,Patient,"Though no I haven't and I continue to pray I continue to ask the Lord please help me. Because I said I just have a couple more years when my daughter, as far as college is concerned, because I said, Lord just give me at least three more years. And by that if you want me to be laid off again, then so be it, but not now because you know she still needs about three years to go, you know I need as much help as I can, of course."
748.0,Provider,Is there any other field you're interested in Could it be that that might help.
15255.0,Patient,"Well, I tried, I tried to get into just you know, like a secretary job now. i'm in. The job because, like, I told you, I lost those skill set so i'm trying to go lower than what i'm used to now because. In the legal world, you need to have certain certain skills that attorneys expects of you to know, and I don't don't do those things anymore so obviously i'm that's already you know. minus for me right so i'm. Even seeking anything lower now just so I can get a full time job, just so I can have some benefits basically that's what i'm saying."
748.0,Provider,And that's not easy to do that is not easy to. not be in a position that is in your realm and your with your professional expertise I I can really hear how painful it's been for you and how scared you are.
15255.0,Patient,"I am, and I only have the Lord to thank for and I keep telling him, I know I know you haven't forsaken me all this time, because I do believe, when I tried to look back and and and. remember how I managed to do those things I don't don't think that I can do it on my own you help me I told him I know you helped me in some ways, because as a human being, I don't think I can do it you've done a lot of it. I told him and I thank you for that."
748.0,Provider,"that's beautiful that you can even cultivate a sense of gratitude, in the face of all of this challenge and pain. yeah well i'm really glad that you're with us thank you i'm really glad have they already told you what group you'll be in and what's next for you okay well when I finish up the notes from this, I will definitely. recommend and i'll hope with you that you can get started really soon, because you deserve support and help us you walk through this I know you've got your prayer support group. But this will be fools and other people and. will walk that path with you."
15255.0,Patient,"Thank you, Miss Clark."
748.0,Provider,"Lee, thank you for being so open and so. So honest with all that you're going through and I will think positive thoughts for you and your daughter, thank you, thank you absolutely it was an honor to meet you today."

748.0,Provider,I you know I don't know how they're assigning because i'm so new but that could be it could. Be what happens next.
15255.0,Patient,"Maybe maybe it should be noted them if you could know that for me please that i'm the type of person that whomever I start with, I want to deal with that person till the end because I don't want to read open all this pain again to a. person, so I you yourself said that I was so honest, because this is the honest that you can possibly get because I need to help myself. To my problems, so I don't want to bring that out again and be hurt again when I come home because I brought out that pain again, you see. I want to forget that and I want to be relieved from that and feel good about me, so I prefer that you can Please note that I just wanted to finish this to the end with you, please, please absolutely."
748.0,Provider,Definitely definitely acknowledge that in mind.
15255.0,Patient,"Because I don't want to feel this again next week and the following week. There has to be a solution to this, I cannot do this."
748.0,Provider,Time. It takes time. takes time I know we want it to all go away and the pain to stop I really do know that. And will be here to walk through it with you that I can assure you.
