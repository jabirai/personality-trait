12654.0,Patient,Okay.
416.0,Provider,i'd be happy to talk with her.
12654.0,Patient,"Okay, thank you yeah and another thing i'm i'm about to be done with them. With um. services for domestic violence."
416.0,Provider,Was there anything in those services that you've learned.
12654.0,Patient,Yes. Definitely yeah.
416.0,Provider,How do you feel like you've learned through that.
12654.0,Patient,"Two different to see the difference between answering relationship and. As as last safe relationship. So just today, we have a appointment with with the person who provide me the services and I was talking about the I saw the differences. Probably less I don't know if I don't know if it was the best way to to see this to compare it, but it was the way that I was able to see which one is the difference between an insane relationship and insane relationship, for example, the example with with this person was. In the past, I was in a relationship where about about two years, almost two years with a person in Mexico. This person was before I made my I met my. So that relationship was was in the distance we left in different in different states so, but you know, often it's simple, it was a brain a relationship because, for example, we both gave us our outer space. For example, we we understood that the space for person, it was really important so, for example, he never was. jealous person to me, without with for any reason, so that's at the beginning it was I was okay with this. So, but then later I was thinking like okay you don't care about me so here, the problem is tarik with this person and it started and started. But he told me, but you were okay with this with your space, you know that I love, I am this kind of person and he told me, for example, you know that i'm not a i'm not a jealous person because i'm trust you so. He he was wondering like, why are you why do you think that is not okay our relationship. So the problem is, we started with this person, because I was thinking there's there's worse are really a toxic relationship, because he he wasn't that interested person on me. So I wasn't he didn't laugh me. back. When I started this relationship with my husband, for example, he was really different he was, for example, he was more jealous he was more interested in my person so i've been up jealous personally was Okay, it was a big mistake definitely."
416.0,Provider,yeah.
12654.0,Patient,"yeah and when I when I saw that he, for example, was a jealous person I was Oh, he loves me oh my God."
416.0,Provider,You thought of it that jealousy meant love.
12654.0,Patient,"yeah and I was like, but I was thinking about these days and I was like that, for example, he was I did last year without any reason. I never gave him any reason to be jealous I called them be I wasn't able to talk with any men that he didn't he didn't know. And he would he get really, really upset if I talked to any men whatever that's married, so I didn't see this, so I was like now i'm like. How, how can be this possible, that you didn't see that this isn't, this is not this is wasn't OK, so this was an insane relation relationship between the other things, as I told you that the domestic violence, so the violence is started started here with us jello would be. Being jealous with bad words that I that I have the time let him to do it. Until started increasing increasing increasing to to to came here with the domestic violence of five physical violence. So I was definitely really, really wrong thinking it was a foolish a good relationship with this. And I was really, really wrong thinking that they altered relationship, it was a non toxic relationship in now i'm thinking like no definitely this was a safe relationship, and I was like oh my God."
416.0,Provider,Chang.
12654.0,Patient,"yeah I don't know if I can find the best way, the best way to compare but I, at the end I I did it so in it work to me to compare it to good at, to make a good impression to see the difference between a really good relationship and a toxic relationship."
416.0,Provider,you've learned a lot. Just i'm really impressed with how much you took away from that.
12654.0,Patient,"yeah and actually you know what I don't know it's it's like kind of like during the days during this time I have been thinking all about my life. On my high half pass on my life, so I don't know what why this happened that I started comparing to this to relationships and I was like no the first relationship was saying, the second relationship definitely it was. A toxic relationship and I can't believe how how I that I was really, really wrong."
416.0,Provider,wow.
12654.0,Patient,Yes. wow you've learned you've learned a lot.
416.0,Provider,"And it's you know these are the things, this is what this is what is good, this is what getting better looks like right it's when you go in with an open heart and an open mind and you listen and you think Oh, and you let yourself learn. And you let yourself. move through things and learn these important lessons and you carry them with you, that is, that is what healing looks like what a fantastic job you're doing."
12654.0,Patient,"yeah Thank you actually, this is a part of the plan for me that CPS had to me, but I didn't understand if they if they weren't wanted to talk about this, we do with the with a therapist or with. Southwest I don't know what would they."
416.0,Provider,"didn't was probably I mean they can talk with either of us, but I mean I love hearing about it and i'm also. One of the things that helps us like learn these lessons is to is to talk about that more right because you go to a class and you learn something important but then, if you just learn it and you eventually forget about it. Right that's one thing, but if you go and you talk to your therapist about it and you talk to your friends about it and then you're likely to remember it and really embrace it."
12654.0,Patient,"You actually just read my mom my mom came again from Mexico last Sunday and I talked her about this and and he told me, yes, definitely your world. She she told me this. And when I happy that I know i'm able to see the difference in in. be able to choose what I want to my life what for my life."
416.0,Provider,"Tell me about some of the other lessons that you feel like you've learned throughout all of this because they've been painful I know you've had a lot going on, or there's some other lessons that you don't want to forget."
12654.0,Patient,"Oh yeah another thing that I don't want to forget is. How, for example. How the domestic violence impact on on the child on the children, the children so definitely I can only I can remember a video that that I saw how the what is the impact that the domestic violence has over the children, the kids so. I almost I almost was about to cry to see this video. Because I was like Oh, my goodness, I can't believe I I for met that this was happening to my son, and I wanted to cry to start crying to see when I saw this video and definitely that's why i'm thinking for the next relationship in case that I. If I want another relationship to be brilliant really careful with the person I don't want. I don't want to hurt anymore to my child to my child, so what I what I learned so it's really important to keep keep calm. How to how to manage your emotions hard to take the contract and I, and I have been feeling much better with this definitely definitely. I have been failed much COM for example they're playing what i'm working now in a position where i'm working now at the beginning, when I was working over there before, when I was living with my with my husband. I was really, really stressed in this position. I don't know if was this just probably That was a stress with my with my with my husband."
416.0,Provider,When yeah i'm sure it was a combination of all of it.
12654.0,Patient,"Exactly definitely and I was really, really serious been there and now, obviously it continues, been a lot of issues that the Doc with the product or something like that. But you know what it's really different my my position that i'm now, for example today is like okay it's not my problem I won't. be mad, so I don't know I don't know that's that's not my problem I will do my my job and that's it definitely and I feel much better, to be honest with my emotions."
416.0,Provider,You sound a lot lighter.
12654.0,Patient,Like my.
416.0,Provider,Like you just don't sound like you're so weighed down and heavy.
12654.0,Patient,"yeah my mom told me the same that I I look I look better she told me look you look better in your sound better. And you know, then the other thing I believe is helping me a lot. My religion."
416.0,Provider,Tell me more about that. i'm sorry tell me about how that works for you.
12654.0,Patient,"For example, my religion i'm Catholic and I don't remember if I told you. yeah yeah and I have been assistant to the mass it's Sunday it's night before sleep i've talked to God and I hear the the word of the Lord of Lord and. This have have been has been changing my mind. For example, I. They talk. Too much about the. about how to forgive persons about the laugh. about the. How to be a good person, even in this circumstances. yeah So this has been definitely helped me a lot to be really, really calm definitely I believe it's on now I 9% that this has helped me."
416.0,Provider,"It sounds like it is, I mean I really hear that in you that there's in terms of forgiveness, are you are you finding it like you may be able to forgive your your husband for and forgiveness doesn't mean trusting them again and forgiveness doesn't mean. You know it doesn't mean letting them back in it just. means letting letting go of the anger right. Yes, do you think that you are are close to being able to kind of forgive under those circumstances."
12654.0,Patient,"Yes, definitely yes, yes, because, as I told you my religion has helped me alot and I have been learning that forgiveness it's really important now for them for us."
416.0,Provider,Absolutely that's exactly right. yeah therapist and your priest agree on this one.
12654.0,Patient,"yeah yeah definitely solid, the first, the first thing it's like that their religion and then my therapist would definitely I I said I don't know if you believe, for example in in this religion, but what I said in my beliefs is. This person like you, like the person is inside quest and the other person, the other people that have been helping me, for me, they are your angels. Yes."
416.0,Provider,How about maybe just work guides right we're here to. guide you through all that all the healing all of that wisdom it's already in you. it's just a matter of sometimes sometimes we need to interact with people and talk to people and find that peace in order to in order to find. What we already know and to be the best versions of ourselves that's what talking to your priests doesn't going to church it's also what talking to your therapist does.
12654.0,Patient,"yeah my mom told me the same. Since I began in the therapist with you. She told me like oh definitely the therapist is working definitely the therapists are working. For me, you look really different she told me that I looked like more a little bit happier a little bit. Different so different so he saw that it was because of the Youth interrupt this."
416.0,Provider,"Well, I mean you're doing it, though you're doing the work I talked to people all the time, who come to therapy with me. And they come every week, but then they don't actually make any differences, they don't make any changes in their lives, so they don't actually really put the work in to do it. And that's not you, you are going to the classes and listening and figuring out new lessons that will help you you, you know you really engage in therapy you do the emotional work to help you. To help yourself be a better person and be the best version of yourself that's your work i'm just here as a guide but you're the one actually doing the work."
12654.0,Patient,"yeah definitely yeah and you know what that's why I didn't want to change, for example, do you remember that I tend to grow up and they tell me if I want to change my turn up is as well, and for personnel in neither no. No, I want Julie."
416.0,Provider,i'm glad you chose to keep me I choose to keep you too.
12654.0,Patient,"yeah I think yeah because i'm really comfortable talking talking to you so definitely i'm really thankful for this, for all your help, because. It has been helping me a lot definitely."
416.0,Provider,"I see that are you remind me Diana, are you go into a group every week or every other week."
12654.0,Patient,I can't remember every week.
416.0,Provider,Every week okay.
12654.0,Patient,"mm hmm and another okay I talk about all the positive things, because this is the the goal, starting with the positive things now i'm going to start with a little negative thing."
416.0,Provider,Let me know laid on me let's do it.
12654.0,Patient,"Okay, so. I still having flashbacks with the police, remember that I told you, yes. One night I was, I was looking and was falling asleep asleep. And, and suddenly in my mind appear that I was driving and I saw a police behind me with the with the lights the lights are really, really present on my life, not the sound now they, and they also serve. The lights. are really, really. On my mind, in one way. And now you walk and I woke up really i'm like afraid. Okay, in I don't understand, I would like to know what is. What why this continuous. afternoon my on my side on my mind I don't understand."
416.0,Provider,"Would you believe me if I told you it's normal. it's actually pretty normal given way, I mean it's a it's a normal reaction to a horrible trauma."
12654.0,Patient,yeah definitely I believe it is this trauma that I have.
416.0,Provider,"yeah absolutely yeah it's a normal reaction to a trauma that you experienced and it's happening, mostly in your sleep or other times you."
12654.0,Patient,"know just just that day, and the other day, remember, I told you that. I was."
416.0,Provider,driving.
12654.0,Patient,To the gym that I saw them yeah mm hmm.
416.0,Provider,"So here's what I can I can I am. I have a couple ideas about what might help. with us, but I wanted to see if you mind, is it Okay, if I speak with my clinical director my boss. Who knows more than I do, I want to see, I want to run my ideas by her about how to help you on this. And, before I introduce them to you because I want to see if she thinks that they're a smart way to go, or I don't because nothing I do I don't want anything I do are introduced to you to harm you more right we don't want to make it worse. So I have some ideas about it, but I want to talk with her about it first and then maybe in our next session i'll i'll fill you in, and we can decide i'll have the information from her, and we can decide what to do."
12654.0,Patient,"Okay, yes please because. i'm it's just not only for example I can I can I can be talking to you right now in solidly. In I picture appears on the in my mind. With the with the lights. So I talked about this with the person who's helping me with domestic violence. And I told her that. it's a big trauma that I have because. They have the police have. For example, I that that night I felt like the worst criminal that they found. That was the army, I logged. In. I told you. I can, for good. Reason like baby. cry. yeah."
416.0,Provider,I was deeply traumatic for you.
12654.0,Patient,"it's it's really harmful for me. And I don't know how to manage this. Anyone, for example, I have been watching videos and YouTube talking about their forgiveness to myself. And I saw one one video that we're talking about the forgiveness for myself and the video says, you have to forget you to yourself. What you did in the past and what you didn't do isn't the battle ready. You have to start living now you did the best that you considered in the past was the best so. stop thinking about that your it's all your fault or your fault, just forgive you to yourself. So I have been trying to do this. I have been working to do this, but sometimes is, as I told you suddenly is. yeah pictures on my mind it's. On wanted, so you know. And, for example, another experience that I buy that it happened to me, I was working it was. I didn't I don't remember if I get was just today, I wasn't a job or the work and. I went to the bathroom. And suddenly suddenly I started remember again. What if this happened to me again. And I started praying when I was in the bathroom. And I was like why why he's happened to me this. If I not up a person. And I was talking to God and I was like wondering like. Why. Are. You. You let that Brian. is making me too much too much harm is harming a lot. What you let that brain is trying. To give away my baby from my side. I had the opportunity to do the same to him, because he was. As I told you, it was a victim of domestic violence, so I could I could do this call, and I didn't want to, because it was he was he is the father of my son. he's not thinking about about me about his son, so in my was crying crying. But then I said. They are now you have to go back to work, you can be you can be crying anymore, and I was like I don't want to go back to work in either myself or not, you have to you have to so I clean my face and I went back to work. And I talked about this to the the trap is the call to the controller. Inside of quest and she told me, it was a really, really good effort. Because. She told me i'm really impressed. She told me because you were able to go back to work even you didn't you didn't feel okay."
416.0,Provider,So. How often are you getting these flashbacks.
12654.0,Patient,Like. About. One or two ice 111 day blue week.
416.0,Provider,And it's almost always because of the light spray.
12654.0,Patient,"yan absolutely I don't have to see, for example, the the light sometimes that i'm impressed is because, when I was sleeping already I wasn't sleeping. And I was coming."
416.0,Provider,"OK OK so um. So here's what I What I do know that can help you and i'm going to talk to my director about this as well, but. um one of the best ways to help during a flashback is to do what we call grounding techniques. grounding techniques are ways to remind us to bring us because flashbacks can feel like you're right there again. All the sensations all the feelings right it's all it's like you're right back in that spot. Do you feel like that."
12654.0,Patient,mm hmm.
416.0,Provider,"Like you're right there again Okay, so we got to shock our brain and we're and remind our brain that we are not in that spot anymore in those moments. So people do people do that in different ways."
12654.0,Patient,mm hmm.
416.0,Provider,And sometimes people will do it by grabbing Ahold of an ice cube. or chewing on ice.
12654.0,Patient,mm hmm.
416.0,Provider,"Touching things that are cold whatever's around you touching things. saying to yourself, I am here, I am here i'm right here i'm right now it's. i'm safe this isn't what's happening anymore right all of those things, help the another way to do it is some some girls, where the rubber bands, the hair ties around the wrist and snap them."
12654.0,Patient,uh huh.
416.0,Provider,Because that's it that little bit of discomfort kind of shocks you into your body.
12654.0,Patient,No okay.
416.0,Provider,"You can do it by taking an ice cold shower. we're super hot shower whatever it is temperature usually really helps so trying to ground yourself and bringing yourself back and we're being like I am right here, I am safe, I am not there anymore."
12654.0,Patient,"yeah I remember you told me that is what I have been doing, because that day that it happened to me this just a day at work, I did this, I said, like you're okay you're here you're nothing more in that situation. That you're working on it so that's why that was the way that I will, I was able to come back to work, good."
416.0,Provider,"You can also you know, make sure your eyes are open and start out loud naming the things you see. naming the things you smell the. Things that you can touch. Right we're just reminding yourself that you're here and not there."
12654.0,Patient,Oh yeah it's the same the same same gave it to me that. The partner for safe quest to say.
416.0,Provider,Okay. we're on the same page okay.
12654.0,Patient,"yeah she told me Okay, this is she told me this is for like when you have a untidy and I forgot the world."
416.0,Provider,And an anxiety attack yeah or panic attack.
12654.0,Patient,"me she told me It started with like tell me three things that you that you can see. The same that you can smell of one thing. You can touch hot yeah. yeah tell me that it was a good. tip if, in case that I. i'm going to die for I believe i'm going to stay in that attack inside you have talk."
416.0,Provider,"I agree, so I mean and it doesn't just work for anxiety it's great for anxiety, but it also works well when you're having a flashback so to pull you back."
12654.0,Patient,"I will try, then for the next and, hopefully, hopefully. Hopefully won't be necessary, by."
416.0,Provider,"I will not so Diana and we're almost at a time, but I want to make sure we have our next appointments set for October, are you ready for that."
