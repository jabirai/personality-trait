So today we're going to do kind of like a get to know type session and won't be lengthy won't be really long because it's just an initial session. i'm going to actually i'm ask you a few questions, just to kind of get a baseline of how I can better treat you. And if at any time any questions that I asked might be uncomfortable for you just let me know we don't and we can just stop and move on and come back today at a later date, if at any moment that you have any questions for me feel free to ask me okay. So what brings you the treatment and why have you decided to come now."
16399.0,Patient,"um so it's kind of a combination of things, but I think the one of the main things I really would like done finally is get diagnosis diagnosis diagnosis is. already say that. Because I have yet to be like i'm 22 years old and i've tried for like six seven years to get diagnosed for things like ADHD. Even my depression isn't even it's only like formally diagnosed but it's not like actually been a diagnosed thing, but I know depression and just like other things like that and. And i'm wondering if. I can also get help if this is a mental health really issue if I could also work on my fatigue issues. Because i've had that since forever ever since I was a kid. And like motivation and stuff like that I guess if that makes sense."
740.0,Provider,"mm hmm. Okay, what it sounds like Oh, it looks like you look you had a session with domini not too long ago."
16399.0,Patient,yeah it was just like the introductory session kind of told her the same things.

16399.0,Patient,"yeah so i've been taking all of those and I got the wellbutrin from my school psychiatry list, but that wasn't very like a in depth situation she kind of just. me on it so."
740.0,Provider,"So says. You had a previous diagnosis of major depressive disorder were complaints of any attention focus and concentrate saying want to give screen for different mental illness and things you have ADHD or concerns or lack of motivation low energy. Problems with memory and difficulty following directions try to do one task at a time, but tends to merge tears. Having constant fatigue and drowsiness even with no sleep."
16399.0,Patient,Okay yeah.
740.0,Provider,"All right, give you any any history of substance abuse at all."
16399.0,Patient,"um. I don't think so no. cuz like I rely heavily on like marijuana for. Like mostly for sleeping but also for like mood regulating. I don't. necessarily know if that's like it'd be using it, because I can also live without it, but to live without it so. I don't know if that counts."
740.0,Provider,We do any history of suicidal ideations homicidal ideation so so far.
16399.0,Patient,"um when I, the last time I had a suicidal thought was when I was. 15 or 16 I haven't really had like a serious one, since. No homicidal tendencies I don't plan on hurting anyone."
740.0,Provider,"Okay, good deal so i'm to now for national name, because I don't want to Blitzkrieg."
16399.0,Patient,Just like PS.
740.0,Provider,"Okay Okay, my dear. i'm so What was it like for you growing up what was your family life, like."
16399.0,Patient,"God, where it began so first of all my parents and I came to the US as refugees from. Former Yugoslavia. So a lot of intergenerational trauma right there. I have a very misogynistic dad and a very mentally ill mother both who have ptsd from their own separate reasons. I remember like always trying to intervene like when I was really young like through their fights and stuff that we were kind of stable. My dad relied a lot on other people, so it was kind of like we were stable we weren't able to work. And then my dad left when I was. eight and then it was just me and my mom and my mom had to like. We were very poor essentially like we were under the poverty line, like below below below. Like my dad was off doing his own thing my mom was like struggling and that also like was. Another burden on her mental health, so when I was a team, or like a preteen that's like when our relationship really got strained I think she. Like I think that she was taking out her anger. To my dad through me so like I think she just assumed that a lot of what I do is through him, which is very not true. And so kind of just been doing that, with her i'm actually. In a very huge fight with her for like the last year and a half, basically. yeah it's been a really intense one but um but like by the time so when my dad left we moved to California and I had like no friends up until middle school so that's what led to a lot of like the suicidal. thoughts The self harming episodes. And just mental destruction essentially. And, by the time middle and high school came around I think that's when my mental health started to get better I really tried taking initiative for my mental health and like. yeah anyways So when I went to college that's when my mom and I kind of got a new rift in our relationship so i've just been dealing a lot with that. My dad is just constantly disappointing. But right now, I think, is like the most stable i've been in my life and i'm like 99.9% all on my own. But at the same time now that i've had time to work on myself there's just some things I still need help with so that is why i'm here and I hope that that history made sense and it wasn't just droning on and on."
740.0,Provider,Time.
16399.0,Patient,I hope I gave you the information you needed.
740.0,Provider,"Absolutely, and how many siblings do you have."
16399.0,Patient,i'm the only one.
740.0,Provider,The only one.
16399.0,Patient,yeah.
740.0,Provider,"So. Basically. You in a relationship is this strange. Your mom y'all been fighting for a year and a half, so now it's just you. So who do you turn to for support, do you have a support system or."
16399.0,Patient,"i'm not know. Like I I do rely heavily like on my friends, since they're like my friends are the only way I can have like a surrogate family in the States, because everyone else's you know back home. So I don't necessarily like have anyone that I feel comfortable enough to like go to these issues with, especially since a lot of my friends can't like relate and don't really know what to you know say. i'll be like oh this my life and they're like. it's kind of like I don't know who to turn to in these moments."
740.0,Provider,You can turn. To me.
16399.0,Patient,Know Thank you.
740.0,Provider,"Of course, you know until you find me, let me go. Oh yeah so any history of any one of the home struggle with mental health substance abuse eating disorders anything like that."
16399.0,Patient,"yeah everything, so my mom actually when my mom was pregnant with me and up until my dad left so like for. Like more than that decade, she was anorexic. She was like 40 pounds underweight when she gave birth to me. yeah and she still holds those same like the same mentality about that kind of stuff and so, like, for example, like she will Oh, I always remember like growing up, and she like grab different parts of her body that she like hated and like would show."
740.0,Provider,It to me and being like.
16399.0,Patient,"yeah isn't this so ugly and i'd be like Oh, are you like what would. You do and. And in the first half of college. I graduated earlier this year so i'm done with that so in the first half of college, I was on the pill, and it made me gain like 50 pounds essentially. And my mom would just not stop commenting on it, and like just wouldn't understand like because I kept telling her not to but she kept doing it and so she just has this weird obsessive like eating disorder mentality. I guess you'd say and she's still I don't think really recognizes it to this day and she's 47 now. yeah definitely she didn't have a really good life growing up so she has like a lot of her own other mental health issues, I could speculate what she has but she's also I don't think ever has had a professional diagnosis. My dad growing up, he was fine up until the war happened and then ptsd and narcissistic tendencies and we'll all that. And my grandparents are just miserable my aunts uncles are like. miserable I guess so yeah a."
740.0,Provider,whole lot of misery.
16399.0,Patient,yeah yeah essentially.
740.0,Provider,So um congratulations first off a graduate from college.
16399.0,Patient,Thank you.
740.0,Provider,Major accomplishment love to hear that i'm outside of that what was school like growing up for you.
16399.0,Patient,"very hard, so I I my English was very messed up when I was younger like when I first went to preschool and kindergarten because it wasn't my first language so communication has always been a really hard thing for me like getting my thoughts across properly. Understanding like understanding directions like from teachers properly or like understanding what exactly an assignment was saying, even though I could read it perfectly. So I like kind of was like a straight a student, but like nothing was really being retained because I just didn't understand like I I finally understood that books tell you things when I was like in the fifth grade."
740.0,Provider,And I was like.
16399.0,Patient,"10 I was like oh there's information in here. And yeah so that was hard, I still suffering from those effects, to this day, like I have. Hearing cognitive issues where it's just like if someone is like slurring your words too much I just cannot. understand what they're saying at all it's very hard for me, or like if someone is saying something like really fast to me like an order or something and i'll be like what did you just. Say yeah there is that. And then, other than the constant bullying that I experienced when I came to California. Nothing else that I can really think. So that was my school life essentially."
740.0,Provider,"um, what do you believe what."
16399.0,Patient,"I was different. So when we when we are refugee program placed us in Ohio so I was there for like the first seven years of my life, and then we moved to California. And the kids. In Ohio we're very. Different than the kids in California. kids in California, are very mean. Very like territorial very cliquey like I was beat up a lot, I had to like beat up other people in order to see myself. Like yeah so just didn't really have any influx of friends again up until middle school, so I was always like degraded for like my art like things I was always fascinated in. And just the general way, I like talk and like show affection, like all of that was just like something that everyone constantly would bag me on so."
740.0,Provider,Like.
16399.0,Patient,There was a lot of self confidence that I had to work through with those kinds of self expression type things. yeah kind of like across the board with all of that.
740.0,Provider,And I thank you for sharing that with me. yeah i'm. Bring for it.
16399.0,Patient,Really.
740.0,Provider,"Does you ever struggle with learning disabilities or anything i've been in school, I know, with the language barrier there's one thing, but any any issues with learning and retaining information."
16399.0,Patient,"I think it's more on like the retaining end of it like, especially now, like now that I just finished college. Aside from like what the pandemic affected. there's a lot that I, like my brain will learn something and then like when it needs to learn the next thing it's just like okay throw away this thing so like not a lot. ends up getting stored essentially so half of my college experience i'm like trying to like remember like Oh, how did I learn that again, or like oh what was that theory, or what was that I don't know let stuff so retention."
740.0,Provider,Absolutely I don't remember anything. From rascal.
16399.0,Patient,You doing better than is.
740.0,Provider,"It you know it qualifies me to get where I am. But. Okay, so. any financial or in your legal issues you're concerned about currently."
16399.0,Patient,"A financially i've been struggling struggling a little bit my. I haven't really been getting a lot of hours and so. i've just been kind of accessing the squirrel fun lately. and That does have an impact on me but i've learned to like not have it be as like. Like i'm not going to have a panic attack over in like how I used to in the past, like. yeah if I even lost like $15 like that just fell out of my pocket like that would cause like a whole episode for me excited just yeah so now, not so much because I know how to make money it's just more getting that money. So financially yeah."
740.0,Provider,And are you currently in a relationship.
16399.0,Patient,I don't know.
740.0,Provider,Do you live alone or who do you live.
16399.0,Patient,I live with my two roommates.
740.0,Provider,"yeah Okay, and how is it that made me."
16399.0,Patient,"um so actually the three of us we just moved out of a really toxic environment that included two more. roommates so like there was five of us, in total, one of which I ended up having a fistfight with. Like."
740.0,Provider,You just find it about.
16399.0,Patient,"well. I i'm classy she threw the first Punch and then I retaliated so. Sorry, but uh yeah so we just got out of that that was something that the three of us like had been working on since the beginning of this year. Being in San Francisco it's hard to find like really good housing so when we finally found the spot, with we just took it so now we're in a very much, much safer environment less toxic and we definitely trust each other, like the three of us so."
740.0,Provider,So you so you do have support.
16399.0,Patient,yeah just not for like emotional stuff.
740.0,Provider,"Okay, so. Peter what are some things you want to work on why you can treat me."
16399.0,Patient,"Like. In terms of like the. Well, can you narrow down that question for me sorry."
740.0,Provider,"you're the first person who ever asked me. It is. Whatever so, and this is the question that I asked, because the thing about it is you don't have any goals set for yourself to achieve in treatment they will be doing. Sure right. If you're not trying to accomplish anything treatment know what are we doing as a baseline as people what they want to work on which is basically what their reasonings are for company treatment. Now, in regards to being diagnosed dominic you do there."
16399.0,Patient,Okay okay.
740.0,Provider,"i'm you know i'm saying, but also other things, you will like to work on or other defects over heavy so things you would like to you know that you see a trauma or whatever, so it just anything that kind of. That you feel like by basically has crippled your your life or cause you to be stagnant and I progress like you need to."
16399.0,Patient,"Okay, thank you, that definitely clarifies things. So. i'm. really sorry. I guess. And some ways. to reaffirm myself, especially like. validating myself like that my my feelings are to be considered. Like because, especially like in the context of my parents, I was not allowed to otherwise that that meant that I was defining their opinions, always so i've had a really hard time on my own trying to establish like my own voice, I guess, if that makes sense. So I would like some help with that. And I guess, I also want to learn how to. Because like i've been learning how to be content by myself, but it hasn't progressed to the part where i'm able to do things by myself. If that makes sense, so like i'm comfortable in my own company, but normally, like other people motivate me to get out of bed essentially like for the day so i'm trying to. figure out how how I can do that just by myself and not have other people be my only motivating factor in my life I guess. Sorry, I wasn't prepared for this question."
740.0,Provider,"I notice one maybe you want to start right there this fine always I got the time to think about more thing. I tell people a lot of times it just shooting plan is not set in stone, he can always be changed, and it cannot be modified. And so anytime down the road you figure out you find out that hey nice i'm approved improving in this spot within an awesome when I saw I saw some US DEMO so now, I need to work on is. Just feel free to let me know like I said nothing is set in stone here i'm so. um. One of the things so you do have homework that's all right with you. Okay, so in regards to in regards to the every boss of the dependency. Basically that's what it is when you're dependent on other people to motivate you to do something every boss that independent see I kind of want to know where they stand from how did they get started. You know where did they begin and How has it impacted your life now it's we used to have to be dependent on people."
16399.0,Patient,"yeah so I believe the source of that. Not only being like an only child, but like I. Like I was left alone, like a lot because, like my mom was always working my dad wasn't around. Like. yeah like there will be times like where i'm home alone for Christmas or late for other holidays i'm not necessarily religious but, like you know I as a kid I wanted to celebrate these things. And like. I just yeah I didn't. Like not didn't have a lot of people around me to like share these kinds of experiences with. And in middle school and I did find friends that was like life changing for me like literally life changing and I guess like then from there, I. based. Like. Oh God I don't know how to explain this."
740.0,Provider,that's why I say this for homework.
16399.0,Patient,Okay okay yeah so. Just write an area from there. yeah we'll write that down.
740.0,Provider,"So yeah from middle school when you begin to gravitate towards friends, because it sounds like there's some people pleasing baby in there, so I just want to, I want to kind of target that a little bit and see what's going on with it. And can explore. Because the dependency also does, excuse me, the divinity also. Excuse me. The dependency also relates to the self esteem issues that you vocalize as well, and the boundary issues that you need to implement, so it all kind of it all kind of works together."
16399.0,Patient,yeah and so.
740.0,Provider,"So we'll just start there like I said let's go start let's start from middle school in regards to the pig and see just kind of write it down how it came out to how it came to be how it was birth and how it has basically. Had a ripple effect on your life now to where you still find yourself being dependent. Okay. in regards to your next session, do you want to schedule it or do you want me to schedule for you."
16399.0,Patient,um can I schedule it with you now. yeah okay yeah that works.

740.0,Provider,"yeah basically two is only four weeks or a month. Okay, every blue moon that you get. That you get a fifth week. Okay. I mean that's fine if you ever feel the need did like Okay, when I shot think I need to see your weekly and just say weekly."
