When I talk to my friends today and I tell them about that story they're like Why is lane calling a boy like being added in like really pay attention to that type of stuff until I got to high school. School school wasn't high school it wasn't bad boy, it was down in Asia school so. Okay yeah so they asked all type of questions allow you to do like this, like. So do this or. Does your family do this by just fight and also finding, who I am and I guess i'd be more comfortable with my race. And coons like it was a lot like it was a lot like at one point I thought I was Asian going I thought it was Mexican. All I never didn't think I was like i'm never denied be in black, but it was always black something else, like. But, obviously, probably because it was like. me trying to be acceptable back in like because it was it was a lot it. was all types of races in everyday somebody like some some type of racially gateway some something is almost like a more. Like racial intent behind it, but nothing to be worried they're literally calling me the inward blade when I look back now I used to I mean, for instance baby like day was actually races like.

I guess you know people can change everything growing figure out, you know more educated on this topic topics boy, she has asked me to hang out recently and I just. I don't know if I want to do, because I I sit there and I think imma bring up this stuff that she used to say in high school, so instead of me like actually even now i'm just like avoiding. hanging out with her, because I don't I don't know how I feel about it, I don't think that it's fake of her to now be all black lives matter, and so I. also want to let her know like you know back in the day used to be going to like races. And i'm pretty sure she'll probably apologize and be like yeah back then wasn't as educated, so that you know. I still think about like there's a picture she's to have receptors on these this will. kind of was who.

14460.0,Patient,"grow well as men my term that's also another thing that's really corpus Wednesday. for something that I did not do, I was a my name is summer in May. And rented a car, obviously I was a mining and one of my friends was supposed to return the car, because my phone was at 530 in her flight was later that day so she agreed to turn the one acquire. All the way to her turning the other party, and she gets into an accident, she calls me as we're on the worldly like literally taken office she's like I got into an accident, but the phone is broken up and i'm like What do you mean you as an accident. texture like whatever you do turn the keys and take a car and the keys in my way we do, because it shows on the car right So if you, if I get to an accident okay that's fine as long as you turn acquiring. are going to work with me and you know cake. yummy in Stage she says that. She said that the rental car company or the total over she never at the cartoon she was a part of gas station. She says that the tow company was telling her to call the rental company we get the car car towed right which is weird to me on my while they told you that you need to call the company to get clarity. On the finance obviously because she didn't want to pay the car rental fee, and so, she said she also submitted with the other party's accident right. she gave them my information, instead of her so. When they move on to the accident name change information she gave them my ID right instead of her making a police report because she told me that it was their fault. Instead of her making a police report she did not so the other people made a police report, and I have a ticket in my name and my license is. suspended, and I also have a cease and desist because I didn't know that the car company was the President of content company to get the $7,552 and 64 cents for my account, I did not have $7,552. When I read like when I finally get touch with the car company on there, like you, didn't turn the car he didn't tell me, she didn't turn the car she said. I should turn the car in like she didn't put a pull it into the law, she say she pulled him around a lot. The car company was like you said you left it on at alive were really truly, we have to track the GPS in the car and find a gas station is there. And she was like and then by they really read me to feel them was like you didn't you didn't even turn the keys and have somebody else tell the keys, in which. She did a turnkey that she had my other side, the keys and have my other for push her back so the moles there is she crashed the car use my information got a ticket ticket in my name for the incident that she goes. she's on a plane, the next day. And the power company charges $5,000 instead of thousand dollars so i'm suing her for all our money back, but the word. For $7,000 a year for 10 hours to try to compromise with her, because I didn't I really didn't know that the car company will take the money out of mark. I can, I read the contract and the contract it's a dummy breach that reach the contract by not turning the part in. So when she turned the corner in I wouldn't I wouldn't have to charge me wouldn't want to do my insurance versus we get a charge out of pocket. So when I asked her I didn't even know she gave them my idea either so i'm like you gave when I read the email from the parent company they told me this, and so, when i'm ready, I sent it around like. You gave them i'd like to die finishes I guess i'm like my game, as they think I will drive in and she's like yes like what have. You done."

Like the nerves is so shot why. I just a token every time i've never been to Georgia, something like that idea like super super super nervous. Other shaken shortness of breath and all anxiety. And he also makes me angry, because I thought we were friends over literally we were friends friends, we went to Miami everything was great the whole Miami was great until she got up until she got to that car garage. And I also tried that compromise their head before I even."
759.0,Provider,took so.
14460.0,Patient,"Long to. yeah I literally was like we could do payment plans, I even like could we had our read only have like 25 of my account. And so. They basically had a replay 25 plus then negative account balance, I was in my account. So my walk. I was going to take full I wasn't I wasn't authorized user. You know. i'll just go ahead and take that 25 you get paid and negative balance in my account, which was 5000. And something. she's like oh no I feel like everybody else should have paid so ad for other friends with us as well, so she felt like everybody else should have paid as well as her."
759.0,Provider,"Know dive into the accident, she didn't make sure that the car was turned in that was fairly responsibility."
14460.0,Patient,"Exactly so she didn't want to cover my dad i'm like well, you have car insurance, you can go to your car insurance and they said they will refund you the money. And everything will be good, and she was like I don't have car insurance, but she lived. and come to find out she had got into an accident like the day before I found out about everything, which was a whole month later, so by then my license is suspended in Florida, but I didn't even know I had a ticket. or none of the like I didn't know until I got into you know touch with the car company and so. I went to her house, because she wasn't texting back in a respectful manner, considering, I have a son and my whole entire account is in a negative. $5,000 in this is your fault. or go to her house so she has a mom come outside like first of all how old, are you. We are grown. You came out here as well, to me like an adult you had your mom come on site it's not like I was like trying to fighter. I was just trying to get down to the game now So what are we going to do, and still have mom goes, I feel like there's three people are founders you the car company in jalen and i'm like why. Are you serious like you're really gonna sit here and say everybody else's at all, except for already took my fault and said that I would have left it alone with the 25 of my kindness she couldn't pay my negative values which are still don't want to do that. The $5,000 i've already paid half of the half of it, you have to be. Right, because you had an accident, no i'm like well y'all can use all your shirts the moms and spoons i'm like yours like. ain't like her daughter has a you have a car, I know you have insurance on million I run around dirty a because I know. I know you I know you're not around during the other shows a boat sit there and live my faith, I know you don't have insurance and. I feel like it's everybody's fault, because you're all rented the car everybody hand was not on the wheel, not everybody had been on the wheel terminated and okay miss anybody fault, but she didn't want to compromise, she. I text her like a long paragraph ultimatum of our phone and everything and give her one final chance she texts me back a day later on performance on partners is said nothing but. um she feels like she shouldn't have that they have I will she says, I will pay the ticket off with just 190. But i'm not going to traffic school cuz I would have a point on my license for this, because she had that accident that's a good point if you ever go to travel school and be one. That i'll pay the ticket, but I can't do the traffic and i'll pay half of the negative balance, but I feel like everybody should pay the other half so basically she's trying to only pay like. 25 25,000 are you serious, why do you feel like everybody else should pay. yeah that would be super long for me to be like y'all y'all gotta pay for jail is X know that that was the other way around. It would you would be going insane so we have core tomorrow, and I am very, very dangerous enough still like only he is not because of my story in my case, because I feel like I already one. But I don't want her to be like I don't have a month now, she works at united she works, and I know she still works, because she has one of my friends in our close friends on those interventions at work recently doing something. And I feel that she will say I don't have the funds to pay $10,000 by her they do her and her family do but it's all I guess all a matter of like figuring it out if she really has it or not. yeah and I told I. told my lawyer like. we'll just we'll worry about that, when that time comes, on my my anxiety cannot worry about that is going to worry about that, until the time comes, not willing to like."
759.0,Provider,You know everything gets settle in court right.

I hope she does show up to court, because the Lord said he doesn't show up issue another court date and I don't want another coordinate goes. Mind adding even more. Because I just wanted to eat overweight and I. know she does the sneaky stuff like to say you really simple the monitoring really like live with your family like to the lawyer, we get the penis. So the lawyer had to do extra work like the process servers have to actually go to like based on a stalker house until she I told them the time to get up for work and everything because she went over me.

759.0,Provider,"You know, for the."

That type of stuff because it makes me want to beat you. Had a result to be in people, I really do."
759.0,Provider,"yeah so that's a lot yeah just going to court tomorrow have your head held up high and just you know realize dad you're doing it for a purpose you doing it to kind of clearing your name. And what went on, you know and just realize that you're going to your lawyers have been product, and you have been product and and just you know hope for the best outcome right.
