You know, so if it's a typical. assessment which I do often. that's not a problem, because I know what the questions I know what they're asking. But in this case, I do not know and usually.

10850.0,Patient,Right.
214.0,Provider,Like a.
10850.0,Patient,And how do we put it. into care and all that's going to be gone.
214.0,Provider,yeah you can't bank on any free stuff I agree.
10850.0,Patient,"You can't you can't do you have to. And I think this whole. problem we're having. Is people go home back to work, and nobody wants to sit there, I had to be both this virus smooth can't blame for it."
214.0,Provider,"I totally get it as well, I mean I don't know what I don't really know what all the chances are going to be going forward i'll tell you."
10850.0,Patient,A day it's pretty picture.
214.0,Provider,"I would agree. i'm just because you know. I there's just that. The people involved. Like i'm just talking about like the 20s 30s and 40s they are really built very different um. Then, when we were 2030s and 40s very different the belt and. Now i'm responsibility, a non committal show I don't know what the world's really gonna bring us i'll be honest i'm a little concerned um. You know that the days of having people who committed work hard for a good salary, maybe over."
10850.0,Patient,"yeah. No, I mean there's. You don't want to work with you know. I see it."
214.0,Provider,"I get it as well i'm. i'm just i'm just again I don't know I don't know business owners. I guess it's going to be pretty different. to figure out, you know what. What a good employee is I think they're gonna have to go through a lot of. Different employees to figure out what employees, going to be successful, for them."
10850.0,Patient,"yeah. And it's a. know people just aren't committed, yes it. Is your job. You know. someplace else."
214.0,Provider,"yeah I mean the pickens is dead, the problem is there's just um. You know you're not getting your biggest bang, for your buck. You know, and that and that's a shame to. Say but, like you know you, you know I I consult for a couple of companies and we're where we lucked into make any investment in six months, we used to do a 90 day in our we maybe even changing that nine months like we're not looking to do. Any health care we're looking to stay on probation for as long as possible because we're finding that the trend is they don't stay past three and less likely they'll be there in six and then you got to start reinvesting again with training and everything, and so it becomes quite difficult."
10850.0,Patient,yeah.
214.0,Provider,"I so. jake no it's not and here's the problem you know you, you want to. have an investment in someone but they don't want to have an investment in themselves so i'm finding more and more employees being like yeah I just. I don't want to. I want to pay the going rate I don't want to sign a signing bonus I want them going through a couple of hoops. And then we'll figure out, you know how we're going to address this, so it looks like we're together again on September 13 at eight o'clock I mean five o'clock your time eight o'clock my time which is fine. um it looks like you haven't done you September surveys yet."
10850.0,Patient,"So yeah if you get a chance, I would appreciate that."
214.0,Provider,"And it looks like. The August drug screen wasn't done either so if we can get a September, one that would be perfect."
10850.0,Patient,yeah I just one just came in the mail this week.
214.0,Provider,fabulous look at that. fabulous okay so i'm gonna see you on the third thing is I don't run that group anymore and i'll wait for an email from you i'm further information on how I can help you with the sleeve OK.
