12186.0,Patient,Eastern Carolina Eastern Carolina university. Chapel hill wake forest University of Vermont New York medical college Albany medical college University of Connecticut University of buffalo.
528.0,Provider,Just found.
12186.0,Patient,Everywhere yeah.
528.0,Provider,wow oh my gosh.
12186.0,Patient,And they all have like five essays each so i'm like.
528.0,Provider,holy cow that sounds like what.
12186.0,Patient,"yeah it's Okay, though. Not doing that much else, right now, so."
528.0,Provider,"yeah um. But sounds like all east coast. Well, how was your how's everything else, anything that you want to report on."
12186.0,Patient,"I went to the allergy doctor today, but they never told me that I was supposed to start my like taking my anti histamine like a week in advance. So we did the scratch test and they came back after 15 minutes and they're like yeah even the control is in showing up for you did you stop taking your anti histamine and i'm like oh I don't know, I was supposed to get like logically, it makes sense. yeah they were supposed to tell me that, but they never did. But they sent me to get like certain allergens for. A blood test and then they'll call me back to scratch test again, but I kind of want to call them back tomorrow and be like it's not my fault that I didn't know I wasn't supposed to stop So can I just come back in a week after not taking anti. histamines yes i'm going to inquire about that because I don't really get it and also she said that she thought it probably wasn't a food allergy, because if I had an allergic reaction to food, it probably would have showed up right away, not like overnight. It could have been something viral but she was going to test me for like environmental allergens and stuff anyway, because I take claritin all year."
528.0,Provider,Like.
12186.0,Patient,"that's not normal I just always have really bad seasonal allergies anyway so she was going to ask me for that, but um. yeah she said with food intolerances and stuff like that, like. it's a lot of trial and error it's like you eat something you don't feel good and then you stay away from it, because there's no good way to test for that yeah hardcore allergies, so I probably will never have an answer as to what that. issue was, I mean it was so bad I showed her and she's like oh my gosh what the heck."
528.0,Provider,"that's crazy. um well, I guess, if it happens again, I mean."
12186.0,Patient,"I know. it's weird because i've never had a reaction to. Anything in my life like that, before so. that's why I was freaked out, and I was like I need to go and see what the heck is going on, because nothing like that had never happened to me. yeah and, like my dad's allergic to like octopus and squid. Like really allergic so I was like Oh, maybe i'm allergic to something to like I better check just to make sure. you're wrong thing and then go into like anaphylaxis or something but. yeah i'm okay."
528.0,Provider,"Okay okay. And, did you. Did you try the gluten bread."
12186.0,Patient,yeah. i'm getting blood work done so on the eat in like a lot of gluten before and then test to see celiac because. that'll be like definitive I guess.
528.0,Provider,So you're going to get a test for for celiac because what you said.
12186.0,Patient,yeah what i'm actively eating gluten.
528.0,Provider,Okay.
12186.0,Patient,I think that's a good i've had. i've had them in the past and I wasn't eating gluten when I had so like some kind of show up. yeah so um we're going to do a test that way she also like spectrum of intolerances and sensitivities so.
528.0,Provider,"Okay um. yeah because I was actually gonna. I wanted to talk to you, I was going to email you this week about because I was like looking into what you're telling. me as far as."
12186.0,Patient,You know the whole gluten issue.
528.0,Provider,"And the iron and it. So it looks like pretty much what I could find is that, and you may already know this, but basically like the only time that iron can become deficient or I guess the relationship between like iron deficiency and gluten. is like. With. celiac disease so. Once. A once this once the stomach is healed or the. intestine is healed. Then. The iron deficiency like that it's easier for the body to absorb iron and so. I was that was my that was I was thinking i'm like maybe you have celiac disease, maybe that's the reason that you weren't absorbing iron because of that fact versus like you were saying that like it got better right like even. Even without the even with the transfusions it didn't get better right and like nothing was really helping until you avoided gluten right. yeah so I don't know that's what made me think i'm like."
12186.0,Patient,"that's what we were doing, but every time that i've been tested. For celiac disease I eating gluten at the time, so."
528.0,Provider,"Okay, oh I didn't realize you had been tested before okay yeah I have but I wasn't eating gluten so it came back negative yeah. gotcha okay."
12186.0,Patient,So. But I guess we'll see now because i'm going to like they just eat gluten. And gluten just to see what happens so. it'll be good to just know. um yeah.
528.0,Provider,mm hmm. Anything else you are working on this week.

Oh, the other day, my mom. grill cod like oil and all these spices and I just sitting there thinking about it i'm like wow like three months ago, I would have freaked out eating this because it's like put a little bit too much salt in it, and like obviously it was like marinated in oil and. i'm like this is probably one of the best things that you've made such a long time, like a taste said. And it was just Nice."
528.0,Provider,that's awesome yeah we haven't talked too much about your sodium I remember you mentioning that.
12186.0,Patient,yeah but now it's not even an issue I don't.
528.0,Provider,"Okay, you don't even think about it."
12186.0,Patient,"No, I don't know it's awesome. yeah it's much better, so now, when I have something and it doesn't have enough salt and like I need to add salt to this. yeah so long, I was so worried, it would make me I was like oh it's gonna blow me if I put salt like it's. Like no, you need salt. lake so it sit there my classes and we'd be learning about how you need sodium in your body."

528.0,Provider,Because i've seen you use that a lot too.
12186.0,Patient,"Oh yeah I just I put it in like smoothies and yogurt just because, like. I don't know we did on a debate about whether or not college and actually works and one of my nutrition classes and I was. Inside so i'm like biased towards it, but."

12186.0,Patient,"Oh, we did a debate in one of my courses about like whether or not collagen supplements actually work or not. And I was like totally like I chose a pro college and inside because i'm so by toward six i've been taking them for so long, I mean I think my nails grow really fast, even when I had an eating disorder, like my nails would grow like. week so. that's not an exaggeration."
528.0,Provider,crazy okay it works.

12186.0,Patient,"Like I found these. And I was doing that a lot this week. I didn't plan it ahead of time, but I found frozen peaches like an actual peach that was in his prime rightness but I didn't like we bought like a whole pack, and I was like I can't eat all these when they were like this right, so I froze them all. And I found them in the bottom and my freezer and I was like oh my gosh this is amazing, so I just thought now and they tasted just like a normal like."

12186.0,Patient,"I was eating peaches all week, I was like this isn't. My page season anymore yeah."
528.0,Provider,"So yes, you were so tell me about like the process or just explained to me like how you went how you decided what to eat, for your snacks."
12186.0,Patient,"or whatever I decide what to eat for a snack I like I genuinely stop, and I say what am I in the mood for. What really would sound good to me, or like oh look in the fridge or say like Oh, do I have. This way that and then I also kind of consideration like what else i've had that day like how long ago ID and and then, if I know I mean our in our. Better even smaller or like yay there was one day that I got my nails done so I packed something like a little film that kind of thing that I like to go. Which i'm glad I just ate it in between get manicure pedicure. um but so it's kind of just taking into consideration the situation my hunger logo and meeting next. Okay yeah."
528.0,Provider,"That sounds. And, have you found that for the most part you're satisfied with what. You choose or have there been times. Where it was like that off the mark, or you know something like that."
12186.0,Patient,"What i'm most part i'm satisfied. yeah I would say, for the most part, you know i'm sometime my God I wish I would have had this instead but I don't beat myself up about it i'm getting a lot better about life I don't really like something it's like fine like it's like. I don't like it. that's okay just still eat it like I got that it was so funny I was in my therapy session. And I was drinking a complete like the new fall kombucha. it's like it's weird it's apple turmeric and like spices. And I was like Oh, people said, this is good in the first SIP I look I don't like this. But I was like but i'm still going to drink it because you don't have to love everything you eat. But then, as I drink more and more, I was like no I actually love this and Catherine has like. We went from I don't like it too it's okay to this is amazing throw this session. is funny. But i'm getting a lot better by like if I don't love something like it's still okay it's not a weight."
528.0,Provider,"Right okay you're getting back in okay that's um it sounds like you're using a little bit more like compassion, or like kindness around it like it's not like."

528.0,Provider,back when I was just gonna say taking out the perfectionism and you're eating.
12186.0,Patient,yeah.
528.0,Provider,"um Okay, and so, for the most part you've been satisfied there's sometimes where you choose something and you're like and like it's not great, but you just keep going like you keep."
12186.0,Patient,"yeah yeah Oh, this is random but i'm thinking now because i'm thinking about this, they have like a pre made pumpkin bread there. I think that would be like a challenge just for me to get like a pre made baked dessert. Like because could make my own pumpkin bread. or one of their you know."
528.0,Provider,yeah are you talking about at trader joe's.
12186.0,Patient,"yeah they have like I saw pumpkin bread there and I almost bought it like I know you can just make your own pumpkin bread, but it's like why I think the trader joe's this weekend i'm going to get that."
528.0,Provider,"that's a great one I love that yeah because you only challenged if I remember correctly, I think you did the like donut or muffin or something like one big screen. Yes, it's good that you did."
12186.0,Patient,What they were like a few. I went to like a an actual bakery. and got something. So I think that'll be good to challenge that against them done while.
528.0,Provider,"For sure, and especially if that's something that looks good to you."
12186.0,Patient,"yeah Either that, or I could go to an actual because there's this one bakery that I follow, and they have, like all these. yummy looking. Like. pumpkin update treats. I think it would be good to try and do that again."
528.0,Provider,yeah I.
12186.0,Patient,"agree that's that service. um I also want I just try this week, but I kind of want to do. Like just challenge it again."

A baked potato or something instead, and that would be fine. Okay, I know, like I think that's something that I need to like plan to challenging."
528.0,Provider,"that's a good one. I mean. yeah it seems like certain some of them are just easier for you than others, but the more you like challenge it the easier it'll it'll become right."

528.0,Provider,mm hmm. yeah it's all these little things that kind of add up right like.
12186.0,Patient,These little.

I got like a bowl of something or like you know different like a me and a vegetable and car I don't like I just like having more of a like a structured meal, I guess, then, like the sandwich. I don't think that would fill me up either, but if we can test. For eating behaviors when she works she'll like not eat all day she'll eat like a bowl of cheerios in the morning and then like not eat all day and then she'll calm and eggs or like pancakes or like half a box of cheez its or something. So my most of my dad whatever he wants he's like you, wave and foot. He worked all day, so he doesn't have time to like cook. yeah."

528.0,Provider,"Maybe it's just you're having a bad day like not use Internet may have had. Are. So for meals and stuff. It looks like you're still kind of. hungry, you know you're following the meal plan it looks like you know. Which is good, I I kind of want you to still keep doing that. But, are you kind of. I mean, are you using some intuitive eating and terms."
12186.0,Patient,I would say um I would say the things that I crave it's like i'm not trying to say like this and it's like oh okay this Saturday what i'm crazy spirit thinning all the exchanges that's good. yeah it's kind of like. When i'm making meals.
528.0,Provider,You know it's kind of like.
12186.0,Patient,it's kind of like i'm intuitively using changes.
528.0,Provider,yeah like your body just met it aligns with the. meal plan like it just naturally wines yeah yeah.
12186.0,Patient,"If i'm like thinking of what to make for dinner and there's not enough like. This something. like this is missing, something and then i'll add like some source of that on it and we go there you go."
528.0,Provider,And I mean How often do you kind of check in with your satisfaction in terms of.
12186.0,Patient,A lot lately.
528.0,Provider,Oh yeah.
12186.0,Patient,"yeah i've been really making a point to actually like pay attention to what i'm tasting. Okay, like. How I feel after eating a meal like did I actually like that oh yeah I did like and sometimes actually like. make a note of, like you, like like i'll make like a note in my notes folder on my say like. i'll put whatever it wasn't like this, like that, whenever I don't know what to eat go back and look at me like oh yeah that was that was awesome."
528.0,Provider,"So yeah absolutely. yeah um. i'm looking at your notes here. So okay so you're and like are you are, you are you getting hungry for each meal."
12186.0,Patient,"Like putting for the most part yeah sometimes your snacks i'm not super hungry yet, but they're starting and i'll be okay no like. Now it's starting to kick in a little bit. yeah for the most part, like for meals yeah I get hungry."
528.0,Provider,"Okay okay good and then, how are you deciding when to stop eating do you. eat everything you know I eat."
12186.0,Patient,On my plate.
528.0,Provider,yeah okay.
12186.0,Patient,"Usually my meals I don't feel the need to get this, but sometimes for snacks i'll go back and get some more."
528.0,Provider,"Okay, good."
12186.0,Patient,"Have like crackers or something i'll get more crackers or, if I have like i'm like a lot of times i'll go back and get like an extra granola or something like that Colonel, let me just a little bit more on this little bit of yogurt i've loved."
528.0,Provider,"yeah as I think that's a big thing for me too it's like yeah you went back for more because yeah sure yeah you're really listening to. Your fullness your satisfaction and you're like giving yourself permission to get more food, if you need it."
12186.0,Patient,mm hmm.
528.0,Provider,"yeah that's that's amazing um so it sounds like you're I mean it sounds like you're really moving more towards like intuitive eating, but it happens to kind of align with the meal plan, which is to be honest with you is is is like kind of the way it usually works for most people. You know, is like. That structured meal plan is kind of what normal like a normal way of eating looks like so you kind of been retraining yourself all this time."
12186.0,Patient,"yeah I i'm telling my parents this, the other day and i'm like yeah we kind of moved away from like planning snacks so much. yeah and i'm finding that i'm sleep like pretty much the same thing you know i'm not like thinking in events like, how can I fit this exchange and this is Jay welcome back on my log i'm like oh no it's the same. doing it, but it's good. yeah meeting other normal."
528.0,Provider,"Absolutely, and how are you feeling like physically like. amazing you're feeling good."
12186.0,Patient,"I was told catherine's the other day, but I was just like in a shower one day and I was like I love my body just sat you know, I was like I didn't expect. That to me is happy and like obviously some wake up in the morning, like. feeling super puffy or something which is normal and i'll feel like oh i'm not feeling my best today but i'm kind of giving myself grace with that and saying like, but everyone has these days it's not just you it's not like you look entirely different like you. you're confident, I saw my mom is in the karmic i'm so much more confident in how I look now, and I feel great and i'm just overall happy so. My floating has been so much better it's like my stomach doesn't look like i'm pregnant anymore after I eat it's like. my stomach looks like a normal person stomach would look after they eat a meal like."
528.0,Provider,"So, are you only taking the probiotic or are you taking something else."
12186.0,Patient,I take the trento.
528.0,Provider,Oh good I.
12186.0,Patient,only do it once a day now.
528.0,Provider,Okay.
12186.0,Patient,"I used to take it before every meal, but then I. Like I was reading about like how other people kind of went through taking it so what they would do is they'd like, for the first two weeks or so, they would take it before every meal and then they would go to like just once a day. And i've started doing the, just like in the morning, I take. It and yeah seems doing good things for our body haze."
528.0,Provider,"So less bloating and then your bowel movements, how are they doing."
12186.0,Patient,A lot more regular. I think that's a product of the mirror lacks to though because i'm.

12186.0,Patient,"Ever she literally told me she's like I will send this and I said, are OK. And then I was like whatever so I just send it to you. So i'll just keep on doing that because they tend to do the after visit summaries, so I think that's easy to think that way I don't have to like worry about having my phone like hold on I don't want to hold my phone on the scale, because that would probably add like half a pound or. Something so. But i'll just take like screenshots of the after visit summary and just send them to you after."
528.0,Provider,"yeah no best way to do it. works totally, and I mean does you know just just curious, but the thing that number trigger you are anyway, or do you feel happy about it, you feel like what's your."
12186.0,Patient,"doesn't trigger me, which is surprising that's. that's awesome I i've. heard this too and i'm like I don't ask from the number and i'm more detached to how I feel and how look like hey that's a number. You look great you feel a. The numbers. Because the number is also dependent on so much more it's just dependent on so much now."
528.0,Provider,"Oh, my God yeah it doesn't mean anything about. Your health or you know you're."
12186.0,Patient,"Right now, I think my numbers like I don't mind, seeing it, but I think once i'm past these like major stages of recovery and i'm more like okay now just like stay stable like you can just like chill a little bit.

I think, because you're eating intuitively and listening to your body and feeling good and all that, like. Your body is just going to be where it's going to be at this point, you know what I mean, so I don't think we're as focused on like weight restoration per se, as we are, as I mean your weight might still go out like i'm not saying that that's but that's."
