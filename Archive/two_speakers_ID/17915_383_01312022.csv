17915.0,Patient,"hi. I always get stuck in those. Like which link to select on and which link to click on so i'm always like wondering which one to click on, and then I go on one, and then it takes forever and i'm like oh. So."

17915.0,Patient,"Okay, great."
383.0,Provider,yeah So how are you doing today.
17915.0,Patient,"i'm feeling, you know i'm feeling okay on my i've been having some you know trouble sleeping. Well, tend to like you know i'll fall asleep party like 1011 and then I wake up like around sometimes within three or four o'clock and. You know just tend to like to Scott asleep, I mean it takes me a while to go back to sleep but um you know I think I was experiencing some kind of like anxiety. Where I was just get this sudden like rush of anxiety where it will it was just troubled me, and of course it wouldn't let me want to go back to sleep so um but you know, and then I try to find time during the day after i'm done with my classes on school and like. You know, to take a nap and I usually do. So. But other than that you know i've been on you know I i've been taking more walks i've been going to a meetings. And more like. You know I try to go, like the last what couple weeks so um so they they've been you know they've been helping me to really focus on my recovery and and. You know just just being able to connect with with other addicts and people and to get to hear their story, because I get tired of hearing my own, but. You know i've been i've been doing Okay, you know. I mean the times I get triggered to want to go during but it's only because it's just I don't want I don't want to you know I don't want to stop I want to stop thinking about just being worried about you know everything that's going on, so. But school keeps me busy school. You know it it's it's an outlet for me that I enjoy you know that's not easy for me, because you know it's. there's a lot of reading a lot of writing and comprehension and I struggle with that because I haven't learned disability. And you know I wanted to talk to Escobar about that, today, about. The fact that because I have a learning disability that I might have some ADHD symptoms. Where i'd have trouble focusing have trouble. You know accomplishing my task times being on time I tend to feel hypersensitive about. about things. And I tend to burst out in anger, but not in a. In a violent way just I tend to kind of just you know my yell or I tend to kind of just you know. get a guy did aggravated and upset and close myself off. Other than that, you know i've been okay i've been good."
383.0,Provider,"Okay, good good um it seems like you're doing a lot to help yourself. Yes, and that's really great. You know, going to meetings walking being involved in school you're seems like you're pretty busy. that's good."
17915.0,Patient,"yeah I mean I try to tend to feel like. Am I busy enough, you know, like what my time. School does does keep me busy, and at times it, it gives me an opportunity to like you know. To find time to go and study you know, wherever I need to go to to keep that you know that that space that I need to study to clear my mind and. You know, try to understand. You know the purpose of the subject and the and the information, so you know it takes me time to really like grasp of what i'm reading depending on you know the grade level and. You know terminology that's that's been used, so it can be pretty tough, at times, you know and and I feel sometimes overwhelmed by it, so I think that the anxiety, at times, tends to get triggered by that."
383.0,Provider,mm hmm.
17915.0,Patient,"And you know, of course, and i'm still i'm still great i'm still grieving over my sister's passing you know and. i'm just feeling that times you know I feel at times angry, I feel at times too sad, you know because I truly I truly you know. Love there and care for her and adored her and appreciated another time that that I had with her, even though she was sick, you know, and she suffered a lot from alcohol and. Now just deteriorated so that's one thing that I always keep in mind about if I go back to relapse in and going back to that. That old that old way of living, you know, because you know I don't want to die, I want to, I want to live my life to the best of my ability, with everything that i've done and. Everything that i'm trying to do i'm trying to make an effort for myself and it's not easy but, but I do feel better at this at the end of the day, where I feel like I accomplished something. And I think that's where i'm at in my life, where I feel like I I need to rebuild my identity, you know, because there are times and i'll go and my girlfriend will go to a movie theater will go out to eat or go to you know there's a line or will go. To like you know personal and and I try to enjoy myself when i'm around my friends or family, but there are times when. When I feel really down, and I feel like you know I don't deserve to feel this way you know I don't deserve to to to feel good about myself like like I feel like i'm stuck in this like not being able to enjoy the moment so i'm in. And I I i'm starting to feel like it's a numbing process for me and that nami process if your soul familiar because of the the local hope you saw i've done to myself and everything so. You know, those are things that I had to really consider those are things that I had to really. You know, ask myself, like what, what can I do about that, how can I, how can I look at things in a brighter perspective when everything seems dark you know. And again, it goes back to that that emotional. You know connect of behaviors that you've been talking about well i've been looking at that more often, you know, trying to identify which one. i'm know which ones, I feel that I that I struggle with, and it seems like you know a lot of them I can relate to a lot of them that i've been dealing with since I was a child. So I think the trauma that i've been dealing with with the with the ptsd has been not just with the recent accident that happened, but also with my sister's death. And you know as a child has been exposed to. To you know things that that just. It kind of just you know I always felt like I said never. never really was given the opportunity to. You know, like. My I mean I know my parents are proud of me, and they want what's best for him and they're happy that i'm. You know, attempting and going back to school and they give me that support and I love it, but the thing is is you know growing up my dad used to you know verbally abused me used to call me names he's too, you know, and he was an alcoholic himself, you know, but I don't blame them, you know. And um you know I mean I can't really go back to how the the whole ptsd started, you know I never thought that I would ever experienced something like that. Because I always thought that ptsd is for people that are in the marines or in the military, you know, I have some friends and family that that have come from that background and they've experienced that."
383.0,Provider,"Well there's there's different different forms of trauma it's not so you know you might actually have. You know related traumatic stress disorder diagnosis that's kind of more maybe complex trauma and not not the post traumatic stress disorder that you know some coming back from military has so there's different kinds of trauma and. And yet, people still do have trauma related to chronic stress or or. A specific stress or that's been very difficult to cope with. yeah, but I think that. You know you're in this sort of in between place of not knowing the outcome of I mean that's contributing to your anxiety right. and middle of the night of like what's going to be the outcome. Of this event that happened this accident."
17915.0,Patient,"yeah I mean it's always of course and running into my head and you know it's just Sometimes I feel like there's nothing I can do about it, but all I can do is just focus on what i'm doing now, which is seeking treatment and. You know, going to school and trying to. Try to look at it in a positive light, like you know. And sometimes it's hard for me to really look at it like that, because. You know, it was just you know it happened so fast and that happens so just drastically, where I felt like it was a tragedy, but you know i'm. glad that the person that I hit didn't die or didn't suffer any major major you know injuries that that that I could have that could have prevented him from walking or. From you know. That, and I feel guilty about that I feel really like. Like what kind of person does that, but the thing is is right."
383.0,Provider,person does what.
17915.0,Patient,"What kind of person does that to didn't mean on you, you get it, I understand accidents happen, you know I mean they happen that they're not things that you can prevent. But I feel like you know. What person wouldn't leave somebody leaving their them nine underground injured, you know and that's what happened. I felt like I feel responsible for that I feel like that is something that that I that I should have not had done, I should have just. You know, made every attempt to to get out of the car and make sure he was Okay, even though I know he wasn't so, but the trauma that happened when he hit my windshield it it really drastically affected my outlook and how I respond to. The trauma that the the intensity of it, you know, like. never got to experience that and I think that's what caused me to panic."
383.0,Provider,yeah.
17915.0,Patient,"You know, and I don't really like talking about it, but then again, you know it's just it's just you know it's just an experience that I went through. it's just I can't really say much detail about it, because you know my attorney and everything, so I can't really. get into detail, maybe one day I will when everything's all said and done, but right now, I have to be confidential and that's something I respect. You know from from people that do you know that that offer that confidentiality and want to make sure, like you know that i'm i'm protected and i'm you know and and there's reasons behind that so I you know, I understand that. yeah to be cautious, of what I say what I do you know."
383.0,Provider,"But one thing I do want to clarify, is that the. Is that you, this is a confidential space I. it's it's the most one of the most confidential. Professional spaces, that you could be in. So, and I, and I also want to really respect your your. need to keep to not speak about things you don't feel comfortable speaking about, as well as. give you the feedback that this is a. This is a confidential conversation that we're having. With with some exceptions, of course, you know, there are exceptions, if you have you know i'm bound by law to report if you have any to keep you or someone else safe i'm bound by law to have to report that."
17915.0,Patient,"yeah no I understand those things and then those things, I know that they come for a reason you know because you're. you're if you're in a position to wanted to hurt yourself or finish suicide or or there's any kind of verbal abuse and it kind of like yeah I get that you know, but not that that's not a problem here, you know i've never really had, though."
383.0,Provider,"I just want to make that clear to you that you actually. do have a confidential space, maybe, if you want to talk about your feelings about it or any details that it's pretty safe space, I just want to reaffirm that."
17915.0,Patient,"yeah no yeah no I I understand there's a confidentiality between patient and client and but The thing is, is like. there's only certain things, I can say, and I can do so, you know, like if I want to talk about how the accident affected me. i'm fine with that you know I just and that's what you were just doing you were just talking about that. there's always like somebody listening and or somebody that can get that information, you know, like. it's because you know it's, not that I don't trust you I do you know I not want to establish that trust with you because you're my therapists and I want to be able to. break new ground with you because I want to be I don't want to share this with no more, I want to, I want to feel happy, I want to feel content with myself be proud of myself instead of feeling guilty about things."
383.0,Provider,Okay okay.
17915.0,Patient,way that I feel guilty it's because I have sympathy so.
383.0,Provider,"that's not that's not. that's not a pathological. guilt that you're having the guilt that you're having there's there's guilt, that we can consider to be in a way, healthy guilt. guilt that that make you know it's understandable and I think that what that you're experiencing some of that it's not related to ufology that you're you know you're feeling and in a way, like a normal. range of feelings of regret that that you wish, you would have done something different in that situation."
17915.0,Patient,"yeah and The thing is, I want to be able to like forgive myself, for you know, and I try to find ways to do that and it's just I understand people have different ways of how they cope, and how they deal with but it's like. You know I just never been involved in something like this and it in it it's just. When I think about it, and I, you know. I feel like very like frame I feel like I mean. it's just I just never thought and at any moment, I thought that this would not happen to me, but it did, and you know um. But I you know i'm grateful that i'm here, and I can, and I can start over you know with my with my recovery which I did you know and and I needed I need you know I need to be able to have outlets, to be able to talk about how I feel, instead of just bothering me then you know cuz. I mean it's obvious sometimes when I talk about something people know that there's something on my mind, or if i'm too quiet. You know, or if i'm not being expressive people wonder like hey are you okay. yeah i'm okay I just. Just feeling a certain way, you know. And they know they know that you know i'm not taking this lightly there they know that what i'm facing a serious but. they're like Michael try to relax dude like relax like it's going to be okay, you know it's gonna be fine like. To trust that you know. Like it's like it's like you're not like I mean I don't know, I guess, for me, I just feel like. I want to be able to. move past this move beyond this, and be cautious about it, because you know driving is one thing you know driving is a privilege driving is something that you know it's important to take to take control to take you know, like. you're responsible for it, and I take responsibility for it, for what I did. And you know I own up to it. But the thing is is I don't want to be feeling like this, all the time, I want to be. You know I want to be set free from feeling. Like like i'm a bad person."
383.0,Provider,mm hmm.
17915.0,Patient,"You know I mean, I know I have good intentions, I know my hardest is. Is when it's when it's when it's in a good. When my heart is in a good position to be able to love people to serve people to help people. that's when my true intentions come out. You know. I can't force myself to do something I don't want to do. Like there has to come from from within, you know my passion. and You know I i've talked about so many therapists throughout the years and so many diagnosis has been done, I mean by polarization. manic mood disorders, whatever and i'm like you know I don't want to be classified to be something else. Because it doesn't matter to me because all my life that I live with this learning disability and i've learned to manage it i've done to cope with it i've learned to deal with it on my own. But I don't want to help I don't want to like I shouldn't have to do this on my own. I should, I should be able to get the help that I need you know, like. And, and what what ADHD I feel like I do. suffer from some kind of you know symptoms from it, you know i've been doing a lot of research i've been talking to my doctor about it, and he was like yeah I agree, I think you need to talk to Escobar and or you and see if there's something we can you know we can do about that."
383.0,Provider,"yeah if you're looking for you know. That to be addressed, for medication standpoint, she wouldn't be the one to talk to about it."
17915.0,Patient,"When i'm just expressing it to you because you're my therapist. yeah you know because. That is something that that I find very personal to me, you know. And that's something like you know I know that that's who I would have to have that conversation with him that's that and I will I just. I just want to know what i've been thinking."
383.0,Provider,Okay um Have you ever had a diagnosis of ADHD. No or add.
17915.0,Patient,"No, the only diagnosis, I had was when I was a little kid and that was when. You know I would have I would have. I guess I would have these these moments when I would just break down and cry and throw myself on the floor and and throw tantrums and get easily distracted so. You know i'm. The only documentation, I think I can ever get, for it was contacting my contact in my lap my my high school and there might have like an IEP plan or IP assessment, where it shows this is what Michael was. Dealing with you know."
383.0,Provider,Right yeah.
17915.0,Patient,"So i'm in the process of doing that, just so I can have that you know, on file because I want to be able to have everything that I need you know. When I when when I need to show that kind of proof, or when I need to show that kind of documentation to show people like hey, this is what I have."
383.0,Provider,"Well let's let's take a look at I guess encourage you to meet up with chantel about that if you want to address that from a medication standpoint. And and and she would also be the one to you know. To look at the diagnoses and see you know if you meet the criteria and so forth. yeah, so I would like to just shift if you don't mind to looking at the long term goals that we talked about in our last appointment. We have four long term goals for you, but I really like to bring that down and really only focus on to because. I find I think that for is a lot, you know, to look at so let's have these full for maybe you can tell me what your two top ones would be."
17915.0,Patient,Okay.
383.0,Provider,"So, you said you wanted to be able to address how you feel about. Your sister's death. So that was one. i'll read them all to you. You want to be more at ease and not to be so anxious and stressed out and not to worry about things that you can't control that would be the second goal, the third one, is to be able to be more in control of your urges. And then your fourth goal would be to find inner peace with yourself to connect with yourself again to connect with your inner child yeah so those four goals, we can work on all of them later, but what are your top two long term goals of those that I just mentioned."
17915.0,Patient,"Well, I mean, I know, one of them would be to finish finish school, I know that that's a long term goal but."
383.0,Provider,"Before that I mentioned, so we didn't have school on there, these are your mental health balls."
17915.0,Patient,"Oh man, I hope, goes Okay, I thought you talking about like life goes. Well, I know you know want us to be able to talk about my sister and be able to. You know, learn to let go of that of that. Of that you know guilt and and hurt. You know that's something i've been wanting to do it's just I never felt like. Like That was something that. I knew, eventually, I was going to be able to talk about it, but I. I want to be able to."
383.0,Provider,You want to work on is that something you want to work on in therapy right now.
17915.0,Patient,"Yes, yes, yes."
383.0,Provider,"Okay, to work on your feelings about your sister's death. Yes, Okay, and then, which are the other four do you want to take control work on now. So. Not about being anxious controlling your urges and the connecting with your. So."
17915.0,Patient,"yeah being able to control being able to control. yeah being able to control the the the anxiety, you know the the pressure. You know when when to read when to read signs when to read like triggers because I know I can feel it, you know when there's triggers that come up so and those triggers don't use it to make me want to go drink they're just like triggers I make me feel like anxious."
383.0,Provider,OK OK.
17915.0,Patient,"And so, no worries."
383.0,Provider,"Okay, so let's focus on those two first two and we'll table the other two for later. Okay, and let's think about some short term goals with relation to your your sister and deal and the feelings that you have about that. But. What do you think are some short term goals, we can. can put or connects or is it you just want to talk about your feelings are related to your sister's death in therapy."
17915.0,Patient,"yeah I want to just be able to talk about like. You know, things that I went through with her, you know. And then, of course, the last two weeks of her life, you know how it affected me and and my family and and you know just I want to be able to like make peace with it and move on, you know and be. be an advocate for her because you know i'm sure there's a lot of people out there, that I like her in the world. And I want to be able to. I guess not redeemed myself, but I want to be able to like help somebody that I couldn't help. And I I know it's not my fault. I know I know what a pause for a moment."
383.0,Provider,"let's just. I, I would like some more details around your sisters. Your sister, what about the story, because I don't really know so do you want to give me a little bit of background about your sister and your relationship with her."
17915.0,Patient,"yeah my sister she was 36 when she passed, she was like the middle child I had four siblings I was the oldest she's like the middle um she was a person that was very i'm very determined very hard working um you know very outspoken. arm and you know she she came from she's very she's very smart beautiful woman, you know she was she was almost done what college she went to cal state northridge But then when she was going there that's when I started seeing the drinking just going out of control and."
383.0,Provider,you're thinking.
17915.0,Patient,Not my drink and nurse.
383.0,Provider,"Oh, I was like my drinking I don't know if I was drinking when she was heavily drinking."
17915.0,Patient,"I don't think so, but. Okay um but she was you know she. She experienced some some trauma in her life, where she was raped. or. She when she got sick she lost so much way I think she was down to 110 pounds. She was fragile."
383.0,Provider,know about who. Who was sexually abused her did you.
17915.0,Patient,"I don't know exactly who they were. Because you know. She she was. I know that she was always you know, trying to find attention you know from guys and the man that she met. But you know there were a couple instances where. You know she was. I don't know there were campuses instances where I had to go pick up at the hospital, where the doctor I mean whether he brought her in from wherever she was at. um and she took dramatize you know when they said that she's claiming that someone molested or someone sexually because there and."
383.0,Provider,She when that happens.
17915.0,Patient,"I think. You know i'm not sure exactly the age, but i'm pretty the show is between maybe when she was like. 30 years old 32 years old. But you know it happened, more than once, but it was with different different guises, she was listed, I know, and then, and whenever I have a suspicion of who that person was that was that I thought my do it, I confronted him. Okay now."
383.0,Provider,He would tell you about.
17915.0,Patient,"never told me she never told me who it was. But I find out, you know I, I would just find out and."
383.0,Provider,How would you how would you find out if she didn't tell you who it was.
17915.0,Patient,"Well, because she told my mother or she told my brother."
383.0,Provider,And then. You get the information from them.
17915.0,Patient,"yeah because the thing is is I there was a point on my. My my relationship with her, where she was just like so much about oh i'm not drinking or i'm not doing this i'm not doing that, so I got so just. make my, then I just stopped believing her you know, and I should have not done that but um when when I found out that she was molested or whatever I told her tell me who it is that did it and and i'll take care of it. I see it, would be like no I don't want you to be going over there and causing any harm I don't want you to hit these guys. I don't want you to get yourself in trouble i'm like I don't care, you know, like they're hurt you, you know I mean and and I won't let me do what I gotta do and she's like no. Let me deal with it and that's I got mad at her about it, you know because I, I felt like as her older brother, you know I should be able to you know, protect her and and you know and. Whatever wanting or whatever I need to do to prove that to do that she never really gave me the okay. And I wish I would have just gone my own way, but there was a reason why."
383.0,Provider,"So you got the information from there, your other brother or your mom and then did you go and get into fights and stuff with."
17915.0,Patient,"No, no, I never did I honestly I never been into I never got into a fistfight like out on the street never. Okay, I mean I i'm trying i'm trying i'm a black belt candidate for us for tanks at all, which is a you know, a ton of stuff karate that I learned I learned for years and for years, when I was younger. So sort of my sister. Well we're all involved in sports we're always like involved in some kind of activity."
383.0,Provider,You. You did confront these people.
17915.0,Patient,"I did I did confront the ones that I had a suspicion that they did, and, of course, you know they felt intimidated by me saying that. No, I didn't do such a thing to your sister and I told them and I warned them and I said look man, if I ever see you around my sister, and she tells me that you did something to her. I just told them like I got my. You know I want. I want just warn them."
383.0,Provider,"Your night right do you think that that caused them to feel like I mean do you feel badly about doing that kind of being threatening regarding that situation, or is there, something that you are feeling kind of regretful of around this sub."
17915.0,Patient,"grid that I never and I regret that I never really pursued it on my own. I will show what have you know. I wish I would have just found that whole was but supposedly you know my sister file a complaint with the COPs. You know, because when when when it comes to domestic abuse, you know I mean they take this seriously, so you know the COPs were involved i'm sure they got their information, but nothing came out of it, at least, that I don't know about, so my sister was very secretive very secretive."
383.0,Provider,mm hmm. So you don't feel conflicted about how you showed up or didn't show up for her or do you feel conflicted that you wish that you had actually maybe. hurt or.
17915.0,Patient,"Put hands on these people want to sell I don't want to hurt anybody, I never want to hurt anybody it's it's. it's not within my nature is. when somebody messes with my family, yes, you know I will do whatever it takes to protect them. You know, but, but when it comes to violence, I mean I. You would have to really, really, really, really, really, really down give me give me like."
383.0,Provider,"Surely write something to me like to really get me like that, but. What is the conflict that you're having about this internally, if you are having any conflict at all out."
17915.0,Patient,conflict that I feel is just that I didn't. I didn't protect my sister.
383.0,Provider,Okay.
17915.0,Patient,"that's the only conflict, I have is why did. Why don't I take it upon my own self to. To do something about her. Even though I was on the right, you know to to want to protect her I think anybody would."
383.0,Provider,Then you just told me before that you you're not a violent person.
17915.0,Patient,"No i'm not The thing is, is, I can be very verbal about how I feel. And I don't need to get physical, but people usually usually, when I say my piece of what I say what I feel people get intimidated. And i'm trying to be like intimidated I just try to be open and honest and how I feel."
383.0,Provider,"Right, but I guess, so what I am experiencing is. you're on the one hand feeling a little bit like remorseful that you didn't take an action on the part of your sister her. Yes, the other part of you is saying. I am really essentially a non violent person I might I might make a verbal threat but i'm i'm essentially Nonviolent. I don't go to that right."
17915.0,Patient,"I don't go to the extreme like wanting to like. You know, gold stock on somebody or school find that person."
383.0,Provider,"Right so but The thing is, is that, on the other hand, you're kind of wishing that you had. So you're you're in a conflict you're an internal conflict because that's not your nature."
17915.0,Patient,yeah exactly.
383.0,Provider,"So, can you accept the kind of nature that you have that you're not. That this is the kind of person that you are, that you aren't going to."
17915.0,Patient,Have conflict is that what you're saying. That I have internal conflicts with how I feel.
383.0,Provider,"that's what i'm hearing, because you said you do."
17915.0,Patient,"The things that I wish I would have done to compare it to the things that I. That I didn't do, but it was only because it it affected me deeply you know. and i'm not trying to say like I I, I want to go out and her people I don't I mean. Yes, it's suck that my sister got through that and a woman should have to go through that. You know, and I wouldn't ever do that, to a woman, I know I wouldn't ever touch her abuser in any way unless she gave me, you know I mean consent to do it, but I mean. i'm not the kind of like person to violate people or common and just make a threat to somebody because i'm in a bad mood know. I usually learned to kind of learn to talk out my issues. Like that's one thing i've been. i've been trained to do is able to."
383.0,Provider,"You know let's just pause here. Because I think that. Building your self esteem around who you really are. is important because someone that doesn't hurt women and doesn't take advantage of them and violate them compared to these other people who violated your your your your sister. You know you, you are essentially a good person if you're not violating other people and so willfully you know and so your choice to not go and hurt those people also is is out of your good nature so i'm just encouraging you to feel good about yourself."
17915.0,Patient,"yeah I do I do feel that's just the way that I was brought up that was the way that I felt that. You know. I guess it's maybe it's within my. You know what then my my religious beliefs to you know. and I don't like to have conflicts with people I don't but if if that person violates me by what they say and what they do and that affects me i'll let them know, but there are times I don't even want to say anything because it's just not worth my energy."
383.0,Provider,"Right. So we're going to need to wrap up but. We didn't get to the what you know I think you're doing well staying busy with regards to the anxiety and so forth um. I think you in terms of a short term goal of processing your feelings about your sister and her life and her also heard death and your relationship is a good thing to do in therapy. And that's what you've identified, it also is what you want to do. Yes, so we'll continue to do that in our next appointment, do you. Are you in an agreement with that. Yes, Okay, and then in terms of not being so anxious and worrying about the things you can't control. And then doing the things that. You can control would like your school. Being staying clean and sober attending all your meetings will put that under your short term goals for how to manage your anxiety because I think that getting all the support that you can. and staying focused on the things that you can control and the things that you are working on. yeah it's a way to manage your anxiety it's not all going to go away because you have this thing that you don't know the outcome of."
17915.0,Patient,"yeah, of course."
383.0,Provider,"So we'll table the other two goals and let's go to make our next appointment. So the 14th. is in two weeks. So, have a new an appointment on the 14th would that work for you."
17915.0,Patient,"Oh yes, that's fine."
383.0,Provider,"Okay um I. Okay i'm good just Just to give you another option if you wanted it, for I have also a 10am appointment, would you rather have an earlier appointment on the 14th. we're."

383.0,Provider,"Okay, good. How often are you attending your a appointment."
17915.0,Patient,"I go I go I try to go three times out of the week. So i'm going to go one today and then. Go on, on Wednesday and then Friday so. I gotta go I try to go like three four times a week without freemium like like it can be, it can be sometimes um. You know just getting there is half the battle so um, but when I get there and i'm just listening to people, it makes me feel. at ease you know, like to hear somebody else talking about their problems and it makes me feel at ease."
383.0,Provider,"that's so good, can you attend any online appointments or do."
17915.0,Patient,"I do, I do I do one on I don't feel like going out. um you know I just got my computer and I just listening, you know.
