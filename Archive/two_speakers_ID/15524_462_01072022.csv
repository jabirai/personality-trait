Then we were doing mediation and I told them that I want to get divorced anymore, and that. You know I Sullivan. I would you know, put the baby up for adoption, if you want to do. He just like. He. was like no kylie it's over we sweetie a divorce like this happened and. You fake bit cheated on me like I have been cheating on him for like a year. Like we have a really like been together it we've been talking about getting divorced for quite like a while, like a year. And then. I kind of just like let off a little one day and. I was just texting him like a party with text messages that. I was like going to kill myself, I was like I don't want to phuket liberty warfare diversity. And I just like lost it I just like had like a like a major episode. of just like completely being out of control and like losing touch with like reality, I was just a mess. And it was really for like. A couple hours and then, finally, like. I. realized that I was just like why I just sail those things to him. I don't understand why just to that Rachel I don't know what's going on, like. what's wrong with me and then I just you know I just started my arms betrayed tell me for a really long time and he's been trying to tell me for a really long time that I bipolar.

The all of us have jobs that were described that I was reading or things that i've struggled with my whole life. Just like the impulsive behavior. The drug abuse alcoholism, the reckless it does your sexual behavior. All that just really, really had to like fit in, and I really just like thought. This is like I saw it, I was like wow this is, who I am. They never really like. You know, it says that people with borderline personality disorder they don't. They feel like they don't know who they are, you know, like i'm always feeling lost it like something's missing and. And they can never like explain a behavior. Or why did I just do that. I did they just because I wanted to. I never ever really stopped to evaluate or like pause and think about what would have it afterwards, but you know, like, I was just so wrapped up in. Like the moment and how I was feeling. And how extreme my feelings are and I can't like place myself out of this situations because advised by it's like all leaving that I, I can do. Believing that I should do."

And borrowing money from them borrowing money from my dad my mom Does that mean my mom whenever, let me borrow money from her because she knows better than me give me any kind of fucking money. They were I mean it was good until. You know I told them, I was pregnant. Someone else kid and then they were just kind of like whoa what the Fuck the hell is wrong with you. And that they kind of just like. I mean they're like we still love you highly but. We just don't understand what's going on with you. And we don't think that you should. Have we really don't think you should have a child of the child, especially a child that sign your husband's."
462.0,Provider,"Okay, so you do have communication with them, and they have honest communication with you. How about any do you have friends, a friend group with best friend anything like that social support that you contact or get together with."
15524.0,Patient,"Really. My mom. My mom my relationship with my mom it's been really. Hard since I was a child. I think that. I was just a little too off the walls for little to eccentric hello to weird and just different from her like she's like. she's full Japanese and she was raised in a really. Strict Asian environment upbringing everyone out to. You know, do the right thing and go to school and. get married and have children and that stuff and. She was she was pretty quiet issues quite mean to be when I was growing up. She was always putting me down and yelling at me and. She had her mind she thought that putting me down in time yell is never going to do anything was going to motivate me to like. To do better. Right, no. It didn't never really worked for me. I just kind of. Caught more and more sad and would act out a lot. um. Like she would always grown me, and all I wanted to do is like be able to help my friends, because they were always hanging out with their friends and. I was never able to because I was constantly grounded, so I started like escaping my house at night throw a ladder. play second floor house. My mom I mean she would like I lived with her my parents got divorced, when I was 18 they sold our childhood home. My dad wants to go live in moorpark and I slept on his couch for like a year. And then. My mom or she lives, she lives in like apartments for a little while. But she was just like me out Whenever she wanted to she was just be like. hey he needs leave get the Fuck out of here you can't live here anymore, she would make me sleep in the garage where they lived with her like I remember sleeping on her cold garage was like 18 because I was 18 and shouldn't have to. pay for my living anymore, you know. So when I hit 18 I didn't. She didn't have to take care of me anymore basically. She was just kicked me out on a whim Whenever she wanted to, and then i'd be like oh shit I have to go sleep in my car or I have to go. have sex with someone, so I can sleep in their house, you know. Just stuff like that."
462.0,Provider,"So what age, do you think if you could recall you started noticing the borderline personality disorder symptoms."
15524.0,Patient,Until I was like. Maybe 16.
462.0,Provider,"Okay sure. And, have you ever had any formal mental health diagnoses like borderline personality disorder depression, anxiety anything."
15524.0,Patient,"I was diagnosed bipolar. Okay. When I was about 15 or 16 or 17. Okay um I had had an overdose of. Well, at the time I was smoking weed and I was drinking a lot, yes, eating Dax. And I wouldn't my mom and dad put me in rehab. I had overdosed on klonopin and got my stomach pumped. And then. I think it was after I came out of rehab that they died, I went to go see a psychiatrist and he diagnosed as bipolar. And they put me on. Those the mood medication, you know. But I just remember feeling like It made me like so mellow that I never felt happy and I never felt sad."
462.0,Provider,Right.
15524.0,Patient,"And I just couldn't feel anything and I just hate it. Like I feel like I just had no personality at all. That yeah. So I eventually stopped taking it and I told my I told my mom was a mono bipolar you know and for years I was just like this is my problem. i'm an addict. I have depression. anxiety and add and, for me, I was like that's a lot of things to fuckin as already you know. But in like that was with those things in mind, I was really able to just mask. Any feeling that I had something else wrong with me."
462.0,Provider,"Okay, so you feel like you were miss diagnosed and Miss treated with the bipolar as far as like the medication it wasn't working it wasn't helping. And then, have you been treated for like the add and depression and it does that help."
15524.0,Patient,"know even like. The reason why i'm depressed is because I do stupid shit all the time and I hurt people and I don't want to hurt people. But I just can't stop it. Right and like that's that's not going to be fixed by any kind of pill, you know. yeah like it doesn't matter like i've been on a precedence for four years. and i've been on sex, for four years to an extreme degree and this enix is just totally made me zoned out to everything else around me. And i'm taking like three I was prescribed three milligrams a day, which is a lot. For like a year and i'm taking up to like five or six milligrams. You know."
462.0,Provider,"Right so yeah it's a lot of it is behavioral basically as you're saying, and if the PD is up play then that makes sense because the. actions that people with borderline personality disorder typically have are very harmful and hurtful and then cause that repercussion of just feeling really terrible."
15524.0,Patient,yeah and then it just it just ruins my relationships with everyone.
462.0,Provider,"yeah exactly okay. So that makes sense, have you ever had any type of Inpatient mental health treatment."
15524.0,Patient,I went to rehab when I had that overdose on klonopin.
462.0,Provider,"Okay, and what was the result, did you graduate the program was it helpful, did you leave early."
15524.0,Patient,"I had to comply with what they wanted me to do, because I was 17. If I did it they literally told me if you don't do the program if you don't do this you're gonna stay here until you do okay."
462.0,Provider,So you did basically because you were a minor. yeah okay. How about Have you had any other Inpatient treatment or outpatient therapy anything.
15524.0,Patient,"hmm i've done some like drug and alcohol outpatient classes. outpatient therapy, but. i've gotten to a. But. Nothing that I really, really committed to you know."
462.0,Provider,"yeah all right, and then, did you come to bright heart because you wanted medication very people."
15524.0,Patient,"I can honestly first I wanted. To do therapy for like marriage therapy, because when I made this appointment, it was two months ago. And they told me it's going to take two months for you to get you in, and I was like okay fine whatever because I knew that I needed to see a therapist. I think, like a few days after I called. was when I had that episode, I was like i'll Fuck. And I didn't think that. I was going to be able to find that the therapist had any therapist. had experience with borderline personality disorder because, from what i've read. There are a lot of providers that do the therapies for it. Or that have experience with it, or that. are not going to brush it off, and you know, like it's hard to treat only because there aren't enough people that are willing to treat it. So."
462.0,Provider,"We are willing to treat it definitely not brushing it off it's very real and requires treatment so that's good that you did come and it's not marriage therapy, it will be just for you, and then the group therapy as well. Okay, so past history of therapy basically you've had a little bit some some drug and alcohol stuff but never really connected or committed. All right, how about education history, did you finish high school."
15524.0,Patient,"I finished high school I took like a couple classes in college, but I didn't. Finish college."
462.0,Provider,And do you currently work.
15524.0,Patient,"haven't worked, since I lost my job. I was part Oh, I was bartending for the past like five years. And then, when cove it happened. Everything the bars will shut down."
462.0,Provider,"Okay, our finances a source of stress for you."
15524.0,Patient,"Yes, I impulsively spend money, I will spend every last dollar I have in my account negative, I mean I never have money i've never saved money. I can't get a credit card I can't get any car, because I have to credit I can't I have thousands of dollars of debt in PayPal probably. People after me."
462.0,Provider,What do you typically impulsively spend money on.
15524.0,Patient,"Like ship for me and ship for my kids like nothing, though. Like I buy them a lot of frickin clothes online from boutiques it's stupid. And then, like all by myself clothes on line. into stuff like that you know stuff though we don't need."
462.0,Provider,Any medical concerns like Have you had do you have any conditions major surgeries I know you mentioned miscarriages anything else.
15524.0,Patient,"I was born with clubfoot. Then I had a couple surgeries I had one when I was like one and then another one, when I was eight but that's it."
462.0,Provider,And then your current pregnancy are you getting your checkups and everything anything that's sticking out to them.
15524.0,Patient,"um i've been seeing a parent a total just. Because, since the beginning guys like I can't take stop taking my medicine. I have to take xanax I had to take adderall as he may well be true and I don't want to have a baby, the only way that I would have gotten an abortion at that time was if the doctor was like. All those medications are horrible and they're going to cause birth defects and you can't take those medications and be pregnant, but the doctor told me. You can take those medications that he pregnant, because the risk for birth defects are very low. And will monitor your pregnancy and everything turns out everything turned out to be fine. You know. And then I just I made the decision to get off xanax because they didn't. want to have like a baby born addicted to xanax. Like That was my main concern was that. It wasn't. You know, all I had to do is not refill my prescription for it would have kept refilling my prescriptions, I would have kept taking it Okay, and then I just recently like after I found out like. You know I have i'm like after I suspected I had this personality disorder I let my doctor know that i've been lying to doctors for many years to get the drugs that I was. about how I really like think my life is part of it was like real like. I didn't think that a part of it was like yeah I do need dance oh my God my, I have three kids like they're off the walls they're psycho there's so much work I need xanax to like relax and unwind but, like the truth is like i've been like really addicted to xanax and. It. Just. I take. As much as I can to not. block out and be like a neglectful parent, but I also take so much that. They don't like. pay attention to my problems like being addicted to it and spending money and cheating on my husband and having sex all the time. Okay."
462.0,Provider,"All right. let's see any legal history, do you lies dwi arrests prison sentences."
15524.0,Patient,I have one do you I. Was 21. And that's it okay.
462.0,Provider,"And then I mentioned the limits of confidentiality having to report child abuse elder abuse, I also have to report intention to harm yourself or harm someone else, so I just let everyone know that as well. Have you ever attempted to commit suicide."
15524.0,Patient,"When I was 16. I was I had cut myself one time with a razor blade in my bathroom. Just like all the way up both my arms. And my mom and my dad found out. And then. I don't know if you would consider like. The that. It was an accidental overdose, but I could have killed myself, you know. i'm just those two."
462.0,Provider,incidents and how old were you again with the accidental overdose.
15524.0,Patient,was probably 17.
462.0,Provider,or 18 okay. And did the self harm cutting continue after that.
15524.0,Patient,"No, it was just a one time."
462.0,Provider,"One time, so you, since then, you have an engaged in any type of self harm putting like. yourself a hitting your head against the wall anything like that. Running Okay, and then have you been having suicidal thoughts. Since then."
15524.0,Patient,"um no because i've been on xanax and I didn't. I never have suicidal thoughts when i'm on xanax that's part of like part of the reason why I don't feel everything from the personality disorders, because the xanax kind of numbs me. Right, but then like when I got off of it this pregnancy. was what I was was when I felt those feelings. Like I really, really wanted to die if my I was like if you do forget divorce, then I will never forgive myself. For. bringing up our marriage and right here my family like I can't blame you for divorcing me because of what i've done and where we are right now, but if you can't forgive me. It realized that i've been living with this undiagnosed disorder this undiagnosed mental illness that i'm really trying to work on right now. Then i'm just never I just can't forgive myself. Just like the one relationship that I really, really don't want to lose you know. But it's also like i've i've pushed him like so far, like i've stolen money from him. I have cheated on him with like. Several people. which you don't have with one of our employees. at work."
462.0,Provider,you mean. When you were bartending.
15524.0,Patient,"yeah yeah cuz you he's the manager. he's a manager, so I cheated on him with a Co worker. And then he I got pregnant with him last year. And I had a miscarriage. And I don't think that Dan do dad did know that it was it wasn't his until you read my diary he read by diary that."
462.0,Provider,I employee.
15524.0,Patient,"I have a diary that I only write in one absolutely fucked up on xanax. I didn't even I totally forgot about it, it was from like a year ago and Dan read all of it, it says everything says. Every really about that. It just it just talks about all the people i've had sex with basically. It how much I hate Dan and how much I never wanted to marry him because for a while, like you're really did want to get divorced it, I felt like. stuck in traffic, because I was like well what am I going to do if I a divorce like where the Fuck am I going to go like I don't have anything you know i'm in debt I don't have a fucking. I don't have credit to an apartment I don't have money to get an apartment I don't have shit. OK."
462.0,Provider,"The currently where do you stand with the marriage or where does he stand is the divorce, going to be happening, do you consider yourself still together separated."
15524.0,Patient,"Well, he considers a separated I consider us still together kind of even though we're not I mean he's we sleep in different rooms, so he doesn't. You know, he still wants to get divorced, but he also I mean I told him I wasn't going to do, mediation, because I want to get divorced That was really the only way that we get divorced, because we both cannot hire attorneys to like he can hire an attorney file for divorce and then. I get fucking take him to court. That could be thousands and thousands of dollars and it's just like."
462.0,Provider,Right.
15524.0,Patient,"I think I think he's just he he feels trapped right now, like, I feel trapped like a year ago okay."
462.0,Provider,"Okay, and so it sounds like. The source of your recent. suicidal thoughts and you messaging him those things about wanting to kill yourself is really, as you said, this is a relationship and you don't want to lose it it's one of your last ones you've had a lot of because of the bb D you've had a lot of. lost relationships, and so it hit you really hard. When the reality of divorce sunken."
15524.0,Patient,"yeah and that was that's like the fear of or real abandonment right. Like that was like abandonment that was real in my face, and I was like. I really felt like I wanted to not live anymore."
462.0,Provider,"yeah Okay, and so, then how about currently have you been having suicidal ideation sense that that episode, as you described are you kind of shout it out, I want to kill myself to him all of that have you been. Having suicidal thoughts."
15524.0,Patient,"No, but I told him. At any time my mind is so impulsive it my feelings are so over reactive that I could totally convinced myself to kill myself. If I really, really told my mind like. That this is how i'm going to feel right now and. Like those feelings are real, you know, I feel, those are real it's just that. I like in the thing I think with. People like me, are like you're impulsive enough to act on it. that's just what I told him i'm like you know I would impulsively kill myself."
462.0,Provider,"Okay, so do you have a method in mind or any access to firearms or any weapons or any way that you could very quickly and easily impulsively act on that."
15524.0,Patient,"No, no."
462.0,Provider,"Okay, do you have a plan to do so in your your mind that you've started to formulate and work out. No okay you're just more concerned of your own impulsivity. yeah okay so there's no active ideation there was the big event that sparked what you were saying wanting to kill yourself to your husband and you have no method, and you have no plan that you want to carry out, but you do, you are concerned about your impulsivity. yeah okay So how do you think. Just between now and then you know, the next time we meet and i'll See you in group on Tuesday, how do you think you can keep yourself safe away from that impulsivity is there's someone you can reach out to the thoughts start to pop up."
15524.0,Patient,You know.
462.0,Provider,"Okay Okay, so that can be the plan for now if those suicidal thoughts start to pop up. You can call him right and just make sure that you are very aware of these thoughts and the impulsivity that you've experienced in the past right and just try to be extra. cautious, especially because you are pregnant, right now, right so it's important to keep yourself safe, so we can create a safety plan for that next time we meet but. The good news is like you said you don't actively want to you're not actively seeking out away you don't have an axe access to weapons so do you feel safe as far as suicidality goes."
15524.0,Patient,"yeah and I don't want to kill me I don't wanna I don't want to kill my baby, you know, like I would never kill myself and kill my baby like I really, really fought hard to not kill my baby."
462.0,Provider,"Right right it's just the you're afraid of your own actions, because you've seen yourself be very impulsive for. A long."
15524.0,Patient,yeah and like i'm scared i'm scared of. Having like. Immense postpartum depression and wanting to kill myself.
462.0,Provider,After I for that to.
15524.0,Patient,"After i'm not pregnant, you know."
462.0,Provider,Right.
15524.0,Patient,"right because right now, like, I have a reason to not kill myself, because then I would be killing a fucking innocent child. And I don't want to do that. And I really I really don't want to kill myself like I love my kids I would never want to leave them. yeah like I would never want to like causing that kind of beating suffering."
462.0,Provider,"Okay um. Alright, so."
15524.0,Patient,"That that won't matter if I. impulsively just act on it, you know."
462.0,Provider,"yeah okay so yeah I think I understand that situation and the setup for that, so you can definitely keep Dan as your you know emergency contact if. Any thoughts come up and you're starting to feel like you're going off that impulsive. rabbit hole, but just also remembering everything you just told me or you don't want to put that pain on your kids that's a very good protective factor you're currently pregnant right you don't want to harm an innocent child do you have a due date."
15524.0,Patient,it's supposed to be February 28 okay.
462.0,Provider,"Alright, so a little over a month. And then, I just wanted to ask you don't have to tell any details or stories, but do you have a history of trauma as far as physical abuse, sexual abuse, emotional abuse anything that's traumatic to you."
15524.0,Patient,"My parents emotionally abused me. My mom was always. yelling at me and like I said she was, I felt like she was. She would embarrass me like she would like tell other people like all of my. Everything you know, like she would tell her friends everything about me should tell my aunties and uncles everything about me. and I feel like she always like I did throw me under the bus because she didn't want to be feel responsible for my actions okay."

And there's a topic each week thats related to mental health, so we check in and everybody else share a high and a low from their last week right something good, something that was challenging and then their thoughts on whatever topic I share so we might talk about coping skills mindfulness. You know we've talked just about the stress of the holidays boundaries communication so it's total variety of mental health. topics and everybody checks in high and low shares their thought on the topic, and then the prescriber checks in at the end of group for anyone receiving meds that might need a refill or have questions."

One thing that maybe in the meantime, you can look up is db T dialectical behavioral therapy, have you ever heard of that."
15524.0,Patient,i've been i've been studying it.
462.0,Provider,"Okay, so that's something that's definitely known to be helpful for the PD so we can kind of start to work through some of that together, so you can keep studying it looking at it and we can do some discussions on it. pull out some topics and ideas for ways that you can start to just feel more in control of your impulsivity your decisions your behaviors and your emotions. Okay okay all right kylie well good i'm glad you made it in today glad we got to connect and I will be seeing you next week have a great weekend."
15524.0,Patient,"Thank you, you too bye Jesse."
462.0,Provider,"All right, can you please note. very specifically that safety protocol suicide protocol was completed, and that the patient adamantly denies. Any method any plan or any desire to commit suicide, you can state that her protective factor that she shared is she's currently eight months pregnant so she knows, she would be killing an innocent child she does not want to do that. As well as she does not want to put that pain upon her three children. And then, that the suicidal ideation that she experienced recently was in response to her husband wanting a divorce and she does, I would say it's pretty clear she has the PD borderline personality disorder. And that makes the abandonment really tough So if you could just note all that but also state that she does fear her own impulsivity, so we are going to continue to monitor i'm going to put her on. weekly individual appointments her safety plan for this week is to if she noticed any thoughts come up contact her husband. And then, in the next session we will create an in depth safety plan and just monitor that impulsivity social be seeing me and group and then an individual so should be in twice a week, due to the sensitivity of her case being pregnant. And having untreated undiagnosed borderline personality disorder. Thank you."
