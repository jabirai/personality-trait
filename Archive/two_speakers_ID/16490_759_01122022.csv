But I was trying for like a week in advance to get a hold of a psychiatrist but she's been on vacation I have an appointment with her right after you. But we already got the refill. These are some of the things that has happened show you see if I can turn my camera around here. i'm going to do that.

16490.0,Patient,yeah he wrote that on my wall.
759.0,Provider,Oh gosh.
16490.0,Patient,"stuck at mom. um he did my neighbor's house and through all my recyclables that I give to the homeless people around here into her backyard. I mean glass everywhere. Oh yeah and then I had to go over there and clean up she called the COPs on me. And then, when I was in her backyard cleaning up gannon was laughing the whole time because he thought it was so hilarious and i'm really not thinking it's funny so I started yelling at them because i'm angry like this is not okay behavior. yeah and then he starts screaming at me and having a bogo meltdown in her backyard because i'm yelling at him. This is a normal thing that parents would yell at a kid for i'm sorry you don't throw glass in a neighbor's yard yeah the COPs called on me yeah i'm upset gannon. And you're laughing while i'm doing the cleanup that you're not doing because there's broken bottles, the only thing I made him pick up. was like the plastic and cans stuff like that they had like a bunch of stuff some of its cokes you know some of its ginger ale some of its water some of its beer i've had this stuff for over four years and then I just hand out in bags to people. yeah I go when I dumpsters. And then, and then after that happened he runs in the House of hers I can't control them he went he wanted to go up on our balcony so he wants analysis gets. frickin model over goddamn newly done floors and then she starts saying man he's doing this i'm like I don't have any money to give you on this one, I am doing the best I can right now. And I have no way of cleaning it I don't have a carpet cleaner I don't have. You know anything to do this for you and I have no money, so I am sorry that he just did that I don't know what to tell you at this point. And then he runs out of the House when I yell at him at a cost some lady who's just like walking her baby and her dog and says my mom slapped me go beat her ass. So that lady calls the COPs on me right afterwards and, by the way, the whole entire time right before that we were in. My neighbor Sean tells backyard, so if I had slapped him, she would have fucking seen it I didn't slap him I got him on I had him against the wall, because he was starting to hit his head and I was trying to stop him. And I said gannon you need to take some breaths right now, you need to breathe with me. And that's. Set him off even worse because he's not listening to the breathing thing because he thinks that's some kind of insult and he took catch up and sprayed my whole backyard with it. He got when he was in the shower i'm usually helping in the shower I was literally right here and he's like right there. In the shower getting ready. And look he likes to look at himself in the mirror he got into my frickin leave in conditioner and painted the mirror with it i'm literally like two feet away from me, does that anyways this has been going on. and bobs yeah he's telling the COPs he pogo over the frickin Wall, the wall is like seven feet this isn't happening dude and plus you don't have a Pole vault. I lay On top of that it's just it's been non frickin stop he's stealing candy this morning he got into a chocolate ice cream Cone and tried to have it for breakfast and hide it from me then threw it across the room. I had to clean that up, I saw chocolate on my fucking couch over there i'm just i'm tired. And I honestly spent all the way last night. til 1030 from four o'clock to 1030 just with ibs problems which I don't know if you've ever had but Jesus It makes you feel extremely tired. And I just feel like it's like you take the poop out of you like you just got sick you get the chills. you're pooping nonstop and it just hurts, and I just wanted to lay down and have a movie time with him because I could let them watch TV because he only got to 17 at school and the rule is 30 you get 30 minutes 35 and higher you get an hour, but he got to 17 so I couldn't let him. And I bought a box of chocolates, because I wanted to split those with him. When he had a good day right. At the bottom special for him when I went to walmart to get his medication so i'm sitting down. i'm like really tired, I just want to take a nap so I have him with me he can watch, you know boy called Christmas, I can just hold him. And then I can take my nap and he runs out. For two seconds went back in lay down with me we're watching the movie I get up at some point, because I don't know if you can tell, but i'm losing my voice."
759.0,Provider,um.
16490.0,Patient,"And I have been for three days now, and so I went out and I got myself some throat coat coffee not coffee but cheated to calm it down. yeah and my honey is all hard and I don't know what the hell is that about, then he goes and he um. He had already eaten nine pieces of candy. So I take away the movie but i'm going to timeout Rome and tell them no now you don't get the TV now you don't get the candy at all, and now you don't get the movie either."
759.0,Provider,yeah.
16490.0,Patient,"And i'm just i'm really at the end of my rope you know this morning he's screaming at me trying to eat chocolate for breakfast I say no, and then you keep it up and i'll let you go to school, I want pizza I love pizza, do you not get I don't feel good. And I just know that either by the way my frigging bill has gone up extremely because he will leave the frickin goddamn thing alone yesterday added at 64 degrees on the cooling side like who needs air conditioner in the middle of fucking winter man. yeah and this morning it was 75 or 76 I barely could get out of bed at five o'clock this morning because I was so tired and having. A man who. was really starting to move. So no i'm really not good right now."
759.0,Provider,I know I know this is a lot caitlin. lives.
16490.0,Patient,"And he's telling me oh he's gonna tell the school i'm talking about taking out his eyeballs when he's saying that shipped me kick me in the stomach this morning. And I have to stop them from voting himself and doing all this other crap I haven't took care of myself at all I haven't brushed my teeth, today I haven't taken a shower day all I did this was soon as he went to school is I went back to fucking bed. And the only reason I was at 1230 with so I could checking they thought this appointment was at 131 o'clock so I thought I was doing the right. yeah oh Fuck and I don't let myself cry because I don't want him to see it because I don't want him to know how much he's hurting me, but this isn't the only message is written on my walls just keeps going on and on, he broke my door. I mean, he literally took it off the hinges because I wouldn't let him sleep in my room after you through fucking glass bottles over the neighbor's house and. got the COPs here twice and he lied to the COPs when they came in says that I slapped him again they had to go visit the next door neighbor and she she's all it i'm like I was in I was in her backyard she went this whole damn thing."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16490.0,Patient,"I did yell i'm getting angry, these things are not okay."
759.0,Provider,"yeah why he's doing this, not okay super frustrating to you is his mother to you as a caregiver and you're the only one that's taking care of him so. The other stress with dad and you're not feeling well you know it's a recipe for disaster, you know, like in terms of. How you're feeling and what he's doing to you and i'm sorry that you have to go through this with them, and I know you just want to rush like you just want to take a break, you know and and for your son to act Okay, you know when not home."
16490.0,Patient,"pretty much. I promise i'm just like courage is leading that i'd start taking breaths once a day which i'm trying to do, but i'm really just at the end of my rope. yeah I didn't want to go to my home home, but I can't come when the COPs came, he said, oh we don't take care of like 10 year olds, we only do 12 and up and do assessments on them, they won't do it for can."
759.0,Provider,"Help this can again. How old is again and again, these 1010 oh."
16490.0,Patient,"No he used to be the sweetest fucking boy. everson schools and the behavioral schools, they forced me to put them in because they runs for traffic he's just gotten worse kids around him he's telling me they're telling him about stuff like squid game and South park and sausage party we don't even have TV. I don't even let him get on the Internet. I have to just like it's been. A lot me and i'm just doing my best to protect the damn kid and stop him from doing this stuff and saying this stuff he's learning at school he's lending racial slurs at school. You don't even know how they work he just uses them yes right people but it's still not okay my best friend is a boy to see my neighbors are, this is not okay behavior. Then, of course. When he does that they think it comes from me. yeah that makes me feel fucking worse. nah."
759.0,Provider,yeah no you just want to scream.
16490.0,Patient,alrighty screen so much I can't anymore.
759.0,Provider,yeah that's losing your place yeah.
16490.0,Patient,"swear to God is just so fucking much all the time I just I hope these freaking MED start kicking in again soon, because I can't keep doing this. We cannot not have him on his meds and was going so well when he was on his."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm i've been.
16490.0,Patient,"Really really against putting him on meds Intel just like about the two months ago, in October, and they were trying to push adderall and fucking Ritalin and shes and i'm just know. We only have one law fussing and strattera because i'm not okay with putting my 10 year old son on legal methamphetamine sorry not sorry not going to do it okay. So that's where i'm at right now, you know."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16490.0,Patient,"i'm trying my hardest, like, I know I. I usually like will lean on alcohol and these kinds of situations once using bed and just like have like a night on the weekends. Just de stress, but i'm trying really hard not to do that because financially I can't and I don't even know if social security is going to take away my social security right now I didn't tell you about that one that's another thing that happened."
759.0,Provider,that's another thing that happened that the right be taking away your social security money.
16490.0,Patient,"i've been on it, since I was 18 i'm a high school dropout I never really went to eddie schooling last time I had a job they try to take it away when I was working at Salvation Army through a mental health Program."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16490.0,Patient,"Now, because i'm doing ah assess for my son and only getting $300 they're trying to stay, that means that I can work dude i've been doing this work since day one, I just never was paid for it. Basically I wipe his ass I hope gets a conditioner is where I have to clean up after him everything he does and and they don't even do the mental health part. They only do the physical part, like, I have to clean up after him after meals, I have to do this, and some of this stuff don't even count cuz he's only fed. yeah they don't even fucking care like if you're just supposed to be doing this stuff anyways but it's just to the point that, like I take care of things that normal parents would not have to do. only get $300 a month for that and that's not enough to make rent or any of my bills or anything else I need to do so that's added stress and then on top of that, the calfresh people took my frickin benefits from 99 to $24 for the same damn fucking reason."
759.0,Provider,Oh wow. Excuse me.
16490.0,Patient,No i'm sorry i'm costing so much i'm just really. No yearly.
759.0,Provider,"Then by guy i'm at lots of words to tell you, you know because you're trying your best it seems. Like and you need your son to get on his medication for him to come, be able to come down and be more reasonable, and you know, like it's it's a little to tell you, because it's a you know, like it's a hard situation to be in you know your mother and you're trying, and you know by stressful. Now you're having trouble the SSI that's another added stress."
16490.0,Patient,"yeah well that's a size situation area reevaluation on the phone and they made decent some things and they needed more information, so they made me fill out the same basic stuff. And a whole packet and making my dad do it too. And that they haven't done since I signed up for social security, which is making me super paranoid that they're going to take it away and i'm already a very anxious person. So it's not helping."
759.0,Provider,it's not helping you yeah.
16490.0,Patient,"Also, my best friend is out of town visiting here frickin fiance. I think he's either in Florida or Texas, I know his name is tax, I think it might be Florida. US tax in Florida anyways she's not here, so I don't have a lot of support in person, either."
759.0,Provider,yeah so you just waiting for her to get back and yeah this your dad do you have a good I forget did you have do you have a good no good relationship with the dad.
16490.0,Patient,"I mean it's okay it's just it can be very explosive because he's the landlord here. Again, and breaking doors and putting holes in walls doesn't sit well with him and he takes it out on me. it's like i'm restraining him and stopping like I want to stay at least 70% of the damn finch."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16490.0,Patient,"But i'm not i'm not capable of doing it all the time. yeah and sometimes I just don't catch it in time he's hitting his head next to the wall, you know, like they got that next to the fridge now gotten in my door."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16490.0,Patient,"And that's like he just yells at me. and makes me feel way shitty I don't have a lot of support there, thankfully, his wife is my support."
759.0,Provider,Myself and step mom is some point of okay good.
16490.0,Patient,And I just watch a lot of historical stuff because it makes me feel calm.

759.0,Provider,Because it costs good. know what to do to calm yourself down.
16490.0,Patient,"Because it's been also also lately for like a whole week I didn't have Internet, which means again and had no streaming on netflix for kids which made things a lot harder to. Know prime kids are PBS which I bought so. I got all those things just so that he'd have educational TV. Yes, lily. And stuff like that and paying go, which is the main character, you see, when my my my pictures, not on. yeah that's tango that's his favorite show."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16490.0,Patient,"So these are all appropriate kid shows um but his friends are not the same. They say a lot that he you know any lies lies, as people beat him up and do stuff at school, they got one on ones with him."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16490.0,Patient,"They have one on ones, plus they have certain people that watch certain sex on the playground so there's like somebody over at the volleyball court. Somebody over at the basketball court somebody over in the field there's no way in hell anything's going down without them, seeing it's a special needs school for behavioral and autistic kids."
759.0,Provider,"So they know the Dell, you know you know how to handle the kids who you know."
16490.0,Patient,"I got in lies about stuff like he told me this morning he's going to tell the teacher that I was saying, I was gonna buy it out his eyes, he said that to me. He said he's gonna bite out my eyes and stabbed me in my sleep and then poison. I am so sick of the threats. i've tried to put a lock on my door and he broke it. Because he wants to sleep in my room all the time and he's a 10 year old I can't let him sleep anymore in my room all the time guys gonna hit puberty soon. yeah gonna make it a Norman bates situation we don't need that. i've already got it hard enough, we don't need him killing mom so and I get so frustrated because i'm trying really hard not to believe in group homes and hospitals, because that was my ordeal that I lived through from age 12 to 16."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16490.0,Patient,"But I was actually being abused in the home, I mean like choked out punched in the face like constant abused and it come from my dad my step dad and my stepsister so. I just like don't want that to be his life I have done everything to stop the cycle, I have done everything to try to keep him out of group homes, but he seems to think. That, if he runs away or if he goes to a group home or if he goes to a hospital that he's going to be able to do whatever the hell, he wants no one's going to stop him."
759.0,Provider,Does not the case.
16490.0,Patient,"No it's not but he doesn't listen. You can ask my step mom they know to I told the COPs here, you can ask Dan and enough to stick grandparents, you can talk to the vm RC workers. Fear of this to work or you can talk to a school, they will back me up he is a liar. Does this stuff just to. try to get anything he can out of anyone, you know, and he likes to try to push my buttons."
759.0,Provider,and lay the situation so yeah.
16490.0,Patient,"So he does this stuff you know and it just drives me nuts. i'm constantly cleaning his room he doesn't even want to look in his drawers for clothes and then he yells at me for picking his clothes and it's like well we gotta pick one of them man because you're not making your own. yeah, what do you want me to do just let you go to school naked."
759.0,Provider,yeah.
16490.0,Patient,"Like anything I do everything I do for him is wrong, like everything is going to work and i'm in i'm i've already explained this to people before I was in an abusive relationship, when I had him his father tried to kill me when I was pregnant. pulled out a knife on me he threw me over his shoulder he punched me in the face multiple times I was black blue bruised up when I call the COPs and I was pregnant with gannon. His father's a schizophrenia bipolar. I try not to talk bad about him I just tell again and he was very sick and he's a very sick guy he just needs to take medication and he doesn't but the truth is, I have ptsd because of it, and I am fucking terrified. So there's that and I am an abusive relationship with my son, where he is abusing me in the same types of ways that his father did. stressful because I love this kid so freakin much. That I didn't even care when my X meet me because I didn't have a lot of self respect. Back then. yeah I don't. I don't have a lot of self worth but I cared more about my son that I cared about anything I still do it. really hard with me."
759.0,Provider,"You don't deserve it, you know again to have your 10 year old you know do those things to you and say does. That. hurt a lot, and then to go through the same thing with his father, who was abusive and yeah you have a lot of trauma in your background. You know, like it's hard when you have a trauma and now you're in a difficult situation, with your child who you love dearly but he has you know, on to our kids on the spectrum and it's hard to. You know, manage favors."
16490.0,Patient,"So his thing is he doesn't like loud noises but you do get yelled at when you do bad things I can't just always talk to you, softly when you're being screaming at me and whining at me and throwing stuff in neighbor's yard and being. Like he's being like I can't not discipline him i'm take away his toys, I do I takeaways TV I do I do that kind of stuff too, but I can't. not tell you this is wrong, and I mean just using a parent voice, he says is yelling you know the parent voice it's not yelling it's just a stern voice if. You don't do that you stop that right now that's enough for him to say that i'm yelling."
759.0,Provider,yeah.
16490.0,Patient,"So you understand where i'm angry about. He does get away with almost anything he wants to in the damn house and I don't know why he thinks that going anywhere else would be better, because he does get away with a lot of shares here because I am just one person. at all. Man a group home they're going to be therapists there's going to be like at least four different staff at all times. yeah I can get away with shit. Like anything I kind of want to send them they're just so he finds out damn lucky and staff me and how badly has been treating me, considering that I do so much. And i'm juggling and my house is not clean enough, you know i'm doing everything I can I just did the frickin the frickin. refrigerator because he put ice cream all over it, and spilled it all over the dang thing. So I had to clean the inside, and the outside i'm doing all that and before still disgusting but at least I did the counters and I got. What I was doing when you called and I got the dishes soaking they swept today, but that was all I could manage I didn't take a shower and brush my teeth I haven't done anything for me. Except for watch that documentary. yeah and sleep."
759.0,Provider,"Well, I know you have the call with his psychiatrist, but we can end early you can go and do something for yourself good stuffs important at least let's take a shower before you get home, you know, like the brush your teeth, you know work on yourself for a little bit okay."
16490.0,Patient,"yeah I agree with that i'm sorry but I like i'm. Sorry, I just. I don't know what to do right now."
759.0,Provider,"I know I know well, you have it sounds like you have a working plan you know he's going to get back on this medication right."
16490.0,Patient,Already is as of yesterday night.
759.0,Provider,After yesterday night so he's taking his meds you know you'll see if that you know calms me down and what else can you feel like you couldn't it Sir like you need behavioral specialist I can come to your House and help you with them are.
16490.0,Patient,We have that but they've been on vacation since January.
759.0,Provider,they've been on vacation since January.
16490.0,Patient,January I haven't heard from her since. Like I want to say early December. So she's been. She hasn't been available because she's been off on doing her own family stuff you know.
759.0,Provider,"And well hopefully that starts again, you know you can get some in home help you know with them."
16490.0,Patient,So i'm going to go take your shower because I think it might actually help my voice somewhat.
759.0,Provider,"yeah and then we could get some tea, you know this, I know it's hard to do stuff for yourself because you're always you know, with him, and you know you're always helping him. You know, but getting back to like some basic self care needs just prosperously proper eating, you know doing those kind of things for yourself can be. It can go a long way, you know, like in terms of how you're feeling So if you can get down to the basics of doing those things for yourself, you know, the more the better."
16490.0,Patient,"I do want the one thing that was actually really good that happened before all this stuff's hit the fan. Okay um so I was in my room, I was having a few drinks, it was the weekend right before all this stuff started it was Friday night. And there was a girl outside my window and I heard her yelling get off me don't touch me."
759.0,Provider,mm hmm.
16490.0,Patient,I was on a phone call with one of my best friends who lives down in La and I put the phone down immediately and ran out there and bare feet. And I reiterated her demands it was some 15 year old gold cowering and crying. And then I went I made her way outside my door I got her some pepper spray showed her how to use it and I walked her home.
759.0,Provider,Oh wow your hero.

16490.0,Patient,"Was Good though it to a good there, but I had to throw out all my. recyclables so again and can never do that again, so I can never help the homeless again around here."
759.0,Provider,"yeah but she you care a lot about other people, I know you really care and love your son, so that just makes it more difficult when he behaves."
