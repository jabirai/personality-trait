480.0,Provider,Are you married.
14159.0,Patient,i'm still married by separated for like the longest time and we've been off on off and on like because they're the father of all three weekend is.
480.0,Provider,"huh oh yeah so you've been together, while because your oldest is you said nine. yeah. wow long relationship so on and off hasn't been a healthy relationship, for the most. are unhealthy."
14159.0,Patient,"unhealthy as hell. Both both at you know recovering addicts, or like to push each other, like to like handle each other, like it's not healthy at all like it's not good to be together we just can't."
480.0,Provider,"Okay So what do you think brings you back to him, like after you've been separated a while, then."
14159.0,Patient,I don't know like I just love them so much.
480.0,Provider,"yeah and that's the hardest part is like this is something I tell a lot of people, a lot of people think that if you love someone it means you have to make it work and be with them, but you can love someone and know that you can't have a healthy relationship with them. yeah and that's perfectly acceptable."
14159.0,Patient,"yeah it sucks, this is the way it is it really is."
480.0,Provider,"yeah and that's something that I mean those to me are the hardest relationships to try to let go of because you know you're always going to care about the person, but you also know that being in a relationship with them is going to be damaging to you."
14159.0,Patient,"yeah yeah. I yeah for sure for sure it's like because, like you, kind of know that I don't know if you can like ever find that type of love again."
480.0,Provider,yeah. You can. I like to believe you can I don't know myself.
14159.0,Patient,"yeah yeah. Oh, we ever well I don't know."
480.0,Provider,"So why tell me about your addiction history like How long have you been addicted to watch what was your drug of choice, all of that."
14159.0,Patient,"So I started using on an often late probably 16 hours are really got bad after I had my daughter, so I was like. And it was aussies and then heroin, it was it was actually everything awesome parent code crack like it was all of those things, and you know. We young you think Okay, the doubt you know I mean. You party here party there. Okay, but it just got bad night, then I like had to have it every day, and then I went to so. From 21 to when I got pregnant with my son and 2005 and I went to the clinic and got it without methadone for. An offer probably. Six years six or seven years. And then used again. can stay clean try try try and went into a Dr my mother, for me, a detox when the kit when my son was like 5678 like 2009 um that didn't help i'll never do that again I missed so much worse."
480.0,Provider,I do.
14159.0,Patient,"yeah that as they appear Pierre it's different because they you're there for three days and then then they'd like to kick you out and you still feel like share so you go us again, you know what I mean they give you know coping anything. yeah so that was clean for 10 years on xbox like on suboxone then it's like starting all work and I started like it started using again on off on and off until like recently. And i've been clean for a while, since I started this program. Okay, I mean, I had a little bend those in my system, because I have severe anxiety and I really probably like I had one left my bottle and nutrition and took it I took it anyway so. As."
480.0,Provider,well. So this is the thing that I like about our program is we don't punish people for using because we know that that's a typical part of the recovery process right so like. If you ever have a dirty drug test we're not going to kick you out of the program we're not going to punish you like.
14159.0,Patient,I know i've never understood that i've never understood that.
480.0,Provider,Many of.
14159.0,Patient,You are adding are trying to recover from this and by punishing us for like message out that I just never understood that.
480.0,Provider,"yeah in my mind, I feel, like all that's going to do is keep people from being honest right and. Cover without being honest so that's my thing is like. I like when people are honest about using because that gives you something to work with right if you relapse after."
14159.0,Patient,years.
480.0,Provider,or months of being clean that's valuable information to us it's like. different this time.
14159.0,Patient,"yeah I mean I get that like I mean that I think that's why, like, I, like us, the last time I my doctor I miss a doctor's appointment I to like I said, I have no vehicle, I have no way to make it anywhere. No we're not they would call me and even if nothing so it was like okay so i'm not gonna be like say here, I was dying like I tried for today, three days."
480.0,Provider,"So that's why, when you after the 10 years it was just you were so sick and they wouldn't refill your script. yep yeah wow. So what do you think worked the best for you during those 10 years as far as. Saying clean coping with anxiety, did you learn some coping skills that help."
14159.0,Patient,"I mean, I did I also was on. I was on my benzo is also, though, for a lot like for years and years well actually really ever since I was 18 off and on. Again, I had was on xanax and then you know the doctor may have their mind that Oh well, it's not healthy and so not good that oh we're gonna kick you off those and that became a mess, you know."
480.0,Provider,"Well, especially if you didn't taper really slowly. that's the key with."
14159.0,Patient,Dan I know it was.
480.0,Provider,It was horrible.
14159.0,Patient,"And, like, I feel, like all the doctors up here don't know like they don't care they really don't they're just like oh wow like do you deal with it yeah."
480.0,Provider,"that's hard yeah and unfortunate like. that's why I appreciate the doctors at bright heart that understand the big picture of addiction right so. You have to look at the whole cycle of if we withhold men then they're more likely to go us which will lead to overdose so looking at it from like a harm reduction standpoint, instead of an abstinent standpoint can be really."
14159.0,Patient,"yeah I think it is, I mean this is the first like the doctor's office, I really like that felt comfortable being in. And like being honest and talking honestly and openly about anything I mean i've missed appointments that i'm getting really I it was it's a process of getting used to like the zoom, I guess, and like not going in person to my appointment, so I forget about them. Oh, my yeah yeah so."
480.0,Provider,"Everyone does that's why I tried to just like do as much as I can to help you get into a routine of making appointments because most of the time, once a person makes a couple of appointments gets into a routine, then the compliance part is easy. it's just when you're starting out first getting used to the system first getting used to having to remember everything and. A big thing is like you said, if you don't get reminders I mean. No, I only remember my doctor's appointments because they call me two days ahead of time and say hey you have an appointment on Friday i'm like."
14159.0,Patient,"yeah Oh, I do yeah and and, like everything goes to my email to the doctor's office so and I, and I don't check my i'm not used to check my emails at all ever like I don't have nothing important enough that you had to check them. yeah and so like technology, like all that i'm so bad with it."
480.0,Provider,yeah it's hard it's a big adjustment. What you showed up.
14159.0,Patient,"Here yeah I remember kids like you, you reminded me when we're group was like yep all right one."
480.0,Provider,Last night I totally call don't left a.
14159.0,Patient,"message, did you. I didn't even check my know didn't check it. yeah I just like with remember 11 o'clock. 11 o'clock Thursday I thought it was yesterday and I freaked myself out and i'm like no okay i'm good i'm good."
480.0,Provider,"that's funny. So what do you feel like you want to focus on in individual therapy, he said anxiety is a big deal so probably managing anxiety."
14159.0,Patient,um. I don't know I guess trying to just be like. Okay being alone and. yeah like like everybody has their own life now like my son laughed and went with his father so he's living with his father right now.
480.0,Provider,How old is he.
14159.0,Patient,"Would you like your kids have always been with me always always always 16. And my daughter she's like in the next two weeks, having a baby yeah so she's leaving."
480.0,Provider,Does she live right now currently.
14159.0,Patient,i'm. not really. This is her address she lives with her boyfriend. yeah yeah so.

14159.0,Patient,So weird like.

480.0,Provider,Does he live in Florida.
14159.0,Patient,yeah I mean he went back there so yeah I mean yeah that's where he's from.
480.0,Provider,"So this is not that has been, this is a different."
14159.0,Patient,"Okay yeah I remember when. My husband for a while, for. Like actually bound with them we've never had like I said it's been so it's been so off and on, but most of the time, like it's always bad it's always bad so yeah haven't been with him for. Well, four or five months now. Okay, like actually better together, like, I was, I was done, I couldn't do it anymore."
480.0,Provider,So tell me about the boyfriend.
14159.0,Patient,"um. it's so weird after like I mean i've had boy different weapons here and there, but like i'm so used to my husband that. And now, like trying to get us to somebody I guess I probably shouldn't have like hunter into another relationship."
480.0,Provider,"hey man so i'm not a big fan of like shooting on ourselves. yeah. It was a healthy decision, maybe wasn't but now. there's no use like beating yourself up for a decision, you made previous right."
14159.0,Patient,"I know he wants to come back well we'll see we'll see. I, like him, I like him enough."
480.0,Provider,"Enough maybe not enough to live with them, though."
14159.0,Patient,Maybe not not real sure yeah my son loves him he's good with my kid.
480.0,Provider,that's good that's a big plus.
14159.0,Patient,"yeah huge boss, because if they give not then it would never work and never work."
480.0,Provider,he's with you.
14159.0,Patient,he's been here for three and a half month.
480.0,Provider,"yeah that's pretty significant amount of time, so you. guys know each other pretty well. No red flags yet."
14159.0,Patient,"No, no it's like it's really hard because it's really hard for him, I guess, because were like two other ones are older, and like so. I guess like they really don't like they don't care like have anybody knew they're not going to like take time to get to know them right now the end and that bothers him and I said i'm sorry that was issue but you'll have to deal with that that's a huge issue I guy."
480.0,Provider,I can't help you with. Your kids to want to get to know a guy that's not their father and that's only known their mom.
14159.0,Patient,"for everyone. Like yeah. yeah I know and i'm like yeah that does he doesn't us you'd have to do that, I mean I can't do anything about that. yeah hmm."
480.0,Provider,"Interesting so what would you say daily basis. Is your biggest struggle. Like when do you get the most anxious, is it when your parenting when you're not parenting when you're completely by yourself, when you're bored like."
14159.0,Patient,"What yeah. i'm actually like my anxiety and actually just I don't have like any triggers or anything like I could wake up and be like in a severe like panic anxiety for no reason. No, no. yeah probably like being alone daytime i'm overnight person is or I can sleep, or like I can't sleep there's no having between either I can i'm sleeping all the time or or I don't sleep at all. interested, I have a. I have a really hard time sleeping and it sucks."
480.0,Provider,I can't ever take anything personally.
14159.0,Patient,"um I feel like anything like that, though, that is to see dating and I won't hear my kids or will wake up yeah so like no i've never really taken anything."
480.0,Provider,So something that might be.
14159.0,Patient,Effective. For you i'm tired melatonin I can't take that. It gives you like.
480.0,Provider,Paris and they're not melatonin.
14159.0,Patient,melatonin is intense and.
480.0,Provider,So tries to don't have you tried traffic down.
14159.0,Patient,"i'm not sure, but i've been on. A few a medication for my bipolar."
480.0,Provider,"Oh, you have bipolar okay well that makes. sense, why then you. Leave and then you don't sleep."
14159.0,Patient,yeah I forgot like I forget that i'm bipolar so.
480.0,Provider,Are you medicated for bipolar.
14159.0,Patient,"I was but um ever since I had my son dylan mcdo won't work so like i'm not gonna take it and. i'm my last doctor's office and the the one Ross and tried me on like I said, like 20 different i'm like i'm not doing this, I don't feel like it doesn't make me feel good and we're switching up so much like nothing didn't work i'm not taking anything no so No nine. Like I I have been. Most of my life on lamictal was the only thing that actually worked for me and ever since I had mal tie. It won't it doesn't work. Out of time militia and blaine."
480.0,Provider,How do you spell Malika.
14159.0,Patient,ma Li ke VI.
480.0,Provider,"Oh, my gosh that's so similar to mine I spell it he K."
14159.0,Patient,"Are you, oh no. Oh, my God. My oldest yeah. that's awesome."
480.0,Provider,"I know it's such a rare name to. So his mouth out your youngest. yeah okay oh that's so fun I love it. So yeah so okay medication for bipolar we're not really finding anything useful well, the only reason I was thinking trouser down at night is because that's a really effective sleep aid but also it's an Anti anxiety. So, like when I was on travel down it didn't give me that hung over feeling in the mornings I. make up and it just helped throughout the day with my general anxiety because I was on it for like four years went off of it thinking like I don't need this anymore my anxiety was so high, when I went off of it, so it really did help with my anxiety. So that might be an option it's not super addictive like I never in four years went up on my dose. Okay um so that might be something to consider, we can ask Dr about it, if you want to i'm not trying to force you to take that."
14159.0,Patient,yeah yeah no. um no we like definitely like is an option to try.
480.0,Provider,"Then. And then, as far as managing the bipolar How often do you cycle, do you know."
14159.0,Patient,A lot.
480.0,Provider,"Like really rapid cycling all the time you. kinda okay So how do you manage during your manic phases, do you ever like hallucinate or get paranoid, or is it more just impulsive not sleeping."
14159.0,Patient,or your yeah more just like again like I actually I love romantic I honestly do I.
480.0,Provider,"yeah, which is why it's so hard for bipolar people to stay medicated because the manic part is so fun."
14159.0,Patient,yeah like I can get I can accomplish so much shit.
480.0,Provider,"yeah yeah. yeah but then. The crash is not fun, which is what aaron's rod."
14159.0,Patient,it's not so bad.
480.0,Provider,Oh.
14159.0,Patient,No that's why I that's why I feel like I was like don't feel good right now.
480.0,Provider,You feel like.
14159.0,Patient,Like out for a couple of goals.
480.0,Provider,So what do you do in the depressive episodes. it's.
14159.0,Patient,Easy watch TV yo exactly that.
480.0,Provider,Do you ever have suicidal ideation when you're depressed.
14159.0,Patient,What was it.
480.0,Provider,Do you ever have suicidal ideation when you're.
14159.0,Patient,"Know like I was like I was thinking about like I think about it, but like not like I would ever can do that yeah not to that point and I think if not if people say they've never thought about it that's bullshit everybody has."
480.0,Provider,"yeah I agree, I think, suicidal ideation is nothing scary it's what you do with those thoughts right do you spend hours ruminating and making a plan, or is it just something. is most. People yeah and that's The thing is, most people they just want an escape or they want like the pain to end they don't actually die so when you actually process what the thought means most of the time it's like Oh, I just want to escape my current reality not like permanently."
14159.0,Patient,Right and I like I already know that I just like at the moment i'm just like I hate everything.
480.0,Provider,yeah.
14159.0,Patient,"Well, and I really right now well. It may pass just let me sleep lueck try to."
480.0,Provider,"Exactly and that's I think the best coping skill, if you can sleep in those moments that's the best way to handle it like that's my preferred escape replacement right because drugs are a way to escape. So I gotta replace that with something for a while, so if you're someone who can map fantastic."
14159.0,Patient,Okay yeah. Nothing. The boyfriend he's been in like he's actually been in like rehab like i'm. Like 32nd time so like you know he's got some good coping skills that he saw me so.
480.0,Provider,"I love that. that's awesome I love when. People are familiar with rehab stuff because they do all the psycho education, the coping skills and then i'm like oh good, we can do trauma."
14159.0,Patient,"yeah yeah yeah I mean yeah yeah you've been through it all like I haven't i've never been and I and i'm like. I just I never like i've always had kids i've never i've been the one that had to like be the parent be be the so I can I never sleep could step out and honestly like it's really sad to say, but I kind of kept my shit together well enough that like I didn't have like the state in here."
480.0,Provider,Which is a good thing.
14159.0,Patient,"Like, thank God, I."
480.0,Provider,"never got to that point, but sometimes it's nice to have a rehab escape right like."
14159.0,Patient,you're I wish I could add I mean i'm.
480.0,Provider,"joey exactly. Sometimes now like, I have not been to rehab it's probably been 15 years now, and sometimes now i'm like man I wish I could go to rehab."
14159.0,Patient,yeah that's what he said i'm having to like. To get there.
480.0,Provider,it's just a nice little vacation. you're like oh my God.
14159.0,Patient,"yeah that's what he said, like he likes it he he enjoys rehab and I was like i've never been that sounds so weird to me, but I mean I get it. You get there, you get kind of you kind of just lay around they get you on like he is I mean he was awesome awesome for a while he's done anything now but. yeah he goes he goes there, and you like get off the drugs and get on suboxone and you feel high for a couple days and then. You kind of play now feel Okay, I was like well I guess is the way to do it, I mean i'm roll around on the floor sweat in in sweat Shivers anxiety me my chest art and trying to get clean by myself, every time."
480.0,Provider,i've done it both ways rehabs definitely the preferred way.
14159.0,Patient,"yeah I couldn't imagine, I think that's what like really stopped me from like a like using intensely as the. As harsh."
480.0,Provider,The withdrawals are so.
14159.0,Patient,boring like I I mentally and physically cannot do it yeah.
480.0,Provider,"Which is a good motivating factor for recovery like that's something that I try to get people to associate us with something painful or about experience, because if that's. Where your mind goes like for me my I used all the drugs but alcohol was like my main problem, so I had to train my brain to remember the last time I drank I got really sick like the room was spinning, I was nauseous. So now every drinking. I can physically feel the nausea and the dizziness and like that's such a turnoff so."
14159.0,Patient,that's what I try to.
480.0,Provider,"tell people like correlate thinking about using with like your worst experience and train your brain. To go there, because then it's not going to look appealing."
14159.0,Patient,that's right that's true that's true and.
480.0,Provider,The problem with an addict brain is like we remember all the good times and bad times.
14159.0,Patient,yeah.
480.0,Provider,So it's like that one time I had fun and I was living the life of the party and then I forgot about the 50 million times I was like. Picking shit out of my carpet.
14159.0,Patient,"yeah exactly or rolling on the floor, or just like wanting to rip my own chest of it like I I was like because my husband like. I was like, how do you do this, I cannot do I can't I cannot i'm not physically like inclined to Fuck new this at. ever again like I can do it. You did it twice like bad like that I said this last time I did I was like well, I never did I will never do that again never I was totally off i'm going to walk in off everything use it for like two three minds and no oh my God how."
