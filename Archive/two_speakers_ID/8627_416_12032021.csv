8627.0,Patient,Do you start your sessions every day this early.
416.0,Provider,I started six.
8627.0,Patient,So the by the time I see you in group you like going on for hours.
416.0,Provider,I know what's not.
8627.0,Patient,Like okay.
416.0,Provider,So okay take a moment and wake up.
8627.0,Patient,"and there's a few things going on, that I wanted to talk about. i'm. Just feels like a lot of things are kind of not coming together. In a way, where it feels like they're. The only thing I can take from it, because it feels like things are sort of falling away and falling apart, they start i'm fine you know I need to be going. Moving on. let it go. And the lesson in it, but. It just feels like a lot of things are falling apart or. Certainly painful."
416.0,Provider,what's. what's falling apart.
8627.0,Patient,"um my job, and my relationship. is literally mostly my relationship, and I mean it's not surprising it's not like exactly. Good easy we've been living in different places for a year. which was sucked."
416.0,Provider,I see somebody bring him on trail.
8627.0,Patient,yeah. yeah he's moving on January 1.
416.0,Provider,"Oh, soon to that. That moved quicker than we thought."
8627.0,Patient,yeah.
416.0,Provider,And you had talked about maybe wanting to go there or go to your can be close.
8627.0,Patient,yeah I don't think that's wise.
416.0,Provider,what's going on with at all.
8627.0,Patient,"I think i've just kind of had like. A realization of the last week that a lot of what I was feeling about it worse, was like. Very much caught up in. Like romantic hope and, like my my heavily romanticized. view of the world i'm. kind of clouded money view of reality logic um. And ultimately, you know. I just don't feel that he's made it clear enough that he wants me there you know, like. It feels like I am forcing something instead of. letting things happen in a way that feels natural and that's not really how I live my life typically so I don't really want to start them. um I think I was really struggling with letting go. And yeah. I think I just sort of have to. um. We had a really difficult conversation. Last week. Like last Saturday. or I just kind of called and like we talked for probably four hours, and it was just. Everything kind of came out and. i'm glad that I. broke and needed to finally talk I guess um and it's not that we haven't had conversations about this, but we always just kind of get to the end of the conversation, which ultimately happened this time, which is while we're at an impasse like there's not really a solution here like. What are we supposed to do. And we usually are like we don't want to break up and. I now realize that. I do need them and. I know that he won't because historically is terrible at me relationships will just let them dry and not Greg and. I don't know, maybe we already have you know, maybe I should have broke up with them. Here ago. I just. I just don't I don't want to have someone in my life like. It you know him wanting me there shouldn't even be a question. Is should be certain thought he wants me to be a part of. The other parts of his life, and you know, he should know for certain that he wants me to still be there. And he said to me that. You know there's a part of me that wants to do it alone so i'm. kind of like fun."
416.0,Provider,"Google, my thoughts really painful to hear, though."
8627.0,Patient,"yeah um. But he's very much like you know I feel like I spent a lot of my life alone, you will see that, but I have. Like okay fine you want to be that fucking loner guy yeah I can do this shit I don't know I just kind of have come to. us a little suckers shit a little more time is bullshit um you know he. I liked him a lot, but I think a lot of the way he's acting just makes me feel like he's a spoiled child and I don't really have the patience, for it. So a lot of. him just not know what does it feel like he's grateful for all that he has. And I would I would be lucky, if I had even one sliver of what he has had. His life so. And one thing that really hurt really pissed me off that he said. Was. Like. I can't wait for you to catch up with me. To go do these things. That really pissed me off, because the idea of me catching up to him and soaps, are. started off. Can faces atrophy in life in in every opportunity and privilege that he has had that I haven't and that he's been a little bear I happen, you know, not even just talking about like the societal. Aspects like Okay, well, I was born, like a poor woman and he were born, like a rich white man so."
416.0,Provider,yeah really insensitive thing to say.
8627.0,Patient,"And like he knew that and he apologized right away, but it doesn't make it okay. He also throughout the word, like you, he said at one point in a similar conversation, so I was talking, because then I was like well Fuck you basically like we come from. A completely different class and as much as you want to pretend that we don't that's the reality of like my my world and yours is different, it is. And he was a full i've never felt in you for that, like I don't know i've never like continue anything you know for like lack of pedigree or something. pedigree like that's such a disgusting word to use like little fucking puppy but i'm a woman like i'm not a dog like better Green is just such a gross score."
416.0,Provider,yeah.
8627.0,Patient,"And it's not like he's not like that in any way those but. I don't know it just. it's not even. Those things Those are just stupid patty aspects of this it's it's that. i've basically been in love with this person, since I was 21 years old and i've always I mean we haven't been together that whole time for. Many reasons."
416.0,Provider,yeah.
8627.0,Patient,"We just supporting each other's lives for years, but. i'm. Think. it's just not it's just time. hurt to live. Living Co. I don't know if a younger ideal is notion of what love is and hello, he wanted to leave like. You know, make. insurmountable seeming situations possible. and obviously my larger mind learned that a long time ago, but I think sometimes it takes a while, for your. Emotions and your hard to catch up with that."
416.0,Provider,Of course it does yeah.
8627.0,Patient,"For at least it took mine because. Somehow I still really believed that somewhere. Despite everything that i've seen and been through. I don't know if we're but I did still believe. They think it's a little sick, the loss of time hurts."
416.0,Provider,"yeah. there's a lot of grief that comes along with this. So, have you officially ended it, are you still in conversations."
8627.0,Patient,"No, I haven't. And they don't want to and they don't really know how to me like dude Oh, how to obviously it. just words, but I really don't want to do it, we just feel like and we regret it for a long time, and maybe for."
416.0,Provider,This he.
8627.0,Patient,"got less you. Know it's going to be me. You know sparring. You can't face her. For soccer player hotness last relationship, I mean you know it doesn't have the one prior. Is an mo you can do it. Can I get to you know could see it my street never haven't been broken up with which isn't true it's just not one boys can never do it, they just happen to them. never seem to know when to call something. So. I. that's pointless it's not too many. notice i'm still referring to the lost boys because, ultimately, they are all are still boys all."
416.0,Provider,I know I did notice that and. I know I mean. Okay. It feels like that for sure I mean I get it. Do you feel like it's pretty hard to find. A truly mature. partner in this world.
8627.0,Patient,If I want to keep dating you know. People who are male which I don't necessarily either like. Really don't expect that I will continue to do that.
416.0,Provider,you've taken women in the past year right.
8627.0,Patient,yeah no no seriously like it just never quite ends up being. The same way.
416.0,Provider,"um. I was just going to say now is not the time to. I mean one thing at a time. will be ready at some point if if that's where this goes, you know you'll be ready, but. You don't even have to think about I now."
8627.0,Patient,"know that i'm ready to completely end it, you know, like maybe it's just I think that I know what I need to do, which is just I need to let go when we need to make that clear. to him, which is that, like if he wanted me there that he needs to show me that really show me that and that i'm done. i'm not going to keep like asking to be there. And ultimately, I have a lot of other options and opportunity to go in other other directions in my life like. I think he needs to understand me going years be settling."
416.0,Provider,To get.
8627.0,Patient,You know. he's not like my great hope or something.
416.0,Provider,"I think that's very important for him to understand, because in not in like a threatening way, but just in a. In a you he isn't responsible for your future, and you know that. That. Being with him is a conscious choice. yeah and."
8627.0,Patient,Every time.
416.0,Provider,And that there's sacrifice involved in it for you.
8627.0,Patient,"yeah and i'm starting to realize that as well it's like. there's so many job we were there's three of us there's the manager another's. me who's been working there since February 2020. On transferred from La store in September 2020 and then there's Liz who was just hired in. June, July. And in September, they were like okay one of you is going to be the full time person now and then they made us go through two interviews and then they just throw it out and drew drew it out and, finally, finally, yesterday, my boss Karen took me down like. me, I decided to go with Liz and i'm like great, thank you for finally making a decision not drawing this out forever. and say that, but it was just like it was ridiculous, I mean. No reason it should have taken her two months to decide between the two employees, she has. yeah. And I think that's a great choice Liz is amazing and i'm very happy that you will get to work full time and you know move forward. i'm pissed me off like a little bit um. I. feel like I earned that i've been there through like fucking crazy pandemic and work my ass off, but it's kind of a relief, at the same time, because it means. there's nothing keeping either you know not like that water, but I think having a job that was a little bit better and was offering me health insurance and paid time off and 401k and all of that stuff would have made it a little bit easier to get stuck in San Francisco and. As much as i'm still like there's a kernel of me that's like me Fuck you. Like. Normal mostly I think it's just i'm seeing that things are not. If something's not choosing it's not meant for you, you know."
416.0,Provider,kind of a sign from the universe.
8627.0,Patient,"And it just feels like a lot of things are coming pushing me to go. and definitely not go. towards you know him and Canada, like I don't know that that's really what is meant for me. I think i'm being pushed to go on a larger directions."
416.0,Provider,Like international.
8627.0,Patient,"yeah no I mean like you know I had this whole tough thing that I was doing I had this whole goal and. I think I need to just kind of buckle down and get ready for a little bit more. I mean, of course, the world is just throwing us new areas super curious but."
416.0,Provider,"yeah everything i'm hearing is that oma cron is easily spread, but not as dangerous."
8627.0,Patient,Well that's exciting.
416.0,Provider,"I mean slot great news but. But it's you know it's not it's not deadly like Delta. Is what i'm hearing i'm might be too early, no but that's doesn't sound too terrible so far."
8627.0,Patient,"got some months ago, so it's. I don't know I just feel really pulled in many different directions by like circumstances and. i'm trying to like take in all of the information figure out. What the best path is for me and trying really hard to just focus on what I need and i'm not. I don't want to just follow somebody who doesn't even fucking want me there, I am not that girl. i'm too fucking cool for that, like I just like I don't need to like i'm not going to follow some boy who's like. wishy washy about if you want to be there, like if you wanted me there, he would have said it all along, she would have made it a lot more clear and if he's got any doubt in his mind then i'm not going. Because it's not like it's easy to do it's not like it's an easy, like all just follow you whatever like there's a lot of money involved in trying to get that visa money that kind of fucking have like he might but I don't. You know if he wants to go live in fucking Montreal bless his heart, but I am not going to put in a bunch of work to be with someone who can't decide if they want to be with me obviously yeah. um. it's just like i've been having a. I feel like i've been. asking this person to love me back for way too many years and, like ultimately he does, and he did and it's not like you know it's not as pathetic as it sounds, but it's starting to be done i'm not doing it, I just don't i'm not gonna do that. I just don't I don't need to do that myself I don't need to. I don't know."
416.0,Provider,I mean. I love hearing you talk about how you. are listening to yourself right like your it would be really tempting to kind of continue to follow this but. there's a lot of view that saying no this isn't this isn't giving me what I need like it's making me more anxious i'm going to listen to that i'm going to know that. i'm not ready to take this kind of risk without a little more of a guarantee that there's that it's going to work out.
8627.0,Patient,"yeah and. Of course life gives us no guarantees, but. I guess i'm just. i'm seeing that like. me know being in love is not enough for the county and I know that we are, and I know we love each other, a lot of like a lot like more than i've ever won. In a way, that I feel is really real and true and like big but that doesn't make it. Easy it doesn't make situations lineup doesn't make circumstances. You know fall into place that doesn't mean it's meant. To continue, and I think that's the hardest thing is just knowing when. something's good, but it doesn't mean it was too good anymore, and that really hurt. But. It doesn't mean that like this person wasn't important in my life or the."
416.0,Provider,Is it still important yeah.
8627.0,Patient,"yeah or that like like it wasn't. wrong choice like I don't regret it because I think you were like. I don't know what being lumped in like a hell of a good way feels like, and I think that's an important thing for me to word that experienced and like. Now I know what it's like. And that's valuable. Now I know what it's like to have someone who was like my biggest fan and that's a good thing to know but. it's gonna work. hard."
416.0,Provider,it's really hard.
8627.0,Patient,"it's a very childish lesson, but it hurts in the letter when it hits you think."
416.0,Provider,I don't think it's a very childish lesson. Not at all I think it's a very grown up lesson.
8627.0,Patient,"Meeting this is just like this is the first. mean i've been in love before I want all the time. But. he's just. The big one, so far and that's why it's really hard. I think he's the first person I really felt like real. i'm like yeah like I was young, like this has been someone who cared about since I was 21 years old. For a long time in the schema young person's life."
416.0,Provider,yeah. that's a long time.
8627.0,Patient,It isn't. So we tell him here. consciously I don't think you can follow up for seven years old. You.
416.0,Provider,"guys have been through a lot together and lots of changes and and, ultimately, you are still on the downside right like. vinegar for a long time and you've loved each other for a long time."
8627.0,Patient,"we've only been together like actually together for two years. Now. we're only actually together for a year and then we've been apart for a year. It just feels like we went through so much to finally be together, and then the entire universe just kind of kept trying to pull us apart. And I probably shouldn't have listening to that more."
416.0,Provider,New made the best decisions along the way that you can you knew how to make can look back at ourselves and.
8627.0,Patient,I think it was always choosing. love and emotion and choosing from my art and he never my head. I mean I knew this was inevitable knew it wasn't gonna work.
416.0,Provider,muted.
8627.0,Patient,yeah I was always expecting in. Waiting for the other shoe to drop.
416.0,Provider,"Sorry, I missed that there was some. interference but."
8627.0,Patient,"I just feel like I finally kind of stopped doing that Okay, and finally gotten more comfortable and and then. All this Canada stuff came up, I was like well, of course, i'm going to join you like we're in What do you mean like I just got really comfortable with that fact and then I realized that. he's going without me and he doesn't care if i'm there no he doesn't care if he was not really hurt."
416.0,Provider,What makes you think he doesn't care if he loses here.
8627.0,Patient,"Because if he cared key would make that clear, it would be. there's just no accurate. That shows me."
416.0,Provider,"Well, it just. Just because the language around what you just said, can get a little dangerous right. let's just open and entertain the idea that there may be lots of other reasons why he's not able to you know, he may be scared. He."
8627.0,Patient,What.
416.0,Provider,Would you say.
8627.0,Patient,scared of being.
416.0,Provider,"No, no. And that's fine, I just want to make sure that you're not locked into the narrative of he doesn't love me enough to have me there. yeah because then it starts to be about you and it's not."
8627.0,Patient,"This whole thing is about me actually that's his thing and I need to let it be his thing. This is only he's always really wanted you've always been obsessed with moving to Canada launcher on specific. Which is. who's obsessed with Canada, what weird oh. yeah this is his thing this is what he's always wanted and it's. I need to let it just be heads. I don't need to force my way into it, or you know. Work my ass off to get somewhere that I mean. You know it isn't necessarily mine or for me."
416.0,Provider,"I mean it sounds like he has his own stuff that just he needs to go but stuff worked out. And he's not really ready, because he hasn't done that. Work because he hasn't worked about. he's not really ready to. figure out what he really wants."
8627.0,Patient,"You know he's so fucking wishy washy and it's exhausting and I think the thing with him is he always is moving in and onto the. New place and always kind of trying. he's moved all over the world, his whole last 10 years of his life. he's lived in. Progress Prague Copenhagen. Barcelona la portland. just been all over the place. And i'm just kind of realizing that the thing with him is that he hasn't gotten, to the point where you realize like you know satisfaction and joy comes from you and wherever you are, you can find it you're not going to find it where girls you go."
416.0,Provider,yeah it's not a place it's it's in you know.
8627.0,Patient,"Now I know that and I I able to find joy and satisfaction, wherever I go and and working really hard to get more comfortable in that and grow that part of myself like i'm trying to find. inner peace, you know it's up is that sounds like I understand that, because i've had to I haven't had the ability to go anywhere I fucking you know, have a window to go. I don't really have the patience to deal with. Someone who's just miserable so often. and get so frustrated and feel so stuck, and all this stuff and then thinks that going elsewhere is going to solve it like I don't have the patience to be with someone who has yet to do that work. and I think that's something that i'm realizing cuz. I know. No need to do."
416.0,Provider,"That you know I mean. I always find it to be a miracle when two people managed to like blend together and. And connects long term to me it's like it's magical it's an it's a miracle because it's there were so many reasons why it it shouldn't work, sometimes in what I mean people who bring their own stuff in, and you know, have to evolve together like it's so complicated. But the most important thing when it doesn't work and I you're not quite there yet right, but if it if it doesn't work. most important thing is to not assume that it's because there's something wrong with you right or because you aren't loved enough or lovable and it's really easy to walk away. feeling that way and it's really easy to come up with that narrative, especially when you kind of tend to be on the depressed and anxious side already. So that's that's what always worries me about this stuff and I just want to make sure that that's not the narrative that you have because it isn't. Actually, that okay."
8627.0,Patient,"I mean there's a part of me, that has not hurt but mostly I think I just realized that. he's just an indecisive boy and. he's you know just kind of a little cliche. and"
416.0,Provider,"Sorry, Francis i've got a little monster knocking at my. Before. I do it every morning, what do you. Do last night oh okay well i'm gonna i'm going to be wrapping it up in like 10 minutes you want to get some clothes on. Can you wait this. is like, if you go get your clothes on, then you can watch a five minute show. Only if you give me a kiss first. Okay. Okay sorry about that. Sorry. i'm always hopeful that he's not going to wake up, but sometimes."
8627.0,Patient,"yeah and I don't know I mean I don't really know exactly what the narrative is quite yet, but I know what like. I just I know what. I know what I need to do and it's just let go. and And I don't mean like oh of like. What when you yes i'm not really to do, though. I just need to go like this situation and what are we going to do, and all of the questions around it and i'm just going to meet I just need to let go of. trying to figure out what's the outcome of all of this stuff like I just I need to let go of. The future of it all. And being so concerned about because that's where all my anxiety comes from is this kind of like. You know, fear of. What could happen. And I. Have that expectation."
416.0,Provider,Usually curricular outcome.
8627.0,Patient,"been trying to let go on and so many parts of my life and i'm I was forgetting to do that in this one and it's been really painful and confusing and like. It just doesn't need to be like I don't need to make it so difficult and if some how the universe starts. Turning in a way, where this seems feasible and easy and he starts seeming you know really clearly wants to be there, and maybe i'll end up there, you know i'm not I just need to let go of like. Forcing it and trying to figure it out and all of that aspect of it because it's just not serving us in any way and it's just bringing up a lot of pain and civil conversations and it's not necessary, you know, like in this moment he lives in portland and I live in San Francisco and. You know, he wants to come down. A visit in December and. Maybe I just let that happen and just enjoy that time with this person who. You know, try and not look at it as a whole, the last time we're seeing each other, just like long painful good all of this, like it doesn't have to be that way at all. yeah it might be so i'm scared to like carbonate. there's a huge part of me that thinks, I should just end it now like cutter often but that's like. All be that's."
416.0,Provider,"Not. I love the idea of letting go of the expectation of a particular outcome, are trying to like force a particular outcome because you're right it just adds pressure and anxiety. That isn't necessary, but it is it but it's also difficult thing to do, it's easy to talk about letting go of an outcome, but when your heart is leading you in that direction it's hard to actually do it."
8627.0,Patient,"I mean it's just like my heart, has always led me in whatever direction. This person is for a really long time and."
416.0,Provider,yeah.
8627.0,Patient,"it's not fair to me anymore. And it's like I know i'll be okay, I know, move on and i'll get over it whatever called love again will take shit like I get it i'm you know i'm aware of. Now, but I think the thing that makes me really sad it's like i'll never love someone else the same way. And you've never love anyone the same way, so that's the point there's like this version of it has been so wonderful and it might be something you feel anymore. Like."
416.0,Provider,it's not child it's real.
8627.0,Patient,"I just don't know what i'm supposed to do, I don't know fish and tell them that it's okay to come visit for the holidays you're. Part of me really wants to hear, and I feel like I deserve at least one you know one holiday with this person. But we just finished, it will make it harder and Saturday I don't know what to do."
416.0,Provider,"well. You said you're not ready to really fully let go. So if you haven't. If you haven't stopped loving him are completely let go, how are you going to feel spending the holidays, without him I."
8627.0,Patient,mean i've spent every other holiday I just thought it would be nice.
416.0,Provider,Tough decision. To have to make it right now.
8627.0,Patient,"meaning to get the tickets. Are you getting really expensive. or something. it's like we already have been forcing it for a year, trying so hard to make this thing happen and work, even though we look. Like. And I thought that we were doing a partner with the same goal, which is to be together and then he's going to move to fucking camera."
416.0,Provider,yeah. Thanks really.
8627.0,Patient,"we're not making a. move forward in their lives together Oh, I guess we're not in a partnership, then. Okay."
416.0,Provider,yeah.
8627.0,Patient,he's mostly most wonderful person I know you just be such a spoiled asshole. and slap up. Like. yeah it's just like Jesus Christ you get it together.
416.0,Provider,yeah. Oh. Sorry.
8627.0,Patient,anyway. wrote some stuff down yesterday.
416.0,Provider,yeah Thank you.
8627.0,Patient,"I think these maybe are sort of the lessons that i'm trying to find here. To be do not require force. If it is not happening, it is not meant for you. Those that do not choose, you did not deserve to be chased. Maybe it's all falling away so that you may walk away with ease and grace that you deserve. That go. um if you hold on so tight you suffocate all chance and possibility. So I think that's one."
416.0,Provider,thing that is very wise.
8627.0,Patient,"that's my wise mind, as you say, those are my like guidance. kernels of. emotional intelligence."
416.0,Provider,And mantras.
8627.0,Patient,Word can pretty much.
416.0,Provider,"wrote, let me know four times."
8627.0,Patient,yeah.
416.0,Provider,"and letting go doesn't have to mean breaking up. it's like you said you're not totally ready to do that, and maybe you never will be, but sometimes it's just letting go that takes the pressure off you letting go of that expectation letting go of the of the of the outcome."
8627.0,Patient,"yeah I don't think that I need to I need to be really do I know, but I also think that needs to be communicated to him not like hey you know what. it's okay pressures off i'm letting go of this whole question and quandary and emotional like pickle we're not we don't need to be more like let's just let go of it and. I love you and I know you love me and let's just be present in all of this and all of that, and we don't need to worry. About next month or next year we don't need to do that anymore I just like I just want to take the pressure off of both of us, because they feel like it's just ruining it. and it's not fair diver because it's just not it doesn't get us anywhere, you know it doesn't. change the situation or this or the circumstances it doesn't make things fall into place. You know it's not like if i'm just like holding on canada's going to be like hey, by the way, here's the visa like it's not how it works, no I. yeah and I think. I need to be focusing on like the things I need to accomplish for myself and they don't actually have to do with him. And I think that there was a small part of me that wanted to make those things happen, like, I felt like Oh well, having this goal of like being together will like move me forward in the things I need to do. But if i'm doing them for that reason i'm not the right that's not the right reason to be doing them anyway, so I just need to like. Let go and be comfortable and also i'm trying to just acknowledge that, like i'm in a good place like. I have security in my home, which I haven't had you know really long time just the fact that i've gotten to live in the same spot for being here wow it's been a really long time since i've gone to do that that's been such a relief that I didn't even like know it, but it is and. You know there's like that old hippie bumper sticker like bloom where you're planted. I mean, maybe that's like what I finally get to do and I don't mean need someone in my life who's rushing me to catch up. You know i'm using my own pace, and if this is when I finally get to plant and have some roots for a second and went home. and be rooted in a way, where I get to actually get my shit together, finally, because how are they ever supposed to get my shit together when I was constantly moving and there was no stability like I finally have thought, for the first time since I was a very small child. And I need to take advantage of that and I will be rushed through this process by someone who has had stability his whole life and had every opportunity so like Fuck you i'm not trying to catch up with you i'm going to accelerate at my own speed and move past you."
416.0,Provider,Like you got it.
8627.0,Patient,"it's just bullshit. Sorry, I don't mean to be so preachy."
416.0,Provider,"Now you know, and I i'm just listening here i'm. Just thinking like i'm just a sounding board today, which is also. really great because we have all you have all of the. You know this, you have all these skills, you have the answers."
8627.0,Patient,yeah I do.
416.0,Provider,You just you just need to go through your process to get them.
8627.0,Patient,"yeah yeah No, I do, and I think that's. that's what I just want to make clear to him it's like yeah I don't I do want him to come into the sea and more I do still feel like I love him and i'm not ready to not let them. know that I am ready to just let go of the outcome and just be present and can do what I need. and wishes to just take care of myself and get myself together and maybe that does mean great oh you got all this stuff lined up now, you can totally apply to live Canada that's great or maybe not and maybe I moved to South Korea or. Whatever I don't know, like the entire world is open to me if I just get myself together and it's not for someone else."
416.0,Provider,Exactly.
8627.0,Patient,"i'm just trying to let go. I. don't want to keep. Just like the organic possibility that his wife. Why, I and I don't like having plans, plans are boring plans mean that the universe doesn't get to throw you something incredible i'm not that person and if that's who he needs then it's not me and that's fine. So. yeah I don't know like. I guess i'll tell him that he can come, but that it's from a very different place it was a week."
416.0,Provider,Okay.
8627.0,Patient,and see what he does without information. that's fine.
416.0,Provider,All right.
8627.0,Patient,"i'm like i'm taking my power back, but also sort of putting the ball in his court i'm like look, you can take action now, you can be the one who wants to force this that's fine but i'm not anymore like I don't want to do that. If you want me in your life, and you can make their clear and you can put an action to make that happen, but i'm. um because i've done my part, I have never. i've never made it in question, if I wanted in my life ever so. Well, except maybe a couple times but minimally and when he deserved it. Thanks for listening."
416.0,Provider,"I love it I love the way your brain works. You have all the answers you just need a little support getting there, and you got it."
8627.0,Patient,Just hurts.
416.0,Provider,"Yes, and there's nothing to do but feel it. will be in it. And you are you're not running away from it you're right in it it's not going to hit you later not avoiding it during exactly what you need to do just on her feelings you're having. yeah."
8627.0,Patient,"I don't want to not be that. You want me I don't think you're capable of that. No, I will always have a highly romanticized view world."
416.0,Provider,I hope you do. I hope you don't lose that.
8627.0,Patient,If I haven't yet.
416.0,Provider,Oh.
8627.0,Patient,Good so.
416.0,Provider,"I mean. So, like on a personal level professionally relevant but personal I mean I I love hearing your take on this your perspective, so the the letting go piece from personal experience is really valuable, so I spent a long time my life. trying to force things and. desperately wanted a child. And finally, what I finally let go of trying to force a particular outcome in a relationship, I decided to have a child, on my own. And I did I had a baby with one of my best friends and I raised him and he was the one at the door and. And the funny part about it is first of all it's best decision i've ever made my whole entire life is the most miraculous thing and totally. Just the best thing in the whole entire world, but. Once I let go of a particular image that I had in my life and a particular outcome that I felt like I needed I actually thought of things I really wanted, I met my fiance when when my son was one. They somebody I never would have ever. considered I never would have looked at him twice oh my God, I never would have considered dating him. Well we've been together we're and we're getting married in a month, and you know so. And i'm getting married, for the first time at age i'll be 47 when I get paid. Right like. it's a it's a and then we ended up with a bonus kid did. adopt it like it's just. But, but a lot of like in my life just in my personal experience, letting go of trying to force something trying to come out with a particular expectation and being more open to just what life has to offer. yeah look um. It was it's been a miraculous lesson and I didn't learn it in my 20s I learned in my 40s or maybe late 30s early 40s. And it's been fantastic it's been one of the best lessons ever so if you can learn this in your 20s and practice, it good things are going to come to a."
8627.0,Patient,Group.
416.0,Provider,Oh it's true it's really true. And you listen to yourself.
8627.0,Patient,I think the whole joy of living is that you don't know what's going to happen.
416.0,Provider,Right.
8627.0,Patient,there's so much out there for everyone and and you have no idea and it's I don't expect it all to be like a beautiful things either like I know that there's a lot of. pain and the hard lessons that are still. Like on their way but that's part of listening that's important.
416.0,Provider,that's right you don't want to lose fat either. yeah heartache is part of. that's right.
8627.0,Patient,"i'm okay with not having a plan, I just want to kind of build up my arsenal of skills and have more in my back pocket, so that when life throws things at me, and I can be more capable, but beyond that I don't need to have a plan. Now. Because what's the point points just fall apart."
416.0,Provider,"They do mostly Yes, they do."
8627.0,Patient,Answer silly.
416.0,Provider,"Well, it."
8627.0,Patient,Some people leaving them and that's fine good.
416.0,Provider,"And for some people, it works out, but the but thinking so far ahead and having so many things that you feel like you have to do really takes you also out of the experience of the moment. And so there's a lot to be said, for you know letting go and not you know i'm not like anti plan, but I am. more of a be in the moment because when we're so stuck in that future expectation. We do lose track of what's happening right now yeah."
8627.0,Patient,Exactly. And I just. i'm somewhere really special I don't want to think that.
416.0,Provider,is like.
8627.0,Patient,"Oh, how terrible i'm in San Francisco California, like in like a home that like I finally got to build with my dad and like. i'm with my family i'm like I have friends around to I barely acknowledge or here, but I need to like i'm in this place them in love so much and i've just been. devalued went ahead and I don't want to do that anymore like. very lucky to be wearing and I don't need to be caught up in being elsewhere and ultimately it's moving about where I am like i'm very lucky to be like. A year into therapy and finally feeling capable and to feel my brain functioning and to feel like those crumbs of July way more often like. i'm in a good place and I don't need to second guess it because someone else in my life hasn't done the work to to know when they are also in a really good place."
416.0,Provider,tonight.
8627.0,Patient,Is don't. want to go.

Add just with like family in our very closest people. And then stay at like a lodge afterwards we're going to do that and then totally separately next summer we're going to have just a big ass party. or it's going to be just like i'm the opposite of a crazy Brian i'm like just I just want a big old party so.

416.0,Provider,"i'm excited to yeah so that'll be next summer and like probably the reason we're doing it separately. My dad isn't in great health, so we wanted to just need to make sure he's you know we're doing it soon enough that he can for sure, be there and. You can't really travel anywhere, so it has to be like within a drive of their house and so that's why we chose it to do it this way that it's like once we made the decision to do it, it just felt really right felt really good and. amazing congratulations. Thank you it's so weird to think of getting married at this age, I never thought I would do it, but."
