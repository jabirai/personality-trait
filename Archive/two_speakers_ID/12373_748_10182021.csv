748.0,Provider,"Well, I I just kind of sense. That that there was something like that going on from you when I first saw your face. That you're not exactly feeling. cheerful and. yeah anyway, I am looking forward to our session."
12373.0,Patient,yeah me too.
748.0,Provider,So what's currently going on for you.
12373.0,Patient,"i'm. Well, much. Nothing nothing in particular."
748.0,Provider,You look really sad and you look. weary. weary like you're tired of this.
12373.0,Patient,I am weary it is i'm. Just. A lot been on my mind recently um since our last session you recommended Tara Brock.
748.0,Provider,"Yes, Tara Brock."
12373.0,Patient,And I love her. yeah um. it's. and I don't know what it like if it says in my file but um. I I do a lot of work in the off time just because we only have one session every few weeks so.
748.0,Provider,"not stop you right there. Am I apologize, but it was something I had planned to say at the beginning, and yet I looked at your face, and I was concerned."
12373.0,Patient,isn't.
748.0,Provider,You know how new one day I thought you were only scheduled every two weeks. But they have me scheduled with somebody else in 30 minutes is that what you'd normally done is a 30 minute session.
12373.0,Patient,No i'm supposed to get an hour. Back to me.
748.0,Provider,"that's what I thought, and I saw the schedule this morning and I thought that's wrong, so there may be somebody showing up in 30. Social and I humbly apologize. I will ask them to schedule you next week as well, so they make up a half hour and then make it one hour every week every other week. Okay, so now we'll go backwards, I apologize for the interruption. But you've been saying go ahead with what you were saying. You were said you do a lot of work. sessions, that you have with brighter."
12373.0,Patient,"yeah. Sorry, I wasn't expecting to have like half an hour and. I guess, since I do have sessions every two weeks, I really look forward to our sessions our one on one session."
748.0,Provider,Looking forward to seeing you again.
12373.0,Patient,"And, but back to Terra Brock she's been an immense comfort for me. and I just love her voice and the way she speaks."
748.0,Provider,"I really agree. i'm i'm going to make an ad guess based on what it would feel like to me but almost that you feel violated by the the. fact that you're are disrespected at least by having your sessions, not be honored as the full hour that you deserve and."
12373.0,Patient,"Well, it, I mean i'm i'm not employed right now and. And so you know and. My husband's the only one working so. it's. You know it's just it's kind of hard it's a you know I know people make mistakes it's it's not an intentional thing it's okay. It happens."
748.0,Provider,But it feels personal based on.
12373.0,Patient,"yeah it does it's just um. I isolated myself a lot in the past couple of years and i'm. Opening up to friends has been kind of not an option for me because everybody's going through something. And, and you know. it's just been difficult i'm. Starting therapy this year and opening up to strangers that you've never met about. shift that's happened to you that's pretty traumatizing and kind of you know, the rail. Whereas going in life. And i'm inconsistency, you know it's just not. it's not great for me."
748.0,Provider,"And it's not only inconsistency it's it's. there's a way that it feels for me, anyway, what it would evoke what it would feel like is dismissal. yeah yeah."
12373.0,Patient,"But um. Okay, so let's make the most of the half hour, we do have, and then I will see you again next week. So."
748.0,Provider,"me, you know bit the second appointment is a is a first appointment for someone and there's a there's always a chance they won't appear."
12373.0,Patient,hmm. I hope they do people do need help and.
748.0,Provider,salute.
12373.0,Patient,"Lee amounts of yes, a."
748.0,Provider,way to frame it.
12373.0,Patient,"and yeah. So um. I watched this psychologist on YouTube her duck her name is Dr Romani and she specializes in Narcissus. And it wasn't until this year that I really got into. naming the issues that. That my parents had read that my mom hat. And i'm. So to maximize you know our time together, I try to remember you know with my limited memory. Something that have that I want to bring up with you, you know and sort of untangle together. And i'm I struggle with issues of. People just straight denying you know or dismissing what's going on with me and I feel small. yeah so. i'm sorry it's just. So I isolated myself and. I don't go out much. And I, I was one of the only people out of. You know my friends and acquaintances that like really listen to you know California has mandates for you know social distancing and and staying at home and all of that stuff and. it's just been really you know. really difficult for me to. manage bringing up all this stuff and then you know with Tara leaving and. That was really. I don't know um it was. It was really strange going through that but I kind of had to process it. On my own and like I spoke with. A couple of very close friends who go to therapy as well, and not with bright heart, they have their own. Right and they get. An hour a week. Yes, with their therapists and. We all started around the same time we're all around the same age. and they're just like I can't imagine. What would happen if my therapist left me and. i've had to kind of reconcile it as. A therapist is kind of like a. Like a semester at school, you know they're there to teach you. And you've got a certain amount of time it's not going to be forever, you know so learn what you can from them and. enjoy the time that you guys have together. But it's been difficult it's been difficult for me to to do that, you know case. yeah I mean."
748.0,Provider,It sounds like your relationship with. Tara was very healing for you that's one thing that it was that it was a very helpful therapeutic relationship for you.
12373.0,Patient,"Well um yeah I yeah I would, I would say, show, yes, it was a very good experience um."
748.0,Provider,"And then the other thing I want to say and I don't want to interrupt, but I just want to make sure I express this. therapy is not supposed to be like a semester in school. it's a sacred trust. you're entering the deepest most intimate. expression of your life to another human being and man is a process that deserves to have the time. allowed that is needed which means not only in reference to today, and the fact that both of our expectation was that we would have an hour together. yeah but also in terms of the relationship itself that sometimes for some people, especially when they aren't ready and that's Maybe my judgment in the field, it can be short lived to like you know, two, three months and it's like oh i'm going away."
12373.0,Patient,But yeah.
748.0,Provider,"Other people, it can be yours. yeah and and so. What I hear from you is that you have a deep commitment to your healing and your process. And that you two are willing to have it take as long as it takes and our journey that safe is important."
12373.0,Patient,yeah.
748.0,Provider,"And you, you went into expressing your deep truth with Tara and then she left and you and you process that with her."
12373.0,Patient,"yeah it's just like you know i'm. Like times are hard right now, and you know this."
748.0,Provider,Are you saying that everybody you're about you.
12373.0,Patient,"About about everybody, but also about me um it's just you know I don't want to waste money i'm. Just you know. So that's why I really do the work I. I go and I revisit things in my past and. i'm. i'm turning 40 next year. i'm. it's just so unstable. I don't have any kids. i'm not i'm not in a position to have children. Financially mentally emotionally. The best thing that I could do is to. is to not have good yeah i'm filled with fear and doubt, am I doing the right thing, am I doing is my husband just going along with it, if he he's very supportive, you know, and of course he's you know he's going to go with what what they say and. Thinking about that recently about. myself as a kid i'm. Like I know my family is is. Everybody on my mom's side. This abusive down to my grandfather. I was actually. My grandfather would. join in and. hit me if my mom was upset with me at the time and i'm. I don't want to bring anybody into that. i'm not i'm not in contact with my carrots and then my grandfather my grandparents are dead, but. I, you know as a woman, you just like. Sometimes you want it sometimes you don't. But. I know. The right answer is to not."
748.0,Provider,What it.
12373.0,Patient,costs.
748.0,Provider,"Sometimes you want it, and sometimes you don't."
12373.0,Patient,You don't to create your own field.
748.0,Provider,"Oh Okay, but I thought you meant that I wanted to make sure."
12373.0,Patient,"So I have a lot of doubt, I don't know if I know i'm doing the right thing, but sometimes you know. you hear you hear people say that you know Oh, you know how the kid is the most healing thing you can do I don't want to have a kid so that I can heal I just I don't want to have a kid I just don't know if i'm doing. You know the right thing in my life, and I have problems with my worth because i'm housewife right now and I never imagined myself as a housewife but. When I first started there one of my goals was, I wanted to be a productive member of society, you know. But anyway, i'm."
748.0,Provider,Thinking about him. Are you are you a productive member of society.
12373.0,Patient,I don't know I don't think so. I think i'm a productive member of this family. between my husband and I but. I don't feel that I contribute in any meaningful way. When i'd like to.
748.0,Provider,Do can I give you back about that.
12373.0,Patient,yeah sure.
748.0,Provider,"One of the most significant contributions, a human being can make in my humble opinion, having witnessed it for 30 years, as well as doing selfishly doing my own work, one of the most significant contributions, you can make to the. home. is to do your own work. It takes more courage and more willingness than almost anything else, not to mention Labor, it is a Labor of love, but you are influencing me and their planet and trajectory of history, by taking this on as lofty is that may sound is current. And I know you have difficulty giving. yourself any credit."
12373.0,Patient,Thank you. times almost.
748.0,Provider,No it's not because i'm here.
12373.0,Patient,and
748.0,Provider,"I, and I, you know they may show up. yeah get a notification by now, but i'm in charge of the time, by the way you don't get to take on."
12373.0,Patient,"um. I I had like a flashback i'm. crying children are very. stressful for me. um and I remember. I tried to reconcile with my mom I tried to go back and. I. One time we were out. Together, and there was you know, a child who was acting up and screaming and crying and and. My mom. said to me, you know if that was you. You would have been in the bathroom already and I would have beat the shit out of you. In the bathroom. When you were young. And I was really shocked, she said that, and then I said. wow like you did that, which is like yeah you know I had to teach you how to act in public."
748.0,Provider,"I was going to tell me, she was apologizing and owning how wrong it was."
12373.0,Patient,"she's a she's a very textbook. narcissist she's a covert narcissist. and she'll apologize when the words there of her, yes, but her behavior doesn't change and she still considers herself. You know. She says what she's doing is right time. You know. With them it's just always right for them not really right. Overall."
748.0,Provider,"So what you were saying, though, is that you. made an attempt to do some healing and reconcile with your mother and it sounded like. Especially with the sharing that piece about the experiencing experience of witnessing a child in pain, the two of you, and her reaction to it that you. determined that it was not going to work to do that."
12373.0,Patient,"I know, like just. The reason why we're no contact right now is because last year during the pandemic. My parents are incredibly German phobic and. Be live half an hour and 40 minutes away from me, and I would go every couple of weeks, and I would buy all of their groceries I would fill my SUV with. trader joes costco you know the Korean market just. groceries enough for. Two weeks or more. And then i'm. Their trump supporters and. I. I just don't believe in what. trump supporters believe in I don't believe, the intention is this good. And whether or not you know they're right, the people who do believe in supporting him. They take his ideology and use it for. Just to justify a lot of really horrible things. And I don't believe politics should should do that because we're more evolved than that you know. um. But anyway, um I would try to talk to them, and I would try to say like do you really think that you know this is good for us what's happening, and this was in the midst of the pandemic last year, so it was a lot of writing going on and. A lot of. Just things that were not good. And they walked out from my house, I had invited them over for lunch or whatever, and they walked out the left of their own accord. And then she went and she lied to everybody in my family and said that I kicked her out and i'm. They sold their house which they've been living in for 30 years 20 years and they moved to Pennsylvania to live near my younger brother who is. An air force doctor. and They told everybody that it was because of me that they. They moved across the country, it was because of me that they you know sold their house and that they had felt they blamed their isolation from the pandemic they blamed it all on me. i'm. who's been doing that my whole life i'm. Both of my grandparents passed away thinking, I was just this terrible person who was born to make her life hell. yeah is that the other person show up. We lucked out or I like that."
748.0,Provider,I mean they could show up.
12373.0,Patient,But yeah.
748.0,Provider,"At this point, it's looking. I had a feeling that was going to happen, but I knew I needed to be honest and let you know what."
12373.0,Patient,Thank you for that.
748.0,Provider,"Rather than have it be a surprise so. yeah so i'm i'm responsible for watching whether they found it. So i'll let you know. I understand you're also protecting yourself go ahead, know about how painful it was for you that your grandparents would end up."
12373.0,Patient,"My my grandmother never abused me she was and she was abused by my grandfather. And she could only helplessly sit by. A while she saw my mom and. My grandfather. My mostly my mom and she she didn't speak English very well. But she would always tell me to have a big heart and an open mind, and I think. She said that to try to help me get through it, because she saw."
748.0,Provider,The other person is here i'm sorry.
12373.0,Patient,that's okay.
748.0,Provider,"it's not time yet, but I just want our it is, it is, it is just about time can I can I send you an email, and like you know absolutely do you check your email. yeah when I get you scheduled again so that you're aware of it. Okay i'll try to get something. scheduled this week, but I guess i'm booked into November already, but I will I will ask them to move somebody from next week for sure, but i'll try and do it earlier, if I can i'm so sorry to interrupt."
12373.0,Patient,that's okay.
748.0,Provider,"No, it really wasn't Okay, and I appreciate your understanding."
12373.0,Patient,Thanks i'll See you in group tomorrow.
