9894.0,Patient,hi Catherine Hello.
705.0,Provider,How are you.
9894.0,Patient,"i'm good, how are you."
705.0,Provider,Very well. Well what's going on this Tuesday.
9894.0,Patient,"it's been I mean it's not bad or anything it's just been kind of hectic and my boyfriend's sister and son came down and stayed for a few days, and so they just left like a half an hour ago, or so. So just getting back to kinda the usual."
705.0,Provider,"Having company is sometimes just. Preparing and then, when they actually are here and being the host."
9894.0,Patient,"yeah and it was good that you know I enjoyed it so that was nice it's just it was kind of chaotic, they were supposed to leave yesterday. But then something happened with the truck and they need luckily my boyfriend's McCann that's why it's kind of it's so strange because it's a mixture of like. It was kind of a crappy situation, but it was actually a perfect situation because of where it happened, and when it happened, and the fact that they could just stay here another day and. It wasn't really they already had the time off they didn't have to immediately be back, and so my boyfriend was able to get the part and fix it this morning. So anyways so yeah it's just it was just unexpected that like oh crap something went wrong with the truck and it's like a nine hour drive and so. My boyfriend's like that's not safe to drive nine out, we got to fix that so."
705.0,Provider,"yeah it sounds like lucky for the timing, but then for you it's it's like already the expectation that we're going to leave on a certain day. Prepare knows like."
9894.0,Patient,"I when I when he called me yesterday he's like OK they're gonna have to come back in a bubble blah and i'm like oh Okay, but it was fine you know yeah it's it's not a big deal, I know I think initially I was a little more like. Even when they when I knew they were coming and stuff and I wasn't really feeling good and everything and i'm just like Okay, hopefully. I just I mean, I guess, I was just yeah I kind of anticipate it's going to like not go well, or something you know, but they weren't good, so it was nice, you know."
705.0,Provider,yeah That gives you then based on this experience it went well and so next time to maybe not as much anxiety.
9894.0,Patient,yeah exactly oh so yeah.
705.0,Provider,Are you feeling better to I think physically you weren't filling that while last week.
9894.0,Patient,"I met you know its way it's cuz I mean I am not 100% sure, but I haven't started my periods still and now it's going on, like 40 days and there's no chance i'm pregnant or anything like that, so I know that's not a concern um. But I just think that's kind of exacerbated this stuff plus I noticed when I take, but when I before I get my period I get like headaches and stuff and i'm like the only thing that really helps is like a leave. That kind of screws up the incense kind of hurt my stomach, so I think it was just a combination between like the end sets and. not feel i'm already having cramps like because I need to start my period and I already sometimes just getting nauseous when I need to be on my period, you know it just get these PMs symptoms. And i'm like I don't know I should go I need to make a guy in a call it's been a while, since i've seen a gynecologist. yeah because there might be something else going on, I don't know."
705.0,Provider,Right test to I mean there's so many different ways that they can help you and see what's really going on.
9894.0,Patient,"yeah. I know my sister before they told her something about polycystic. ovaries or something so i'm like yeah maybe I have ovarian cysts i'm not sure, but. So it's just kind of like so and that was the other thing i'm like Sometimes I get kind of Moody and but it wasn't so bad I didn't feel to like you know PMs see or anything."
705.0,Provider,you're able to manage it through and i'm sure everyone had a good time.
9894.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
705.0,Provider,haha and then now you get to rest and recover after having to host everybody.
9894.0,Patient,"yeah I know I hope so, I know i'm a little like, which is good, though, because again it's like I do I need to have some kind of. incentive, I guess, to kind of be like up and moving keeping up on things and cooking and you know, like. I just I mean, I guess, I already kind of do that, but it just gives me that extra incentive to go kind of the extra mile you know, and then I just feel like I have like a purpose, you know. So yeah we had some good talks i've really hadn't met his sister, for you know I mean it's been some years ago now, since we were last like. interacting and everything. So it was nice to have that time to spend with. My boyfriend sister and stuff and get to know each other better, and everything you know."
705.0,Provider,"How would you say to when they were there, and you were up and you're doing things, how is the mood."
9894.0,Patient,"Oh, I mean it was mostly good, but there were times, where I felt a little overwhelmed but it wasn't you know and it's a heaven know it's hard to explain. Because I felt that, like she'd be like do you want me to help you out or do something i'm like, no, no, you know and it's like I do just kind of have this like. Controlling thing not control, but like I just. I want her to relax like and I know she's like her she's busting her butt at work and stuff it's like this is your vacation like please relax and I will take it on don't worry, you know. But at the same time there's a little bit of that stress where i'm just kind of like it's more me, though, putting it on myself that i'm like okay I gotta try to make sure this is ready, and this has been a good to go, and you know the dishes are clean here, and you know that kind of thing. So yeah I was just like no I don't need any help no that's okay. Though like want any help and not that I don't want help kind of but at the same time i'm just like I just rather do it myself. But you know. So yeah."
705.0,Provider,"He any. Times, where you felt like you're trying to make it that that need to be perfect at it and to make it like."
9894.0,Patient,"yeah probably, you know as but at the same time it's weird because yeah it's like we had our own kind of therapy session with each other. Where we're kind of like talking, you know, opening up about things, and so i'd even mentioned that you know, like yeah exactly it's like that's what i'm struggling with. Between you know or just recognizing where it comes from to within my childhood my mom and her behavior and seeing like oh yeah my behaviors like this because her behaviors like this and you know not trying to be in a judgmental way, just like. Learn rolling it out."
705.0,Provider,Exactly yeah.
9894.0,Patient,"So trying to like it's still it's the like the inside. I guess you'd call it like adrenaline or something it's those kinds of like. Body reactions that are harder to like overcome that you know what I mean when the stress gets me like. You know, and I just get kind of like. You know or trumpeted that Lisa didn't overwhelm me to where my mind went blank that's what I hate is when I get stressed and I can't really think straight and then I just feel like. I kind of deteriorate because i'm, just like the so at least I felt like I could you know go from one thing to the next thing to the next thing and not have like an issue with keeping it together, you know. we're multitasking and that you know I felt there's sometimes I do feel like it's getting better where I just feel like I can't multitask like what the simplest things and it's just like you know I don't want to be overwhelmed by like the pettiest of. Of. You know if something else comes along it's like okay it's not going to throw me completely out of whack or something you know."
705.0,Provider,"Is any of that getting used to a certain medication, because sometimes it can take a while to not feel like in the box."
9894.0,Patient,"I know I think i'm not 100% sure, because I knew, when I was like on wellbutrin I got off that like a little while ago now, I mean it's been like over a year now, but I feel like maybe that kind of took time to get out of my system or you know i'm not sure. or even with. So loft because I was on zoloft for a little while before I switched back to lexapro recently and I started feeling that even kind of when I was on zoloft like I was having some. issues with the. fog and everything you know so yeah I do kind of think it can be a medication thing. Which is why I went back to lex purpose lexapro was the first. ssri I ever took the first depression medication I ever started on, and it was just the. Most mild like I didn't notice any real side effects from it, or you know other issues so that's why I decided to just. Stop all the other ones, and just go back to the original kinda you know."
705.0,Provider,"yeah exactly and that's where you know, sometimes medication to, as you probably know, will stop being therapeutic levels, and you have to switch it up, but just like you did, then you come back to what you originally you know and as long as that's working. You know, though, because of your experience of what it, you know what you're feeling balanced and when you're not feeling balance. yeah."
9894.0,Patient,"And so it's it's tough when it's yeah to your own brain, so you kind of have to be like. Wait what's happening or you know what I mean like I don't That was what happened with some of the other medications like a. The side effects and stuff I just didn't really pay attention that those were side effects from the medication until they got to a point where it was like. Wait I don't know why i'm acting so strange earlier why this is like Why am I so much more paranoid all the time, or why are you know so anyway. yeah I don't. That i've just had strange reactions to medications."
705.0,Provider,When you know now the warning signs and those are.
9894.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
705.0,Provider,"something's not. not yet not right with my meds yeah and that's where Catherine anytime is just like when working group to be able, even if you don't think that you need your meds to be changed, but just to start voicing tisha and tell that this is what's going on, I don't know if it means anything. Just to get it out there."
9894.0,Patient,yeah okay.
705.0,Provider,I wanted to go back to where you had the conversation like to me that shares already the level of trust you have with your boyfriend sister.
9894.0,Patient,mm hmm.
705.0,Provider,And how was that to share like you should talk about almost it was like therapeutic or you had your therapy session.
9894.0,Patient,"yeah because yeah she was and because my boyfriend's definitely closed off with. Like he's had some. Like troubling upbringing and you know his parents had been addicted to different drugs and he was in foster care at one point and stuff and so, in his sister's a few years older than him and so. I guess it was. The next day, since they came or when they got here is. Two other sons were here, and so they were asking her questions and she's like answer you know so she has a lot more of this like family history and she's a lot more like open like you'll ask Jay and he's just like. I don't know I don't remember you know and so they're like getting to know all these things, and so that kind of opened up yeah like we're just kind of learning more about our. Similar traumatic sometimes you know family histories and so it's it's I think yeah when you're you can be more open when you're in that sort of environment of people who totally like understand and have their own. experiences that are similar I guess that are sort of like maybe bizarre. Then. you're in good company, you know. Right so um so yeah so that was nice to kinda you know that kind of opens the door for like oh yeah this and then you know we just talking about all kinds of different things. yeah."
705.0,Provider,"And to feel connected like you were saying, where it's similar you don't feel like Oh, am I just saying this, and then people are like I don't relate. Your life they relate I have valid reasons to fill this way."
9894.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
705.0,Provider,What yeah it's i'm so glad Catherine that you're starting to really take a look at piecing together what's connected with childhood and why you know the things that I do is connected to childhood I brought that into adulthood. And as yeah I have the right to change that up if I choose.
9894.0,Patient,"Exactly yeah you know try, or you know again it's not like or the things and I hate to say it like that, like that, but just the things that I don't like about myself, you know and it's like I mean not that you can't. change everything, I suppose, but yeah the the parts that I don't like of my personality or my reactions to things, or whatever you know I mean and not that it's going to ever like the perfect perfect, but I at least can. I don't know I guess yeah if I if I recognize it then I can get a better hold on it, or even like I said, even the perfect just feeling like I have to be perfect can. starting to try to address that and like. You don't have to be perfect, you know. Oh."
705.0,Provider,"yeah you know, like in turpan in a different way where your need to be perfect, is motivating maybe in some sense it's also stress involved, you know it's provoking that stress to come into play, but it's like Okay, can I tone this down if you do make a mistake, can I not internalize this."
9894.0,Patient,"Exactly yes. yeah we're like all right it's fine if you make a mistake exactly it's all just preemptive like. say you can't make a mistake if you do make us to go in a row like act like it's The worst thing in the world, you know. And so, and that's what another thing that it's kind of funny because seth is my boyfriend son his youngest son and he's like talking about his mom and sister because she had come down here with them too. Because her mom lives out here success grandma. Anyway, so his mom's name is Rachel and when she found out about the car issue and that she couldn't go back she's like. I mean i'm just like free get out and she's just kind of like that this high strong I guess that's from what they're saying you know she's just like and i've heard stories from Jay and stuff to that yeah when they were married anyway. And she just like is not a go with the flow roll with the punches you know end of the world ever any mishap is like the end of the world, and so. And I mean it was fortunate, for her to like cuz she's like I have to be back at work i'm like guys running any. But they were like no you don't like they already talked to her boss about it she's like it's fine like. will be okay like this is totally understandable like she's not getting any heat from anybody so anyway. um so I just feel like things like that, because my mom was kind of that way to where, if something was not scheduled she had her day already planned and if we got hurt or something got sick had to go to the doctor was just like. You know, like just so I try to make sure that yeah I want to try to be a more roll with the punches kind of person that like look. You can me, regardless of how you react to it you're still going to have to deal with the situation, so you can react to it like and go berserk or you can try to like just. See the bright side you know that's what I was just saying like hey at least it happened here you weren't already on the road, can you imagine yeah you're five hours away or something and like. the middle of nowhere, and this would have broken or who knows what you know. So, and you have yeah somewhere to stay it's not a financial burden on anybody, and they were able to get it pretty fixed or fixed pretty quickly my boyfriend was able to do it in a short period of time, and you know it's like trying to see all the positives that came from. The situation than the negative side of it, I guess you know."
705.0,Provider,"Nice Catherine, how you gave her. The reframing you just. cognitive behavior therapy with his sister."
9894.0,Patient,"yeah or Well, no, no, it was it's we were talking about it being this was sets mom. But she wasn't around she's she's staying with her mom, but they were telling me how Rachel was reacting so but I was just me and his sister were talking about it and, but you know, so I doubt they'll I don't know if they'll say anything to Rachel about you know. Maybe, who knows, maybe they can try to help spin yeah it's like I kind of do I look at it, as like a. They can take it's not that i'm like spouting wisdom, but it's. If you take that kind of approach, and you can kind of learn like oh yeah so somebody told me this and that sounded like a good thing to say so maybe i'll try saying that and see if that helps yeah."
705.0,Provider,"You are sharing your wisdom you're sharing like a healthy coping skill, where instead of that irrational and you know how it gets away, where the rabbit hole, just like a fish on the hook."
9894.0,Patient,He you know.
705.0,Provider,"To reel it back in and it's like okay here's how to rationalize it. is these that happen and just like you said so common things happen here is, you know if we look at it, this other way and interpreted that it was a good thing that happened here."
9894.0,Patient,mm hmm. yeah I.
705.0,Provider,was even able to fix it.
9894.0,Patient,"yeah exactly so it's more I just hate to not be the person who practices, what I preach because there are some times, where i'd still obviously do ITTO get. High strung over that so I feel like i'm like Oh, today I feel this way it could have something similar can happen 10 days from now, and i'd be like you know, so I just don't want to like. assume how I would behave, I suppose, but in this situation, I was definitely able to like jump to the positive immediately, you know."
705.0,Provider,"I have to say that with that pace to Catherine is that holding yourself to a standard that you have to be able to role model this perfect every time and be able to utilize that were. rationally wise now you're not going to use it all the time, I have to remind myself like I know let's see take a deep breath and then just go back to something, you know that will work. Because that's The other thing to a lot of times you can interpret it a different way and you still may feel. A sense of anger and then with the anger is, what can I do with the anger and. using an outlet yeah. Just you saying that about the the role model and all that is like your mind is there, your mind is focused on Okay, these are you know, cognitive behavior works in your professional life, your personal life and it becomes just automatic."
9894.0,Patient,"yeah yeah exactly, and I do you know I do see the because I was. In a therapy program for about a year so until you are and I wasn't trying to think how long. Maybe like six months went by before I had to restart therapy again because it but yeah so I don't know. I just I learned yeah some techniques and I think you know it is working it's helping to get rewiring, I suppose, for those types of thing your unit yeah learning sorry I feel like i'm just like No one. But i'm. That introspective sort of you know, break down."
705.0,Provider,"And I love to where you said, the rewiring because it is like that, with our brains create. New ways and so sometimes. We we know we're resourceful and we have the resources, but it's more like you said, six months went by you were probably doing what really well you didn't need the tools as much forgot about some of them, but you know where to go and get it."
9894.0,Patient,yeah yeah that's true.
705.0,Provider,yeah you can rely on those those having those soft skills.
9894.0,Patient,mm hmm yeah.
705.0,Provider,that's empowering in itself.
9894.0,Patient,"mm hmm. Definitely that's one of them self working things I guess my most one is like. The my work and, like reaction behavior my behavior reactions to things and trying to like see where the feelings come from, I guess, sometimes you know what triggers what feelings and why and why do I react to things the way that I do and trying to get a grip on it that way you know."
705.0,Provider,Is there one feeling that you've been able to identify that comes up more often.
9894.0,Patient,"i'm. In i'm like recently and. I mean it's just like. That said, it like I don't know I guess lately, I feel like it kind of very like I feel like it's been on the upswing because before it was sadness, like, I was praying a lot a lot a lot a lot. And then, but that's gotten a lot better an anger, sometimes I do, but I am like I think how i'm thinking about it helps because, but I feel like again that's just feels more like a hormonal sometimes, but I do feel more even doubt I guess i'm trying to think like. I don't feel like there's one emotion that really like. stands out. um. Other than just I wouldn't call it apathy i'm. Trying to think of how to work right and just like a low motivation, but not necessarily apathy, so I guess you know that's my main thing is i'm just like I just wish I had more motivation. But i'm still kind of trying to work on that yeah like where does that come from, so I think i'm getting there, and the more I figured that you know and or the social anxiety I guess is what kind of you know, still hinders, but when I have like yeah more like. An interaction, you know it that in itself helps improve with that social anxiety, you know, and so, then. Oh, I know what I was gonna say I guess feelings of guilt guilt is like probably the overwhelming feeling feeling that I always have this guilt that I tried to understand where that comes from. So yeah."
705.0,Provider,"It is with guilt and, especially, knowing what's like that piece it's unhealthy. And the piece yeah be and then, when we even go into shame. And then."
9894.0,Patient,"Like mm hmm low self esteem like exactly it's like the self esteem is what's like really the result of that guilt and shame and everything to the point where it's like. yeah I think that's what holds me back from wanting to like further interact, you know i'm just like i'm so hung up on like. let pass interactions I didn't. year you know things that happen when yeah when my medication or whatever, when I just was acting all cuckoo and it's just like I am like embarrassed and i'm like you know so i'm trying to kind of. still work on I guess dealing with that."
705.0,Provider,"yeah i'm glad I like the the example that you brought up with like, before where. Was did you stop taking your medication or the medication stopped working you think."
9894.0,Patient,"Oh. No like like I said honestly, it was like kind of spiritual say something else sort of happened I think along the ways there, I mean there could have been a medication issue, but I was on zoloft, and I mean i'd already been taking the law for maybe. gosh I don't know like nine months or so by that point. So I really can't say for sure what it what I just know that, like the whole insurrection thing happened there was more like stress from the outside of what was going on, and so that triggered something too. So yeah I would just say it was more like a high stress sort of like. trigger somehow. um. yeah."
705.0,Provider,"yeah it's with with guilt and you know, like with healthy guilt is usually something that. You know, objectively, is wrong, and I think you might have been in the group where we're even talking about like driving under the influence you get caught for that, and you know what's wrong, and so you feel guilty about it but it's healthy because it helps you not do it again. mm hmm So if you can have some type of guilt in that format, but if we go over to the next unhealthy guilt is more of what you're talking about Catherine, where we have high standards for ourselves. Like you were saying you feel guilty, because your friends saw you acting in a way that you wish you wouldn't have. With the disorder that can happen it's like is that then and unhealthy to have that expectation about yourself because you've set the bar high that you never allowed to make a mistake. and being able to then recognize that were. Working on that situation of he didn't know what was going on, you were just trying your best to handle the stress of all that. And can you start to accept forgive. To be able to heal from that."
9894.0,Patient,yeah sorry.
705.0,Provider,"No that's you know don't apologize tears tears, you know, this is a safe zone tears usually do happen and that's just. yeah you can look at this that's different instead of beating yourself up it's just like understanding."
9894.0,Patient,yeah.
705.0,Provider,"And starting the process where. yeah he. There was no at that point, Catherine, there was no way that you could have foreseen what was going to happen."
9894.0,Patient,"yeah and I know I had no like controlled stuff. So I I. i'm like somewhere in between out, I mean like I don't know, I guess, yes, so forgiveness part of the thing I have the hardest time with. or self acceptance or whatever you know."
705.0,Provider,How self compassion like bring it all.
9894.0,Patient,yeah all of it yeah and say I guess that's probably. I haven't I gotta figure that one out. That.
705.0,Provider,"Already, is with just knowing that there's there's more prone to sometimes being more in the depressed or sometimes more in the manic and then you take a situation like what happened at the Capitol where there was a lot of unknowns there was a lot of stress."
9894.0,Patient,"yeah yeah. Well, it just felt like in a you know I am and i'm trying not to be like us, I mean that's why I had to get off social media, and I do kind of feel better in most ways that i'm not on social media anymore and. Because yeah it's like when I just saw how people were other people were reacting to it and stuff in it or not really That was the other thing too, I mean they're just was like an absence of. i'm like hello, this is kind of serious at first it's like my sister is all I didn't even know that happened, or whatever my heart, you know, like so it just I don't know they're just certain things, or I just kind of like I can't like I just say. hey don't know."
705.0,Provider,"And like you were saying, she didn't even know, but you know and then so that experience or what's going on that event, you had a different feeling you had different thoughts tied to it."
9894.0,Patient,yeah exactly.
705.0,Provider,which can mean a different reaction.
9894.0,Patient,"yeah. And so I am. yeah I guess I you know, trying to understand other people's behavior towards things is not. Something that i'm working to not be so I don't know it's like I want to look at it, because I do I almost have this like. Not anthropology but kind of you know, to mean mindset where you're just like kind of curious like Okay, there you know what I mean like what's happening in this world and. Why are people behaving in such a way, you know, and so, then i'm starting to see it, and so, then it starts getting more to the root of like more behavior and more no I don't know."
705.0,Provider,yeah.
9894.0,Patient,Here the hostility.
705.0,Provider,"Your curiosity and also bringing it back to. Your understanding and you're trying to even understand others and how they're reacting. And yeah. really give them a pass because of what they're going through. and put yeah you giving yourself a pass it, this was unheard of, it had never happened before, just like with 911 when that happened and people acted differently."
9894.0,Patient,reaction or.
705.0,Provider,No links for different.
9894.0,Patient,"yeah exactly and that's another I think I mean that's there's you know I wasn't involved in any sort of way but 911 hit me kind of big at that time to, and so I do think there's kind of like a. um I guess I wouldn't compare it to a ptsd, but I would just compare it to like the. harkening back to that kind of feeling somewhat you know but being more a shame, because it's our own countrymen, you know so it's this kind of. sadness was profound sadness and most of like what's happening, you know."
705.0,Provider,"and bringing it back to then. You didn't have anything like this to really have experienced upon like 911 maybe you know a lot of 911 was where you were at the family members, friends and that type of thing, so this one was maybe more intense for you, because of how involved, you are. You know you you felt things, maybe stronger you felt yeah. You know this way or that way can then in time you start to release some of this and forgive yourself that this was what an unusual circumstances."
9894.0,Patient,yeah that's true yeah.
705.0,Provider,"And so, how you react, it may seem to you unusual, but the situation was unusual and so."
9894.0,Patient,"yeah yeah that's true exactly. So I do sometimes I guess yeah i'm starting to see like again my actions versus my reactions in, so I think, maybe you know, trying to decipher between those. helps me understand it better yeah exactly, therefore, maybe, but at the same time, I have that same feeling of like now it's. A fear kind of you know, like what if I What if I lose it, but if something comes up and I have a reaction and I lose it and I can't control, you know what I mean like it's I don't know i'm afraid. So I want to try to you know enough time has gone by, where i'm not feeling so afraid anymore that. But um. yeah."
705.0,Provider,"let's just go through the whatever because sometimes with that worst case scenario is disputing it then so worst case scenario is that. let's say you, you need some assistance and you go to the hospital. So the worst case scenario is you go to the hospital and you get some assistance. Is that okay."
9894.0,Patient,mm hmm.
705.0,Provider,Okay. Is is there even before that of going to the hospital that maybe you could catch yourself in inner being before that.
9894.0,Patient,"yeah you know I know I guess that's the different yeah there's still that unknown that if it did happen again like yeah exactly how would I react differently, because of my previous experience i'm hoping that I would yeah maybe be able to not have. worst case scenario."
705.0,Provider,Right and that's sometimes we're just reeling yourself let let it go all the way to worst case scenario and it's just like if it was and I needed to be hospitalized and i'll be hospitalized.
9894.0,Patient,"And well when I think worst case scenario I think everybody would ditch out on me and say I can't deal with this anymore and i'd be alone, you know. And so that to me is worst case scenario I guess is that. I just you know but it'll it'll are actually i'm like it worst case scenario is like kill somebody or something, but I don't think I could ever get to that point. I hope, not that I can do that work. But. yeah i'm just i'm just sorry i'm just like remembering back to kind of how my mind was at the time. But I still feel like I had at least a certain level of control or of myself in there to where I wouldn't do something that I completely. Because anything violence, murder, all that stuff is just completely boring, to me, to the point where it's like I just couldn't see myself ever. being physically like I might yell at somebody say something act in a kind of angry way, but I don't think I would ever physically harm anybody ever so I at least don't feel so concerned with that ever happening."
705.0,Provider,Right and if you did in the event that you started having that because you're already mindful about it. yeah knowing that you could go and get the assistance that you need before it gets to attend.
9894.0,Patient,yeah yeah exactly.
705.0,Provider,"And that's just having where you feel more in control that you've manage you manage like a really traumatic. You know event and you manage through that. Maybe now that you're reflecting back you would have liked to do things different, but in the moment you just did what you needed to do to survive."
9894.0,Patient,yeah the whole like hindsight is 2020 sort of thing you know.
705.0,Provider,"But it's now lowering the intensity of that what if we're like well I have confidence in myself, now that if I needed to take myself to the hospital I could take myself to the hospital evaluate before it gets too bad and go from there."
9894.0,Patient,Exactly.
705.0,Provider,It is and with the reactions to instead of that how we visualize you know everyone else reactions to our reactions and we grow from there.
9894.0,Patient,Oh yeah.
705.0,Provider,yeah bring back that image to something that's a little bit more balanced.
9894.0,Patient,hmm.
705.0,Provider,"You would use the words more like. I think you said, the you have went did you say the word cocoa or something like."
9894.0,Patient,I think so something like that.
705.0,Provider,"If we were to start reframing like you've been doing. what's something that's more balanced about. You know, instead of the the I went cuckoo I went."
9894.0,Patient,"mm hmm. And i'm trying to think. I mean something I refer to it as like enlightenment too. Because I feel like there was. That, as there was just kind of it was like multifaceted there's different aspects of it. But, like my outward behavior you know at some times anyways um. I don't know what to call it like. i'm just thinking of this conversation that I had when I was having it with my friends and I was telling him what was happening with these vision, you know why I was you know and they're like the fact that you're like. Just not acknowledging that this is not normal behavior that this is not, you know so it's like i'm. More the other way now, so I am. I know I don't I don't really know what to call it, I guess."
705.0,Provider,In that time it felt real and then now that you're reflecting back you you feel like it has enlightened you. and Who gets to decide if he feel enlightened or not.
9894.0,Patient,yeah I know.
705.0,Provider,"Because how would, how would they know if they've never experienced it."
9894.0,Patient,yeah exactly.
705.0,Provider,"And then. you're allowing to that other piece where maybe some of it was unusual. And maybe people couldn't relate. So you had this experience this traumatic event happen, and you had like I think he called it, the the Multi faceted experience or you had the Multi faceted reactions."
9894.0,Patient,mm hmm.
705.0,Provider,To that experience.
9894.0,Patient,"yeah so and i've read stuff like I said it's like a kundalini awakening or third eye or you know they're very similar to the way that they describe how it happens so. I look at it like that, too. It just varies depending on what part of the experience i'm thinking about but um. So yeah as far as reframing I mean I don't know it just it was it was good, it was bad it was like a yin and Yang sort of thing I don't even know how to call them really."
705.0,Provider,Like that I like that I had a Yang yin and Yang experience it's really hard for me to describe it.
9894.0,Patient,that's you yeah. almost like indescribable.
705.0,Provider,But is there a difference of when you say that it was the King and the Yang is just indescribable to saying I went cuckoo.
9894.0,Patient,"yeah, I guess, so I know i'm trying to think if I like associate them any different when I like verbalize it like that, but possibly."
705.0,Provider,"Well, I go for more to if we have that thought if the words cuckoo comes into play it's the thought and the feeling that comes after."
9894.0,Patient,So yeah that like association.
705.0,Provider,yeah so what filling would come up when you say cuckoo.
9894.0,Patient,"No, it depends on how i'm saying cuz sometimes I kind of laugh like a kind of thing or you know, or even think of like one flew over the cuckoo's nest or something you know, like I don't. always take it so seriously, you know but yeah other times I think of like. The fact that was like held on a and I was in like. You know they're those kinds of associations and. So yeah like we're all say like looney tunes you know. So it is weird it's almost like this one sense, where I want to own it because it's like you know what on the same hand it's. It was a. Not like I just say it's just that, because when when I was talking to supply yesterday and will like at least our lives are not boring, you can say that it's like we may have been through some weird stuff, but it certainly has not been boring right, so he."
705.0,Provider,"Right. And that's where. yeah the definition, if you can change it, a lot of times just how we. Take yourselves because i'm. Making Catherine, of how you describe it, even though you have the humor part of it is that your self esteem may take a hit on there."
9894.0,Patient,Were yeah.
705.0,Provider,"yeah if you then have where it was Ying and Yang of it, then the filling may be a little bit more. Healthy about yourself."
9894.0,Patient,"yeah yeah. So let's shoot you know it's still kind of have because even them like as. strange as it was like I think other people should kind of experience it to or some or you know what I mean if they're searching for some kind of spiritual. Change, you know it's something that I want to share for people to try for themselves to try to understand. What maybe if they're filling in some sort of similar way that I was feeling, you know, so I don't see it yeah at least is all bad or all negative or you know. But so yeah even within myself, I guess, like overselling or understand or you know I ever know just looking at this experience as being something that i'm supposed to like share with the world or something. yeah so it's just a my own feelings towards that are just very you know."
705.0,Provider,"Even within that, though, is give yourself permission that there's no timeline of how you're like digging in there and trying to gain new insight."
9894.0,Patient,"yeah I know yeah, I guess, I always feel like I have to like my brain. My brain works all the time that's just like got a new you got it you got to figure it out, you got to understand everything you know, like, I know I don't know what it is, I just have this. thing about me where it's like or like even when i'd be at work and stuff like oh something's gone wrong. i've got to figure it out okay. i'm going to try to figure out what's the problem here, you know, and so I have that mindset where gotta dig to the route to the root figured out and fix it and solve it, and then you know because I always feel good if you solve something you like, then that means. Something life events, though they don't come like."
705.0,Provider,You may never know or they might.
9894.0,Patient,"Exactly yeah I know that's I know I feel like I am i'm trying to apply that to things that it doesn't apply to. or can't apply to or can't be known, I want to know man I can't know it. yeah."
705.0,Provider,"I love know where you are Catherine to be has to me it's a process and you're trusting in the process, and all these things that you're willing to bring you know, to the table here that's all important. is to know yourself better."
9894.0,Patient,"yeah yeah. Exactly learn. Learn myself others and how to hopefully. Better interact, you know."
705.0,Provider,"And had this event not happen to you, where you had these reactions. yeah you wouldn't have sought help you wouldn't have sought counseling you wouldn't have had the self awareness that you have now where some people just continue on with life and not changing anything not being."
9894.0,Patient,yeah exactly. So yeah i'm definitely grateful when all said and done that. That.
705.0,Provider,Exactly and I love to how you brought it back to I don't have a boring life.
9894.0,Patient,Sometimes anyway. Still mundane right.
705.0,Provider,Exactly my life has been interesting.
9894.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
705.0,Provider,And owning that where is the filling with your self esteem more in balance and it's like yeah.

705.0,Provider,You can call in I was going to say to in group to direct chat but then she would. yeah jewelers to schedule it so you're right Catherine. To okay to call into virtual Center because then they'll schedule hers for her.

The. assessment or something I forget what they did they asked me a bunch of like on questions. i'm supposed to follow up with her about I guess going over it, or something and whatever but anyway so that's fine i'll schedule that because I realized, I was like oh wait I don't have any follow up appointment."
705.0,Provider,"That sounds good, to get the results to get the outcome. yeah okay. I am going ahead and booking then on the 12 and then I will do the 26. I like to make sure that it is saved That way we both know that one say and then i'll go back to the 26 at 130. I know to Catherine they're working on the getting the reminders out, but in the meantime, I think you said you're writing it down on something. Great so. 1:30pm again on the 26. And i'm going to save this one. Great so both of those same to Catherine, then I look forward to seeing you in friday's group and then, if you could call the virtual Center go ahead and schedule with chantel and then just keep that going and sounds good. Okay yeah. you're very welcome and before we leave to I always just check is there any suicidal thoughts or anything like that happening today. i'll tie in the event that ever if you have anything, please let me know that's definitely not something we want people to sit on.

All right, and i'll see you Friday and group take care, Catherine."
9894.0,Patient,"Okay, you too, thank you."
705.0,Provider,"Thank you bye. Patient denies feeling suicidal today at assessment would be. Low to moderate risk just because of the past, but today, not feeling suicidal no plan no intent, so it will be low to moderate is still her suicide assessment."
