540.0,Provider,For transcription I am to meeting with Stephen swofford for an individual therapy session.
8103.0,Patient,hey.
540.0,Provider,How are you. what's going on.
8103.0,Patient,Too much same old same old.
540.0,Provider,same old same old. house work than. Any thing going on with your kiddo anything.
8103.0,Patient,yeah. They do it like a statewide protest today through the. vaccine mandate that we're trying to pass her kids 12 to 16 oh wow everybody everybody kept their kids home today the process.
540.0,Provider,"So. So one of the protests entail did they just not bring them to school or anything or. And, did you did you have him stay home. yeah okay."
8103.0,Patient,No. yeah.
540.0,Provider,yeah it's the mandates. gonna be a tough thing.
8103.0,Patient,I know.
540.0,Provider,How what's your stance on everything.
8103.0,Patient,"No, no, you know i'm. i'm gonna go get vaccinated on Wednesday. yeah just one shot."
540.0,Provider,About Johnson and Johnson.
8103.0,Patient,Where it's more I know my works gonna make me do it eventually. I don't know i've got like tickets in San Francisco for a concert that I can't see now unless i'm vaccinated. So.
540.0,Provider,"it's definitely forcing a lot of people to have to get mandate vaccinated and I know that a lot of people it's, not even the vaccine that's been an issue it's been how it's been presented and how it's been forced. So I think that if, like people could just see like it's not really the vaccine that's really, the issue is how we're going about it. yeah. But it's definitely dividing. And it's going to impact our economy at some point, because it's I mean it's just not fair for these mandates and then people are losing their jobs, who are just quitting such not going to be a good thing. But now we haven't had anything like protests, but. that'll happen i'm sure. I think that a lot of the protests usually happen more near you guys when comes our way. yeah we've had a lot of the protests of healthcare workers, so a lot of healthcare workers and stood outside of like the state house. Because it's hard to say now all these people are losing their jobs because they're not getting a vaccine and they're the ones that have been in the trenches that they've been working through the pandemic and. they're just being like tossed. aside, if you don't get vaccinated. So it's definitely tough but, like you said it's sometimes it's inevitable, because now you can't go to concerts there's. plane rides that potentially people can't get like transportation so yeah so you made the appointment one SEC. How does his mom feel your son's mom feel about the vaccination stuff."
8103.0,Patient,"Oh she's totally against it yeah. yeah he's not gonna let him get vaccinated you know, unless you know, we have no choice. Then they'll set for homeschool. Like it didn't work last time. school."
540.0,Provider,"So I wouldn't be surprised if other universities start to open up and they have like non vaccinating universities and schools. I think it's getting to that point where it's going to start to divide things in that way where they're going to want places where people can go if they're not vaccinated especially school. I don't know how much it could, because there are going to be a very like high majority of people that are going to keep their kids home. that's like that whole forced dynamic. Other than that, how have you been doing."
8103.0,Patient,Pretty.
540.0,Provider,"So I wanted to ask you, would you want to do like once a month counseling."
8103.0,Patient,i'm sure.
540.0,Provider,"it's up to you, so what do you feel like you need do you like the like shorter like twice a month counseling or would you like. Like once a month to be able to kind of just go over everything and."
8103.0,Patient,Twice a month works for me.
540.0,Provider,"Okay, all right, so do twice a month, but just know like going forward any time that you want to do that just bring it up to me okay."
8103.0,Patient,We don't have group on Wednesday right.
540.0,Provider,"No, no, we don't do, are you all set with medication."
8103.0,Patient,um yeah I think she.
540.0,Provider,"Oh, she called it in I think for the refill yeah yeah okay yeah no group ones. yeah what that is I don't know if you were in group. Last week I was out sick for you in group last week. Oh no oh yeah I was out sick with my family caught a cold."

540.0,Provider,"Do you want to do the 11am on the first and then the. 15th. Let me put you in. Let me just make sure you're all good with surveys, so does say you have some surveys to do."
8103.0,Patient,let's do I don't even know morning group.
540.0,Provider,"So yeah so you have to still do most of them weekly, so I think that's the pH Q nine and the BAM. So that's still weekly so whether or not try to do them like I mean even every like Sunday just try to keep the same day, whether or not you're just drinking your coffee and doing it. And then you have the adl which is just like daily living activities, so you have three of them to do. Okay, all right. But other than that you're. All good you're on the green other than that."
8103.0,Patient,Very good um you know when the next group is.
540.0,Provider,"So yeah so the next group is not this week, but it's next one, so."
8103.0,Patient,2727 okay yeah. i'll shoot i'm not gonna make that one door.
540.0,Provider,"Okay um plan so when she gives you the if she wrote in the script. What i'll do is i'll write myself a note and then, if she needs to call it, and for you next week hold on I need a pen. Alright, if she needs to call it in for you all have her call it in and then having you come in so you're going to be in group. The third. Right. yeah okay alright so i'll tell her you'll be there, the third. And i'll have her look to see if you need the refill next week and then hot person that can."
8103.0,Patient,speak.
540.0,Provider,"Alright, so that should be good anything else going on."
8103.0,Patient,Really. kind of.
540.0,Provider,"All right, so i'm putting in our appointments for next month. Alright, so we are a good we're all in for next month, but if you need anything in the meantime, you know where i'm at so just contact me okay. All right, alright until next time Steve. Alright, for transcription That was my individual therapy session was Steve so I let him know that going forward if he wants to do, once a month counseling I am okay with that, but he wants to continue with the twice a month, sometimes he has stuff to talk about other times. Other times, he doesn't and I try not to push with him. So whenever it runs its course we just go over the quick things to kind of check in on and then, if something comes up he'll just talk about it. Other than that, I looked at his char everything's good and and I will plan to see him in two weeks, thank you."
