13.0,Provider,"Really Miguel, we know that. You, we can only. distract ourselves for so long, will power. Has a limit it has a finite amount in inside of us. And if you've used it up. With you know. Trying to distract and trying. You know, use the skills that you've learned there's a point where it just doesn't work anymore. So. So help me understand this. timeframe here you're working with workman's COMP which i'm really. Sorry, is. dynamic."
9436.0,Patient,"And so, so I see, I see a surgeon on the. 16th the 16th is a day it's not I thought it was a seven they moved it back to the 16th the surgeon has no hospital. credentials he can't he doesn't perform surgeries he doesn't so it's like a walk through the motions my attorney said it's going to help us and then. To get back to my attorney at new Mexico at the beat it or to my surgeon there um but there's no hospital credentials, with the surgeon yeah."

9436.0,Patient,yeah.
13.0,Provider,"He somehow, you have to get through to. them that you're not a mullingar and it doesn't help to say it i'm anger that doesn't help. You have to just keep saying you know, can you imagine what it's like to have young children and I can't be present for them, because i'm so much distracting pain."
9436.0,Patient,"Right yeah. I did. I did yesterday. Like the flood walls were broken yesterday, but my my I but I need to call my attorney I need to call whoever but I asked my I asked my psychologist like straight up I said. If I get us a light duty job if I do something to distract she said that's not gonna work she said, your that's not the answer. And it sucks like because I know that's not the answer but."
13.0,Provider,But you're willing to try anything.
9436.0,Patient,anything in this world.
13.0,Provider,"yeah yeah. So I don't know if taking a little bit more buprenorphine would take the edge off. Right, I really don't know. you've got so much breakthrough pain, are you having besides pain, are you having more other symptoms."

You tell them, this was an you give it in a number you say it started out as a one now it's a four or now it's an eight and give them specific numbers, so that they can compare it's getting worse, so there's no denying it's not subjective its objective, give them numbers okay."

If there would be any but even that would be beneficial, I like I told her I don't know if it's psychological or. If there was a jump in the like even like a milligram or two more if it would be beneficial, I don't know. And she wasn't unsure to."
13.0,Provider,"yeah she wouldn't know she doesn't know that sort of thing, but why don't we try going to 10 and just seeing. just for a few days, to see if that does make a difference if it doesn't make a difference. list back back down because there's no reason to be at the higher dose if it's not going to do you any good. and"
9436.0,Patient,You know just be mindful out loud what would it look like is. As far as i'm trying not to cry with the PVC. How long would I noticed that what would what would be a timeframe for me to notice the difference.
13.0,Provider,"Within. An hour or an hour and a half, you should have less pain and and track it, you know and tell the surgeon. My Doc had me on 8 million, you know on what was it six and move me to eight and I got a little bit of relief and then it started getting really bad again at a 10 or an eight or however you want to rate it with the number and then she tried me at 10. And, and then give give that see what relief, you get."
