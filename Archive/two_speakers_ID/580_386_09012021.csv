I have the weekly Bam seven the pH Q nine and the patient satisfaction questionnaire all completed on the 30th.

For what i'm going to be requesting is for a 12343. So what i'm going to do is i'm going to request for a three day supply with one additional refill because right now the prescription recommendation is for a four day supply with one additional Raphael, but if I give you a four day, then that puts you pass to the. Point okay that's so i'm going to request for a three day for you, so it will be for a quantity of three with one additional refill. i'm may even ask the provider if they can just get you to cover to till Monday, because you are only taking one per day, but I have to abide by the prescription recommendations."
