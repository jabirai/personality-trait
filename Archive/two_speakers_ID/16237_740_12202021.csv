And when I deal with these issues, I keep going to my family and friends and I realized that I, and I keep telling myself I can't keep going to these people, and I feel like i'm burning them with my. own mental health issues, and I feel like I need to talk to a professional. to navigate the best way to deal with these issues because, even though I said i'm good i'm good today, but I recently just. This is probably the perfect time because I recently just had an emotional roller coaster of a couple weeks dealing with. A relationship. type of problem, and it was really affecting my mental health and my emotion and right now i'm trying to like get grounded get myself i'm on the right path and try to figure out, what are the trigger that how to. change the situation, so I can stay back on to where I need to be to be healthy."

740.0,Provider,Have a school move a school like for you.
16237.0,Patient,"um core. Core was very, very weird because I moved around a lot, I never stayed at the same school longer for six months I moved around I so from like crisco all the way to like sixth grade I. Change schools. Frequently, so I did to or I went to like seven school between preschool to third grade stayed in Santa Barbara area and say that the third, fourth, fifth. And then didn't one day a sixth grade, and then I went to another school and then I stayed at that same school system from sixth grade to middle school to high school and. My time in school was I always talk with great, but I only saw a lot of the teachers and mostly it's because of native American and Mexican, and so we argue with the White teachers, when it came to like history and native American history and whatever. But you would get in trouble a lot for talking in class for cruising around but I always thought good grade, so I collect the teacher didn't really know what to do with me. they're like he gets the grades, for years, and never like it's hard in class and I was our original art and I realized later like what because I have ADHD you know the large part of it. But. I was kind of like a class clown. So a lot of people want to be in the tell jokes and the around me happy, but I also look at depressive episodes and they will get really dark and I would be alone, but everyone want to be around me when i'm smiling and laughing. And it can make a busy a lot either always. I was always cherished and open minded, so we wanted to join Every club every organization and I wanted to be involved. With the school as much as I could, so I used to be in like marching down to the phonics and. I was in the culinary arts club, I was I didn't I collect academics to catalog, which is a day off a club, and so I will go to school at seven in the morning and I would really like along like six or seven. Do all that stuff so I always try to keep myself very busy, and I carry that on and to Community college to add in want to go to college, right after it like I was ready. And I felt like if I went to a city college that would give me the same experience. I did nothing I discovered a lot more about myself during that time and I went to Community college for four years, and then I transferred from city college to uc Santa Cruz. And I did my first year and I realized I didn't have my support system and I had a little bit of a nervous breakdown, I know what it was at the time and I guess I. was still trying to unravel would have meant to have a nurse breakdown in my interpretation and what it was a different thing. And I failed my first year and the school put me on academic probation and said. You have to leave you can come back, but you need to take a break and come back the next spring of 20 2014 but I said no, I would rather. Take a year off and we just myself, so I got like a job and that's when I started to run an exercise and lose my weight and then I went back to school and but because I feel that to do another year I do. two more years and all the ways that I lost that game everything back in my mental effort. But I I was involved a lot more to school again that it did my first year at one more clubs were activities, I had to we make friends again on my friend swim in the first year or last the second year we just got on again and I was able to graduate. And do do that because a lot of teachers told me that I couldn't graduate. college told a lot from a lot of my teachers I hadn't Santa Barbara county night Oh, do you won't do that you won't be able to do it because of your of how you fidget and stuff like that we don't think you'll be able to do a vicious cycle enough to do. And so I found myself a lot in the school system. pushes that but also propelled forward and. and developing my own sense of persevering. And figuring out like. No matter how much people pushing it down. They pushed me over trying to get that guy. And it hurts. Like something. Like I have to have a push for."
740.0,Provider,"He so. One thing I was saying. Is that even when people push you down. The fall gets hard he heard some time but fact that you have the strength enough to push back and so basically perseverance has been seems as if one, the main story of your life you've been able to persevere through so many things and being able to push back. Despite having a people tried to push you down. And so. I think that's an amazing quality that you have angel I really, really do. Because of the situation that you're in and we'll talk more about it, we don't have to talk about a decision but. You know, sometimes the fight that we have gets disguised or it gets diminished. When something hurts so bad, it seems as if we don't have any fight left. However. You persevere so much and you gain so much strength. That, even though it feels. Excuse me like you have no strength to fight. You know, sometimes you just have to remember the pay is victories of you being able to try and have over so many obstacles in the midst of adversity and people people telling you know and you'll never do this and never do there. And the fact that she was able to try and build with those it lets me know that eventually you'll be able to triumph over this. So any. Any. Any financial any legal issues you're concerned about."
16237.0,Patient,"legal issues, no financial a little bit so Tom. Mostly cuz I I quit my job I used to so I had a lot of jobs and little independent makes you know, makes me wanna so I did there a little bit for the pandemic, I was working for the government for the census government and they laid off. Instead it wasn't working to the standard and I realized later because I wasn't on my medication P medications was hard for me to form, and then I run that through with a law. That allows it to many people, even if they had with conditions and my friend worked at a restaurant anything I can help you at a bar. Mitchell far job and I was desperate, so I think i'll take it, but there was really destroyed my mental health being there, and so I joined February 2020 and then I will turn up for another job and I wanted to be a substitute teacher. And I figured That would be a good health, so I was applying to do the cast and I failed like three times, and then the fourth time I pass. And I was really happy because that's, the only thing I needed to do. and I told my boss attacks on put in my two weeks and I told them, the second July of this year and. I quit my job around their first week of October. But that's when I got accepted to be assessed for right now what's holding me back, we started to work is the processing for the paperwork, I thought that people feel the process but it's a lot of other work and the last thing I have to do is. get a medical examinations, the TV and I won't connect the last one I have to do in order to start working but i'm not going to be able to my earliest, I can see me is January third. But I know one time get that exam taking care of working out people who are. mm hmm and I have rental assistance, right now, from. la county so i'll be fine in February. keeping their school and a mother bill, but I am a little worried that I will be starting to look into that and, even though I think I will, by the end of cardboard. huh yeah."
740.0,Provider,Do you have do you have a vehicle.
16237.0,Patient,"If you have a car, yes."
740.0,Provider,"Have you ever thought about uber eats so uber or lyft or Amazon flags or anything like this, like."
16237.0,Patient,"I have thought about that i'm not completely out of the restaurant job I told them I don't mind being on call for you guys need extra help. And I helped them last week, I prefer to share and they asked me like beginning of next year, can you help, like every Saturday we need extra people for the football games and stuff like that. And I said yeah i'll help you out and i'll be back on the first week of January right now in Las Vegas helping my grandmother move for house. to another house and i'm going to be here for about two and a half weeks and I said when I returned i'm more than happy to put a promotion. For the rest of the month, and they said Okay, so I have that and then I also help. My uncle has a marijuana businesses and help term was near term with them. And so that's money coming in, but it comes in every two months so it's my monthly and i'm still waiting for the money that should be a good chunk of change coming in, but I don't know when it's going to come in, but it's just the middle of next month I. don't like i'm worried, but I have. i'm not like completely like hopeless. Absolutely yeah."
740.0,Provider,"Well that's good at least you have your hands in a few little things. That are bringing income that you need. So, are you are you currently in a relationship."
16237.0,Patient,"Currently, no. Okay, I kind of was but we broke it off literally yesterday. huh yeah. and It wasn't. And it wasn't. It was very complicated, I think, for me, and her I overestimated her. And I think she underestimated me. Because. It was because she was going to have me she told me, and this is the thing that made it more confusing I realized that decision she's at my house me. I live with my partner. And she moved in and around May. And we're really good friends, but I get some tension out of the build up between that and then around November I offered she wanted to. be something more, and she said she was going to come to the same thing to me, but she kept reminding me that she has. She has a lot to say that I have a lot of Blocks when it comes to intimacy with men, and when I when you get really close to me I close up. And I have these issues, and she broke up with her boyfriend to look around July, and I would be somebody and I broke up with her around May. And so we are closer and closer and then he said look well, maybe we should be like a bunch of benefits situation, but I told her like we have to really communicate, but she didn't want to put any labels or anything, and I think there are two quotes and she got to quote. and And every time we were trying to get closer and closer she just kept walking me and. She. I didn't really understand what the issue was until like a week ago and I realized to happen in a month, she told me she had a condition called a badge and listening and I didn't know really what it was. And I. And I wish I knew that before, because I can select I could have been more accommodating and more helpful. And we kept getting more intimate because she she said, in order for me to be open with somebody to be emotionally open and I feel like open up myself so much emotionally to her and then she told me like two weeks ago, like our product feed another guy. And then she's like can I bring the guy over and I just was very, very hurt and then she kept telling me like I want to be with you on the cookies but actually i'm actually terrified. of being with you sexually I don't I feel close up to you, but with this other guy i'm feel terrified with him intimately and I don't feel closed up, and so I just felt really for Thailand. And I kept getting mixed signals from her all the time, and she was telling me how she wants me and achieve this pushing you away, and it was just like an emotional roller coaster and I kept feeling so. I kept feeling so much pushing cool. And it was really hurting me and I told my my parents, my friends, and they kept saying well she's not that emotionally mature she doesn't know what she's doing. And I talked to another friend who in relationship with her and. She said she did the exact same to her and so. I told her like well i'm going to go away for the break maybe we're not gonna we're not going to be anything like i'm not be anything we broke it off. And, actually, we need to take a break new we're hanging out too much too much to eat with each other, but then she kept saying like well, maybe companies in the future and i'm like this is really stressing me out. exactly like you don't really know what you're doing. you're only thinking about yourself. And you're not really thinking about me all you read you're just thinking about yourself under percent and i'm just being used, and so I feel like from that relationship, it will be giving so much. Money getting. knocked at the news or taking and taking and taking and I just felt like the drain. And it just hurt and then instead of being empathetic I just felt. I just saw you I just abuse the news and then. To dangle the carrot if i'm missing like maybe later future and. I can do this with you i've had these kind of issues with people that path, but you want so much and then, when you want them to get something out of it, you deny them and I just hurt so much. Until i'm here. In Vegas for the next two and a half weeks. until January 3. And i'm hoping during this time I got here yesterday, I can. Work on myself and get myself grounded again and. move past it because that really hurt and. yeah like even yesterday, she texted me to go with it okay for me right, the Bible verse to how that I said we're not anything anymore what why he tells them do whatever you want. don't tell me anything why you. And I just feel like this person doesn't know what they're doing. And I I completely overestimated their. emotional ability to understand where i'm at and where they're at and I realized the gap between us emotionally and. it's a lot bigger than I thought. yeah."
740.0,Provider,So you you wouldn't hurt to live together.
16237.0,Patient,yeah we're still housemates yeah. we've been living together since around late. Late may she moved I moved in early.
740.0,Provider,"and we'll get we'll get on it we'll talk about it moving forward, so let me ask you this angel what are some things you want to work on a while you're hearing treatment."
16237.0,Patient,"Some things I really want to work on, is my self confidence, I feel like my self confidence has really taken a hit recently I really want to get that back. I guess my jealousy I noticed that have that and that's something that I feel like I have to work hard for my envy of both of them. and I guess, I noticed that I also have a lot of repressed rage."
740.0,Provider,Okay Rachel.
16237.0,Patient,"I just noticed that. When I have usually Okay, with my anger, but. When she told me, is it a bigger guy over that tonight. With me. I didn't do anything violent I didn't scream and shout. And said I got really emotional health delays with me and I just left the apartment to go walk and, as I just walked around and walked around that feature I just felt so much anger. That too much rain outside it's been a long time to help this, and so I don't know what's coming from I don't know what it is, and it was just me not really knowing her enough. And I felt like I said on it i'm still curious about that. and I try to figure out okay. I get have more hope your. Hope yeah."
740.0,Provider,So the jealousy comes from the lack of confidence.
