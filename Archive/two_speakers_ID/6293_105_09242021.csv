6293.0,Patient,"The Monday, Tuesday, has been working again. that's the those days have been free for me. I can make sure those days stay free because. tom's getting work scheduled for us, hopefully. And i'll just know that those times are times I have to be here."
105.0,Provider,"Okay, so so maybe what we can do is we'll come up with something next week and i'm going to go ahead forward into the following where there's more flexibility, I can start to get you back into some consistent timeframe, you know um."
6293.0,Patient,"I do, like the early meetings."
105.0,Provider,"Okay yeah well that's really, all I can do anyway. yeah alright. So. My challenge is next week only because things got filled up quickly. um. What What would it be like for this one time for you and Michelle and I to meet at 110 on Wednesday."

105.0,Provider,"That Well, this is on the release. Okay um. But, but we do have the right phone number there so that's good this was wow you've been here for over a year. hmm time goes by, fast. Yes, okay well we're good. It doesn't look like there's any. Rights to it for. me. So okay we're good. So we've got a tweet. So part of what kind of works is this idea of adding some homework. i'm not really I give up on that a long time ago nobody was doing their homework."
6293.0,Patient,I understand that.
105.0,Provider,"You know. Then apparent a long time, so, but it does it does. It does something for. A demonstration to the soul of accountability and your commitment. And it can. Be evidence that you're taking yourself seriously, that your inconvenience that you're putting it as a priority it's something tangible and observable to a parent so parent asked me what are you seeing, and I can say this stuff takes effort he's doing it."
6293.0,Patient,"You know yeah I was about to say the same thing, I mean that that's evidence of. doing something. So that's fine to lean on that evidence like yesterday. Yesterday morning I woke up and I could smell somebody smoking heroin within the vicinity and so could my mom so she was a little bit up in arms about that yesterday morning, so I grabbed. One of the drug tests that I have, and I just took it and I gave it to my mom and everything was Okay, so I just wanted to have evidence to provide."
105.0,Provider,Oh i'm sorry that's. So close by.
6293.0,Patient,"We live on the South side of town it's everywhere. As we know, new Mexico is just inundated with it so."
105.0,Provider,Okay.
6293.0,Patient,Not much I can do. At least I don't live in albuquerque.
105.0,Provider,"So one thing we can do is we're going to do. um we'll do two two groups, a week. Okay that's probably have to be a bit fluid in some days only because of the individual stuff. And you know, obviously it's it's good for your mind and body to be busy working so that you know want you working that's good. down that schedule is going to be so. i'm capable of being flexible. So we'll have that and then I would like to have to I sees a week so to individual or family I don't I don't those are like the same thing. Now, I also want to add fellowship which you've either follow through with the one online or one in your community do you have one in your community that you like, and you kind of resonate with."
6293.0,Patient,"um no not yet today I kind of wanted to go to one. I was just going to make sure that it was okay with Tom and my mom, but I wanted to go to one, but today i'm really like to find. Somebody that I can go to the gym with. That is in a similar situation that. Because I don't want to be anywhere alone. Really at all. So that that was kind of something that i've been mulling over for the last few days so because I really, really need to be exercising a lot more and. I don't want to be alone, so I need to find a buddy and I need to find a. Yes. Yes, yes, yes, yes."
105.0,Provider,yeah so I have. Had that written down. So where are you going where's the room.
6293.0,Patient,I forget the name of the Church.
105.0,Provider,"I can get there, you know."
6293.0,Patient,My mom has it written them. She she has the.
105.0,Provider,"Okay, so and have you lost all of your the recovery journal, maybe you were keeping notes in before is that gone."
6293.0,Patient,"No, I have my recovery journal, that I was using I. Everything got cleaned up like extra crazy, so I don't know where I put it, but I have a new recovery tunnel that. I got with the other day."
105.0,Provider,let's put our numbers back on the front let's get them right back okay.
6293.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
105.0,Provider,"let's start with mine i'm, just in case. So you can put one cell that's 954 to 4008842 put one cell then below that you can put zoom ID. 765830613 to really label it well, if you ever need to reach out to Tom or your mom and say, can you look here they'll be able to easily see it and below that put the full word virtual clinic and then abbreviation the sea and then put 847141175. And might as well put the other one because it doesn't always open super early put forth 08 below it so you might put or you know, so it starts for Z right then 486476. And then put the H H right heart health put this is a telephone numbers, you want to label it telephone number those other two are zoom zoom numbers, this one is 844-884-4474. Okay, and then put Dr aubrey yell group zoom. that one is 96530683532. And here we go next one, and a narcotics anonymous which happens to be on zoom to it's not hosted by braveheart but here we go, so the zoom ideas."
6293.0,Patient,55854494.
105.0,Provider,uh huh yeah yeah to have those forests followed right yeah so then i'll repeat it again for you on 927 or the last numbers. So 558544927 this one does have a password this one is a password so password to 47247 so as in 24 seven so you might want to make that a big highlighted thing it's open 24 seven. We don't have any excuse to not drop in at any time. We feel alone we feel hopeless any of it just go in there don't overthink it just login. You don't know what you're going to hear sometimes people come out of there and there's this great speech that's shared. Somebody really you know you get out of your own like oh i'm all alone i'm the only one suffering you hear hope and strength from someone else's story don't know that you get a sponsor out of that but I guess maybe because.
6293.0,Patient,I know I need to go I.
105.0,Provider,"yeah I actually want to add one more number, just so you have it in case you ever want to use the SMS number to check in so put SMS check in it's 415458 to 688 and that that's a text right obviously that's. Okay, I think we got our numbers covered. So. Normally, what I do right around this time is, I have a a behavior contract that i've used. i'll try it without see what happens. there's going to be. A few i'm writing some things down so things that will go increase our groups individual therapy fellowship exercise like you said getting a sponsor and the ways will be more frequent."
6293.0,Patient,Okay cool.
105.0,Provider,"Now, unfortunately. I had, and I know from bright heart that they're not gonna be able to send more cups. So they're probably going to be a random request for you to go into the lab. So when that referral comes through it's probably going to maybe be through an email maybe from used to be Angelina now I think of a jarrod and Pablo or something anyway they'll be referrals for that."
6293.0,Patient,"Okay, is there any way that. Both me and my mom can be alerted of that."
105.0,Provider,You see if I can. I don't do this so.
6293.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
105.0,Provider,"yeah makes sense. All right. And then there's homework. And there's also i've been watching, I have some people that take anti abuse i'm not saying it's for you, but what they do the. really helping them is they're sending me videos of when they're taking it. So I found it interesting that your second relapse at least followed a couple days of you're not taking buprenorphine. don't know how that happened how the mind somehow."
6293.0,Patient,He had the four day refills kind of thing gone so. Before I went to refill I just let a couple days go by. And that was not really intentional.
105.0,Provider,"If you think about how powerful the mind is this, this is so, if I say, do you really know what a reservation is. Of a relapse or reservation, we do it, we do it. Really slick, and they can take a year or more, we can start setting up for something way in advance. Slow slowly start pulling back starting to be less accountable there's just these little changes that make it possible lot easier."
6293.0,Patient,"yeah leading up to that. All of my behavior has just been a brother nonchalant with both. Keeping my meetings up and doing all of those things so everything was kind of. Not as structured, as I needed to be and. I think that's kind of what led to me being like. Just lackadaisical about it."
105.0,Provider,"You see how slippery That is because that's what felt the time you felt confident. And I I watched that all day long. It will work for me to say you look really confident you need to keep seeing me, you need to keep showing up i'm not i'm not in. i'm not that therapist I just i'm not guys are going to have to figure it out on your own."
6293.0,Patient,"yeah absolutely that's that's 90% of the whole thing is doing it ourselves, because I mean we have what to plan an hour two hours with you a week so. yeah."
105.0,Provider,"But what we have is something really good you have tangible evidence you've had this this relapse and now, when we go back to the relapse prevention plan. You can see your own sort of voice coming back at you, and you can call bullshit you know it can call you out, it can say, and so that's why it's Nice. And i'm going to open it up now, where you can talk and then you're going to hear that voice at you so it's not coming from me, and I can say well okay. you're pulling back. You feel so good at work, you feel so optimistic you're irritated with your mother, because she has self doubt sounds familiar. it's a little soon it's this it's both it's we get to celebrate every day right that we have sobriety. But we need to be aware that our reward system is broken it's. You broke it you didn't mean to you didn't know you're looking for a good time looking for a high all kinds of different reasons why people do it. But broke. it's gotten. got ahead take time for it to heal and the healing is new. synaptic connections with i'm bored, this is what I did and luckily, this is what I do disappointed. Instead of board lonely drug. Now, it needs to take. More meditation board. emailed someone whatever. you've got to have that experience. can't just talk about it."
6293.0,Patient,"um last night I did have a dream about using. I did end up eventually saying no in my dream which was. yeah. That was a new one for me, because all of the other dream is that i've had one hours or using it, I actually used but. I very distinctly remember the dream, because it was. One of those ones where I have kind of a hard time distinguishing between reality and the dream itself and. yeah I said now."
105.0,Provider,that's pretty cool.
6293.0,Patient,yeah I think the whole fear thing is working. cuz. I really don't want to die.
105.0,Provider,"What do you want to do. What do I do with your life we want, where is the meaning in your life. Because you said it was middle said it was my mom but remember that stuff never even came to your mind."
6293.0,Patient,"i'm just trying to break that down into something simple lately then. Live basically, is what I the answer that I came up with because one it's simple to there is so much to living and three it's. much, much more interesting than. Nothing. Because that's all I remember from dying was just nothing."
105.0,Provider,Okay okay so there's some some recollection of that.
6293.0,Patient,yeah boy. koval. Know like you know grandma at the end of the tunnel no nothing just floyd.
105.0,Provider,"can ask you a little bit I know i'm jumping around a little bit, but I want to know a little bit about the way you eat, can you tell me a little bit about how what kind of what your basic diet looks like."
6293.0,Patient,"shitty um. yeah it's not great. I mean it's, not that I don't eat a bunch of junk food I eat fruit I eat vegetables, I eat healthy it's just the increments and timing is not where it needs to be. Like at home, we have, maybe like one meal a day that we cook and as a full sized like meal and that's dinner. For breakfast it's usually like cereal and fruit and lunch is kind of up in the air, most days. My adderall does kind of affect my appetite a little bit, which is unfortunate, but I do still force myself to eat well not really force myself, I know that I need to eat, and I just go and. Normally I eat a lot of food normally i'm always hungry. And I also want to be eating more because I want to gain weight and. yeah so my eating habits need to become more structured and I need to really be starting to cook for myself. Because. My mom. has a very particular diet that she can eat and really can't eat anything else so both Tom and I have to. Give into her diet and eat her diet versus our own like I normally would. be eating a lot of rice and chicken and vegetables for meals that's really. What nourishes me. The best. yeah I just need to be cooking for myself."
105.0,Provider,"And how many meals, do you know how to make you feel like."
6293.0,Patient,"I. went to college for hotel restaurant tourism management so cooking I mean I did in high school, I went to the Community college for Asian cooking Italian Mexican. And like a fusion in class. And then I also went to Italy and I went to school in Italy at a peaches in Florence for summer in between. Laughter sophomore year, so I was 19. That was awesome find a lot, I did cooking. Food history and wine, those are my three classes, that I did there and yeah so yeah cooking is something that i'm very good at."
105.0,Provider,And what may not be there is a commitment to do it on. A particular day or two or three of the week.
6293.0,Patient,"And I right. No one's relying well. I enjoy a meal planning that's what i've usually done before, is cook one day for the rest of the week, and just have that easy quick meals throw it in the microwave ready to go okay."
105.0,Provider,"Which day, do you tend to make that meal for the week."
6293.0,Patient,Sunday was my day when I did that.
105.0,Provider,Have you been doing that.
6293.0,Patient,Tommy doesn't really like me cooking.
105.0,Provider,that's tough shit.
6293.0,Patient,yeah I know.
105.0,Provider,"shelter and food and it's just. A, but I do care so How does that show up he doesn't like it, but."
6293.0,Patient,"How does that child it's it's just that. he likes to clean kitchen and. Sometimes i'm not perfect at doing the dishes right away so that's just one thing that I need to work on, well, I have been working on and i've been doing the dishes a lot so it's not. That big. I just need to get my own. Food and spices because."
105.0,Provider,"Okay shopping. yeah okay so let's get this. homework together first let's have this first homework stuff. As you get paper, etc, how you sort of organize this is. you've got shopping and. Are there so few items that right in front of you, you could list those items, or is it going to be your that your task is first to create a shopping list."
6293.0,Patient,I definitely know what I need i'm. i'm pretty particular in.
105.0,Provider,The ingredient.
6293.0,Patient,That I.
105.0,Provider,Am things or five things i'm.
6293.0,Patient,Definitely like. 30 things.
105.0,Provider,"Okay that's a lot. Your memories not perfect, I know you make the list. So why don't we start number one right shopping list, I know you say you know, but when you get in the aisle it's it's a little different So what if we say the first."
6293.0,Patient,"is troubling lists are absolutely necessary, because if I go shopping and I don't have one i'm screwed."
105.0,Provider,"Right shopping list we've got that one. Number two this really isn't in any particular order Maybe you can reorganize that but you need to. You know, get the address the name and write down this church and so that you know where the fellowship Roman is you know where it is again, these are demonstrations of. You being accountable yes. i'm a talk with your mother about meeting with us on to write that down September 29 at 110. Mountain standard time. and This is going to be this is going to be an assignment that may take you a year, this one and that's fine, but what I want you to do is so write this down it's going to be goodbye letter to so it's going to be a goodbye letter to your drug. And for many people, because we're just getting going on this right, well, it would have happened. kind of we were clipping along that this would have been a natural when I often do this when people are feeling pretty solid in their recovery. But what you will probably find, as you begin dear. I don't care what you call it, but I want you to be thinking of it in the same relational parts. yeah. Yes, and that's why this letter fits very well with it."
6293.0,Patient,I like this idea I like it a lot.
105.0,Provider,"yeah and I was going to come up and if it doesn't you're not doing it right. Right, this is just should be. excruciating Lee difficult. And you're not gonna want to write this."
6293.0,Patient,yeah I know that.
105.0,Provider,"It is a toxic relationship and just it doesn't mean. That part is dead, it means it'll always be a choice. But. To not an option it's always a choice for us to take our own life, we can do whatever we want to we have this choice, not an option. It has to be a no go and how do we get there, how do you get so sure you have this convenience of having had this death moment right. This overdose and and that might mean that you might be ready, that that the argument back. To to this firefighter part, the one that said I don't care if I kill your body i'm going to get you out of boredom I don't care i'm gonna I don't like killing the body I just don't want you to feel alone. Oh. I mean right that's what's happening."
6293.0,Patient,yeah.
105.0,Provider,"It does not check in with any other part it doesn't say, well, what about. Friendship children relationships love family it doesn't check in. So. What i'd like you to do is to. start a good by letter and I don't know what you're going to call it once you think about it, right now, for how would you address your substance use drugs heroin Sentinel pills I don't care what you call it, but what do we label this toxic relationship."
6293.0,Patient,Does just exactly that that toxic relationship.
105.0,Provider,"So you're going to be writing it so think about how you would address. Someone you might because it's going to start with deer. And deer who. who's going to be addressed to. heroin there you go then that's it it's dear heroin so. To put that on your list of things to do, but it's to start it it's to start the goodbye letter to heroin and we start with dear heroin. and put a little bullet points, because this is this is some of the things that it needs to cover and you can get as far or as little. I don't care how far little or as much that does is it, I just want you to watch and see what happens what comes up so it's going to be your bullet points are going to be Thank you. you're going to write writing what you're grateful to it for. And then moving into the damage that it's done to the different domains of your life, health. spirituality. relationships. location, education, it does just keep going Okay, you want to be able to talk about those things, and as you're. Just make sure your you include your emotions towards it, you know, like. Whatever they are your you know how you feel toward it. It it can have all of it can be. gratitude, but this that it's not like this is a pass fail it's going to be critiqued for grammar punctuation. This is about you know, right in the middle of it you've caught some truth that you thought when you were starting, it was this then. period wait a minute i'm bullshitting myself right now I need to do this with you i'm keeping an open door right now I can feel it there's still some hope that this romance will continue, you know that kind of stuff when it comes up just keep writing. Keep writing levels of honesty into it okay. So i'll be looking for that. Now the you're taking the strips the okay. Are you missing days now is your mom watching you take it. And they keep track. Okay, so that's. You know you guys are smarter than me and immediately, I thought of ways to get around that I mean it's just like Come on, if you want to get around it, you could get around it, but. What is kind of neat about the videos and so, for now we're going to go with this does your mother's taking on this this responsibility right so we'll go with that for a while and see and see what happens."
6293.0,Patient,"I definitely need self accountability for sure, but. Having having. Aid with that isn't necessarily a bad thing. For now, at least."
105.0,Provider,"When are you getting. A well I don't even I don't even know if there's limitations with this particular messaging system that you have. Is the are you have video capability. Are you able to do that we needed to okay. yeah okay. All right, let's talk about exercise for a second um. i've heard you share that you can get very extreme a bit compulsive with you know the the exercise the same way, you can with with hats and cooking and you have the capability of getting sort of myopic. What are you looking for I know you said it buddy workout buddy we can explore some some ideas about how to get that done, but how what kind of exercises are you looking to do, how frequently how many hours, what are you looking to do."
6293.0,Patient,"um I definitely. I mean i'd like to get back to. At least close to what I was used to which was. An hour to two hours almost every single day. But that is a little bit excessive. um. So i'd like to start with, like two or three days an hour a day."
105.0,Provider,let's do that let's do one hour. And are you exercising at all currently.
6293.0,Patient,"yeah yeah I do bodyweight exercises at home, I have a couple small dumbbells that I use."
105.0,Provider,"Okay, and any running."
6293.0,Patient,"No, I haven't really been going. outside. Okay around. Much just because."
105.0,Provider,You know it around.
6293.0,Patient,"The temptation yeah that there I did. there's suboxone strip the litter everywhere there's foiled straws just around my neighborhood so yeah I just don't really want to. Be around it whatsoever. Right now, at least."
105.0,Provider,paint pain that all that.
6293.0,Patient,it's not fun.
105.0,Provider,it's not making it easy.
6293.0,Patient,"waking up yesterday to the smell of heroin was really not fun. That was really, really, really not fun."
105.0,Provider,"What is, what are your mom and Tom saying about that how it's right outside your door, I mean."
6293.0,Patient,"They don't like it, they like it less than I do so um yeah."
105.0,Provider,People you guys trying to move maybe are not an option.
6293.0,Patient,Of know we're stuck in this House for two years year and a half.
105.0,Provider,"Okay, all right."
6293.0,Patient,"yeah just seems like, no matter where I go in Santa fe, no matter what there's always something. Okay."
105.0,Provider,"So there's. Also, for your list that's in front of you. know what I would like, is that you at least drop in on one of these online meetings, because there's it can be any time and just do. Even a three sentence summary of your experience of it, it doesn't have to be long but just a summary of your experience, I felt this when I heard this I felt this there's no right or wrong, but i'd like to see that. Okay, so read to me what you have, and maybe even adding what else you've committed to doing today on there, what, what do you have on their."
6293.0,Patient,shopping list turn a get any location have it said i'm. meeting with mom on the 29th goodbye letter. start the letter list on what to do. And then the online meeting.
105.0,Provider,"And what have you committed to with anyone else or yourself, but there are other things, this is you just have written what you and I talked about was there anything else you've committed to anything before around the House and chores."
6293.0,Patient,"i'm. With my sister. Miss daly she took me to target the other day, and we got a whole bunch of organizing stuff she got me this journal. bunch of sticky notes, because I had run out. Calendar that you can ride in a race on so that's one thing that i'm trying to utilize I had today's meeting on it and i'm going to have the rest of this stuff on. It i'm trying to. actually get. A sequence of events for every single day that I need to do in line and do it versus just waking up and kind of doing whatever."
105.0,Provider,yeah and a lot of people do work well in blocks like that so.
6293.0,Patient,"I know for a fact that I work much better in sequential things that need to happen, other than just kind of just doing whatever because, if I just do whatever nothing is really going to happen that I need to happen as quickly as it needs to happen."
105.0,Provider,"Okay, so i'm going to come back to structure in the calendar, but I want to make sure before we run out of time that we have more appointments on here so real clear, so when you go do your calendar, because I saw update calendar. Because, you have the ability to do that now. Yes, Sunday, you know working out with Tom good time to to do the cooking you know, like it's going to start to get filled in here so you're let's let's look forward a little bit so for next week. I nice spread, if you will, is i've noticed on Mondays I have. On my Monday 1pm until you get a job right or whatever, could you write this down it's 10 to 1pm group. Because now you've got that because I know Mondays and Tuesdays are good for you, so now we've got Monday group that will just going to cover next week, for now, so when you feel it."

To 12pm. And then you're going to be 110 on the 29th, then you have. I don't have anything open for Thursday and Friday at this point. group, which is a convenient because I mean I I think you need you need more. But you can attend another group I mean that's that's the thing so i'm where I can check in and say. You know, stay after and if you're open to it, I can ask you have you done these things, if not, then, because I don't bring things up from in here into groups, so what anyway, so you have a choice you can go Thursday at 11 or Friday at 11 What would you prefer."
6293.0,Patient,Friday at 11.
105.0,Provider,"OK, so those things can be sort of written in all right for next."
6293.0,Patient,meeting on Monday that you'd be an individual meeting on Monday.
105.0,Provider,"No, I could meet it I could meet early at seven you didn't make it at eight last Monday, so I got a little freaked out by it, but you did make it on a."
6293.0,Patient,Friday.

6293.0,Patient,A phone thing don't have a new iPad there's not gonna be any issues with so let's.
105.0,Provider,"let's do. 7am. On September 27 now you've got 123 nights for appointments where you're going to have contact with me. Okay um. And so now let's go into this, so one of the first things you may want to do is right is to update this calendar, you have a dry erase board is that what you're going to use to organize your day. Your week rather."
6293.0,Patient,"Okay, my yeah my weekend month is for the calendar day i'm using sticky sticky notes on my mirror."
105.0,Provider,"Okay, so I also, so this is really about you've got this stuff in front of you, and now you go fill in the stickies and calendar that's really that's why we did this just now, so I also have. My mantra something that you can go to you may already be using one. What do you what what are you saying to you what are you saying what's your self talk."
6293.0,Patient,um. don't Fuck up.
105.0,Provider,bar.
6293.0,Patient,"Jeremiah I know I know, but it was it's the one that i've been using for the last few days, I read wrote it on the top of my hand it on my meter. Okay. It just means basically. To not stay in a negative state of mind and to remind myself that it's for more than just me that i'm doing this and and also very, very much so, for me, because I want to live um."
105.0,Provider,"Can you add I don't I hear what you're saying that this has all of these things, but what you write on."
6293.0,Patient,I think it should be more positive.
105.0,Provider,"Yes, I do too. I do too, so it did make me remember that it would be nice to change the brain chemistry by soon, and you may want to write this on your daily routine and this one being as soon as you hit the consciousness that you set up some meditative practice so. For a lot of people, it really is that that breath work with soon as consciousness hits you do five rounds, however many rounds of breath work. And then you run through force yourself to do 10 things that you're grateful for and hold on to it get your butt out of bed and go do do do and just keep running it through so adding that daily of. Whether it is the meditation whether you know I don't know you want to get up and do a kata or you want to do some she calm, or I don't care what it is."
6293.0,Patient,I have been. my usual ritual when I would get up before I was an addict I would turn on music and meditate for a good while and i've been doing that in the mornings.
105.0,Provider,"So write that down, though, so what I over and over today, you said structure structure structure yeah so get that in there. So we've got we've got music, but this gratitude thing is very specific what that does to the brain when you're focusing on the positive stuff is just brilliant okay so get that that piece in there."
6293.0,Patient,"i've also been using. Being dead as a hard stop for my past life and the thoughts that I had in it, so when they come up. yeah like that's that's then that's then that's not anymore that's that's the hard stop and that has been. Huge for me. it's been a very heavy combat and for. Those those feelings and. i'd like to turn it into a little bit more positive of a thing, instead of being like that's that's that was that thing it's just like Okay, I have those feelings they're okay they're from my past they can stay there i'm better now."
105.0,Provider,"Well, that that'll probably evolved."
6293.0,Patient,yeah yeah. it's a new.
105.0,Provider,"thing, what if i'm on. Your hand where we write it. What if you went and stayed with. The what would love to what, if you went with that, instead of some of this don't Fuck up."
6293.0,Patient,"Yes, yes. I like that I did want to discuss that with you because I wanted to come up with something a little bit more positive um. That was. Good yeah I need to be thinking up a. Positive inflections on how I talk to myself versus just being a Dick to things that I don't like about myself because that's not the best way to go about it."
105.0,Provider,"So if you put that get a sharpie put that on on the back your hand if this is the filter with which every it's a shelter right with which every decision is made, what would love to get organized. Because I know I perform better with structure, it would be the loving thing to do, like go do it. talking to Tom about food or going ahead and risking maybe it'll be about risking going ahead and cooking what would love to. Again, it includes you it's importantly it's not just being generous to someone else it's just let that be the filter today. And just be an observer, about how that goes, you can share that with other people, you can empower them to remind you of it looks like you're you're. Not doing that kind of thing you can say why I like hearing this it's really helping me in my decision making process, because I can tell you. there's no way. For you, to reach for that hill if that filter was working."
6293.0,Patient,One thing that I did want to dimension. After my last relapse. I haven't heard myself since then. One thing that I did do was when I used. i'd feel. disgusted by it and i'd end up hurting myself and. that's just something that I did.
105.0,Provider,"Tell me about the the for itself, can you be are we talking about self injury to the skin."
6293.0,Patient,yeah yeah.
105.0,Provider,"What were you doing, because this is a little new for me."
6293.0,Patient,So tell me yeah i'm i've never really actually spoken about it with anybody so it's been kind of a hard thing to talk about but um yeah I i'd cut myself.
105.0,Provider,"Okay, so where."
6293.0,Patient,Children shoulders chest. there's not really very many scars because can. Just do it. yeah.
105.0,Provider,"So i'm and i'm really glad you told me, because that is progress that is a dramatic part and you didn't do that i'm also noticing. Each time you've been in group, and each time you're meeting with me there is you don't seem as I got to tell you shane activated really don't it's interesting. You don't look like it is that how it feels like you really get it."
6293.0,Patient,yeah.
105.0,Provider,"Okay yeah it looks like that too i'm glad you brought it up and you're not the only one, I have clients that. Have those parts right that doesn't surprise you, I mean I talk about suicide, why can I talk about a part that that wants to bring relief and have it be in a targeted. localized way that suffering gets localized right here, you know, instead of this nebulous misery, we can put it in a place, and you know there's real like logic to why that parts like this will work, this will work but i'm really proud of you that you didn't."
6293.0,Patient,Thank you.
105.0,Provider,"And you can talk about it freely, if you want to because it doesn't it doesn't scare me I don't see it as the same as suicide so i'm some people do. I have to be very careful, because you can really hurt yourself, so we kind of you know and but has there been suicidal ideation I know we're right at the end here, but I just want to check in and see."
6293.0,Patient,A little bit um.
105.0,Provider,When like when was the most recent bought.
6293.0,Patient,Last night. um. there's just someone inside me that just likes to say Fuck you shoot yourself in the face. And he doesn't like to go away.
105.0,Provider,shoot yourself in the face and remind me there's no guns in and.
6293.0,Patient,"play, not that I have access to."
105.0,Provider,Their law Tom it hasn't been walked right. Okay. let's make sure that is transcribed there's. I think we've gone over that part of. The end it is locked okay um. Now part that definitely would be one we're going to have to have a better understanding and reassure that part that you. you've got other managers that are handling what's going on here.
6293.0,Patient,he's been there for a really long time so. yeah it's one of the harder ones to be like dude calm down. You don't need to do that. But. yeah i've been able to calm him down a lot quicker than I used to be able to. used to be. he'd be there all day. Just poking at me and. Now it's maybe. 10 minutes okay.
105.0,Provider,"Most and just so that we can get this on the record, you can hear yourself say it, what are the reasons you would not shoot yourself in the face."
6293.0,Patient,"I love living, I want to be alive for a really long time. Ship shit. I don't want to let my family down. I don't want to let my dog down. To just be really selfish. Nothing is not better than all of this."
105.0,Provider,"let's get to get net calendar going you've got quite a bit to do today. and They consider this list that's in front of you figuring out. The food preparation. and putting in there some block of time for whether it's you know, a creative effort artistic beadwork or something."
6293.0,Patient,"I do beat my Bead work all day every day that's what i've been doing for the last. Since this has happened is just been doing and and before that, as well i've been working on beadwork i've turned out. Six hat bands and 14 bracelets in the last week. that's a lot."
105.0,Provider,So i'm going to check in on you. and just give you a little heads up yeah i'm doing well i'm doing okay or today sucks something okay. there's lots to do and but get just know that your particular kind of brain would do well with blocks of time don't forget about the tomato timer you're not real good at knowing about what time feels like I don't think unless you've improved on that so remember the tomato timer okay.
6293.0,Patient,"i'm. Time has gotten. A little bit more difficult for me than it used to be. Which is a little bit stressful but that's why i'm really trying to emphasize this scheduling to get I used to have perfect timing on everything always i'd always be on time. I just had perfect timing and. Now, not so much."
105.0,Provider,"yeah well it the the not feeling what what time is when it's interesting you do right, you know you think you do. So great, but as I think we've talked about this before and so put it in blocks, I know you're saying you're doing before but put it in a chunk of time."
6293.0,Patient,"Yes, yes."
105.0,Provider,"Oh, I need to get up you don't overanalyze you get up and then you go much and you to prepare this. and Leave it better than the way you founded is a good way to walk out of a kitchen after you do something. Good walk out of a bathroom full the towel it's it's just it's this different way leave it better than that. It feel good."
6293.0,Patient,"Yes, it's also kind of like. don't put it down put it away."
105.0,Provider,that's Nice.
6293.0,Patient,That for me i'm.
