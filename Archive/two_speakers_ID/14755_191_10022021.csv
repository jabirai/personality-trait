14755.0,Patient,Good how are you.
191.0,Provider,Doing pretty good. i'm pretty good. I know we had started a different medicine for you the amitriptyline so I kind of want to start there. how's that working for you.
14755.0,Patient,i've only used it two nights so far. it's done pretty good. Actually really good honestly I feel like it's helped me stay asleep better like I don't know it's not like a with the trousers don't I still felt really groggy in the morning. And with the benadryl I would wake up they're not halfway through the night feeling almost restless and this so far has done pretty well.
191.0,Provider,wow and you know it's interesting everybody's body chemistry so different so with so you've only used it tonight so we'll get a better idea of how it works and how many amitriptyline are you requiring to get you to sleep at night.
14755.0,Patient,Just one.
191.0,Provider,Just one on.
14755.0,Patient,One about like an hour and a half before bed is done. really well just lay down and relax for a little while and.
191.0,Provider,"We like. We like that. Okay, so let me pull this up to so we're going to focus on, are we going to follow up on a couple of things all right all right. Now right, so the 25 milligrams works pretty good for you. Okay, are you getting at least seven or eight hours of sleep on this medicine. yeah okay yeah."
14755.0,Patient,"awesome I mean it's been a super long week so that might. factor into it a little bit, but so far it's it's felt like it's doing well."
191.0,Provider,"Okay, Dan so sick and how do you feel when you wake up."
14755.0,Patient,"And really refresh like a like I said, with the trash done, I was still really groggy when I woke up, and it would take me a couple couple hours to really get moving, but this is good."
191.0,Provider,"Okay that's good that's really good, are you noticing dry mouth anything like that okay all right so just just a couple of things to always want to forewarn on that because i've had people start. Many of these medicines that have this anti Carl. colon allergic peace and some year anti histamines can do that. Over time, if you get have less alarming your mouth you're going to increase your risk of having more back to your growth, more cavities. So what I always tell people anytime you start these types of masks as a gargle before you go to be Ambrose really good don't eat anything else because you don't want, two years later, look and be like okay now you know health of my teeth are not there okay. Right okay so let's just just go ahead and just step up that or hygiene, just as a preventive okay. You know, watch your weight Okay, this is a low dose so a lot of the negative side effects, you may not see it as much. As a watch away. let's see anything else with it it's causing any mood changes I know it's only two days, but any negative side effects."
14755.0,Patient,Nothing that i've noticed so far.
191.0,Provider,"Alright, so the thing I like about this medicine. Is that one it's also beneficial for depression. Right okay to it's beneficial for pain all right now we start, and it can help you sleep, we started a really low dose. And so, if you're. able to tolerate a higher dose to deal with other concerns like depression or pain, then we'll revisit that let's just see how you doing a lower dose okay."
14755.0,Patient,sounds good.
191.0,Provider,"Okay, Dan so good for depression and pain. All right, and so we're going to kind of i'm going to shift a little bit. The other thing too when you start sleeping at night that also helps with anxiety depression helps with pain, too. Definitely yeah any changes with that since you've gotten have you gotten to good night's sleep."
14755.0,Patient,"yeah I feel good right now, like I woke up this morning. I knew I had this meeting that I went for a little walk before and i'm still out here right now but. yeah I feel pretty good I feel like I have a lot more well, at least for the last two days I felt like I had a lot more like energy throughout the day. and definitely less irritable."
191.0,Provider,"More energy and less irritable okay and that's usually what you can have here when people start sleeping it's amazing once you can get a person to to improve the quality of sleep even your focus. People say the novices better. Their performance is better so let's see how that works for you okay. Right so we'll get that going. And we'll go here. Right, so you do understand what this medicine, once you get used to it and you've been taking it for like two or three weeks it's not something you want to come off. instantly Okay, if you need to come off, we have to come off slowly because you'll start to notice that you may. actually start having flu like symptoms, or you notice that you're not functioning as well without it Okay, if you ever get to a point that you need to come down, they will have to come down really slowly alright. So we've got that taken care of there. Just to confirm here, how are you doing with a camper say."
14755.0,Patient,goodbye i've been taking it three times a day. i'm not 100% positive but i'm pretty sure it's making me a little gas you. it's not really into the world though just. Okay little uncomfortable like.
191.0,Provider,"And that's often with stomach cancer, maybe a concern there Okay, can I guess see all right um have you noticed anything different in terms of craving for alcohol anything like that."
14755.0,Patient,"I mean. No, I haven't really been at all. I wasn't really very much before either, but. pretty much the same. I mean no cravings yeah. I went on it as soon as like it. was still kind of in shock, so I don't know, maybe, maybe it's continually helps me keep this mindset."
191.0,Provider,"Okay yeah for some people, we do notice that it's beneficial and The thing is, we have you on a low dose because we wanted to check your labs too so we're going to definitely look at okay we're going to look at that. Any soda the guessing this as a negative side effect is one of the things will be be careful with certain triggers for gas and it's like beings protein, a lot of protein bars protein mixes you start getting what is above 30 grams of protein it really gassy. So just just be aware of the other things that may be contributing okay. All right, then so we'll keep doing that Where are you now with the alcohol use any alcohol was the last I call him take."
14755.0,Patient,The sort of been the 20th of August.

191.0,Provider,"Okay, with me, and let me know and group, because I usually do a B complex. Okay, all right, and what I can do is I can send you an A, B complex and we need to do us like a side by side comparison okay. So you need to have that them and you need to have the folic acid, you need to have to be 12 okay. A lot of times, if you just get be 12 is kind of weird to have different formulations Okay, but at least want those three in there okay alright, so let me i'm going to discontinue to be 12 and put in a B complex okay. I should take I like to do a B complex so just because. it's kind of get a little bit more diverse options of."
14755.0,Patient,So is that something that they're going to give me as a prescription at the pharmacy or is that something that should just go by myself.

14755.0,Patient,sounds good alright.
191.0,Provider,"So we got that taken care of. All right, then, and i'm gonna look back here at the know here, I know we've got a couple of documents want to always look at the pH Q nine looking at things it depression, and so this one was on glucose the end of Sep tember your last one that you took. So. We look at pH Q ny. Look at high even film in several days that's looking at depression depression scores and 11 so that's a moderate depression, do you agree with that."
14755.0,Patient,"No i'd say it's more mild honestly. And I wouldn't say it's even like consistent at this point in time, like I don't always feel like. Okay, you know but. You know there's sometimes when. I get really in my head about my situation right now is everything and it kind of ends up being hard to bounce back from that until after I go to sleep and wake up okay."
191.0,Provider,sounds like sleep is very restorative for you in terms of healing on multiple levels.
14755.0,Patient,mm hmm.
191.0,Provider,"let's see you need to sleep. Okay, and also for you get seven in terms of anxiety is a moderate do you how do you feel about that."
14755.0,Patient,"i'd say that's that's fair okay that's fair all right, Dan."
191.0,Provider,"Alright, so let's see how would you say you've been doing let's see if we look at where you are now so i'm going to look back here at your other gets seven also and just kind of let's go back to September 16 two weeks ago and see if there was any change. yeah two weeks ago, if we look at. Back on. 2012 when I say two weeks before you, you your pH Q now was a 13. and your get seven was in your anxiety, was it 30 so mid September you scored higher with depression and you scored higher with anxiety. You know what was going on let's say about two weeks ago, two, three weeks ago."
14755.0,Patient,"I mean, I was still. Working working through all the stuff that I have going on right now, you know with. Like court and work and all that stuff. I feel a little bit better about the situation now, nothing has really change okay."
191.0,Provider,And what that kind of gives me hope and do you agree with both these assessments.
14755.0,Patient,Three weeks ago yeah.
191.0,Provider,"Because one of the reasons I like to look at the pre and the post, like the lease you know, and you always be. You know you're very straightforward appreciate it so it's good to have something kind of objective to see how we're feeling and not just, and so what I see is that it looks like you're getting a little better. You fill in a little better. Best positive at least the scores and nine going up. You know, do go up I like for the therapy to go up and us to kind of look at what we need to do so, these are good Marcus. accounted for us to kind of gauge, where we are now the a camper say for some people, that may be beneficial for some people with anxiety. Okay, and so I know when you and I talked We said we were going to just kind of take things one day at a time see how you feel when. We got to sleep and, as noted for the last two days Okay, so that could be a positive we've got you on the gate camper say not drinking that's a positive okay. A couple of things, but guy here going back on your note here. Right up and. Right now, you were and i'm going strictly from memory. You were on trezza don't in the past that you are also on another medicine to help with anxiety and it passes, if my memory serves me correctly."
14755.0,Patient,yeah I was on wellbutrin.
191.0,Provider,And how did that work what for you.
14755.0,Patient,"It works like it did its job, but it also kind of made me feel. Like a little sound out."
191.0,Provider,"Okay, to either these medicines make you feel that way. Alright okay alright so we'll keep moving just keep that in the back of our mind I think what we're doing now you're moving in the right direction. The way I usually work with my patients is that i'd like to make little steps as long as you're moving in the right direction, because with each Madison there's a pro and a con as a positive and. A negative. And I don't like to add all of them at one time and. let's look at your labs because one of the things that like to do is see if we can get your a camper save up to the recommended dose okay see if that gives you some benefits all right so we've got a urine drug spring. uds on 930 2021 okay all negative that looks good okay. yeah i'm all negative is great. Then let's go over your labs looks like your lab results to hear you all those."
14755.0,Patient,"yeah I took a look at those I think my calcium was and my Korean inside my Korea, and it has always been kind of high."
191.0,Provider,"yeah. it's your blood pressure, high."
14755.0,Patient,"I actually have not checked my blood pressure in a long time, I honestly should I know my dad has problems with hypertension Okay, and I believe is both actually I know my mom like paternal grandparents and maternal grandparents both had the issue as well, so. Okay, actually definitely need to be on top of that, I just don't have like a blood pressure checker."
191.0,Provider,Do you have a primary care provider.
14755.0,Patient,"I do not. Yes, I just have transportation issues, someone has to look for someone near my house."
191.0,Provider,"yeah so what I want you to do is call them Okay, and I want you to get. A primary care doctor, because we need to look at you're creating and why's it elevated. We your your sodium and see your calcium is just slightly all the way it's only 9.1 Okay, but calcium, is one of those things you definitely want to keep an eye on and electrolytes can be off when kidneys are not working optimally okay so. Your glow mariela filtration rate still looks good okay so it's not affected that right now, if you go to place, you know how they can monitor your blood pressure, can you just sit down and put your man and. Sometimes, like if you're near a walmart. Saying any of those okay. Okay, so you do need a primary care Doc to address labs check blood pressure okay. So we. So that's one of the main things we want to do we want to get that check, we want to keep that repeated, we want to make certain because let's say if. let's just say it's you know there's any type of concern about you kidneys okay well if there's any type of concern there medicines, you can put a person on and diets you can recommend that's going to be Reno protective okay. yeah and is this the only that that looks like that's, the only thing we got from you, but."
14755.0,Patient,"yeah I think that's the only ones you guys request, they just when I went they just took some blood from me and that's. Just a complete metabolic."
191.0,Provider,know that was HIV and all other kinds of things that were done requested yeah they they just did one thing CDC because if there's concern about kidneys you always want to check a CBC to check your blood level.
14755.0,Patient,Right yeah.
191.0,Provider,"yeah, so we need all lab results i'm going to request them okay."
14755.0,Patient,"Okay yeah I actually sent them an email, while ago requesting everything because it had been almost a month from the time that I got it taken to even when I got that complete metabolic profile back from them, I didn't know that they did all the other stuff as well."
191.0,Provider,"yeah but they all know we all get back uh yeah just your kidney function and stuff yeah. I have partial results. So please request results. Patient. or a patient. Alright, so. So, have already requested that so let's make certain that comes back to us okay."
14755.0,Patient,So I don't need to go there again now.
191.0,Provider,"You should. Because this happened before we're by. person goes God is blood drawn, but then they only send us a portion of the layers and all of it didn't come through okay so yeah we need all your results. yeah let's go back here and yeah because they should check your I like your beat 12 level check the folic acid level all of that should be checked because part anytime you you drinking alcohol, you always want to. Do P 12 folic acid. All of that. yeah yeah, so we need all of that mean, even if they just. yeah let me go ahead and request that. Okay, so what we'll do let me get the rest of the, let me just hold on increasing your a camper say. I know I can, with the current layout results, but I still want to counter hold see. yeah. Okay. Was there anything else we needed to address here. yeah did you have any questions."
14755.0,Patient,"nope yeah I feel like i'm doing pretty good. mean yeah not perfect, obviously, like i'm on a good track."
191.0,Provider,yeah progress.
14755.0,Patient,made yeah it.
191.0,Provider,"Was the same say we. We aim for progress not perfection I tell you, and then they take a burden off of you, where you aim for progress and not perfection. So we've got just sleeping that's a big deal."
14755.0,Patient,yeah drinking alcohol mm hmm.
191.0,Provider,"sounds like no negative side effects on a camper say no. Alcohol withdrawal cravings no relapses. And it looks like from it looks like the mental health peace mental health portion you fill in better. Alright, so let's just keep doing what we're doing, I know I see you every week and i'll let's meet monthly, so this is sort of like a mental health there's a hybrid meeting like mental health follow. For alcohol use okay Dan and if we can't get those layout results and I may have to reorder them again we'll just get them all again okay."
14755.0,Patient,"Okay, and."
191.0,Provider,"yeah and then I want to keep a check on the kidneys let's talk a little bit about your kidneys before I let you go, I want you to Google dash diet. dietary approaches to stop hypertension i'm going to give you the synopsis okay so. high blood pressure, runs in my family and i'm much older to you, and like 50 plus Okay, so this is the way I kept myself from having hypertension, both my parents had it runs in my family. pretty bad and i've had other patients do the same thing and and in the research kind of show, so you want to try to have a low salt diet. I try to keep my sodium less than 1500 milligrams a day if you never add salt to your food there's so much salt in there, that you could still have a hostile die he never even by solder, your home okay so anything in a package anything that's in a box anything that's in a can. that's high sodium until proven otherwise, so I had a tendency to avoid those now I like canned green beans, sometimes I like soup out the cancer, what I do. I take my soup I pour out all the soupy liquid part I rest it shake it up poured out raise it shake it up poured out boiling on the stove I may me some fresh oregano and stuff like that, so I don't miss the salt, because I get the other flavor. And so, one of the things is really protective for the kidneys okay lots of pro not protein actually a lower protein diet, but looking at more fruits and vegetables. yeah yeah having fruits and vegetables that have the potassium so I don't get orange juice, because that a lot of people that promotes weight gain because it's so sweet but blueberries strawberries. Just a few bananas, because you know you can Australia, and if you get diabetes and obesity in your family. got to be careful with sweet stuff so lean more towards like the kale the broccoli to care so every single day my goal is to get at least four or five fruits and vegetables in my diet everyday. Use you accomplish that through a smoothie but a simple approach is you look at your plate every time you get food you look at your plate just look at it and say okay if it's only Brown and white i'm not eating right here Okay, if you look at there's no Green on. Your plate or red or yellow you know you're not eating right. Right Okay, and so it's like Okay, well, I need to add little broccoli Okay, I need add a couple of tears, I find myself getting up in the morning, sometimes. I will literally risk me some care so just be popping them in my mouth also. You have to be deliberate about it because the junk food is so readily available so when the dash diet, at least 30 minutes of exercise usually five days a week, so 100 And what about 150 minutes a week. 45 servings of fruits and vegetables every week low salt diet, no smoking okay minimal alcohol consumption. And so, if you Google dash diet dietary approaches to stop and hypertension, these are the things that you can recommend and even if a person has high blood pressure. On you can help keep your blood pressure from getting higher and maybe not and also many medicines i've had patients on three or four medicines and by the time they started losing weight and changing their diet. blood pressure starts dropping and you have to pull off medicines, which is something you enjoy doing or lowering the amount. So would like for you to get a primary care doctor get your blood pressure and everything checked start a healthy lifestyle change construct controlling that stress is another good thing to. Stress wow that can really make a difference okay. yeah all right, let me do your safety protocol, because we want to see how you fill in on that okay. Have you wish, you were dead or wished, you could go to sleep and not wake up let's say in the past month."
14755.0,Patient,"I mean, maybe like that that start with the very start of the month, but."
191.0,Provider,Like.
14755.0,Patient,October started September 3 of September.
191.0,Provider,"Okay, so we're kind of in October, now has it been a month since Okay, and which one has been night not wake up or wish we did."
14755.0,Patient,not wake up wake up.
191.0,Provider,Okay. Number two have you actually had any thoughts or killing yourself. Right um have you been thinking about how you might do this. Okay. Have you had these thoughts and had some intentions of acting on them.
14755.0,Patient,Okay.
191.0,Provider,Have you started to work out or worked out the details of how you will kill your stuff. Any firearms any guns or anything that you have access to or. what's your reason for living.
14755.0,Patient,My little brother i'm gonna have to watch some day.
