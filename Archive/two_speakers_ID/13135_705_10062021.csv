13135.0,Patient,How are you.
705.0,Provider,Good how are you Margarita.
13135.0,Patient,failed another test.
705.0,Provider,"I feel, your frustration and I hate the word test because it's just like ah."
13135.0,Patient,"yeah and so your guys's letter helped me. For to get into the CSS program and i'm. But i'm still trying to get all the other information, like the IP which board and stuff like that, so they can help me more. But. it's just hard and my Professor the way he's kind of talking he's like well, I guess, I have to give more time, because one of our students has needs more time on testing and that's kind of like. wow you're like. An appropriate what is we'll just say the name who's doing, who is the one that needs the extra help and extra time. In my opinion."
705.0,Provider,it's an appropriate.
13135.0,Patient,"yeah It really is, but I don't know how to approach it because it's like. cuz he's like whoa Like you, I give you all of this and blah blah blah blah blah and i'm just like Okay, and then like today, I had to leave class early. And I had to let him know, even though I failed my test and he's probably he's probably thinking like wow she's leaving early and failed or test, this is why she's not doing good you know what I mean i'm just i'm just I have i'm just thinking of these things that are. In my head that. yeah."
705.0,Provider,"yeah and it's good that you're saying it and it's just I know in group we were talking about this, because it is when you're in class and you're trying to get it and it's all new it's really hard, and if you have a teacher that's not teaching to your style of learning. It can be really challenging and. it's okay to be more motivated to try to find your new way. But, making sure Margarita that you're not then taking this to heart and then all of those core inner feelings come out where it's like I can't get this and then we start crushing on ourselves."
13135.0,Patient,"Well, when I talked to the guy from yesterday at DHS he was like okay. This is what we can you know we're going to do this for you we're going to do that and I was like okay. um he said yeah he says the classes that because i'm take its toll courses, or whatever he says it is pretty high for you, he says he actually recommended that I take like maybe. Like four and whatever, but he said that it was but i'm like well I didn't know my sister in law was the one that signed me up for the classes, I figured she she would know but. she's she's well you know. As far as thinking why she's very well educated and yeah it just so her education compared to my education is it's."
705.0,Provider,it's to me. That comparison where it's like does it. So she learns a different way you learn a different way and we all have different types of smart.
13135.0,Patient,"yeah and yeah, but when I tried to like when I asked my mom for help, or whatever, and, of course, she. threw me off on my sister in law and then she gives me all these books and everything and i'm even looking at the books and i'm just like well what it what what is this and. You know, and now we're learning, you know about the age geez I don't know if you missed those misdiagnosis yeah it's funny. Mr justice yeah it's a oh my God it's just nice to me it's like it's almost like it's match, and as I i'll combine and I was horrible in that oh yeah."
705.0,Provider,"kudos, though, for you Margarita that you're out there and you're trying it there's so many people because of the fear. That they won't even try it and you didn't know you haven't been in school, so you didn't know that the 12 units was going to be like a full time job, while you're trying to manage life. So now, you know that, especially different colleges can be at a different, more advanced sounds like yours is more advance. So being now you have new knowledge can you re evaluate and see what you're comfortable with."
13135.0,Patient,"yeah and he also said I needed, I have to get in touch with the counselor over there, so they can help me like within two weeks, so they can help me go ahead and schedule for my next. coming year or semester, whatever. So i'm like okay he's like yeah The sooner the sooner the better i'm like okay and i'm just trying right now i'm just trying to get all the paperwork for. For what his guy when he wrote up for me my IP i'm thinking it my IP to go over I have to send them all to my teachers. And, and he did that yesterday and i'm just like I had a hard time trying to get everything to move over, especially because I knew today was going to have the test and everything, and I was. That I couldn't do it, it was just I was up until like what almost 12 o'clock last night just trying to get it going and. Making sure that i'm getting this right i'm i'm like. People you know i'm thinking oh they're party to you, you know, taking your time and get you know if you really wanted to get the help, or whatever you should have been on it, you know and i'm just so i'm just trying to get more on it and just go that direction than I need to go. pray and and at some point to Marina that's like."
705.0,Provider,"Thank you for the advice in the future, I will take that, in consideration, but again you've never been through this So how are you supposed to know to start the process."
13135.0,Patient,yeah. yeah.
705.0,Provider,"I hope Margarita at the end of the day, that you take a step back and you just go, you know what I can appreciate myself that i'm out there and i'm trying to make it happen and I don't know yet how you know what's going to be your comfort level because you've never done this before. And I think that."
13135.0,Patient,"I feel like i'm definitely going to be like not passing this class. at all. that's what I feel right now, but like I said i'm not I was telling the counselor yesterday, and I say i'm not quitting I want to keep moving. Just like just like everything else that's going on in my life, right now, you know. just keep moving and try to move on i've been been over here, particularly this entire week just to stay away from the situation over there, because i'm tired of that and every time I come home it's always. Something I don't know if I told you that you know I took a shower but it's seven o'clock in the morning, or something like that, and she got you know my son's girlfriend was all upset because I showered and then she's like oh what time, are you going to be showering and i'm like really."
705.0,Provider,didn't know we needed a schedule.
13135.0,Patient,"I say well you know that we have to go and pick up signing. And i'm like well you know that everything that happened, but you can go to and she's like well, would you go in there because of my daughter how she is, would you go in there, I said well if I really had to go, then yes is. That you know you gotta do what you gotta do you know and again the door was unlocked you know but she's still making it like it was my fault and I don't like that and and my son doesn't stand up for me at all as far as that's concerned. And you know, and my daughter's boyfriend is the same thing you know if she's having a bad day or whatever. And she's talking really or or being nasty towards me he doesn't say anything he rather shut his mouth and not want to get in the position which I understand because the way she is. But there has to be like where's the respect."
705.0,Provider,"Exactly and knowing that you have a place to go it's good that you can escape, and this is probably more short term but thinking to like here you're trying to juggle school trying to live in a household where you feel respected and secure. Now a."
13135.0,Patient,"little bit of respect. For the kitchen. yeah that's my problem. It. But it's more man manageable here course because there's only like two in here so. um but. yeah I mean i'm i'm just like. I really and I even told my boyfriend i'm just like I really need to get a place of my own I just need to get get away, but then. My other counselor the one I told you about you know, I was talking to her about that too, and she was saying it to she was like no. You need to get in place into you have your own, but then I you know I told her I said what, to be honest with you, you know, this is, these are my kids and you know i'm adopted, and this is my family um yes my mother's there at times, but she doesn't help me as far as disbelief this this. And i'm standing up. You know hey don't talk to your mom or hey don't do this don't you know things like that she rewards on them on buying cars and. You know, doing things and it's like no and I tried to teach my kids like hey you have to earn what you get you can't just you can't just get it like that, but you know, like I said, my my mom has spoiled her to support my kids. Which is fine that's that's what grandma's do but. And then you know my counsel is like well can't you just go live with your mom and I think. Well, I would love to, but the problem is, is that she doesn't want me to because she's like I don't know how you're going to be for one minute to the next and I told my mom I was like listen all you have to do is just not push my buttons and will be cool okay. But she likes to push them. yeah. and keep poking and poking and poking. And then she raised me she raises her voice and once you raise your voice i'm done."
705.0,Provider,"yeah having that information, then Margarita do you feel then that really that would work out in the long run anyhow to go to your mom's."
13135.0,Patient,No.
705.0,Provider,"yeah so it's like you're already like okay scratch that and it's okay to like if you don't have to make a decision today about where to live, because I get it, you have your kids you want to be there, but you're still. Trying to deal with all these other stresses and I like your attitude about school where you said i'm not going to give up i'm going to still see it through. I don't know and group, if you heard one of the group members was talking about that she's already retook the same thing I think two if not three times. And so, each time she's building on it, you know what she didn't know before then she's picking that up, but it is just giving it one more go and being like okay if we're going to go to that worst worst case scenario is like the worst that can happen you take it over again."
13135.0,Patient,yeah true.
705.0,Provider,Your experience so as you wouldn't walk in and filling the same because you already have experience and know the basics.
13135.0,Patient,"Yes, I can see that happening. Well, you know my last class that it, you know I don't know if you've ever heard of rfp but rfp was you go to school and you is everything was also a hands on, but it was mainly hands on then going into the book. And, of course, you would also get everything a lot quicker, because you didn't have all those things that you've had to question so but I don't you know everything everything colby colby just stopping everything."
705.0,Provider,"It really be a challenge, and especially with like you're talking about these difference of what it was and and now. we've gotten so used to professors will just put out here's here's the agenda here's what we're going to do, read such and such such and such and such and such here's a test and you get maybe 20 minutes of in a forum with others. I can't even pronounce some of the words that you're wanting and it's like."
13135.0,Patient,"tongue twisters. they're called my mommy let's say their tongue twisters that's why she would say, if you can't pronounce, it is a tongue twister."
705.0,Provider,"yeah it can be, and it can be discouraging at times if already you're having all these other outside read you know stressors. And how to just bring it back and go look just for today, like if it's less stressful for you right now, where you are Margarita, then, can you be there, did you know, like if that's your best place."
13135.0,Patient,"Well, right now, because I have because I. pretty much have been here, like all week but i'm like I have to leave today because tomorrow, I have to go to campus tomorrow so and then you know and then i'll go home, of course I go home tonight for the campus tomorrow. And I don't I don't get out of school until like 945 at night and then. So then, of course I will stay there tonight at my house and then Friday I would leave either in the afternoon or in the evening and come back over here, and then, of course I get that. you're leaving show soon you, you might as well just live over there, you know for my kids."
705.0,Provider,I try and trying to you know. And also.
13135.0,Patient,"I don't know what. I don't know what to do, because it's. And I told him before it's like well I don't want to be here because you guys are in I mean what am I going to do it all I do is I sit down the living room and you guys are in your rooms. wow that's so exciting, for me, you guys don't come out and you guys something you don't talk to me you don't say nothing to me or even asked hey let's go over here, you know you know i'm always. Offering because i'm always watching my dog, you know i'm like hey you know, do you guys want to go for a walk you know, oh no. Okay, fine so then i'll go for my walk or whatever you know, so I try to communicate with them it's more than that don't want to communicate with you or they're having. You know, an attitude, because one is not liking, the other or oh we're both at mad at moms so let's just stay in our room, you know what I mean it's the site. But half of the time it's like what are you even mad about i'm not i'm not even here for you to be upset with me what you know my daughter, I guess, had to go and try to get some food stamps because you know I told him I said well i'm gonna here, why do I need to buy the food, you know. You guys are gonna have to buy food anyways when you guys move out so what's the problem."
705.0,Provider,And that balance to where they want to be independent and then you're giving them some opportunities for that.
13135.0,Patient,"So imagine if I were to move i'm taking the refrigerator where they're going to do, cut the refrigerator in half, and say you're taking this happen you're going to take this APP."
705.0,Provider,"it's. Serious yeah no I all of these things, and especially with i'm hearing, they want you to be there, but then when you're there there's like a level of disrespect and and how to have a healthy conversation. With with whoever is in the household."
13135.0,Patient,"And, as I do that."
705.0,Provider,"that's what I was going to ask you, Margaret is Is it better, if you only talk to it's your son that lives there right."
13135.0,Patient,"it's my son and my daughter, and your partner, both of their partners live in the House, they haven't rooms I sleep in the living."
705.0,Provider,"Is it better, when you have the conversations only with your daughter and son and not with their significant other or is it best to have everybody included."
13135.0,Patient,"I tried that too, I tried doing a group session on all of them, because they were all complaining to me Oh, they are not doing their dishes older not taking out the trash they were all complaining to me and I did at one point I did like. I literally had them acting like children, so I had a little dry erase board right. And I put the chores. And I put the names on there and then I was like okay everybody I want everybody, you know, to help do this stuff here here's a chart you initial on the day that you do it. This is going to be for the whole month and whoever gets the most will get like 100 bucks because of everything that's been going on well Hello. Margarita couldn't afford keep getting out hundred dollars, so I said i'm going to stop doing that you guys are old enough I don't think you guys need to do that um so then. They kind of were like Oh well. You know, there were saying, but we all, you know they were fighting about all we my daughter, with my son, we always are taking out the trash we're always cleaning up the kitchen you guys never do anything so they blame each other. So and that's where you know my you know Andrews girlfriend was buying her own pots and pans and she said i'm on the side so she say well if those are not my pots and pans are on the stove or in the seat, they are not Mike. So now we're going through that we've been going through that and i'm just like Okay, and I can't show these the pots and pans whatever dirty on the stove for. Three four days and I told I think I told you mentioned it in the group one time that you know I you know, I was seeing it they're sitting so of course I picked it up and I washed it and she got wrong text message and just. Like was rambling about the point that I How dare I wash her pots and pans and I frankly told her I said I didn't know, there was a certain way to wash pots and pans. Well, I you know i'm like what are those cleaning persons no she's not if you go into our room is not clean, I mean compared to my cleanness to her cleanness i'm sorry I am more like then she is."
705.0,Provider,Actually that's really challenging that you have then. Like not even knowing rather to clean rather do not clean and it seems like an odd situation.
13135.0,Patient,"Well, I observed, because I sat there because I was thinking you know, like I said, I am in the living room, so I serve I do all the dishes and i'm like okay i'm going to see. I just sit there I don't say anything to anybody i'll just sit there i'll hear that thing whatever going into the sea, whatever I guess at least they're making you to the kitchen, I hear this stuff going into the sea, whatever whatever and then I see everything. and whoever I see you know, after a while just seeing everything for a couple of days, then I went back and i'm like okay hey. You need to go and put that box away, and please do not take it offensive i'm not just telling you i'm telling everybody else that i'm seeing that are not doing their stuff okay. cuz they do don't look at you are you picking on me why are you always seems to me well, because if you don't do something. i'm going to say something. it's just logical right well, for me it is. If you complain about if you complain about something oh my God the trash is overflowing well if you see the tradeshow floor it's not that far from the trash man go take it, I mean it's just simple stupid little things."
705.0,Provider,"And you're trying different ways to cope with it i'm hearing different ways, where you tried the dry erase board you try, giving them the reward."
13135.0,Patient,"If I call the little treasure box he gets get your little little you know, whatever we warned you in like a gift cards danette. I mean it's just ridiculous and that's what i'm saying i'm like you guys are too old for this shit yeah I don't need to do this, you guys should already know how to do this, you guys were I didn't have any made growing up having a well I didn't have any made when they were growing. They were not taught that somebody else has to pick up after that yeah."
705.0,Provider,"And that's really evaluating too, because I know that part of you, you want to be there because you're there your kiddos and it's just like reevaluating with with that situation if that doesn't improve. Then, your decision making a change to where maybe you do want to live on your own."
13135.0,Patient,"I do, and i've already told them and they're like never like so they're basically all just saying, where, will you move out we'll move on. Okay, so i'm like okay so then my already told my Sunday, you know I am going to be moving out and he's like well when you never told me, and I was like really. I told you wait before I even started school, I told all of you what my plan was so don't sit here and say that I did not tell you. that's what that's also upsets me because it's like i'm very Community I communicate a lot to my kids either when i'm here or i'm at home i'm always communicating with them."
705.0,Provider,Right.
13135.0,Patient,My boyfriend gets upset because he's like man he's coming you are checking you if you just see them i'm like yeah but you know.
705.0,Provider,"Exactly and it's really you're in a difficult position, because on the outside your boyfriend is like yeah they shouldn't be calling you but you're the mom and it's a different relationship that you have I mean you've watched them grow."
13135.0,Patient,"That I told him i'm like dude i'm. i'm mom and dad I say you and the other hand, you have. Their mother and your and you are there so two people can handle the situation for the kids where i'm the only one. And I have to handle everything that goes on and that's why I get so irritated and frustrated because i'm the only one, if I even go to my mom like I told you my mom doesn't support anything I say, because then she's like well I don't want to get them upset with me."
705.0,Provider,Yes.
13135.0,Patient,You get on you.
705.0,Provider,"And, and that within itself then Margaret is and. Where does it become where you cut the cord, and you know, some will say where it's like what could be a healthy pullback that you're comfortable with not. Something that your mom advises not something that your boyfriend advises what you feel comfortable with as a form of letting go of some of that where maybe the opportunity for your kids. To be more independent because they're relying on you a lot, because you did have to be both of those people and you've been both the mom and the dad and supportive."
13135.0,Patient,Of it what's the question again i'm just trying to figure out what the question.
705.0,Provider,"I know I look back around. What. You feel comfortable with with pulling a BAT pulling back like being able, where you're not that person that goes through having to dictate when to do this and that having to be that person that they rely on you know because you're communicating but it doesn't seem like. they're really like more responsible yet because maybe the opportunity hasn't been there, so the question though Margaret is. Are you at a place. Where you feel like it's i'm going to move this is when. And having your children be like okay with that. letting go a little bit of that they will figure it out."
13135.0,Patient,"Well, the ones that are living with me. They got it plan supposedly. and the one that moved out, which is my youngest one is the one that wants to come with me when I move. mm hmm so and which you know that's when I was like okay cool and you know my my youngest one is really the one that. I can talk to finance and kind of understands me, but he thinks like sometimes i'm a little overwhelmed to the cuckoo um so that's but yeah he he and I have more of a connection. I right now, I cannot say exactly i'm just waiting because i'm just waiting for, because I get I get the money through my accident my car accident that I was in and i'm supposed to be getting it either this year or next year. And i'm like if I get it this year i'm probably going to want to move out um well i'm hoping, I could find a place, you know at the beginning of the year. that's where i'm hoping where Am I planning on going that i'm unsure because you know where, am I going to be I don't I haven't thought that far ahead because i'm still like here."
705.0,Provider,yeah.
13135.0,Patient,You know I didn't I haven't. I didn't need the other step yet to get to the big picture. yeah should I should.
705.0,Provider,"And that makes sense, so it's like yes, a lot of it is tied to something that's an unknown, because you don't know when that payment is going to get there, so it makes sense that you can't do it. Today, and so getting back to what you can do and are there opportunities that you could take a step back, like if your children say you know they want you to do a certain thing, and you feel like it's an opportunity for them to maybe be more independent."
13135.0,Patient,Like what you can you give me a sample of like what you're trying to say.
705.0,Provider,"Sure, like sometimes um children adult children they rely on you to do all the the laundry just given a scenario. Like all the laundry is your responsibility, so the parent continues to do the laundry only to realize because there's an expectation that you're going to have the clothes ready for me when I go to work and it becomes this thing right. You got your place replace where, then the parent says, this is an opportunity for them to learn. i'm not going to do their laundry anymore, I will teach you once how to do your laundry but then i'm stepping back so I mean I know that's probably not exactly what what you're maybe going through Margarita."
13135.0,Patient,"No, but that's it that should be something you should be telling my mother, but she does that with my brother my sister in law lives with her."
705.0,Provider,"But then, then that's a good example, so you know how that is and it's just like. Yes, we get so tied up into our responsibility and people's expectation becomes ours for at some point is like is this healthy for them as unhealthy for me."
13135.0,Patient,"yeah because the only thing that I get kind of negative with right now with my kid well mainly on my oldest one is just my dog you see still can't get over the fact that I have a support dog. Because I would love to talk to them, and my kids have all gone through counseling and group therapy when they were younger, because you know it helped me to because. The counselors or even talking to me, so it helped me to, and it helped me, you know, help them in the in the future on how to deal with their their problems which I already told you, I still think they need to go back um. Where was I going with this and. I forgot, where I was going with this."
705.0,Provider,"We were talking about your mom and setting maybe you some of those those limits, and I use the laundry example and you said, your mom should tell the brother and sister about that."
13135.0,Patient,"yeah which is shared and I don't know how to really like do that with the other two like, how can I get the money, I can get them to come and sit down, but then the oldest one is he the only one that will be like Oh, here we go, you know. Because he's already thinking oh i'm 24 now we don't need to go through this so."
705.0,Provider,So yeah sometimes it can be two is taking a look at you were saying that they they tend to text you a lot right.
13135.0,Patient,The girlfriend of my son does.
705.0,Provider,uh huh yeah and.
13135.0,Patient,And that's the one that is been really like he told like you told me he's like I just don't I want you to stop being so disrespectful to my girlfriend and and i'm just like. Wait a minute. That towards me. And you're not seeing the other happens is your only end because she comes on me she's like when he comes home and she's you know basically bouboulina him but does he come and ask me about anything that happened know.
705.0,Provider,"How i'm not swearing where the communication to you were sharing that your your boyfriend is like, how come they always you know are reaching out want to know when you're home is would it be healthy, to set the type of boundary that i'm only going to return calls. In between these hours, I mean something like that is a healthy boundary."
13135.0,Patient,"I told her, I told her that I told her that before, when I was working for him, I was like hey. You know don't call me between this time and this time because i'm working I understand it you're home you're not doing anything but i'm working. And I did tell her that he was getting upset you know it's just so regular job you know you're not supposed to be texting or anything anyways when you're working and but I always leave it on me, because my you know, he would go to another location or whatever. And you need to communicate with me so that's. You know by habit and um and I told her like several times and then again she she just kept doing it over and over and over again, and finally, he got really like. You know, got mad he's a and I was just like damn I come down he's like I told you already late. i'm not to have her calling you is you know you were just weren't you were just there why you know why is she doing this and i'm like I don't know I can't I already told her what do you want me to do what else, am I supposed to do, put her on block. Simon. What. you're nodding to both but I don't know which one you want."
705.0,Provider,"What i'm sharing Margarita is, these are both things that you could take into consideration and making it because you're the one that's going to have to live with whatever you decide is that boundary. And so, if you're able to say you know what I would feel comfortable with the block and you block it then Okay, if you want to try first where you silence your phone and you don't respond. Because part of setting a boundary sometimes can be the easier part you said a boundary with someone but she's overstepping that boundary so when she oversaw the boundary. If you answer the call that it encourages her that this no longer is a boundary. And it gets to be this back and forth and it's still it's a struggle Margarita i'm not taking this lightly and that's why you said you're nodding to both. Absolutely, because i'm not the one that's going to have to be there to know that back history and to know how this could be so if you feel that. Maybe putting it on silent may work and you ignore the phone calls, except for in that span of time, you could try that first, before going to me."
13135.0,Patient,"I stopped working. It was too much for me. To do work, work and school. And yeah I just couldn't do and then tried to deal with missy to I still don't have an I don't have a CRATE for her over here for her to stay in because she definitely knows how to jump over those 80 days."
705.0,Provider,off.
13135.0,Patient,And yeah so I I stopped I stopped working. And I stopped working for like I think it's been about a month. Little over a month.
705.0,Provider,Has that helped them with the situation with her calling or texting and wanting your attention.
13135.0,Patient,"yeah she stopped. But i'm thinking Nice because she's been more on my ass and i've been more on like screw you you can't talk to me like this anymore i'm tired of it because I am I told them all, you guys are wearing me down. Please stop please stop please stop please stop anyway stop and it finally wore me down and that's why I had to get into China take on the taking the medications. And going to grow up and trying to do all this stuff and they're seeing it they're seeing a difference now mom you really change around like yeah i'm trying to. You guys have really brought me down hard and maybe I shouldn't said that because probably that gosh probably gave them more power and be like yeah we got mom dad. But no, and i'm and I want my power back so I can put them in place."
705.0,Provider,"You know, to it shows Margarita your your family members that you're human and that you had gotten to a point that you couldn't take it anymore, and that is just like be for them to be more mindful. yeah that it's not just about them they've been so used to it's always been about them and it's just like detachment with love it's like I still love you but handle your stuff I still love you. And I trust that you're going to handle your stuff. And it's right to try to get from where you are now and how to mold that into the new relationship, how to move it from where you've always been there and always been that support person to helping them navigate a little bit more where i'm not always going to be your fix it person."
13135.0,Patient,"gotcha well, maybe I that's what I need to start doing before I actually move out. Because I really thought that I was kind of already doing that, so they would understand how it is when they do about on their own. i'm. always wanted that you know i'm just grateful for, you know that my kids never you know did anything extremely stupid or you know, had to go, and you know anything legal I should say i'm. At least kept. Out of that. Market and."
705.0,Provider,"that's important to i'm sorry to interject because what you're sharing right there. That is so important for them to hear too because they're going to just hear this other part is negative, but you're sharing something that you're really grateful for were exposed that share that to. Before you have that other conversation, because we all get you know we've talked about it, the negative comes through but that's a positive that you worked very hard and they did too."
13135.0,Patient,yeah.
705.0,Provider,that's something to be proud about for your kiddos and for yourself.
13135.0,Patient,"Yes. Yes, so that's what I say, like i'm grateful for that and I showed them that way, even though my mother was like really upset or how. You can have them work they just got out of school, they need to go to school, go to college and i'm like no, they need to go to work, so they can start paying bills and once you get used to that, then you can go to school."
705.0,Provider,And it taught.
13135.0,Patient,"me or. ability, yes, well mad at me for the for like over a year over it. My parents my mom. My."
705.0,Provider,"mom was entitled to her own opinion, they were your kids and you're entitled to your own opinion and guess what sounds to me like your plan worked and it took a lot of work and determination on your part and on there's."
13135.0,Patient,True.
705.0,Provider,"But guess what they don't have legal issues that probably would, if he would have given them ample time to go and do whatever they want it, you gave them structure you give them responsibility Oh, my goodness, you gave them all kinds of things in that experience."
13135.0,Patient,"Well, they also their their their you know their dad side of the family they're up, they were games. They were we don't associate with them because. I remember well when your dad and I had separated before he passed away, and I would always send it to something I also told my other counselor was that. You know I used to take my kids all the time shoot him because I never wanted my kids to think that I was the one that was keeping them away from us. And of course I would also be the ones to supply whatever they needed, so if he didn't have any food I bring groceries and put food in his refrigerator plus I had to give them money to to take care of the kids and I stopped it because i'm. The one of the cousins went and picked up and you're one time, and one of the cousins decided to give. Alcohol to my son, and I was just like what the hell and then you know I saw the dad and then I told him i'm like because my son told me he said. mom I got a headache i'm like well what happened, why you had a headache know he told me because he was he was still young. He always drinking and I was like what What was your dad oh so of course I got on him and I was just like hey. Why is your son, why are you letting your son drink he's like what are you talking about. And i'm like whoa his cousin gave him an alcohol and he's trying he's drunk I guess he got drunk and now he's got a headache and I said how is this cool. And I talked to the cousin to and I told him I said how would you like it if I were to put alcohol and your kids his mouth and you were you know, and you are having your kid come over to visit our family because that's I trusted him to watch watch Andrew. But that didn't happen and then all the other one he's there's a total of 15 kids on that side, so you know every one of them has a problem. And i'm just and I had to like separate from that because they were like calling me and you were threatening me and stuff like that and I had to throw them away and just stop you know and. don't give out my number change my number change, where I am from where I was at because even came over there fuzzy. I had my my other my other house phone they were calling my house phone making all kinds of threats on my phone couldn't do anything because. Why the copter like well no not doing anything physically like but Hello they're making phone threats they're like that's just verbal they're not doing anything. So as and that's why I say like I don't even have the support on next side of the family, because I don't talk to them, and nor do my kids, thank God, because. Even the grandkids that are even the same a roughly around the same age as my kids are either selling drugs or they're in prison or they're doing something that they're not supposed to do. So and i've always said no you're not going over you know you're not going over that you're staying over here every time people, whether you're causing problems for me, why are you causing problems for me, because you want to go over this. And then finally realized well well yeah you're right mom they're causing pumps through you know I don't want to go over there and cut yeah. And it was."
705.0,Provider,"You that it right, and especially if you have family history of within the games and that looks enticing to someone really young and that you pretty much as a single parents. were able to combat that and get them redirected in the right way again, those are huge challenges. That you were able to be successful at that they didn't join the games and that the kids to were able to listen to you. Where they didn't fall into that because, as you know, it's really easy when you're looking at easy money, and this is what some of your influences are that are family it's easy to fall there. However, you stepped in and you were the parent that they needed you to be Margarita. Which is why they are where they are today."
13135.0,Patient,"again. Yes. yeah just yes again yes. hmm and they have any you know they they'll check up on them, or whatever on Facebook, or whatever and they'll see what they're doing and know what's going on with them and um. yeah and I try to you know just I mean I look at him to you know she's like Andrew has a brother who's only two days older than him and how do you figure two days older. um he he's pretty much homeless and i'm and i'm looking at my kids i'm like this is your brother and. loose night out industry should be helping him, but you know I could. I they just don't want to go there, I don't know because I I kind of feel bad for him, I wish I could help him but."
705.0,Provider,"it's a to me Margarita your plate is already so full and I say you know if you feel like you have food and you want to get food, water or something."
13135.0,Patient,"yeah it will he over here. yeah I guess he came over to the House, and when I wasn't there he came over and here's this the brother his name is Joseph. He came over to the House and he asked, he says hey can I get something to eat i'm having eight and they're like. Okay, and they gave them like a little cup of noodles and i'm like dude we have like stuff in the end there's could have made him a sandwich or something not just cup of noodles Oh well, it's not my stuff i'm like. I have never seen never in my life. raise such agreed to me that's great if a person is you know hungry and starving and they are you know they look like they need a shower. And you can provide all that, then I think you should do it out of your own heart and your kindness, you know, and I just sit here and be like oh there's that loser, you know he's not doing anything for his life, you know, and I, so I feel bad for them. And I even told them i'm like that's not stuff that you guys didn't like actually making something you only gave them a little cup of you."
705.0,Provider,"I know Margarita and it's like is it that they don't have that life experience yet either, because until you put that to the forefront. They didn't even realize that yeah I could have given a more they were just thinking he's there, maybe I want to get them out of my way a cup of noodles won't take too long, I don't know what the thinking was. But you're planting the seed, you could offer more and have some empathy because most people are a paycheck away from being homeless. yeah i'm in that situation happen."
13135.0,Patient,"yeah yeah and yeah that's good yeah cuz you know my son was all you know complaining oh boo boo boo so my my daughter went somewhere up to oakland. To try to you know, to go to. Her boyfriend's mom's house to sign up for food stamps and i'm just like okay. And then I don't know I don't know how to help my daughter because she's been like just dropping everything striping school pretty much Dr courses. She wants to quit her job and. I don't know how I can talk to her to be like hey you know. You got to do something, because this is not good."
705.0,Provider,Is.
13135.0,Patient,"There, how can I, how can I help her because the boyfriend doesn't work. Looking doesn't work and they're planning on book dropping out of class."
705.0,Provider,Oh go ahead and Margaret.
13135.0,Patient,"She and she is on the. She gets the school money faster from the school. Right and so she's been getting that but I don't know I think she's only keeping like 111 class, and I would say, how is that going to work for you and you know. i'm kind of i'm kind of worried, for her i'm really worried, for her because her moods are just like mine."
705.0,Provider,that's why I asked you okay yeah.
13135.0,Patient,"yeah she's on it she's not on any type of medication, I tried to get her to go to counseling or try to find somebody can go to get her on counseling to go or and to you know get on some type of medication. And she just I don't know how to to tell her, she really needs to do this because it's affecting her."
705.0,Provider,"Now, and so. Everything."
13135.0,Patient,"She is she's giving up everything I mean she has a really good job you know working at Disneyland. And she's she's planning on just doing that she's like I don't even like working and she used to love it and now she doesn't like it, and the school she's like the school and now she just doesn't doesn't have it like in her mind that she doesn't even want to be in school."
705.0,Provider,And she's never been open to maybe trying medication to see if it could help with her moods.
13135.0,Patient,"I have tried to talk to her, especially when she's like in her emotional stages and I told her I said, look at here's a prime example, but it does for you. And then another prime example of who you are okay, because you knew you knew how I was how my actions and I was going up and down and i'm still kind of little going up and down. But I need to pick up my new medication and but i'm just trying to tell you that it's it will help you you just have to do it. yeah oh and."
705.0,Provider,"Sometimes weeks, but you know it eases it, at least where you can do you can take a moment or you have that ability that without medication sometimes you don't do you have Margarita to um sometimes with today's generation they like to text so there's 741741."
13135.0,Patient,yeah I heard that one.
705.0,Provider,"Okay it's a text crisis line and so maybe if she won't listen to you, you could at least give her like hey, this is a resource that the to talk about, but she can talk with a crisis counselor and hearing it from someone else, maybe."
13135.0,Patient,Your mom.
705.0,Provider,yeah gotcha even though it's great how you're saying like i'm a prime example of when I didn't treat it versus now i'm treating it and managing and that's what it's all.
13135.0,Patient,"i've only said that because I mean Come on, I mean we are like everybody says you guys are twins so that's why I say that to her and i've even told her i'm like come on Isabel you know to you used to she used to be on concert. When she was younger. And you know and for a long period of time she was on concert and that's why i'm just like listen you think about it. What you had to. What you already did and yeah you want it to stop it, because you want it, you know, whatever it was up to you, I can't after your 18 I couldn't I couldn't close out of control and I couldn't do anything. Now, so, but you know i'm really i'm just really concerned on. How to. help her. succeed and get what she what she should have. I also know that he's an adult."
705.0,Provider,"True, and. It doesn't make it any easier, because this is your child that you love and it's like you're recognizing it because you know for yourself having a mental health disorder. It can be managed but it's when it's not managed, that is so concerning and you're seeing this by her wanting to drop everything like it's already hard to stay motivated and without medication sometimes you can't get even to that level don't want to get out of bed."
13135.0,Patient,"yeah. I see that, too, she gets up very, very late one o'clock."
705.0,Provider,In.
13135.0,Patient,"The afternoon, sometimes and. Now she just. stays in a room."
705.0,Provider,"And, and when you feel Margarita, the opportunity is there, you know just I come, I come in peace, I come with love here's my concern I love you to death, would you be more open to talking to someone else, or at least call when you're feeling down like get her in the habit."
13135.0,Patient,"yeah i'm going to go home and i'm going to talk to her. Today, and see how what I can do."
705.0,Provider,"And that's that's good I know Margarita you're about helping everyone else, and I think that that's great and you're very giving and now bringing it back to you is how do we get you through we're taking it through today. What can you do."
13135.0,Patient,"Today yeah, what can I do today."
705.0,Provider,"What. Well, today for yourself."
13135.0,Patient,"Today, what can I say for myself today. Better good. Oh. Good dad. i'm not emotional today."
705.0,Provider,"Okay, so you feel like you're more at a stable area more balance."
13135.0,Patient,"yeah more like i'm calm right now. mm hmm um. Even though I failed my class, I mean like like test okay um what else can I Oh, what can I do for myself. No, I don't really I don't know because I don't really do much for myself."
705.0,Provider,I know and that's. Why i'm bringing it back to you Margarita. you're taking everyone else.
13135.0,Patient,"Okay, is that a homework assignment, can I just turn it in. To get over it."
705.0,Provider,"He Margarita you take like you have your support puppy even if it's just taking a little support puppy out for a walk looking at the sky and just not have to worry about anybody else's needs, but your own for a moment. So keep that in mind, give yourself permission to take a 10 minute break a 15 minute break."
13135.0,Patient,Okay.
705.0,Provider,"And I definitely don't want it to feel like Margarita day does homework, this is not what this is the hell. No."
13135.0,Patient,"I do, I, like everything is homework. Like no."
705.0,Provider,Please.
13135.0,Patient,If you I had like sweat like so.
705.0,Provider,"it's finding and sometimes it may take a while, if the walk and the puppy doesn't do it then find something else. But be able to see where. If I leave and go outside for 1015 minutes, could it be more refreshing and i'm able to hit reset and look at things even differently when I come back in."
13135.0,Patient,Okay.
705.0,Provider,"And sometimes I know i've even taken the time like, if you want to get your nails done or painting your nails you don't have time you don't have time and then you paint them in your life. I look at them when I smile and i'm like dang Okay, I like this color like those are things for yourself to self care."

13135.0,Patient,yeah.
705.0,Provider,"And Margaret you've made tons of progress, even in the last couple of weeks, I can see how you carry yourself a month ago, if you had what the test and seeing that on paper oh I didn't do as well, it would have not been how you handled it today. Today you're like taking it in stride so again write down your wins think of your wins we'll talk on Tuesday, then. Okay, all right Margarita how about. You too."
