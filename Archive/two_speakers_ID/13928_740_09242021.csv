And he's just he's a horrible man he's a horrible guy I know him from he was friends with my friends, when we were kids and. Just this is people know things about me that I have no idea about and and juris, my friend, I guess that knew him I knew about him being my brother, but she never told me anything about it."
740.0,Provider,and
13928.0,Patient,And it's like it's like all these people have all these secrets that they know about me but I don't know anything for sure I just know what people have talked about in front of me I know. I just know my mom's alive.

13928.0,Patient,yeah yeah something I just have to deal with.
740.0,Provider,Have you. Have you ever spoken with your mom about it.
13928.0,Patient,"Oh yeah yeah and she shuts me down and. She makes me feel. She tries to make me feel stupid. Like like the way she talks to me about it, I don't know what i'm talking about and i'm crazy and in she she hasn't seen michaels since he was in diapers and. it's like, no, no, you can't say that because the kids have said too many things in front of me for me to know. I don't know and there's other things too there's like. I had a friend who. said there's people trying to kill them. And three days later he died. and i'm just. Just things is is like. Like people were out to kill him and they like killed him. And, and he tried to go to the police saying people were out to kill them you tried to go to the psychic that's down in Gresham you try to go to the psychic and say there's people trying to kill me, I think, and because he was a bartender. appear on on mountain. And I I just gather that that he fed alcohol to the wicked people you know, whoever they are and he he found out things like like he tried to explain to me that that sometimes when people die it's a it's a good thing for people, or just a weird weird. cult like stuff he he was talking about like like there was a cult after him or something and. And it's just weird as the stuff that I know about it is, is just comes from one conversation I had with him and and I know that these people exist because. Because when he was talking to me some guy came up to him and started trying to talk to him. try and get his attention and Jeffrey said to the guy hey you guys will have your time with me this weekend when they kill them. You guys will have your time with me this weekend just let me talk to my friend, right now, just let me have my moments with my friend kendra right now. And the guy just brushed it off because I was looking at him like what are you doing here in the guy just brushed it off like yeah okay okay i'll give me your time yeah sure. and yeah they killed him three days later and it's not known to the police it's not known. it's oh Oh, and then, and then I think my kid's dad killed his brother. Because he was on medication, he was gets abused paranoid schizophrenic which I don't know I kind of think he was his family that made him think he was that but anyway. TIM TIM TIM, he is to take medication at night that used to knock him out not just knocking out to the point where he would he would go to the bathroom while he slept because he was so out of it when he would take those pills and. And I know this because I was the one that would clean up the mess I would I would you know wash the blankets, you know that I was going to put down for him, I I I would get the bed ready for them. From sleep. Because you know I had to take care of it, because nobody else would and. So I know for a fact you did not get up in real tonight and get a sandwich and take a bite of it and choke on it all right, I think, somebody and the only person that it could be is Tony his brother. took a piece of sandwich and shoved it down his throat, making it look like TIM. Making it look like TIM woke up in the middle of the night went to the refrigerator got a sandwich to goodbye in an inhaled it and then died. Which is impossible, he could not have gotten up in the middle of the night because remember I used to clean up his pee and poop. When he would sleep there's no way that man could have gone up in the middle of the night and gone to the refrigerator you know I have, I have these things in my head. That make me end up sounding like a crazy person."
740.0,Provider,mm hmm.
13928.0,Patient,"But I know what these things really happen. yeah I really did have to clean his his he would go to the bathroom in the middle of the night to seems so out of it. there's no way he could have gotten up. and got the sandwich and in taking a bite. In died there in the living room at night. And Jeffrey at heart, told me there is people trying to kill him. And he told me to watch my boyfriend. Because he thought it was him. and I told you know, like to hold it because I took seroquel I take circle."
740.0,Provider,But.
13928.0,Patient,"Back then, I used to take it to the point where he just knocked me out, and I was out for the whole entire night now I only take half of that so it doesn't take. Only 50 milligrams instead of 200 milligrams but but I told Jeffrey that I couldn't watch billy in the middle of the night. Because oh sorry I take medication and knocks me out at night and that's what I said, and that that was my That was my reaction to him, asking me to watch out tell me to watch out for billion see if he leaves in the middle of the night. And billy billy is my boyfriend's that i've had for. 14 years. You know, but all this stuff all the stuff that i'm talking to you about sounds like delusions and they scare me because the people that I talked to about it say it's not real. The. I mean there's no way anybody could know that mean jeffrey's conversation was real or not, because I was there I was, I was, I was there, nobody else was there, so nobody else can tell me that my conversation with Jeffrey didn't happen. But billy tries to brush it off like. Like i'm just stupid and I don't know what i'm talking about you know, instead of thinking to themselves. Oh, what is camera saying what did Jeffrey say that kendra what you know being concerned about what Jeffrey was saying he he just doesn't care he just he thinks that it's stupid and that it's not real or something or. I don't know. But, well, I remember it, I was there."

And the guys that creeps absolute criminal creep lizard is those of his parents gee what happened is my mom had sex with her foster father. and She was only 16 and the Foster Father in the Foster mother ended up adopting the kids and taking care of it in now he's become Ryan frazier. And Ryan frazier is a criminal is. He schizophrenia he's he's just he's not okay he's not Okay, and then and. Then and. yeah he he told me that he was adopted. And when we are six when I was 17 he was 19 he told me he was adopted, and you just met his mother well my mother had just put. A sign the thing that told Michael that since he was 18 he could come look for her, and this was her address. And that's what my mom did and that's what she explained to me, she did and then that's what Ryan did and that's what Ryan explained to me he did. And it's just kind of like the to kind of go together and it's like they just they just want me to pretend it's not real and they don't. My mom doesn't want to have to admit that she had sex with somebody else's husband had her baby and had his baby, and you know just she's just garbage my mother is just garbage. She. She just and you know, and then I got to deal with that I have to deal with the fact that I hate my mom in who wants to hate their mom nobody wants to eat your mom everybody wants to be loved by their mom and. taking care of by their mom. But my mom doesn't do that and I hated her for it. And she's just a horrible person horrible person. And I just have to. accept it. Go on, go on with my day."

Because my grandma's a bitch and send that I had to take her. Even though I never talked to her, she never talks to me. but also my mom needed to go to the doctor appointment, I was, I was the one who is supposed to take her. Eventually, I got billy to say yes to taking my mom and it was just. You know. If she's gonna be a hypochondriac and make up things that are wrong with her and then go to the doctor about it. don't include me in your game. Then I just I I haven't talked to her site lead up to the doctor. and That was it I haven't talked to her, since I haven't called her, and that was like weeks those months ago actually. A bit, but it's kind of my way of saying don't get me involved with your fiasco with doctors and stuff don't if you want to play like you're so sick then go into a home where they're supposed to take care of you, you know don't expect anything from me. i've been open to let down i've been lied to i've been I just been to let down to be there for her. I don't want to be there for her, in fact, I want to not be there for her. Because the way she has her me my mother isn't there for me. i'm not there for her. which makes me a psychopath I think it makes me. It makes me ill because. She is a bitch."
740.0,Provider,"Well, how did that make you fat and make you ill if that's. The."
13928.0,Patient,"case she. Because. Because you're supposed to love your mother there's people they don't have their mother anymore and they're like how could you say you hate your mother. Like whoa I don't have the good mom you have I don't I don't I don't get the good stuff that you got from your mom I I don't expect me to love and adore my mother. because she treats me like shit she doesn't treat me like the way your mother treats you she treats me bad and I don't want to be treated bad and and I think it just makes me sick It makes me look ill, because people aren't supposed to hate their mothers."
740.0,Provider,"I mean, even if it's not a favorable favorable situation, of course, no one will want to hate their mom. However, it doesn't make you look at Oh, it just makes it makes you. This sounds like you're hurting."

740.0,Provider,We too much credit okay. i'll give it to my creativity i'll do the best that I came. out I won't know kind of pressure i'm.
13928.0,Patient,thinking.
740.0,Provider,"Oh, what are some other stressors that are going on in your life."
13928.0,Patient,"um. My boyfriend and I. He. He he, like you went to town without me he just left me at home, he didn't tell me, he was going into town and going to town means driving a half hour one way and. And he didn't go in and he didn't take me because he was gonna go look for chairs because we're going to a concert today. which I only want to go to the concert with them he's. he's just a deck in and he. And he and i'm. I over exaggerated right over. overreaction because he went to town without me he just left me at home, like like like the dog look at it like a couch like a chair. Like a piece of furniture just left me at home, like a piece of furniture and he went out to town to go look for the chairs, that we need for the concert, they will What about me why don't you get me involved why can't I be a part of you going and looking for chairs, you know, and he. You know first us brushed it off like it was nothing but then he saw that I was really seriously upset I wasn't just brushing it off like it was nothing because. it's it's upsetting to me because you know I never get off this mountain and you know, we need to get chairs for the concert. Which he's not going to find he says he said he could find but he's not going to be able to find because everywhere around everyone around here wants to go to a concert, where you have to have the eight inch the chairs that are like eight inches from the ground. And he was thinking, instead of letting me buy them months earlier. On Amazon, you told me not to buy them and that you was just going to go look for them. The he was just going to go look for him later, and you know i'm and I let it happen and now he did we don't have chairs, because we didn't do it my way. And then, it looks like i'm we always have to do things my way because. Because, because I it's all about me but it's not all about me it's just because I know how to do things the right way, like I could have daughters chairs in the mail brought to our House.
