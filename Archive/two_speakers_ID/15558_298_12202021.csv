15558.0,Patient,Hello hear me.
298.0,Provider,"Wendy yeah when do you fly out, are you already there."
15558.0,Patient,i'm already there.
298.0,Provider,howdy how's it going. Terrible home oh now did you pick up your prescription.
15558.0,Patient,"yeah i'm trying. propanol or whatever it's called right now but. I don't like in such a rage that I don't think that anything is gonna work, let alone that."
298.0,Provider,"Okay, so you know my tricks of the trade, the ice how to use the ice. And I talked to her."
15558.0,Patient,"This is different, though it's."
298.0,Provider,i'm just trying to.
15558.0,Patient,"I know i'm trying to. I just basically, I found out last night that. One of our neighbors and we're a little took advantage of my little sister and i'd never known anything about it, so I just found out some like. You know fucking rage."
298.0,Provider,Okay. that's heavy. Heavy.
15558.0,Patient,"No, no. I don't know like i'm. I mean I don't know I mean obviously everything's recorded, but I don't know what you see like about, but when I talk about what this Christine is. for lack of a better word like. i'm heavily connected to the Chicago outfit. Mafia so like a lot of my friends are either made members or their fathers were made members and like one of my friends, that is, the boss right now. So, like i'm in such a rage that. i'm talking to them and they're telling me. to calm the Fuck down and to figure out a way to deal with it somewhere at some some other way, like what they're suggesting isn't exactly the best thing neither but they're suggesting just. Use connections with the police or something or just do something to get him put in jail for something and then the prisoners will take care of it. Like that's just that's the same as fucking doing something yourself like I don't want to go that route, with it, but. it's just something that i've never, never even imagined. Like of all this shit like that we've gone through that's, the last thing because I always felt like all someone would do is just say the word and it will be dealt with, but she has never told anybody."
298.0,Provider,i'm sorry James sorry you're going through this.
15558.0,Patient,"it's not. it's not me that i'm worried about but it's it all makes sense because she's got way worse anxiety than I do, like she's got. way worse than me and then she has a stomach issues that she can't take a lot of prescription drugs so like she says to cook and deal with it. But this is the first i've ever heard about it. And like thank God she told me when on the car on the way back from the airport, when I was like heavily medicated on xanax but even then it was still like. I don't know it's hard to. Even just think about like. So I don't know like I woke up. More panicky then anxiety, so I tried the propanol or whatever and, but that was maybe I took two hours ago but it's. I don't think it's met down something on that level."
298.0,Provider,"Now. But, also, that level takes us down X."
15558.0,Patient,"But I also like at the same time I don't want to take xanax either because I. Even though, like I don't have any problem like i've even now like I don't have a feeling that going to take a xanax but, like in my back of my mind, is always thought that. If I use that as a crutch then that's how it becomes like an addiction problem, so I don't want to feel like every time I feel i'm in a state of panic or something that I need to like pop a fucking xanax but that's what i'm trying to propanol or whatever right now. And then i'm going to after this i'm going to go walk around the neighborhood trying to just like get the energy out because i'm sure it didn't help that I was sitting on airplanes for eight hours. Prior to hearing."
298.0,Provider,"yeah. Well, you you've developed some skills right."
15558.0,Patient,"Oh, I can tell you that if I had not been involved in this. program like, if I had not done anything like and then found this out like that. That guy would be gone already. without hesitation. Trying to like luckily now, I have a state of mind where I don't just. Immediately like go into a fucking rage and just deal with it, but. it's hard."
298.0,Provider,"Let it out when you, you know, let it out talk to Christine tell me tell me what you're feeling instead of letting it bottle up. If you. i'm i'm speaking from watching my husband go through something similar Lee and he needed to get it out, otherwise he played out role play after role play in his mind of scenarios and that wasn't healthy either."
15558.0,Patient,"yeah no that's definitely I mean my mind that's where my mind immediately goes is just deal with it and then like. it's. there's that it's like the mix of like I have to do something about it, combined with. In the back of my head, I always feel like something like that. when something happens to someone like that the chances of a 12 person jury all unanimous unanimously convicting are very low it's like that's where my mind goes is like they'll never like they would never convict because. The jury would always have in the mind like what happened prior but that's like the worst fucking thinking because. Like in my head that's. Above the fear of prison. Like letting someone get away with That to me is worse than spending the rest of my life in prison because at least i'd be in prison, knowing that I fucking did something about it."
298.0,Provider,But you're you're smart guy you going to prison is not going to fix anything.
15558.0,Patient,"No, no, no."
298.0,Provider,Now so i'm.
15558.0,Patient,"trying to figure out like how to deal with it because I mean. Just the common sense. tells you that someone like that it's not just one person so there's trying to like concocted some way to like just. get this fucking dude in jail, basically, like the right way."
298.0,Provider,I like the way you're thinking.
15558.0,Patient,"I was like I don't know because I mean I haven't even. lived in that town 11 years but I mean I already fucking had some look into I already have his address and everything but. So I know he's still there he's still alive, but. it's not something where like. I don't know that it's really hard to explain the only thing I can explain is that it's a good thing that i'm in this right now, or else it would have already been dealt with."
298.0,Provider,"So what's admirable about what you're telling me. I hope this comes out right if it comes out wrong forgive me for for it coming out wrong. What I hear is, you have a love for your sister that is very deep and your anger towards this situation tells me that this is this is very passionate and i'm sure that. Your sister has opinions on what she would like done but just her knowing that you're volatile about it will be a little comforting to her, because it validates that it was wrong and sometimes when you're looking at when when the person who's been abused was abused years ago. Sometimes they feel like. People don't believe them or they just are not a valuable person and by you, showing how much you care not to do something, but just to verbally tell her I am angry is very validating to her. For whatever that's where. Take it."
15558.0,Patient,yeah.
298.0,Provider,yeah.
15558.0,Patient,"it's just I don't know it's. The whole thing was a very, very shocking to me. Because of all this shit that's one thing that I never even considered like. at all. Because we were always. taught to deal with it. Like we always like if somebody ever picked on me, I came back for my brother and we went back there and. kick the shit out of just one of those things like just. that's something that you never worry about like our concern was always. Like the parents just not financially supporting and, like the regular stuff like that, like, I never considered like the forum board and of it. And then I think it's I don't know it's just. was not expecting to fucking hear that at all. But i'm glad that I didn't hear it before because."
298.0,Provider,You weren't ready.
15558.0,Patient,yeah it would have they would have been bad. You should be reading about me in the newspaper about talking to be in zoom.
298.0,Provider,"i'm. Just a thought um it's really separate from anything that that's going on here, but you mentioned that your sister has stomach problems and anxiety and. i've learned that there's a medication out there to look at when somebody has stomach problems like that and that's the murtaza team that you're taking and so. Anyway, just put that in the back of your head that murtaza pain for those people seems to help in in like little."
15558.0,Patient,"actually mentioned that I actually mentioned that when I was talking about. The medications that i'm on that that one in particular. Like puts me to sleep song to me out for like good seven eight hours it's like. really good night's sleep and it doesn't really. Other than that, I don't you know it doesn't have like a high impact or anything like that so like I mentioned that and she said that she's never taken it before so. But now that you're now that you're saying that to then. i'll bring it up again, because that makes sense."
298.0,Provider,"yeah it's really easy on the stomach and so that's that's the go to for stomach problems once. So i'm well. Thank you for sharing and and. get your support system, I don't think I like who you're talking to, on the other end. who your friends are but i'm sure there's they're telling you they're telling you better advice than I expected."
15558.0,Patient,One they're also like. they're actually my friends like that's the thing that's like gets misconstrued like their parents that awful awful shit like I never knew anything about it until the Google age came. And you could start googling these people's names and then you start seeing all the stuff but like they were never that way with me and a lot of their fathers were friends with my grandpa but they're all like the old school just handle your business somebody says.
298.0,Provider,something to you break their jaw like just.
15558.0,Patient,"deal with it. But now they're all. I mean they're more modern so it's not like the old school, especially Chicago in general, like they got very smart and realize that the government had a plan to take everyone down so they all like. Divided into like crews and it's very, very frowned upon to like. Physical violence and stuff like that."
298.0,Provider,But.
15558.0,Patient,So that's why like when i'm telling them they're all like Tommy calm down need to calm down smarter way to deal with it like you can get this motherfucker another way like and it's really weird hearing that from these people. Because it makes me think like how about Am I where i'm being calm down by these fucking people.
298.0,Provider,"So. um please hear me when I say that your sisters very sensitive right now, because she's told you she's watching you and you, you become confident in something that's very she's pulled his she felt very close to her, so what you do at affirming her. is more important than what you do to that other person."
15558.0,Patient,I agree.
298.0,Provider,"Okay. All right, I hope that you didn't take that as talking down to you I just. yeah."
15558.0,Patient,"No, I get it it's it's sensitive situation for sure."
298.0,Provider,That sensitive and these hours are very sensitive is as she's watching you. and seeing how.
15558.0,Patient,"When I always every Friday in the group I always feel I always felt like wow like. These people have it. So much worse and like they're dealing with all so I get never considered that, like. that's going that was basically happening around me. Because I always felt like when I hear these like because just hearing them, and these are people that I only know from Group and So they're essentially strangers, and even hear it from them makes my blood boil."
298.0,Provider,I know I remember. You just reason. yeah. you're a good soul. Anything I can do for you today.
15558.0,Patient,"No i'm gonna try, well, I guess, the only question would be i'm going to try to take another the propanol or whatever, but if that doesn't work like if I wait till later on. If I take something else, is it going to mix like Is there going to be a bad reaction with that."
298.0,Provider,Not at all.
15558.0,Patient,"And then future reference, with that I just once I started taking these medications I just quit taking any type of allergy like anything like that, but does that mix with it at all. No, it doesn't always felt like. It doesn't. Because I always worried because anti histamine I know affects heart rate and I know with the directions on the xanax assess to be careful with anything else that affects your heart rate so like I won't I won't even take ibuprofen when i'm on it, because i'm all paranoid about mixing."
298.0,Provider,"it's pretty mild you're on a very low dose if you took an Anti histamine it would only support the calm down mode so. Even cutting a benadryl and half and just taking a half of 12.5. would support the calm down stuff. Okay, take care, James i'll be thinking that the."
15558.0,Patient,"Alright, and then we don't have group for two weeks right."
298.0,Provider,Unless you want to go to a 10am group on Friday. there's Julie is running a 10am group for anybody who just wants to come to group.
15558.0,Patient,"Okay well i'll see if i'm not. worried about the mandatory like I know other people like have to be forced to this because they don't like talking about it, but like for me that's not an issue like. I just want to make sure if i'm still feeling heated by them that I can do something, but i'll be talking to Christine on Thursday anyway, I forgot about that."
298.0,Provider,"i'm glad to hear that. Okay, take care, James."
15558.0,Patient,You as well.
298.0,Provider,Christmas.
15558.0,Patient,Merry Christmas.
