No it's not that missionary but the thing is this is that we're Tele health Program. And we have to be able to ensure that you're safe and we've had people that we've had to send to a higher level of care if appointments are not being kept if. we're not getting this is just an example if there's urine drug screen that may not be getting done if there's alcohol use and we've got other medications being used we've got you on the gabba penton and buprenorphine a lot song if medicines are not being taken. As prescribed so when we look at it it's not about not liking you as a person, do you know totally just totally enjoy having you as a patient, but the thing is this sherry, along with the oxygen needs and everything that's required. And with the alcohol use then sherry will concern that it could get really unsafe and we're not able to monitor you as closely because physically we're not seeing you. or not able to get the urine drug screens in person, so. The concern is for your safety that you do need to have a place that you're in person, they can do breathalyzers to to look at alcohol use they can you know you can more readily collect to your when you come there as opposed to waiting for your Cup to get to you. If you're breathing they have pulse ox machines there they some places may even have oxygen so that they're there with you and with the ongoing decline of your breathing. So yeah so I can see the benefit of telemedicine, but I just believe that, as your situation and your health gets to be more challenging the pain gets to be more challenging there needs to be more of an A. let's say a higher level of care to monitor you watch you and make certain that you're safe. yeah so and so we're willing, if you want to continue with the therapy, but need you to get your medicines, so that you're actually going in and seeing someone. So yeah, but if you say how do we, on a personal and professional level, how do we feel about missionary missionary is a wonderful group member Okay, but safety reason we have to be able to know that what we're doing is is going to be safe for you. need to go to a higher level of care and we need to make certain that you're good and that you're stable at this point in time, with your chronic conditions i'm greatly, I do believe that you need a higher level of care. For your safety, so that will be something we will have to review and have to be in close contact with your primary care doctor and work be able to collaborate closely with the primary care doctor, to see if you're safe safe. yeah so. yeah. Was. Saying you're going to see the heart doctor on Monday. i'm sorry, you see, who do you see on Monday missionary.

OK. OK OK right great great. Alright, and then just with it mixing that with you know, doing the alcohol and doing that, with the buprenorphine or anything, especially with the your lungs being as sensitive as they are needing the oxygen um because my understanding uni is it six or seven liters of options now.
